This action will activate the modified `pg_hba.conf` file.

### 6.2 Creating a Publication
Creating a publication involves the following steps:
1. Registering the publication server.
2. Adding the master definition node.
3. Creating a publication by selecting the tables and defining conflict resolution options.
4. Defining table filters for any master nodes.

#### 6.2.1 Registering a Publication Server
Registering a publication server follows the same process as single-master replication. Refer to Section 5.2.1 for detailed instructions on registering a publication server.

**Figure 6-1: Replication tree after registering a publication server**

Upon successful registration of the publication server, the xDB Replication Console's replication tree will display a **Publication Server** node, under which you will find **SMR** and **MMR** type nodes. Continue building the multi-master replication system under the **MMR** type node.

#### 6.2.2 Adding the Master Definition Node
The first database to be identified to the xDB Replication Server is the master definition node. This is achieved by creating a publication database definition subordinate to the **MMR** type node under the **Publication Server** node.

Once the publication database definition is created, a **Publication Database** node representing the master definition node will appear in the replication tree of the xDB Replication Console. You can then create a publication containing tables from this database under the **Publication Database** node.

When creating the publication database definition, you must provide database connection information such as the database server network address, database identifier, and database login credentials. This information is used by the publication server to access the publication tables during replication.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. Ensure that the database server for the master definition node is running and accepting client connections.
2. Select the **MMR** type node under the **Publication Server** node. From the **Publication** menu, choose **Publication Database**, and then select **Add Database**. Alternatively, right-click the **MMR** type node and choose **Add Database**. The **Publication Service – Add Database** dialog box will appear.
3. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Database Type**: Select either **PostgreSQL** or **Postgres Plus Advanced Server** for the master definition node. For an Oracle-compatible installation, select **Postgres Plus Advanced Server**. For PostgreSQL or a PostgreSQL-compatible installation, select **PostgreSQL**.
   - **Host**: Enter the IP address of the host where the master definition node is running.
   - **Port**: Specify the port on which the master definition node is listening for connections.
   - **User**: Enter the database user name for the master definition node.
   - **Password**: Provide the password for the database user.
   - **Database**: Enter the database name of the master definition node.
   - **URL Options (For SSL connectivity)**: Enter the URL options to establish SSL connectivity to the master definition node. Refer to Section 7.11 for more information on using SSL connections.
   - **Changeset Logging (For Postgres)**: Select **Table Triggers** for trigger-based synchronization replication or **WAL Stream** for log-based synchronization replication. See Sections 2.2.9 and 2.2.10 for details on these methods.
   - **Node Priority Level**: Assign a priority level between 1 and 10 for conflict resolution based on node priority. The highest priority is 1, and the lowest is 10. The default for the master definition node is 1. Refer to Section 6.6.4 for more information on conflict resolution strategies.

**Figure 6-2: Publication Service - Add Database dialog box for the master definition node**

4. Click the **Test** button. If the test is successful, click **OK** and then **Save**.

**Figure 6-3: Successful master definition node test**

If an error message appears, investigate the cause, correct the issue, and repeat steps 1 through 4.

Upon successfully saving the publication database definition, a **Publication Database** node will be added to the replication tree under the **MMR** type node of the **Publication Server** node.

**Figure 6-4: Replication tree after adding the master definition node**

The label **MDN** will appear at the end of the node in the replication tree, and the **MDN** field in the Property window will be set to **Yes**, indicating that this is the master definition node.

#### 6.2.3 Adding a Publication
Subordinate to the master definition node, you can create a publication that contains tables from the database.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. Select the **Publication Database** node. From the **Publication** menu, choose **Create Publication**. Alternatively, right-click the **Publication Database** node and select **Create Publication**. The **Create Publication** dialog box will appear.
2. Fill in the following fields under the **Create Publication** tab:
   - **Publication Name**: Enter a unique name for the publication.
   - **Publish**: Check the boxes next to the tables you want to include in the publication. Alternatively, use the **Use Wildcard Selection** button to select tables using wildcard pattern matching.
   - **Select All**: Check this box to include all tables in the **Available Tables** list in the publication.
   - **Use Wildcard Selection**: Click this button to use the wildcard selector to choose tables for the publication. Refer to Section 7.1 for more information on the wildcard selector.

**Figure 6-5: Create Publication dialog box**

If you wish to use table filters during replications between master nodes in this multi-master replication system, follow the directions in the next step to define the initial set of available table filters. Otherwise, proceed to Step 4.

**Step 3 (Optional): Table Filters**
Table filters consist of a set of filter rules that control the selection criteria for rows replicated between master nodes during a snapshot or a synchronization replication.

**Note**: See Section 2.2.12.3 for table setup requirements for a log-based replication system and general restrictions on the use of table filters.

A filter rule consists of a filter name and a SQL WHERE clause (omitting the WHERE keyword) called the filter clause, which you specify for a table to define the selection criteria for rows to be included during replication.

Multiple filter rules may be defined for each table in the publication. If no filter rule is defined for a given table, no filtering can be later enabled on that corresponding table in any master node of the multi-master replication system.

After defining filter rules for a publication table, you can later choose whether to enable those filter rules on any master node in the replication system according to the following rules:
- At most one filter rule can be enabled on a given table in a given master node.
- The same filter rule may be enabled on the same given table in several different master nodes.
- Different filter rules may be enabled on the same given table but in different master nodes.

To define table filters on the publication tables, click the **Table Filters** tab. Select the table from the **Table/View** drop-down list for which you wish to add a filter rule. Click the **Add Filter** button.

In the **Filter** dialog box, enter a descriptive filter name and the filter clause to select the rows you want to replicate. The filter name and filter clause must meet the following conditions:
- For any given table, each filter rule must be assigned a unique filter name.
- For any given table, the filter clauses must have different syntaxes (i.e., the filtering criteria must be different).

**Example**: A filter rule is defined on the `dept` table so only rows where the `deptno` column contains 10, 20, or 30 are included in replications. All other rows are excluded from replication.

**Figure 6-6: Adding a filter rule for the dept table**

**Figure 6-7: Adding a filter rule for the emp table**

Repeating this process, additional filter rules can be added for the `emp` table. The following shows the complete set of available filter rules defined for the `dept` and `emp` tables.

**Figure 6-8: Set of all available filter rules**

To remove a filter rule, highlight the entry and click the **Remove Filter** button. You may also modify the filter name or filter clause of a filter rule listed in the **Table Filters** tab by double-clicking on the cell and entering the desired text.

When creating additional master nodes, you may selectively enable these table filters on the corresponding tables in the additional master nodes. Refer to Section 6.3 for information on creating additional master nodes.

**Note**: To enable table filters on the master definition node under which you are currently creating the publication, you must first switch the role of the master definition node to a different master node (see Section 6.10), and then follow the directions in Section 6.9 to enable the table filters.

This completes the process of defining table filters. The next step is changing conflict resolution options.

If you wish to change the conflict resolution options from their default settings, follow the directions in the next step. Otherwise, proceed to Step 5.

**Step 4 (Optional): Conflict Resolution Options**
If you want to modify or view the current conflict resolution options, click the **Conflict Resolution Options** tab. For each table, you can select the primary conflict resolution strategy and a standby strategy by clicking the appropriate box to expose a drop-down list of choices.

**Figure 6-9: Conflict Resolution Options tab**

During synchronization replication, if conflicting changes are pending against the same row from different master nodes, the conflict resolution strategy determines which of the conflicting changes is accepted and replicated to all master nodes. The conflicting changes that are not accepted are discarded.

If the selection from the **Conflict Resolution Strategy** column does not resolve the conflict, the selection from the **Standby Conflict Resolution Strategy** column is applied. If neither strategy resolves the conflict, the event is marked as **Pending** in the **Conflict History** tab. Refer to Section 6.7 for information on viewing conflict history.

An example of a conflict is when the same column of the same row is changed by transactions in two different master nodes. Depending on the conflict resolution strategy in effect for the table, one of the transactions is accepted and replicated to all master nodes, while the other transaction is discarded and not replicated to any master node.

The following is a brief summary of each conflict resolution strategy:
- **Earliest Timestamp**: The conflicting change with the earliest timestamp is accepted and replicated to all other master nodes. All other conflicting changes are discarded.
- **Latest Timestamp**: The conflicting change with the latest timestamp is accepted and replicated to all other master nodes. All other conflicting changes are discarded.
- **Node Priority**: The conflicting change occurring on the master node with the highest priority level is accepted and replicated to all other master nodes. All other conflicting changes are discarded.
- **Custom**: Update/update conflicts are resolved with a PL/pgSQL custom conflict handling program.
- **Manual**: The conflict remains unresolved. Conflicting changes remain applied in each master node where they originated, but are not replicated to other master nodes. The proper adjustments must be manually applied in each master node.

Refer to Section 6.6.4 for more information on conflict resolution strategies.

**Step 5: REPLICA IDENTITY Option**
If you expect update/update conflicts, set the **REPLICA IDENTITY** option to **FULL** on those tables where the conflicts are expected to occur. Refer to Section 6.6.1 for additional information.

**Step 6: Create the Publication**
Click the **Create** button. If the message **Publication Created Successfully** appears, click **OK**. Otherwise, investigate the error and make the necessary corrections.

**Figure 6-10: Publication created successfully**

Upon successful creation, a **Publication** node will be added to the replication tree.

**Figure 6-11: Replication tree after adding a publication**

### 6.3 Creating Additional Master Nodes
Once you have created the master definition node, you can add additional databases to the multi-master replication system by defining additional master nodes. This is done by creating additional publication database definitions subordinate to the **MMR** type node under the **Publication Server** node that contains the master definition node.

After the publication database definition is created, a **Publication Database** node representing the master node will appear in the replication tree of the xDB Replication Console. The publication that was defined under the master definition node will appear under the **Publication Database** node.

You must enter database connection information such as the database server network address, database identifier, and database login credentials when creating the publication database definition. This information is used by the publication server to access the publication tables during replication.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. Ensure that the database server for the master definition node is running and accepting client connections.
2. Select the **MMR** type node under the same **Publication Server** node that contains the master definition node. From the **Publication** menu, choose **Publication Database**, and then select **Add Database**. Alternatively, right-click the **MMR** type node and choose **Add Database**. The **Publication Service – Add Database** dialog box will appear.
3. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Database Type**: Select either **PostgreSQL** or **Postgres Plus Advanced Server** for the master node. For an Oracle-compatible installation, select **Postgres Plus Advanced Server**. For PostgreSQL or a PostgreSQL-compatible installation, select **PostgreSQL**.
   - **Host**: Enter the IP address of the host where the master node is running.
   - **Port**: Specify the port on which the master node is listening for connections.
   - **User**: Enter the database user name for the master node.
   - **Password**: Provide the password for the database user.
   - **Database**: Enter the database name of the master node.
   - **URL Options (For SSL connectivity)**: Enter the URL options to establish SSL connectivity to the master node. Refer to Section 7.11 for more information on using SSL connections.
   - **Changeset Logging (For Postgres)**: This setting is predetermined by the selection on the master definition node (see Section 6.2.2). **Table Triggers** is for the trigger-based method of synchronization replication, and **WAL Stream** is for the log-based method. Refer to Sections 2.2.9 and 2.2.10 for details on these methods.
   - **Node Priority Level**: Assign a priority level between 1 to 10 for conflict resolution based on node priority. The highest priority is 1, and the lowest is 10. As each additional master node is added, the default priority level number increases, assigning a lower priority level to each additional node.
   - **Replicate Publication Schema**: Check this box if you want the publication server to create the publication table definitions in the new master node by copying the definitions from the master definition node. If you do not check this box, it is assumed that you have already created the table definitions in the master node. If you are using the offline snapshot technique to create this master node, do not check this box. Refer to Section 7.9 for information on using an offline snapshot.
   - **Perform Initial Snapshot**: Check this box if you want the publication server to perform a snapshot from the master definition node to this master node when you click the **Save** button. If you do not check this box, the tables on the master node will not be loaded until you perform a replication at some later time. If you are using the offline snapshot technique to create this master node, you should have already loaded the table rows. Therefore, do not check this box unless you want to reload the data. Refer to Section 7.9 for information on using an offline snapshot.

**Figure 6-12: Publication Service - Add Database dialog box for an additional master node**

**Note**: Unless you intend to use the offline snapshot technique (see Section 7.9), it is suggested that you check the **Perform Initial Snapshot** box. An initial snapshot replication must be performed from the master definition node to every other master node before performing synchronization replications on demand (see Section 6.5.2) or by a schedule (see Section 7.2). If a newly added master node did not undergo an initial snapshot, any subsequent synchronization replication may fail to apply the transactions to that master node. The initial snapshot can also be taken by performing an on-demand snapshot (see Section 6.5.1).

**Step 4: Test the Connection**
Click the **Test** button. If the test result is successful, click **OK**.

**Figure 6-13: Successful master node test**

If an error message appears, investigate the cause of the error, correct the problem, and repeat steps 1 through 4.

**Step 5 (Optional): Enable Table Filters**
If you defined a set of available table filters for the publication, you have the option of enabling these filters on this master node. Refer to Section 6.2.3 for instructions on defining table filters. If you do not wish to filter the rows that are replicated to this master node, proceed to Step 6.

**Note**: Refer to Section 2.2.12.3 for table setup requirements for a log-based replication system and general restrictions on the use of table filters.

Click the **Filter Rules** tab to apply one or more filter rules to the master node. At most one filter rule may be enabled on any given table in the master node.

**Figure 6-14: Enabling filter rules on a master node**

**Step 6: Perform Initial Snapshot**
Check the **Perform Initial Snapshot** box if you want the publication server to perform a snapshot from the master definition node to this master node when you click the **Save** button. If you do not check this box, the tables on the master node will not be loaded until you perform a replication at some later time.

If you are using the offline snapshot technique to create this master node, you should have already loaded the table rows. Therefore, do not check this box unless you want to reload the data. Refer to Section 7.9 for information on using an offline snapshot.
