### Focus on Bitcoin and GARCH Models

Despite the growing diversity of cryptocurrencies, many scholars continue to focus their research on Bitcoin, often employing GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) models to analyze its price time series. For instance, Dyhrberg et al. [13] explore the financial asset capabilities of Bitcoin, suggesting that it should be categorized as a hybrid between gold and the US Dollar, lying on a spectrum from a pure medium of exchange to a pure store of value. Bouoiyour et al. [7] argue that Bitcoin was still in an immature phase at the time of their study, with prices more reactive to negative news than positive. Two years later, Conrad et al. [10] presented contrasting findings, indicating that negative press does not significantly explain Bitcoin's volatility. Dyhrberg [14] further demonstrates that Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against stocks. Katsiampa [21] emphasizes the importance of modeling accuracy and recommends the AR-CGARCH model for price retro-fitting. Bariviera et al. [4] use the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method to compute the Hurst exponent, concluding that market liquidity does not affect the level of long-range dependence. Corbet et al. [11] show that Bitcoin exhibits characteristics of a speculative asset rather than a currency, especially with the introduction of futures trading.

### Financial Characteristics of Other Cryptocurrencies

While the majority of research focuses on Bitcoin, some studies also examine the financial characteristics of other cryptocurrencies. Fry et al. [16] investigate bubbles in the Ripple and Bitcoin markets. Baur et al. [6] explore asymmetric volatility effects in large cryptocurrencies, finding that positive shocks increase volatility more than negative ones. Jahani et al. [19] assess the quality of discussions about cryptocurrencies, discovering a negative correlation between discussion quality and price volatility.

### Pump-and-Dump Schemes in Cryptocurrency Markets

Pump-and-dump schemes are a significant issue in cryptocurrency markets. Kamps et al. [20] develop criteria for detecting suspicious activities such as pump-and-dumps. Hamrick et al. [18] identify success factors for historical pumps using OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) and difference-in-difference methods. Li et al. [23] predict which coins will be pumped using Telegram signals and machine learning models like Random Forest (RF) and Generalized Linear Models (GLM). These studies collectively highlight the detrimental effects of pump-and-dump schemes on the liquidity and price of cryptocurrencies.

### Methodological Approaches and Findings

- **Kamps et al. [20]**: Develop a set of criteria for detecting suspicious activities such as pump-and-dumps.
- **Hamrick et al. [18]**: Use OLS and difference-in-difference methods to identify success factors for historical pumps.
- **Li et al. [23]**: Predict the coin to be pumped using Telegram signals and machine learning models like RF and GLM.

### Conclusions

This paper provides a detailed analysis of pump-and-dump schemes in the cryptocurrency space. We begin by outlining the typical structure of such attacks and then investigate various aspects of real-world attacks over the past eight months on four crypto-exchanges. Our findings reveal the persistent nature of these schemes, which generate millions of dollars in phony trading volumes each month. Market movements prior to a pump-and-dump event often provide clues about which coin will be targeted. Using LASSO regularized GML and balanced random forests, we build models that predict pumped coins based on the timing and venue of pump-and-dump broadcasts in Telegram groups. Out-of-sample tests show that a return of up to 60% over two and a half months can be consistently achieved, even under conservative assumptions. 

We aim to raise awareness of the prevalence of pump-and-dump schemes in the crypto-market and hope our research will lead to fewer victims of market manipulation, more strategic trading, and the adoption of new technologies by regulators to detect and prevent market abuse and criminal behavior.
