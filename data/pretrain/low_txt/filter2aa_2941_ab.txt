## Conclusions (What We Learned in the Past Year)

### Customization of Malware
- **One size fits all is not the mantra of attackers today.**

### Slow and Steady Wins the Race
- **Malware writers are not in for quick and dirty hacks.** Since data is stolen in transit, persistence is key.

### Anti-Forensics
- **Detection is not easy for these new-age malware.** MAC times are modified; random events are configured, and protection from detection is built-in.

### Automation
- **Attackers add layers to malware to automate tasks,** reducing the risk of detection by minimizing their presence in the system.

### Not Slowing Down
- **Since last year's Malware Freakshow at DEF CON 17, techniques have improved significantly.**
