## Abstract
The fourth ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense (MTD) was held in Dallas, Texas, USA, on October 30, 2017, in conjunction with the 24th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). The primary objective of the workshop is to discuss novel randomization, diversification, and dynamism techniques for computer systems and networks, new metrics and analysis frameworks to assess and quantify the effectiveness of MTD, and to explore the challenges and opportunities presented by such defenses. The program includes nine refereed papers and two invited keynote talks, providing participants with a vibrant and thought-provoking set of ideas and insights.

## 1. Introduction
The static nature of current computing systems makes them vulnerable to attacks and difficult to defend. Adversaries have an asymmetric advantage, as they can study a system, identify vulnerabilities, and choose the optimal time and place to attack. The concept of moving-target defense (MTD) aims to impose the same asymmetric disadvantage on attackers by making systems dynamic and thus harder to explore and predict [1, 2]. By constantly changing the system and its attack surface, MTD increases the workload for attackers, leveling the cybersecurity playing field and potentially tilting it in favor of defenders.

The MTD 2017 workshop provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange novel ideas, findings, experiences, and lessons learned in this area.

## 2. Scope
Randomization, diversification, and dynamism can be applied to various components of a computer system or network and across different layers of the software stack [3]. Therefore, MTD encompasses a wide range of techniques, metrics, and analysis frameworks. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Artificial diversity
- Cyber maneuver and agility
- Dynamic network configuration
- Moving target in the cloud
- System diversification techniques
- Dynamic compilation techniques
- Adaptive defenses
- MTD quantification methods and models
- MTD evaluation and assessment frameworks
- MTD analytics
- Moving target in software coding and application API
- Autonomous technologies for MTD
- Human, social, and usability aspects of MTD
- Other related areas
- Theoretical studies on trade-offs of MTD approaches
- Large-scale MTD (using multiple techniques)

## 3. Workshop Objectives
This workshop brings together researchers from academia, government, and industry to report on the latest research efforts in MTD and to engage in productive discussions and constructive debates. The fourth MTD workshop will also focus on the lessons learned from past years of research, and the challenges and opportunities faced by the community moving forward.

## 4. MTD Program
The fourth MTD workshop is a one-day pre-conference event held in conjunction with the ACM CCS conference. We have two invited keynote speakers:
- Prof. Paul Van Oorschot (Carleton University, Canada) will discuss the science of security and what can be learned from the history of academic literature.
- Prof. Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi (Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany) will talk about the effectiveness of system randomization.

The program also includes nine refereed full papers and two short papers, covering a broad range of topics from code/network/policy/web randomization techniques to metrics and analysis frameworks, and botnet detection. Presentations will be grouped by topic.
