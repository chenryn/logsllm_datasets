# Attacking Skinny Services

## Overview
- **Cisco Skinny (SCCP)**
  - Uses binary, not plain text.
  - Multiple versions exist.
  - No built-in authentication.
  - MAC address is used as the identity.
  - Supports auto-registration.

## Basic Attacks
- **Register as a phone**: Impersonate a legitimate phone.
- **Disconnect other phones**: Force other phones to disconnect.
- **Call forwarding**: Redirect calls to unauthorized numbers.
- **Unauthorized calls**: Make calls without proper authorization.

---

# Viproy Skinny Library
- **Viproy** provides a Skinny library for easier development and sample attack modules.
  - **Skinny auto registration**
  - **Skinny register**
  - **Skinny call**
  - **Skinny call forwarding**

---

# Preparing a Proper Client for Skinny
- **Install Cisco IP Communicator**
- **Change the MAC address of Windows**
- **Register the software with the modified MAC address**

# VOSS Self Care
- **Tenant User Services:**
  - Password & PIN management
  - Voicemail configuration
  - Presence
  - Corporate Directory access
  - Extension mobility

- **Weaknesses:**
  - Privilege escalation vulnerabilities
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities

---

# Account Details Stored XSS

---

# VOSS Administration
- **Tenant Administration Services:**
  - User management
  - Location and dial plan management
  - CLI and number translation configuration

- **Weaknesses:**
  - User enumeration
  - Privilege escalation vulnerabilities
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
  - SQL injection and SOAP manipulation

---

# Errors and Information Leakage
- `/emapp/EMAppServlet?device=USER`
- `/bvsm/iptusermgt/disassociateuser.cgi`

---

# Insecure File Upload
- `/bvsm/iptbulkadmin`
- `/bvsm/iptbulkloadmgt/bulkloaduploadform.cgi`

---

# Privilege Escalation
- `/bvsm/iptusermgt/moduser.cgi` (stored XSS, change users’ role)
- `/bvsm/iptadminusermgt/adduserform.cgi?user_type=adminuser`
- `/bvsm/iptnumtransmgt/editnumbertranslationform.cgi?id=1`

---

# IP Phone Management
- **VOSS IP Phone XML Services:**
  - Shared service for all tenants
  - Call forwarding (available in Skinny, not in SIP)
  - Speed dial management
  - Voicemail PIN management

- **Services:**
  - `speeddials`
  - `changepinform`
  - `showcallfwd`
  - `callfwdmenu`

- **Actions:**
  - `CallForwardAll`
  - `CallForwardBusy`

- **Weaknesses:**
  - Authentication and authorization are free.
  - MAC address is sufficient for identification.
  - Jailbreaking tenant services is possible.

- **Viproy Modules:**
  - Call Forwarding
  - Speed Dial

# VoIP Client Security
- **Client Types:**
  - Mobile
  - Desktop
  - Teleconference
  - Handsets

- **Security Issues:**
  - Information disclosure
  - Unnecessary services and ports (e.g., SNMP, FTP)
  - Weak management services (e.g., Telnet, SSH, HTTP)
  - Stored credentials and sensitive information
  - Unauthorized access (e.g., password or TFTP attacks, enforced upgrades)
  - Weak VoIP services (e.g., clients may accept direct invite, register, or notify)

---

# Cisco VoIP Clients
- **Clients:**
  - Cisco IP Phones
  - Cisco IP Communicator
  - Cisco Unified Personal Communicator
  - Cisco Webex Client
  - Cisco Jabber services
  - Cisco Jabber Voice/Video
  - IM for 3rd party clients
  - Mobile, desktop, Mac
  - Jabber SDK for web

---

# Rogue Services and DSITM
- **Techniques:**
  - ARP/DNS spoofing
  - VLAN hopping
  - Manual configuration
  - Credential and hash collection
  - Feature addition via client request modification
  - SDP feature redirection
  - Proxy header addition to bypass billing and CDR
  - Runtime request manipulation to find buffer overflow (BoF) vulnerabilities
  - Software upgrade triggers for malware

---

# Attacking a Client Using SIP Service
- **Attacks:**
  - Caller ID spoofing to install malicious applications or SSL certificates
  - Voicemail or call redirection
  - Fake caller ID for scam, vishing, or spying
  - Content or content-type manipulation on messaging
  - Remote client crash or BoF triggering
  - Cross-site scripting injection into conversations

- **Proxies:**
  - TLS+TCP interception and manipulation
  - Em-proxy (github.com/fozavci/em-proxy)
  - MITMproxy

---

# Traffic Manipulation as DSITM
- **Video Demonstration:**
  - Custom protocol attacks
  - Forced upgrades
  - Initiate a call
  - Call VoIP extension/plugin through browser using HTML

---

# Attacking a Client Using SIP Trust
- **SIP Server Redirection:**
  - Fields redirected to the client: FROM, FROM NAME, Contact
  - Other fields depend on the server (e.g., SDP, MIME)
  - Message content
  - Buffer overflow in FROM field (test with 2000 characters)
  - Crashing or executing shellcode if available
  - Clients trust SIP servers, and trust is UDP-based

- **Viproy Penetration Testing Kit SIP Modules:**
  - Simple fuzz support (FROM=FUZZ 2000)
  - Modifiable for further attacks

---

# Video Demonstration
- **SIP-Based Client Attacks:**
  - Instant messaging manipulation
  - Initiating a call with a fake Caller ID
  - Sending a fake message from the operator
  - Sending a bogus message to crash the client
  - Overloading the client with too many calls

---

# Solutions
- **Install Cisco security patches:**
  - From CVE-2014-3277 to CVE-2014-3283
  - Specific patch IDs: CSCum75078, CSCun17309, CSCum77041, CSCuo51517, CSCum76930, CSCun49862

- **Secure Network Design:**
  - Dedicated IP phone services
  - Secure deployment with PKI
  - Authentication with X.509 and software signatures
  - Secure SSL configuration
  - Use of secure protocols (e.g., Skinny authentication, SIP authentication)
  - Prefer HTTP over TFTP and SSH over Telnet
