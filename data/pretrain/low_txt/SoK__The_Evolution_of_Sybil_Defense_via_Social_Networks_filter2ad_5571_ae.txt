### Evaluating ACL: Expanding Social Defense Guarantees

**Objective:**
Our primary goal in evaluating Access Control Lists (ACL) is to determine whether it enhances the guarantees provided by current social defense systems in two key areas:
1. **Resilience to Denser Attacks:** Assessing how well ACL can withstand attacks with a higher density of malicious edges.
2. **High-Quality Sybil Defense:** Ensuring that ACL provides robust protection against Sybil attacks without relying on the assumption that the entire graph is fast-mixing, thereby avoiding the need for preprocessing.

**Method and Environment:**
Viswanath et al. [39] observed that, despite their unique characteristics, sybil defense schemes are fundamentally based on community detection and produce highly correlated results. For clarity, our experiments compare ACL only with SybilLimit, which we consider as the benchmark among similar algorithms. Although SybilLimit outperformed its peers, our tests with SybilGuard, SybilInfer, and Gatekeeper yielded qualitatively similar outcomes.

**Graph Generation and Experiment Setup:**
We generate graphs by subjecting social networks, assumed to contain only honest nodes, to the attack described in Section II-B. We then run ACL and SybilLimit on these attacked graphs, rank the nodes using the methodology discussed in Section III, and measure precision (the percentage of nodes in the prefix that are honest) and recall (the percentage of honest nodes in the prefix) from the perspective of 10 randomly chosen seeds. The reported values are the average of these measurements.

**Configuration:**
- **SybilLimit:** Configured with 1.5√m random walks of length 1.5 log(n).
- **ACL:** Configured with α = 10^-3 and ɛ sufficiently small to label every node in the attacked graph with non-zero weight. For DBLP, ɛ = 10^-7; for other graphs, ɛ = 10^-6 suffices.

**Results:**

**ACL Tolerates Denser Attacks:**
Figure 6 illustrates the performance of ACL and SybilLimit in defending the Facebook graph against varying attack strengths, measured as the percentage p of attack edges in the graph, ranging from p = 0.01 to p = 0.1. ACL's ability to correctly classify nodes degrades gracefully as the attack strength increases, maintaining relatively high accuracy even at p = 0.1. In contrast, SybilLimit's performance deteriorates rapidly with increasing attack strength.

**ACL Does Not Require Preprocessing:**
Figure 7 compares the protection offered by ACL and SybilLimit on the Facebook, DBLP, Epinions, and WikiTalk graphs under an attack with p = 0.01. ACL achieves high precision at high recall without preprocessing. SybilLimit's performance varies: it provides excellent protection on preprocessed graphs but shows degradation on raw graphs, especially for DBLP.

**Second Attack Model:**
We also evaluate the algorithms using a widely used attack model [10], [42]. Here, the number of attack edges g is fixed, and random honest nodes are declared sybils until g attack edges are obtained. Additional sybil nodes are created to reach a total of γ sybils, connected via a scale-free topology. Figure 8 shows that ACL and Mislove outperform other algorithms (Gatekeeper, SybilLimit, and SybilGuard) on the Facebook graph with g = 50,000 and γ = 10,000. Similar results were observed on other graphs.

**Local vs. Global Detection:**
While ACL is effective in practice, building a universal sybil defense system for community-structured networks remains an open problem. Cao et al. [7] propose expanding defensive coverage by using multiple trusted seed nodes. This approach, while promising, does not immediately provide strong theoretical guarantees, especially for seeds near the boundary between honest and sybil regions. Despite these challenges, the results from Cao et al. [7] in real-world scenarios are encouraging, suggesting a promising research direction.
