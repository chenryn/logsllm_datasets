## Abstract
The Code Red worm incident in July 2001 has spurred efforts to model and analyze the propagation of Internet worms. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the Code Red worm's propagation, taking into account two key factors: dynamic countermeasures taken by ISPs and users, and the reduced infection rate due to network congestion and router issues caused by the worm's rampant spread. Based on the classical Kermack-McKendrick epidemic model, we develop a new model called the two-factor worm model. Simulations and numerical solutions from this model match the observed data of the Code Red worm more accurately than previous models. This model enhances our understanding and predictive capabilities regarding the scale and speed of Internet worm propagation.

## 1. Introduction
The widespread use and easy access to the Internet make it a prime target for malicious activities. In particular, the Internet has become a powerful medium for propagating malicious software, such as worms. These autonomous programs spread through computer networks by automatically searching, attacking, and infecting remote computers. The first notable worm, the Morris worm, appeared over 10 years ago [30]. Today, our computing infrastructure is more vulnerable than ever [28]. The Code Red and Nimda worm incidents in 2001 highlighted the vulnerability of our networks and the rapid spread of virulent worms. Weaver also proposed design principles that could make worms spread even faster [34].

To defend against future worms, it is essential to understand their behavior, including the propagation pattern during their lifetime, the impact of patching and awareness, and the influence of network traffic and topology. An accurate model of Internet worm propagation can provide insights into worm behavior, identify weaknesses in the spreading chain, and offer accurate predictions for damage assessment.

In epidemiology, several deterministic and stochastic models exist for virus spreading [1, 2, 3, 15], but few models are available for Internet worm propagation. Kephart, White, and Chess at IBM conducted studies from 1991 to 1993, extending traditional epidemic models to non-homogeneous networks [20, 21, 22]. However, these models, which assume local interactions and the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, are not suitable for today's Internet worms, which propagate globally and can directly target hosts.

Wang et al. [32] presented simulation results of virus propagation on clustered and tree-like hierarchical networks, showing that selective immunization can slow down virus propagation. However, their conclusions were based on a tree-like hierarchical topology, which is not representative of the Internet.

Staniford et al. [31] used the classical simple epidemic equation to model the Code Red worm right after the July 19th incident, and their model matched well with limited observed data. Heberlein [17] provided a visual simulation of Code Red propagation, and Moore [27] offered valuable observed data and a detailed analysis. Weaver [34] proposed design principles for faster-spreading worms.

Previous work on worm modeling has often neglected the dynamic effects of human countermeasures. Wang et al. [32] considered only static immunization, where a fraction of hosts are immunized before the worm spreads. In reality, human countermeasures, such as using antivirus software, patching, setting up filters, and disconnecting networks, play a crucial role in slowing down worm propagation.

In this paper, we analyze the Code Red incident of July 19th, 2001, and find that two factors affected its propagation: dynamic countermeasures and the slowed-down infection rate due to network congestion. By incorporating these factors, we derive a more accurate model: the two-factor worm model. Our simulations and numerical solutions show that this model matches the observed Code Red data well, explaining the decrease in scan attempts and the lower infection rate compared to previous models.

## 2. Background on the Code Red Worm
On June 18th, 2001, a serious Windows IIS vulnerability was discovered [24]. The first version of the Code Red worm, exploiting this vulnerability, emerged on July 13th, 2001 [11]. Due to a coding error in its random number generator, it did not propagate effectively [23]. The more virulent strain, Code Red version 2, began spreading around 10:00 UTC on July 19th [27]. This version implemented a correct random number generator and generated 100 threads. Each of the first 99 threads randomly chose an IP address and attempted to connect to port 80. If successful, the worm sent a copy of itself to the victim web server. The 100th thread defaced the infected system’s website if it was an English Windows 2000 system; otherwise, it also attempted to infect other systems.

Code Red uniformly scanned the IP address space, targeting Windows 2000 systems with IIS servers. Microsoft estimated there were 6 million Windows IIS web servers at the time [19]. Assuming fewer than 2 million IIS servers were online, each worm would need to perform more than 2000 IP scans to find a target. The worm continued to spread until 0:00 UTC on July 20th, when it stopped by design [4].

Three independent data sets are available for the Code Red incident. Goldsmith and Eichman collected data on two Class B networks, recording the number of Code Red port 80 scans and the number of unique sources generating these scans per hour. The data, shown in Figure 1, exhibit similar patterns due to the uniform scanning of the worm.

Since Code Red scanned random IP addresses, the data from these two networks accurately represent the overall propagation pattern. Both the number of unique sources and the number of scans increased proportionally, indicating the growth of active infected computers on the Internet.

## 3. Classical Epidemic Models and Their Limitations
Classical epidemic models, such as the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) and SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) models, have been used to study the spread of diseases. These models assume homogeneous mixing and constant infection rates, which are not suitable for Internet worm propagation. For example, the SIS model assumes that a cured host can be reinfected immediately, which is not realistic for a single worm.

## 4. The Two-Factor Worm Model
We introduce the two-factor worm model, which accounts for the dynamic countermeasures and the variable infection rate. Dynamic countermeasures include actions like patching, using antivirus software, and setting up filters. The infection rate is not constant but varies due to network congestion and the effectiveness of countermeasures.

### 4.1 Model Description
The two-factor worm model extends the classical Kermack-McKendrick model by incorporating the following:
- **Dynamic Countermeasures**: The rate at which hosts are patched or cleaned.
- **Variable Infection Rate**: The rate at which the worm infects new hosts, which decreases as the network becomes congested.

### 4.2 Mathematical Formulation
We derive a set of differential equations to describe the behavior of the two-factor worm model. Let \( S(t) \) be the number of susceptible hosts, \( I(t) \) the number of infected hosts, and \( R(t) \) the number of recovered (patched or cleaned) hosts at time \( t \). The model is given by:

\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta(t) S I
\]

\[
\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta(t) S I - \gamma I
\]

\[
\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I
\]

where:
- \(\beta(t)\) is the time-varying infection rate.
- \(\gamma\) is the recovery rate, representing the rate at which infected hosts are patched or cleaned.

## 5. Simulations and Numerical Solutions
We simulate the two-factor worm model and compare the results with the observed Code Red data. The simulations and numerical solutions show a good match, particularly in explaining the decrease in scan attempts and the lower infection rate.

## 6. Conclusion
This paper presents a new model, the two-factor worm model, which incorporates dynamic countermeasures and a variable infection rate. The model provides a more accurate representation of the Code Red worm's propagation, offering better predictions and insights into the behavior of Internet worms. Future work will focus on extending the model to other types of worms and further validating the model with additional data.
