**Open Questions and Future Work**

The open questions identified in this work are expected to inspire further research from both theoreticians and practitioners, helping to break the impasse in data sharing.

**Data/Code Release and Ethics**

While we have highlighted privacy concerns associated with GAN-based models, the code and data we are releasing do not raise any ethical issues. The public datasets used do not contain any personal information.
