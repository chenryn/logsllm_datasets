### VIII. CONCLUSION

Mutual authentication is a central and key security objective in LTE, serving as the foundation for authorization, accounting, and lawful interception. In LTE, a provably secure Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol establishes mutual authentication, and subsequent security mechanisms ensure data confidentiality. However, recent studies have revealed that these security mechanisms do not protect against the manipulation of user data.

In this paper, we introduce the novel IMP4GT attacks, which completely undermine the mutual authentication goal on the user plane. Specifically, IMP4GT enables an active radio attacker to establish arbitrary TCP/IP connections to and from the Internet through the victim’s User Equipment (UE). The attack exploits the lack of integrity protection combined with ICMP reflection mechanisms. As a result, the attacker can bypass any authorization, accounting, or firewall mechanisms implemented by the provider. We conducted experiments to verify our assumptions and demonstrate the real-world feasibility of IMP4GT in a realistic setup. Our results show that we can access a service site that should only be accessible by the user or circumvent the provider’s firewall. The absence of integrity protection can break mutual authentication, which is a fundamental security aim of LTE. Given this, we call for the specification of effective countermeasures for LTE and mandatory user-plane integrity protection for 5G.
