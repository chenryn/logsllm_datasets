### Analysis of Private Messaging Events

We analyzed the distribution of private messaging events among users and their associates. Specifically, we examined the 60%, 70%, and 80% points in this distribution. Figure 5 indicates that users on LC (the underground forum) exchange private messages with a diverse set of individuals, unlike users on traditional online social networks (OSNs), who tend to interact with only a few of their friends. For example, Wilson et al. [11] found that for Facebook users, 20% of their friends account for 70% of their interactions. In contrast, for users on LC, approximately 70% of their associates are responsible for 70% of their private messages. The corresponding graph for users linked via threads shows a similar pattern.

### Marketplace Analysis

In this section, we examine the types of goods and services exchanged on LC and CC, the two forums with the most well-developed and active trading marketplaces. We first look at the types of goods traded within these underground communities and then analyze how social degree and reputation influence trading activities.

#### 5.1 Merchandise

To determine the types of items available on the forums, we extracted thread titles containing the markers "[B]" or "[S]", denoting items being bought or sold, respectively. We then created over 500 regular expressions to categorize the items into 18 categories, including merchandise, banking information, drugs, mailing and dropping services, and other commonly observed wares/services. These categories were based on domain knowledge of illicit goods and random sampling of trading thread titles. Using our regular expressions, we categorized 87% of the 14,430 CC threads and 77% of the 31,923 LC threads. Since users often list multiple items for trade in a single thread, a thread may be counted in multiple categories. There is a long tail of merchandise types that we did not cover, such as "Internet hack N95" or "Proteine - Inko X-TREME Muscle Gainer" on LC, and "Conrad.de Kundenlogins" or "Pall Mall umsonst" on CC.

Tables 5 and 6 show the top 10 most commonly traded items on CC and LC, respectively, ordered by the number of total binned threads in each category. The "Thread" column shows the number of thread titles containing terms associated with the category, while the "User" column shows the number of distinct users who created those threads. The "B" and "S" columns denote threads where items were being bought or sold, respectively.

The most commonly traded items are offline/online payments, including PayPal, cash, Ukash, and PaySafeCards (PSC). Over 5% of all threads involve trading for offline/online payments on both forums. PSC, a type of prepaid online currency widely used in Europe, is particularly popular. Gaming accounts, especially Steam, are the second most commonly traded item, followed by credit cards and accounts. Drugs also make up a notable number of traded items on CC, with over 100 threads listing weed, 25 mentioning Viagra, and 15 specifying speed.

#### 5.2 Top Traders and Market Activity

Next, we examined the number of trading threads created by the top merchants. Figure 6 illustrates the relationship between the top percentile of traders on both forums and the percentage of goods traded. For example, the top 10% of traders on both sites (measured by the number of trading threads created) account for 40-50% of the goods traded. This suggests that law enforcement can target the top tier traders to significantly disrupt marketplace activity. However, top traders can create multiple accounts to mask their activity levels, making it nontrivial to accumulate reputation across multiple accounts.

#### 5.3 Social Degree and Trading

We analyzed the effect of the social network on trading. Figure 7 shows how the median social degree, measured in private message links, increases for users after posting trading threads on LC. We ordered each user's trading threads by time and computed the user's PM social degree just before creating each thread. We then binned that social degree with respect to the thread's posting order, taking the median over all users. The results suggest that as users trade more, they interact with increasingly larger numbers of individuals, potentially expanding their customer base. For LC, the median out and in degrees for the PM social graphs increase at a roughly constant rate of four for every trading thread created. The CC graph shows a similar trend, with the PM out/in degree increasing at a rate between one and two for each thread.

We also investigated how PM in/out degree affects the response to a trading thread. Figure 8 plots the in/out PM degrees for LC users before they post a trading thread against the number of PMs they receive in the following week. On average, LC and CC members receive 0.07 (σ = 0.68) and 0.11 (σ = 1.19) private messages per week when issuing no posts prior to that week. The graph suggests that traders with higher PM social graph degrees receive more PMs in the week after they post a trading thread. For CC, the numbers look similar but become increasingly noisy after an in/out degree of 30.

Finally, we looked at the fraction of private messages sent by new users to traders in the week following a trading thread post. Figure 9 shows that for approximately 30% of all trading threads, the posters receive only PMs from individuals they have interacted with before. For 50% of the trading threads on LC and CC, 60-75% of the PMs came from prior acquaintances. For approximately 20-25% of all trading threads, the trader interacted with only new people.

#### 5.4 Effect of Group Status

Figure 10 shows how a user's group status influences the responsiveness to a trading thread. We focused on CC because LC does not contain data regarding user group transitions. We examined the trading threads posted by users at different group levels and determined how many PMs the users received in the week after posting. The figure suggests that a user's group status significantly affects the number of PMs received. Verified vendors and VIP members receive 2-3 times more response PMs than "newbies."

#### 5.5 Effect of Ratings

CC is the only forum with an explicit rating system for trading transactions, which is ternary: positive, negative, or neutral. Surprisingly, most reviews are positive: of the 3,157 reviews (20% of discernible trading threads), only 67 were negative and 2 were neutral. Of the 67 negatively rated users, 43 were banned, and the rest were generally rated negatively due to "poor" or "unfriendly" service. We suspect that bad traders are publicly outed in separate thread posts and banned before being rated. Because so few users were rated poorly, we do not differentiate between the rating types.

We considered the effect of the rating system on the interest a trader receives (in the form of response posts or private messages) after posting a trading thread. Figure 11 shows the effects of the first 10 ratings on the median number of PMs users receive in the week following a trading thread post. With zero ratings, the median response PM count is one, but with a single rating, the median count rises to 15. The median PM count continues to increase, though not in a well-defined manner. While rated traders receive more private messages, they do not experience an increase in the number of response posts; the median response post count remains constant at one. We speculate that the rating system lends more credibility to a trader's threads, and people are less likely to question the trader's reputation in the public space.

#### 5.6 Activity to First Rating

We analyzed how much activity users must participate in before they earn enough trust to engage in a business transaction with another forum member. We measured the number of actions users take (postings, private messaging) before they receive their first ratings. Relying on the rating system is subject to error, as users can conduct business outside the forum, but it provides some insight into how trust is earned. Figure 12 shows that before approximately 50% of users received their first ratings, they posted around 60 times in 50 different threads, received about 35 private messages from 13 users, and sent around 33 private messages to 13 users.

### Banned User Analysis

Some users in underground forums behave maliciously towards other members. In this section, we examine the top reasons why users are banned from the forums and investigate different properties associated with accusations of fraud in the marketplace.
