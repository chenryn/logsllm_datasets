## Abstract
Home computer users are often considered the weakest link in computer security. They frequently ignore security advice and engage in risky behaviors, such as falling for phishing scams. The reasons behind these behaviors are not well understood. This paper reviews the literature on factors influencing security decisions among home computer users. We organize our review into four sections: understanding of threats, perceptions of risky behavior, efforts to avoid security breaches, and attitudes toward security interventions. Our findings highlight several reasons why current security measures may not meet the needs or abilities of home computer users and suggest areas for future research to improve security practices.

**Keywords:** Usability and security, home users

## I. Introduction: Why Study the Home Computer User?
Home computer users are often seen as the weakest link in computer security. Threats such as web cookies and phishing require user complicity or acquiescence. Adequate security is not inherent with the purchase of a computer; it requires additional software, careful settings, strong passwords, and regular updates. As more sensitive tasks and private data are managed online, home users face increasing security challenges. Surveys and studies indicate that many home users do not fully understand the threats, nor do they have the time, desire, or knowledge to manage them effectively. Even systems administrators can be lax in applying security patches. Despite being frequent targets of attacks and a significant market for security software, there is limited understanding of how home users perceive and address security and privacy threats.

## II. The Home Computer User
### A. Demographics and Characteristics
The home computer user is a diverse and large group, ranging from adults performing household tasks to college students. Gartner estimates that 2 billion personal computers will be in use by 2014. For this study, we define home users as non-professionals who use computers for various tasks but lack formal training. We focus on users in the home environment, excluding those with access to IT professionals through their employers.

#### 1. Demographic Studies
- **Solic and Ilakovac (2011):** Surveyed 39 university faculty members from electrical engineering and medical schools to assess their security attitudes.
- **Friedman et al. (2011):** Conducted semi-structured interviews with 72 adults from rural, suburban, and high-technology communities to identify their concerns about web security.
- **Diesner et al. (2011):** Surveyed educated users in India due to the country's growing role in global data centers.
- **Aytes and Connolly (2004):** Surveyed undergraduates at two U.S. universities to assess their knowledge of risks and security actions.

#### 2. Common Findings
- **Gender and Education:** Some studies found that women were less likely to rate themselves as advanced users, while men and college graduates were more likely to engage in risky online behaviors.
- **Socioeconomic Factors:** Participants in one study believed that only wealthy people are targeted by security threats.
- **Age:** Older adults perceived lower risk from data confidentiality threats compared to younger adults.
- **Computer Use:** Common activities include web browsing, email, shopping, and banking. Many users share computers with family members, complicating security management.

### B. Sources of Information
Home users often rely on public information websites, IT professionals, friends, and relatives for security advice. Undergraduates in one study reported high levels of self-perceived knowledge but relied primarily on friends and personal experience rather than formal training. Government and commercial entities have created educational websites, but their recognition and usage remain low.

## III. Predictive Models
Several studies have developed predictive models of security and privacy behaviors based on social cognitive theories. Two prominent models are:

- **Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB):** Focuses on the influence of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control.
- **Protection Motivation Theory (PMT):** Emphasizes the role of threat appraisal and coping appraisal in motivating protective behaviors.

These models help in understanding and predicting the security behaviors of home computer users.

## IV. Conclusion
This review highlights the gaps in our understanding of home computer users' security behaviors. Future research should focus on developing more effective security interventions that align with users' needs and abilities. By better understanding the factors that influence home users' security decisions, we can create more usable and effective security measures.
