### Automatic and Manual Classification of Domains

**Automatic Classification (Top) and Manual Classification (Bottom)**
- **Sample Size**: 485 domains
- **Exclusion**: 6.2% of .biz domains without a corresponding .com namesake
- **Confidence Indicators**: Darker bands indicate higher confidence

### Defensive Registrations

Defensive registrations are used to prevent other parties from:
- Misrepresenting themselves as the registrant.
- Capturing traffic intended for the registrant for advertising purposes.

A defensively registered domain is not used by the registrant to name and identify products, services, or network infrastructure.

### Determining Primary or Defensive Use

While it is nearly impossible to determine the registrant's intention with absolute certainty, certain network-visible characteristics can serve as indicators:
- **Domain Ownership**
- **Web Content**
- **Hosting Infrastructure Sharing**

Our findings are summarized in Figure 1.

### 4.1 Parked Domains

A parked domain is one that is not actively used by the registrant and does not represent a name or brand used by the registrant. Registrants typically hold parked domains with the intention of selling them at a profit or monetizing accidental web traffic through advertising. Parked domains are easily identified by prominent advertising on the domain’s site, often including options to purchase the domain and additional advertisements.

**Primary Indicator**: Web content hosted at the domain.
- **Table 1**: Proportion of parked sites in the .biz and .com gTLDs.
- **Figure 1**: Number of parked .biz domains (23.6%) having a .com namesake.

### 4.2 Identical Web Content

Owners of defensively registered domains frequently reroute all web traffic to the intended (primary) domain, usually via HTTP redirection. This method changes the user-visible address bar to reflect the new address, ensuring consistency with the branding of the site.

**Table 1**: 
- 18.5% of .biz and 17.3% of .com domains host a web server that redirects the user.
- 4.1% of .biz sites redirect to a site hosted at the same domain name in a different TLD, compared to 0.4% for .com.
- 6.1% of .biz and .com domains have identical redirects.

**Content Comparison**:
- 3.0% of non-parked sites served the same content.
- Pages are classified as identical if the source matches exactly, indicating a defensive registration.
- **Figure 1**: 12.8% of .biz–.com domains have identical web content or redirects, a strong indicator of a defensive registration. 12.9% have different web content and no stronger classifiers, weakly classified as primary registrations.

### 4.3 Common Registrant

The identity of the registrant provides another classification feature. If the same registrant owns both a .biz domain and its .com namesake, it likely suggests a defensive registration.

**Whois Records**:
- We could retrieve and successfully parse both Whois records for 65% of all .biz–.com pairs.
- 10.1% of .biz domains and 9.3% of .com domains showed some manner of "privacy protection" mechanism.
- **Table 2**: Comparison of registrants using Whois records, showing absolute and relative numbers of .biz–.com name pairs in each category.

**Classification**:
- 5.9% of pairs were strong matches.
- 15.6% were weak matches.
- 29.1% were unlikely to be the same registrant.
- **Figure 1**: Whois data is considered more reliable than common hosting or different web content but less reliable than HTTP redirects and identical web content.

### 4.4 Shared Infrastructure

We used DNS crawling to observe infrastructure sharing between a .biz domain and its .com counterpart, using CNAMEs and common A records as evidence of defensive registrations.

**CNAME Matches**:
- 1.6% of .biz and .com domains show common CNAMEs.
- **Figure 1**: These are included in the "redirect match" category.

**Common A Records**:
- 22% of .biz and .com domains have common A records.
- **Plausible Explanations**:
  - Defensive registrations.
  - Coincidental common hosting.
  - Parking the .biz and .com domains in the same parking infrastructure.
- **Figure 1**: Common A records are considered weak evidence of a defensive registration.

### 5. Discussion

**Findings**:
- 22.8% of .biz domains are parked with a known parking service.
- 12.8% of .biz domains are classified as defensive registrations.
- 27.7% of .biz domains served some kind of content (excluding cases where this content proved identical to the .com namesake).
- 40% of .biz and .com pairs had at least a degree of match in registrant information, indicating a substantial level of defensive registrations.

**Popularity**:
- **Table 3**: TLD frequency in the Alexa listings and the Open Directory Project.
- The .biz TLD occurs 140 times less frequently than .com in the Alexa 1 million, 323 times less frequently in the Alexa 500, and 218 times less frequently in the Open Directory Project.
- These statistics suggest a disproportionately lower popularity of .biz compared to .com.

### 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we examined the current state of the .biz TLD on its ten-year anniversary. We found that in many respects, .biz resembles .com, particularly in the prevalence of domain speculation (parking). While .biz has not rivaled .com, it has extracted defensive registrations from existing domain owners. The cost of registering these domains is dwarfed by the additional costs of defending trademarks in a new TLD.

As ICANN prepares to open TLD registration to the general public, .biz provides a valuable lesson in the costs and benefits associated with expanding the DNS name space. We anticipate a significant level of defensive registrations, which will impose substantial expenditures.
