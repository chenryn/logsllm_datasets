## Abstract
Recent Advances in the Dependability Assessment of Complex Systems (RADIANCE) is a workshop aimed at discussing novel dependability assessment approaches for complex systems and promoting their adoption in real-world settings through industrial and academic research. The main objective is to foster discussion on innovative ideas, providing a forum where researchers can share both real problems and solutions for the assessment of complex systems.

## I. Motivation and Goals
Critical systems are becoming increasingly complex and heterogeneous, integrating previously separated systems and incorporating design solutions such as the introduction of software Off-The-Shelf (OTS) components and the adoption of loosely-integrated and composable services. This calls for innovative dependability assessment and certification processes to handle such complexity, necessitating efficient, automated, and continuous assessment and certification methods.

The first edition of the RADIANCE workshop aims to discuss and promote novel dependability assessment approaches for complex systems. The workshop focuses on assessing evolving systems, where increasing complexity and changes are due to the introduction of new components, sensors, and extensive usage of OTS or black box components. It covers a broad range of applications, including agile development in critical systems, model-driven assessment approaches, and the verification, validation, and certification of dynamic and evolving systems. Additionally, the workshop is interested in experimental assessments of dependability and security.

We believe that the goals of RADIANCE align with the main trends in the evolution of critical systems, which are shifting from small, closed networks to broad, open, and potentially loosely-integrated System of Systems. These goals also align with recent research trends in the community of dependable and secure systems, making them relevant to the main topics of the DSN.

## II. Contributions
The Program Committee (PC) consists of 23 researchers from around the globe, including experienced representatives from the sponsoring projects. The committee includes a mix of academics and industry professionals, ensuring a diverse and high-quality review process.

RADIANCE attracted 14 submissions from both industry and academia, meeting our expectations for the first edition. Six submissions came from outside the supporting projects. Each paper received at least three reviews, ensuring a rigorous selection process. Papers were evaluated based on their scientific impact, industrial applicability, novelty, and their potential to promote interesting discussions.

Ten papers were accepted for presentation at the workshop. We are confident that these papers will foster discussions on novel ideas and facilitate knowledge transfer among participants.

## III. Program

### A. Keynote Presentation
The workshop will begin with an invited keynote by Bradley Schmerl, a Senior Systems Scientist at the Institute for Software Research, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. His presentation, titled "Challenges in Engineering Dependable Self-Adaptive Systems," will cover his group's work on making self-adaptive systems more dependable. This includes probabilistic model checking, stochastic games, models for specifying context and impact of adaptation, and the involvement of human operators in the adaptation process.

Self-adaptive systems, being inherently dynamic and evolving, pose unique challenges in dependability assessment. This presentation will set the stage for insightful discussions throughout the workshop.

### B. Paper Discussion Sessions
The workshop will feature presentations and discussions of the accepted papers. Emphasis will be placed on the discussion phase, especially for novel techniques, even if preliminary.

The accepted papers cover four macro areas:
1. **Security and Dependability Analysis**: Papers using analysis techniques to quantify the impact of security attacks and dependability issues.
2. **Agile Development and Natural Language Requirements**: Papers automating and improving development processes dependent on natural language documentation.
3. **Safety Assessment in Industrial Systems**: Papers discussing safety assessment challenges faced by the industry, such as cost estimation and process improvement.
4. **Fault Injection for Complex Systems**: Papers applying fault injection techniques to complex systems like SOAs, OTS, and for failure prediction.

Grouping these papers into sessions allows for focused discussions. Wrap-up discussions at the end of each session will recapitulate common points, raise challenges, and provide more room for discussion.
