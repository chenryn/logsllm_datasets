### Introduction

Both Bro and Suricata enable users to compare new queries with previous traffic. We implemented our detection mechanism in both Bro and Suricata, and observed slight differences between the two. In earlier versions of Suricata (prior to version 2.1), users were unable to use the Suricata library to extract flow information. Additionally, there were limited examples and documentation available for creating Suricata scripts and explaining the functions within each library. In contrast, Bro provides more sample scripts and libraries for extracting packet information, and its online documentation is well-organized and maintained.

### Experimental Setup

We tested our Bro and Suricata solutions in a test environment (Fig. 7). The experiment involved launching DNS reverse reconnaissance attacks from an attacker (IP: 2001:0df:0000:2005:0a00:27ff:fe0e:662d) by sending sequential reverse lookup queries to the DNS server (IP: 2001:0df:0000:2003::0:35) to probe for live IPv6 records.

**Figure 7: Logical Network Diagram for Simulating a DNS Reconnaissance Attack**

- **Attacker:** 2001:0df:0000:2005:0a00:27ff:fe0e:662d
- **Router**
- **IDS Monitor** (with DNSG solution)
- **Local DNS Server:** 2001:0df:0000:2003::0:35

The attacker used the THC-IPv6 package, the IDS monitor had the DNSG solution implemented, and the local DNS server was configured with the reverse zone.

### Results

Both Bro and Suricata detected the attack and generated the correct alarms. The following log entries show examples of the output after detecting an IPv6 reverse reconnaissance attack:

```

### Related Work

Recent studies on IPv6 reconnaissance attacks can be categorized into two main areas: IPv6 address allocation strategies and DNS enumeration techniques.

#### 1. IPv6 Address Allocation Strategies

Scanning the entire 2^128 address space is impractical, but some studies have shown methods to reduce the search space. For example, manually configured IPv6 addresses often contain common patterns. If an attacker identifies these patterns, they can significantly reduce the address search space. Some network administrators sequentially increase the Interface Identifier (IID) field when generating new IPv6 addresses, or encode each byte of an IPv4 address into the IID. Studies by Malone [19] and Karpilovsky et al. [20] have analyzed the usage of different IID allocation mechanisms. Gont and Chown [2] found that 69.7% of clients use random IPv6 addresses, while 14.31% still use EUI-64 based addresses. Hu et al. [4] and Plonka and Berger [18] have also contributed to this area, highlighting the continued use of legacy methods and the need for more secure and privacy-focused allocation strategies.

#### 2. DNS Enumeration Techniques

Several groups have conducted global scanning using DNS reverse lookup techniques. Hu et al. [7] and Fiebig et al. [3] collected IPv6 reverse records by querying public DNS servers. Our study extends their work by measuring the security impact of placing IPv6 addresses in NSEC-enabled domains. To the best of our knowledge, no existing studies have used this methodology to globally collect IPv6 addresses.

### Discussion

Network reconnaissance is a key indicator of impending attacks. We discuss design choices for deploying DNS Guard (DNSG) and make recommendations for vendors and network administrators.

#### Recommendations for Network Administrators

- **Reconsider IPv6 Address Allocation Strategies:** Many studies suggest that common patterns in IIDs can be exploited by attackers. However, some administrators still use predictable patterns. We recommend using non-predictable values for the IID field.
- **Secure IPv6 Configuration for DNS Servers:** DNS servers should be configured securely. Suggested measures include removing the reverse DNS domain and using NSEC3 RR to prevent DNSSEC zone walks.

#### Recommendations for Security Vendors

- **Implement DNS Reconnaissance Detection:** By default, most Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) do not detect DNS reconnaissance attacks. We implemented our solution in Bro and Suricata, which successfully detected the attacks. However, Snort does not support this new mechanism due to its design. We urge security companies to update their products to address new IPv6 security challenges.

### Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we demonstrated the feasibility of launching address scanning attacks on IPv6 networks and highlighted potential issues in current IPv6 DNS deployments. We proposed a solution to detect such attacks and implemented it in Bro and Suricata. Future research will focus on evaluating new IPv6 vulnerabilities and the performance of DNSG in different network environments. Additionally, we will investigate the implications of using DHCPv6 in mobile devices and contribute to the knowledge base of IPv6 deployment.
