**ATT&CK ID:** T1558.003  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Kerberoasting

Adversaries may exploit a valid Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) or intercept network traffic to obtain a ticket-granting service (TGS) ticket. These TGS tickets, particularly those for service accounts, can be vulnerable to brute force attacks, allowing adversaries to crack the associated service account passwords.
