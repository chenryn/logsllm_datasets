### Introduction to Shopping Cart Immobilization Systems
- **Invisible Fence for Carts**: A system that locks shopping carts when they are taken out of the parking lot.
- **Other Applications**: Stopping "runouts" (carts rolling away).
- **Economic Impact**: Gatekeeper Systems estimates $180 million in annual shopping cart theft.

### Why Focus on Shopping Cart Wheels?
- **Hacking Philosophy**: "It's not worth doing something unless someone, somewhere, would much rather you weren't doing it." - Sir Terry Pratchett

### How Do They Work?
- **Magnetic Loop System**:
  - **Underground Perimeter Wire**: Sends out a signal.
  - **Magnetic Field**: Current through the wire produces a magnetic field.
  - **Cart Mechanism**: Senses the field and locks using an internal mechanism.
  - **Unlocking**: Store staff uses a remote to unlock the carts.

### Anatomy of a Shopping Cart Wheel - Locking Mechanism
- **Mechanism**:
  - **Expanding/Contracting Inner Ring**: Ridges on the inner ring lock into ridges inside the wheel casing.
- **Internal Components**:
  - **3V Lithium Battery**: Likely optimized for low power consumption.
  - **DC Motor**: Drives a gearbox to expand/contract the ring.
  - **PCB Assembly**: Hosts radios and a microcontroller.

### Detailed PCB Assembly
- **Antennas**:
  - **2.4 GHz Antenna**: PCB Trace
  - **7.8 KHz Inductor**: VLF Antenna
- **Microcontroller**: TI CC2510 with built-in 2.4 GHz transceiver and low-power modes.
- **Motor Driver Circuit** and **VLF Amplifier**.
- **JTAG Port**: For programming the chip.

### Research Methods
- **FCC.gov**: A goldmine of information.
- **Patent Searches**.
- **Community Contributions**: tmplab.org's "consumer-b-gone" project.

### Key Findings
- **Control Frequencies**:
  - **Below 9 KHz**: Problematic due to interference.
  - **2.4 GHz ISM Band**: Less problematic.
- **Modulation**: 2.4 GHz modulated using MSK/FSK.

### Capturing the VLF Signal
- **Challenges**:
  - **Very-Low Frequency (VLF)**: 1 MHz.
  - **Audio Range**: 9 KHz can be captured using audio amplification equipment.
- **Inspiration**: tmplab.org hackers.

### Apology to RF Engineers
- **Basic Loopstick Antenna**:
  - **Components**: Ferrite core, magnet wire, ~21 mH inductance, tuning capacitor.
  - **3.5mm Jack**: 2.5 kΩ resistor to trick the audio port into thinking it’s a microphone.

### Field Testing
- **Signal Capture**: Successfully observed a signal.
- **Spectrogram Analysis**: Identified key frequencies at 7.8 kHz and 15.6 kHz.

### Unlock and 2.4 GHz Signals
- **CartKey**:
  - **Unlock Signal**: 7.8 KHz and 2.4 GHz.
  - **Lock Signal**: Only 7.8 KHz.
- **Ebay**: A source for obtaining CartKeys.

### Signal Captures
- **V1 vs V2 CartKey**:
  - **Lock and Unlock Signals**: Compared and analyzed.
  - **Bit Patterns**:
    - **Lock**: 0b10001110
    - **Unlock**: 0b01110001
  - **Observation**: The lock signal is the inverse of the unlock signal.

### Replay Attacks
- **Feasibility**:
  - **Loopstick Antenna**: Short range (~2 ft with a 10W amplifier).
  - **Phone Speakers/Headphones**: Can also replay signals.
- **Range Limitations**:
  - **Bigger Coil**: Found at the MIT Flea.
  - **External Amplifier**: 10W Audio Amplifier.
  - **Physics Constraints**: Inverse square rule and directional limitations.

### Analyzing the 2.4 GHz Signal
- **Tools**:
  - **HackRF SDR**: 1 MHz - 6 GHz range.
  - **Gqrx and URH**: For signal analysis.
- **Modulation**:
  - **2FSK Modulation**.
  - **Center Frequency**: 2.417 GHz.
  - **Spacing**: 4.4 MHz.
  - **Frequencies**: FLow = 2.41480 GHz, FHigh = 2.41919 GHz.

### Replaying the 2.4 GHz Unlock Command
- **Process**:
  - **URH**: Export captures as .wav files.
  - **Audacity**: Edit waveforms to create new commands.
  - **Rebroadcast**: Play .wav file through HackRF.

### Creating a 2.4 GHz Unlock Command from Scratch
- **Steps**:
  - **Audacity**: Create and edit the command.
  - **Testing**: Successful rebroadcast and unlocking.

### Is There a 2.4 GHz Lock Signal?
- **Investigation**:
  - **No Triggered Lock**: No combination of 1s and 0s like the unlock signal triggered a lock.
  - **Advanced Functionality**: Unexplored features in the wheels.
  - **Gatekeeper Systems**: Likely chose not to implement this feature to prevent unintended locking.

### Potential Uses
- **Short-Range Locking**: Within a few feet.
- **Unlocking Locked Carts**: Easier ways to obtain a cart if that’s the goal.
- **Knowledge**: Understanding hidden systems.

### Ethical Considerations
- **Responsible Use**: Please don’t misuse this information.
