#### Identifying a Photographer
The URL of the page where a photo is posted can provide important clues to reveal a photographer’s online identity. For example, the URL `https://plus.google.com/XYZ/photos` suggests that the photographer has a Google+ account with the ID "XYZ." By following this URL, additional information such as the photographer's real name, colleges attended, current employer, and photos posted on their account can be retrieved. Our dataset includes many such URLs with embedded photographers' OSN account IDs, including but not limited to Flickr, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and 500px. A photographer may have multiple OSN accounts disclosed in this manner.

Table 4 lists the typical information contained in an account profile for the five social networks mentioned above. This information often includes demographics and other sensitive details such as age, gender, education, occupation, living city, and other OSN accounts. Once one OSN account is identified, the user's real-world identity can be readily disclosed.

### Figure 10: Percentage of Camera Serial Numbers with Identified OSN Accounts

- **51.4% (533)** of the 1,037 unique serial numbers in our dataset had the camera owners' OSN accounts identified.
- **9.0% (93)** of these serial numbers had account IDs in two or more OSNs identified.
- For one serial number, we identified the camera owner's four account IDs across four different OSNs.

#### Metadata Analysis
As previously mentioned, we were able to retrieve approximately 37 online photos on average for each given serial number. These photos, tagged with the same serial number, may contain metadata that could help identify the photographer. We closely examined the metadata embedded in the related photos for the remaining 504 serial numbers without any identified OSN accounts. Among these, we successfully identified the photographers for 116 serial numbers. The available information for these 116 photographers was primarily limited to names, processing software, and operating systems used. However, more information could be collected online once a person's name is identified. Overall, **62.6% (649)** of the serial numbers had their photographers identified.

### 7. Discussion
One goal of this work is to track the propagation of sensitive metadata information embedded in digital photos at different stages. Ideally, this would involve monitoring the creation, modification, and elimination of metadata in a set of photos that sequentially experience three stages: "fresh," "intact," and "wild." However, obtaining such a large-scale, ideal photo set is challenging. Instead, we employed different data collection methods to obtain three types of photo sets representing these stages.

- **"Fresh" Photos**: We collected 612 valid "fresh" photos through crowdsourcing over two months. Each photo was taken by a unique participant with a unique device, and participants from 76 countries contributed to this dataset. To avoid data contamination, only photos taken with smartphones were solicited.
- **"Intact" and "Wild" Photos**: To infer online media sites' policies on handling metadata, we adopted a passive approach by examining the metadata of photos collected from these sites. An active approach, involving uploading and re-downloading photos, was considered but abandoned due to the specific user groups and registration restrictions of most sites.

### Table 5: Main Functions of the Browser Extension Prototype

| Sensitive Metadata | Potential Threats                | Website's Policy                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Geolocation        | Location Disclosure, House Robbery | Metadata Removing               |
| Photographer's Name | Identity Disclosure              | Photo Resizing                  |
| Modification History | Undermining Photo's Authenticity | NA                              |
| Camera Serial Number | Re-identification Attack         | NA                              |

Although it is known that a camera serial number can uniquely identify a camera, previous research has not systematically explored the potential threats arising from this attribute. We demonstrated the feasibility of a re-identification attack using camera serial numbers, identifying over 60% of photo owners based on their serial numbers in a public online database.

### 8. Related Work
Several studies have conducted user surveys to understand privacy decisions and concerns during photo sharing. For example:
- **Clark et al. [11]** revealed unintended photo storage issues caused by cloud-based backup services.
- **Ahern et al. [12]** found that mobile users' decisions to post photos publicly or privately were influenced more by identity and impression concerns than security.
- **Besmer et al. [13]** studied users' perceptions of being tagged in undesired photos and found that privacy concerns were related to identity and impression management within existing social circles.
- **Henne et al. [14]** showed that personal references and location data in tagged photos raised the most privacy concerns.

Other researchers have examined the privacy threats posed by textual metadata in online photos:
- **Friedland and Sommer [15]** focused on geolocation data and its use in mounting privacy attacks.
- **Pesce et al. [17]** demonstrated that photo tagging on Facebook could enhance predictions of users' information like gender, city, and country.
- **Mahmood and Desmedt [16]** discussed privacy violations from Google+'s policy of making metadata visible to anyone who accesses a photo.

While these works addressed privacy issues with photos, our study assesses privacy risks on a larger scale, covering various stages of photos and a wide range of sensitive metadata. We also introduce a new attack vector using camera serial numbers and measure photo handling policies across hundreds of top-ranked websites.

### 9. Conclusion
In this paper, we performed a data-driven assessment of privacy risks associated with contemporary digital photos. We collected nearly 200,000 digital photos at three different stages and measured the prevalence of metadata and assessed the privacy risks. We found that metadata is prevalent among digital photos, with 15% of "fresh" photos, about 30% of "intact" photos, and about 1% of "wild" photos containing GPS coordinates. The lower percentage of "wild" photos with sensitive metadata suggests that online sites often remove metadata. We confirmed this by investigating photo handling policies based on nearly 100,000 photos from 679 top sites in seven categories. We also proposed using the camera serial number as a new attack vector for privacy inference, demonstrating its power in deriving both online and real-world identities of photographers. In future work, we will develop a browser extension prototype to prevent photo privacy leakage and increase users' awareness of online services' photo handling policies.

### Acknowledgment
We thank our shepherd Chris Kanich and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful and detailed comments. This work was partially supported by ARO grant W911NF-15-1-0287 and ONR grant N00014-13-1-0088. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the funding agencies.

### Ethical Consideration
Our study involved several methods to collect photos, including:
1. Soliciting "fresh" photos from crowdsourcing workers.
2. Crawling photos from Flickr using its API.
3. Random Google Image Search.
4. Crawling top websites for limited amounts of photos.

Our crowdsourcing study was vetted and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at our institution. During photo collection, we did not receive any concerns or warnings from the involved sites and did not interfere with their normal operations. We anonymized the metadata information before using the photos for study and strictly adhered to copyright licenses when present.
