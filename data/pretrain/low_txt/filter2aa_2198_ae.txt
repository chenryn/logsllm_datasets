In the message, DOTCOM stated that "I told you many times not to delete links that are reported in batches of thousands from insignificant sources.

This made me very mad, especially because I told you that such mass deletions should be prevented and sources checked much more carefully. I am sure such mass link deletions are also contributing to a drop in revenue... In the future, please do not delete thousands of links at once from a single source unless it comes from a major organization in the US."
