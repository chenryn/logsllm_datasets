## Abstract

Proactive approaches to failure avoidance, recovery, and maintenance have recently gained significant interest among researchers and practitioners in various areas of dependable system design and operation. This inaugural workshop aimed to provide a stimulating and fruitful forum to foster collaboration among researchers working on proactive fault management. The goal was to discuss ideas, exchange experiences, and find new solutions to the overall challenge of significantly improving system dependability in contemporary computing and communication systems.

## Themes, Goals, and Objectives

Over the past decade, there has been a shift from reactive to proactive methods in dependable computing research. Traditionally, fault tolerance focused on reacting to errors or component failures to prevent system failures through extensive use of redundancy, and maintenance followed fixed, time-based plans. However, due to increasing system complexity, the use of commercial off-the-shelf components, virtualization, ongoing system patches and updates, and other factors, such approaches have become difficult to apply. As a result, a new area of dependability research has emerged, focusing on proactive approaches that act before problems arise to increase time-to-failure and/or reduce time-to-repair.

Specifically, these techniques typically involve:
- **Runtime monitoring** to continuously measure the system's state.
- **Algorithms** to anticipate upcoming problems.
- **Predictive diagnosis** focused on the root cause of the impending problem.
- **Decision and scheduling techniques** to determine which method should be applied and when.
- **Efficient and effective techniques** to avoid upcoming failures, minimize their negative effects, or improve system dependability through maintenance.

Industry and academia have proposed several terms for such techniques, including self-* computing, autonomic computing, trustworthy computing, proactive maintenance, and proactive fault management, each focusing on somewhat different aspects. The increased interest in proactive failure avoidance, recovery, and maintenance techniques is evident from the rising number of papers published in major general dependability conferences such as DSN, SRDS, PRDC, and EDCC.

The goal of this workshop was to bring together researchers from around the world to form a community within the broader community of dependable computing. To achieve this, the workshop provided a stimulating and fruitful forum to foster collaboration among researchers working on similar topics, to discuss ideas, exchange experiences, and find new answers to the overall challenge of significantly improving system dependability in contemporary computing and communication systems. In fact, there is some evidence that with comprehensive use of proactive fault management methods, the dependability in server cluster environments (e.g., cloud computing) can be increased by an order of magnitude or more.

## Main Challenges

Several topics were addressed, ranging from theory to practice, to inspire research, design techniques, and implementation from both industry and academia. Topics included, but were not limited to:
- **Runtime dependability assessment and evaluation** (reliability, availability, etc.).
- **Runtime monitoring** for online fault detection and diagnosis, including monitoring data processing.
- **Prediction methods** to anticipate failures, resource exhaustion, or other critical situations in complex systems, distributed systems, adaptive, or peer-to-peer networks.
- **Predictive diagnosis and fault location** as well as root-cause analysis.
- **Optimal decision algorithms and policies** to manage and schedule the application of actions.
- **Downtime minimization or avoidance mechanisms** such as preventive failover, state cleanup, proactive reconfiguration, failure-prevention-driven load balancing, prediction-driven restarts, rejuvenation, adaptive checkpointing, or other prediction-driven enhancements of traditional repair methods.
- **Proactive fault management and maintenance techniques** such as monitoring-based replacement, configuration, and management of computer systems and components.
- **Dependability evaluation** including models to assess the impact on metrics such as availability, reliability, security, performability, and user-oriented metrics such as service availability.
- **Case studies, applications, experiments, and experience reports.**

Out of the seven papers accepted for the workshop, the entire spectrum of problems in proactive fault management was addressed, including online dependability monitoring and evaluation, root cause analysis, misconfiguration detection, performance-aware regeneration, and error log assessment by software fault injection.
