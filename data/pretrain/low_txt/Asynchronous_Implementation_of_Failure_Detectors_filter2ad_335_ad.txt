**Analysis of p(x) in Relation to Session Length x**

The lowest curve in the figure depicts \( p(2n) \) for \( 5 \leq n \leq 10 \). These curves illustrate the relationship between \( p(x) \) and the session length \( x \). More interestingly, they show that when \( x \leq 2n \), \( p(x) \) is very close to 1 for \( n \geq 7 \). Intuitively, adding more processes increases the likelihood of satisfying \( PR1(S) \).

This observation is confirmed and quantified in Figure 2(a), which shows that as the number of processes \( n \) increases, the probability \( p(x) \) also increases and quickly approaches 1. For \( n \geq 7 \), the probability \( p(x) \) is very close to 1, indicating that \( PR1(S) \) is practically satisfied in asynchronous distributed systems with at least 7 processes, provided the sessions (during which the upper layer application uses the failure detector of class S) are not excessively long.

**Complementary View in Figure 2(b)**

Figure 2(b) provides a complementary perspective. The horizontal axis represents the number of processes \( n \), while the vertical axis represents the length of the observation period (number of rounds \( x \)). For a given probability \( p \), this figure illustrates how long an upper layer session can be (in terms of the number of rounds \( x \)) for an asynchronous system with \( n \) processes (where \( 5 \leq n \leq 14 \)) to satisfy \( PR1(S) \) with the specified probability. The lowest curve corresponds to \( p = 0.9999 \), and the highest corresponds to \( p = 0.9900 \). These curves further demonstrate that an asynchronous distributed system satisfies \( PR1(S) \) with a very high probability.

**Behavioral Properties: PR(P) and PR(3P)**

Let us consider the following two behavioral properties:
- **PR(P):** For each process \( p_i \), from the beginning of the execution until \( p_i \) possibly crashes, there exists a set \( Q \) of \( f + 1 \) processes such that each process \( p_j \in Q \) receives a response from \( p_i \) to each of its queries until \( p_j \) possibly crashes.
- **PR(3P):** This property holds only after a finite time.

Interestingly, the protocol described in Figure 1 is highly general: without any modifications, it implements a failure detector of the class P (or 3P) when the underlying system satisfies the property PR(P) (or PR(3P)). The proof follows a similar structure to the previous one.

**Conclusion**

This paper presents a new approach to implementing Chandra-Toueg's unreliable failure detectors. Unlike previous methods, the proposed approach does not rely on additional synchrony assumptions, allowing communication times to always increase. It is based on a query-response mechanism, assuming that the responses from some processes to some process queries always arrive among the first \( n - f \) responses.

A general protocol for implementing failure detectors has been presented, which works for any value of \( f \). The specific failure detector built (i.e., a failure detector of the class P, S, 3P, or 3S) depends on the properties satisfied by the underlying system. When \( f = 1 \), these properties reduce to a simple channel property: eventually, there is a pair of processes \( (p_i, p_j) \) such that the channel connecting them is never the slowest among the channels connecting \( p_i \) or \( p_j \) to the other processes. A probabilistic analysis has shown that this requirement is practically relevant.

A particular property involves a subset of the processes and a subset of the channels connecting them. Practically, this means that such a property can be "ensured" by designing an appropriate cluster of \( f + 1 \) processes. The proposed approach could be combined with the Timely Computing Base (T CB) approach [26] to build dependable applications, with the T CB providing a cluster of \( f + 1 \) processes.
