     - Client `/10.10.34.11:54983` (session ID `0x14ed93111f200f0`) at 17:36:31.

2. **Accepted Socket Connection**:
   - A new socket connection was accepted from client `/10.10.34.29:39387` at 16:12:02.

3. **New Session Attempts**:
   - Several clients attempted to establish new sessions:
     - Client `/10.10.34.11:53821` at 16:18:34.
     - Client `/10.10.34.12:45668` at 16:18:34.
     - Client `/10.10.34.12:45675` at 16:21:28.
     - Client `/10.10.34.11:54632` at 17:06:40.
     - Client `/10.10.34.11:54738` at 17:13:32.

4. **Established Session**:
   - A new session was established with client `/10.10.34.13:37467` (session ID `0x14ed93111f200df`) with a negotiated timeout of 10,000 milliseconds at 17:06:40.

5. **Dropped Old Client Connections**:
   - Multiple old client connections were flagged to be dropped if the server is in read-only (r-o) mode:
     - Client `/10.10.34.19:33442` at 16:12:01.
     - Client `/10.10.34.20:56418` at 16:18:36.
     - Client `/10.10.34.42:34164` at 16:18:38.

     - Client `/10.10.34.13:37454` at 16:44:36.

6. **End of Stream Exceptions**:
   - End of stream exceptions were caught at 17:11:54 and 17:22:34, indicating potential issues with data transmission.

7. **Server Environment**:
   - The server environment's user directory (`user.dir`) is set to `/` as indicated at 17:43:58.

In summary, this log excerpt details the dynamic nature of client connections to the ZooKeeper server, including the establishment and termination of sessions, handling of old client connections, and some operational exceptions.
