**Technical Details Worked Out:**

- **New Protocol Needed:** No security required initially as it was a closed network.
- **Inviting Other Operators:** Potential for broader connectivity and services.
- **ITU Involvement:** Assistance from someone in ITU.
- **Network Ownership:** Controlled by governments.

- **Evolution of IPX:**
  - Started with 5 Nordic operators about 35 years ago.
  - Now, approximately 2000 companies are connected, including mobile operators, service providers, and satellite communication providers.
  - Highly inhomogeneous operator structure.
  - Networks include 2G, 2.5G, 3G, 4G, and now 5G.
  - Different hardware, protocols, products, and releases.
  - Multiple services such as voice, SMS, MMS, IMS, data, and VoIP.
  - Security awareness began only recently (2014).

**New Protocol - New Luck?**

## Slide 21
**Bell Labs**

**I Switch On My Phone in Las Vegas:**

- **Antenna** → **Core Network** → **Carrier/IPX** → **Carrier/IPX** → **Core Network**
- **Checking Subscriber:**
  - "Does she have money, and what did he pay for?"
  - "Make sure it is really her"

## Slide 22
**Bell Labs**

**Network Used for Testing of Attack:**

## Slide 33
**Bell Labs**

**Countermeasures for Operators:**

- **S9 Interface:**
  - Use IPSec with trusted partners directly.
  - Open S9 only on a need basis.
  - Route via origin realm and origin host.
  - IMSI range - operator match.
  - Check not to get messages from yourself.
  - Logical separation of visitors and own subscribers.
  - Location distance.
  - Fingerprint partner.
  - Fingerprint "flows".

**For "Normal" Users:**

- **Check Your Bill**
- **Stay Informed About News**
