### DNS and Large Responses

Large DNS/UDP responses have been shown to cause unreachability in previous studies [51, 53]. In 2011, Weaver et al. [53] used active measurements to demonstrate that 9% of clients could not receive fragmented DNS/UDP packets. Given our vantage point is not at the client side, we cannot determine this rate. However, we observed the number of ICMP messages indicating that DNS messages exceed the path MTU (Section 3.2). 

In a 2012 study [51], the authors analyzed 8.4 million DNSSEC messages from 230,000 resolvers to authoritative servers hosted by SURFnet, the Dutch NREN, for over 4,000 zones. They found that 58% of resolvers received fragmented responses for DNSSEC queries.

Our results contrast with these studies. By analyzing 164 billion queries from more than 3 million resolvers for one zone (.nl), we found a very small fraction of fragmented queries (10,000 per day, Section 3.2). Our vantage point only allows us to measure the server-side. Additionally, we analyzed truncation, response size distribution, resolver behavior, and EDNS0 distribution from two distinct large DNS anycast operators that provide DNS service to .nl. A 2020 study by Google Public DNS operators [28] showed similar rates of truncation and fragmentation, but measured on the resolver side.

### New Protocols and Features

Over the past few years, several alternatives to traditional DNS have emerged, such as DNS over HTTPS (DoH) [18], DNS over TLS (DoTLS) [20], and DNS over QUIC [21]. New features are also being added to DNS, such as Encrypted SNI (ESNI) [42]. While we do not cover these new protocols here—our authoritative servers only support traditional DNS—it will be necessary to evaluate how they handle truncation and/or fragmentation. For example, Google rarely truncates responses for its public DoTLS and DoH services [15], even though both run on TCP.

### Conclusions

DNS/UDP large messages leading to fragmentation have long been feared and blamed for causing unreachability. Drawing from 164 billion queries and responses, we assess the current state of large messages in DNS. We show that large responses are rare (for .nl), and server-side IP fragmentation is minimal. In cases where clients experience query timeouts on DNS/UDP, we find that 75% of resolvers fall back to TCP, thereby retrieving large responses. Previous research has indicated that "hammering" and server switching—behaviors exhibited by resolvers in the wild—are expected to be useful in avoiding unreachability. However, our evaluation of more than 3 million resolvers shows that many still have a long way to go: many announce either small (512 bytes) or large (4,096 bytes) EDNS0 buffer sizes, both leading to more truncation and increasing the chances of fragmentation/packets being lost on the network.

We also show that the initial uptake of the DNS Flag Day 2020 suggested EDNS0 buffer size has not been very wide. Similar to the adoption of DNSSEC algorithms, it would be interesting to evaluate this adoption over time, especially now that major resolver vendors have adopted this value.

### Extra Graphs

Figure 10 shows the truncated queries for NS3 in 2020. Figure 11 shows the time-series of truncated queries for .nl in July 2019. We observe a close match between UDP truncated queries and TCP ones, although not exactly the same. Figure 11 also shows the CDF of DNS/UDP truncated queries for 2019, per server.

### A.1 Clients and Large DNS/UDP Responses

We evaluated whether DNS messages are being lost along the way from authoritative servers to clients. To do this, we set up two measurements using RIPE Atlas (approximately 10,000 probes), as shown in Table 5. Each probe was configured to send a query directly to NS3, the server that returns additional records, thus bypassing local resolvers and preventing fallback to TCP. We set up two measurements: one for large DNS/UDP responses (1,744 bytes) and one for small responses (221 bytes).

In total, 8,576 probes were active on both measurements, sending more than 1 million queries (512,000 for the large and 510,000 for the small). For each probe, we examined the number of failed responses (timeouts) for both the small and large measurements. We found that 6.9% of queries timed out for the large measurement, while 2.5% timed out for the small measurement.

Next, we investigated each probe and computed the percentage of timeout queries per dataset. We then calculated the difference between the rate of failed queries for the large and small datasets. Out of the 8,576 probes, 6,191 had no error difference for both large and small queries (72%). 10% had more errors for the small dataset, and only 17% had more errors for the longer answers. 325 probes had 100% errors for the large dataset but no errors for the small dataset. Overall, this measurement indicates that fragmentation is still an issue on the client side, justifying the DNS Flag Day.
