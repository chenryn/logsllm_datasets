# Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

When working with images in a file explorer, it is often necessary to view them in full size or to zoom in for a closer look. Currently, this requires opening the image in an external application such as Photos, which can be time-consuming and only allows viewing one image at a time.

To address this, I propose integrating a simple gallery feature directly into the file explorer. This feature could be activated via a keyboard shortcut or a button in the ribbon, allowing users to browse through images more smoothly and efficiently.

I have developed a prototype of this functionality in my project, and you can find more details and demonstrations [here](https://github.com/martinchrzan/FileExplorerGallery).

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

I am willing to integrate my project, [FileExplorerGallery](https://github.com/martinchrzan/FileExplorerGallery), into PowerToys. This integration would provide a seamless experience for users, enhancing their ability to view and manage images within the file explorer.
