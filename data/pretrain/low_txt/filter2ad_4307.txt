## Abstract
The recent advancements in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) have demonstrated increased flexibility in network control and management by various stakeholders, including users, infrastructure providers, and virtual network operators. SDN brings programmability to network elements, merging data communications with telecommunications. This paper proposes the integration of external data, such as information from Online Social Networks (OSNs), into SDN to enable intelligent traffic engineering decisions. The proposed architecture, called Social SDN, includes necessary northbound APIs to interface OSN data with control functions that make traffic engineering decisions. We demonstrate a use case where homeowners can express network sharing policies based on social relationships, providing varying Quality of Service (QoS) levels to users.

## 1. Introduction
Recent advances in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) have shown greater flexibility in controlling and managing access networks for various stakeholders, such as users, infrastructure providers, and virtual network operators [3]. SDN is an evolution that introduces programmability to network elements by integrating data communications with telecommunications, extending the need for higher programmability from data centers to wider area networks. Network operators leverage the flexibility of SDN to make time and cost-critical traffic engineering decisions, reducing costs for all network users and operators. They perform large-scale data analytics on internal network and traffic data, which is then fed back to network applications to reconfigure and manage the network. The integration of Big Data with SDN is seen as a key strategy by network operators.

In this paper, we propose integrating external data (e.g., information from Facebook, Twitter, news feeds) with SDN to enable operators to make intelligent traffic engineering decisions. This integration would allow operators to identify not only internal network and traffic characteristics but also external/user needs, dynamically engineering the network to support user requirements. For example, data from OSNs could predict resource allocation needs, such as understanding Twitter trends to anticipate flash crowds and allocate resources accordingly, or estimating demand for certain TV programs and allocating network capacity.

Such integration would also be beneficial during emergencies, like natural disasters or terrorist activities, where networks could be opened to the public for communication. We define Social SDN, an SDN architecture that integrates OSNs with wireless networks. The architecture includes necessary northbound APIs to interface OSN data with control functions, which make traffic engineering decisions and push them to the network via southbound APIs. We demonstrate a use case where homeowners can express network sharing policies based on online social relationships, translating these policies into traffic engineering decisions to provide varying QoS levels to users.

## 2. Architecture
Our proposed architecture (Figure 1) features a control plane that exposes a minimal northbound RESTful API, allowing third-party applications to access various control functions for queue/QoS management, traffic redirection, etc. Specific applications can utilize policies expressed by different stakeholders and mined data from OSNs to orchestrate new rules within the network. These control functions are distributed across the network, and we demonstrate one such function in the next section.

The Access Point Manager (APM) resides in home broadband access points, exposing a configuration API for traffic shaping queues, QoS management, and an OpenFlow control interface. The Slice Manager enables the creation and management of individual network slices, providing strict traffic isolation and guarantees. The Topology Discovery function provides a global view of node resource availability, which is used for path computation and traffic redirection within individual slices, complemented by usage monitoring. All network control decisions (new rules) are pushed to the data plane via southbound APIs supporting both OpenFlow and legacy protocols like NETCONF and SNMP.

## 3. Use Case: Exploiting Online Social Relationships for Home Bandwidth Management
This use case demonstrates how online social relationships can be translated into network sharing decisions. We developed an application that allows homeowners to express network sharing policies based on social relationships. These policies are then translated into traffic engineering decisions, providing varying QoS levels to users based on their OSN relationship with the sharer.

The sharing policies are based on social relationships, such as "friendships" on Facebook, classified into different relationship classes (e.g., close friends, family, acquaintances, or not in the friend’s list). These classes are intuitive for users, making it easy to translate Facebook classifications into different user classes within a network, each receiving different resource allocations. For example, users in the "close friends" group may receive higher bandwidth than non-friends.

While solutions like Openwiﬁ [5], FON [2], and Cisco Meraki [1] allow users to log into wireless networks using Facebook credentials, they do not support customized sharing policies or control over capacity allocation. Our application, running on the home access point, checks if a user is authenticated. If not, the user is redirected to a Facebook login page. Upon successful authentication, the application uses the Facebook Graph API to determine the social relationship between the user and the network owner, categorizing the user into the appropriate class. This data is used to create a mapping between the user and QoS, and the controller pushes the specific OpenFlow rule to the APM, granting access and capacity based on the sharing policies.

### Ongoing Work
We have built a prototype of the use case by integrating a kernel module of Open vSwitch on OpenWRT. The controller was developed by extending the functionality of the Floodlight controller (v0.9). The code is publicly available at [4]. Further work includes developing new applications to demonstrate the benefits of our proposed architecture and conducting performance benchmarking of the control plane functions.
