### Modeling Service Relationships for Service Networks

#### 1. Introduction
Our approach to implementing service relationships is pragmatic, with the goal of creating a linked global service network using machine-readable descriptions [26]. The model is implemented using the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which allows semantic information to be expressed as a graph. To enhance integration with other semantic web initiatives, the model establishes links with various existing ontologies, reusing concepts from vertical and horizontal domains such as SKOS (taxonomies), Dublin Core (documents), and Linked-USDL (service descriptions). The implementation is available at: <http://rdfs.genssiz.org/ossr.rdf>.

#### 2. OSSR Model and Integration with Linked-USDL
The Open Semantic Service Relationship (OSSR) model was designed to integrate with Linked-USDL. This means that a relationship can connect two service systems, each of which can be represented using Linked-USDL. Since the model references services using URIs, other service descriptions like WSDL, OWL-S, and *-USDL [7, 8] can also be used. USDL is particularly beneficial because it bridges business, operational, and technical perspectives to describe services. Once services and relationships are described in RDF using Linked-USDL and OSSR, respectively, it becomes possible to query distributed service networks using the SPARQL RDF query language [27].

**Example:**
Listing 1 illustrates the use of the OSSR model. The relationship, identified by <http://rdfs.genssiz.org/ossr/2012/10/>, relates two services: SugarCRM and MySQL. The first service, SugarCRM, is modeled with Linked-USDL, and its modeling is available at <http://rdfs.genssiz.org/SugarCRM.ttl>. The second service, MySQL, is available at <http://www.mysql.com/>. The relationship is modeled from the perspective of SugarCRM, as the OSSR model specifies that it is the source element.

**Explanation:**
- The relationship indicates that the MySQL service system is a provider of the SugarCRM service.
- The two services have a high degree of involvement.
- They establish a relation at the activity level.
- The service systems are different.
- MySQL is a component of the SugarCRM service offering.
- A cause-effect relation on quality is established between the KPI Availability of SugarCRM and the KPI Reliability of MySQL. This causality is positive, meaning that an increase or decrease in MySQL's reliability directly affects the availability of the SugarCRM service.

#### 3. Related Work
Research on service relationships has primarily been conducted in the fields of business management, supply chain management, and operations management. Key contributions (e.g., [13, 14, 15, 9]) have generally focused on the objectives, motivations, and benefits of relationships for businesses. While business relationships look at relationships from a macro perspective, service relationships focus on a micro perspective. According to Jensen and Petersen [28], in service-based economies, there is a need to move from a macro strategic business orientation to a fine-grained activity-based service analysis. Previous work does not propose conceptual models or formalisms to build computer-understandable descriptions of relationships, as described in this paper.

- **e3service [22]**: Provides an ontology to model e-business models and services. It targets simple relations between services from an internal perspective but does not capture explicit service networks across agents or analyze the quantitative effects of relationships.
- **Service Network Notation (SNN) [29]**: Presents UML artifacts to model value chain relationships of economic value. These relationships are 'weak' as they only capture offerings and rewards. The focus is on compositions, processes, and how new services can be created using BPM to describe the interactions of existing SOA-based services.
- **Graph-based Notation [30, 31]**: Uses graphical representations to model value flows inside a network of agents, including the exchange of goods, services, revenue, knowledge, and intangible values. However, these approaches only consider value flows and do not account for other types of relationships between agents.

In all these works, relationships can benefit from a deeper study to increase their expressiveness beyond simply connecting flows, cross-organizational processes, or calculating the global added value of distributed activities. Roles, categorization, KPI dependencies, and cause-effect relations also need to be considered. Existing modeling approaches often fail to adhere to service-dominant logic [2] and focus too much inwardly on the company rather than the service network.

#### 4. Conclusions
To provide theories and methods for analyzing service networks, it is essential to model service systems and service relationships. In this paper, we addressed the latter: the modeling of service relationships. Our approach assumes that service systems are represented using existing description languages like Linked-USDL and derives a rich, multi-level relationship model—named the Open Semantic Service Relationship (OSSR) model—from an extensive literature review process. Service relationships differ significantly from the temporal and control-flow relations found in business process models. They need to relate service systems while accounting for various perspectives such as roles, associations, dependencies, and comparisons. After designing the OSSR conceptual model, it was evaluated and implemented. The encoding was based on Linked Data principles to retain simplicity for computation, reuse existing vocabularies to maximize compatibility, and provide a simple yet effective means for publishing and interlinking distributed service descriptions for automated computer analysis.
