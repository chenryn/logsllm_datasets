## Abstract
Mobile security and privacy issues are receiving significant attention from the research community. The SPSM workshop was established to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners interested in these issues to gather and exchange ideas. Following the success of previous editions, we present the sixth edition of the workshop. This year's event brings together the expertise of an international program committee comprising 22 mobile security experts from academia and industry. The workshop received 31 submissions (regular and short papers combined) from authors located in 19 countries.

## 1. Motivation
Mobile devices such as smartphones and internet tablets now possess computing and networking capabilities comparable to traditional personal computers. Their widespread adoption has also introduced new security and privacy challenges. For example, the prevalence of information-stealing applications raises substantial concerns. The operating systems supporting these devices have both advantages and disadvantages in terms of security. On one hand, they use application sandboxing to contain exploits and limit the privileges given to malware. On the other hand, they routinely collect and organize various forms of security- and privacy-sensitive information, making it easily accessible to third-party applications.

## 2. Topics
Recognizing smartphone security and privacy as an emerging area, this workshop aims to provide a venue for researchers and practitioners to share and discuss their ideas. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Device/hardware security
- OS/middleware security
- Application security
- User authentication to devices and services
- Mobile web browsers
- Usability
- Privacy
- Rogue application detection and recovery
- Vulnerability detection and remediation
- Secure application development
- Cloud support for mobile security
- Mobile device management
- Mobile ads
- Dual persona management and isolation

We also encourage novel paradigms and controversial ideas that are not listed above. The workshop serves as a forum for creative debate and interaction in security- and privacy-sensitive areas of computing and communication impacted by smartphones. We favor submissions that are radical, forward-looking, and open-ended, rather than mature work on the verge of conference or journal publication. In SPSM 2016, we reduced the page length requirement to 8–10 pages for regular papers to encourage such submissions. Submissions that discuss real-world problems without a solution are also encouraged.

## 6. PC Co-Chairs

### Long Lu
Long Lu is an assistant professor of computer science at Stony Brook University. He directs the RiS3 Lab and is a core member of the National Security Institute at Stony Brook. He earned his PhD in computer science from Georgia Tech in 2013. His research focuses on protecting software, systems, and their users against critical or emerging threats. Recent work includes comprehensive app vulnerability checkers, in-app security enforcement mechanisms, and new security primitives and designs for mobile OS. His research has been published at top security and systems conferences, including CCS, S&P, USENIX Security, NDSS, and MobiSys.

### Mohammad Mannan
Mohammad Mannan is an associate professor at the Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carleton University (2009), with a focus on Internet authentication and usable security. He was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Toronto from 2009 to 2011. His research interests lie in the area of Internet and systems security, with a focus on solving high-impact security and privacy problems of today’s Internet. He is involved in several well-known conferences (e.g., program committee: ACM CCS 2016, ACSAC 2014, USENIX Security 2010) and journals (e.g., ACM TISSEC, IEEE TDSC, IEEE TIFS).
