### Security Vulnerabilities of Magnetic Stripe Cards

Magnetic stripe cards are highly susceptible to attacks and duplication due to their limited security features [7]. Data stolen from these cards can be sold online or used to create counterfeit cards, which can then be used in physical stores [10, 6]. One of the primary methods for attacking magnetic stripe cards is through skimming devices, commonly known as "skimmers" [36].

### Enhancing Security Through Transaction Analysis

Efforts have been made to enhance the security of magnetic stripe cards by analyzing account transactions and identifying fraudulent activity. Some methods for detecting illegitimate transactions involve data mining and machine learning, which profile transactions based on historical data [16, 51, 17]. Techniques such as the Hidden Markov Model [50] and profiling normal card behavior [8, 9] have also been proposed. However, these methods are often a "best guess" and do not always prevent malicious transactions. The results are similar to current practices employed by credit card companies to identify the use of stolen magnetic stripe card data.

### Physical Authentication Methods

Additional efforts have focused on authenticating magnetic stripe cards through the physical characteristics of the data encoded on the cards. For example, MagnePrint [4] attempts to authenticate the physical magnetic material by calculating a fingerprint using the noise present between peaks in the analog waveform and matching it to a known value. However, MagnePrint has significant drawbacks, including the need to measure the card at the time of manufacture and the requirement for merchants to transmit the calculated signature during the authorization process. More recently, an improved system has been developed that can detect fraudulent magnetic stripe cards without the need for initial measurement [48].

### EMV (Chip-and-PIN) Technology

EMV, widely known as Chip-and-PIN, uses tamper-resistant cards that run code to perform card authentication with the issuer. While EMV provides more security features than magnetic stripe cards, they are still vulnerable to various attacks [53, 37, 12, 20, 22, 41, 21, 15]. Skimming devices specifically designed for EMV cards, known as Chip-and-Shim devices, also exist [33, 14]. Additionally, EMV has faced deployment issues [24, 39]. Although EMV is a more secure alternative, it is unlikely to fully replace magnetic stripe cards in the near future [27], indicating that magnetic stripe card fraud will remain a prevalent problem.

### Conclusion

Skimmers pose a significant and growing threat to payment terminals worldwide. Adversaries have become increasingly sophisticated, making the detection of such attacks challenging. To address these issues, we conducted the first large-scale academic analysis of skimming devices. By characterizing the techniques used by attackers, we debunked much of the common advice offered to protect consumers. We then developed the Skim Reaper tool, which leverages the necessary physical properties of the most common types of skimming devices found in New York City. After successfully testing our solution on real-world skimmers, we demonstrated that simple adversarial countermeasures are ineffective against our device. Through systematic analysis, characterization, and measurement, we show that robust and portable tools can be developed to help consumers and law enforcement rapidly detect such attacks.
