### Clustering Parameter Selection

Our implementation uses the DBSCAN algorithm with a clustering threshold of 8. To select this threshold, we performed clustering while varying the distances. Table 6 shows the number of clusters and the percentage of images regarded as noise by the clustering algorithm for different distances. We observe that for distances 2-4, there is a substantially larger percentage of noise, while with distance 10, we have the least percentage of noise. For distances between 6 and 8, we get a larger number of clusters, with noise percentages of 73% and 63%, respectively. 

To further evaluate the clustering performance for varying distances, we randomly selected 200 clusters and manually calculated the number of false positives within each cluster. Figure 13 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the false positive fraction in the random sample of clusters for distances 6, 8, and 10 (distances 2-4 were disregarded due to high noise). We observe that with distance 10, we have an unacceptably high fraction of false positives, while for distances 6-8, we see similar behavior with slightly more false positives at distance 8 (both cases have overall false positives below 3%). 

We also examined the impact of false positives on the overall dataset. We found all posts containing false positives and true positives from the random sample of 200 clusters with distance 8. The false positives occur substantially fewer times than true positives, with the percentage of true positives over the set of false positives and true positives being 99.4%. Therefore, due to the larger number of clusters, acceptable false positive performance, and smaller percentage of noise (compared to distances 2-6), we elected to use a perceptual distance of 8 as the threshold.

### KYM and Clustering Annotation Evaluation

While Know Your Meme (KYM) may not be a household name, it is one of the largest curated collections of memes on the web, making it a de facto authority on memes. However, KYM relies on crowdsourcing, which introduces some subjectivity. To measure the quality of KYM, we sampled 200 clusters and manually examined the corresponding KYM pages to determine if they properly documented what we consider "actual" memes. The 200 clusters mapped to 162 unique KYM pages, and of these, 3 (1.85%) were deemed "bad" due to incompleteness and a high number of random images in the gallery.

Next, we determined whether the labels (i.e., KYM pages) assigned to each cluster were appropriate. Using three annotators, we examined the KYM page, the medoid of the cluster, and the images in the cluster itself. The guidelines for labeling were:
- If the exact image(s) in the cluster appear in the KYM gallery, the label is correct.
- For images not in the KYM gallery, if the label is appropriate, it is a correct labeling.

There are important caveats:
- KYM galleries are crowdsourced and can contain random images, but this occurs with low probability.
- A label was considered correct if it was appropriate, even if not the best possible label.
- Memes are a cultural phenomenon, and potential cultural bias in our annotation is possible. Our annotators were born in three different countries (USA, Italy, and Cyprus), with only one native English speaker, and two having spent substantial time in the US.

After annotating the clusters, we computed the Fleiss' kappa (κ) agreement score, achieving a κ of 0.67, indicating substantial agreement. Finally, we obtained the majority agreement of all annotators to assess the accuracy of our annotation process, finding that 89% of the clusters had a legitimate annotation to a specific KYM entry.

|----------|-----------|--------|
| 2        | 30,327    | 82.9%  |
| 4        | 34,146    | 78.5%  |

| 8        | 38,851    | 62.8%  |
| 10       | 30,737    | 27.8%  |
