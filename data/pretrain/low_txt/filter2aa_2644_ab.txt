### 1. Introduction
At DEFCON 18, a presentation highlighted the vulnerabilities in industrial control systems, particularly in power plants. An unsecured network connection and open unused ports left the system vulnerable to attack. Fortunately, no damage was done to the system, and power service remained unaffected. Reports indicated that the attacker was attempting to penetrate deeper into the network to access more critical controls when the intrusion was discovered.

### 2. Threats to Plant Control Systems
#### 2.1. Targeted Attacks
Targeted attacks on plant control systems are not the only threat these networks face. Many common plant control systems rely on off-the-shelf operating platforms, making them vulnerable to mass malware programs. For example, in 2003, the Slammer worm caused a denial of service to parts of the safety and monitoring networks at the Davis-Besse nuclear plant in Ohio, which was offline at the time. The worm entered the plant's control network through an unsecured contractor connection, bypassing normal firewalls. According to the Repository of Industrial Security Incidents (RISI), nearly 50% of all reported cybersecurity incidents in 2010 were caused by viruses, worms, and Trojans.

#### 2.2. Unintentional Incidents
In addition to defending against intentional malicious attacks, control systems must also be prepared for unintentional security incidents caused by disgruntled employees, untrained users, and faulty software. These incidents can be just as dangerous, if not more so, than intentional attacks because they often originate from inside the control network from a trusted source. In 1999, a petroleum pipeline in Washington exploded, leading to the deaths of three people. The incident was caused by a failure in the control system that prevented the operator from relieving pressure on the pipe. Adherence to NIST standard 800-53 could have prevented this incident.

### 3. Possible Outcomes of an Attack
The effects of a successful attack on an industrial control system can vary depending on the system being controlled. A general control philosophy for protecting critical or potentially dangerous processes is to implement interlocks, which are either hardware or software logic designed to prevent equipment from operating in a way that could cause damage or create a dangerous situation. For example, a seatbelt interlock prevents the belt from extending when the brake is applied with a certain force. In many cases, the worst-case outcome of an attack is whatever occurs when one of these interlocks is broken. In the best-case scenario, after an attack is detected, it will be cleaned up, investigated, and the vulnerability will be closed.

#### 3.1. Equipment Failures
An incident could lead to expensive and potentially dangerous equipment failures. For instance, tampering with the algorithms that control the mixture of oxygen and fuel in a boiler could result in a fuel-rich mixture, potentially causing a large explosion. In a well-designed system, hardwired interlocks should prevent this, but they could be functioning incorrectly or disabled entirely. Another possible scenario involves disabling the Forced Draft (FD) fan while keeping the Induced Draft (ID) fan running, leading to a pressure imbalance that could cause a boiler implosion.

#### 3.2. Public Health Risks
Many modern plants use Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to decrease pollutants in emissions by injecting ammonia. If a weakness in the controls allows an attack to vent this gas, it could pose a serious public health risk to a large area around the plant. In 2007, a leaked government video demonstrated the "Aurora Generator Test," showing the violent destruction of a turbine generator due to an exploited vulnerability in the control system.

### 4. Governances and Standards
#### 4.1. NERC
Cybersecurity in industrial power plants, excluding nuclear, is governed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards. Non-compliance can result in fines of up to $1,000,000 per day per violation. The eight NERC CIP standards include:
- **CIP-002**: Critical Asset Identification
- **CIP-003**: Security Management Controls
- **CIP-004**: Personnel & Training
- **CIP-005**: Electronic Security Perimeters
- **CIP-006**: Physical Security of Critical Cyber Assets
- **CIP-007**: Systems Security Management
- **CIP-008**: Incident Reporting and Response Planning
- **CIP-009**: Recovery Plans for Critical Cyber Assets

#### 4.2. NIST
The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) created a set of standards managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). While adherence is not required for non-governmental organizations, the NIST guidelines are worth considering. Key NIST publications include:
- **FIPS Publication 199**: Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems
- **FIPS Publication 200**: Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information Technology Systems
- **Special Publication 800-30**: Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems
- **Special Publication 800-37**: Guide for Security Authorization of Federal Information Systems: A Security Lifecycle Approach
- **Special Publication 800-40**: Creating a Patch and Vulnerability Management System
- **Special Publication 800-53**: Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations
- **Special Publication 800-53A**: Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems
- **Special Publication 800-60**: Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories
- **Special Publication 800-82**: Guide to Industrial Control System Security

#### 4.3. NRC
Nuclear plants are exempt from NERC standards and are mandated by NRC Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations Section 73.54, requiring that their computer and communications systems be adequately protected against cyber attacks. The NRC released Regulatory Guide 5.71, which is based heavily on NIST publications 800-53 and 800-82.

### 5. Exceeding Compliance with Overlapping Standards
#### 5.1. Purpose
Achieving compliance in cybersecurity for industry is challenging, especially given the relative newness of the field. Most site personnel know little about cybersecurity, while IT/CS professionals often lack knowledge of industrial processes. This presents a significant challenge, as simply contracting IT professionals is not sufficient. It is better to aim for exceeding compliance rather than merely meeting it.

#### 5.2. Scope
This section provides a comprehensive security plan and techniques to help exceed compliance with multiple overlapping standards. The goal is to save on overhead in the near and long terms compared to manual, labor-intensive methods.

#### 5.3. Management Policies, Procedures & Lists
Compliance activities require documentation, records, and evidence. Documentation and records include drawings, configuration data, and backup drive images, while evidence includes sign-off sheets, original configuration scanner raw output, and backup image validation. This section provides recommended compliance procedures and details of what needs to be included in each.

##### 5.3.1. Master Lists
Three master lists are typically required for compliance:
- **Sites List**: Includes basic information about each site, such as name, location, address, type, peak load output, responsible organizations, and classification.
- **Systems List**: Provides details about each system, including site, system name, description, responsible party, and classification.
- **Cyber Devices List**: Includes programmable electronic devices whose primary programming interface is not implemented using a local non-electronic method. Fields include characteristic identifier/tag, unit, type, manufacturer, model, operating system, number of Ethernet ports, IP address, host name, equipment description, approximate location, and physical security.

### Conclusion
Industrial cybersecurity is a complex and evolving field. By understanding the threats, possible outcomes, and governing standards, and by aiming to exceed compliance, organizations can better protect their critical infrastructure and ensure the safety and reliability of their operations.
