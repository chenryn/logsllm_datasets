## Motivation
- **Where is End-to-End Voice Protection Over Cellular?**
- **Why Hasn’t It Become a Reality for the Average Consumer?**

## GSM Overview
- **GSM Cryptography**:
  - **A3**: Authentication algorithm for the GSM security model
  - **A5**: Stream cipher used for voice privacy
  - **A8**: Algorithm for voice-privacy key generation

### A5 Weaknesses
- Alex Biryukov, Adi Shamir, and David Wagner demonstrated breaking an A5/1 key in less than a second on a PC with 128 MB RAM.
- Elad Barkhan, Eli Biham, and Nathan Keller have shown a ciphertext-only attack against A5/2.

### Moral of the Story
- **GSM Cryptography provides limited, if any, true security to your voice channel. Something additional is needed.**

## The Need for Cellular Crypto
- **Cellular Phones Have Almost Completely Supplanted PSTN**:
  - Cellular companies do not provide any meaningful protection for voice traffic.
  - The ease of intercepting voice traffic is astounding, and people do it all the time.

### Two Major Classes of Intercepts
1. **Government-Perpetrated**:
   - Authorized and Unauthorized
   - Secret (FISA) and Reported
   - Local, State, and Federal
   - Not just your own government
   - Large portions of the telecom infrastructure in the USA are owned by foreign corporations, supported by foreign and possibly adversarial governments (e.g., Israel, China).

2. **Non-Government Perpetrated**:
   - Private Investigators
   - Business Partners
   - Economic Espionage

### Government Intercept
- **Most Common and Undetectable**:
  - CALEA Act allows intercepts to be executed remotely via the telecom provider directly.
  - “Untraceable” prepaid/disposable phones offer no protection if you exhibit the same calling pattern.
  - Presumably, high-level agencies (e.g., NRO, NSA) can perform voice matching as well.

### Data for Reported Intercepts
- In 2004:
  - 1,710 authorized intercepts
  - 1,507 targeted portable devices (cellular)

- **Trend Analysis**:
  - Cellular intercepts have doubled since 2000, suggesting that the ease of intercepts is driving growth.
  - No significant jump after September 11th implies FISA intercepts are used for terrorism-related intercepts.
  - The overall number of intercepts is likely orders of magnitude greater.

### GSM Spec TS 33.106
- **Interception Function**:
  - Should not alter the target’s service or provide indication to any party involved.
  - Output includes "Product" and/or "Network related data".
  - Network related data: location, type of call, all parties' numbers.
  - Product: speech, user data, fax, or SMS.

### Moral of the Story
- **Even if the GSM crypto sufficiently protected the handset-tower, network transit layers are capable of being intercepted. Only End-to-End crypto can provide sufficient security.**

## Current Market Offerings
- **Various GSM Crypto Products**:
  - Cryptophone G10
  - Sectera by General Dynamics (government contract)
  - Ancort Crypto Smart Phone
  - Several “vapor” products

### Future Narrowband Digital Terminal (FNBDT)
- **New US Government Standard for Secure Voice Communication**:
  - Requires a minimum bandwidth of 2400 Hz.
  - Replacement for STU-III
  - Uses MELP for voice compression.

### Problems with Current Products
- **Use of GSM Circuit Switched Data (CSD) Channel**:
  - Not part of the normal consumer-level package in all places.
  - CSD is being replaced by packet-switched services, which currently lack the necessary performance for quality voice links.
  - Long call setup times
  - High latency, though not as bad as GPRS

- **CSD is Meant for Data, Not Voice**:
  - Voice can tolerate more transmission errors and does not require ARQ.
  - High latency and retransmission make the data channel insufficient for voice.

- **Availability and Cost**:
  - Some products are only available for government or government contractor use, or are very expensive.
  - The solution needs to be available to everyone.

### Proposed Solution
- **Develop a Modem That Works Over the GSM Voice Channel**:
  - Latency optimized
  - Frame dropping
  - A fun and challenging technical problem to solve as a side benefit.

## Technical Details of the GSM Voice Channel
- **Properties**:
  - Low latency
  - High availability
  - Friendly billing system from service providers (use standard voice minutes instead of more expensive data packages).
  - Forgiving only for speech-like waveforms.

### Voice Packet Structure

  - Class B/C bits: sent uncoded
  - Class A bits are most important for intelligible voice.

  - ITU V.34: 33600 bps, 3429 baud, TCM, 1800 Hz
  - ITU V.92: 53000 bps, 8000 PCM, N/A

### 56 kbps Modem Description
- **V.90 Uses PCM (Pulse Coded Modulation)**:
  - Bits are sent from the transmitting modem over the digital telephone network to a receiving modem at the telco office.
  - Converted to analog voltage levels that are sent over the analog wire to your modem.
  - Voltages held on the line for 125 microseconds (8000 per second).
  - 8 bits per pulse equals 64 kbps, but North American networks use 7 bits = 56 kbps.
