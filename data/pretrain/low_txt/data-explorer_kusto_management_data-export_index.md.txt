# Data Export

Data export in Azure Data Explorer involves executing a Kusto query and saving its results. This process can be performed either on the client side or the service side. For examples and more information, see [Related Content](#related-content).

## Client-Side Export

Client-side export allows you to save query results to the local file system or push them to a preferred storage location. This flexibility is enabled through the use of [Kusto client libraries](../../api/client-libraries.md). You can create an application to run queries, read the desired data, and implement an export process tailored to your specific requirements.

Alternatively, you can use a client tool such as the Azure Data Explorer web UI to export data from your Kusto cluster. For more information, see [Share Queries](../../../web-share-queries.md).

## Service-Side Export (Pull)

To pull query results into a table within the same or a different cluster, use the [ingest from query](../../management/data-ingestion/ingest-from-query.md) commands. Before using these commands, review the [performance tips](../../management/data-ingestion/ingest-from-query.md#performance-tips) to ensure optimal performance.

## Service-Side Export (Push)

For scalable data export, Azure Data Explorer provides various `.export` management commands to push query results to [cloud storage](export-data-to-storage.md), an [external table](export-data-to-an-external-table.md), or an [SQL table](export-data-to-sql.md). This approach enhances scalability by avoiding the bottleneck of streaming through a single network connection.

[Continuous data export](continuous-data-export.md) is supported for exporting to external tables.

> [!NOTE]
> The `.export` management commands are limited by the available data export capacity of your cluster. Use the [.show capacity command](../../management/diagnostics.md#show-capacity) to view the total, consumed, and remaining data export capacity.
