  - [More details](http://www.ohgizmo.com/2005/08/02/the-firefly-disposable-ballistic-camera/)
  - 8 seconds of video.
  - 600-meter range.
  - Fin-stabilized with spring-out wings for extended range.
  - Launched from a 40mm grenade launcher (must be registered as a Destructive Device, approximately $2k).
  - Military use only; not available to most civilians.
  - Deployment time is quick, a few seconds.
  - Uses standard military equipment (40mm grenade launcher).
  - Ballistic decommission: Shatters at the end of flight.

## DIY Ballistic Camera
- **Civilians' Access**
- **Cost Considerations**
- **DIY/MAKE Spirit**
- **Search and Rescue Applications**
- **Airsoft Enthusiasts**
- **Just Because!**

### Safety
- **DIY Destructive Devices can go wrong. VERY WRONG!**
- If you ever hear someone with a grenade launcher say, “Hey, y’all, someone hold my beer! Now watch this!!” RUN!

#### Safety Warnings
- **WARNING! DO NOT DO THIS AT HOME!**
- Do not disassemble 37mm or 40mm shells.
- We are experts. Please do not attempt this yourself.
- If you have questions, contact us to discuss the possible dangers.

#### Hand Orientation
- Right hand on pistol grip.
- Left hand BEHIND the shell, not on the 'hand guard'.

#### Protective Gear
- Fragmentation Vest
- Flash Suit
- Gloves
- Helmet
- Eye Protection
- Ear Protection
- No such thing as overkill when it comes to protecting your fingers and eyeballs.

### Legality
- **37mm vs. 40mm**
- **Non-DD vs. Destructive Device**
- **NFA 1934**
- **¼ Ounce of Explosive/Propellant/Lift Charge**
- **PC 120301(a)(4)** (Penal Code: $200,000 fine + jail time)

### Capability of 37mm Non-DD
- ½ lb projectile with 400 meters range.
- ¼ lb with 400 feet vertical range.
- 25,000 PSI in high-pressure chamber.

### Why Our System is Not DD
- Total weight of lift charge/payload.
- Intent: Signal, Search and Rescue.
- Non-antipersonnel.
- 37mm.
- Never aim at individuals.

### System Configuration
- **Launcher Variants**
  - Low Pressure Device (only 25,000 PSI)
  - 26.5mm
  - 37mm
  - 40mm
  - Modular
  - Blank Round
  - Standalone
  - Under-barrel
  - 6 shot/8 shot
  - Automatic
  - Corner Shot

### Design
- Trial and Error
- Individual Component Testing
- Camera
- Command Center Recorder
- Field Recorder
- Power Source
- Payload Capsule/Recovery System
- Launcher Shell
  - Metal Film Canister
  - Nalgene Micro Bottle
  - Plastic Film Canister

### System Capabilities
- 600-meter vertical shot.
- Fire over 5-story buildings for urban search and rescue.
- 400-meter horizontal range.
- 22 seconds of video from 140 meters altitude.
- 30 minutes of on-station time if tangled in trees via chute or tangle lines.
- Punch through ¼-inch plywood and remain on-station.
- Punch through plate glass and remain on-station.
