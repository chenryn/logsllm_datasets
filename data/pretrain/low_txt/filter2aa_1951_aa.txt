## Background

### Malware and Physical Harm: Some Examples

- **Digital/Physical Malware**:
  - Stuxnet, Mirai, Mirsky et al. (2019)
- **Malware Affecting Physical Equipment**:
  - Conficker, WannaCry
- **Medical Implant Vulnerabilities**:
  - Halperin et al. (2008); Rushanan et al. (2014); Williams & Woodward (2015); Rios & Butts (2019)
- **Vehicle Vulnerabilities**:
  - Othmane et al. (2013); Valasek & Miller (2015)

### Malware and Harm: Effects

- **Indirect Relationship**: Typically, there's an indirect relationship between malware and physical harm.
- **Direct Human Impact**:
  - Poulsen (2008); Oluwafemi et al. (2013); Ronen & Shamir (2016); Rios & Butts (2017)

### Sound as a Weapon

- **Decibel Exposure Time Guidelines**: [Source](http://dangerousdecibels.org/education/information-center/decibel-exposure-time-guidelines/)
- **Sound Intensity Comparison**:
  - Floor fan, lawn mower, chainsaw, jet taking off, Windows XP start-up sound [Source](https://survivallife.com/sound-as-a-weapon-pt-2/)

### What Can We Hear?

- **Ultrasound & Infrasound**:
  - Above/below human hearing threshold (typically 20Hz – 20kHz, Durrant & Lovrinic, 1995)
  - Misconception: Thresholds vary widely
- **This Talk**:
  - High-Frequency Noise (HFN): 17 - 21kHz
  - Low-Frequency Noise (LFN): 60 - 100Hz

### Imperceptibility

- **Definition Issues**:
  - Basing definitions on lack of a property is problematic (Duck & Leighton, 2018)
  - Perceptibility is not a case of arbitrary cut-off points
  - Mechanisms not fully understood (Koch, 2017)
  - Significant variation in thresholds (Leighton, 2018; Leventhall et al., 2003; van Wieringen & Glorieux, 2018)
- **Factors Affecting Perception**:
  - Volume, background noise, previous exposure
  - Sound may be perceived as vibration (Leventhall et al., 2003)
  - Audible 'subharmonics' (Ashihara et al., 2006; Howard et al., 2005)
  - Likelihood declines non-linearly (Muhlhans, 2017)
  - HFN threshold increases with age (Macca et al., 2015; van Wierengen & Glorieux, 2018)

### Adverse Physiological and Psychological Effects

- **High-Frequency Noise (HFN)**:
  - Susceptibility varies (Leighton, 2016; Qibai & Shi, 2004)
  - Adverse effects on hearing (Duck & Leighton, 2018)
  - Temporary threshold shifts (Acton and Carson, 1967)
  - Reduction in hearing sensitivity (Chopra et al., 2016; Grzesik & Pluta, 1986; Macca et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2002)
  - Neurasthenia, cardiac neurosis, hypotension, bradycardia, functional changes in CV and CNS (Smagowska & Pawlaczyk-Łuszczy´nska, 2013)
- **Psychological Effects**:
  - Nausea, fatigue, headaches (Duck & Leighton, 2018; Howard et al., 2005; Von Gierke & Nixon, 1992)
  - Tinnitus and ear pain (Chopra et al., 2016; Fletcher et al., 2018a)
  - Irritation (Ueda et al., 2014)
  - Somnolence, dizziness, palpitations, decreased concentration (Smagowska & Pawlaczyk-Łuszczy´nska, 2013)

- **Low-Frequency Noise (LFN)**:
  - Temporary threshold shifts (Leventhall et al., 2003)
  - Correlation with heart ailments, chronic insomnia (Mirowska & Mroz, 2000)
  - Elevated cortisol levels (Bengtsson, 2003)
- **Psychological Effects**:
  - Annoyance (Pawlaczyk-łuszczy´nska et al., 2005; Persson & Rylander, 1988; Storm, 2009)
  - Headaches and palpitations (Møller & Lydolf, 2002)
  - Deterioration in performance and productivity (Bengtsson, 2003; Benignus et al., 1975; Kaczmarska & Łuczak, 2007)
  - Lower levels of cooperation and agreeableness (Waye et al., 1997)
  - Depressive symptoms and distress (Stansfeld & Shipley, 2015)
  - Even at very moderate levels (40-45dBA) (Bengtsson, 2003; Persson & Bjorkman, 1988; Waye et al., 1997)

### Caveats

- **Data Limitations**:
  - Sparse and anecdotal (Leighton, 2018)
  - Easily misinterpreted (Duck & Leighton, 2018)
  - Detailed knowledge of "noise dose" not always present (Andringa & Lanser, 2013; Donder et al., 2018)
  - Many effects not reproducible in labs (Fletcher et al., 2018b)
  - Ethical restrictions (Fletcher et al., 2018a, 2018b; Leighton, 2018)
  - Possible "nocebo" effect
  - Significant base for adverse effects in a subset of the population

### Exposure Guidelines

- **High-Frequency Noise (HFN)**:
  - Significant differences in methodology and implementation
  - Mostly in occupational context
  - Often based on small samples, primarily adult males (Leighton, 2018)
  - Consensus that A-weighting is inappropriate (Lawton, 2001; Leighton, 2018)
  - SPL re 20 μPa is commonly used
  - Z-weighting (flat frequency response from 10Hz – 20kHz, no attenuation for sounds above/below 'audible range')

- **Low-Frequency Noise (LFN)**:
  - Fewer guidelines exist
  - Primary effects are subjective at moderate levels
  - Methodology differs significantly
  - Reference curve proposed by Defra (Moorhouse et al., 2011)
  - G-weighting (ISO 7196:1995) commonly used for 1Hz - 20Hz, but not LFN (Koch, 2017)

### Previous Work

- **Covert Communications Channels (HFN)**:
  - Mobile devices (Deshotels, 2014)
  - Covert mesh networks (Hanspach & Goetz, 2014)
  - Dreadphone/Spectregram (Wixey, 2017)
  - Many consumer devices capable of emitting HFN (Filonenko et al., 2010)
- **Disruption of Echolocation Systems**:
  - Ultrasonic altimeters on drones (Wixey, 2017)
  - Tesla vehicles (Yan et al., 2016)
- **Corruption of Data**:
  - Blue Note (Bolton et al., 2018)
- **Ultrasonic Tracking Beacons**:
  - For targeted marketing
