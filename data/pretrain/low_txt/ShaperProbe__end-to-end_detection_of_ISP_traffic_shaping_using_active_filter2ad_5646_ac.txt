### Smaller ISP B that Deploys Shaping (While A Does Not)

We cannot distinguish between ISPs A and B based on BGP prefix-to-ASN mapping. In the following sections, we will examine some of these factors in ISP case studies. Some ISPs disclose their traffic shaping configurations, allowing us to validate our observations.

### 4.1 Case Study: Comcast

Comcast offers Internet connectivity to both residential and enterprise customers [5, 3] and uses two types of access technologies: cable (DOCSIS 3.0) and Ethernet. Within each access category, Comcast provides multiple service tiers. The company employs PowerBoost technology for traffic shaping [4].

#### Shaping Profiles

Between October 2009 and May 2011, we observed various shaping configurations at Comcast. Figure 4 illustrates the shaping configuration for each run, ordered by capacity. For each run, identified by an "ID," we plot two points in the top panel for the capacity and the shaping rate, and a point in the bottom panel for the burst size. The capacities form an envelope around the shaping rate points. Our data reveal strong modes, summarized in Table 2. For higher capacities, there are more modes in the shaping rate. However, at the tail of the capacity distribution, only one shaping rate corresponds to the highest service tier provided by Comcast. We verified our observations with the Comcast website listings [3, 5]. Note that we may not observe all service tiers, depending on the number of ShaperProbe users at each tier. Additionally, we observed two or three burst sizes used across all tiers; the PowerBoost FAQ mentions 10MB and 5MB burst sizes [4].

**Figure 4: Comcast: Shaping Characteristics**

- **Upstream**
  - Capacity: 0 to 16,000 Kbps
  - Shaping Rate: 0 to 16,000 Kbps
  - Burst Size: 0 to 25,000 KB

- **Downstream**
  - Capacity: 0 to 80,000 Kbps
  - Shaping Rate: 0 to 30,000 Kbps
  - Burst Size: 0 to 25,000 KB

**Run ID:**
- (a) Upstream
- (b) Downstream

**Figure 5: Comcast: Histogram of Bandwidth Over Time**

- **Upstream**
  - Capacity: 0 to 20,000 Kbps
  - Shaping Rate: 0 to 20,000 Kbps

- **Downstream**
  - Capacity: 0 to 90,000 Kbps
  - Shaping Rate: 0 to 60,000 Kbps

**Note:** The capacity curves do not show strong modes, unlike the shaping rates. This is due to the underlying DOCSIS access technology. The cable modem uplink is a non-FIFO scheduler, and the capacity can vary depending on the activity of other nodes at the CMTS. A DOCSIS downlink can also influence the dispersion-based capacity estimates under heavy traffic load conditions because it is a broadcast link.

**Did Shaping Configurations Change During the Last Two Years?**

We compared data from Comcast collected in October 2009-March 2010 and in March-May 2011. Figure 5 shows estimates of the capacity and shaping rate distributions using a Gaussian kernel density estimator. In the upstream direction, the capacity and shaping rates (the modes of the corresponding distributions) have not changed significantly. The downstream links show a new capacity mode of 30 Mbps and a shaping rate mode of 22 Mbps in 2011. We did not find significant changes in the burst size over the last two years.

**Non-Shaped Runs**

We examined runs in which ShaperProbe did not detect shaping. Figure 6 compares the capacity distribution in such runs with the shaping rate distribution in shaped runs. The non-shaped capacity distributions are similar to the shaping rate distributions. Non-shaping runs occur for two reasons: 
1. Comcast provides service tiers that do not include PowerBoost but have capacities similar to PowerBoost service tiers (e.g., the Ethernet 1Mbps and 10Mbps business service).
2. Cross traffic may result in an empty token bucket at the start of the measurement, causing the capacity estimated by ShaperProbe to equal the shaping rate, and thus no shaping is detected.

**Figure 6: Comcast: Distribution of Capacities in Non-Shaping and Shaping Rate in Shaping Runs**

- **Capacity (Kbps):** 0 to 60,000 Kbps
- **Shaping Rate (Kbps):** 0 to 60,000 Kbps

### 4.2 Case Studies: Road Runner and Cox

**Road Runner (RR)**

Road Runner is a cable ISP. A unique aspect of RR is that we found evidence of downstream shaping but no evidence of upstream shaping in any service tier on their web pages. ShaperProbe measurements support this observation: 94% of the upstream runs did not detect shaping, while 64% of the downstream runs did. Another interesting aspect is that shaping depends on the geographic region of the customer. For example, in Texas, RR provides four service tiers: the lower two are not shaped, while the upper two are shaped [10]. Assuming RR does not shape upstream traffic, our false positive detection rate for their upstream links is about 6.4%. The capacity distribution of non-shaped RR runs shows that, unlike Comcast, the downstream capacity mode of 750 Kbps is not equal to any of their shaping modes (figure omitted due to space constraints; see [17]).

**Cox**

Cox provides residential and business Internet access using cable and Ethernet. The website [7] mentions that the residential shaping rates and capacities depend on the customer's location. We gathered residential shaping configurations from the residential pages [7]. The upstream shaping properties of Cox runs in Figure 7 agree with some of the ground truth information we found: (C, œÅ) Mbps: (1, 0.77), (1.3, 1), (2, 1.5), (2.5, 1), (2.5, 2), (3, 2), (3.5, 3), (5, 4), and (5.5, 5). Note that the previous ground truth was collected in October 2010, while the ShaperProbe data covers two years. We also found a single burst size mode.

**Figure 7: Cox: Upstream Shaping**

- **Capacity (Kbps):** 0 to 9,000 Kbps
- **Shaping Rate (Kbps):** 0 to 5,000 Kbps

### 4.3 Case Study: AT&T

Our final case study is an ISP for which we do not frequently detect shaping (10% or less). AT&T provides Internet access to a wide range of customers, from homes and small businesses to enterprises (including other ISPs). Their residential service includes four DSL service tiers [1, 2]. We did not find any mention of traffic shaping in the AT&T service descriptions [1, 2].

**Capacity**

First, we look at the 90% of the runs that did not see shaping. The capacity distribution of non-shaped runs is shown in Figure 8. Given the point-to-point nature of DSL links, ShaperProbe estimates the narrow link capacity more accurately than in cable links. The capacity distributions show several modes: {330 Kbps, 650 Kbps, 1 Mbps, 1.5 Mbps} upstream, and {1 Mbps, 2.5 Mbps, 5 Mbps, 6 Mbps, 11 Mbps, 18 Mbps} downstream. We did not observe significant changes in the capacity modes between 2009-2011.

**Shaping Runs**

We look at the 10% of AT&T runs that were probably mis-diagnosed as shaping. We found that about a third of these runs exhibit strong shaping rate modes.

**Figure 8: AT&T: Capacity Distribution of Non-Shaped Runs**

- **Capacity (Kbps):** 0 to 18,000 Kbps

This concludes our case studies, providing insights into the traffic shaping practices of different ISPs.
