## 📝 Support for Transparent Backgrounds on SVG Explorer Icons and Previews

When viewing an SVG image with a transparent background in the file explorer, the explorer should not fill the transparent areas of the icon with a solid white color. Instead, it should display the SVG icon in the same way it displays a PNG image with a transparent background.
