To configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) on a Windows Server, follow these detailed steps:

1. **Open Server Manager**: Start by opening the "Server Manager" application. You can do this by searching for it in the Start menu or through the Administrative Tools.

2. **Add Roles and Features**:
   - In the left-hand navigation bar of Server Manager, click on “Manage” and then select “Add Roles and Features”. This initiates the Add Roles and Features Wizard.
   
3. **Role-Based Installation**:
   - On the “Before you begin” screen, click “Next”.
   - Choose “Role-based or feature-based installation” as your installation type, and click “Next”.

4. **Select Destination Server**:
   - Select the server from the list where you wish to install AD DS, and click “Next”.

5. **Choose Server Roles**:
   - On the “Server Roles” page, check the box next to “Active Directory Domain Services”. A dialog box will appear with some additional information; read it and click “Add Features” if prompted, then click “Next”.

6. **Features Confirmation**:
   - The wizard will now show you a list of features that are required for AD DS. Review them and click “Next”.

7. **Review and Install**:
   - Confirm your selections on the “Confirm installation selections” page, and then click “Install” to begin the installation process.
   - Wait for the installation to complete. Once finished, click “Close” to exit the wizard.

8. **Post-Installation Configuration**:
   - After the installation is complete, you need to promote the server to a domain controller. To do this, open the “Notification Flags” pane in Server Manager, and click the link to promote the server to a domain controller.
   - Follow the prompts in the Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard to set up the domain, including specifying the domain name, forest type, and other necessary details.
   - Set the Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password, which is used to log on to the server in case of a directory service failure.
   - Review the summary of your selections and click “Next” to start the configuration process.
   - The system will prompt you to restart the server to complete the promotion. Click “Restart” when prompted.

9. **Verify the Installation**:
   - After the server has restarted, log back in and verify that the AD DS role is installed and functioning correctly.
   - Use tools like “Active Directory Users and Computers” to manage and maintain the domain.

By following these steps, you will have successfully configured Active Directory Domain Services on your Windows Server.
