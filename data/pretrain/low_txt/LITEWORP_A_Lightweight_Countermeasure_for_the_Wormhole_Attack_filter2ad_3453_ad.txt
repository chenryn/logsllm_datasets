### 6. Simulation Results

We utilized the ns-2 simulation environment [34] to evaluate a data exchange protocol, both in a baseline scenario without any protection and with LITEWORP. Nodes were randomly distributed over a square field with a fixed average node density, resulting in varying field sizes (80×80 m to 204×204 m) depending on the number of nodes. We employed a generic on-demand shortest path routing that floods route requests and unicasts route replies in the reverse direction. Once established, routes are not permanent but are evicted from the cache after a timeout period (TOutRoute).

When a malicious node intercepts a route request, it redirects the request to all other malicious nodes in the network using either an out-of-band channel or packet encapsulation. For packet encapsulation, we assumed that colluding nodes always have a route between them. The out-of-band channel was simulated by allowing compromised nodes to deliver packets instantaneously to their colluding parties. These two schemes highlight the primary feature of LITEWORP, which is local monitoring, and represent the most challenging scenarios to mitigate. Therefore, we prioritized simulating these attack modes.

Upon establishing a wormhole, the malicious nodes at each end discard all packets forwarded to them.

Each node acts as a data source, generating data using an exponential random distribution with an inter-arrival rate of \( m \). The destination is chosen randomly and changes according to an exponential random distribution with rate \( x \). The input parameters and their experimental values are provided in Table 2. The output parameters include isolation latency, the number of data packets dropped due to the wormhole, the number of routes established, and the number of routes affected by the wormhole. The simulation also accounts for losses due to natural collisions. Isolation latency is calculated from the time a malicious node initiates a wormhole attack until it is completely isolated by all its neighbors. The guards inform all neighbors of the detected malicious node through multiple unicasts. The presented output parameters are averaged over 30 runs, with malicious nodes chosen randomly such that they are more than 2 hops away from each other.

**Table 2: Input Parameter Values for LITEWORP Simulations**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total # nodes (N) | 2-8 |
| \( x \) | 1/10 sec |
| Channel BW | 40 kbps |
| \( T \) | 0.5 sec |

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Tx Range (r) | 30 m |
| \( NB \) | 8 |
| TOutRoute | 50 sec |
| \( b \) | 5 |

**Figure 8** illustrates the number of packets dropped as a function of simulation time for a 100-node setup with 2 and 4 colluding nodes, both with and without LITEWORP. The attack begins 50 seconds after the simulation starts. Due to the significant difference in the number of dropped packets between the two cases, separate Y-axes are used; the left axis corresponds to the baseline case, and the right axis to the system using LITEWORP. In the baseline case, the cumulative number of dropped packets continues to increase steadily over time because wormholes are not detected and isolated. In contrast, with LITEWORP, the cumulative number stabilizes as wormholes are identified and permanently isolated. Note that the cumulative number of dropped packets still increases for some time after the wormhole is locally isolated at 75 seconds due to cached routes containing the wormhole, which continue to be used until the route timeout occurs.

**Figure 9** provides a snapshot at 2000 seconds of the fraction of total packets dropped and the fraction of total routes involving wormholes, for 0-4 compromised nodes in both the baseline and LITEWORP scenarios. With 0 or 1 compromised node, there is no adverse effect on normal traffic since no wormhole is created. The relationship between the number of dropped packets and the number of malicious routes is non-linear, as the route established through the wormhole is more heavily used by data sources due to the aggressive nature of the malicious nodes. Over time, with LITEWORP, these parameters tend to zero as no more malicious routes are established or packets dropped, while without LITEWORP, they reach a steady state as a fixed percentage of traffic continues to be affected by undetected wormholes.

**Figure 10** validates the analytical results for detection probability as \( \gamma \) varies, with \( NB = 15 \) and \( M = 2 \). As \( \gamma \) increases, the detection probability decreases due to the need for alarm reporting by a larger number of guards in the presence of collisions. Additionally, the isolation latency increases, though it remains small (less than 30 seconds) even at the right end of the plot.

### 7. Conclusion and Future Work

We propose to extend LITEWORP to mobile ad-hoc and sensor networks. The fundamental requirement is the ability of a node to securely determine its first and second hop neighbors in the face of mobility. We can augment LITEWORP with existing work on dynamic secure neighborhood determination protocols, e.g., [15], [16], to achieve this goal in static networks. However, we are also investigating an alternate design of LITEWORP that is customized for mobile networks.

In this paper, we presented a taxonomy for attack modes used to launch wormhole attacks in multi-hop wireless networks. We introduced LITEWORP, a protocol that incorporates detection and isolation mechanisms. The detection protocol can identify various modes of wormhole attacks, except for protocol deviation. The core mechanism is local monitoring, where a node monitors traffic in and out of its neighboring nodes using a data structure of first and second hop neighbors. LITEWORP isolates malicious nodes and removes their ability to cause future damage. The coverage analysis of LITEWORP shows the variation in the probability of missed and false detection with increasing network density. The cost analysis indicates that LITEWORP has low storage, processing, and bandwidth requirements, making it ideal for resource-constrained wireless networks like sensor networks.
