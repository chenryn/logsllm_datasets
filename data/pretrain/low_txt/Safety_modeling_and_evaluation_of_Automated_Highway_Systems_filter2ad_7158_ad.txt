### System Unsafety and Its Dependencies

System unsafety is influenced by the number of vehicles in each platoon that could be affected by failures. This number, in turn, depends on the rates at which vehicles join and leave the platoon. To better understand the combined impact of these rates, we analyze the evolution of system unsafety as a function of the system load, defined as the ratio of the join rate to the leave rate.

**Figure 11: S(t) versus Time for Different Join and Leave Rates**
- **Parameters:** 
  - Number of vehicles per platoon, \( n = 10 \)
  - Join rate = 12/hr
  - Leave rate = 4/hr

**Figure 12: Impact of Failure Rate on System Unsafety**
- **Parameters:**
  - Maximum number of vehicles per platoon, \( n \), increases from 10 to 18
  - Trip duration = 6 hours
- **Observation:**
  - The failure rate has a more significant impact when the number of vehicles per platoon is smaller.

**Figure 13: S(t) versus Trip Duration for Different Join and Leave Rates**
- **Parameters:**
  - Failure rate, \( \lambda = 10^{-5} \)/hr
  - Number of vehicles per platoon, \( n = 8 \)
- **Observation:**
  - Similar trends are observed for all curves corresponding to the same failure rate, with the highest unsafety observed for the highest join rate.
  - Comparing results for different values of \( \lambda \) and a fixed leave rate, the highest value of \( \lambda \) leads to the highest level of unsafety, although the results are of the same order of magnitude.

### Influence of Coordination Strategy

The results presented in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 correspond to a decentralized inter- and intra-platoon coordination strategy (DD). Figure 14 compares the unsafety for four strategies:
- **DD (Decentralized inter- and intra-platoon)**
- **DC (Decentralized inter-platoon and Centralized intra-platoon)**
- **CD (Centralized inter-platoon and Decentralized intra-platoon)**
- **CC (Centralized inter- and intra-platoon)**

**Figure 14: S(t) versus Trip Duration for Different Coordination Strategies**
- **Parameters:**
  - Number of vehicles per platoon, \( n = 10 \)
  - Failure rate, \( \lambda = 10^{-5} \)/hr
  - Join rate = 12/hr
  - Leave rate = 4/hr
- **Observation:**
  - The inter-platoon strategy has a more significant impact than the intra-platoon strategy, with higher safety observed for the decentralized inter-platoon strategy. This is due to the fact that more vehicles are involved in the centralized inter-platoon coordination (see Section 2.2.1).

**Figure 15: S(t) at t=6hrs versus n**
- **Parameters:**
  - Failure rate, \( \lambda = 10^{-5} \)/hr
  - Join rate = 12/hr
  - Leave rate = 4/hr
- **Observation:**
  - The impact of the coordination strategy is low even for higher values of \( n \).

### Conclusion and Future Work

The work and results presented in this paper serve as a preliminary step in evaluating the safety of automated highway systems. The results provide initial indications about:
1. The optimal size of platoons.
2. The maximum trip duration.
3. The most suitable coordination strategy for better safety.

Future work will focus on analyzing how to control these factors in an operational context. For the parameters considered in our study, the size of the platoons should not exceed 10, which is consistent with experimental tests reported in [10].

The models presented can be extended to analyze highways with a larger number of platoons and more complex scenarios. Further work is planned to evaluate other collaborative driving systems using, for example, the concept of teamwork for platoon formations [16].
