**Title: Botconf2022 MWDB: Open Source Tools to Build Your Malware Analysis Pipeline**

Over the past decade, our team at CERT.pl has experimented with numerous approaches to malware analysis. While many of these methods did not succeed, they provided us with invaluable insights into what works and what doesn't. After several years of development, we are proud to present a comprehensive, open-source malware repository and analysis platform. This workshop will offer a practical, hands-on introduction to all aspects of the platform:

- **MWDB**: A community-based online service for the analysis and sharing of malware samples. This service is freely available to white-hat researchers and provides fully-automated malware extraction and botnet tracking.
  
- **MWDB Core**: A self-hosted repository for storing malware samples and related technical information, such as malware configurations.

- **Karton**: A microservice framework designed for highly scalable and fault-resistant malware analysis workflows. We will cover the installation and configuration of Karton, and then focus on adapting workflows to the Karton framework.

- **Malduck**: Our library for malware extraction and analysis. We will demonstrate how to use Malduck effectively and guide you through creating your own custom modules.

All components of this platform are available on our GitHub page. Join us to learn how to leverage these tools to build a robust and efficient malware analysis pipeline.
