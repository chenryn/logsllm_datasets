### Encouraging Secure and Anonymous Communication

To ensure security, users should employ a standard encryption algorithm and publish only the ciphertexts. To prevent the association of multiple ciphertexts with a single origin, it is advisable to connect to the network through an anonymizing overlay, such as Tor [23], using a distinct circuit for each update.

### Promoting Honest Identity Generation

As discussed in Section 6, our security model holds when rational users generate their identities honestly, leading to random rather than adversarially chosen storage assignments. To achieve this, we propose incorporating a proof-of-work mechanism into the identity generation process, thereby increasing the cost of selective identity generation.

### Encouraging Diverse Storage Utilization

While we have set the per-identity storage requirement in Permacoin low enough for ordinary users to participate, many users may purchase additional storage devices to compete more effectively. We aim to incentivize the storage of diverse data segments rather than multiple copies of the same segment, thus enhancing the diversity of stored data. Achieving this while maintaining the linearity of expected rewards is challenging. Our approach is to suggest that the behavior of Bitcoin participants may be better explained by prospect theory [24] rather than expected utility. Participation in our scheme resembles participation in state lottery gambles (hence the term "scratch-off lottery puzzle"). Evidence from the Powerball lottery indicates that wealthier individuals are more likely to participate in lotteries with higher variance and larger jackpots [25]. Using this as a heuristic, we propose that participants who can afford multiple storage devices may prefer a puzzle lottery with higher difficulty (i.e., higher variance) and a correspondingly larger reward, even if the expected value remains the same.

### A Weaker Trusted Dealer Assumption

In practice, the trusted dealer in Permacoin would be replaced by the network's functionality. While our scheme incentivizes file storage, there is no inherent incentive for distributing files to other users. However, even a small fraction of altruistic users could form an effective distribution network by voluntarily sharing segments, thereby offsetting the storage costs. This is similar to how Bitcoin operates, where the network distributes historical data to new users despite the mining incentives not being directly related to this function.

### Overall Impact

What would be the gains if Permacoin were fully successful, either as a modification to Bitcoin or as an independent system surpassing Bitcoin, similar to how Facebook surpassed MySpace in the 2000s? In the previous section, we estimated the storage capacity of the network if Permacoin had been used instead of Bitcoin from the beginning. The key difference is that the current hardware investment in Bitcoin has already been made. At best, Permacoin can lead to better utilization of future equipment investments in Bitcoin-like systems. Notably, the hashpower of the Bitcoin network has grown steadily since its inception, doubling every two months between March 2013 and March 2014 [7]. If this growth continues, repurposing the additional investment will yield significant benefits.

Although Permacoin recovers additional benefits from mining hardware used to maintain the currency, the performance of the storage service is inferior to typical cloud storage. Large data centers benefit from economies of scale, saving on bulk power and cooling costs. Even Amazon Glacier, which closely matches our operating points (cheap to store, expensive to recover), is much cheaper per gigabyte and offers similar features like geographic replication of data. However, Permacoin provides greater geographic diversity and, more importantly, dispersion across more administrative domains. Full decentralization, a key design goal in Bitcoin, is also a core feature of our approach to data preservation.

### Related Work

Permacoin spans three main areas of literature: Proofs of Storage (PORs), Bitcoin, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) File Systems and Incentives.

#### Proofs of Storage
There is extensive literature on PORs. The original construction [5] has been followed by various variants, including those with improved efficiency [26, 27], public verifiability [5, 27], distributed versions [10], and, most recently, the ability to support file systems rather than static files [21]. A related area, Proofs of Data Possession (PDPs) [28], considers proofs that most, but not necessarily all, of a file is stored. Unlike PDPs, PORs support extraction, allowing file recovery through the challenge-response interface. We do not use extraction in our proposal.

#### Bitcoin
A purely digital implementation of money has been a sought-after goal since the development of blind signatures by Chaum in 1982 [29]. Previous attempts, such as [30], awarded monetary value to computational work but required an external timestamp service to process transactions sequentially. Bitcoin [2] innovatively relates transaction commitment to Byzantine consensus in a public P2P network, using computational puzzles to overcome the lack of pre-established identities [31]. The result is a computationally expensive yet highly participatory system that tolerates substantial misbehavior without relying on strong identities. The economic assumptions underlying Bitcoin are not yet fully understood. When computational resources are equally allocated among individuals, cooperation according to Bitcoin’s reference implementation is a Nash equilibrium, though not a unique one [13]. If an individual or coalition controls a third or more of the overall power, deviating from the protocol becomes more profitable [12]. Various Bitcoin variations, such as Litecoin, use different puzzle schemes to alter the incentive structure, encouraging participation with commodity rather than customized hardware. Our proposal is among the first for puzzles with beneficial side effects. Primecoin [32] generates Cunningham chains of prime numbers, though these have no known uses and the puzzle scheme is not proven to satisfy any security definition. The "proof-of-stake" [33] technique aims to eliminate computational work entirely, potentially offering even greater benefits, though the security trade-offs are still unclear.

#### P2P File Systems and Incentives
Since 2000, there has been substantial research on P2P systems for persistent data storage [8, 34], using distributed-hash-table routing techniques (e.g., Pastry [35]). Popular systems reward users for contributing resources to the network, often based on reciprocation to prevent free-riding. For example, BitTorrent [7] users who contribute upstream bandwidth are rewarded with faster downloads. P2P document backup systems [36] involve users swapping contracts to store copies of others' files.

Our P2P storage system in Permacoin differs in two main ways. First, the entire target archive is replicated throughout the global network, rather than among a small group of peers, maximizing the probability of file recovery and making it suitable for data of great public significance. Second, the high cost of global redundancy is offset by recycling computational resources already consumed on the Bitcoin network.

### Conclusion

We have presented Permacoin, a modification to Bitcoin that recycles the substantial investment in computational resources for a useful auxiliary purpose. By replacing Bitcoin's computational SOP with one based on Proofs-of-Retrievability, we ensure that participants must locally store diverse portions of a large dataset, ensuring full data recovery with high probability. Our analysis shows that the system is feasible, preserving Bitcoin's essential incentive structures with minimal overhead. Given the size of the existing Bitcoin network, we estimate that our scheme could recycle enough resources to store at least a "Library of Congress" worth of data (i.e., 200 terabytes) in a globally distributed network.
