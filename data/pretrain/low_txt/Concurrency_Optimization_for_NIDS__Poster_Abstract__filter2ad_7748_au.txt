### P-111: Targeted Metabolomics Reveals Training Level-Specific Metabolic Adaptations in Marathon Race Athletes

**Presenting Author:** Mark Haid, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Molecular Endocrinology and Metabolism, Germany

**Co-Authors:** Jana Schader, Alexander Cecil, Julia Schönfeld, Martin Halle, Arne Pfeufer, Jerzy Adamski, Johannes Scherr

**Objectives:**
We aimed to identify characteristic metabolic patterns in 76 male athletes at different performance levels during their preparation for and participation in a marathon race.

**Methods:**
A targeted metabolomics approach was used to analyze blood plasma samples from 76 male subjects who participated in the Munich marathon in 2013 (Enzy-MaGIC-Study). Metabolic changes were analyzed at two time points before and three time points after the marathon. The cohort was stratified into top, average, and low performers based on general endurance (relative VO2max) and net running time during the marathon.

**Results:**
Overall, we observed increased concentrations of acylcarnitines (AC) and reduced concentrations of amino acids (AA) and phospholipids (PL) immediately after the race compared to pre-exercise levels. In the following 24 and 72 hours, there was a significant supercompensation of AA and PL levels. The metabolite profiles also revealed performer class-related characteristics, with the most pronounced differences observed for acylcarnitines and urea cycle-related amino acids immediately after the race.

**Conclusion:**
Our study demonstrates characteristic metabolite patterns between pre- and post-marathon time points and reveals performance-dependent differences in the marathon-induced changes in the metabolome.

### P-112: Differentiation of Fasting and Non-fasting Plasma Samples by Informative Metabolite Sets

**Presenting Author:** Patrick Dreher, Helmholtz Center Munich, Germany

**Co-Authors:** Johannes Raffler, Thomas Skurk, Hans Hauner, Robert Mohney, Hannelore Daniel, Karsten Suhre, Gabi Kastenmüller

**Background:**
Blood metabolites are easily accessible biomarkers that can extend routine clinical chemistry. Using non-fasted blood samples simplifies blood sampling for patients and clinicians. However, the metabolite readout reflects the current metabolic status, which can differ significantly between fasted and fed states, necessitating the consideration of fasting status for accurate clinical interpretation. Dietary intake can also increase subject variability.

**Methods:**
We developed two machine learning prediction models to differentiate plasma samples into non-fasting (less than 4h or 6h postprandial) and fasting states. These models were trained using an iterative random forest approach with backward variable selection on the time-resolved HuMet dataset, which includes 56 time points with four different meal and fasting periods in 15 healthy men. A total of 595 metabolites were identified using non-targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics.

**Results:**
The 4h prediction model contains nine metabolites that display two distinct kinetic patterns: one group, including glucose, fructose, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate, shows elevated levels during non-fasting and low levels during fasting. Six fatty acids (mostly medium-chain) exhibit a mirror-inverted behavior. The 6h prediction model includes these six fatty acids, nucleotides, and bile acids, which show comparatively slower postprandial changes in blood levels. Our models classify plasma samples with a low error rate (<8.4%).

**Conclusion:**
These prediction models will be validated in large cohort studies, providing a valuable tool for differentiating fasting and non-fasting plasma samples.

### P-113: NMR-Based Metabolic Analysis of Human Blood Associated with Particulate Matter in Air Pollution

**Presenting Author:** Seoyoung Jang, Korea Basic Science Institute, South Korea

**Co-Authors:** Juhwan Noh, Changsoo Kim, Geum-Sook Hwang

**Background:**
Particulate matter (PM) is a major environmental risk factor associated with respiratory and nervous system disorders. We evaluated the changes in human blood metabolites in response to PM exposure and investigated the association between these changes and PM10 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5-10 µm).

**Methods:**
We analyzed whole blood samples from 457 Koreans using 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Multivariate linear regression was performed, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and smoking status.

**Results:**
We found that PM10 significantly altered energy metabolism, including succinate, pyruvate, lactate, and fumarate. This study demonstrates that NMR-based metabolic profiling can be a useful tool for assessing the impact of environmental pollutants on human metabolism and identifying potential biomarkers for predicting air pollution exposure.

### P-114: Metabolite Profiling of Multiple Measures of Adiposity: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis

**Presenting Author:** Matthew Lee, MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, United Kingdom

**Co-Authors:** Kaitlin Wade, Laura Corbin, Nicholas Timpson

**Background:**
The mechanisms by which obesity affects disease are poorly understood. Studying different adiposity measures together with intermediate phenotypes reflective of physiological function can provide valuable insights into etiological disease pathways.

**Methods:**
We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal effect of several adiposity measures on metabolic intermediates. Genetic variants for body mass index (BMI), waist-hip-ratio (WHR), and body fat percentage (BF%) were used as proxy measures for exposures. The outcomes included 123 metabolites derived from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. An inverse variance weighted multiplicative random effects model was applied, and a newly developed web tool, MR-Vis, was used to visualize and explore causal perturbations of metabolic profiles.

**Results:**
Across all three exposures, the direction of effect was consistent for 106 metabolites. BMI and WHR exhibited similar effects across a range of metabolites, including an inverse association with medium to large HDL and a positive association with a range of LDL and VLDL particles. Many results for BF% were consistent with the null. A positive association with glycoprotein acetyls and phenylalanine (P<0.05/123) was observed across all three exposures.

**Conclusion:**
The consistency observed in the relationship between different measures of adiposity and metabolic intermediates suggests some redundancy in these measures. However, contrasting associations can provide insight into the biological mechanisms underpinning these differences.

### P-115: Joint Analysis of Metabolite Markers of Fish Intake and Persistent Organic Pollutants in Relation to Type 2 Diabetes Risk in Swedish Adults

**Presenting Author:** Rikard Landberg, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden

**Co-Authors:** Lin Shi, Carl Brunius, Ingvar A. Bergdahl, Ingegerd Johansson, Olov Rolandsson, Carolina Donat Vargas, Hannu Kiviranta, Kati Hanhineva, Agneta Åkesson

**Background:**
Conflicting evidence exists regarding the association between fish intake and type 2 diabetes (T2D) incidence, potentially due to self-reported dietary intake assessments and co-exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) present in fish.

**Methods:**
We identified plasma metabolites associated with fish intake and assessed their association with T2D risk, independently from co-exposure to POPs, in a case-control study nested within the Swedish prospective Västerbotten Intervention Programme cohort. Plasma samples from 421 case-control pairs at baseline and 10-year follow-up samples from a subset of 149 pairs were analyzed using untargeted LC-MS metabolomics. Additionally, 16 plasma POPs were analyzed for the sub-population (149 pairs).

**Results:**
We identified 31 metabolites associated with fish intake using multivariate modeling and partial correlation analysis. No association was observed between fish intake, either reflected by metabolites or measured by food frequency questionnaires, and T2D risk, using a conventional multivariate logistic regression adjusted for POPs. Interestingly, integrating fish-related metabolites and plasma POPs using two-way orthogonal partial least squares regression led to a unique metabolite component independent of POPs, which was borderline inversely associated with T2D risk (odds ratio: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.02, P=0.07). This component mainly reflected fatty fish intake and consisted of several species of phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines.

**Conclusion:**
Our results support that fatty fish may be beneficial for T2D prevention, although simultaneous co-exposure to POPs may counteract these effects in Swedish adults. Integrating metabolite markers and POP exposures appears to be a promising approach to advance the understanding of associations between fish intake and T2D incidence in populations co-exposed to POPs.

### P-116: Plasma Biomarkers of Boiled and Filtered Coffee Intake and Their Association with Type 2 Diabetes Risk

**Presenting Author:** Carl Brunius, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden

**Co-Authors:** Lin Shi, Ingegerd Johansson, Ingvar A. Bergdahl, Olov Rolandsson, Kati Hanhineva, Rikard Landberg

**Background:**
Habitual coffee intake has been associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), but few studies have investigated different coffee brews, such as boiled and filtered, separately.

**Methods:**
We identified metabolites related to either filtered or boiled coffee and assessed their association with T2D risk in a nested case-control study within the Swedish prospective cohort Västerbotten Intervention Programme. Plasma samples from 421 case-control pairs at baseline and from a subset of 149 pairs at 10-year follow-up were analyzed using untargeted LC-MS metabolomics.

**Results:**
We identified 31 metabolites associated with boiled- (0.1≤ |r| ≤ 0.47) and 30 associated with filtered coffee intake (0.1≤ |r| ≤ 0.34), respectively, using multivariate modeling and partial correlation analysis adjusted for lifestyle confounders. Among these metabolites, 14 and 10 were unbiasedly selected in panels by LASSO regression for accurate and specific prediction of boiled (AROC = 0.91) and filtered coffee (AROC = 0.90), respectively. Moreover, metabolite panels could also predict boiled and filtered coffee intake after 10 years of follow-up (AROC = 0.71 and 0.80, respectively).

**Conclusion:**
We observed an inverse association between the metabolite panel score related to filtered coffee and T2D risk, independent of established risk factors and lifestyle confounders. No association was observed for boiled coffee. For the first time, we identified metabolite panels that can be used as selective biomarkers for boiled and filtered coffee intake, respectively. Our study supports a protective role of habitual intake of filtered coffee on T2D development.

### P-117: Investigating In Vivo Digestion of Sheep and Cow Milk in a Rat Model

**Presenting Author:** Linda Samuelsson, AgResearch Ltd, New Zealand

**Co-Authors:** Natalie Ahlborn, Wayne Young

**Background:**
Sheep milk is a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and energy, with up to 50% more milk solids than cow milk. Anecdotally, sheep milk is thought to be better tolerated than cow milk, possibly due to differences in milk protein digestibility. However, controlled scientific studies examining this potential difference are lacking.

**Methods:**
We compared the digestion of sheep and cow milk in terms of a) apparent ileal amino acid digestibility and b) metabolite profiles in serum and cecal contents in a rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a dairy-free rodent chow and provided with sheep or cow milk over a 28-day period. Serum, distal ileal content, and cecal content were collected.

**Results:**
At day 28, amino acid digestibility in the distal ileum was higher in rats fed sheep milk. Amino acid intake in sheep milk-fed rats was 1.8 times higher, but the amino acid concentration in the ileal content was only 1.3 times higher. Concentrations of essential amino acids in serum were significantly higher in rats fed sheep milk, indicating that sheep milk proteins are more readily digested. Additionally, rats fed sheep milk had higher concentrations of dimethyl sulfone, γ-aminobutyric acid, amino acids, and short-chain fatty acids in serum and cecal contents compared to rats fed cow milk, indicating different digestion products.

**Conclusion:**
The potential for these products to have differential effects on physiology and health is yet to be established.

### P-118: Lifestyle-Intervention-Induced Reduction of Abdominal Fat Is Reflected by Increased Serum HDL Diameter and Decreased Glycerol Level

**Presenting Author:** Marian Beekman, Leiden University Medical Center, Netherlands

**Co-Authors:** Bianca A.M. Schutte, Erik B. van den Akker, Raymond Noordam, Petra Dibbets-Schneider, Lioe-Fee de Geus-Oei, Joris Deelen, Ondine van de Rest, Diana van Heemst, Edith J.M. Feskens, P. Eline Slagboom

**Background:**
Abdominal obesity is a major modifiable risk factor for age-related cardiometabolic disease. Cardiometabolic disease risk and its associated abdominal fat mass, cholesterol, and glucose levels can be reduced by a healthier lifestyle. Our aim is to understand the relationship between lifestyle intervention-induced changes in body composition, specifically abdominal fat, and the accompanying molecular changes.

**Methods:**
We used data from the Growing Old Together (GOTO) study, where 164 older adults (mean age 63 years, BMI 23-35 kg/m²) changed their lifestyle during 13 weeks by 12.5% caloric restriction plus 12.5% increase in energy expenditure.

**Results:**
We show that the levels of circulating metabolic biomarkers specifically reflect the abdominal fat mass, even after adjustment for body mass index. The applied lifestyle intervention resulted in a reduction of abdominal fat (-2.6%, SD=3.0), and this reduction, when adjusted for weight loss, was highly associated with an increase in HDL diameter and a decrease in circulating glycerol levels.

**Conclusion:**
Circulating glycerol levels and HDL diameter may be valuable tools for monitoring the weight-loss-independent beneficial effects of lifestyle change.

### P-119: Metabolic Features of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)

**Presenting Author:** Emi Yamano, Health Metrics Development Team, RIKEN Compass to Healthy Life Research, Japan

**Co-Authors:** Masahiro Sugimoto, Satoshi Kume, Yasuyoshi Watanabe, Tomoyoshi Soga, Lucinda Bateman, Suzanne D. Vernon, Yosky Kataoka

**Background:**
The pathogenesis of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), characterized by exertional and severely debilitating fatigue lasting at least 6 consecutive months, is not fully understood. Due to incomplete understanding of the etiology and diagnostic uncertainty, there are no firmly established objective diagnoses using biomarkers.

**Methods:**
We performed comprehensive metabolomic analyses of plasma samples obtained from ME/CFS patients and healthy controls in the United States using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). We focused on alterations in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and urea cycles, referencing our previous findings of inactivity in these metabolic cycles in ME/CFS.

**Results:**
In ME/CFS patients, malate was increased, and arginine was decreased relative to healthy controls. Female patients with ME/CFS notably exhibited abnormalities in TCA and urea cycles compared with male patients. The arginine/malate ratio discriminated female patients with ME/CFS from female healthy controls, yielding an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.61-0.72, P < 0.0001).

**Conclusion:**
This suggests that ME/CFS patients in the US may have dysregulation of TCA and urea cycles, reflecting the pathophysiological state in line with our finding in Japanese samples. Sex may be a significant factor in the development of the biomarker for ME/CFS. These findings will help establish objective diagnosis markers and treatment recommendations for ME/CFS.

### P-120: Machine Learning of Human Plasma Lipidomes for Obesity Estimation in a Large Population Cohort

**Presenting Author:** Christian Klose, Lipotype GmbH, Germany

**Co-Authors:** Mathias J. Gerl, Michal A. Surma, Celine Fernandez, Olle Melander, Satu Männistö, Katja Borodulin, Aki S. Havulinna, Veikko Salomaa, Elina Ikonen, Carlo V. Cannistraci, Kai Simons

**Background:**
Shotgun lipidomics of human plasma provides hundreds of individual lipid measurements in a fast, reproducible, single assay, making it a useful quantitative method for biomarker identification.

**Methods:**
We trained machine intelligence models to predict obesity estimates, i.e., body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and body fat percentage (BFP), on a lipidomic dataset of 1061 samples from the FINRISK 2012 cohort and confirmed the outcome by an independent validation dataset from the Malmö Diet and Cancer Cardiovascular Cohort.

**Results:**
Comparison of the different models revealed that the lipidome predicted BFP the best. The plasma lipidome also contains information about body fat distribution, as WHR was predicted more accurately than BMI. These modeling results required full resolution of the lipidome to the lipid species level. The addition of routine clinical laboratory variables, such as HDL- or LDL-cholesterol, did not improve the model further. Correlation analyses of individual lipid species, controlled for age and separated by sex, demonstrated the multi-parametric nature of the correlation with BFP. Correlation profiles were similar between the three obesity estimates but very different from those lipids correlating with HDL-, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.

**Conclusion:**
The power of the lipidomics association was demonstrated, and the lipidome provides a robust and accurate predictor of obesity measures.

### P-121: Metabolite Trajectories Following Contrasting Prudent and Western Diets from Food Provisions: Identifying Biomarkers of Short-term Changes in Habitual Diet

**Presenting Author:** Philip Britz-McKibbin, McMaster University, Canada

**Co-Authors:** Nadine Wellington, Meera Shanmuganathan, Russell J. de Souza, Sandi Azab, Mateen Sheikh, Michael Zulyniak, Jonathon Bloomfield, Alicia Mell, Ritchie Ly, Dipika Desai, Sonia S. Anand

**Background:**
Recent changes to habitual diet play important roles in population health, including alarming rises in obesity prevalence and chronic disease risk worldwide. Few objective biomarkers of recent food intake are used in nutritional epidemiology, which relies on food frequency questionnaires or dietary records prone to bias and selective reporting.

**Methods:**
Metabolomic analyses were performed on healthy participants (n=42) from the Diet and Genetic Intervention (DIGEST) study based on a parallel two-arm randomized clinical trial. Matching urine and plasma specimens were collected at baseline and following a 2-week assigned Prudent or Western diet, where participants were provided all food items with a weight-maintaining menu plan from a dietician. Targeted and non-targeted metabolite profiling was conducted using three complementary instrumental platforms with stringent quality control to avoid false discoveries.

**Results:**
Metabolic phenotype changes were characterized based on distinctive trajectories following 2 weeks of food provisions compared to baseline habitual diet of participants using univariate and multivariate statistical models. Unknown metabolites associated with contrasting dietary patterns were identified with high-resolution MS/MS and co-elution after spiking with authentic standards. Top-ranked metabolite trajectories were also correlated to self-reported changes in average intake of macro/micronutrients from diet records.

**Conclusion:**
For the first time, we have identified robust biomarkers sensitive to short-term changes in dietary patterns from food provisions that are applicable to a healthy and free-living population outside of a laboratory setting.

### P-122: A Step-Wise Nutrimetabolomics Approach Reveals Food-Specific Compounds in Urine of Adults Consuming a DASH-Style Diet

**Presenting Author:** Nichole Reisdorph, University of Colorado, United States

**Co-Authors:** Audrey E. Hendricks, Minghua Tang, Katrina A. Doenges, Richard M. Reisdorph, Brian C. Tooker, Kevin Quinn, Sarah J. Borengasser, Yasmeen Nkrumah-Elie, Daniel N. Frank, Wayne W. Campbell, Nancy F. Krebs

**Background:**
Although the health benefits of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet are established, it is not understood which specific compounds in foods are responsible for these benefits.

**Methods:**
We utilized a step-wise approach to identify unique compounds from individual foods of a DASH-style diet, determined if these food-specific compounds (FSCs) are detectable in urine, and then examined relationships between these urinary-FSCs and blood pressure (BP). Nineteen subjects were randomized into 6-week controlled DASH-style diet interventions. Untargeted, LC/MS-based metabolomics was performed on 24-hour urine samples collected before and after each intervention and on 12 representative DASH-style foods. Linear mixed effects models were used to correlate FSCs to BP changes. Mass spectrometry signals for FSCs were summed to derive a food-specific signature to evaluate nutrikinetics.

**Results:**
Between 66-969 compounds were determined to be FSCs, and between 13-190 of these FSCs were detected in urine. Nutrikinetics demonstrated a relationship between food consumption and the presence of food-specific signatures in urine. Although no urinary FSCs were associated with BP, 16 and 6 non-FSC, urinary compounds were associated with BP and changes in BP over time, respectively. These comprised both endogenous and exogenous compounds, including some food-related compounds not analyzed by LC/MS/MS in this study.

**Conclusion:**
This study establishes a technical, analytical, and conceptual framework upon which future nutrimetabolomics studies can be built. A novel aspect of this study is the use of food-specific signatures to evaluate nutrikinetics.

### P-123: Syringol Metabolites as Biomarkers of Smoked Meat Intake

**Presenting Author:** Roland Wedekind, International Agency for Research on Cancer, France

**Co-Authors:** Pekka Keski-Rahkonen, Nivonirina Robinot, Vivian Viallon, Pietro Ferrari, Erwan Engel, Marc J. Gunter, Inge Huybrechts, Augustin Scalbert

**Background:**
Processed meat is associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer, but the estimation of intake of this heterogeneous food group in epidemiological studies is challenging due to the lack of sufficient details in dietary questionnaires.

**Objective:**
To identify novel biomarkers of intake of processed meat products using metabolomics.

**Design:**
An untargeted metabolomic approach based on LC-MS was applied to processed meat products previously digested in vitro and to urine and plasma samples from a randomized cross-over dietary intervention where 12 volunteers consumed successively 3 processed meat products and two other control foods over 3 days. The identified biomarkers were then measured in urine from 474 subjects from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) cross-sectional study, for which a 24-hour dietary recall and food frequency questionnaires were available.

**Results:**
Syringol and four derivatives of syringol were found to be characteristic of digests of smoked meat products. The same compounds, present as sulfate esters in urine, showed increased levels following the consumption of smoked meat products in the intervention study. They were also positively associated with recent and habitual consumption of smoked meat products in urine samples from participants of the EPIC cross-sectional study. These markers showed good discriminative ability for smoked meat intake with receiver operator characteristic areas under the curve up to 0.86 and 0.79 for short-term and habitual intake, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
The biomarkers of smoked meat intake identified in this study may be used to improve the assessment of smoked meat intake in epidemiological studies.

### P-124: Association of the Metabolome with Health Parameters and Food Intake in a Prostate Cancer Cohort: An Untargeted Metabolomics Study

**Presenting Author:** Johnny R. Östman, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Sweden

**Co-Authors:** Rui C. Pinto, Elin Thysell, Timothy M.D. Ebbels, Göran Hallmans, Ali A. Moazzami

**Background:**
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in men. The associations between PCa risk and pre-diagnostic metabolite levels have been previously investigated but have yielded inconclusive results.

**Methods:**
We used a liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry untargeted metabolomics approach to look for metabolites associated with the risk of future PCa in fasting plasma using a nested case-control study design of 777 pairs of PCa cases and their matched controls (n = 1554) recruited from the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study Cohort (NSHDS). To avoid variation, we only included cases with a follow-up of over 5 years. Within this cohort, an additional sub-cohort of cases with aggressive PCa was identified (n = 169 pairs). A range of health parameters (e.g., body mass index, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, food frequency questionnaire answers) was collected for all subjects at baseline. The untargeted metabolomics approach identified approximately 3000 features, which were further condensed into approximately 1200 features using a novel batch matching algorithm.

**Results:**
The associations of the metabolomic features with the health parameters were investigated using conditional logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. Several metabolites were found to be associated with PCa risk, and these associations were further explored in the sub-cohort of aggressive PCa cases.

**Conclusion:**
Our study provides new insights into the metabolic profile associated with PCa risk and highlights the potential of untargeted metabolomics in identifying biomarkers for early detection and risk stratification of PCa.
