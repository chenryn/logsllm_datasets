### Figure 12: J-Function Results for All Six Images

Figure 12 illustrates the results of the J-function for all six images. It is important to note that the data points are discrete, and the lines connecting them have been added solely for readability. The J-function approaching 0 indicates clustering (J=0 signifies that all data points are within a single cluster of radius r). A J-value approaching 1 suggests random distribution, while a J-value greater than 1 indicates uniform distribution (evenly spaced points). Ideally, we aim for a click-point distribution as close to J=1 as possible.

From Figure 12, it is evident that PassPoints suffers from clustering of click-points, a known issue with the original PassPoints scheme [7,13,20,33]. However, a key finding is that participants in the current study were no more likely to select clustered click-points than those who had only one password to remember. The results for the two datasets are very similar.

### 5. Validation of Hypotheses

We now revisit our hypotheses on multiple password interference based on the study results.

1. **Hypothesis 1: Recall Success Rates**
   - **Prediction:** Participants will have lower recall success rates with text passwords than with PassPoints passwords.
   - **Result:** Partially supported. Users in the PassPoints condition had significantly higher recall success rates in the short term. However, after two weeks, both groups had similarly low success rates.

2. **Hypothesis 2: Use of Patterns Across Passwords**
   - **Prediction:** Participants in the Text condition are more likely to use patterns across their passwords.
   - **Result:** Partially supported. 53% of participants in the Text condition created passwords following a common pattern across their accounts, compared to only two PassPoints participants. Although Text passwords showed more evidence of patterns, a direct comparison was not feasible due to different measures for the two types of passwords.

3. **Hypothesis 3: Recall Speed**
   - **Prediction:** Participants will recall text passwords more slowly than PassPoints passwords.
   - **Result:** Partially supported. Overall, participants in the Text condition were slower to recall their passwords in the short term. This result may be surprising to many. One factor influencing this is that Text participants made more errors, leading to more time spent re-entering their passwords. When considering only successful first attempts, there was no significant difference in password entry times between the Text and PassPoints conditions. After two weeks, successful Text participants entered their passwords more quickly than PassPoints participants.

4. **Hypothesis 4: Account-Related Passwords**
   - **Prediction:** Participants in the Text condition are more likely to create passwords directly related to their corresponding accounts.
   - **Result:** Supported. 68% of participants in the Text condition used the account name or type as a mnemonic to create a password related to its account. No such evidence was found for PassPoints participants. It is unclear how one would create account-related passwords in click-based graphical password schemes.

5. **Hypothesis 5: Recall Errors**
   - **Prediction:** Participants in the Text condition will make more recall errors than PassPoints participants.
   - **Result:** Supported. Users in the Text condition made significantly more recall errors during both Recall-1 and Recall-2. They were more likely to make repeated attempts at entering their password, which is potentially dangerous as it may reveal other passwords in the presence of key loggers or on phishing sites. PassPoints participants preferred to indicate they had forgotten their password rather than engaging in this insecure behavior.

### 6. Discussion and Limitations

Cued-recall is cognitively simpler than uncued recall, and many users attempt to turn remembering their password into a cued-recall task. This strategy often weakens text passwords because they are likely based on obvious and common cues, such as account or website names.

In the short term, PassPoints passwords are easier to recall than text passwords when participants have several passwords to remember. We suspect that having a cue helped PassPoints participants remember which password was associated with each account. Participants in the Text condition created mnemonics to associate an account with its password, such as including the word "email" in the password for their email account. This strategy helped with short-term recall but was ineffective after two weeks.

Prior to the study, none of the PassPoints participants had experience with graphical passwords, while all Text participants had extensive experience with text passwords. This gave Text participants an advantage in recalling passwords after two weeks. However, the image as a recall cue provided an advantage to PassPoints participants. Note that the Text participants' use of mnemonics inherently leads to insecure passwords, whereas PassPoints' image cue does not. Adding a similar cueing mechanism to text password systems could improve security without sacrificing memorability.

The role of distinct images as cues is crucial; otherwise, confusion and interference can become problematic. Our strong intuition is that users should not be asked to remember different passwords on the same image, as this would likely lead to interference problems. Using the same images across systems decreases security due to password reuse. Click-based graphical passwords offer a compromise by using system-assigned images and allowing user choice of click-points within the image.

Using account-related mnemonics is problematic for security, as it makes it easier to guess account-related passwords. It can also be problematic for usability when participants need to change their passwords, as they may still associate the old mnemonic with the new password.

Our study aimed to examine the effects of password interference on user behavior and performance. We followed established psychological methods to clear working memory and adopted a cognitively challenging design to avoid ceiling effects. However, this lab study does not mirror real-life usage. Users are unlikely to create six new passwords in quick succession or recall them all after two weeks without using any of them. Despite these limitations, examining multiple password interference in a controlled setting is an important step in understanding the effects of increased memory load and user coping behaviors.

Many passwords created in both conditions were weak. For example, Text participants used account-based passwords and similar passwords across accounts, while PassPoints participants created passwords with patterns and formed hotspots. While PassPoints passwords are often weak, this does not diminish the study's results. Future work includes testing alternative click-based graphical password systems and conducting field studies to further examine multiple password interference in a more ecologically valid setting.

### 7. Conclusion

Our lab study results indicate that in the short term, PassPoints passwords are more robust against multiple password interference (assuming distinct background images). In the short term, participants could more easily remember multiple click-based graphical passwords than multiple text passwords. Participants in the Text condition made significantly more recall errors and resorted to additional coping strategies, such as using account-based passwords or cycling through all their passwords. The memory cueing provided by click-based graphical passwords is a key factor in better user performance, and cueing should be part of any recall-based authentication scheme where possible.

After two weeks, recall of the passwords in the text and graphical conditions was not statistically different. Given that users were more familiar with text passwords, they were better positioned to remember these passwords. However, this advantage was offset by the built-in memory cue of graphical passwords, which is a more secure memory aid than typical text password coping mechanisms. Our results raise an interesting research question: Can cueing mechanisms be safely added to text passwords to achieve the same memorability advantages seen in click-based graphical passwords?
