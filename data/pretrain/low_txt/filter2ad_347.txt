## Abstract
The Cloud Computing Security Workshop (CCSW) focuses on the security challenges and opportunities presented by cloud computing. The term "cloud" generally refers to an aggregation of computing resources within a highly elastic and virtualized environment, often shared among multiple tenants. As a multifaceted trend, cloud computing intersects with a broad range of disciplines, creating diverse security and privacy requirements. The workshop aims to highlight the security and privacy issues raised by cloud computing and to foster a deeper understanding of the connection between research and practice in this dynamic and transformative field.

## 1. Introduction
The term "cloud" has many definitions and synonyms, including utility computing, grid computing, and Platform as a Service (PaaS). These terms all point to the same trend: the consolidation of computing, storage, and networking resources within a single, typically shared infrastructure. With multiple stakeholders and users operating side-by-side in a cloud environment, the security and privacy challenges are significant. However, cloud computing also presents opportunities to enhance security through the judicious use of virtualization, consolidation of security administration, and the rethinking of security engineering in a centralized platform.

Since its inception in 2009, CCSW has become the premier venue for research on security and privacy in cloud computing. It has produced some of the most popular and highly cited papers in the CCS family of workshops and has attracted a diverse range of invited speakers. The workshop brings together researchers and practitioners to address all aspects of security in cloud-centric and outsourced computing. Like its parent conference, CCS, CCSW offers a program that spans a broad range of topics and disciplines, including network security, consumer privacy, virtualization security, secure hardware, and cryptography, among others.

## 2. Topics of Interest
The broad scope of CCSW is reflected in the following topics of interest:
- Practical cryptographic protocols for cloud security
- Secure cloud resource virtualization mechanisms
- Secure data management outsourcing (e.g., database as a service)
- Practical privacy and integrity mechanisms for outsourcing
- Foundations of cloud-centric threat models
- Secure computation outsourcing
- Remote attestation mechanisms in clouds
- Sandboxing and VM-based enforcements
- Trust and policy management in clouds
- Secure identity management mechanisms
- New cloud-aware web service security paradigms and mechanisms
- Cloud-centric regulatory compliance issues and mechanisms
- Business and security risk models and clouds
- Cost and usability models and their interaction with security in clouds
- Scalability of security in global-size clouds
- Trusted computing technology and clouds
- Binary analysis of software for remote attestation and cloud protection
- Network security (DOS, IDS, etc.) mechanisms for cloud contexts
- Security for emerging cloud programming models
- Energy/cost/efficiency of security in clouds

## 3. Invited Speakers
We are delighted to have three distinguished speakers representing both industry and research perspectives on cloud security:
- **Daniele Catteddu**
  - Managing Director EMEA, Cloud Security Alliance
- **Marnix Dekker**
  - Security Expert and Information Security Officer, European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA)
