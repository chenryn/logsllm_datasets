#### 1.1 Introduction
The Executing Process Phase is a critical stage in Organizational Change Management (OCM) as it involves the implementation of business and technology changes. During this phase, OCM activities are in full motion, and the OCM Practitioner and team work closely with the Project Manager and other team members to execute these activities.

#### 1.2 Recommended Practices
- **Garner Management and Supervisor Support Throughout Implementation:**
  Managers, supervisors, and team leads play a crucial role in influencing their direct employees to adopt the changes. They help communicate awareness and mitigate resistance. It is important to tailor activities to meet the unique needs of these leaders.

- **Provide Opportunities for People to Feel Heard:**
  The OCM Practitioner should facilitate face-to-face and two-way dialogues to allow impacted stakeholders to ask questions and express concerns. This builds trust and reduces resistance.

- **Be Repetitive and Consistent with Communications:**
  Communication messages must be repeated and delivered through multiple channels to ensure they are accurately understood. Consistency is key, especially as stakeholders frequently communicate with each other.

- **Recognize the Need for Celebrating Project Team Successes:**
  Implementations can be challenging, and celebrating successes along the way helps energize the team. Quick wins and recognition of achievements can build momentum and further the vision for change.

- **Understand that Resistance is a Natural Part of the Change Process:**
  The OCM Practitioner must accept that resistance is natural and plan activities to minimize and address it. Identifying and removing barriers to change is a shared responsibility between the Sponsor and the OCM team.

- **Set Specific Training Goals:**
  Training goals should be realistic and focused on the learners' needs, the organization's culture, and the nature of the change. Avoid setting unattainable or overly complex learning objectives.

### 2.1 OCM Lifecycle Management
OCM Lifecycle Management involves updating the OCM Schedule and conducting another assessment of organizational change readiness. These updates are used to revise the OCM Plan developed during the Planning Process Phase, accounting for any changes in the organization and project. This ensures a strong foundation as the change initiative affects larger groups of leaders, employees, and stakeholders.

### 2.2 Communication
Communication activities expand to include larger audiences and more detailed content. The OCM Practitioner uses the Communication Management Plan to strategize, develop, and deliver the right content, from the right sender, at the right time, to the right audience, via the right delivery channel.

### 2.3 Leadership Support
Leadership Support activities continue to identify, assess, and support leaders in impacted areas. As the project moves closer to implementation, the OCM Practitioner focuses on supervisors, managers, and executives to ensure all levels of leadership are visibly supportive of the change. This includes assessing leaders, defining necessary actions, and executing those activities.

### 2.4 Team Dynamics
During the Executing Process Phase, the project team expands and develops. The OCM Practitioner performs activities to support team development and team building, ensuring the team operates in a positive, collaborative environment.

### 2.5 Stakeholder Enrollment
The OCM Practitioner builds on the Stakeholder Management activities prescribed in the CA-PMF to support stakeholder enrollment. This includes defining participation needs, identifying and engaging resources to serve as Stakeholder Group Representatives and Super Users, and coaching supervisors and managers on resistance management.

### 2.6 Training
Training is one of the final steps in implementing the change. The OCM Practitioner works with training resources to develop and deliver end-user training, including creating a Training Plan, developing curriculum and materials, and delivering the training. This provides end users with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to work in the new environment.
