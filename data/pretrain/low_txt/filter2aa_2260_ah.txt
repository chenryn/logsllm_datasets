### San Francisco Urban Area (UA) Overview

The San Francisco UA encompasses the City and County of San Francisco, along with mutual aid partners Marin and San Mateo counties.

#### Governance: Intermediate Implementation
- **Current Status:** The San Francisco Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) has an ad-hoc Communications Advisory Subcommittee, established in 2006, which includes local, state, and federal agencies such as public health, state police, and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG).
- **Challenges:** Documentation does not clearly designate the decision-making group for regional interoperable communications (e.g., Communications Advisory Committee, Technical Working Group, Communications Working Group). There are a mix of formal and informal partnerships among agencies.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Clarify the roles, responsibilities, and relationships of governance groups (e.g., San Francisco UASI, Bay Area Super UASI Group, Communications Advisory Committee, Communications Working Group, Technical Working Group) identified in the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP).
  - Establish a formal charter for the Communications Working Group, including all relevant agencies, and document their roles and responsibilities.
  - Develop, document, and formalize agreements (e.g., signed memoranda of understanding [MOUs] with defined roles and responsibilities) among all participating agencies.
  - Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., MOUs, intergovernmental agreements) in the TICP, store them in an accessible format, and establish a regular review process.
  - Continue to develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, taking into account a long-term (3 to 5 years) funding strategy.
  - Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met.
  - Broaden and champion a governance structure that supports regional communications interoperability, involving senior regional government leadership in long-term funding plans.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Intermediate Implementation
- **Current Status:** The San Francisco UA TICP represents the first formal interoperable communications regional SOPs, incorporating various law enforcement SOPs and other informal procedures. Participation in the development of the TICP was initially limited, and there is a need for better dissemination to area agencies.
- **Challenges:** During the TICP validation exercise, participants faced procedural difficulties, highlighting the need for increased training on interoperability procedures. The UA began implementing NIMS/ICS less than a year ago and is still in the early stages of implementation.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Develop regional communications interoperability SOPs with participation from first responder agencies across all applicable jurisdictions and disciplines.
  - Distribute and implement SOPs through regular training, exercises, and usage.
  - Dispatchers should conduct drills on enabling, establishing, and disabling all methods for achieving interoperable communications.
  - Schedule a regular review and update process for developed policies and procedures.
  - Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.
  - Evaluate NIMS/ICS compliance during all future exercises.

#### Usage: Established Implementation
- **Current Status:** The San Francisco UA frequently uses its available means of interoperable communications (e.g., shared channels, gateways, and shared systems). Participants demonstrated familiarity with the equipment during the TICP validation exercise but faced some difficulties activating console patches.
- **Challenges:** The TICP validation exercise was limited to local, regional, and minimal state participants, making it difficult to assess the degree to which local agencies can use interoperable communications equipment with state and federal agencies.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Regularly test and exercise deployment of and procedures for regional interoperability resources (e.g., activation of console patches) to improve proficiency.
  - Include additional state and federal agencies (e.g., FBI, USCG) in future exercises and day-to-day use.
  - Add interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day activities.

### Technology Overview
- **Current Technology:** The UA uses an 800 MHz trunked system that supports a majority of users, with several shared channels, especially in the very high frequency band. The UA has a limited number of radio caches and gateways and is working with other UASI sites in the Bay Area to upgrade and integrate their respective microwave backbones for improved interoperability.

### San Jose Urban Area (UA) Overview

The San Jose UA includes the cities and unincorporated areas of Campbell, Cupertino, Gilroy, Los Altos, Milpitas, Monte Sereno, Morgan Hill, Mountain View, Palo Alto, San Jose, Santa Clara, and Saratoga.

#### Governance: Advanced Implementation
- **Current Status:** The San Jose UASI Advisory Working Group works with the Silicon Valley Regional Interoperability Project (SVRIP), which developed the TICP. SVRIP includes local, state, and federal agencies and actively recruits new members. The area has formal agreements and partnerships among all public safety organizations.
- **Challenges:** The Executive Steering Committee annually reviews the regional strategic plan for interoperable communications and is working to create an expanded regional emergency communications plan. Local resources are used for lifecycle costs, and budgets are developed according to regional strategic goals.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Continue to align local, regional, and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met.
  - Continue to develop and implement a regional approach to long-term (3 to 5 years) sustainable funding consistent with the strategic plan.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Advanced Implementation
- **Current Status:** The San Jose UA incorporated existing policies and procedures into the TICP and disseminated them to all participating organizations. The area began implementing NIMS/ICS more than a year ago and includes fire, law enforcement, emergency medical services, and public works organizations in the training.
- **Challenges:** During the TICP validation exercise, participants demonstrated familiarity with NIMS/ICS but experienced minimal difficulties.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Ensure that TICP peer review recommendations are incorporated into the TICP.
  - Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.
  - Clarify the roles of the Regional Interoperability Coordinator (RIC) and law enforcement mutual aid coordinator.

#### Usage: Established Implementation
- **Current Status:** The UA regularly uses available means of interoperable communications (e.g., radio cache, gateways, and shared channels) during day-to-day, task force, and mutual aid incidents. Participants demonstrated familiarity with the equipment during the TICP validation exercise.
- **Challenges:** Despite overall success, there were difficulties, such as a failed shared channel and the lack of a pre-published backup communications plan.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Regularly test and exercise deployment of and procedures for regional interoperability resources to improve proficiency.
  - Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day activities.

### Technology Overview
- **Current Technology:** The UA fields a variety of communications systems, including very high frequency, ultra-high frequency, T-Band, and 800 MHz bands. Interoperability is achieved through the BayMACS system, which provides an area-wide simulcast of all four frequency bands. The SVRIP has a roadmap to interoperability, including short-term, mid-term, and long-range planning efforts.
