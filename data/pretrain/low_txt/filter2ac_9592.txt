**ATT&CK ID:** T1071  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Application Layer Protocol

Adversaries may use Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) application layer protocols to communicate with compromised systems, thereby blending in with legitimate network traffic and evading detection or filtering. This technique involves embedding commands and their results within the protocol traffic exchanged between the client and server. By doing so, malicious activities can appear as normal, authorized communications, making them more difficult to identify and block.
