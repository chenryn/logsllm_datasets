To configure the DHCP service on a Windows Server to automatically assign IP addresses to clients in your local area network (LAN), follow these steps:

1. **Open Server Manager**:
   - Launch the Server Manager on your Windows Server.

2. **Add Roles and Features**:

     - Click "Next" and select the type of role or feature to be added.
     - Choose the "DHCP Server" role and click "Next".
     - Continue through the wizard, clicking "Next" until you reach the installation page.
     - Click "Install" to complete the installation of the DHCP Server role.

4. **Complete DHCP Configuration**:
   - After the installation is complete, click the "Complete DHCP Configuration" link to start the DHCP Server Configuration Wizard.

6. **Configure IP Address Range**:
   - On the second page, specify the IP address range to be assigned, along with the subnet mask.
   - Set the DNS server address and the default gateway.

7. **Set DHCP Server IP Address**:
   - On the third page, set the IP address to be used by the DHCP server.
   - If "Fully Managed Mode" is enabled, you may need to specify the bootstrap file to use when starting the client.

8. **Activate the DHCP Scope**:
   - On the final page, click the "Activate Scope" button to activate the DHCP scope.
   - This will enable your Windows Server to automatically assign IP addresses to DHCP clients in the LAN.
