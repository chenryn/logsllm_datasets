### Efficient Signal Strength on Modern Networks

Figure 11 illustrates the baseline latencies of Tor routers, as well as the latencies of routers subjected to Murdoch and Danezis's congestion attack, using the same style as in Figure 6. The results show that there are minimal differences between the latencies of routers under the congestion attack and the baseline. Figure 12 presents latency histograms for the same data, which, unlike the histograms in Figure 6, exhibit little variation between the baseline and the attack conditions.

### Conclusion

Due to the high volume of traffic on the modern Tor network, Murdoch and Danezis's analysis is unable to distinguish between normal congestion and congestion caused by an attacker. The small amount of congestion induced by their attack is lost in the overall network noise, leading to a significant number of false positives and false negatives. While these experiments represent a limited case study, and Murdoch and Danezis's analysis may still be effective in some scenarios, we did not obtain reliable results on the modern Tor network.

**Table 3:** This table shows the correlation values calculated using Murdoch and Danezis's attack on the Tor network in Spring 2008. Both false positives and false negatives are abundant; many naturally congested routers show a strong correlation, suggesting they are part of the circuit when they are not.

### Figures

**Figure 11:** These graphs correspond to Figure 10, showing the same attack in the style used in Figure 5. During the attack phase, the congestion circuit is turned on and off, as illustrated in Figure 10. For all four routers, the latency measurements are almost identical, regardless of whether the attack was present or not.

**Figure 12:** This figure again shows the same data for comparison, this time in the histogram style used in Figure 6. The overlap between the control run and the attack run is difficult to discern due to the similarity of latency distributions.

### Conclusion

The ability to construct circuits of arbitrary length was previously considered a minor issue that could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on Tor. This work demonstrates that the problem is more severe, as an adversary could use such circuits to enhance methods for determining the path packets take through the Tor network. Additionally, Tor's default choice of using circuits of length three is questionable, given that an adversary controlling an exit node would only need to recover a small amount of information to learn the entire circuit. We have made minimal changes to the Tor protocol to make it more difficult (but not impossible) for an adversary to construct long circuits.
