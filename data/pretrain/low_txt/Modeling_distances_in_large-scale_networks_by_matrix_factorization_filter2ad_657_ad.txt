### 5.3 Prediction Accuracy

The GNP dataset is somewhat atypical, as the predicted distance matrix has many more columns (869) than rows (4). Figures 6(b) and 6(c) depict the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of prediction errors for the NLANR and P2PSim datasets, which are more typical. In both cases, IDES demonstrates the best prediction accuracy. For the NLANR dataset, IDES outperforms GNP and ICS: the median relative error of IDES using SVD is only 0.03, and its 90th percentile relative error is about 0.23. The accuracy is lower for all three systems in the P2PSim dataset compared to the NLANR dataset. However, IDES (with either SVD or NMF) remains the most accurate system among the three. The better prediction results on the NLANR dataset may be due to the fact that 90% of the hosts are in North America, and the network distances, computed from the minimum round-trip time (RTT) over a day, are less affected by queuing delays and route congestion. These properties make the dataset more uniform and thus more easily modeled by a low-dimensional representation.

### 6.2 Scalability and Robustness

In the previous subsection, we demonstrated that IDES can accurately model network distances in low dimensions (d â‰¤ 10), which is crucial for scaling to large-scale networks. In this subsection, we study the impact of partially observed landmarks on the accuracy of IDES. Measuring distances to only a subset of landmark nodes reduces the overall load and allows the system to support more ordinary hosts concurrently, making it robust to partial landmark failures.

We simulated partially observed landmark scenarios in IDES using SVD to model partial distance matrices from the NLANR and P2PSim datasets. For each dataset, we experimented with two settings: 20 random landmarks and 50 random landmarks. The simulation results are shown in Figure 7. The x-axis indicates the fraction of unobserved landmarks, which were independently generated at random for each ordinary host. When the number of landmarks is less than twice the model dimensionality d, the accuracy appears sensitive to the fraction of unobserved landmarks. However, as the number of landmarks increases, the system tolerates more failures. For example, not observing 40% of the landmarks has little impact on the system's accuracy when 50 landmarks are used in the test.

### 7. Summary

In this paper, we presented a model based on matrix factorization for predicting network distances between arbitrary Internet hosts. Our model imposes fewer constraints on network distances than models based on low-dimensional embeddings; in particular, it can represent distances that violate the triangle inequality and asymmetric network distances. Such a model is more suitable for modeling the topology and complex routing policies on the Internet. Based on this model, we proposed the IDES system and two learning algorithms, SVD and NMF, for factoring matrices of network distances between arbitrary Internet hosts. Simulations on real-world datasets have shown that IDES is computationally efficient, scalable to large-scale networks, more accurate than previous models, and resilient to temporary landmark failures.
