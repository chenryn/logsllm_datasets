### Challenges
- **TV vs. Reality**: Television often portrays a simplified version of the actual engineering process.
- **Technical Understanding**: Most producers, editors, and executives were not technically inclined and focused only on the final result.
- **Complexity of Tasks**: They often underestimated the complexity of the projects.
- **Unrealistic Expectations**: Demands for unprecedented projects to be completed in two weeks or less, such as X-ray glasses or personal force fields.
- **Making Engineering Appealing**: The challenge of making the engineering process engaging for a broad audience.
