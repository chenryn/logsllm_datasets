### Service Bus Controls and Rationale

| Control Description | Rationale | Severity | Automated Fix Script | 
|---------------------|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| **Service bus clients (senders/receivers) must not use 'namespace' level access policies** | A 'namespace' level access policy grants access to all Queues/Topics within a namespace. Using an access policy at the entity (Queue/Topic) level, however, provides access only to the specific entity. This aligns with the principle of least privilege. | High | Yes | No |
| **Access policies must be defined with minimum required permissions** | Granting minimum necessary access ensures that users have just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes potential damage in case of an access policy key compromise. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Access policy keys must be protected at rest** | Encrypting sensitive data at rest reduces the risk of data loss from physical theft and helps meet regulatory compliance requirements. | High | No | No |
| **Access policy keys must be rotated periodically** | Regularly rotating keys is a best security practice as it reduces the likelihood of data loss or compromise due to key theft, brute forcing, or recovery attacks. | Medium | No | No |
| **Audit logs for Service Bus entities should be reviewed routinely** | Regular monitoring of audit logs enables early detection of suspicious or malicious activity, allowing for timely response. | Medium | No | No |
| **Sensitive data must be encrypted in transit** | Using HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking attacks. | High | No | No |
| **Expiry time of SAS token should be minimum required** | Minimizing the validity period of a SAS token reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized access in case the token is compromised. | Medium | No | No |
| **Paired Namespace should be used for disaster recovery** | A paired namespace helps maintain consistent availability of the Service Bus in case of an outage (e.g., throttling, storage issues, subsystem failure) in the primary region. | Medium | No | No |
| **All users/identities must be granted minimum required permissions using Role Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Leveraging RBAC to grant minimum necessary access ensures that users have just enough permissions to perform their tasks, minimizing exposure in case of user or service account compromise. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Diagnostics logs must be enabled with a retention period of at least 365 days** | Retaining logs for at least one year allows for the recreation of activity trails during investigations and meets typical compliance requirements. | Medium | Yes | No |

This table outlines the recommended controls for securing Service Bus, along with their rationale, severity, and whether they can be automatically fixed or require manual intervention.
