### X. Conclusions

In this paper, we introduced a novel approach for the rapid and accurate reconstruction of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns. Our method leverages two innovative techniques, tag attenuation and tag decay, to mitigate the problem of dependence explosion. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach is highly effective in the real-time, automatic detection of stealthy APT-style campaigns. These techniques significantly reduce false alarms by over an order of magnitude while generating compact scenario graphs that are, on average, 35 times smaller than traditional methods. Starting from logs containing millions of events, our approach isolates just a few dozen events that represent the attacker's activities.

### Figures

**Figure 12: Browser Extension Attack**
- **Description**: The attack began when a vulnerable browser plugin, `pass_mgr`, was compromised during a visit to a malicious website, raising `MemExec` alarms. The compromised plugin then downloaded and executed `gtcache`, which in turn downloaded and executed `ztmp`. Both programs performed reconnaissance to collect and exfiltrate sensitive information, resulting in several `DataLeak` alarms. Tracing back from these alarms, MORSE identified `pass_mgr` as the entry point. A forward analysis from this node yielded the above scenario graph.

**Figure 13: User-Level Rootkit Attack**
- **Description**: This attack utilized a user-level rootkit in the form of a shared library, `libselinux.so`, which had been installed on the victim host prior to the engagement. During the attack, the attacker used the rootkit to exfiltrate `/etc/shadow` to a remote IP address, raising a `DataLeak` alarm. This was the only indication of unusual behavior in the audit data, making it the most stealthy attack in our dataset. The attacker, possibly after using password cracking on the shadow file, obtained access to a second machine via SSH. Since the sole alarm was generated by a `bash` process, it was marked as suspicious, and a forward analysis was performed from there. The resulting graph was refined to follow only process creation and execution edges, yielding the above graph. Notable commands run by the attacker include `tcpdump`, `ifconfig`, and `ps`. Other commands included `clear console` and `chsh`. On the second machine, since a suspect process from the first machine connected to it, the target process (`sshd`) was marked as a suspect subject by MORSE. The scenario graph originating from this `sshd` process is shown together with the scenario graph generated on the first host, with the network connection indicated by a dashed line.
