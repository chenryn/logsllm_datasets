## Abstract

The payment card industry (PCI) encompasses various entities such as merchants, issuer banks, acquirer banks, and card brands. Ensuring the security of these entities is a significant challenge. The PCI Security Standards Council mandates compliance with the PCI Data Security Standard (DSS), which outlines a series of security requirements. However, there is limited knowledge about the actual enforcement of PCI DSS. In this paper, we employ a measurement approach to systematically evaluate the PCI DSS certification process for e-commerce websites. We develop an e-commerce web application testbed, BuggyCart, capable of adding or removing 35 PCI DSS-related vulnerabilities. Using this testbed, we examine the capabilities and limitations of PCI scanners and the rigor of the certification process. Our findings reveal a significant gap between the security standard and its real-world enforcement. None of the six PCI scanners we tested fully comply with the PCI scanning guidelines, issuing certificates to merchants with major vulnerabilities. To further assess the compliance status of real-world e-commerce websites, we developed a lightweight scanning tool, PciCheckerLite, and scanned 1,203 e-commerce websites across various business sectors. The results indicate that 86% of the websites have at least one PCI DSS violation that should disqualify them as non-compliant. Our in-depth accuracy analysis also shows that PciCheckerLite’s output is more precise than w3af. We shared our research results with the PCI Security Council to improve practical enforcement.

## 1. Introduction

Payment systems are critical targets for financially motivated attacks. Major card brands, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB, formed the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) to standardize global security requirements. The PCI SSC maintains, updates, and promotes the Data Security Standard (DSS), which defines comprehensive security requirements for payment systems. PCI DSS certification has become a global trademark for secure payment systems. According to PCI DSS, it applies to all entities involved in payment card processing, including merchants, processors, acquirers, issuers, and service providers. It also applies to entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data and sensitive authentication data.

The PCI SSC evaluates the security and compliance status of participants and supervises entities responsible for compliance assessments, such as Qualified Security Assessors (QSAs) and Approved Scanning Vendors (ASVs). All entities in the PCI ecosystem must comply with the standards and obtain compliance reports from authorized entities. For example, merchants must submit their compliance reports to acquirer banks to maintain their business accounts. Similarly, card issuer and acquirer banks must submit their compliance reports to payment brands to maintain their membership status.

However, recent high-profile data breaches have raised concerns about the security of the payment card ecosystem, particularly for e-commerce merchants. A report from Gemini Advisory [21] indicates that 60 million U.S. payment cards were compromised in 2018 alone. Many merchants that experienced data breaches were known to be compliant with PCI DSS. For instance, Target, despite being PCI DSS compliant, leaked 40 million payment card information due to insecure practices within its internal networks in 2013. These incidents raise questions about the practical enforcement of PCI DSS.

In this paper, we address the following questions: How well are the PCI data security standards enforced in practice? Do real-world e-commerce websites meet the PCI data security standards? We design and develop testbeds and tools to quantitatively measure the degree of PCI DSS compliance of PCI scanners and e-commerce merchants. Our results show that the detection capabilities of PCI scanners vary significantly, with even PCI-approved scanners failing to report serious vulnerabilities. We also build a new lightweight scanning tool, PciCheckerLite, and scan 1,203 real-world e-commerce websites, finding that 86% of the websites have at least one PCI DSS violation. Our in-depth accuracy analysis shows that PciCheckerLite’s output is more precise than w3af. We shared our research results with the PCI Security Council to improve practical enforcement.

## 2. Background on PCI and DSS

### 2.1 Payment Card Ecosystem

The Payment Card Industry (PCI) has established a system that allows merchants to accept user payments via payment cards and complete transactions with banks. Figure 1 illustrates the relationships between key players, including users, merchants, and banks. The issuer bank issues payment cards to users and manages their credit or debit card accounts. Users use payment cards at various types of merchants. The acquirer bank manages the merchant's account to receive and route transaction information, ensuring funds are deposited into the merchant’s account once the transaction is complete. The payment network, also known as card brands (e.g., Visa, MasterCard), bridges the acquirer and issuer banks.

Merchants can be categorized into those running e-commerce services (all transactions online) and those with physical storefronts. E-commerce merchants typically interact with the acquirer bank via a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, Square), while physical storefronts use point-of-sale (POS) devices to collect and transfer user card information. Due to the need to store card information, merchants must prove to the bank that they are qualified to handle the information securely. Acquirer banks require these merchants to obtain PCI security certifications to maintain accounts with the bank.

### 2.2 PCI Council and Data Security Standard

The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council manages several specifications to ensure data security across the payment ecosystem. The most important specification is the Data Security Standard (DSS), which is required for issuer banks, acquirer banks, and all types of merchants and e-commerce sites. Our work focuses on DSS compliance.

The PCI DSS specifies 12 requirements that organizations must follow to protect user payment card data. These requirements cover various aspects, including network security, data protection policies, vulnerability management, access control, testing, and personnel management. There are 79 detailed items under the 12 high-level requirements, summarized in Table 9 in the Appendix.

DSS applies to all players in the ecosystem, including merchants and acquirer/issuer banks. Merchants must prove their compliance to the acquirer bank to open a business account, while acquirer and issuer banks must prove their compliance to card brands for membership eligibility.

Table 1 summarizes the PCI compliance levels and their evaluation criteria. Compliance levels are determined by the number of annual financial transactions handled by the organization. Self-assessment questionnaires (SAQs) and security scanning are required quarterly, regardless of the compliance level. On-site audits by QSAs are only required for large organizations handling over 1 million transactions a year.

### 2.3 Threat Model and Method Overview

#### Threat Model

The certification process is designed to enforce high-security standards to protect user data from external adversaries. If the certification process is not well executed, it can allow merchants with security vulnerabilities to store payment card data and interact with banks. Additionally, such security certification may create a false sense of security for merchants. Our focus is on the automatic server screening by PCI scanners, as all merchants must pass the scanning. We also briefly analyze the Self-assessment Questionnaire (SAQs).

#### Methodology Overview

To systematically measure and compare the rigor of the compliance assessment process, we built a semi-functional e-commerce website as a testbed and ordered commercial PCI scanning services to screen and certify the website. The testbed allows us to configure website instances by adding or removing key security vulnerabilities specified by PCI DSS. We used this testbed to perform controlled measurements on the certification process of several PCI scanners. We also empirically measured the security compliance of real-world e-commerce websites, focusing on a selected set of DSS requirements.

## 3. Measurement Methodology

### 3.1 Security Test Cases

Our testbed, BuggyCart, contains 35 test cases, each representing a type of security vulnerability. Running a PCI scanner on the testbed reveals vulnerabilities that the scanner can detect and those it fails to report. We categorize the 35 security test cases into four categories: network security, system security, application security, and secure storage.

- **Network Security (14 test cases):** These include firewall status, access to critical software from the network, default passwords, usage of HTTP to transmit sensitive data, and SSL/TLS misconfigurations.
- **System Security (7 test cases):** These include vulnerable software, server misconfigurations, and HTTP security headers.
- **Web Application Security (8 test cases):** These include SQL injections, secure password guidelines, integrity of JavaScripts from external sources, XSS, and CSRF.
- **Secure Storage (6 test cases):** These include storing sensitive user information, storing and showing PAN in plaintext, and insecure ways of storing passwords. Secure storage is impossible to verify through external scans, so DSS does not require PCI scanners to test these properties.

**Must-fix Vulnerabilities:** Among the 35 cases, 29 are within the scope of ASV scanners and can be remotely tested. After vulnerabilities are detected, website owners must fix any vulnerabilities with a CVSS score ≥ 4.0 and any mandatory PCI DSS vulnerabilities. If the website owner fails to resolve the "must-fix" vulnerabilities, the scanner should not issue the compliance certification.

**Completeness and Excluded Cases:** When building BuggyCart and PciCheckerLite, we excluded five mandatory ASV scanning cases, such as backdoors or malware, DNS server vulnerabilities, mail server vulnerabilities, hypervisor and virtualization component vulnerabilities, and wireless access point vulnerabilities. Most of these involve servers or devices outside our testbed or application server. We also excluded non-mandatory cases.

### 3.2 Testbed Architecture and Implementations

A key challenge in measuring PCI scanners is interacting with them like a real e-commerce website to obtain reliable results. This requires the testbed to incorporate most, if not all, of the e-commerce functionality to reflect the scanners' true performance. We chose OpenCart, a popular open-source PHP-based e-commerce solution, as the base for our testbed. OpenCart supports core e-commerce functionality, such as account registration, shopping cart management, and checkout, allowing us to interact with PCI scanners in a realistic manner.

**Testbed Frontend:** The frontend of our testbed supports core e-commerce functionality, such as account registration, shopping cart management, and checkout and making payment with credit cards.
