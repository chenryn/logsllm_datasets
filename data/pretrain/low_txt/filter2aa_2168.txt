### Lock-and-Key: The Distinguishing Device of Civilization and Enlightenment
- **Quote by Ambrose Bierce**

---

### Let's Talk
#### RoboKey System
- **Developed with the locksport community**
- **Kwikset / Weiser's Smartkey**: Responded to bumping with a complete redesign.
- **ABUS Plus**: Fixed a flaw found by a lockpicker and issued a new challenge.
- **Medeco**: Worked with Jon King to mutually release an exploit.
- **Q&A / Super-secret announcement**

---

### The RoboKey System
- **John Laughlin with Barry Wels of TOOOL**
  - "It's easy to love your own baby, but we wanted to get this out to the community. We figured they wouldn't be shy about telling us what was wrong with it."
  - **John Laughlin, Stanton Concepts**

---

### Background
- **John & Bob Laughlin**
  - John was a communications engineer.
  - Bob was a retired lock engineer.
  - When the telecom industry declined, John started working with his father.
- **Inspiration**
  - Both have a keen interest in security.
  - The world is more focused on security than ever before.
  - Opportunity to address areas that hadn't received adequate scrutiny.
  - Securing containers that change hands multiple times and survive harsh environments.

---

### Basic Operation
- **Disc-Detainer Type Mechanism**
  - Resembles an Abloy-style cylinder.
  - Features combination lock-like components.
  - Extremely rugged for various environmental conditions.
- **Automatic Dialer**
  - Operator does not need to know the combination, just needs to be a valid user.
  - Various authentication methods: password, RFID, embedded dialer in cell phone, matched pair, etc.
- **Manual Dialer**
  - Physical lock can still be operated manually.

---

### Community Scrutiny
- **First Introductions**
  - Bob Laughlin met Han Fey via eBay (both avid collectors).
  - Met in Holland in early 2006 to see the RoboKey System (RKS).
  - Han invited John to the Dutch Open.
- **Dutch Open**
  - "The people were very generous with their knowledge."
  - Panel on viable attacks and applications.
- **ALOA**
  - Attended ALOA with Han and Barry.
  - Showcased RKS and other products.
  - Article in Locksmith Ledger as a result.

---

### Open Source Future
- **Open Source Developer Kits**
  - Looking to license their product.
  - Wanted to get the ball rolling while seeking a deal.
  - Open source software and microcontroller.
  - Add whatever functionality you want.
  - Aiming for a total package (lock & dialer kit) for around $300.
  - John has always kept in touch with the locksport community.
  - Answering questions and fielding commentary about the NDE article at lockpickology.com.

### Smartkey

  - "At least one lock maker says the hobbyists can help companies..."
  - **Wall Street Journal**

---

### Bump in the Night
- **How blind were we?**
  - Walt Strader told the WSJ he heard of bumping via locksport groups in 2006.
  - Smartkey launched as 100% bump-proof.
  - Rekeyable (NOT U-Change).
  - Subdued marketing campaign – no initial mention of bumping.
  - Rigorous testing process.

---

### How Does It Work?
- **Breakdowns courtesy Zeke**

---

### Testing
- **2006 Dutch Open**
  - Prototype from an unnamed company.
  - Arthurmeister! Definite challenge.
  - Japan: Different culture of entry, interesting testing methods.
  - Passed 15-minute attacks with flying colors.

---

### Smartkey 2
- **The New Generation**
  - Updated materials for destructive entry (DE) concerns.
  - Similarly subdued roll-out to the first generation.
  - Now available!
  - **Future**
    - Black and Decker employees now keep an active eye on the locksport community.
    - Led to current advances and additional free feedback.
    - Excited for future collaboration.

### ABUS Plus System
- **Photo & Quote by Jaakko Fagerlund**
  - "I suppose that nobody thought you could actually 'look' behind the discs..."

---

### The Exploit
- **Background**
  - Zeke's Contest: Everyone missed the flaw – forest for the trees.
  - Created proof of concept.
  - **How it works**: Photos courtesy Jaakko Fagerlund.

---

### Simplification
- **Goal**
  - Build the simplest and least expensive version of Jaakko's tool possible.
  - Used the filed-down head of a nail.
  - Tried many impressioning mediums before settling on white glue.

---

### Alerting ABUS
- **First Contact**
  - Arranged by an LP101 member “mh”.
  - Initial response was polite but non-committal.
  - Proof in the pudding: Jaakko's PDF got attention.
- **Response**
  - Brief silence.
  - Updated all current production.
  - Challenged Jaakko to defeat the new mixed cylinder.
  - Jaakko could only get the keys to the lock if he uncovered the bitting.

---

### Current Events
- **Jaakko's ABUS Plus Pick**
  - Community-funded.
  - Successfully picked the challenge lock!

---

### Medecoder
- **Photo & Quote by Jaakko Fagerlund**
  - "I suppose that nobody thought you could actually 'look' behind the discs..."
  - "Who is Jon King and what is he doing with our locks?" – Peter Field, Medeco

---

### Who is this guy?
- **Jon King**
  - JK_the_CJer, JK, etc.
  - Navy
  - Locksport Hobbyist
  - Security Geek
  - **Not speaking on behalf of the Navy or Medeco**

---

### My Obsession
- **Why Medeco?**
  - Holy Grail of pin tumblers.
  - Pins must lift and rotate.
  - Many attempts by the community.
  - **Show me...in one picture**

---

### The Problems
- **Open Grooves**
- **OMG Wire!**
- **Even Spacing**

---

### Humble Beginnings
- **Early tool designs aimed at rotating all pins at once**
  - "I suppose that nobody thought you could actually 'look' behind the discs..."

---

### Let's Simplify
- **Maybe I'll try hooking into one pin first**

---

### The Early Tools
- **+=**

### Purdy

---

### The Community
- **Lockpicking101.com**
  - Schuyler Towne
  - Doug Farre
  - Mitch Capper
  - Everyone else...
- **Public Release & NDE**
  - Wanted to publicly release via NDE Magazine.
  - "Let's get a manufacturer reaction"

---

### Quite A Reaction
- **Peter Field**
  - Head of R&D at Medeco drove to my house.
  - Discussed lock history, other exploits, etc.
- **Closed Grooves**
  - Medeco reimplemented the ARX closed groove pins.

---

### The Future
- **Keep going! Nothing is impossible!**
- **Think before disclosure!**
- **Don't get wrapped up, have fun!**

---

### Final Thoughts
- **Please help**
  - We're getting our feet in the door.
  - Our communities are merging.
  - Physical security disclosure is different from digital security disclosure.
  - Want to help? PI:EMAIL
- **And finally, that super-secret announcement...**

---

### The NDE Grant
- **Mission**
  - Our goal is to help get tools and supplies into the hands of hobbyists who are doing legitimate lock research.
  - Once an exploit is discovered and verified, we work with the researcher(s) to communicate with the manufacturer.
  - I have privately funded a few research projects, but this is not sustainable financially, so I'm opening the funding up to public donations.
