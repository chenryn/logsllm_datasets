## 3. Experimental Results

### 3.1 Data Collection and Feature Selection
The features of a vulnerability are extracted from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. Figure 2 illustrates the model features used for exploit prediction. Features numbered 50 and above represent a list of keywords for counting word frequency. These keywords are all related to cybersecurity, with some specifically mentioning vulnerabilities, exploits, and hacking activities.

### 3.2 Prediction Performance
We used data from 1999 to 2018 as the training period and 2019 as the testing period. To prevent data imbalance, the ratio of exploit samples to non-exploit samples was set to 1:3. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.06%, with a Type I error rate of 1.8% and a Type II error rate of 6.56%. Table 1 lists the exploited CVEs mentioned in 2019. Class 1 indicates that the vulnerability is predicted to be exploited, while class 2 indicates it is predicted not to be exploited. We set a threshold of 0.5 to differentiate between these classes. In Table 1, except for CVE-2017-5487, which has a higher score for class 0 and both scores are close to 0.5, all other CVEs were correctly predicted as class 1 (exploited). The classification accuracy of the Random Forest (RF) model with topic modeling (98.06%) outperformed the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model (92.81%). Therefore, the proposed vulnerability threat prediction model can effectively alert organizations to high-risk vulnerabilities.

**Table 1: Exploited CVEs Mentioned in 2019**

| Class 1 | Class 0 | CVE          |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| 0.98    | 0.02    | CVE-2011-1563 |
| 0.888   | 0.112   | CVE-2016-2056 |
| 0.456   | 0.544   | CVE-2017-5487 |
| 0.614   | 0.386   | CVE-2017-7529 |
| 0.818   | 0.182   | CVE-2018-15708|
| 0.806   | 0.194   | CVE-2018-8847 |
| 0.91    | 0.09    | CVE-2019-10945|
| 0.664   | 0.336   | CVE-2019-4013 |
| 0.894   | 0.106   | CVE-2019-4279 |
| 0.832   | 0.168   | CVE-2019-5514 |

The approach has been integrated into our threat intelligence platform as one of the analytic functions. Figures 3 and 4 show the system's user interface (UI) for vulnerability intelligence. The predicted risk score, named 'SecScore', along with CVSS v2, CVSS v3, and other information, provides decision support for organizations to prioritize their vulnerability patching schedules.

## 4. Conclusion
In this study, we propose a dynamic vulnerability threat assessment model to predict which vulnerabilities will be exploited in the near future and require immediate attention. The novelty of this work lies in addressing the pain point in cyber threat mitigation practice, specifically in information aggregation and prioritization. We believe we are the first to deploy this technology to a threat intelligence platform, enriching the vulnerability intelligence correlated from multiple sources.

Our future work includes:
1. Improving model sustainability by continuing experiments with a moving window mechanism to provide monthly CVE threat assessments.
2. Extending the model to assess the threat level of exploit codes shared on hacker forums or dark web markets without CVE numbers.
3. Continuously suggesting monitored keywords for topic modeling on Twitter data in cybersecurity communities.
