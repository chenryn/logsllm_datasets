In version 3.0, I used the class `class="visible-xs visible-sm"` to display a footer on small devices. After upgrading to version 3.1, the footer no longer appeared. To resolve this issue, I changed the class to `class="hidden-md hidden-lg"`, and the footer was displayed again.

I am uncertain whether this discrepancy is due to an error in version 3.0 or 3.1.
