### 3.5 The Alibi: Voice and IP Traffic

As observed in the previous sections, SMS spammers attempt to reach as many targets as possible by flooding large amounts of messages. This paper primarily focuses on SMS spam analysis. However, we also include voice and IP traffic data in our study, and the results are quite revealing.

#### 3.5.1 Voice Traffic

Spammers make a significantly higher number of phone calls compared to legitimate users, but the number of unique call recipients is much lower (Figures 11a and 11b). This suggests that spammers may be trying to mimic the calling patterns of legitimate users. However, the average duration of these calls is much shorter (Figure 11c), indicating that the recipient often hangs up quickly. This short call duration further suggests that these calls may also be spam.

Unlike in SMS traffic, spammers do not flood a large number of recipients with calls. Instead, they seem to communicate with a small set of numbers that they know will answer, even if the calls are brief.

**Figure 12: Correlation between the Number of Calls and Their Recipients**

- **Figure 12a**: Plots the average number of call destinations per day (y-axis) versus the average number of calls (x-axis) in log-log scale. Spammers cluster around a large number of calls to a small set of destinations, while both cell-phone users and M2M devices make calls to a more proportional set of destinations.
- **Figure 12b**: Plots the average number of SMS destinations (x-axis) against the number of voice call destinations (y-axis). Spammers place phone calls to a much smaller set of recipients compared to their text message targets. Legitimate users, on the other hand, tend to communicate with a larger set of contacts via phone than via text. This can be explained by the fact that cell-phone users rely heavily on SMS for communication with friends and relatives, while phone calls are made to a broader range of contacts, such as restaurants, doctors' offices, etc.

#### 3.5.2 IP Traffic

Finally, we examine IP traffic. Figure 13 shows the distribution of up-link and down-link byte counts for the three account categories under analysis. Spammers generate a small amount of data, consisting of several small transactions.

- **Cell-phone users** and **M2M systems** generate asymmetric IP data traffic. Regular users typically consume more bandwidth in the downlink, such as browsing videos and media, while their uplink traffic is generally lower.
- **M2M appliances**, used mainly for reporting applications like remote alarms and fleet control, generate a larger load in the uplink.

### 4. Stopping the Crime

The results presented in this paper have been used to develop an accurate SMS spam detection engine. A detailed description and the results obtained will be submitted in the near future. Here, we provide a brief overview.

We propose an advanced SMS spam detection algorithm based on an ensemble of decision trees. Over 40 specific features are extracted from messaging patterns and processed through a combination of decision trees. To speed up the spam detection process, the system focuses on features that can be obtained from just one to a few messages. This algorithm also leverages the insights on M2M SMS messaging patterns described in this paper.

### 5. Related Work

SMS spam has not been widely discussed in literature, but there is some work introducing different detection schemes. For example, the authors of [24] propose a detection engine based on analyzing the social network connections of spammers. Other approaches focus on investigating the content of SMS spam messages [12].

There is extensive literature on spam messaging analysis in other communication systems. Email spam is the most widespread type. In this context, [17] presents findings on how spammers harvest large lists of email addresses for their campaigns. [18] studies the network-level behavior of spammers in the email world, finding that spam originates from a few regions of the IP address space, generated by a vast number of bots, each sending only a few emails over short periods.

Email spam has been a known problem for many years, with numerous advanced detection schemes proposed. For instance, [13] studies the effectiveness of DNS blacklisting, and [10] provides a survey of known spam filtering techniques.

Other types of spam and messaging abuse have also been studied. [14] examines the traffic characteristics of tweet spam and propaganda, while [20] and [21] analyze messaging abuse in YouTube comments and the blogosphere, respectively. [9] investigates the risk of sophisticated context-aware spam resulting from information sharing on social networks.

### 6. Conclusions

In this paper, we study the characteristics and traffic patterns of SMS spam accounts based on real cellular network data from a tier-1 provider in the United States. The results are compared against a sample of real traffic from legitimate cellphone users and M2M devices.

- **Pre-paid Accounts**: 99.64% of spammers use pre-paid accounts, with an average age of 7 to 11 days.
- **Hardware Devices**: Spammers show a preference for a small set of hardware devices, with 84% using one of the top 5 spamming tools in the US, and 65% using the top device.
- **Messaging Patterns**: Spammers send two orders of magnitude more messages than cell-phone users and one order of magnitude more than M2M systems. These messages are sent to a wide target list, with a ratio of recipients to messages very close to one. Spammers also receive a large number of messages, though the number of incoming SMS is relatively low.
- **Geolocation Data**: Major spamming hot-spots in the US include Sacramento, Los Angeles-Orange County, and Miami Beach. Spammers launch geographically distributed campaigns targeting all area codes uniformly, with some focusing on specific areas.
- **Mobility**: Spammers are often mobile within their local area.
- **Voice and Data Traffic**: Spammers generate a large number of very short phone calls and data transactions with a very small number of endpoints, possibly to mislead spam detection filters by mimicking human-like network traffic behavior.

Our analysis indicates that certain M2M systems exhibit messaging behavior similar to spammers. A small number of M2M devices transmit a large number of SMSs per day, communicating with a large number of destinations. These devices should be considered when designing SMS spam detection and filtering schemes to avoid blocking or mislabeling legitimate text messages.

The results presented in this paper are being used to design an advanced SMS spam detection system.
