### Summary of the New Feature

I would like to customize the shell used by PowerToys Run for launching commands that start with `>`. For example, I want to use PowerShell Core instead of the default Command Prompt (cmd). There are several options available for this customization:

- **Command Prompt (cmd)**
- **PowerShell**
- **PowerShell Core**
- **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**
- **Custom Shell** (e.g., Git Bash, Zsh, etc.)
  - Example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\MyShell\customshell.exe --interactive --command "{0}"`

In the custom shell command, `{0}` can be used as a placeholder for the shell command.
