### Indicators for Retraining Classifiers

Two key indicators can signal the need for retraining classifiers to maintain their accuracy and effectiveness:

1. **Unlabeled Flows**: The first indicator is the number of flows that are not assigned a label. An increase in this number suggests that the classifier is struggling to recognize certain flow types, indicating the need for retraining to capture underrepresented flow types and improve classification accuracy.

2. **Average Distance to Nearest Cluster Mean**: The second indicator is the average distance of new flows to their nearest cluster mean. A significant increase in this distance indicates that the new flows are dissimilar to the existing clusters, suggesting that the classifier needs to be retrained to adapt to these changes.

### Future Work: Addressing Changing Class Distributions

In future work, we plan to address the problem of changing class distributions by developing new strategies for system updates and classifier retraining. One potential approach is to count the flows of known classes recognized during a system update. If the number of these flows increases, it indicates that the class distributions of the corresponding known classes have changed, and the traffic classifier should be retrained. This adaptive approach will help ensure that the classifier remains effective even as the data distribution evolves.

### Experimental Validation

To validate our theoretical analysis, we conducted several traffic classification experiments using a dataset that excluded zero-day traffic. We applied the Random Forest algorithm for supervised traffic classification and implemented the Bag-of-Flows (BoF) method by combining the Random Forest algorithm with a majority vote rule. The classification error was used as the primary metric to evaluate the performance.

**Figure 11** shows the actual error rates versus the estimated error rates. The results demonstrate that the estimated BoF error rate, calculated using equation (12), closely matches the actual BoF error rate, outperforming the error rate estimated using equation (10). This indicates that, given the flow error rate, we can accurately estimate the BoF error rate based on the average number of sub-bags in a BoF. In our real traffic traces, the average number of sub-bags in BoFs was consistently greater than 2, suggesting that the BoF model effectively incorporates flow correlation into traffic identification, thereby supporting the new scheme presented in this paper.

### Optimizing the RTC Scheme

Based on the above analysis, one idea to optimize the proposed Robust Traffic Classification (RTC) scheme is to randomly select a flow to represent a sub-bag, thus speeding up the classification process for practical applications. For example, in our complex traffic dataset, there are 638,388 flows, 64,444 BoFs, and 165,858 sub-bags. By applying the sub-bag concept, the scheme would only need to classify 165,858 flows instead of the entire dataset (638,388 flows) before prediction aggregation. This approach could reduce the classification time to approximately one-fourth of that required by the original scheme. We have evaluated the performance of this optimized scheme and found it to be highly effective.

### Conclusion

This paper addresses the challenge of zero-day applications in Internet traffic classification. Conventional methods often suffer from poor performance when zero-day applications are present due to misclassification of zero-day traffic into predefined known classes. We propose a novel robust traffic classification scheme, RTC, which can identify zero-day traffic and accurately classify traffic generated by predefined application classes. The proposed scheme consists of three key modules: unknown discovery, BoF-based traffic classification, and system update. Our formal analysis highlights the performance benefits of incorporating flow correlation into traffic classification. We developed a new optimization method to intelligently tune the parameters of the RTC scheme. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic traces demonstrated that the proposed RTC scheme significantly outperformed four state-of-the-art methods.
