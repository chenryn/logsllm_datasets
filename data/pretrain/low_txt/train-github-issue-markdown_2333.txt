When developing a native add-on for Electron on the Windows platform, `node-gyp` retrieves the necessary `.lib` files for linking from the URL: `https://atom.io/download/electron//win-x86/node.lib`. It appears that this link is currently accessible only for Electron versions 4.0.0 and above, while requests for earlier versions result in a 404 error. This change seems to be unintentional, as there has been no official announcement regarding the discontinuation of support for these older versions.
