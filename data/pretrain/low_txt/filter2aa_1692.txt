## Introduction
### Background
- A friend constantly requested tuning file changes for his car.
- This sparked the interest in exploring ECU hacking.

### Objectives
- Hack the ECU to modify tuning files.
- Conduct forensic analysis after a car crash.

## Vehicle Electronic Control Units (ECUs)
### Overview
- Each ECU has a unique ID in the network.
- They have authentication/encryption protection against unauthorized access.
- Data is stored for diagnostic, forensic, and configuration purposes.

### Communication Protocols
- **K-Line**: 
  - Implemented with a single level shifter IC.
  - Present in most cars before 2010.
  - Older ECUs (K-Line + CAN) are cheaper than newer ones (CAN only).
  - Suitable for developers.
- **CANbus**:
  - We have implemented it, but the beta tool is not yet ready for showcase.
  - Encryption, authentication, and other security features are the same on both K-Line and CANbus.
  - Adding CANbus support increases the tool cost by $10.

## First Steps
### Initial Knowledge
- ECUs are expensive.
- They are typically found inside cars.
- Options:
  - Navigate through technical documentation.
  - Use a logic analyzer (LA) to understand the ECU's operation.
  - Both approaches were used.

### Engine ECU Features
- Manages engine functions.
- Stores all engine faults.
- Contains immobilizer routines.
- Affects the car's behavior through firmware.

### Target Hardware
- Internal/External Flash
- Internal/External EEPROM
- Annoying black rubber-like epoxy

### Logic Analyzer Findings
- **Replay Attack**: Attempted with mixed results.
- **Realizations**:
  - **EDC15/ME7xx**:
    - Seed/Key Algorithm for authentication (unique).
    - Checksum.
    - Requires a loader for operations.
  - **EDC16/MED9xx**:
    - Seed/Key Algorithm for authentication (3 levels).
    - RSA Encryption.
    - Checksum.

## Implementation
### Why It's Interesting
- Save money on gas.
- Modify ECU firmware to increase horsepower.
- Repair faulty ECUs using inexpensive hardware.
- Cool to hack your car with cheap hardware.

### Tool Code
- Limited by the Atmega 328p MCU (2KB RAM).
- EDC15 and ECU16 firmwares each have ~1800 lines of code.
- Working on a universal firmware to handle all types of ECUs without requiring updates.

### Bosch EDC15 and EDC16
- **EDC15**:
  - EEPROM, MCU, Flash.
  - Authentication.
- **EDC16**:
  - MCU + EEPROM + Internal Flash + External Flash.
  - JTAG (BDM).
  - Three-level authentication.
  - RSA encryption required for uploaded files.

### RSA Encryption
- Coded in ASM instructions.
- Takes approximately 10 seconds to encode 512kB.
- Performed before ECU initialization and checksum calculation.

## Existing Tools
- Require PC connection.
- Examples:
  - MAGPRO2 BASE kit: $2300
  - CMD Flash Master OBD: $5500
  - MPPS Master OBD tool: $1500

## ECU Tool Hardware
- Arduino Mini Pro (MCU): $3.17
- SI9241/MC33290 (ISO-9141 level converter): $3
- LM7805 (Voltage regulator): $0.99
- i2C 20x4 LCD: $9.53
- Push buttons + resistors: $1.5
- RJ-45 Female connector: $0.99
- OBD2 Connector: $0.99
- Cat-5/6E Ethernet cable: $1
- RJ-45 male connector: $0.1
- SD card Breakout board + 2GB SD card: $3
- Plastic case: $2
- **Total Cost**: $26.27

### Tool Features
- Not locked to a single vehicle.
- Stores non-encrypted files.
- No master/slave role.
- Can be used as a sniffer.
- Easy to add support for additional functions or ECU units.

## Examples of Use
### Modifying ECU Firmware
- Connect via OBD2.
- Download original file from ECU.
- Modify file on PC.
- Place the file in the correct folder.
- Upload tuned file to ECU.
- Revert to original in less than a minute.

### Bypassing Immobilizer (EDC15)
- Plug the tool via OBD2.
- Select "Disable IMMO" option.
- Hotwire the car or use the ECU in other cars.
- Enable/disable immo easily with the menu.

### Disabling a Car
- Connect the tool via OBD2.
- Select "Write file to flash".
- Pull the cable before the operation finishes (causes wrong checksum).
- Recover the ECU with automatic recovery mode.

### Creepy Example
- Place a mini device in the OBD port with 3G.
- Remotely control the car.
- Dangerous and can cause accidents.

## Demo on EDC16
- Read info.
- Read flash.
- Disable the ECU.
- Try to read info again (will fail).
- Recover the ECU.
- Read info on recovered ECU.

## Forensics
### Crash Date Retrieval (CDR)
- Most cars from 1994 store crash data.
- Similar to an airplane black box.
- Stores information before and after the crash (speed, RPM, brake use, etc.).

### Data Storage
- Stored in the airbag ECU (EEPROM).
- Requires costly hardware and software to retrieve and interpret.

### Official Hardware
- BOSCH CDR Premium Tool Hardware Kit: $8999.
- Three ways to connect:
  - OBD port (authentication required).
  - Airbag module (authentication required).
  - Directly read EEPROM memory (no authentication required).

### Poor Guy's Solution
- Software is free.
- Parse the data using available code.

### Supported Vehicles
- A client requested a forensic job on a Mercedes not supported by CDR.
- Read directly from the EEPROM.
- Reset the crash file data and performed a bindiff.
- Used WinOLS to view graphs and distinguish speed during the crash.

## Conclusion
- Thank you to everyone for attending.
- Special thanks to family and friends.
- For those who want to understand how and why things work.
