### 7.5.4 Cleaning Up Event History

**Overview:**
- Unlike shadow table history (Section 7.5.2) and replication history (Section 7.5.3), event history is neither viewable nor removable using the xDB Replication Console.
- Event history records various updates to the control schema tables during xDB Replication Server processing, leading to significant growth over time.

**Tables to Be Cleaned Up:**
- `xdb_events`
- `xdb_events_status`
- `xdb_pub_replog`
- `xdb_pub_table_replog`

**Table Locations:**
- **Oracle:** These tables are located in the schema of the publication database user.
- **SQL Server and Postgres:** These tables are located in the `_edb_replicator_pub` schema.

**Automatic Cleanup:**
- The event and replication history data in the control schema are deleted daily at 12 AM.
- The `historyCleanupDaysThreshold` configuration option allows you to specify how old the completed data must be before it is removed. The default setting is seven days.
- To clean up all completed event and replication history regardless of age, set `historyCleanupDaysThreshold` to 0 and restart the publication server. The cleanup will occur during the next scheduled 12 AM process.

**Configuration Option:**
- For more information on the `historyCleanupDaysThreshold` option, see Section 10.4.1.10.

### 7.6 Managing a Publication

**Introduction:**
- After creating a publication, certain attributes of the underlying replication system environment may change, such as network locations, user names, and passwords.
- This section describes how to update the metadata stored for the publication server, the publication database definition, and publications to keep the information consistent with the actual replication system environment.

### 7.6.1 Updating a Publication Server

**Metadata Updates:**
- There are two aspects of metadata related to the publication server that may need to be updated:
  1. **Network Location, Admin User Name, or Password:**
     - If the network location (IP address or port number), admin user name, or password of the publication server changes, update the server login file with the new information.
  2. **Subscription Server Network Location:**
     - If the network location of a subscription server changes, update the publication server’s metadata with the new network location. This applies only to single-master replication systems.

**Updating the Server Login File:**
- Follow these steps to update the publication server’s login information in the server login file:

1. **Start the Publication Server:**
   - Ensure the publication server is running. For directions on starting the publication server, see Section 5.2.1.

2. **Open the Update Publication Server Dialog Box:**
   - Right-click on the Publication Server node and choose "Update." The "Update Publication Server" dialog box will appear.

   **Figure 7-59: Update Publication Server Dialog Box**

3. **Complete the Fields:**
   - Enter the correct IP address, port number, admin user name, and password.
   - Check the "Save Login Information" box if you want the new login information saved in the server login file.

   **Figure 7-60: Updated Publication Server Location**

4. **Update the Login File:**
   - Click the "Update" button. If the dialog box closes, the update was successful.
   - Click the "Refresh" icon in the xDB Replication Console toolbar to show the updated Publication Server node.

### 7.6.2 Updating a Publication Database

**Introduction:**
- When you create a publication database definition, you save the publication database server’s network location, database identifier, a database login user name, and the user’s password in the control schema.
- This section shows you how to update the publication database login information stored in the control schema if any of these attributes change.

**Attributes You Must Not Change:**
- Oracle login user name
- Database server network location if it references a different server
- Database identifier if it references a different physical database

**Attributes You May Change:**
- Login user name’s password
- Database server network location if the corresponding location change was made
- Database identifier if the corresponding name change was made

**Steps to Update:**

1. **Ensure the Database Server is Running:**
   - Make sure the database server is running and accepting client connections.

2. **Start and Register the Publication Server:**
   - Ensure the publication server is running and registered in the xDB Replication Console. See Section 5.2.1 for directions.

3. **Select the Publication Database Node:**
   - Select the Publication Database node corresponding to the publication database definition you wish to update.

   **Figure 7-64: Selecting a Publication Database Definition for Update**

4. **Open the Update Database Source Dialog Box:**
   - From the Publication menu, choose "Publication Database," then "Update Database."
   - Alternatively, right-click on the Publication Database node and choose "Update Database."

### 7.6.3 Updating a Publication

**Ways to Update Existing Publications:**
- Add tables to the publication
- Remove tables from the publication
- Update filter rules on publication tables

#### 7.6.3.1 Adding Tables to a Publication

**For Single-Master Replication (SMR):**
- You can add tables to a publication even while there are existing subscriptions associated with the publication.

**For Multi-Master Replication (MMR):**
- You can add tables to a publication while there are additional master nodes in the replication system.

**Steps to Add Tables:**

1. **Start and Register the Publication Server:**
   - Ensure the publication server is running and registered in the xDB Replication Console. See Section 5.2.1 for directions.

2. **Select the Publication Node:**
   - **For SMR:** Select the Publication node of the publication to which you wish to add tables.
   - **For MMR:** Select the Publication node under the Publication Database node representing the master definition node.

   **Figure 7-68: Selecting a Publication to Add Tables**

3. **Open the Add Tables Dialog Box:**
   - From the Publication menu, choose "Update Publication," then "Add Tables."
   - Alternatively, right-click on the Publication node, choose "Update Publication," and then "Add Tables."
   - Or, click the "Add Publication Tables" icon.

   **Figure 7-69: Opening the Add Tables Dialog Box**

4. **Fill in the Fields:**
   - In the "Add Tables" tab, check the boxes next to the table names from the "Available Tables" list that you want to add to the publication.
   - If the publication is a snapshot-only publication, views will also appear in the "Available Tables" list.
   - Use the "Use Wildcard Selection" button for wildcard pattern matching.

   **Figure 7-70: Add Tables Dialog Box**

5. **(Optional) Define Filter Rules:**
   - If you want to filter the rows of the publication tables or views, click the "Table Filters" tab.
   - Enter a unique, descriptive filter name and an appropriate SQL WHERE clause in the "Filter" dialog box to select the rows you want to replicate.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and update your publication settings to ensure they remain consistent with the current replication system environment.
