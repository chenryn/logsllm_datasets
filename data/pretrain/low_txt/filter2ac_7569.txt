**Title: Black Hat Asia 2020 - Winning the 0-Day Race Against Botnets in Public Clouds**

Botnets pose a significant threat to public cloud environments, often exploiting new vulnerabilities (0-days) to disrupt large portions of the internet. As a cloud service provider, we have developed an automated 0-day monitoring solution to detect and block attacks before botnets can cause damage. In early 2019, our system successfully captured the world's first WebLogic RCE (CVE-2019-2725) 0-day payload, protecting thousands of cloud servers from the Muhstik botnet.

In this presentation, we will delve into the technical details of how our system automatically captures 0-day attack payloads without prior knowledge of specific vulnerability details. We will also present real-world case studies to demonstrate the performance of our models and share the results of our 0-day monitoring efforts.
