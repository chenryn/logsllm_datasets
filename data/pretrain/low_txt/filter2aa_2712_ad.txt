#### Creating Windows User Accounts in a Read/Write Directory Domain

You can use Workgroup Manager to create Windows user accounts in directory domains other than the LDAP directory domain of a server that is a primary domain controller (PDC). If Mac OS X Server provides Windows services, you can create Windows user accounts in the server’s local directory domain. If the server is connected to another server's LDAP directory domain, you can also create Windows user accounts there, provided it is configured for write access.

- **User Account Limitations:**
  - User accounts in the local directory domain or another server’s LDAP directory domain cannot be used for Windows domain login.
  - These accounts can access other services, such as Windows file service, if the server hosting the service has an authentication search policy that includes the directory domain where the user account resides.

**To create a user account in a read/write directory domain:**

1. **Ensure Access to the Directory Domain:**
   - The directory services of the Mac OS X Server must be configured to access the desired domain. Use Directory Access to configure access to another server’s LDAP directory domain. Refer to the Open Directory administration guide for instructions.

2. **Open Workgroup Manager:**
   - Click **Accounts**, then click the **User** button.
   - Open the directory domain where you want to create user accounts and authenticate as an administrator. To open a directory domain, click the small globe icon above the list of users and choose from the pop-up menu. To authenticate, click the lock icon and enter the name and password of an administrator whose password type is Open Directory.

3. **Create the New User:**
   - Choose **Server > New User** or click the **New User** button in the toolbar.
   - Specify the user settings in the provided tabs. For detailed instructions, see “Working With Basic Settings for Users” on page 33 through “Working With Print Settings for Users” on page 37.
   - You can also use a preset or an import file to create a new user. For more information, refer to the user management guide.

#### Editing Windows User Accounts

You can use Workgroup Manager to modify a Windows user account, whether it resides on a Mac OS X Server that is the PDC or in another directory domain.

**To edit a user account:**

1. **Ensure Access to the Directory Domain:**
   - The directory services of the Mac OS X Server must be configured to access the desired domain. Use Directory Access to configure access to another server’s LDAP directory domain. Refer to the Open Directory administration guide for instructions.

2. **Open Workgroup Manager:**
   - Click **Accounts**, then click the **User** button.
   - Open the directory domain where you want to edit user accounts and authenticate as an administrator. To open a directory domain, click the small globe icon above the list of users and choose from the pop-up menu. To authenticate, click the lock icon and enter the name and password of an administrator whose password type is Open Directory.

3. **Select and Edit the Account:**
   - Select the account you want to edit.
   - Change the user settings in the provided tabs. For detailed instructions, see “Working With Basic Settings for Users” on page 33 through “Working With Print Settings for Users” on page 37.

#### Working with Basic Settings for Users

Basic settings are essential attributes that must be defined for all users. You work with these settings in the **Basic** pane of a Workgroup Manager user account window. For detailed instructions, see the chapter on user accounts in the user management guide.

- Defining user names
- Defining short names
- Choosing stable short names
- Avoiding duplicate names
- Avoiding duplicate short names
- Defining user IDs
- Defining passwords
- Assigning administrator rights for a server
- Assigning administrator rights for a directory domain

#### Working with Windows Settings for Users

A user account that can log in to a Windows domain has settings for a Windows home directory, a roaming user profile, and a Windows login script. You can work with these settings in the **Windows** pane of a Workgroup Manager user account window.

**To configure Windows settings for a user account:**

1. **Open the User Account:**
   - In Workgroup Manager, open the user account you want to configure. To open an account, click the **Accounts** button, then click the small globe icon below the toolbar and open the directory domain where the user’s account resides. To edit the Windows settings, click the lock to be authenticated, and then select the user in the user list.

2. **Change the Settings:**
   - **User Profile Path:** Specifies the path to the user’s profile. Leave this blank to use the default share point for user profiles, which is `/Users/Profiles/` on the PDC server.
   - **Login Script:** Specifies the relative path to a login script located in `/etc/logon` on the PDC server.
   - **Hard Drive:** Specifies the drive letter that Windows maps to the user’s home directory. If left blank, drive letter H is used.
   - **Path:** Specifies the path to the user’s home directory. Leave this blank to use the same home directory for both Windows and Mac OS X logins, as specified on the **Home** pane of Workgroup Manager.

3. **Save the Changes:**
   - Click **Save**.

For additional information, see “Setting Up a Home Directory for a Windows User” on page 36 and “Managing SMB Share Points” on page 41.

#### Providing Secure Authentication for Windows Users

Mac OS X Server offers three secure methods to validate the passwords of Windows users:

- **Open Directory Password Server:** Recommended, stores passwords securely, supports many authentication methods, and allows implementing password policies.
- **Shadow Password:** Provides NT and LAN Manager authentication for user accounts stored in the local NetInfo domain.
- **Crypt Password with Authentication Manager Enabled:** A legacy technology for compatibility with upgraded servers.

For more information, refer to the Open Directory administration guide.

#### Managing Groups for Windows Users

A group account simplifies managing a collection of users with similar needs. Group accounts store the identities of users and can be assigned special access privileges to files and folders.

**Procedures for Managing Group Accounts:**

- Creating group accounts
- Editing group account information
- Adding users to a group
- Removing users from a group
- Naming a group
- Defining a group ID
- Deleting a group account

For detailed instructions, see the chapter on group accounts in the user management guide.

#### Managing Windows Workstations in the Windows Computers Account

Every Windows computer supported by the Mac OS X Server PDC must be part of the Windows Computers account. Adding a computer to this account creates a computer record that identifies the Windows computer by its NetBIOS name and contains information for authenticating the computer as a trusted workstation in the Windows domain.

**To add computers to the Windows Computers account:**

1. **Open Workgroup Manager:**
   - Click **Accounts**, then click the **Computers** button.
   - Open the LDAP directory domain and authenticate as an administrator. To open the LDAP directory domain, click the small globe icon above the list of computers and choose from the pop-up menu. To authenticate, click the lock icon and enter the name and password of a directory domain administrator.
