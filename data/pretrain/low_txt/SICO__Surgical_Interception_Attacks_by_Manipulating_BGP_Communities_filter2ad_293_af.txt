### Appendix A: Router Preference Decision Factors

Multi-Exit Discriminators (MEDs) are compared before the IGP metric, but MEDs are often disabled on many BGP sessions and are not relevant to these attacks. Thus, we study routing decisions in the absence of MEDs. There are other tie-breakers before the IGP metric that always tie for externally learned Internet routes, and there are several tie-breakers after the IGP metric that behave similarly to the IGP metric because they are also functions of what External BGP (eBGP) session a route was learned on (like the router-id tie-breaker). Although route selection is arbitrarily configurable and varies by vendor, the model we present works as an effective abstraction.

### Appendix B: Other Methods of Achieving Interception

BGP communities offer a fine-grained method of controlling announcement propagation, but they are not universally supported. An adversary may have a provider that does not forward communities. However, an adversary can still exploit discrepancies in routing policies that shape announcement propagation to achieve interception.

Consider a scenario where providers A and B do not have peering links and are customers of the sets of tier-1 providers A and B, respectively. The victim is a customer of the set of tier-1s V. Assuming there is no overlap between V and B (if there is indeed overlap between V and B, the adversary’s job is easier), an adversary must:

1. Find a route filtering policy that is applied to customer routes and is used by providers in A ∩ B but is not used by at least one provider in A − B.
2. Find B’s most preferred tier-1 provider (in the case of routes with equal AS paths) and find a route filtering policy that is applied to peer routes and is used by this provider.

Because routing policies vary, it is possible for an adversary to find required policies that match the above criteria. Below are some such policies:

- **RPKI Route Origin Validation (ROV)**: The adoption of RPKI has been growing, and so is the adoption of filtering policies that drop routes with invalid RPKI origins. However, these policies are inconsistent across ASes (not only do some tier-1s perform validation while others don’t, whether validation is performed on peer-learned routes, client-learned routes, or both is also inconsistent [5, 48]), potentially allowing an adversary to make an RPKI invalid BGP announcement that will be dropped by select ASes, thus enabling interception. Although the announcement may be more suspicious given that it is RPKI invalid (although some routes in the global route table are RPKI invalid [35, 56, 65]), this may be compensated by the increased stealthiness gained through interception.

- **Defensive AS-path Filtering**: As mentioned in [79], some ASes filter customer routes that contain the ASN of large peer networks anywhere in the AS path. However, which providers implement this policy and the exact ASNs that cause these routes to be filtered vary. Through exploration with its own prefix, an adversary can find which ASNs in the AS path will cause the route not to be imported at select tier-1s. Importantly, each ASN in the AS path has the downside of making the announcement longer and thus attracting less Internet traffic (as outlined in §5.3). However, such a strategy can potentially be carried out with a single ASN that will cause filtering at the required tier-1s while path poisoning may require a greater number of ASNs to be successful.

- **Route Flap Dampening (RFD)**: Route Flap Dampening (RFD) is another routing policy that has varying support at tier-1s [5, 23]. An adversary can continually modify its announcements to trigger RFD at tier-1s that implement it (and maintain a route to the victim) while allowing other tier-1s to still propagate the adversary’s route.

Through manual inspection of routing policies and usage guides, we verified community support for the top 30 ISPs (in Table 10) and the top 10 Internet exchanges (in Table 11) as stated in routing policy documents.
