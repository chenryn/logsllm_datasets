In the `configurationAttributes` section of the debuggers extension point, many attributes are common to both 'launch' and 'attach' request types. Currently, these attributes must be duplicated for each request type. To improve this, we should introduce top-level attribute definitions within the `configurationAttributes` section. These top-level attributes would be shared across different request types, eliminating the need for duplication.
