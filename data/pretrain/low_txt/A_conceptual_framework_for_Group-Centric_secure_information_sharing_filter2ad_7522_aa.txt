## Abstract

In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for developing a family of models for Group-Centric information sharing. The traditional approach to information sharing, characterized as Dissemination-Centric, focuses on attaching attributes and policies to an object (often referred to as "sticky policies") as it is disseminated from producers to consumers in a system. In contrast, Group-Centric sharing envisions bringing subjects and objects together within a group to facilitate sharing. This can be visualized as a secure meeting room where participants and information come together for a common purpose. Another metaphor is the subscription model, where joining users may or may not be authorized to access past content based on policy.

We argue that in such contexts, authorizations are influenced by the temporal ordering of subject and object group membership and the nature of membership operations. For example, some subjects may only get future information added to the group, while others may also access previously added information. We develop a lattice of models based on variations of these basic membership operations and discuss usage scenarios to illustrate practical applications of this lattice.

Two principles guide Group-Centric models:
1. "Share but differentiate," which promotes sharing while differentiating user authorizations based on the temporal aspect of membership.
2. "Groups within groups," which advocates relationships (such as hierarchies) between multiple groups.

In this paper, we focus on read accesses within a single group.

## 1. Introduction

This paper introduces the concept of Group-Centric Secure Information Sharing (g-SIS) and provides a conceptual framework to develop a family of models. The traditional approach to information sharing, characterized as Dissemination-Centric, focuses on attaching attributes and policies to an object as it is disseminated from producers to consumers in a system. These policies, often described as "sticky," may be modified as the object moves down the supply chain, with such modifications controlled by existing policies. This mode of information sharing has roots in early discussions on originator-control systems in the 1980s and Digital Rights Management in the 1990s and 2000s. Examples of policy languages developed for this purpose include XrML, ODRL, and XACML.

Group-Centric sharing, in contrast, advocates bringing subjects and objects together to facilitate sharing. The metaphor is that of a secure meeting room where participants and information come together for a common purpose. This common purpose can range from collaboration on a specific task, such as designing a new product, to participation in a shared activity, such as a semester-long class, to subscribing to a magazine where the publisher contributes information that participants can read and possibly respond to in associated blogs and forums.

Another metaphor is the subscription model, where subscribers can receive content depending on when their subscription began. For example, a subscriber may be allowed to access only new content published after they paid for the subscription, or they may also be allowed to access the archives, depending on the type of subscription.

These metaphors illustrate two important principles in the Group-Centric approach:
1. **"Share but differentiate":** Sharing is enabled by joining and adding information to the group, but users' access is differentiated by the time at which they join and the time at which the requested information is added to the group.
2. **"Groups within groups":** In a given g-SIS system, there may be multiple groups, and the relationships between these groups can be of any type, including hierarchical structures where subjects at higher levels have more read access than those at lower levels.

We envision that Dissemination-Centric and Group-Centric sharing will co-exist in a mutually supportive manner. For example, objects could be added with "sticky" policies in a Group-Centric model, where the objects may have controls imposed by both the Group-Centric model and the "sticky" policies. The "sticky" policies on the object could also determine whether or not an object can be added to the group in the first place.

In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for developing a family of models for g-SIS. We propose an abstract set of group operations: Join and Leave for subjects, Add and Remove for objects. Subjects may Join, Leave, and possibly re-Join the group, as illustrated in Figure 1. Similarly, objects may be Added, Removed, and re-Added to the group. Each of these operations can have many different types. For example, a Strict Join will only allow a joining subject to access objects added to the group after the Join time, while a Liberal Join will allow the subject to access objects added before the Join time as well.

Authorizations concerning who controls Join, Leave, Add, and Remove are addressed as administrative tasks expressed in an administrative model. While a g-SIS administrative model is important, many approaches have been considered in the literature. The administrative model is likely to be application-dependent. For example, in one g-SIS application, users may need to pay to join a group, while in another, users may be admitted based on organizational needs. Without a clear understanding of the operational semantics, an administrative model would be premature.

We believe that authorizations concerning the operational aspects that bear on group membership are a more interesting and novel problem, and this will be the focus of this paper. We leave the development of an administrative g-SIS model for future work. Furthermore, we confine our attention to correct authorization behavior with respect to read access in a single group. We have developed extensions to other forms of access, such as write or update, and multiple groups, but discussion of these is out of scope for this paper.

## 2. A Family of G-SIS Models

We now discuss a family of g-SIS models based on specific variations of subject and object operations (Join, Leave, Add, and Remove). The semantics of these variations are based on the temporal ordering of subject and object group memberships. However, there may be additional semantics beyond those identified here.

### 2.1 Variations of Join and Leave Operations

- **Strict Join (SJ) vs. Liberal Join (LJ):** 
  - In SJ, the joining subject can access only those objects added after the Join time.
  - In LJ, the joining subject can additionally access objects that were added prior to the Join time.

- **Strict Leave (SL) vs. Liberal Leave (LL):**
  - In SL, the leaving subject loses access to all objects.
  - In LL, the leaving subject retains access to objects authorized prior to the Leave time.

For example, in Figure 2, if the second Join (s1) is an SJ, then s1 can only access o4 and o5. If the Join was an LJ instead, s1 can also access o2 and o3.

### 2.2 Variations of Add and Remove Operations

- **Strict Add (SA) vs. Liberal Add (LA):**
  - In SA, the added object is accessible only to subjects who joined the group before the object was added.
  - In LA, the added object is accessible to all current and future subjects.

- **Strict Remove (SR) vs. Liberal Remove (LR):**
  - In SR, the removed object is no longer accessible to any subject.
  - In LR, the removed object remains accessible to subjects who had access to it before the removal.

An authorization policy can be formally specified for each of these 16 models, specifying the conditions under which a subject may access an object. For example, in the (SJ, SL, SA, SR) model, authorization will succeed if the requested object was added after the subject joined the group and both the subject and object are still current group members at the time of request. This can be precisely specified using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL).
