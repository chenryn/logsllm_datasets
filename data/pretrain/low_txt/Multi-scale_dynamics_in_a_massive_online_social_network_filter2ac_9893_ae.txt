### Figure 7: Comparing Activity of Users Inside and Outside Communities

- **(a) Edge Inter-Arrival Time**
  - Community nodes create edges more frequently than non-community nodes.
  - The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of edge inter-arrival times shows that community members are more active in forming new connections.

- **(b) Node Lifetime**
  - Community users are grouped by their community sizes, represented as [x, y] for communities of size between x and y.
  - Community nodes remain active longer than non-community nodes.
  - The lifetime distribution indicates that users in larger communities tend to have longer lifetimes.

- **(c) In-Degree Ratio**
  - The in-degree ratio measures the proportion of a node's incoming edges from within its own community.
  - Nodes in larger communities are more likely to interact with other nodes within the same community, as indicated by a higher in-degree ratio.

**Figure 8: Verification of Results Using the Absolute Potts Model (APM) Community Detection Algorithm**

- **(a) Edge Inter-Arrival Time**
  - The CDF of edge inter-arrival times for users in and out of communities, detected using APM, confirms that community members are more active in creating new connections.

- **(b) Node Lifetime**
  - The node lifetime distribution for different community sizes, detected using APM, shows that users in larger communities have longer lifetimes.

- **(c) In-Degree Ratio**
  - The in-degree ratio distribution, detected using APM, indicates that users in larger communities are more likely to connect with peers within the same community.

**Verification by Alternative Community Detection Algorithm**

- To ensure our results are not biased by the choice of community detection algorithm, we validate a subset of our findings using the Absolute Potts Model (APM).
- The APM algorithm minimizes a metric from the Potts model, which describes the network energy under a given partition. The formal definition is:
  \[
  H = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} (A_{ij} - \gamma J_{ij}) \delta(\sigma_i, \sigma_j)
  \]
  where \( A_{ij} \) is the adjacency matrix element, \( J_{ij} = (1 - A_{ij}) \) represents missing edges, and \( \delta(\sigma_i, \sigma_j) \) is 1 if nodes \( i \) and \( j \) are in the same community, otherwise 0. The parameter \( \gamma \) (set to 0.0001 in our experiment) weights the strength of missing edges.

- We run the APM on the first-year network data (snapshots 20 to 383) and find that the results are qualitatively consistent with those obtained using the incremental Louvain approach. This confirms that our choice of community detection algorithm does not significantly skew our analytical results.

**Summary of Key Findings**

- Our social network exhibits a strong community structure, with community sizes following a power-law distribution.
- Most communities are short-lived and quickly merge into larger ones. These merge events can be predicted using structural features and dynamic metrics.
- Community membership significantly influences user activity. Community users create edges more frequently, exhibit longer lifetimes, and tend to interact more with peers within the same community.

### Merging of Two Online Social Networks (OSNs)

**Background**

- On December 12, 2006, our large Chinese OSN (network X) merged with a competing OSN (network Y).
- Network X, launched in November 2005, had 624K active users and 8.2M edges before the merge.
- Network Y, launched in April 2006, had 670K active users and 3M edges before the merge.
- During the merge, both networks were locked, and all information from network Y was imported into network X's databases. Users could then log in and send friend requests normally.

**Definitions**

- **External Edges**: Connect users from network X to users in network Y.
- **Internal Edges**: Connect users within the same OSN.
- **New Edges**: Connect users in either OSN with new users who joined the combined network after the merge.
- **Activity Threshold**: A user is considered active if they have created an edge within the last 94 days.

**Measuring the Merge**

- **User Activity Over Time**
  - **Figure 9(a)**: Number of active users over time for network X.
  - **Figure 9(b)**: Number of active users over time for network Y.
  - Accounts inactive on the first day after the merge are likely discarded duplicate accounts.
  - 11% of network X accounts and 28% of network Y accounts are immediately inactive, suggesting at least 39% of users had duplicate accounts.
  - Network X users show a stronger commitment to maintaining their OSN presence, with a 12% decrease in active accounts compared to a 24% decrease for network Y users.

- **Edge Creation Preferences**
  - Users in both networks prefer edges to new users, followed by internal and external edges.
  - The activity gap between internal and external edges highlights strong homophily within each group.
  - Internal and external edge creation declines more rapidly than edges to new users, reflecting the natural decline in interest over time.

- **Figure 9(c)**: Number of edges of different types created per day after the merge. Edges to new users quickly become the most popular type, with a small peak for external edges.

These findings provide insights into the impact of community membership on user activity and the dynamics of merging two large online social networks.
