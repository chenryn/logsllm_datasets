### Phase 0: Preparations
1. **Initial Check:**
   - Ensure the station is in good working order on its original frequencies before conversion.
   - A Fault light on the Receiver Synthesizer Module may indicate a missing External Reference Source or an out-of-range programming attempt. Verify and set the source to internal if necessary.

2. **Tools and Equipment:**
   - Most screws in the MASTR-III T/R Frame are Torx T-15. Others are Phillips #2 and T-6, T-8, T-10, primarily found in the power supply module and power amplifier.
   - For tuning the Receiver Front End module, a service monitor with a spectrum analyzer (e.g., HP-8920 series, IFR-1600S) is recommended. Alternatively, a signal generator and a frequency-selective RF voltmeter can be used, but it is more challenging.
   - Required software: TQ-3353 Mastr-IIe, III Programming Software (M2E.BAT, M3.BAT) and TQ-0619 (MASTRUTL.BAT).
   - Soldering equipment: A quality soldering iron (e.g., Weller with an 800-degree Tip R), de-soldering tools (e.g., Sold-a-pult™, thick gauge solder wick), 0.015" solder, fine tweezers, 0.025" solder, and a brute force tip for VCO coils. 2% silver solder is recommended.

3. **Module Configuration:**
   - UHF Transmit Synthesizer, Group 6 (403 – 430 MHz)
   - UHF Receive Synthesizer, Group 3 (424.4 MHz - 451.4 MHz)
   - UHF Front End, Group 11 (410 – 430 MHz)
   - UHF Power Amplifier, Group 6 (403 – 425 MHz)
   - Note: The G11 Front end uses high-side LO injection, requiring a G3 Synthesizer for low-side injection.

### Phase 1: Operating Frequency Reprogramming
1. **Software Setup:**
   - Refer to LBI38540D.
   - Connect to the repeater using a straight-through DB-9 RS-232 cable via the Data Port on the front or the DB-9 connection on the rear of the interface board.
   - Use MASTRUTL.BAT to verify station operation and set potentiometer values, including repeat audio levels and transmitter power output.
   - Use M2E.BAT and M3.BAT to change operating parameters such as CTCSS tones, hang times, and frequencies.
   - Ensure the software is in MASTR-III mode. Programming in M2e mode may brick the System Module. Start with M3.BAT.

2. **Configuration Steps:**
   - Read and save the current configuration using F6. Create a backup and an editable file.
   - Highlight the editable file and hit F2 to edit the data to your new operating parameters.
   - Configure low-side injection from the Receiver Synthesizer Module by pressing 'CTRL E' and selecting 'O' for opposite side injection.
   - Save the data using F10, then F1, and confirm the overwrite.
   - Send the programming data to the repeater using F5 and select the edited file.
   - The Fault LEDs on the Transmitter and Receiver synthesizer modules should now be lit as the PLLs are no longer able to lock. There may be a slight flicker as the System Module attempts to reset the synthesizers.

### Phase 2: UHF Transmitter Synthesizer Module
1. **Module Modification:**
   - Refer to LBI38671N.
   - This procedure transforms the Group 6 (403 – 430 MHz) module to a Group 7 (425 – 450 MHz) module.
   - Remove the Transmitter Synthesizer Module from the T/R frame and disassemble it.
   - Desolder and set aside L1 (Red) from the underside of the board.
   - Remove the Receiver Synthesizer Module and salvage L10 (Yellow). Set it aside.
   - Perform the following parts swap:
     - Replace C5 with a 10pF Ceramic NP0 (C0G) 0805 (underside of the board).
     - Solder RX Synthesizer L10 (Yellow) in the TX Synthesizer L1 position.
     - Solder TX Synthesizer L1 (Red) in the RX Synthesizer L10 position.
   - Replace FL201 with GE Part Number 19A705458P5 or retune FL201 to pass approximately 425 – 450 MHz.
   - Reassemble the module and place it back into the T/R frame. Do not connect the Reference Input yet.
   - Adjust C10 until the module is at the lowest desired usable frequency (e.g., 435 MHz). Use a spectrum analyzer or a frequency counter that can tolerate +10dBm.
   - If tuning cannot be achieved, add a 0.5 - 3.3pF capacitor to the C4 position and try again.
   - Temporarily insert the Receive Synthesizer into the T/R frame and connect the reference output to the reference input of the Transmit Synthesizer.
   - Put the station into transmit mode and verify the Fault LED is off and the module is transmitting on frequency.
   - Use a spectrum analyzer to verify the output of the module (approximately 10 - 20 mW or 10 – 13 dBm).

### Phase 3: UHF Receiver Synthesizer Module
1. **Module Conversion:**
   - Refer to LBI38672L.
   - The Group 11 Front End (410 – 430 MHz) uses a Group 3 (450 – 470 MHz) Synthesizer, which generates high-side Local Oscillator injection.
   - Convert the receiver synthesizer to act similar to a Group 8 (380 – 400 MHz) module, providing 401.4 – 421.4 MHz.
   - The converted module will provide low-side injection for the Group 11 front end from 403.6 – 428.6 MHz, close to the original Group 6 Transmitter.
   - The output frequency of the Receiver Synthesizer Module will be Receive Frequency - 21.4 MHz (e.g., 441.3 MHz - 21.4 MHz = 419.9 MHz).
   - Low-side injection is preferred for Amateur applications as receive images will be from the Government band rather than the Commercial band and UHF TV.
   - Remove the Receiver Synthesizer Module from the T/R frame and disassemble it.
   - Retune filter FL1 to pass 403 – 430 MHz.
   - Remove C6 and replace C3 with a 27pF Ceramic NP0 (C0G) 0805 salvaged from C6.
   - Replace C5 with a 12pF Ceramic NP0 (C0G) 0805.
   - Replace C6 with an 18-22pF Ceramic NP0 (C0G) 0805 (use 22pF for 440 – 445 MHz or 18pF for 445 – 450 MHz).
   - Reattach the bottom lid and the VCO can.
   - Remove the Receiver Front End Module and IF Module from the T/R frame to access the VCO tuning adjustments.
   - Tune the VCO capacitor, C52, until the Fault LED extinguishes. Center the capacitors tuning range by adjusting C52 and noting where the Fault lights and splitting the difference.
   - Alternatively, install jumpers between U14 pin 11 (V_Tune) and +5 at U15 pin 3, and between (Enable Test) on R86 and Ground on C63. Insert the module into the T/R frame and connect a frequency counter to LO Output.
