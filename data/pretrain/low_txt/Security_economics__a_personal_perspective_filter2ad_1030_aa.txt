# Security Economics: A Personal Perspective

**Author:** Ross J. Anderson  
**Affiliation:** University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory

## Abstract
This paper traces the origins and development of security economics, a discipline that has grown significantly since its inception. Often credited to a talk I gave at ACSAC in December 2001, the story is more nuanced. After sabbatical visits to Berkeley in 2001-2002, where I collaborated with Hal Varian, we organized the first Workshop on the Economics of Information Security in June 2002. Since then, the field has expanded to include debates on open versus proprietary systems, the econometrics of online crime, and the behavioral economics of security. It has also begun to influence policy, with studies on cybercrime and infrastructure vulnerability being adopted in the EU, and security economics PhDs taking influential roles in the White House and other key positions.

## 1. Early Days
The organizers of ACSAC have asked me to discuss the history of security economics. This subject is often considered to have been initiated by my talk at ACSAC in December 2001, titled "Why Information Security is Hard – An Economic Perspective" [2]. However, this paper was actually based on new material from my book "Security Engineering," which was published in the summer of 2001 [3], and had already been presented as an invited talk at SOSP in October of that year. Other contributors were also instrumental in establishing the field. To provide a comprehensive account, I have reviewed old emails to refresh my memory.

I first met Hal Varian, then an economics professor at the University of Michigan, through email while we served on a program committee together. He later moved to Berkeley, and I arranged to meet him for dinner during the IEEE Security and Privacy event in Oakland in May 2000. Our conversation was so engaging that we continued discussing in his car for about an hour, missing most of the conference reception.

Hal had been examining various online payment systems, including PayPal, and recognized the importance of liability assignment in the growth of credit cards. He had read my 1993 paper "Why Cryptosystems Fail," which analyzed ATM fraud and described liability shifts in debit card payments [4]. I had been puzzled by why U.S. banks, despite having more liability for card fraud, spent less on security than British banks. In a 1994 paper, "Liability and Computer Security" [5], I explored this issue. Hal suggested it was a classic case of moral hazard, where UK banks, protected by inappropriate liability laws, became complacent, leading to increased fraud. He recommended his book "Information Rules," co-authored with Carl Shapiro [34], and sent me a draft of a New York Times column discussing the need for greater ISP liability [39].

Hal's book profoundly influenced my thinking. As I completed "Security Engineering," I found that economic incentives provided a unifying narrative for the different case studies and system engineering principles. On September 9, 2001, I emailed Hal, noting that I was increasingly aware of security failures due to a lack of understanding of network economics. I asked him to review the security-economics arguments in the e-commerce and assurance chapters, which became sections 19.6, 19.7, and 23.2. His feedback was invaluable in refining these sections.

Having joined the Cambridge faculty in 1995, I was due for a sabbatical in 2001-2002. Following our productive exchange, I discussed spending part of my sabbatical at Berkeley, which Hal enthusiastically supported. He also provided me with his undergraduate microeconomics textbook.

While Hal was a key inspiration, others, such as Andrew Odlyzko, also contributed. Odlyzko observed that the poor user-friendliness of Microsoft software and the Internet was due to their focus on developers as much as users [31], an insight that extended naturally to security after reading Hal's book.

My book was finally printed in January 2001. I extracted an agreement from the publisher, Wiley, to publish the new material on security economics as a paper, which became "Why Information Security is Hard – An Economic Perspective." This paper was presented at ACSAC in December 2001 and earlier at SOSP in Banff, Alberta, in October 2001. The idea that platforms like Windows are insecure because Microsoft prioritized developers over end-users to win platform races resonated with the audience.

## 2. From 9/11 to the First WEIS
By the time I gave the SOSP talk in Banff, the 9/11 attacks had occurred, making security a pressing concern for many. My thoughts on the attacks were still evolving, but I included a few paragraphs in the ACSAC version of the paper. Like many, I was concerned about the potential for overreaction, but saw the invasion of Afghanistan as inevitable. I drew an analogy with the early 19th-century piracy, noting the moral dilemmas faced by liberals.

I also predicted that economic arguments would apply to physical as well as digital security. As war rhetoric intensified, I believed the best contribution would be to build a systematic approach. Our mission should be to understand risk, systems, crime, and conflict; to develop models; to collect data; and to provide solid policy advice when the world returned to rationality.

From Banff, I flew to Berkeley and spent October-November 2001 there on sabbatical. Hal and I discussed security with other economists, such as Carl Shapiro and Suzanne Scotchmer, and planned the first Workshop on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS). I also familiarized myself with the work of George Akerlof, a Nobel laureate who pioneered research on asymmetric information, and Jack Hirshleifer, the founder of conflict theory.

Next, I spent two weeks in Singapore, teaching a cryptography course and reading on environmental economics. I began to think about lock-in and scaremongering, which were prominent in both environmental and security debates. After Christmas, I spent January-February 2002 at MIT, working on technical topics such as API security and peer-to-peer systems, leading to collaborative projects between Cambridge and MIT.

Returning to Berkeley in May-June 2002, we realized that security economics was gaining traction. The theoretical computer science community at Berkeley was working on algorithmic mechanism design, and there was overlap with conferences like ACM EC and Gamesec.

The highlight of the trip was WEIS. While Hal and I were not the only ones discussing security and economics, WEIS brought the threads together, transforming scattered observations into a coherent discipline.

In addition to my early papers on ATM security, Hal's 1996 paper "Economic Aspects of Personal Privacy" [38] and a 1996 Comm ACM paper by Laudon [26] were influential. Carl Landwehr pointed us to a 1991 NRC report on security market failure [28].

New work at the first WEIS included Alessandro Acquisti introducing behavioral economics, showing that Pareto-optimal outcomes could be hindered by information asymmetry and user myopia. Jean Camp proposed a market in vulnerabilities, which quickly became a reality. Larry Gordon, Marty Loeb, and Bill Lucyshyn applied trade association literature to analyze the need for information sharing on security vulnerabilities. Barb Fox discussed the economics of standards, foreshadowing future developments.

## 3. Early Growth and 'TC'
Barb's talk at WEIS hinted at the next phase in security economics, particularly the role of standards and the broader implications for the field.
