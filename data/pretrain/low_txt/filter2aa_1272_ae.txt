### Mitigation

This section outlines key mitigating measures for email spoofing, a complex problem that requires multi-party collaboration to address effectively.

#### More Accurate Standards
Email providers often fail to offer secure and reliable services due to ambiguous definitions in email protocols. To eliminate inconsistencies, more precise protocol descriptions are essential. For example, the DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) standard should specify when a DKIM signature should be added to forwarded emails. It is reasonable for forwarders to add DKIM signatures to enhance email credibility, but they should not do so for emails that have not passed DKIM verification.

#### User Interface (UI) Notifications
The way an email is rendered in the user interface significantly affects users' perception of its authenticity. Most webmails and email clients in our experiments only display the "From" header without additional authentication details, making it difficult for ordinary users to judge the email's legitimacy. Some visual attacks, such as A12 and A13, cannot be defended at the protocol level. An effective defense is to provide user-friendly UI notifications that alert users about potential spoofing emails. Hu et al. [20] demonstrated that good visual security notifications positively impact the mitigation of phishing email threats in real-world scenarios. As shown in Figure 4, the spoofing email in Section 5 can pass all three email protocol verifications, yet users cannot distinguish it from normal emails without a UI notification.

Figure 16 illustrates how users can intuitively recognize malicious behaviors based on UI notifications. Coremail, a prominent email service provider in China, has adopted our suggestions and implemented UI notifications in its webmail and email client. Additionally, we have released a Chrome extension called "NoSpoofing" for Gmail to provide these notifications.

#### Evaluation Tools
We have publicly released a testing tool on GitHub to help email administrators evaluate and enhance their security. After configuring the target email system information, the tool interacts with the system and assesses its vulnerability to various attacks.

### Disclosure and Response

Vulnerabilities identified in this work have been reported to all 30 relevant email vendors. Our contact results are summarized below:

- **Alibaba Cloud**: They expressed interest in the attacks and discussed the specifications with us. They noted that RFC 6376 suggests adding a DKIM signature during email forwarding to increase credibility. They now recognize the risk of adding unverified DKIM signatures and promise to evaluate and fix these issues. They also suggested contacting the authors of related RFCs to reach a consensus on a fix.
- **Gmail**: They acknowledged our report and will address the issues in subsequent updates. They contacted us to discuss the underlying reasons for these security issues.
- **iCloud**: We discussed the attack details and potential consequences. Apple iCloud Email has already fixed the related security issues with our cooperation.
- **Sina**: They evaluated the issue as a high-risk vulnerability and internally assessed protective measures. They provided a reward of approximately $90.
- **Yandex**: They accepted our report and confirmed the vulnerability, providing a bonus of $200.
- **Yahoo**: They confirmed the vulnerability but claimed it was not an immediate risk.
- **Coremail**: They acknowledged our report, thanked us for reporting the UI attack issue, and started implementing UI notifications to protect users against email spoofing.
- **QQ Mail and 163.com**: They appreciated our work and informed us that they would fix the security issues using anti-spam strategies.
- **Outlook and Mail.ru**: They stated that they strictly follow RFC standards and categorized these problems as phishing, promising to pay more attention to such attacks.
- **Others**: We have contacted other relevant email vendors and await their feedback.

### Related Work

Previous studies have highlighted the threats of phishing email attacks [8,12], including the impact of spear phishing on user behavior [32]. Our work focuses on novel forms of spoofing attacks and their influence on the entire authentication process. Poddebniak et al. [37] discussed how practical spoofing attacks can break OpenPGP and S/MIME email signature verification and proposed new protocols like BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) [41] and ARC (Authenticated Received Chain) [3] to enhance detection. However, BIMI is built on DMARC and is not fully standardized, and ARC, though standardized in 2019, is only deployed by a few vendors (Gmail, Office 365, Zoho). Our work finds that both Office 365 and Zoho have flaws in their ARC implementation, leading to security issues.

Hu et al. [20] analyzed how email vendors detect and handle spoofing emails through an end-to-end experiment. While most of the vulnerabilities they mentioned have been fixed, they did not discuss bypassing security protocol detection. Our work focuses on new attacks that can bypass security protocols or user-interface protections, constructing highly realistic spoofing emails that can evade all email security protocols and UI protections.

Prior literature has proposed many techniques to defend against traditional phishing attacks, such as SMTP extensions (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC) designed to protect email authenticity. Foster et al. [14] measured the implementation and deployment of these protocols, noting that despite years of development, their acceptance rate remains low, jeopardizing the security of the email ecosystem [19].

Many works discuss phishing detection methods based on features extracted from email content and headers [7,13,28], often relying on machine learning. Ho et al. [18] highlighted the positive effects of a good security metric against phishing. Other works [21,36] indicate that current email services lack UI notifications similar to HTTPS [33], and contemporary visual security indicators are insufficient for full phishing protection [20,29]. For email spoofing, our research provides a UI notification scheme and evaluation tools for email administrators, aiming to boost protective measures.

### Conclusion

This paper explores the vulnerabilities in the chain-based authentication structure of the email ecosystem. A failure in any part of this chain can compromise the entire authentication process. We presented a series of new attacks that bypass SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and UI protections through a systematic analysis of the email delivery process. A large-scale analysis of 30 popular email services and 23 email clients showed that all are vulnerable to these new attacks, including well-known services like Gmail and Outlook. Many email services have not implemented adequate protective measures.

Based on our findings, we analyzed the root causes of these attacks and reported the issues to corresponding email service providers. We proposed key mitigating measures for email protocol designers and providers to defend against email spoofing. Our work aims to help the email industry more efficiently protect users and improve the overall security of the email ecosystem.
