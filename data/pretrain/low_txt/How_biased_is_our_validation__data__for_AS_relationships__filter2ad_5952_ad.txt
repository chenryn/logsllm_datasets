### Research Space and Future Directions

Given the findings from §4.2, we advocate for a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to future research efforts in this domain. Specifically, we recommend that:

1. **Diverse Goals**: Future research should be evaluated against a broader and more diverse set of goals to ensure a more holistic understanding of the subject matter.
2. **Handling Spurious Labels**: There should be more careful and explicit handling of spurious labels, sibling relationships, and complex relationships during validation efforts. This will help in improving the robustness and reliability of the results.

### Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to the anonymous reviewers and our shepherd, Cecilia Testart, for their valuable feedback and comments. We also extend our thanks to Yuchen Jin and Zitong Jin for providing us with access to the validation data for ProbLink and Toposcope.

### Correlation Analysis

#### Performance Metrics and Validation Coverage

Some of the link classes for which the inference algorithms perform poorly have higher validation coverage. In this section, we show that there is no significant correlation between these two metrics. We conducted the following experiment:

- **Experiment Setup**: We uniformly sampled a subset of relationships and tracked their evaluation performance using the metrics discussed in §6. The subset size was varied between 50% and 99% of the original set size, with increments of 1%. To ensure stochastic robustness, this process was repeated 100 times for each sample size.
- **Analysis Focus**: While we performed this analysis for all link classes mentioned in §5, we discuss the results for the 𝑇 1 − 𝑇 𝑅 class, which produced low-performance results while containing more than 600 peering relationships.
- **Results Visualization**: Figures 4, 5, and 6 show the sample size on the x-axis against the precision (𝑃𝑃𝑉𝑃), recall (𝑇 𝑃𝑅𝑃), and MCC on the y-axis. Each figure marks individual performance measurements for each sampled set with a cross and shows the interquartile-range (IQR) and median across all 100 sampled sets.
- **Observations**: Although the variance increases with decreasing sample size, we do not observe a clear increasing or decreasing trend for the performance metrics. Similar conclusions can be drawn for other link classes (not shown).

### Alternative Metrics Plots

Figures 7, 8, and 9 show alternate variants of Figure 3 for the customer cone size (CCS), CCS when ignoring links incident to route collector peers (i.e., vantage point ASes), and the node degree.

### Potential Features for Identifying Hard Links

The following per-link metrics might help identify additional groups of 'hard links':

1. Visibility over time
2. Number of prefixes redistributed via the link
3. Number of addresses covered by those prefixes
4. Number of prefixes originated through the link
5. Number of addresses covered by those prefixes
6. Number of ASes that can observe (i.e., occur left from) the link
7. Number of ASes that might receive traffic via (i.e., occur right from) the link
