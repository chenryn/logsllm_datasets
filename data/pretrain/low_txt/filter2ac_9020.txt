### Title: Stealing With Style: Using CSS to Exploit ProtonMail & Friends

Privacy-focused webmail providers like ProtonMail, Tutanota, and Skiff offer a convenient way to secure communications. Even non-technical users can send end-to-end encrypted emails, which is especially valuable for high-risk individuals such as journalists, whistleblowers, and political activists, as well as privacy-conscious internet users. However, end-to-end encryption becomes ineffective if the client itself has vulnerabilities.

In this talk, we will delve into critical vulnerabilities we discovered in ProtonMail, Tutanota, and Skiff. These vulnerabilities could have been exploited to steal emails, impersonate victims, and, in one case, even execute code remotely. We will present the technical details of these vulnerabilities through three case studies, demonstrating how we identified and exploited serious flaws using unconventional methods. Join us on an adventure that explores mXSS (mutated cross-site scripting), parser differentials, and the role of modern CSS in facilitating exploitation.
