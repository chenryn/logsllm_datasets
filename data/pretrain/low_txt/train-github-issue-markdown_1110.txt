Docker 1.12 is scheduled for release in one week and will include a new feature: the options `--dns` and `--net=host` will no longer be mutually exclusive (refer to [moby/moby#22408](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/22408) for more details).

To take advantage of this functionality, we should update kubelet to support it. Currently, when `hostNetwork: true` is set, all DNS settings are ignored. We need to modify kubelet to ensure that DNS settings are respected even when `hostNetwork: true` is enabled.
