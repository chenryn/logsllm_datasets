### EDB Postgres Replication Server Userâ€™s Guide

#### 10.2.1 Upgrading with the Graphical User Interface Installer

To upgrade to xDB Replication Server 6.2 using the graphical user interface installer, follow these steps:

1. **Replicate Pending Transactions:**
   - Ensure that all pending transactions on the publication tables are replicated before starting the upgrade process.

2. **Stop xDB Replication Server 6.1.x:**
   - After all pending transactions have been replicated to their target databases, stop the xDB Replication Server 6.1.x publication and subscription servers. Refer to sections 5.2.1 and 5.3.1 for detailed instructions.

3. **Install xDB Replication Server 6.2:**
   - Install xDB Replication Server 6.2. Follow the installation instructions in Chapter 3, noting the differences described in the following steps.

4. **Select Components:**
   - After accepting the license agreement in Step 11 of Section 3.1, the "Select Components" screen will appear with entries grayed out. The old xDB Replication Server components will be replaced by the new ones in the same directory location. Click "Next."

7. **Complete Installation:**
   - The remaining screens will confirm the completion of the installation process and allow you to exit from Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus.

8. **Post-Installation Verification:**
   - After installation, the publication server of the new xDB Replication Server product should be running, connected to the controller database used by xDB Replication Server 6.1. The subscription server may or may not be running at this point, which is expected.

9. **Configure Configuration Files:**
   - In the `XDB_HOME/etc` directory, new configuration files for xDB Replication Server version 6.2 are created: `xdb_pubserver.conf.new` and `xdb_subserver.conf.new`. These files contain any new configuration options added for xDB Replication Server 6.2.
   - The old configuration files used by xDB Replication Server version 6.1.x remain unchanged as `xdb_pubserver.conf` and `xdb_subserver.conf`.
   - Merge the old and new configuration files so that the resulting, active configuration files (`xdb_pubserver.conf` and `xdb_subserver.conf`) contain any new xDB Replication Server 6.2 configuration options as well as any non-default settings you wish to continue using.
   - In the `XDB_HOME/etc/sysconfig` directory, ensure that the xDB Startup Configuration file `xdbReplicationServer-62.config` contains the parameter settings you wish to use with xDB Replication Server 6.2. Refer to Section 2.3.1.4 for more information.

10. **Restart Servers:**
    - Restart the publication and subscription servers. See sections 5.2.1 and 5.3.1 for detailed instructions.

11. **Verify Log Files:**
    - Check the publication and subscription server log files to verify that no errors have occurred. Refer to Section 10.3.2.4 for more information.

12. **Adjust Port Numbers:**
    - If necessary, adjust the publication and subscription server port numbers. The default port numbers for xDB Replication Server 6.2 are 9051 and 9052, respectively. If the xDB Replication Server 6.1.x replication systems used different port numbers, perform the modifications as described in Section 10.2.3.
    - If no adjustment is needed, register the publication and subscription servers with the xDB Replication Console as described in sections 5.2.1 and 5.3.1. The existing replication systems should appear in the replication tree of the xDB Replication Console.

13. **Final Steps:**
    - You are now ready to use xDB Replication Server 6.2 to create new replication systems and manage existing ones.

#### 10.2.2 Upgrading with the xDB Replication Server RPM Package

If you are using xDB Replication Server 6.1.x installed via the xDB RPM package, follow these steps to upgrade to xDB Replication Server 6.2:

**Note:** Ensure that the repository configuration file `edb.repo` for xDB Replication Server 6.2 is set up in the `/etc/yum.repos.d` directory. Refer to Section 3.3 for more information.

1. **Replicate Pending Transactions:**
   - Ensure that all pending transactions on the publication tables are replicated before starting the upgrade process.

2. **Stop xDB Replication Server 6.1.x:**
   - After all pending transactions have been replicated to their target databases, stop the xDB Replication Server 6.1.x publication and subscription servers. Refer to sections 5.2.1 and 5.3.1 for detailed instructions.

3. **Save Configuration Files:**
   - Save a copy of the following configuration files:
     - `/etc/edb-repl.conf`
     - `/usr/ppas-xdb-6.1/etc/xdb_pubserver.conf`
     - `/usr/ppas-xdb-6.1/etc/xdb_subserver.conf`
     - `/usr/ppas-xdb-6.1/etc/sysconfig/xdbReplicationServer-61.config`
   - Copies of these files are typically saved by the upgrade process if they had been modified since their original installation. However, it is safest to save copies in case the upgrade process fails to do so. Use the saved files as your xDB Replication Server 6.1.x configuration files for the updates described in Step 7.

4. **Oracle JDBC Driver:**
   - If any Oracle publication or subscription databases are used in existing single-master replication systems, ensure that a copy of the Oracle JDBC driver (version ojdbc5 or later) is accessible by the publication and subscription servers where xDB Replication Server 6.2 will be installed. Refer to Section 5.1.3.1 for more information.
   - **Option 1:** Copy the Oracle JDBC driver to the `jre/lib/ext` subdirectory of your Java runtime environment.
   - **Option 2:** Copy the Oracle JDBC driver to the `lib/jdbc` subdirectory of the xDB Replication Server installation directory.
   - It is recommended to perform Option 1. If you choose Option 2, copy the Oracle JDBC driver to the `/usr/ppas-xdb-6.2/lib/jdbc` directory after installing xDB Replication Server 6.2.

5. **Ensure Controller Database is Running:**
   - Ensure that the controller database is up and running. The other publication and subscription databases of existing SMR and MMR systems do not need to be up and running.

6. **Upgrade Using YUM:**
   - As the root account, invoke the `yum update` command to begin the upgrade from xDB Replication Server 6.1.x to xDB Replication Server 6.2:
     ```sh
     yum update ppas-xdb*
     ```
   - Include the asterisk character (*) following `ppas-xdb` to update all xDB Replication Server components.

   **Example:**
   ```sh
   [root@localhost ~]# yum update ppas-xdb*

   ```

   - At this point, the publication and subscription servers for xDB Replication Server 6.2 are not running.

   - The directories now contain the following:
     - xDB Replication Server 6.2 is installed in the directory `/usr/ppas-xdb-6.2`.
     - xDB Replication Server 6.1.x remains in the directory `/usr/ppas-xdb-6.1`, but with the files removed from subdirectories such as `bin` and `lib`.
     - In the `etc` subdirectory, there may be the configuration files renamed as `xdb_pubserver.conf.rpmsave` and `xdb_subserver.conf.rpmsave`.
     - In the `etc/sysconfig` subdirectory, there may be the configuration file renamed as `xdbReplicationServer-61.config.rpmsave`.
     - In the `/etc` directory, there may be one or two xDB Replication Configuration files named `edb-repl.conf` and possibly `edb-repl.conf.rpmsave`. The file `edb-repl.conf` should contain the connection and authentication information for the controller database used by the xDB 6.1.x publication server. The file `edb-repl.conf.rpmsave` contains only the new administrator user parameters `admin_user` and `admin_password`.

7. **Complete Configuration File Setup:**
   - In the `/usr/ppas-xdb-6.2/etc` directory, a new set of configuration files for xDB Replication Server version 6.2 are created: `xdb_pubserver.conf` and `xdb_subserver.conf`. These files contain any new configuration options added for xDB Replication Server 6.2.
   - The old configuration files used by xDB Replication Server version 6.1.x might be found in the `/usr/ppas-xdb-6.1/etc` directory renamed as `xdb_pubserver.conf.rpmsave` and `xdb_subserver.conf.rpmsave`.
   - Merge the old and new configuration files so that the resulting, active configuration files (`xdb_pubserver.conf` and `xdb_subserver.conf`) contain any new xDB Replication Server 6.2 configuration options as well as any non-default settings you wish to continue using.
   - In the `/usr/ppas-xdb-6.2/etc/sysconfig` directory, ensure that the xDB Startup Configuration file `xdbReplicationServer-62.config` contains the parameter settings you wish to use with xDB Replication Server 6.2. Refer to Section 2.3.1.4 for more information.

8. **Restart Servers:**
   - Restart the publication and subscription servers. See sections 5.2.1 and 5.3.1 for detailed instructions.

9. **Verify Log Files:**
   - Check the publication and subscription server log files to verify that no errors have occurred. Refer to Section 10.3.2.4 for more information.

10. **Adjust Port Numbers:**
    - If necessary, adjust the publication and subscription server port numbers. The default port numbers for xDB Replication Server 6.2 are 9051 and 9052, respectively. If the xDB Replication Server 6.1.x replication systems used different port numbers, perform the modifications as described in Section 10.2.3.
    - If no adjustment is needed, register the publication and subscription servers with the xDB Replication Console as described in sections 5.2.1 and 5.3.1. The existing replication systems should appear in the replication tree of the xDB Replication Console.

11. **Final Steps:**
    - You are now ready to use xDB Replication Server 6.2 to create new replication systems and manage existing ones.

#### 10.2.3 Updating the Publication and Subscription Server Ports

The newly installed publication and subscription servers of xDB Replication Server 6.2 are configured to use the default port numbers 9051 and 9052, respectively. These port numbers are set in the xDB Startup Configuration file as described in Section 2.3.1.4.

If your xDB Replication Server 6.1.x replication systems were running under port numbers other than 9051 and 9052, some of your settings in xDB Replication Server 6.2 must be adjusted to continue to use these existing replication systems.

**Note:** The following changes regarding port 9052 and the subscription server are only needed if you are running a single-master replication system. If you are using only a multi-master replication system, then only the changes involving port 9051 and the publication server are needed.

There are two methods to correct this:

1. **Continue Using Old Port Numbers:**
   - Stop the publication and subscription servers.
   - Change the settings of the `PUBPORT` and `SUBPORT` parameters in the xDB Startup Configuration file from 9051 and 9052 to the old port numbers used by xDB Replication Server 6.1.x.
   - Restart the publication and subscription servers.
   - Register the publication and subscription servers with the old xDB Replication Server 6.1.x port numbers along with the admin user and password as described in sections 5.2.1 and 5.3.1.

2. **Use Default Port Numbers:**
   - Replace the old port numbers with the default port numbers 9051 and 9052.
   - Register the publication and subscription servers with port numbers 9051 and 9052 along with the admin user and password.

By following these steps, you can successfully upgrade to xDB Replication Server 6.2 and ensure that your replication systems continue to function correctly.
