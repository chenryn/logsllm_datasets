### IPv6: No Longer Optional
**John Curran, ARIN President & CEO**

#### A Brief History of the Internet Protocol

- **Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)**
  - Developed for the original Internet (ARPANET) in spring 1978.
  - Deployed globally as the Internet grew.
  - Provides a total of 4 billion IP addresses.
  - Widely used by ISPs and hosting companies to connect customers to the Internet.
  - Allocated based on documented need.

- **Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)**
  - Design initiated in 1993 when IETF forecasts predicted IPv4 depletion between 2010 and 2017.
  - Completed, tested, and available for production since 1999.
  - Offers a total of 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 IP addresses.
  - Managed and used similarly to IPv4.

#### Comparison of IPv4 and IPv6

| Feature             | IPv4                     | IPv6                                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Deployment          | 1981                     | 1999                                    |
| Address Size        | 32-bit number            | 128-bit number                          |
| Address Format      | Dotted Decimal Notation: 192.0.2.76 | Hexadecimal Notation: 2001:0DB8:0234:AB00:0123:4567:8901:ABCD |
| Number of Addresses | 2^32 = 4,294,967,296     | 2^128 = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 |
| Examples of Prefix Notation | 192.0.2.0/24, 10/8 (a “/8” block = 1/256th of total IPv4 address space = 2^24 = 16,777,216 addresses) | 2001:0DB8:0234::/48, 2600:0000::/12 |

#### IPv4 Address Space Utilization
*As of June 2, 2010*

- RIRs have been allocated ten /8s blocks, leaving sixteen /8s unallocated (16/256 = 6.25%).
- Demand for IPv4 continues to grow from organizations around the world.
- The RIRs require between 8 and 12 /8s each year worldwide.

#### IPv4 Depletion Situation Report
- There are 16 /8s remaining in the available pool as of June 2, 2010.
- Demand for IPv4 continues to grow globally.

#### The Bottom Line
- We are running out of IPv4 address space.
- IPv6 must be adopted for continued Internet growth.
- IPv6 is not backward compatible with IPv4.
- We must maintain both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously for many years.
- IPv6 deployment has begun.

#### IPv6 Deployment
- RIRs have been allocating IPv6 address space since 1999.
- Thousands of organizations have received an IPv6 allocation to date.
- ARIN has IPv6 distribution policies for service providers, community networks, and end-user organizations.
- Today, the Internet is predominantly based on IPv4, but dual-stack approaches (running both IPv4 and IPv6 on a single device) are necessary for the foreseeable future.

#### Action Plans
- **Broadband Access Providers**: Offer full access to both IPv4 and IPv6 websites. This will require significant engineering projects and the use of transition services.
- **Internet Service Providers**: Plan to connect businesses via IPv6-only and IPv4/IPv6, in addition to IPv4-only. Communicate with peers and vendors about IPv6 timelines.
- **Internet Content Providers**: Ensure content is reachable via IPv6. Plan to serve content via IPv6 as soon as possible.
- **Enterprise Customers**: Ensure mail, web, and application servers are reachable via IPv6. Open a dialogue with your ISP about IPv6 services.
- **Equipment Vendors**: Introduce IPv6 support into your product cycle as soon as possible.
- **Government Organizations**: Adopt IPv6 address space, connectivity, software, hardware, and IT staff training.

#### Awareness and Incentives
- Coordinate with industry.
- Adopt regulatory and economic incentives.
- Support and promote awareness and educational activities.
- Require IPv6-compatibility in procurement procedures.
- Officially adopt IPv6.
