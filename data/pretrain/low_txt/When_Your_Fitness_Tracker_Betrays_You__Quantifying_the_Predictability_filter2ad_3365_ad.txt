**Biometric Information Quality and Security**

It is evident that lower-end devices are less effective sources of biometric information, primarily due to their less precise sensors. These sensors typically have lower sampling rates and resolutions, which significantly impact the accuracy of acceleration features (due to low touchscreen sampling rates) and the area covered (due to low resolution). Conversely, high-quality sensors can enhance the security of authentication systems by providing more accurate and reliable data.

**Mouse Movements Analysis**

Figure 5d illustrates the average unpredictability results for various mouse movement features. Curvature-based features, in particular, exhibit high predictability and lack significant distinctiveness, making them unsuitable for security-critical scenarios. However, click duration shows a high mean and standard deviation. This is attributed to the trackpad API returning coarse-grained click information, which is less sensitive than that provided by a traditional mouse. If the source and target were switched, this feature would be highly predictable, as the set of valid target values would be small. This example underscores the importance of using more accurate, high-resolution sensors to counteract attacks from lower-quality data sources.

**Population Size Analysis**

Collecting a large number of biometric samples to train cross-context mappings is a substantial effort. While publicly available datasets (see Section 3) can be used, they may not always be applicable to the victim's specific context, especially if the device is unusual. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the required population size to achieve acceptable results. Figure 6 illustrates the relationship between the number of users in the population and the average score of the resulting cross-context mapping. All biometrics show an initial sharp decline in scores, with diminishing returns beyond a population size of 10. These results indicate that most of the predictive power of cross-context mappings can be achieved with a relatively small population. Additionally, Figure 6 suggests that our study sample size of 30 participants is sufficient to demonstrate differences between individual features, contexts, and biometrics.

**Conclusion**

In this paper, we present an analytical framework to measure the unpredictability of biometric features across different contexts. We define an unpredictability score, which can be calculated for both individual features and complete biometrics. This score provides detailed information about the resilience of biometric systems against cross-context attacks and can be used to: (i) compare biometric systems, (ii) identify vulnerable target contexts, and (iii) select and engineer features. The framework involves computing a mapping between a source and target context, derived from population data.

Our results show that the five biometrics evaluated in this paper exhibit varying degrees of resilience to cross-context attacks. Specifically, ECG and gait are up to twice as unpredictable across contexts compared to touch dynamics, mouse, and eye movements. Our analysis highlights particularly predictable features and suggests that some can be omitted from the feature set to enhance security. Furthermore, improving the quality of biometric sensors enhances the resilience of authentication systems. The fact that some contexts are more useful than others for prediction indicates that the sources of biometric information potentially available to an attacker must be an integral part of any biometric threat model.

**Appendix A: Complete Feature Analysis**

In Tables 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, we report the results of the computation of unpredictability scores (Equation 5) for individual features for ECG, gait, touch dynamics, mouse movements, and eye movements, respectively. The tables also list the complete set of features used in the paper and their RMI (with the exception of gait, which only shows the results for the 25 most relevant features for brevity). We used the methodology described in Section 5.3 and the target contexts explained in Section 6.1.

**Appendix B: Optimization Problem**

Let \( D_{f_\theta} = \{ \xi \in \mathbb{R} \mid f_\theta(X_u)(\xi) - F_{X^{(s)}}(\xi) \neq 0 \} \) be the set in which the integrand of Equation 3 is non-zero. This set generally depends on the specific choice of the mapping function \( f_\theta \). Let \( lb(t) \) be the minimum observed value for the target feature and \( ub(t) \) be the maximum. We define a region around the observed target feature space as:

\[ D = \{ \xi \in \mathbb{R} \mid lb(t) - q \Delta(t) \leq \xi \leq ub(t) + q \Delta(t) \} \]

where \( \Delta(t) = ub(t) - lb(t) \) and \( q > 0 \) is a relaxing factor. Given a parametrized family of mapping functions \( \{ f_\theta \}_{\theta \in \Theta} \), we then define \( \Theta \) as:

\[ \Theta = \{ \theta \in \mathbb{R}^m \mid D_{f_\theta} \subseteq D \} \]

This constrains the range of the transformed source feature to be similar to the range of the target feature. Additionally, for every \( \xi \in \mathbb{R} \), we have:

\[ 0 \leq (F_{f_\theta(X_u)}(\xi) - F_{X^{(s)}}(\xi))^2 \leq 1 \]

Thus, for every \( \theta \in \Theta \):

\[ 0 \leq \int_D (F_{f_\theta(X_u)}(\xi) - F_{X^{(s)}}(\xi))^2 d\xi \leq m(D) \]

By setting \( w = \frac{1}{m(D)} \), the distance function defined in Equation 3 is normalized in \([0, 1]\).

Finally, note that the set of constraints 7 is linear if \( f_\theta \) is linear with respect to the parameter vector \( \theta \) (e.g., \( f_\theta \) is a generic polynomial function) and can be solved exactly and efficiently by an optimization algorithm. In this case, \( f_\theta(x) = \theta^T \cdot h(x) \) for a specific vector-valued function \( h \). Hence, constraint 7 is equivalent to checking for each feature value \( x \) observed in the users' population:

\[ lb(t) - q \Delta(t) \leq \theta^T \cdot h(x) \leq ub(t) + q \Delta(t) \]

which is linear in the parameter vector \( \theta \).

**Appendix C: Degree Analysis**

Table 10 lists biometric unpredictability scores for cross-context mappings of degrees from 1 to 4, using source and target context pairs discussed in Section 6.1. Figure 7 shows how unpredictability scores are affected by different polynomials \( f_\theta \) in the case of ECG biometrics. Figure 7 and Table 10 indicate that the relative ranking in terms of average unpredictability scores for the biometrics is not affected by the degree of \( f_\theta \). For the 41 different source context pairs discussed, a linear \( f_\theta \) provides an estimation of the unpredictability score similar to that of polynomials \( f_\theta \).

The score of mouse movement biometrics is the only one that slightly decreases as the degree of \( f_\theta \) increases.
