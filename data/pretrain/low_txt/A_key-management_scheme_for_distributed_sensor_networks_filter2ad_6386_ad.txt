### D. Complexity Analysis

The storage and communication overheads are detailed in Table V. In this table, \( L \) represents the length of the session key, \( N \) denotes the length of the noise in the vault, and \( s \) is the polynomial degree. 

In the Polynomial Secret Key Agreement (PSKA) scheme, sensors must send, receive, and store both the polynomial coefficients and the vault (noise numbers). In contrast, the proposed ECG-IJS scheme requires sensors to store only the polynomial coefficients, and only a subset of these coefficients needs to be transmitted to the receiver. This significantly reduces the storage and communication overheads compared to the PSKA [8] algorithm, as shown in Table V.

Table VI provides a computation analysis focusing on hash operations, asymmetric and symmetric algorithms, polynomial operations, and vault generation for both the proposed ECG-IJS scheme and the PSKA [34] algorithm. In Table VI, \( m \) represents the number of orthonormal pseudorandom vectors, and \( n \) denotes the number of features.

The PSKA protocol includes one hash operation, one asymmetric operation, and one symmetric operation to compute the message digest code with \( m + n \) polynomial operations, one public-key encryption to encrypt the sending message, and \( m + n \) vault generations to ensure that the noises differ from the polynomial coefficients. In the proposed ECG-IJS scheme, the \( m + n \) computations for vault generation are unnecessary because it does not use noises to hide the session key. From Tables V and VI, it is evident that the ECG-IJS scheme has lower overheads in terms of storage, communication, and computation compared to the existing PSKA scheme.

### Major Contributions

Our primary contribution in this paper is the innovative application and adaptation of the IJS algorithm to data authentication in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). We summarize our major contributions as follows:
1. We developed a new biometric-based approach for authenticating message communications in WBANs using a lightweight method. This approach can be implemented in resource-constrained tiny body sensors.
2. We designed a novel key-agreement scheme that allows the sender and receiver to share the same key with minimal communication overhead.
3. Compared to an existing PSKA [8] authentication scheme using fuzzy vaults, our approach has lower computational and communication overheads and higher energy efficiency, which are crucial for resource-limited body sensors. The experimental results also demonstrate that our approach achieves high security performance.

### E. Security Analysis

In this section, we conduct a security analysis of the proposed ECG-IJS approach, focusing on three aspects: data confidentiality, data authenticity and integrity, and overall security.

1. **Data Confidentiality:**
   Data confidentiality ensures that information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals. In the ECG-IJS scheme, the vector \( R \), which contains the coefficients of the monic polynomial, is public. However, without a similar feature set, an attacker cannot unlock the feature to regenerate the key. Thus, data confidentiality is maintained.

2. **Data Authenticity and Integrity:**
   Ensuring data authenticity and integrity involves verifying that the data received is identical to the data sent and that it has not been modified by attackers. In the ECG-IJS scheme, a key agreement using a hash function (e.g., SHA-1, SHA-2) ensures data authenticity and integrity. If the data is not sent from the sensor on the same person or if the data is modified, the key recovery will fail, leading to the failure of the authentication.

3. **Security Analysis:**
   The primary threats to Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs) include adversaries who can eavesdrop on all traffic within the network, inject messages, replay old messages, and spoof node identities. The wireless medium is inherently untrusted due to its broadcast nature. However, adversaries cannot measure ECG signals and therefore do not directly know the keys being used. The ECG-IJS scheme is designed to maintain data confidentiality and authenticity, making other attacks such as Wormhole, sinkhole, and Sybil attacks less relevant.

### V. Conclusion

Secure communications in WBSNs are essential for preserving a person's health privacy and safety. In some applications, security breaches could even threaten lives. In this paper, we present an improved Juels and Sudan (IJS) scheme for key agreement, which preserves both privacy and authenticity in an energy-efficient manner. Our major contributions include:
1. The proposed ECG-IJS scheme can share a key in an energy-efficient manner for WBSNs.
2. A novel hash-based authentication approach using measured ECG signals at both the sender's and receiver's sites.
3. A framework for the security analysis of WBSNs.

In our proposed approach, ECG signals are used as biometrics to generate keys for data encryption and hash-based message authentication. Our studies show that the proposed scheme is a lightweight and energy-efficient security solution for WBSNs, outperforming existing approaches. The performance of the ECG-IJS scheme can be further enhanced by extracting more unique features for individuals and by adopting the optimal vault size and optimal difference tolerances.
