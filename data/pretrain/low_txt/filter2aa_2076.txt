### WarBallooning â€“ Kismet Wireless
#### Eye in the Sky
**Presented by: Rick Hill**
**Event: DEFCON 16**
**Date: Sunday, August 10**

### Introduction
Thank you for joining me today. I will be discussing the concept of WarBallooning, a method that evolved from "WarRocketing" presented at DEFCON 14. This presentation will cover the advantages and disadvantages of using balloons over rockets, the components and hardware hacks involved, network layout and security, and the experience of flying a WarBalloon.

### WarBallooning Concept
- **WarDriving Limitations**: In urban areas, WarDriving has limited visibility.
- **Gas Costs**: High gas prices ($4.00/gallon) make driving less feasible.
- **Balloon as a Platform**: Balloons offer a better platform than rockets for covering 5-10 mile urban areas.
- **Questions Welcome**: Feel free to ask questions during the talk.

### Project Overview
- **Evolution from WarRocketing (DEFCON 14)**: 
  - **Good Points**: Novel concept, high altitude.
  - **Bad Points**: Requires explosives permits, restricted to rural areas, limited operation time due to parachute drift.
- **New Platform (Balloon vs. Rocket)**:
  - **Balloon Advantages**:
    - Helium cost is $20/lb. payload lift.
    - More acceptable to authorities.
    - Still restricted near airports.

### Design Considerations
- **Lightweight Components**: All components must be lightweight.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Energy efficiency is crucial.
- **Safety**: Avoid hydrogen (Hindenburg incident).
- **Passive Wireless Software**: Use Kismet for passive monitoring.
- **Secure Network**: Ensure network security.

---

### Hardware Components
- **Balloon**: Professional aerial photography balloon.
- **WRT54G, v2**: Router with modified firmware.
- **DLink 5220 Security Camera**: For video surveillance.
- **Fiber Optic Transceivers**: Secure, high-bandwidth, low-weight communication.
- **Yagi Antenna and Omni Antenna**: For directional and omnidirectional coverage.
- **Container**: Igloo Cooler Co. container for housing equipment.

---

### Software Components
- **Kismet Server and Drone**: For wireless network monitoring.
- **Talisman 1.3.6**: Network security tool.
- **Web Browser**: For DLink 5220 camera view and control.
- **Suse Linux**: Operating system.
- **Flite Festival Speech Synthesis Software**: For voice alerts.
- **Kismac**: Mac-based wireless network scanner.
- **UNIX Utilities**: SSH v2, etc.

### Hardware/Software Hacks
- **WRT54G**:
  - Installed Talisman, SSH, and Kismet drone.
  - Moved antenna connector.
  - Removed case and mounted in Igloo "Mini-Mate".
- **DLink 5220 Camera**:
  - Added external antenna.
  - Mounted in Igloo cooler.
- **Fiber Optic Link**:
  - Inherently secure and high bandwidth.
  - Low weight (50 meters / 1.5 lbs).
  - Used regular multimode fiber.
- **Fiber Optic Transceiver**:
  - Case removed for integration.
- **Completed Payload**: Integrated and tested all components.

### IP-Based Robotics
- **DLink 5220 Camera**:
  - CCD camera, web server, and pan & tilt controller.
  - Pan motor used to aim the high-gain antenna at targets.
  - Controllable via web interface (speed, focus, snapshots, MPEG video).
- **Other IP Robotics**:
  - **Phy2Phy Project**: [http://phy2phy.wikidot.com/start]
  - **SCADA Systems**:
    - MODICON PLCs, Siemens PLCs.
    - [http://www.controlbyweb.com/products.html]
- **Security Concerns**:
  - Digital Bond's work on SCADA security.
  - Nessus plugins for SCADA systems.
  - Homeland Security and Department of Energy involvement.

### Network Layout
- **Balloon Network**:
  - **WRT54G**: Passive monitoring, data streamed to Kismet Server on ground hard drive.
  - **DLink 5220 Camera & AP**:
    - Web server controls camera and antenna movement.
    - Camera AP disabled.
    - Video streamed to ground hard drive.
    - Possible EVDO link to the internet via Verizon Aircard.
    - Cell phone browsing of aerial pictures.
- **Network Security**:
  - Closed network with fiber optic transmission.
  - SSH and certificates for command line access to WRT54G.
  - AP not possible in drone mode (IDS).
  - DDNS use.

### Flying the WarBalloon
- **Challenges**:
  - **FAA Approval**: The biggest challenge was obtaining FAA approval.
  - **Letter to Las Vegas Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON)**:
    - Proposed Balloon Display over the Riviera Hotel.
    - Detailed description and operating plan provided.
    - Balloon specifications: 6 ft. diameter, 113 cu. ft. helium capacity, 3.5 lb. payload, self-deploying parachute.
    - Operation: Moored via tether line, monitored, flown at <150 ft. AGL, daylight operation only.
    - Nearby building heights considered: Turnberry Towers (477 ft.) and Wynn (614 ft.).
- **Test Flight**: Virginia test flight on June 29.

### Summary
- **Advantages of Aerial Platforms**: Superior line-of-sight to WiFi targets.
- **Wind Conditions**:
  - No wind: Perfect for directional antenna.
  - 5 MPH: Manageable.
  - 10 MPH: Use omni-directional antenna.
  - 15 MPH: Not recommended.
- **DEFCON Results**: To be determined.
