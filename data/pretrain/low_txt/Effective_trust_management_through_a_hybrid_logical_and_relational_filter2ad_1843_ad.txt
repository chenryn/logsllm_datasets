# Performance Evaluation and Future Optimizations

## Figure 5: Performance Results from Evaluation within the VO Scenario

- **Figure 5(a)**: Varied database complexity
- **Figure 5(b)**: Varied rule complexity
- **Figure 5(c)**: Capability query

### Detailed Analysis

**Figure 5(c)** illustrates the average time required to execute capability queries over medium-sized databases with varying levels of complexity (low, medium, high). The brute force approach, which involves performing a proof of compliance query for each possible role in the database, is compared against the algorithm presented in Section 4.3. As expected, our algorithm outperforms the brute force approach in all cases. Specifically, it excels when a higher percentage of roles are defined using intersection containment, as it can leverage forward chaining more effectively.

### 5.4 Future Optimizations

While the use of dynamic views described in this paper offers the advantage of seamlessly adapting to changes in underlying policies, the previous experiments show that this comes at a significant cost as policies become increasingly nested. One solution to this problem is to compile logical policies into materialized views rather than dynamic ones. Materialized views are generated by issuing the query that defines the view and saving the result set as a table within the database. Additionally, materialized views can be indexed, whereas dynamic views cannot. This would allow queries to any role managed within the database to be executed at the same speed as queries to the base tables. The data in Figures 5(a)–(b) suggest that this would result in substantial performance gains. Although MySQL currently does not support materialized views, we plan to explore this in the future using a DBMS like PostgreSQL or Oracle.

#### Efficiency vs. Cost

The efficiency gains from materialized views do come with some costs:
1. **Space Requirements**: Materialized views require much more space within the database (thousands of rows) compared to dynamic views (stored as a single query).
2. **Regeneration**: Materialized views must be regenerated on-the-fly to remain consistent with changes made to the tables and views over which they are defined (e.g., when logical policies are edited).

However, these issues are not expected to cause significant problems in practice:
- **Disk and Memory Space**: Even low-end enterprise servers have abundant disk and memory space.
- **Update Costs**: Figures 5(a)-(b) imply that the cost of carrying out even complete updates to a materialized view would be very low. Often, complete updates are not needed to keep materialized views consistent, so these figures can be seen as a conservative estimate of update costs.

## 6. Related Work

Digital credentials are a primary technique for access control in cross-domain collaboration and resource sharing. Due to the decentralized nature of such applications, digital credentials have evolved from simple bindings between public keys and identities to signed statements with rich semantics, including roles, properties, logical inference rules, and even arbitrary programs. Extensive work has been done in the areas of trust management, trust negotiation, and distributed proofs. These systems consider both centralized and decentralized credentials. In terms of trust evaluation, most work focuses on compliance checking, i.e., determining through logical inferences whether a principal belongs to a particular role or possesses certain privileges.

- **Trust Management Systems on Commodity DBMSs**: Except for [11], no previous work has considered building trust management systems on top of commodity DBMSs. [11] focuses on using databases as credential stores for trust management, while our focus is on utilizing the data processing capabilities of DBMSs to improve trust policy evaluation performance.
- **Reputation-Based Trust**: Reputation-based trust has been extensively studied in agent systems, online auctions, pervasive computing, and P2P systems. Its integration with credential-based trust is a recent development.
- **Traditional Access Control**: Traditional access control is often identity-based, implemented through access control lists (ACL), capability lists, or access control trips. CPOL [8] achieves high-performance policy evaluation through indexing and caching techniques but focuses on simple delegation and location and temporal constraints. CTM, on the other hand, supports more types of delegations and the combination of credentials with reputations.
- **Credential Chain Discovery Algorithms**: Li et al. [22] designed algorithms for answering three types of queries for RT, but their algorithms do not leverage existing software systems or tools. Our approach aims to utilize as much functionality as possible from DBMSs to make the trust evaluation engine efficient, lightweight, and easy to deploy.
- **Logic Programming Languages**: While it is possible to build a trust policy evaluation engine using logic programming languages like Prolog and Datalog, such languages are not well supported in commercial information systems. We emphasize leveraging the data processing capabilities of existing IT infrastructures to make trust evaluation engines efficient, lightweight, and easy to deploy.

## 7. Conclusion

Despite promising research into trust management approaches to authorization, little attention has been given to how these technologies can be effectively deployed. In this paper, we address one potential avenue for supporting the deployment of logical trust management approaches by leveraging relational databases. We developed a two-tiered framework consisting of a logical front end and a relational back end. We showed that simple role membership credentials and reputation feedback reports can be efficiently managed in the DBMSs base tables and presented a method for compiling collections of logical CTM credentials into dynamic views stored in the database. This relational representation can be used to quickly perform proof of compliance checks or enumerate all members of a given role. We also developed a novel algorithm for answering capability queries that leverages forward chaining and the database's ability to perform complex joins and aggregations. An initial evaluation of an unoptimized prototype implementation shows that our proposed approach is viable even under pessimistic assumptions regarding credential complexity.

In the future, we plan to optimize the relational side of our framework, particularly by exploring the use of materialized views. We will examine the relative costs involved, including increased disk and memory utilization and overheads associated with keeping these views consistent with changes to the underlying ruleset. We also plan to investigate effective means of applying our proposed framework within decentralized organizations and to support circular dependent roles in DBMSs through recursive queries.
