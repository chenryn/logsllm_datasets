### Distance Decrease in Noncoherent Scenarios

In the noncoherent scenario 802.15.4a (NC), the maximum distance decrease can reach up to 2461.6 meters. This type of attack represents a fundamental limitation of any noncoherent PPM/BPM system, and its success is independent of the shape and duration of the pulse burst. Both results are listed in Table II, where they are compared to the distance decrease possible under UWB-PR.

Regardless of the configuration chosen in 802.15.4a, higher symbol energy comes at the cost of longer symbol duration, which, in turn, leads to higher distance decreases in a noncoherent setting. This behavior is compared to UWB-PR in Figure 13.

### Summary of Insights

With cryptographic reordering and blinding missing, the deterministic time-coding of 802.15.4a and 802.15.4f makes both approaches vulnerable to ED/LC attacks. In 802.15.4f, we find a modulation scheme that provides atomic building blocks that can be effectively interleaved for security. UWB-PR builds on 802.15.4f and introduces reordering of pulses among bit-wise time intervals to gain resistance against all physical-layer attacks, including ED/LC attacks. An overview of these considerations is provided in Table III.

### Limitations

UWB-PR prevents all physical-layer attacks that would allow an attacker to decrease the distance between the verifier and the trusted prover (Relay Attack, Mafia Fraud). However, UWB-PR does not prevent a malicious prover from reducing the measured distance (Distance Fraud). An attacker who knows the reordering and XOR sequence cannot be prevented from transmitting the reply early. This attacker can send the appropriate response \( n_{PR} \) as soon as it has observed at least one pulse of each bit in \( n_{VE} \).

However, the reordering operation could also be a vital part of a solution to this problem. We argue that distance fraud could be prevented by keeping the reordering secret from the prover. The prover would then intermingle its nonce with the verifier’s challenge purely on the physical layer, for example, by adding the \( n_{PR} \) signal onto the received \( n_{VE} \) signal before transmitting the combined signal back. Precise time alignment is guaranteed by the preamble and serves to convince the verifier that the secret challenge was actually handled by the prover. Because the reordering is not known to the prover, it is not able to decode the challenge. As a consequence, the early inference of the challenge bit sequence \( n_{VE} \) can be prevented.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we presented UWB-PR, a modulation scheme that secures ranging against all physical-layer attacks that enable Mafia Fraud. We provided quantifiable probabilistic security guarantees without making any assumptions regarding channel conditions or attacker positions. We showed that UWB-PR is unique compared to existing UWB systems in that it allows long-distance ranging without compromising on security. Measurements obtained with a prototype implementation of UWB-PR were aligned with this finding.

### Appendix

To understand the impact of the reordering on attack success, we analyze a particular instance of UWB-PR. The idea is to determine the probability of attack success for different numbers of bits reordered under the multi-power attacker model and an optimal attack termination point.

#### Reordering Process
Instead of reordering all pulses randomly, we follow a specific process. We create \( N_P \) subsets, and each subset has \( N_B \) pulses, where \( N_P \) is the number of pulses per symbol and \( N_B \) is the number of bits reordered. The \( N_B \) pulses of each subset belong to exactly \( N_B \) different bits. However, each subset hides the mapping differently, by using a different reordering and XOR sequence. Figure 14 shows an example of this reordering process.

#### Attack Strategy
The attacker is aware of the statistical distribution, i.e., \( N_B \) and \( N_P \), and knows that each pulse of the subset belongs to a different bit. This knowledge gives a bias to the attacker, even towards the end of the attack, the attacker has a non-zero probability of producing a positive contribution on each bit. However, he doesn’t know the reordering and XOR sequence applied on the subset. To maximize the likelihood of positive net power per bit, an attacker needs to decide energy levels for the attack on each pulse and the point of attack termination.

For the choice of the energy level, we suggest the following:
- Within a subset, the same energy level is used for each pulse. Given that all pulses belong to different bits, and the attacker does not know the pulse-to-bit mapping, all pulses are equally probable to belong to a certain bit.
- When transitioning from one subset to another, the attacker can decide to use the same, increase, or decrease the energy level. In our model, we choose the minimum energy level that will maximize the likelihood of positive net power per bit, given that the next pulse polarity is guessed correctly. As long as negative per-bit correlations remain, this is equivalent to doubling the power per pulse upon transitioning.

The energy choice according to this model ensures that the correct guess of a pulse brings the attacker closer to winning, and an incorrect guess can be corrected in the next subset. However, in the process of fixing a wrong interference of a bit, the attacker can end up interfering with another bit. Suppose in one subset the attacker guesses the polarity of \( (N_B - 1) \) pulses correctly but guesses one wrong. To maximize his chances of success in the next subset, he needs to guess the polarity of the pulse of this particular bit correctly. In the process of correcting this bit, if the attacker attacks a pulse in the next subset, the probability of correcting this bit is \( (0.5 \times \frac{1}{N_B}) \), and causing a negative contribution to another bit is \( (0.5 \times \frac{N_B - 1}{N_B}) \). By increasing the number of bits reordered, the probability of interfering with the wrong bit increases. An attacker also needs to be careful about when to terminate the attack. In the example shown in Figure 14, an attacker can stop interfering after the second or third position of the third subset. After interfering with the second pulse of the third subset, the attacker already knows that \( P_{\text{win}} \) is 0.16. He can choose to proceed or terminate the attack at this point. For calculating the results, as shown in Figure 12, we assume that the attacker continues and terminates the attack at the third position of the third subset, where \( P_{\text{win}} \) is 0.25.
