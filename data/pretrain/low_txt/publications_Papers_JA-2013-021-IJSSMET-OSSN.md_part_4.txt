### Introduction

This document discusses the use of Linked USDL (Unified Service Description Language) in two major projects: FI-WARE and FINEST. These initiatives leverage Linked USDL to enhance service description and management, and they serve as application fields for Open Semantic Service Networks (OSSNs). Additionally, the document addresses the need to extend current RDF repositories, such as Sesame, with a federation layer to improve efficiency.

### 6.1. The FI-WARE Project

The FI-WARE project is part of the EU Future Internet Public-Private Partnership (PPP) program. Its primary goal is to deliver a service infrastructure that offers reusable and shared functionality for service-oriented businesses in the cloud. The Application and Services Ecosystem and Provisioning Framework focuses on business aspects of service ecosystems, including:

- Describing and exposing services
- Aggregation and composition
- Service marketplaces
- Business models
- Execution and revenue sharing

To achieve these goals, it is essential to improve business processes within the service network ecosystem. A key aspect is increasing the degree of automation in planning, monitoring, resource management, and collaboration. For example, in the planning phase, it is necessary to support searching and matching transport service offerings. One of the major challenges is to make service offerings and capacities transparent in a globally uniform way.

#### Role of OSSNs

Open Semantic Service Networks (OSSNs) provide a rich knowledge base for service discovery and matching. Since a service is connected to other services and business elements (e.g., providers, suppliers, partners, competitors) via an Open Semantic Service Repository (OSSR), the marketplace can utilize this information to achieve more effective matching. The FI-WARE marketplace, which provides a wide range of functionalities, can go beyond matching and improve recommendations, ratings, market intelligence, and price calculation support.

### 6.2. The FINEST Project

The FINEST project aims to support the transport and logistics (T&L) ecosystem, where many service providers collaborate to transport goods over a consecutive chain of different legs. The main challenges in the T&L domain include:

- Reducing logistics costs
- Increasing customer responsiveness
- Achieving profitable growth
- Improving working capital efficiency
- Enhancing quality
- Reducing the order-to-delivery cycle

#### Use of Linked USDL

The FINEST consortium has chosen Linked USDL as the basis for describing and publishing transport and logistics service offerings in their platform. The power of the Linked Data approach, followed by Linked USDL, allows FINEST to extend and combine core USDL service vocabularies with dedicated T&L vocabularies. This enables the description of non-functional service properties, pricing, and service level models. The benefit is that generic enablers for service repository, marketplace services, composition, and mashup can be used and adapted to the T&L domain.

For the FINEST T&L platform to support the concept of OSSN, it is necessary to model service relationships between the service systems provided by stakeholders. This involves using the OSSR model to create relationships between planning companies, tendering agencies, consignees, transport companies, freight forwarders, carriers, warehouses, harbors, port authorities, shippers, customs, and more. These relationships can identify the role of the service systems involved, the level at which a relationship is established, the strength of the relationship, and the comparison of service systems involved (Cardoso, 2013).

### 7. Conclusion

Networks play an increasingly important role in many fields, including the Internet, the World Wide Web, social networks, and Linked Data. Service networks are another class of networks of emerging interest, as worldwide economies become more connected and service-oriented. This article presents methodological, conceptual, and technological foundations for creating a global Open Semantic Service Network. The primary challenge is that business services' information is often hidden in unstructured marketplaces and corporate websites, and no information about service relationships is available.

To construct service networks, four premises must be fulfilled:

1. **Accessibility**: Information on service systems must be open and remotely accessible.
2. **Semantic Relationships**: Service models need to be related using rich, open semantic relationships to handle the heterogeneity of the Web and business industries.
3. **Platform Support**: Construction of service networks requires massively parallel platforms for querying, integrating, and aligning service models.
4. **Analytic Methods**: Algorithms, simulation, and analytic methods are needed to understand, describe, explain, analyze, predict, and control the evolution of global service networks over time.
