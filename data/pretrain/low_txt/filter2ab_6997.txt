**ATT&CK ID:** T0873  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Project File Infection

Adversaries may attempt to infect project files with malicious code. These project files typically include objects, program organization units, variables (such as tags), documentation, and other configurations necessary for the proper functioning of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programs. By leveraging the built-in functions of engineering software, adversaries can download an infected program to a PLC in the operational environment, thereby enabling further execution and persistence techniques.
