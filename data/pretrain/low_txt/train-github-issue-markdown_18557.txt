### Issue with Select Component in `1.0-beta.27`

**Description:**
The select component in `1.0-beta.27` does not update the selection when typing while the dropdown is open.

**I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.**

### Expected Behavior
When a select field is focused and the user begins to type, the selection should change to match the input, allowing for quick navigation through the options.

### Current Behavior
Currently, typing while the select dropdown is open has no effect; the selection does not change.
