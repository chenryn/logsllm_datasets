### Overview

- **Attack & Penetration Testing:** Accuvant LABS
- **Open Source Projects:** easy-creds, smbexec, Kali Linux

---

### What is smbexec?

#### Key Points:
- **Functionality:** Automates post-exploitation tasks.
- **Automation:** Simplifies and streamlines the process.
- **Immediate Use:** Ready to use out-of-the-box.
- **Ease of Use:** Makes post-exploitation tasks much easier.

---

### Development Details

- **Script Type:** Bash script.
- **Development Time:** One week, fueled by a year's worth of Mountain Dew.
- **Core Tools:** smbclient and winexe.
  - **smbclient:** Used for file transfer (get/put).
  - **winexe:** Used for remote command execution.

---

### Motivation for smbexec

- **AV Evasion:** Standard Metasploit payloads were being detected by AV software.
- **Custom Executables:** Also detected due to injection triggers.
- **Inspiration:** Blog post from Carnal0wnage.
- **Objective:** Upload and execute payloads without detection.

---

### Features of smbexec

- **Obfuscation:** Creates obfuscated payloads that bypass most commercial AV.
- **Metasploit Integration:** Generates an rc file and launches a Metasploit listener for ease of use.

---

### Going Native

- **Winexe Capabilities:**
  - Similar to Sysinternals psexec.
  - No payload necessary.
  - Traffic appears normal to OPSEC.

- **System-Level Execution:**
  - Execute commands as SYSTEM.
  - Virtually limitless possibilities.

---

### Key Functions

- **Hash Dumping:**
  - Workstations and servers.
  - Uses `reg.exe` to save registry hives.
  - Converts hashes to John format using creddump.

- **Volume Shadow Copy:**
  - Creates and manages VSC.
  - Extracts SYS key and ntds.dit.
  - Automates NTDSXtract and libesedb for hash extraction.

- **Clear Text Passwords:**
  - Integrates WCE (Windows Credential Editor) with permission from the developer.
  - Automatically runs as part of the hash grab functionality.

---

### Demonstration

- **smbexec Hashgrab Demo:**
  - Practical example of hash grabbing.

---

### Caveats

- **Credential Requirements:**
  - Admin rights on the target system (local or domain).
  - Common starting point: `administrator:password`.
  - NBNS spoofing can be used.
  - MS08-067 exploit as a fallback.

- **Potential Issues:**
  - Winexe creates a service, which could be flagged.
  - AV may still detect WCE.
  - Requires authentication over port 139 or 445.
  - Follows Locard's exchange principle: "Every contact leaves a trace."

---
