### Video Stream Analysis and Network Configurations

Despite the similarities in the video streams, some differences were observed, which can be attributed to variations in server technology and network configurations. It is worthwhile to briefly review these differences and their causes.

The primary difference noted was the requirement for significantly higher token rates to achieve near-perfect video quality. Our maximum token rate was constrained by the V.35 link between routers 2 and 3, which operated at approximately 2 Mbps. This limitation prevented us from achieving an ideal quality score of 0 when the token bucket depth was set to 3000 bytes, even though the "maximum" encoding rate for both clips was limited to about 1 Mbps (see Table 3). In other words, despite a token rate that was roughly twice the maximum encoding rate, we were unable to reach the best quality level. Increasing the token bucket depth to 4500 bytes largely resolved this issue. The main reason for this behavior is the bursty nature of the server's output.

The experimental results reported are primarily limited to the 1 Mbps clip because we could not achieve acceptable quality levels at higher rates with the given network configurations. This was observed even after switching to TCP streaming and using traffic shaping on the Linux router connected to the server. UDP streaming remained too bursty, making it difficult to conduct meaningful experiments. TCP streaming, due to its intrinsic rate adaptation capability, resulted in a smoother traffic flow and better quality outcomes.

### Local Testbed Experiments

**Figure 15: Local Testbed Experiments (Lost Clip at 1Mbps) – Quality and Frame Loss vs Token Rate**

- **Quality Index, B=3000**
- **Frame Loss, B=3000**
- **Quality Index, B=4500**
- **Frame Loss, B=4500**

A significant point to emphasize is that increasing the token bucket depth from 3000 bytes to 4500 bytes had a more substantial impact on video quality in this setting. Allowing a slight increase in bucket size yielded much larger benefits with this type of server and encoding compared to constant rate encoding with servers that attempt to pace their transmissions, as seen in the QBone experiments. This supports the consideration of slightly larger bucket sizes than the two MTUs limit originally suggested for services based on the EF PHB.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we conducted an experimental investigation into the relationship between user-level video quality and various network configurations embodying a service based on the Diff-Serv EF PHB. The experiments considered different types of video clips, encoding rates, video servers, and evaluated the quality of received video streams transmitted over both local and wide-area (QBone) testbeds for different settings of the token bucket associated with the "service" assigned to the stream. The quality assessment was performed using an objective measurement tool that accurately estimates video quality as perceived by users. The main focus was on the impact of the dropping actions performed by the policer on non-conformant packets.

One key finding was that frame loss itself is not always an accurate measure of video quality. The evolution of frame loss and video quality is often decoupled, meaning that large increases in allocated rate do not necessarily translate into significant quality improvements, while small additional bandwidth can yield drastically better video quality. This conclusion does not appear to depend significantly on the type of video used, but the exact relation between video quality and frame loss (or token rate) does depend on the type of server and encoding used. Generally, a token rate larger than the encoding rate is needed to achieve high-quality video. The required margin above the encoding rate depends on the specific server and encoding used.

Another interesting finding is that a small increase in the token bucket depth used by the policer can result in substantial improvements in the quality of the received video. However, this should be balanced against the increased burstiness it allows and its potential impact on frame losses and delays in the network. A larger token bucket means that larger EF bursts can enter the network, potentially leading to the accumulation of larger bursts as the EF traffic traverses multiple hops. Given the magnitude of the observed improvements and the relatively small increase in token bucket depth required, this may be a viable option when building services that use the EF PHB, especially since increasing the potential burst size by one MTU (from two to three) is unlikely to contribute significantly to burstiness in the network for moderate EF loads.
