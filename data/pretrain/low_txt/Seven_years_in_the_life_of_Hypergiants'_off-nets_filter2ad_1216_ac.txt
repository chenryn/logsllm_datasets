### Hypergiant's Fingerprint

To assign an IP address to an Autonomous System (AS), we use standard IP-to-AS mapping techniques, as described in Appendix A.1. We also annotate the on-nets and off-nets of Hypergiants (HGs) as detailed in Appendix A.2.

### 4.6 Datasets

**Certificate Datasets:**
Rapid7 collects X.509 certificates observed during IPv4-wide scans on port 443 [67]. We utilize datasets from October 2013 to April 2021, which include 127,812,006 unique certificates. Additionally, we supplement these with port 443 scans from Censys [36] from November 2019 to April 2021. Certificates that cannot be translated into the X.509 format or are missing critical information are excluded.

**HTTP(S) Headers:**
We use the corpus of available HTTP(S) headers from Rapid7, spanning from October 2013 to April 2021.

**List of Hypergiants:**
We compile a list of HGs using previously published surveys [18, 19, 32, 64, 112]. We then select the 23 HGs that claim on their websites to have a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and for which we were able to identify a certificate with a matching Organization. The examined HGs are: Akamai, Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, Bamtech, Highwinds, CDN77, Cachefly, Cdnetworks, Chinacache, Cloudflare, Disney, Facebook, Fastly, Google, Hulu, Incapsula, Limelight, Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter, Verizon, and Yahoo.

### 5. Validation

We find that our scanning and measurement techniques are accurate. We validate our results against information from Hypergiants and results from earlier approaches, confirming that our results are trustworthy.

**Comparison of Scanning Corpuses:**
Most of our results rely on Rapid7 scans. We first evaluate the completeness of Rapid7 scans compared to Censys and an active scan we conducted (November 21-25, 2019) of the entire publicly-routable non-bogon IPv4 address space for SSL/TLS certificates on port 443. We used a modified version of the certigo tool [97] to perform TLS handshakes with servers to fetch their certificates. Our scan fetched 13,156,080 unique end-entity certificates.

Table 2 compares our scan with Rapid7 and Censys scans from November 2019. The number of IP addresses with certificates in Rapid7 and Censys is very similar. However, our certigo scan found approximately 20% more addresses, attributed to two causes. First, both Rapid7 and Censys must respond to complaints and remove IP addresses from their scans [12, 29, 110], leading to more address space being excluded over time. Second, our scan took almost four days to execute, potentially triggering less rate limiting than the other, faster scans.

When we consider the total number of ASes that host at least one HG (column 6), the numbers across all three datasets are very similar, as are the four Hypergiants with the largest footprints (Google, Netflix, Facebook, and Akamai) reported in the last four columns. Another observation is that the number of IP addresses per HG is not indicative of the size or distribution of the corresponding HGs' off-nets, as each HG has a different strategy for assigning IPs to servers [42]. For example, in our active scan (November 2019), we collected Facebook certificates from 33,769 IP addresses in 1,708 off-net ASes, while we collected Akamai certificates from many more IP addresses (105,686) although Akamai’s off-net footprint is smaller, with 1,194 off-net ASes. Thus, for the rest of the paper, we will focus on the off-net AS footprint of each Hypergiant.

**Ethical Considerations:**
In our scan, we adhere to best practices [37] to avoid triggering any alarms. We maintain a blacklist and use clients with appropriate rDNS names, websites, and abuse contacts. Therefore, this work does not raise any ethical issues.

**Active Measurement Validation:**
We provide additional validation of our inferences using active measurements. We use the ZGrab2 [115] tool, which provides rapid capture of HTTP(S) banners, including HTTP headers and TLS certificate validation. We provide an input list of (IP address, domain) pairs, and ZGrab2 correctly sets the HTTP Host header and TLS SNI field while performing a GET request for the default document.

In this analysis, we assert that if we correctly infer a server to be an off-net for a particular Hypergiant, it should not serve requests for domains which the Hypergiant does not host (i.e., TLS validation should fail). To test this, for each IP address inferred as an off-net for a particular Hypergiant, we randomly select 10 other Hypergiants and, for each, scan the IP address requesting one of the 50 most popular domains served by the other Hypergiant. Surprisingly, we found that only 89.7% of the inferred off-nets did not validate for the randomly selected domains. Of the 10.3% that correctly validated requests, 97% were inferred as belonging to Akamai, and the request domains (LinkedIn, KDDI, Disney) were known to be served by third-party CDNs such as Akamai. This result highlights a challenge in understanding the content delivery ecosystem: Large content providers may select a combination of self-hosted and external CDNs for redundancy and additional capacity (§3). Nevertheless, Akamai is the exception in our analysis, as it does not create its own content or have its own users, and its platform delivers the content of other companies, much like a "cloud provider" for content delivery.

**Validation from Hypergiants:**
We surveyed HG operators following a similar approach to earlier work on mapping ISPs [98]. The survey questions are presented in Appendix A.4. Four HGs replied to our request for validation, including some of the four largest. All four agreed that the estimation of the off-net footprint is very good. One HG operator indicated that 6% of ASes we identified as hosting the HG’s off-nets were not on the HG’s list, and 11% from the HG’s list were not uncovered by our technique (while also indicating that the HG’s list may not be 100% correct). For the other three HGs, we underestimated the HG footprint by 5% (one HG) or around 10% (two HGs). Our technique may miss or misidentify ASes hosting HG off-nets due to errors in IP-to-AS mapping, ASes that have opted out of TLS scans, or churn between when we measure and when validation was done. The off-nets we missed were in a mix of different types of networks. Our results are in line with Akamai’s public reports for the duration of our study [4].

**Comparison to Earlier Results:**
Our technique works with existing datasets, enabling the comparison of our results with prior studies using different methodologies.

**Google:**
We compare our results with the latest results from a previously published approach to uncovering Google off-nets [22], which reported 1445 ASes hosting Google off-nets in April 2016. Of the 1445 ASes, our approach identified 1421 (98%), while also identifying an additional 283 (68 of which the earlier technique identified prior to April 2016).

**Facebook:**
To the best of our knowledge, the only previous work reporting numbers for Facebook’s CDN belongs to a team that participated in a hackathon [13] in March 2018 and posted updated results in August 2018, November 2019 [14], and April 2021 [15]. The team mapped Facebook servers globally by guessing.
