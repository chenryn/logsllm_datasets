#### Main Content
Batteryless devices often rely on timers with hourglass-like precision to throttle queries. The TARDIS, a purely software-based mechanism, is easily deployable on devices equipped with SRAM. A unique feature of the TARDIS is its use of memory decay or data remanence to enhance security rather than compromise it. Without the TARDIS, batteryless devices would be unable to provide accurate time.

#### Appendix
**Model of Decay Probabilities**

Knowing the DRV (Data Retention Voltage) distribution of a collection of SRAM cells allows us to predict the amount of memory decay that will result from reaching any known minimum supply voltage during a power cycle. We propose a simple and intuitive 3-parameter (α, μ, σ) model to characterize the DRV distribution. The parameters are chosen such that the model predictions agree with empirical data relating memory decay to minimum supply voltage.

Cells eligible for memory decay after being written with a value of 1 are those with a ground state of 0. We use \( g = 0 \) to denote cells with a 0 ground state, and use \( \alpha \) to denote the fraction of cells with this ground state; \( \alpha \) is therefore the largest fraction of cells that can decay after writing a 1 to all cells.

\[ \Pr(g = 0) = \alpha \]

Among cells that are eligible for memory decay, we assume that DRVs are normally distributed with mean \( \mu \) and standard deviation \( \sigma \).

\[ \text{DRV} | (g = 0) \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) \]

The probability of a randomly selected cell being eligible for memory decay and having DRV = \( v \) is given by:

\[ \Pr((g = 0) \land (\text{DRV} = v)) = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} e^{-\frac{(v-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \]

If the minimum voltage of a power cycle is known, the 3-parameter model can predict the memory decay. The cells that will decay are eligible cells with a DRV that is above the minimum supply voltage reached during the power cycle. A closed-form equation for predicting the memory decay from the minimum voltage and model parameters is then given by:

\[ D_{\text{PRED}}(v_{\text{min}}, \alpha, \mu, \sigma) = \alpha \left(1 - \frac{1 + \operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{v_{\text{min}} - \mu}{\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right)}{2}\right) \]

A 3-parameter model is evaluated based on how well its predicted memory decay matches empirical data. The evaluation is performed using a set of \( n \) observations \((v_0, D(v_0)), (v_1, D(v_1)), \ldots, (v_{n-1}, D(v_{n-1}))\); each observation is a measurement of the minimum supply voltage reached during a power cycle and the memory decay observed across that power cycle. The prediction error of any model is defined according to:

\[ \text{ERR}(\alpha, \mu, \sigma) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \left(D_{\text{PRED}}(v_i, \alpha, \mu, \sigma) - D(v_i)\right)^2 \]

After measurements are used to fit the model parameters to empirical data, the model is subsequently used to predict memory-decay-vs.-time curves from voltage-vs.-time measurements.
