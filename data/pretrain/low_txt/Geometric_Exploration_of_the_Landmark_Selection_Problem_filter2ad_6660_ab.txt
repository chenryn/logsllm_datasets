### Reporting and Evaluation of Landmark Selection Algorithms

For these reasons, we also report the 90th percentile of relative error. 

In applying the algorithms for landmark selection, we proceed as follows:

- **AMP Dataset**: We select \(\ell\) landmarks from the 116 hosts using each algorithm. The relative error of the Virtual Landmarks embedding is then evaluated for the remaining \(116 - \ell\) hosts.
- **Skitter and Sockeye Datasets**: We randomly subsample 2000 hosts from the set of measurement targets. From this subset, we select \(\ell\) landmarks and evaluate the relative error of the Virtual Landmarks embedding on the active sites. For Skitter, this evaluation is over 12 hosts, and for Sockeye, it is over 11 hosts. Despite the small sample sizes, the consistency of our results suggests that they are reasonably representative.

### Main Results

In Figures 4, 5, and 6, we present our main results. Each figure shows the average absolute relative error on the left and the 90th percentile of absolute relative error on the right.

- **AMP Hosts (Figure 4)**: The Greedy algorithm performs distinctly better than the others, regardless of the number of landmarks. The Random, K-means, and Maximum Distance algorithms have similar performance, with the Random algorithm showing slightly poorer worst-case performance.

  These results can be understood in the context of the AMP hosts, which are generally located in North America with good connections to the high-speed Abilene network. For these hosts, the specific choice of landmark set is not critical, but a more expensive (Greedy) approach still provides some benefits.

- **Skitter and Sockeye Datasets (Figures 5 and 6)**: The Greedy algorithm remains the best, as expected. However, there are notable differences among the other algorithms:
  - **Maximum Distance** performs poorly, possibly because the landmarks it selects, while far from most hosts, have limited path diversity, providing poor location information.
  - **K-means** performs well even with a small set of landmarks.
  - **Random** performs poorly with a small set of landmarks but becomes comparable to K-means when a larger set (approximately 20-30 landmarks) is used. This effect is particularly pronounced when considering the 90th percentile of absolute relative error.

### Conclusions

Our results suggest the following conclusions:
- The Greedy algorithm is the best-performing approach, but it is computationally expensive.
- For a small number of landmarks (5-10), the geometrically-based K-means algorithm is the best efficient alternative.
- If a larger set of landmarks (approximately 20-30) is used, simple Random selection works well.

These findings indicate that effective landmark selection is feasible even on the scale of the Internet, provided the appropriate algorithm is chosen based on the number of landmarks and computational resources available.
