## Abstract

This panel highlights a selection of the most interesting and provocative papers from the 2004 New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW). The workshop was held in September 2004. The panel consists of authors of the selected papers, and the session is moderated by the workshop’s general chairs. We present selected papers focusing on major themes that emerged from the workshop, which are expected to provoke the most engaging discussions at ACSAC.

## Panel Theme

The panel presents a selection of the best, most interesting, and most provocative work from the New Security Paradigms Workshop 2004. For thirteen years, NSPW has provided a productive and highly interactive forum for innovative approaches to computer security. 

NSPW is an invitational workshop with a deliberately small size to facilitate deep, meaningful discussions of new ideas. Authors are encouraged to present work that might be considered risky in other settings. All participants are charged with providing constructive feedback. This brainstorming environment has proven to be an excellent medium for advancing "far out" and visionary ideas.

Our philosophy is to seek significantly new paradigms and shifts from previous thinking, fostering debate within a constructive environment of experienced researchers and practitioners, as well as newer participants in the field. In keeping with the NSPW philosophy, this panel challenges many of the dominant paradigms in information security. Expect it to be highly interactive, with lively exchanges between the panelists and the audience. Come prepared with an open mind and ready to question and comment on what our panelists present!

Past NSPW conference panels have covered a wide variety of subjects, including:
- Software engineering of secure systems
- Penetration tolerance
- New directions in cryptography and steganography
- Alternative models of trust and authorization
- User-centered security and end-user defenses
- New models for "boundless networks"
- Deficiencies in traditional definitions of security, secrecy, and integrity
- Security in PDA devices
- Attack modeling
- Offensive information warfare
- The effectiveness of biometrics
- Mechanisms to combat email spam
- A framework for data privacy management

The last NSPW panel at ACSAC 2003 was well received, very lively, and highly praised by the audience, ACSAC organizers, and panelists alike.

Here are some of the latest ideas to emerge from NSPW, aside from those you will hear from the rest of the panelists:
- The idea that defensive information warfare will always fail, and that offensive information warfare is necessary.
- Optimistic security as an access control paradigm, where users are permitted to violate standard access control paradigms in certain situations (e.g., hospitals) in the interests of safety.
- An examination of how market forces may drive the use of protection profiles in the Common Criteria.
- Protocol analysis, enlarging their assumptions to include environment and context.
- A case for reconsidering our approach to information security from the ground up to effectively deal with the problem of information risk.
- A discussion on the nature and definition of old security paradigms, as it is necessary to define the old paradigms before the novelty of "new" ones can be considered with scientific rigor.
- A new system integrity model that is implementation-independent.
- A new method of downgrading that uses decision trees to avoid the inference problem.
- A new approach to helping applications defend themselves while disarming hosts via the use of filters.
- Bug tolerance, a new paradigm that enhances the survivability of flawed systems post hoc.

## Panel Format

The panel will consist of four authors of papers selected by the NSPW 2004 General and Program Chairs, and it will be chaired by the general chair. The NSPW Panel at ACSAC has been well received in previous years, and based on feedback, we continue to work on improving its format. The panel will be organized to maximize audience participation:

1. **Introduction:** The chair will open the panel with introductory remarks.
2. **Presentations:** Each panelist will give a short presentation to convey the key ideas behind their work.
3. **Q&A Sessions:** After each panelist's presentation, there will be a question and answer session with the audience.
4. **Prepared Questions:** To ensure momentum in the discussion, the Panel Chair will have prepared some questions in advance (based on discussions that occurred during the original NSPW presentation).
5. **General Discussion:** If time permits, the chair will lead a general discussion at the end.

The panel presentations and discussions aim to capture the lively interaction and debate that occurs between the audience and panel members during an NSPW presentation. Each proposed ACSAC panelist will be given just five minutes of uninterrupted formal presentation time. The formal presentation is deliberately short to ensure that the paradigm thesis is immediately accessible to the audience and encourages interaction.

So, come to our panel and discover this year’s new paradigms! You’ll either immediately like them or dislike them—and you’ll get the chance to say so!
