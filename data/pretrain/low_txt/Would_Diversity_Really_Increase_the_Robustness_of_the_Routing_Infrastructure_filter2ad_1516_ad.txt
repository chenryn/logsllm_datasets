### 5. Robustness Analysis of the Cenic Topology

Figure 5 illustrates the robustness of the Cenic topology, where node weights are assigned based on the number of customers connected to each router, and the split is chosen to avoid discontiguous partitions.

### 6. Comparison of Robustness in Tier-1 ISP Topology

Table 3 compares the robustness of the Tier-1 ISP topology using the original coloring, the Basic Partition algorithm, and the Extended Partition algorithm. The original coloring uses eight colors, and we set the same number of colors for the Basic Partition algorithm. For the Extended Partition algorithm, we use two colors for backbone routers and six colors for access routers, as only two of the eight implementations in the original coloring are used for backbone routers.

| Metric | Original Coloring | Basic Partition | Extended Partition |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Average Robustness (NSLC) | 0.713 | 0.875 | 0.855 |
| Minimum Robustness (NSLC) | 0.055 | 0.867 | 0.760 |
| Average Robustness (PC) | 0.647 | 0.765 | 0.739 |
| Minimum Robustness (PC) | 0.016 | 0.752 | 0.578 |

**Observations:**
- The original coloring has poor minimum robustness when a color failure affects one of the colors used by the backbone routers.
- Both partition algorithms improve average and minimum robustness by better distributing the available diversity throughout the network.
- The Extended Partition algorithm shows worse minimum robustness due to the constraint that routers can only use implementations adapted to their role, but this is more realistic for Tier-1 ISP networks.

### 7. Diversity and Robustness in the Tier-1 ISP Topology

Figure 6 shows the degree of diversity needed to achieve a certain level of robustness in the Tier-1 ISP topology using the Extended Partition algorithm. Two colors are always used for the backbone routers, and the rest are used for the access routers.

- **Key Findings:**
  - Two colors are sufficient to ensure the robustness of the backbone given the existing redundancy.
  - Good overall robustness (minimum robustness ≥ 0.5 and average robustness ≥ 0.75) is achieved with at least three colors for the access routers, i.e., a total of five colors.

### 8. Related Work

- **Zhang et al. [33]**: First proposed the use of diversity to increase network survivability by inserting diversity at each level of the networking stack.
- **O’Donnell et al. [25]**: Studied the problem of using diversity to limit malware spread on a network topology. They assume nodes run multiple implementations and take online, distributed decisions.
- **Junqueira et al. [17,18]**: Proposed using diversity in a cooperative backup system to protect against correlated host failures due to software vulnerabilities. Their results are analogous to ours in routing infrastructure.

### 9. Discussion

- **External Connections**: ISPs need to ensure at least one external connection in each partition upon a color failure. The Partition algorithm can fix border routers in different partitions to achieve this.
- **Robustness Beyond Connectivity**: Future work will study the impact on higher layers, such as routing, end-to-end quality of service, CPU load, packet loss, and end-to-end delay.
- **General Framework for Network Robustness**: A framework to measure network robustness under any type of failure and impact is needed. This paper presents a first step by studying simultaneous router failures.

### 10. Conclusion

- **Key Contributions**:
  - We have shown that diversity increases the robustness of the routing infrastructure against simultaneous router failures.
  - A small degree of diversity (five implementations: two for backbone, three for access) can provide good robustness.
  - The best way to apply diversity is to partition the network into contiguous regions, considering node roles and replicated nodes.
  - Large networks may already have enough diversity, but it is not being adequately used for robustness. Geographical distribution and changing the relative number of nodes per implementation can enhance robustness.
