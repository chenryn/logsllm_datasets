# G0032: Lazarus Group
## Description
The [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) is a threat actor attributed to the North Korean government, as reported by US-CERT in June 2017 (Citation: US-CERT HIDDEN COBRA June 2017). Active since at least 2009, the group has been linked to several high-profile cyberattacks, including the destructive wiper attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014, which was part of a campaign named Operation Blockbuster by Novetta. The malware used by the [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) correlates with other campaigns such as Operation Flame, Operation 1Mission, Operation Troy, DarkSeoul, and Ten Days of Rain (Citation: Novetta Blockbuster). In late 2017, the group employed KillDisk, a disk-wiping tool, in an attack on a Central American online casino (Citation: Lazarus KillDisk).

Definitions of North Korean threat groups often overlap, and the name [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) is sometimes used broadly to encompass a wide range of activities. Some organizations use "Lazarus Group" to refer to any activity attributed to North Korea (Citation: US-CERT HIDDEN COBRA June 2017). Other organizations track specific North Korean clusters or groups, such as Bluenoroff, [APT37](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0067), and [APT38](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082), separately (Citation: Kaspersky Lazarus Under The Hood Blog 2017).
