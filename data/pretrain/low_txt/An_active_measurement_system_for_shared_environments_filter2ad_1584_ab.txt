To accurately reflect network delays, it is crucial to minimize operating-system-induced delays. Probes should be dispatched in accordance with the intended process—whether periodic or following a geometric distribution—to limit measurement bias. Since timestamps are generated by a single host, there is no need for time synchronization.

Packet pair spacings must adhere as closely as possible to the intended spacing during transmission, and the measured spacings at the receiver should accurately reflect the packet pair's actual spacing. Inferences are often based on small perturbations in spacings, typically in the range of tens or hundreds of microseconds. Therefore, measurement accuracy is critical for overall algorithmic accuracy (e.g., see [41]). Timestamps applied to packets should precisely reflect the actual spacing of packets upon sending and receipt. The intended probe process must be followed accurately to minimize measurement bias.

For BADABING, a high degree of accuracy in the probe emission process is essential. Probe pairs are sent at consecutive discrete time slots, with a default interval of 5 milliseconds. BADABING also measures one-way delay to infer congestion along a path. However, in this study, we disable this inference capability, relying solely on actual packet loss.

The measurements obtained using BADABING probes were confined to the hosts themselves and were entirely spurious from a network measurement perspective. These results pose a significant problem not only for network inference algorithms but also for any experiments deployed on shared testbeds that may be sensitive to loss, such as throughput experiments for different applications or transport protocols.

For packet pair measurements, we focus on two types of errors: initial spacing errors and timestamping errors. Initial packet pair spacings are typically on the order of tens or hundreds of microseconds (e.g., the spacing of back-to-back 1500-byte packets on Fast Ethernet is about 120 microseconds). In software, these fine timescale spacings are generally achieved through busy-waiting between system calls to emit packets, as most commodity operating system timer functions cannot deliver the required accuracy.

Shaded blocks represent time periods during which all probes suffered at least one packet loss (i.e., of the three packets in a BADABING probe, at most two were successfully transmitted).

We found that errors in initial spacings are consistent with the results from [41], indicating that while variability can be introduced due to system load and the operating system scheduler, the mean error is close to zero when considering a few loss periods.
