### Apache Airflow Version
2.4.2

### Issue Description
After upgrading from version 2.4.1 to 2.4.2, we observed that every task log line is duplicated in CloudWatch. A comparison of logs before and after the upgrade indicates that the issue is not with how the logs are displayed in the Airflow UI, but rather that the system now generates two log lines instead of one.

Both the CloudWatch log streams and the Airflow UI show duplicate log lines for most entries post-upgrade, while pre-upgrade tasks display single log lines. This duplication occurs for both tasks run using `EcsRunTaskOperator` and `PythonOperator`.

### Expected Behavior
A single, non-duplicate log line should be produced in CloudWatch.

### Steps to Reproduce
Based on our current understanding, any setup using CloudWatch remote logging with Airflow version 2.4.2 will produce duplicate log lines. However, this has not been confirmed with other setups.

### Operating System
Docker: `apache/airflow:2.4.2-python3.9` - Running on AWS ECS Fargate

### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers
- `apache-airflow[celery,postgres,apache.hive,jdbc,mysql,ssh,amazon,google,google_auth]==2.4.2`
- `apache-airflow-providers-amazon==6.0.0`

### Deployment
Other Docker-based deployment

### Deployment Details
We are running a Docker container inside AWS Fargate ECS. The following environment variables and configuration in CloudFormation control remote logging:

```yaml
- Name: AIRFLOW__LOGGING__REMOTE_LOGGING
  Value: True
- Name: AIRFLOW__LOGGING__REMOTE_BASE_LOG_FOLDER
  Value: !Sub "cloudwatch://${TasksLogGroup.Arn}"
```

### Additional Information
No other configurations were changed during the upgrade; we only updated the provider list and Docker image from 2.4.1 to 2.4.2.
