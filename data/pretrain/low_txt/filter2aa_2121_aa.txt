## Agenda
1. Why?
2. How?
3. What?
4. Show me!
5. What's next?

## Back in the Day...
### How to Create Invisible User Windows
- I wasn’t lucky :(

## How About Now?

## What About Attackers?
### Identity Manipulation
- Account Manipulation
- Valid accounts
- 19 persistence techniques
- 63 of the 85 unique procedures for persistence leverage Identity Manipulation

### External Implants
- BITS Jobs
- Hijack Execution Flow
- Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
- Implant Internal Image
- Boot or Initialization Scripts
- Modify Authentication Process
- Browser Extensions
- Office Application Startup
- Compromise Client Software Binary
- Pre-OS Boot
- Create or Modify System Process
- Scheduled Task/Job
- Event Triggered Execution
- Server Software Components
- External Remote Services
- Traffic Signaling

## The Suborner Way
Suborner is a new persistence attack that stealthily forges custom invisible accounts, which can impersonate any identity on all Windows NT machines.
- Only the creator of the suborner account will easily know the username and password.
- After authentication, the suborner account will impersonate any existing (enabled/disabled) account.

## Bribing Windows

## Getting Access

## Wait a Minute!

### Before...
- Attacker
- Admin
- Victim

## Account Creation Scenarios
1. **Scenario 1: Add user**
   - Result: FAIL! (Detected by 4720 event)
2. **Scenario 2: Add user with $**
   - Result: FAIL! (Detected by 4720 event)
3. **Scenario 3: Add machine account (netapi32)**
   - Result: DETECTED (Event 4741)

### What is Wrong?
- The baddie account is detected:
  - When created (Windows Events, API Call Sequence Analysis)
  - After its creation (User Management Applications)
  - Needs to be added to an administrative group (e.g., Administrators)
  - The Win32 API impedes modifying all account attributes freely

### What Can We Do?
- Bribe it!

## Idea
- Write the SAM directly
- No log!

## Suborning? How?
- Dynamically crafts a suborner account without calling the Win32 API functions designed to do so (e.g., netapi32::netuseradd).
- Adds extra stealth to the suborner by appending the dollar sign to its username ($).
- Configures the account as a machine account through its Account Control Bits (ACB).

## Goals
- Understand authentication/authorization for local accounts.
- Create a local account by writing directly to the SAM.
- Make it invisible!

## Authentication
- SAM
- Security Log
- LSASS
- Event Logger
- LSA Policy
- Credential Management
- NetUserAdd API

## System Architecture
- Executive
- User mode
- Kernel mode
- Security Reference Monitor (SRM)
- ALPC
- Event Logger
- LSA Service (lsasrv.dll)
- SAM Service (samsrv.dll)
- Local Security Subsystem (LSASS)
- MSV1_0.dll
- Kerberos.dll
- LSA Policy
- AD Services (ntdsa.dll, AD DB, KDC, kdcsvc.dll)
- RPC
- Credential Management
- WINLOGON
- netapi32.dll
- userenv.dll
- Others
