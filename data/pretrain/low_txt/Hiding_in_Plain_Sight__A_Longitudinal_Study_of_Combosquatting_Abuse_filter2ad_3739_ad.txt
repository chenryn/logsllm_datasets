### Types of Phishing Attacks

After visiting certain domains, such as `http://viewcustomer[.]com/s3/p10/index-20up-p10-cnf-t1-p4.php?tracker=wait.loading-links.com&keyword=staples1[...]`, users are often redirected to a landing page. In this case, the landing page presented a survey for Staples, promising a gift upon completion. However, this survey was not related to the official Staples business and was clearly designed to collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from users and potentially subscribe them to paid services.

### 6. Discussion

In Sections 2 through 5, we explored the motivations behind combosquatting domains, their differences from other types of domain squatting, and quantified their current level of abuse. Specifically, we found that combosquatting, despite its relative obscurity, is more prevalent than typosquatting (Section 4.1). Additionally, we observed that combosquatters carefully craft their domain names to align with the businesses associated with the abused trademarks (Section 4.2). By cross-referencing our list of combosquatting domains with popular blacklists, we noted that most domains remain active for several months before being flagged (Section 4.3), indicating potential blind spots in the security tools used by the industry. We also identified a few Autonomous Systems (ASes) responsible for the long-term hosting of malicious combosquatting domains (Section 4.4) and observed how both common botnets and targeted Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) use these domains to benefit from trademark recognition and remain hidden (Section 4.4). Finally, by actively crawling 1.3 million combosquatting domains and labeling the results, we discovered live phishing domains and trademark abuse across all studied business categories (Section 5.1).

Given the magnitude of the combosquatting problem, in this section, we discuss potential countermeasures from the perspective of different actors in the domain name ecosystem.

#### Registrants
A common defense against traditional domain squatting is defensive registration, where companies proactively register domains likely to be abused (e.g., Microsoft owns `wwwmicrosoft[.]com` which redirects to `microsoft[.]com`). However, combosquatting lacks a generative model, making it difficult for even well-resourced companies to generate a comprehensive list of potential combosquatting domains. Therefore, the burden of protecting against combosquatting cannot solely rest on registrants.

It is crucial for trademark owners to stop using benign combosquatting domains for their business. For example, the domain `paypal-prepaid[.]com` belongs to PayPal and advertises the ability to use PayPal for prepaid debit cards. By using such domains, companies inadvertently train users to trust domains containing their trademark, making it harder for everyday users to detect malicious ones (which, as discussed in Section 4.1, often have valid TLS certificates). Instead, trademark owners can use filepaths (e.g., `www.paypal[.]com/prepaid`), subdomains (e.g., `prepaid.paypal[.]com`), or even Top-Level Domains (TLDs) (e.g., `prepaid[.]paypal`) to advertise their products without the risks associated with combosquatting domains.

#### Registrars
Registrars have a unique position to know which domains users are attempting to register before they are actually registered. Therefore, we suggest that registrars add extra logic to their fraud-detection systems to flag domains containing popular trademarks. For each flagged domain, the registrar can request additional information from the user or follow up to ensure the domain is not used for malicious purposes. While some registrars may choose not to implement such countermeasures, over time, these registrars and the domains registered through them could be labeled as "suspicious" by domain-intelligence systems. This unwanted label will lead to a loss of income, forcing registrars to either adopt fraud-detection systems or risk further business losses.

#### Third Parties
In addition to registrars, there are various systems [18–20, 41–43] that analyze newly registered domains to discover abusive ones before they are weaponized. Similar to the extra step for registrars, we argue that searching for the presence of popular trademarks in newly registered domains can be an additional signal to identify malicious registrations.

### 7. Related Work

#### DNS Abuse
Weimer et al. [91] proposed collecting passive DNS data for security analysis. Since then, researchers have used passive DNS data to build domain name reputation systems using statistical modeling methods to detect abuse on the Internet [18–20, 25, 59, 74, 77, 92]. More recently, Lever et al. [57] used passive DNS to identify potential domain ownership changes. Hao et al. [43] used only registration features to build a domain reputation system. Liu et al. [58] revealed that dangling DNS records pointing to invalid resources can be easily manipulated for domain hijacking. Chen et al. [28] used passive DNS data to estimate the financial abuse of the advertising ecosystem by a large botnet.

#### Squatting Abuse
Several studies have focused on domain squatting in general. Jakobsson et al. [46, 47] proposed techniques for identifying typosquatting and discovered that websites in categories with higher pay-per-click (PPC) ad prices face more typosquatting registrations. Wang et al. [90] proposed models for generating typosquatting domains from authoritative ones. Agten et al. [13] studied typosquatting using crawled data over a period of seven months, finding that few trademark owners protect themselves by defensively registering typosquatting domains. In addition to typosquatting, Nikiforakis et al. [70] quantified the extent to which attackers leverage bitsquatting, where random bit-errors in commodity hardware can redirect Internet traffic to attacker-controlled domains. Their experiments show that new bitsquatting domains are registered daily and monetized through ads, affiliate programs, and malware installations. The authors later performed a measurement of "soundsquatting," where attackers abuse homophones to attract users and confuse text-to-speech systems [69].

The only work on combosquatting other than this paper is a brief 2008 industry whitepaper [1]. Starting with 30 trademarks and up to 50 generic keywords, the authors constructed possible combosquatting domains and attempted to get traffic data for the 500 domains that were registered. They found that most sites were filled with ads, thereby abusing the popularity of trademarks and diluting their revenue. Motivated by the findings of that nine-year-old whitepaper, we performed the experiments described in this paper, finding millions of combosquatting domains and analyzing registration and abuse trends over almost six years.

### 8. Conclusion

In this paper, we study a type of domain squatting termed "combosquatting," which has yet to be extensively studied by the security community. By registering domains that include popular trademarks (e.g., `paypal-members[.]com`), attackers can capitalize on a trademark’s recognition to perform social engineering, phishing, affiliate abuse, trademark abuse, and even targeted attacks. We conducted the first large-scale, empirical study of combosquatting using 468 billion DNS records from both active and passive DNS datasets, collected over almost six years. Lexical analysis of combosquatting domains revealed that, while there is an almost infinite pool of potential combosquatting domains, most instances add only a single token to the original domain. Furthermore, the chosen tokens were often specifically targeted to a particular business category. These results can help brands limit the potential search space for combosquatting domains. Additionally, our results show that most combosquatting domains were not remediated for extended periods—up to 1,000 days in many cases. Many instances of combosquatting abuse were seen active significantly before they were discovered by public blacklists or malware feeds. Consequently, our findings suggest that current protections do not adequately address the threat of combosquatting. This is particularly concerning because our results also show that combosquatting is becoming more prevalent year over year. Lastly, we found numerous instances of combosquatting abuse in the real world by crawling 1.3 million combosquatting domains and manually analyzing the results. Based on our findings, we discuss the role of different parties in the domain name ecosystem and how each party can help tackle the overall combosquatting problem. Ultimately, our results suggest that combosquatting is a real and growing threat, and the security community needs to develop better protections to defend against it.
