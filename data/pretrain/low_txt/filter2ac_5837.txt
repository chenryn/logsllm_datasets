**ATT&CK ID:** T1218  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** System Binary Proxy Execution

Adversaries may use system binaries to proxy the execution of malicious content, thereby bypassing process- and signature-based defenses. These binaries are often signed by Microsoft, either downloaded from official sources or natively present in the operating system. Trusted digital certificates, such as those from Microsoft, allow these binaries to execute on Windows systems that enforce digital signature validation.

Several Microsoft-signed binaries, which are included by default in Windows installations, can be leveraged to execute other files or commands. This technique exploits the trust placed in these signed binaries to evade detection and carry out malicious activities.
