### Key:
- **Fail**: Major problems
- **Warn**: Some problems
- **Pass**: With caveats

## 6. Conclusion

Our analysis reveals significant security and privacy issues in popular smart scale solutions. Vendors should adhere to established security standards, such as those defined by OWASP, CERT, or other organizations, even for consumer-targeted devices. Flawed pairing processes and insecure software development practices lead to vulnerable products that allow attackers to easily eavesdrop on communications.

In future work, we plan to create summaries of our findings to help consumers and healthcare providers make informed decisions when purchasing or using data from these products. We also intend to engage with manufacturers to discuss our findings and encourage improvements.
