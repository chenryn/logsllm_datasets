## Abstract
The 5th ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense (MTD 2018), held in Toronto, Canada on October 15, 2018, in conjunction with the 24th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2018), aims to bring together researchers from academia, government, and industry. The workshop focuses on discussing novel randomization, diversification, and dynamism techniques for enhancing the security of computer systems and networks. It also explores new metrics and analytical frameworks to assess and quantify the effectiveness of MTD techniques. Building on previous editions, MTD 2018 offers a platform to discuss the challenges and opportunities that such defenses provide. The program includes nine refereed papers and one invited keynote talk, providing participants with a vibrant and thought-provoking set of ideas and insights.

## 1. Introduction
The static nature of current computing systems makes them easy to attack and difficult to defend. Adversaries have an asymmetric advantage as they can study a system, identify vulnerabilities, and choose the optimal time and place to launch an attack. Moving Target Defense (MTD) aims to impose the same asymmetric disadvantage on attackers by making systems dynamic and thus harder to explore and predict. By constantly changing the system and its attack surface, MTD increases the uncertainty for attackers, similar to the challenges defenders face today. The ultimate goal of MTD is to measurably increase the workload for attackers, leveling the cybersecurity playing field and ultimately tilting it in favor of the defender.

MTD 2018 provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange novel ideas, findings, experiences, and lessons learned in this area.

## 2. Scope
Randomization, diversification, and dynamism can be applied to various components of a computer system or network and at different layers of its software stack. Consequently, MTD encompasses a broad spectrum of techniques, metrics, and analytical frameworks.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- System randomization
- Artificial diversity
- Cyber maneuver and agility
- Software diversity
- Dynamic network configuration
- Moving target in the cloud
- System diversification techniques
- Dynamic compilation techniques
- Adaptive defenses
- MTD strategies and planning
- Deep learning for MTD
- MTD quantification methods and models
- MTD evaluation and assessment frameworks
- Large-scale MTD (using multiple techniques)
- Moving target in software coding and API virtualization
- Autonomous technologies for MTD
- Human, social, and usability aspects of MTD
- Intelligent countermeasure selection

## 3. Workshop Objectives
The MTD workshop aims to bring together researchers from academia, government, and industry to report on the latest research efforts in moving target defense, generate productive discussions and constructive debates, and identify new and promising research directions. The 5th MTD workshop has a special focus on lessons learned from past research in MTD, and the challenges and opportunities faced by the community moving forward.

As MTD has proven to be a potential game-changer in the cybersecurity landscape, advancing the state of the art in this field is critical to securing the nation’s cyber infrastructure against a vast array of known and unknown threats.

## 4. MTD Program
The 5th MTD workshop is a one-day pre-conference event scheduled for October 15, 2018. The program features an invited keynote speaker, Prof. Radha Poovendran from the University of Washington, who will present a talk titled “Dynamic Defense against Adaptive and Persistent Adversaries.” This talk will address the design of MTD and DIFT games for modeling Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).

The program also includes nine refereed full papers, covering a broad range of topics from methods for evaluating MTD techniques to novel MTD frameworks and techniques, including those specifically designed to protect critical systems against advanced threats. The nine presentations are grouped into three sessions based on topics:
1. Evaluation of MTD Techniques
2. Novel MTD Frameworks and Techniques
3. Protection of Critical Services against Advanced Threats
