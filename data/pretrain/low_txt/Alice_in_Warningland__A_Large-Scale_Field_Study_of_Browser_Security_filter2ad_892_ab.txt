### 1. Introduction to Phishing and Legitimate Websites

In a study, participants were asked to identify 12 websites as either phishing or legitimate sites. However, Extended Validation (EV) certificates did not aid in identifying phishing sites [19]. In a follow-up study by Sobey et al., it was found that none of the 28 subjects clicked on the EV indicators, and their presence did not influence decision-making [29]. Similarly, Biddle et al. reported that participants did not understand Internet Explorer's certificate summaries [3].

In 2012, a Google Chrome engineer noted high clickthrough rates for SSL warnings on his blog [20]. Our research expands on this by providing a more accurate and detailed view of SSL clickthrough rates in Google Chrome.

### 2. Phishing Warnings

Phishing warnings in modern browsers are active, interstitial warnings, whereas in the past, they were passive indicators in toolbars. Researchers have examined the effectiveness of these warnings in preventing users from entering their credentials on phishing websites.

**Wu et al. Study:**
- **Experiment 1:** 30 participants role-played while using security toolbars with passive phishing warnings. Despite the toolbars, at least one attack fooled 20 out of 30 participants.
- **Experiment 2:** 10 participants performed tasks on PayPal and a shopping wish list website, with modal phishing warnings injected. No participants entered credentials on the PayPal site, but 4 were fooled on the wish list site. The authors did not report warning clickthrough rates [35].

**Egelman et al. Study:**
- 60 participants were subjected to simulated phishing attacks in Internet Explorer 7 and Mozilla Firefox 2.0. Participants believed they were part of a study about shopping and were asked to check their email, which contained both legitimate and spear phishing emails.
- Clickthrough rates for Mozilla Firefox’s active warning, Internet Explorer’s active warning, and Internet Explorer’s passive warning were 0%, 45%, and 90%, respectively [13].

### 3. Malware Download Warnings

Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet Explorer display non-blocking warning dialogs when users attempt to download malicious executables. A Microsoft employee stated that the clickthrough rate for Internet Explorer’s SmartScreen warning was under 5% [16]. We did not study this warning for Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox does not have this feature.

### 4. Methodology

We used telemetry features in Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome to measure clickthrough rates in situ. Telemetry is a mechanism for browser vendors to collect pseudonymous data from end users who opt in to statistics reporting.

#### 4.1 Measuring Clickthrough Rates

- **Metrics Implementation:** We implemented metrics to count the number of times a user sees, clicks through, or leaves a malware, phishing, or SSL warning.
- **Data Collection:** We recorded whether users clicked on links like “Help me understand,” “View,” or “Technical Details.”
- **Bypassing Warnings:** For multi-step warnings, we recorded the number of users who completed all steps to proceed.
- **SSL Errors:** We measured the frequency of specific SSL errors and their clickthrough rates.

#### 4.2 Measuring Time Spent on Warnings

- **Timing Measurements:** We used the Google Chrome telemetry framework to observe how much time users spent on SSL warnings.
- **Discrete Buckets:** Time was treated as a discrete, ordinal variable, with log-scaled bucket sizes for analysis.

#### 4.3 Ethics

- **Data Collection:** Data was collected from users who opted into browser telemetry programs. Users were asked to share usage data upon first run of the browser.
- **Privacy Policies:** All telemetry data is subject to strict privacy policies, and participants can opt out by changing their settings [7, 23].
- **Ethical Review:** Multiple contributors reviewed the data collection code to ensure no private data was collected.

#### 4.4 Data Collection

- **Collection Period:** Data was collected from April 28 - May 31, 2013, for Google Chrome, and May 1 - July 5, 2013, for Mozilla Firefox.
- **Sample Sizes:** We recorded millions of malware, phishing, and SSL warning impressions in both browsers.

#### 4.5 Method Limitations

- **Private Data:** Due to privacy constraints, we could not collect personal demographics or browsing habits.
- **Sampling Bias:** Our study only represents users who opt into browser telemetry programs, potentially introducing bias.
- **Overrepresentation:** Some clients may be overrepresented, but we removed a small number of overrepresented clients from the Google Chrome dataset.
- **Frames:** Initial measurements did not differentiate between top-level frames and iframes, but this was later corrected.

### 5. Clickthrough Rates

#### 5.1 Malware and Phishing Warnings

- **Clickthrough Rates:** Malware warning clickthrough rates were 7.2% and 23.2% for Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, respectively. Phishing warning clickthrough rates were 9.1% and 18.0%.
- **Temporal Variations:** Google Chrome’s malware warning clickthrough rates varied widely by date, while Mozilla Firefox’s rates remained stable.
- **Demographics:** Linux users had significantly higher clickthrough rates than Mac and Windows users.

#### 5.2 SSL Warnings

- **Clickthrough Rates:** The clickthrough rate for top-level frames was 28.7 percentage points higher than the overall clickthrough rate of 4.3%.

### Conclusion

Our study provides a detailed and accurate view of SSL, malware, and phishing warning clickthrough rates in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. The results highlight the importance of effective warning design and the need for further research to improve user security.
