### LAESP Messages and Call Recording in Wiretaps

LAESP messages, and consequently the target’s calls, are not recorded in call-content wiretaps.

#### Attack Scenario
- **Call Forwarding and Resource Exhaustion:**
  - A wiretap target can enable call forwarding on their wireline or mobile phone, redirecting calls to a high-capacity call center (e.g., an airline reservation system).
  - Using an automated tool like SIPp, the target places many concurrent calls from a subscribed Internet VoIP service to their phone, causing all calls to be redirected.
  - This forces the Telecommunications Service Provider (TSP) to delegate a separate Call Content Channel (CCC) for every VoIP call.
  - By placing 22 such VoIP calls, the target can exhaust the capacity of the T1 connection between the TSP and the Law Enforcement Agency (LEA), enabling them to use their wireline or mobile phone to place unmonitored calls.

These attack scenarios highlight the architectural weaknesses in current-generation CALEA wiretap systems, but they are not exhaustive of all possible countermeasures.

### Stopgap Mitigation Practices

In this section, we describe stopgap mitigations for several of the described vulnerabilities. These recommendations and best practices are intended for use with currently deployed CALEA equipment. However, because many vulnerabilities arise from the architectural design of J-standard-based implementations, these recommendations aim to mitigate some (but not all) of the described attacks and do not necessarily result in a system impervious to manipulation.

- **Provision CDC and CCC Resources According to Signaling Capabilities:**
  - The LEA and TSP should ensure that bandwidth and other resources are properly allocated for the Call Data Channel (CDC) and CCC to prevent exhaustion attacks.
  - Bandwidth requirements should be derived from the subject’s maximum possible signaling rate, rather than estimated average-case signaling rates.
  - This worst-case analysis should also be performed on internal links connecting Intercept Access Points (IAPs) to the Delivery Function (DF).

- **Do Not Trust Third-Party Signaling Interpretations:**
  - The wiretap system should not rely on the accuracy of third-party data interpretations. For example, the decoding of post cut-through DTMF tones is subject to manipulation and should not be considered accurate.

- **Disable In-Band Signaling Features:**
  - In-band signaling (e.g., the use of C-tones to convey hook status) allows the subject to control the behavior of recording equipment.
  - In-band signaling should not be used between IAPs and the DF or between the TSP and the LEA.

- **Provision Each Wiretap with Its Own CDC:**
  - A CDC should not carry call-identifying information from multiple wiretap orders, preventing the manipulation of one wiretap from causing denial-of-service to another.

- **Clearly Demarcate Inbound and Outbound Messages in a CCC:**
  - CCCs should always capture directionality. If a combined CCC is used, the directionality bit for packet data should be turned on.

- **Reconcile Pen Register Information with Other Forms of Evidence:**
  - LEAs should examine billing records and other forms of evidence to reconcile pen register information. Although such data may not be available in real-time, the transmission of stored call records is not susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks.

### Limitations of Current CALEA Systems

While several of the vulnerabilities described can be mitigated using the above stopgap procedures, there are inherent design characteristics of CALEA systems that make them susceptible to manipulation. For instance:

- Combining data from multiple IAPs into a single CDC.
- Sending SMS and IP payloads via the CDC.
- Requiring a separate CCC for each call leg.

These design features are intrinsic to CALEA systems based on the J-standard, leading to vulnerabilities that cannot easily be addressed by modifying the configurations of wiretap systems. Additionally, while many resource exhaustion attacks could be mitigated by modifying TSP equipment, these attacks rarely impact the operational stability of the TSP, reducing the motivation for TSPs to implement rate limiting.

### Conclusion

This paper presents the first security analysis of the J-standard, the architecture used for most law enforcement wiretaps in the United States. Our results demonstrate that modern services, especially wireless platforms, render these systems vulnerable to denial-of-service and other attacks. Unlike traditional eavesdropping countermeasures, these attacks can be executed unilaterally by a wiretap subject, are difficult to detect by law enforcement, and prevent the accurate collection of both content and metadata.

The J-standard appears to have been engineered based on outdated assumptions about communications platforms and has been "patched" several times to accommodate a changing environment. The presence of vulnerabilities in the architecture is unsurprising, but the scope and severity of these vulnerabilities are both surprising and disturbing. It is particularly concerning that the CALEA standards fail to consider any attack model in which a motivated target deliberately attempts to evade the wiretap.
