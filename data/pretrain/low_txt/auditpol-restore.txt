**Applies to:**

- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `auditpol /restore` command restores system audit policy settings, per-user audit policy settings for all users, and all auditing options from a file. The file must be in the comma-separated value (CSV) format used by the `/backup` option.

**Permissions:**
To perform restore operations on the per-user and system policies, you must have either Write or Full Control permissions for the relevant objects in the security descriptor. Alternatively, you can perform restore operations if you have the "Manage auditing and security log" (SeSecurityPrivilege) user right. This is particularly useful for restoring the security descriptor in the event of an error or malicious attack.

**Syntax:**
```sh
auditpol /restore /file:<path_to_file>
```

**Parameters:**

- **/file:** Specifies the path to the CSV file from which the audit policy should be restored. The file must have been created using the `/backup` option or must be syntactically consistent with the CSV file format used by the `/backup` option.
- **/? :** Displays help information at the command prompt.

**Examples:**

To restore system audit policy settings, per-user audit policy settings for all users, and all auditing options from a file named `auditpolicy.csv` that was created using the `/backup` command, type:
```sh
auditpol /restore /file:c:\auditpolicy.csv
```

This command will restore the audit policies from the specified file, ensuring that all settings are correctly applied.
