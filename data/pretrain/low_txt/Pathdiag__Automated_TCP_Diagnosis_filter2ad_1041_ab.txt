# Pathdiag: Automated TCP Diagnosis

## 3. Results and Analysis

### 3.1 Plots of Scan Results

The results in the generated report are organized hierarchically. The base of the report displays test parameters and conditions. Test results are grouped into the following categories: local host (client) configuration, path measurements, and tester (server) consistency checks. Path measurements are further subdivided into data rate, loss rate, network buffering, duplex mismatch tests, and suggestions for alternate test parameters.

- **RTT vs. Window Size (Figure 3c):** 
  - RTT was essentially constant at small window sizes.
  - Above a window of 30, each additional packet in TCP’s window was added to a standing queue at the bottleneck, causing the RTT to increase linearly with window size.

- **Power vs. Window Size (Figure 3d):**
  - Power reached a maximum at the point where the bottleneck transitioned from under-full (the link had idle time) to over-full (there was standing data in the queue).
  - This is considered the ideal TCP operating point.

### 3.2 Report Structure and Color Coding

- **Test Results Labeling:**
  - Failing tests (red) include a "corrective action" (starting with “>”) indicating what needs to be fixed and how to fix it.
  - Passing tests (green) indicate any caveats about limitations of the tests.
  - Inconclusive tests yield orange warning messages.
  - Informational messages in black are of most value to expert users.

- **Analysis Engine:**
  - Can detect 21 different failure conditions and 16 possible warnings.

### 3.3 Sample Report

#### Test Conditions
- **Tester:** (none) (192.88.115.171)
- **Target:** (none) (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
- **Logfile Base Name:** xxxxx.xxxx.xxx:xxxx-xx-xx-xx:xx:xx
- **Target Application Data Rate:** 90 Mb/s
- **Round-Trip-Time (RTT) to Target Application:** 20 ms
- **Round Trip Time for Path Section:** 2.518223 ms
- **Maximum Segment Size for Path Section:** 1448 Bytes

#### Host Configuration Tests
- **TCP Configuration Test:** Fail!
  - **Warning:** TCP connection is not using SACK.
  - **Critical Failure:** Received window scale is 2, should be 3.
  - **Diagnosis:** The target (client) is not properly configured.
  - **Corrective Action:** See TCP tuning instructions at [http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/tcptune/](http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/tcptune/)

#### Path Measurements
- **Data Rate Test:** Pass!
  - Maximum data rate was 93.900110 Mb/s.
- **Loss Rate Test:** Pass!
  - Measured loss rate 0.000848% (117889 packets between loss events).
  - FYI: To get 90 Mb/s with a 1448 byte MSS on a 20 ms path, the total end-to-end loss budget is 0.002029% (49275 packets between losses).

#### Suggestions for Alternate Tests
- **Strenuous Application Tests:**
  - Try rate=90 Mb/s, rtt=30 ms
  - Try rate=93 Mb/s, rtt=29 ms
- **MTU Adjustments:**
  - Try rate=90 Mb/s, rtt=192 ms, mtu=9000 bytes
  - Try rate=93 Mb/s, rtt=184 ms, mtu=9000 bytes

#### Network Buffering Test
- **Result:** Warning!
  - This test did not complete due to other problems with the path, target, or tester.
  - Corrective Action: Correct other problems first, and then rerun this test.
  - Estimated queue size is at least: Pkts: 64, Bytes: 92672
  - This corresponds to a 7.737751 ms drain time.
  - To get 90 Mb/s on a 20 ms path, you need 225000 bytes of buffer space.

#### Tester Validation
- **Result:** Pass!
  - No internal tester problems were detected.
  - Tester version: $Id: xxxxx.xxxx.xxx:xxxx-xx-xx-xx:xx:xx.html,v 1.1 2007/08/06 18:40:24 mathis Exp $

### 3.4 Host Configuration and Path Measurements

- **Host Configuration Tests:**
  - Confirm that TCP settings on the client are appropriate for target parameters.
  - Check options negotiated on the SYN and SYN-ACK.
  - Ensure the Window Scale option is appropriately set.
  - Verify if TCP Selective Acknowledgments (SACK) or TCP Timestamps are enabled.
  - Key test: Whether the TCP receive buffer is larger than the target window.

- **Path Measurements:**
  - Test three parameters: maximum data rate, background loss rate, and bottleneck queue size.
  - Special-case test for Ethernet duplex mismatch.
  - Data rate test fails only if the path is not short enough, the user is mistaken about the properties, or there is a serious problem.
  - Background loss rate measured at a window slightly smaller than the window necessary to cause congestion.
  - Warning issued if the measured bottleneck queue buffer space is less than the bandwidth-delay product of the target path.

### 3.5 Tester Consistency Checks

- **Purpose:** Detect if the traffic generator or pathdiag itself is a bottleneck.
- **Checks:** Unanticipated users on the server, exceptional events, and reports them as problems with the tester.

### 3.6 Server Framework

- **Report Generation:**
  - Reports are ordinary web pages, bookmarkable and shareable via URL.
  - On-line documentation emphasizes this feature.
  - Web archival of pathdiag reports is critical for ongoing improvement.
  - Periodic scans and retrieval of reports and raw data for analysis and refinement.
  - Archive holds more than 7000 diagnostic reports.
  - User privacy: Only the name and IP address of the client machine are exposed.

### 3.7 Strengths and Weaknesses

- **Strengths:**
  - Compensates for symptom scaling, making it effective for short paths and near-edge flaws.
  - Active measurement to measure loss rate at the scale of the target application.
  - Suitable for high-performance networks and non-expert users.

- **Weaknesses:**
  - Relies on active measurement and must send significant bulk data.
  - Assumes relatively unvarying cross-traffic; highly variable levels can yield inconsistent results.
  - Unidirectional diagnostic TCP stream, making it difficult to instrument from the receiving end.
  - Cannot diagnose application problems directly.

### 3.8 Closing

- **Objective:**
  - Improve TCP performance for research and education networks.
  - Well-suited for testing at the edges of the network.
  - Deployment is straightforward, with a single well-connected test server providing coverage for an entire campus or metropolitan network.
