### Upgrades

- **Strategic Plan Development and Implementation:**
  - Develop, document, and implement a comprehensive strategic plan that builds on the TICP New Hampshire Statewide Interoperability Expansion Project. This plan should cover technical, policy, operational, and funding aspects.
  - Integrate a regional interoperability funding strategy into the strategic plan. Consider diverse funding models (beyond grants) to leverage local, regional, and statewide strategic planning efforts.

### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation

- **Current Status:**
  - Concord has utilized the TICP process to formalize and expand previously informal interoperability procedures. SOPs have been disseminated, but further steps are needed to ensure their adoption across all included agencies.
  - The area implemented the National Incident Management System (NIMS) over a year ago as part of the statewide certification process. During the TICP exercise, evaluators praised the area for its exceptional communication among Unified Commanders.
  - The Communications Unit and Communications Unit Leader (COML) roles have been introduced into the area’s response structure, but some gaps in the use of the COML position were noted during the exercise.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Ensure all regional interoperability SOPs are integrated into the TICP and put into practice to enhance proficiency.
  - Disseminate the TICP to all participating agencies.
  - Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs, including the implementation of the Communications Unit consistent with the TICP, to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

### Usage: Established Implementation

- **Current Status:**
  - Concord regularly provides interoperable communication through VHF systems. The state has also implemented gateways and two radio caches through the Statewide Infrastructure Interoperability Project.
  - During the TICP validation exercise, the deployment of the radio cache was well-received by evaluators. However, coverage issues were encountered with shared channels, leading to unclear communications with the dispatch center.
  - The National Guard was actively involved in the TICP planning and exercise.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional interoperability resources to improve proficiency, including federal agencies.
  - Incorporate communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

### Technology Overview

- **Existing Technology:**
  - The City of Concord maintains several radio systems, including a predominantly simplex mode VHF high band analog system for Concord Fire, Concord Police, and Bow Police.
  - They also use a UHF repeater for fire alarms and administrative functions, and UHF links for transmitter sites. Concord Police now operate on a P25-compliant VHF high band digital radio system.
  - Merrimack County uses a VHF dual-mode digital/analog system and provides dispatch services for 10 communities around Concord.
  - The State’s Radio Interoperability Frequency Subcommittee has established a standard VHF radio programming template, providing statewide interoperability.
  - The area is working towards acquiring a fully P25-compliant trunked radio system. The New Hampshire Statewide Interoperability Expansion Project includes the installation of ACU-1000 audio matrix switches at designated sites.
  - Additional VHF low band, UHF, and 700/800 MHz base stations or repeaters are required to achieve full interoperability. A shared mobile command post platform will provide movable infrastructure resources.

#### Summary
- **Governance: Early Implementation**
- **Standard Operating Procedures: Intermediate Implementation**
- **Usage: Established Implementation**

- **Designated Area:**
  - The Middle Rio Grande Planning Area, which includes Valencia, Bernalillo, and Sandoval counties, along with incorporated cities and Native American tribes and pueblos.

- **Governance: Early Implementation**
  - The Communications Committee was established in March 2006 to develop the TICP. The committee includes public safety support agencies and state and federal agencies.
  - While the TICP has published and active agreements, they are not yet fully implemented. There is no interoperability strategic plan, and budgets are managed independently.
  - Funding primarily comes from grants, and there is no long-term funding plan. Local leadership has not demonstrated strong fiscal or political support for interoperable communications.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Involve all relevant local, state, federal, and tribal agencies in the decision-making group and define roles and responsibilities.
  - Support the decision-making group through regular meetings and active issue resolution.
  - Document and implement agreements (e.g., MOUs, mutual aid agreements) among all participating agencies.
  - Develop and implement a strategic plan beyond the TICP, aligning local and statewide efforts.
  - Incorporate a regional interoperability funding strategy into the strategic plan.
  - Identify a champion to promote continued interoperability progress.
  - Consider direct involvement of a high-level official with political and fiscal authority.

- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Intermediate Implementation**
  - The TICP represents the area’s first multijurisdictional, multidiscipline interoperable communications SOPs.
  - Participation from all jurisdictions is not clear, and dissemination of SOPs is uncertain. NIMS/ICS was recently implemented, and participants demonstrated proficiency with command and control.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Encourage full participation of all first responders.
  - Continue to develop and disseminate SOPs within the TICP framework.
  - Provide ongoing training and exercises to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

- **Usage: Established Implementation**
  - The area operates on a shared system for daily interoperable solutions. Participants demonstrated familiarity and proficiency with the equipment during the TICP validation exercise.
  - The effective use of the radio cache, gateways, and shared channels was noted, but it is unclear if all local and tribal first responder agencies can demonstrate the same level of proficiency.

- **Recommendation:**
  - Include communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

- **Technology Overview:**
  - The area has six radio caches, shared channels, six mobile gateways, and one fixed gateway. Five shared systems include an 800 MHz system, a conventional UHF system, two conventional VHF systems, and a conventional UHF/VHF system.
