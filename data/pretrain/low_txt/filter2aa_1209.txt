## Reliable Methods to Prevent Disk Caching
- Use two HTTP headers (not meta tags):
  - **Pragma: no-cache**: Effective for Internet Explorer 8 and earlier with HTTP/1.0 servers.
  - **Cache-Control: no-store**: Applicable in all other cases.

## Common Failures in Preventing Caching
- **Cache-Control: no-cache**: Not a standard method; works in IE 4-9 but fails in IE 10.
- **Pragma: no-cache**: Only effective in Internet Explorer.
- **Cache-Control: private**: Not intended for browser use.
- **Cache-Control in meta tags**: Not recognized by any browser.
- **Cache-Control with HTTP/1.0**: Fails in IE 4-8.

## Historical Context of Disk Caching Policies
- **Never cache HTTPS**:
  - Netscape 1, 3+
  - Mozilla
  - Firefox 1, 2
  - Safari
- **Opt-in**:
  - Firefox 3, 3.5
- **Non-standard opt-out**:
  - Netscape 2
  - IE 3
- **Generous opt-out**:
  - IE 4-8
  - IE 9
  - IE 10
- **Strict standards compliance**:
  - Chrome
  - Firefox 4+

## Misunderstandings of Caching
- Google's statements:
  - "Browsers do not cache SSL"
  - "Browsers do not cache HTTPS"
- Quote from Mozilla bug 531801: 
  - "I’m on MoCo’s security team :)"
  - Among sites that don’t use `cache-control: no-store`, the correlation between “SSL” and “sensitive” is very low.

## Recommendations
- Update web standards.
- Fix web applications.
- Correct poor documentation.
- Improve browser behavior (if necessary).

## A History Lesson
- **1995**: Netscape 1 does not disk cache HTTPS content.
- **1996**:
  - Netscape 2 allows caching unless `Pragma: no-cache` header or meta tag is set.
  - IE 3 copies Netscape's opt-out behavior.
  - Netscape 3 reverts, does not cache by default.
- **1997**:
  - RFC 2068 introduces the `Cache-Control` header.
  - IE 4 supports `Cache-Control` when sent by an HTTP/1.1 server.
  - `Cache-Control: no-cache` prevents disk caching in IE.
  - `Pragma: no-cache` remains supported.
- **1998**:
  - Mozilla scraps Netscape code and begins a rewrite.
  - `Pragma: no-cache` support is lost in the rewrite.
- **2000**:
  - Netscape 6 released, does not cache.
  - `Pragma: no-cache` is lost (but no one notices).
  - Apache SSL bug workaround introduced, breaking `Cache-Control` support in IE 4-8.
- **2003**: Safari released; never caches.
- **2008**:
  - Firefox 3 is opt-in: caches only if `Cache-Control: public` is set.
  - Chrome is opt-out: caches unless `Cache-Control: no-store` is set.
  - Chrome does not support `Pragma: no-cache`.
- **2010**: Apache trunk patched; `Cache-Control` breakage now restricted to IE 4, 5.
- **2011**:
  - Firefox 4 adopts Chrome’s opt-out caching by default.
  - IE 9 accepts `Cache-Control` headers over HTTP/1.0.
- **2013**:
  - IE 10 caches despite `Cache-Control: no-cache`.
  - ISE tests 30 HTTPS sites; 21 fail to set `Cache-Control: no-store` on sensitive data.
  - IE 8 `Cache-Control` support still broken by Apache software in the latest CentOS.
