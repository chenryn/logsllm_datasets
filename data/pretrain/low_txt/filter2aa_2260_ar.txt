### Tactical Interoperable Communications (TIC) Evaluation and Recommendations

#### 1. Columbus Urban Area (UA)

**Demonstration of Proficiency:**
During the TICP validation exercise, proficiency in the Communications Unit Leader (COML) position was demonstrated, with the COML being effectively identified.

**Recommendation:**
- Continue to provide basic and advanced training and exercises on Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), including communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP, to ensure all participating first responder agencies achieve and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Advanced Implementation**
The Columbus UA has implemented an aggressive training and exercise plan for communications. Regular monthly exercises on the use of gateways have shown proficiency in each category of interoperable equipment. For example, evaluators observed the effective setup and activation of the gateway listed in the TICP. Additionally, interoperable communications were provided for regional responders, including the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office, Franklin County Emergency Management, Ohio Department of Transportation, Ohio National Guard, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.

**Recommendation:**
- Consider incorporating communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

**Technology Overview:**
Currently, two major 800 MHz Motorola SMARTNET II™ trunked analog radio systems are used by governmental agencies in Franklin County. Recent upgrades to dispatch consoles promote interoperability. The majority of public safety agencies use the City of Columbus system, while many public service agencies use the Franklin County system. These systems provide interoperability through common technology, allowing talk groups from both systems to reside on the same radio.

**Vision and Goals:**
The Columbus UA aims to coordinate interoperability in the Columbus area and incorporate other counties within Homeland Security Region 4 into the committee. To achieve this, the committee plans to:
- Establish the ability to change talk groups on any radio.
- Use the statewide Multi-Agency Radio Communications System.
- Connect disparate radio systems through a gateway device or via console patches at all dispatch centers.
- Distribute radios to other agencies to provide interoperability with local radio systems and channels.

#### 2. Toledo Urban Area (UA)

**Summary:**
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Intermediate Implementation
- **Usage:** Intermediate Implementation

**Governance:**
The Governance Board, appointed by county commissioners, focuses on the TICP, which provides communications interoperability agreements for agencies within Lucas County. A new 800 MHz Project 25 (P25) system is being implemented with strong support from local leaders. Funding is in place, and a newly passed 9-1-1 levy will support ongoing operations. Despite these efforts, the governance group has not ensured interoperability with surrounding counties, state agencies, and additional support organizations.

**Recommendations:**
- Involve state and federal organizations in the group, document their roles and responsibilities, and consider more regular participation in statewide interoperability committee efforts.
- Document and formalize agreements among all participating agencies to support partnerships on regional interoperability.
- Broaden agreements to include state, federal, and international agencies.
- Develop and implement a strategic plan, with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance.
- Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure regional interoperability needs are met.
- Enhance regional interoperability funding strategy and methods to include additional long-term funding sources.
- Leverage partnerships involved in regionwide system development to emphasize broadening aspects of interoperability.

**SOPs:**
The TICP provides the first regional communications interoperability SOPs for the Toledo UA. While these SOPs are less mature, the UA has done well in disseminating and applying them. Challenges with operating within the TICP procedures were noted during the TICP validation exercise.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to distribute SOPs throughout the UA and train all participating agencies.
- Ensure all regional interoperability SOPs are in place, in practice, and increase proficiency in their use.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage:**
The Toledo UA regularly uses shared channels and systems for day-to-day and mutual aid responses. However, some deficiencies were observed, such as issues with radio caches and console patches.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources to improve proficiency.
- Involve additional state and federal agencies in training and exercises.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

**Technology Overview:**
The City of Toledo Police and Fire and Rescue Departments use the Toledo 800 MHz trunked radio system. The Lucas County Sheriff’s Office operates on a UHF system, but many command and control personnel have access to the Toledo 800 MHz system. All other agencies within Lucas County are on various VHF and UHF systems. Agencies have access to the State of Ohio Multi-Agency Radio Communications System (MARCS) for command and control during incidents. All agencies will migrate to the Countywide 800 MHz Digital Communications System, designed to meet P25 standards, starting in June/July 2007.

#### 3. Central Oklahoma Urban Area (UA)

**Summary:**
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Intermediate Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

**Governance:**
The Central Oklahoma Urban Area Security Initiative (COUASI) Working Group, composed of 26 executive-level individuals, established the Interoperable Communications Subcommittee to create the TICP. The subcommittee includes technical communications experts but is working to expand membership. Additional local, state, and federal participation will assist in further developing interoperable communications. The UA does not have a documented and formal strategic plan for regional communications interoperability, but it demonstrates an understanding of the importance of interoperable communications and is providing fiscal and political support.

**Recommendations:**
- Expand Interoperable Communications Subcommittee membership to include rural, state, federal, and tribal agencies.
- Integrate technical and operational working groups to ensure requirements are met.
- Reference all applicable agreements in the TICP and store them in an accessible format.
- Document and formalize agreements among all participating agencies to support partnerships on regional interoperability.
- Develop and implement a regional strategic plan with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance.
- Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure regional interoperability needs are met.
- Initiate development and implementation of a regional approach to long-term interoperability planning and sustainable funding.
- Continue to involve senior government leadership on interoperability.

**SOPs:**
The SOPs included in COUASI’s TICP represent the area’s first consensus interoperable communications plan. The UA is taking steps to disseminate the newly created SOPs and has plans for conducting training on them. During the exercise, participants experienced some procedural problems with shared channels and would benefit from adding region-specific policies and procedures to the TICP.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to develop and distribute regional interoperability SOPs and put them into practice through regular training, exercise, and use.
- Schedule a regular review and update process of policies and procedures.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.
- Ensure that the best practice of having an oversight committee to monitor NIMS/ICS training remains a regional priority.

**Usage:**
COUASI frequently uses the available means of interoperable communications in day-to-day activities. During the exercise, first responders were able to establish communications with minimal problems, but broader state and federal agencies were not widely included.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional communications interoperability resources to improve proficiency.
- Include additional state and federal agencies in future exercises and day-to-day use.
- Add communications interoperability as an evaluation component for all future exercises and daily activities.

**Technology Overview:**
Each city in the UA uses a radio system for its jurisdictional police, fire, and EMS agencies, configured with interoperability channels. Cross-jurisdictional interoperability requires technology such as gateways or shared frequencies. Four gateways are available, with the 64-port Causeway Switch managed by Oklahoma City providing the greatest degree of interoperability. In the future, Oklahoma City plans to implement a crossband switch that will connect mutual aid channels. The State of Oklahoma has a 5-year plan to extend its Motorola 800 MHz trunked system along major highways.
