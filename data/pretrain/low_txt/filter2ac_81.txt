Adversaries may obtain and misuse credentials of cloud accounts to gain initial access, establish persistence, escalate privileges, or evade defenses. Cloud accounts are created and configured by organizations for various purposes, including user access, remote support, service management, and administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS (Software as a Service) application. In some cases, these cloud accounts may be federated with traditional identity management systems, such as Windows Active Directory.
