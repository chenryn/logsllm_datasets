## Background

Athena was the Greek goddess of wisdom, war, the arts, industry, justice, and skill. She was a staunch supporter of Odysseus and frequently aided both him and his son, Telemachus, throughout the *Odyssey*. The name "Athena" is also associated with a Turkish band, but that is not relevant here.

I developed Athena as an improvement over a poorly written search engine query tool I had been working on. It builds upon Foundstone’s SiteDigger, using a modified yet semi-compatible form of the SiteDigger XML file format.

---

## Requirements

Athena requires the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to be installed. It has been tested on various Windows XP systems with .NET, and it should work on Windows 2000 as well. If anyone manages to run Athena on Mono, I would be very interested in hearing about it.

## Further Information

The latest release of Athena can be found on the Athena homepage at [http://www.buyukada.co.uk/projects/athena/](http://www.buyukada.co.uk/projects/athena/). Additionally, there is an Athena mailing list accessible from the main site.

## Credit Where Credit’s Due

Athena would not have been possible without the help of several individuals. I would like to thank the team at Foundstone for their excellent SiteDigger, which almost met my requirements and inspired me to create Athena. Special thanks to jonny.ihackstuff.com and the Fravia guys at searchlore.org for their inspiration. Muad’dib and Jamaica Dave were invaluable as beta testers. Lastly, I am deeply grateful to my wife, Ozge, for her patience and support as I balanced this project with home and work responsibilities.

## Polite Notice

Athena could be misused to perform unethical actions. Please do not use it for such purposes. Each time you exploit something through Athena, it diminishes my incentive to publicly release updates. If I receive enough complaints from search engine owners, I will take Athena offline.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Installing Athena is straightforward. Simply double-click the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Once installed, you can launch Athena from the Start menu or by double-clicking the Athena icon on your desktop. You should see a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 1.

**Figure 1: Athena’s Startup Screen**

### Screen Layout
The screen is divided into three areas (refer to Figure 1):
1. **Menu (1):** Allows you to load XML configuration files, specify output files, exit, and view the about page.
2. **Query Management (2):** This is where most of the action happens. The buttons (Search, Stop, Reload, Back, Forward, and Exit) are self-explanatory. Use the "Selected Search Engine" drop-down box to choose which search engine to use. The "Query Description" text box provides a description of the selected query, and the "Current URL" box updates whenever a change affects the URL to be submitted.
3. **Browser View (3):** An embedded Internet Explorer instance managed by the values in the query management area.

By default, Athena uses google.com with no preset query types, allowing you to explore its features immediately.

## Your First Query with Athena

Using Athena is simple. Follow these steps:
1. Go to `File > Open` and open `google.xml`.
2. Athena is now set up to search using Google. In the "Selected Search Engine" drop-down box, select `Default (Google.com)`.
3. Scroll down the "Query Selection" list and select `"robots.txt" "Disallow:" filetype:txt`.
4. In the "Refine Query" box, type `site:whitehouse.gov` and click `Search`.

The query description explains that this query looks for `robots.txt` files containing disallow fields, which tell the search engine where not to look. Using `site:whitehouse.gov` restricts the search to the whitehouse.gov domain, a Google-specific extension. See Figure 2 for the results.

Next, select `Google (Pages from the UK)` from the "Selected Search Engine" drop-down box. This time, there should be no findings. Switch to `Google (TR)` and change the refine query entry to `site:.tr`, then hit `Search`.

**Note:** Do not click through to any of the sites shown in this tutorial. If you need to view them, use the Google cache.

To switch to Yahoo, open the `yahoo.xml` config in Athena. Select `Yahoo.com` from the "Selected Search Engine" drop-down box. Scroll down the query list, select `filetype:xls username password email`, and hit `Search`. Using the `site:` prefix, you can restrict searches to specific top-level domains (TLDs), domains, or subdomains.

## Logging with Athena

Logging in Athena is straightforward. Go to `File > Output Log` and choose a location to save your logs. Any requests made with the `Search` button will be logged, along with a timestamp and a blank line for notes. Logs are written until the program is closed or the log file is changed.

**Note:** Only searches using the `Search` button are logged. Clicking through the browser window or using Internet Explorer directly is not logged. If you want something to appear in the logs, use the `Search` button!

## Hints and Tips

- **Never** click through from a search result to a site without permission. Some searches may generate URLs that, if accessed, could constitute unethical hacking. At the very least, you may violate the Acceptable Use Policy of the search engine. If in doubt, do not proceed.
- If authorized, check the search engine cache as well as the actual page. Sometimes, more information can be found in a cached copy.
- Only searches using the `Search` button are logged. If you navigate to the next page of search results in the browser window, it is not logged. That's why there is a blank line after each log entry for your notes.
- Learn the syntax of the search engines you are using. Refining queries to specific targets can yield better results than broad searches.
- Experiment with the XML configurations, write your own search query items, and send them to me at PI:EMAIL!

## Athena’s Configuration Format

Athena uses an XML file (based on SiteDigger’s format for compatibility) for its configuration. It can read almost anything as long as certain tags are present; it does not need to be strictly valid XML. The configuration file has two sections: **Search Engines** and **Search**. The `searchEngineSignature` tag surrounds everything. The `searchEngine` tags define the search engines, and they include the following tags: `searchEngineName`, `searchEnginePrefix`, and `searchEnginePostfix`. These entries must be present, but their order is flexible. Here are some examples:

- **Google (UK)**
  ```xml
  <searchEngineName>Google (UK)</searchEngineName>
  <searchEnginePrefix>http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=</searchEnginePrefix>
  <searchEnginePostfix>&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&meta=</searchEnginePostfix>
  ```

- **Google (Pages from the UK)**
  ```xml
  <searchEngineName>Google (Pages from the UK)</searchEngineName>
  <searchEnginePrefix>http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=</searchEnginePrefix>
  <searchEnginePostfix>&btnG=Search&meta=cr=countryUK|countryGB</searchEnginePostfix>
  ```

## To-Do

- Code cleanup
- More search engine configurations (send yours to PI:EMAIL!)
- Implement SiteDigger XML category drop-box for quicker query fragment finding (not sure if this is a good idea).
