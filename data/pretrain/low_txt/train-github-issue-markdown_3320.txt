Subject: Native Apple FPS Support for the Plugin

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to propose an enhancement to our plugin, specifically to enable native support for Apple's FPS (Frames Per Second) functionality. I believe that integrating this feature will significantly improve the performance and compatibility of our plugin with Apple devices.

Could we please discuss the feasibility of implementing this improvement? I am eager to hear your thoughts on this matter and look forward to collaborating on this potential upgrade.

Best regards,
