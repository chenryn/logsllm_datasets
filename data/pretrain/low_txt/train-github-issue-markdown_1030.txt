## Steps to Reproduce

I have created a demo that displays 51 image widgets within a `ListView` widget. The images are sourced from a CDN server. After all the images are loaded and displayed, the application consumes over 360 MB of memory. For reference, please see the attached screenshot:

Each image is approximately 200 KB in size, well below 1 MB. The URLs for the image resources can be found in the `ImagesSource.dart.txt` file, and the Flutter project code is in the `main.dart.txt` file.

For comparison, I also developed a native iOS demo to display the same set of images. The native iOS app only uses around 70 MB of memory. Why does the Flutter application consume significantly more memory than the native iOS version?

Additionally, in my Flutter demo, when an image widget is clicked, the home page rebuilds by calling the `setState()` function. At this point, the `build()` method returns a `Text` widget instead of the `ListView` widget. I expected the memory usage to decrease, but it remains the same. I even tried forcing garbage collection (GC), but it had no effect. How does the Dart GC work in this context?
