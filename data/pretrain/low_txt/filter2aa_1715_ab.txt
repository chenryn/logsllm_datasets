# Logitech Unifying Dynamic Keepalives

### Packet Analysis
- **Keepalive Interval (110ms)**
  - `[17.294] 9D:65:CB:58:4D 0040006E52 // keepalive, 110ms interval`
  - `[17.387] 9D:65:CB:58:4D 0040006E52 // keepalive, 110ms interval`

- **ACK Payload and HID++ Version Request**
  - `[17.294] 9D:65:CB:58:4D 00104D0014000000008F // ACK payload; requesting HID++ version`
  - `[17.302] 9D:65:CB:58:4D 00514D00140405000000000000000000000000000045 // response (HID++ 4.5)`
  - `[17.302] 9D:65:CB:58:4D // ACK`

### Keepalive Mechanism
- **Purpose**: Detect poor channel conditions.
- **Channel Change**: If a keepalive is missed, the device changes channels.
- **Dynamic Interval Setting**: The mouse/keyboard sets the keepalive interval dynamically.
  - **Short Interval**: When the device is active.
  - **Long Interval**: When the device is idle.

### Example of Keepalive Intervals
- **Mouse Movement (8ms Interval)**
  - `[20.173] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:C2:00:00:01:00:00:00:00:3D // mouse movement (implicitly sets keepalive interval to 8ms)`
  - `[20.189] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:C2:00:00:01:00:00:00:00:3D`
  - `[20.196] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:C2:00:00:01:00:00:00:00:3D`
  - `[20.282] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:C2:00:00:00:E0:FF:00:00:5F`
  - `[20.289] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:C2:00:00:00:F0:FF:00:00:4F`

- **No Movement (110ms Interval)**
  - `[20.181] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:4F:00:00:6E:00:00:00:00:43 // no movement after 8ms, set keepalive interval to 110ms`
  - `[20.297] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:4F:00:00:6E:00:00:00:00:43 // no movement after 8ms, set keepalive interval to 110ms`
  - `[20.305] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:40:00:6E:52 // keepalive at 110ms interval`
  - `[25.377] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:40:00:6E:52`
  - `[25.470] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:40:00:6E:52`

- **Idle State (1200ms Interval)**
  - `[25.563] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:4F:00:04:B0:00:00:00:00:FD // after 5 seconds idle, increase keepalive interval to 1200ms`
  - `[25.571] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:40:04:B0:0C // keepalive at 1200ms interval`
  - `[26.533] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:40:04:B0:0C`
  - `[27.486] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:40:04:B0:0C`
  - `[28.439] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:40:04:B0:0C`
  - `[29.392] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:40:04:B0:0C`
  - `[30.345] 4C:29:9D:C6:09 00:40:04:B0:0C`

# Logitech Unifying Pairing Process
1. **Pairing Mode Initiation**: Unifying software instructs the dongle to enter pairing mode.
2. **Listening for Pairing Requests**: Dongle listens for pairing requests on address `BB:0A:DC:A5:75`.
3. **Timeout**: Dongle times out if pairing does not occur within 30-60 seconds.
4. **Device Information Exchange**: Device type and properties are sent during the pairing process.
