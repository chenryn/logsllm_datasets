### Analysis of IXP Peerings and Members

#### Ranking IXPs by Discovered Peerings
After associating each of the 58,000 discovered peerings (regardless of the assigned confidence) with the corresponding IXP, we rank the IXPs in descending order based on the total number of associated discovered peerings. Figure 4 illustrates this ranking, with the IXPs on the x-axis and their sizes on the y-axis, broken down by the portions of peerings to which we assigned "high," "medium," and "low" confidence, respectively.

The plot reveals that "high confidence" or "validated" peerings dominate the left-hand side of the figure, where the number of discovered peerings at an IXP is high. Conversely, many IXPs on the right-hand side have a majority of "low confidence" peerings, consistent with our earlier observation that the success or failure of discovering the peering matrices of small IXPs is highly dependent on the location of our Looking Glasses (LGs) relative to those IXPs and their members. It is important to note that the absence of ground truth regarding the total number of peerings at an IXP prevents us from indicating in Figure 4 how far off our estimates are compared to the actual number of peerings.

#### Measuring IXP Size by Number of Members
A more reliable method for measuring the size of an IXP, and one that allows for comparison with ground truth, is to use the number of members. We take as ground truth the member lists obtained from IXP websites (when available) or from PeeringDB and PCH, yielding a total of 4,000 member ASes. We then infer the number of members of an IXP via the discovered peerings associated with that IXP. This results in a natural classification of IXP members into "high," "medium," and "low" confidence members, depending on the confidence level assigned to the discovered peering links between the ASes involved in the discovered peerings at that IXP.

For example, if IXP X is known to have three members (AS1, AS2, and AS3), and if we discover the peerings AS1-AS2 and AS2-AS3 with any of the three confidence levels, we conclude that AS1, AS2, and AS3 are all members at IXP X, regardless of what we know about the relationship between AS2 and AS3. The members will be classified as "high," "medium," or "low" confidence based on the highest confidence attribute assigned to the corresponding peerings.

Figure 5 shows the 223 IXPs ranked in descending order of the total number of members (based on the ground truth). The plot depicts the portions of members classified as "high," "medium," and "low" confidence members and also shows the fraction of members of each IXP that were not discovered by our method. Our method performs well for large IXPs, where the difference between the ground truth and the discovered members is typically small, and the confidence assigned to the discovered members is generally high. An exception is Interlan IX (at x=48), for which we could not validate any member.

#### Member Presence and Connectivity
Figure 6 ranks the 4,000 member ASes in descending order of their presence across multiple IXPs, broken down by the level of confidence we have in the discovered membership. Among the top networks, we find two content providers: Google (present in 35 IXPs) and Limelight Networks (present in 29 IXPs). PCH tops all networks with its presence in 39 IXPs. Note that if an organization uses different ASNs to peer at IXPs, each ASN will be plotted separately on the x-axis. For example, ISC is present as AS3557 in 42 different IXPs, but in our datasets, ISC appears with ASN 3557 at only 4 IXPs and with 18 other ASNs at other IXPs. This deficiency could be addressed by grouping ASes that are part of the same organization, but we currently lack a principled method for such grouping.

Figure 7 ranks the 4,000 member ASes by the number of discovered IXP-related peerings established by each member AS, broken down by the level of confidence we assigned to the discovered peerings. Among the networks that peer most aggressively at the IXPs, we encountered PCH, several Tier-2 ISPs, and Limelight Networks with 500 peerings. Google appears in this analysis with 151 peerings (at a total of 35 IXPs).

Figure 8 shows the member multi-connectivity, where a network may have multiple peering sessions with the same member AS at multiple IXPs. For each AS pair, we count the total number of discovered peerings, rank the pairs by their member multi-connectivity, and show a plot broken down by the level of confidence assigned to the discovered peerings. Among the top AS pairs are Google and Limelight, who peer with one another at 16 different IXPs. The peering at x=15, for which we have only low confidence information, corresponds to links between Cogent (AS174) and AT&T (AS7018).

### Conclusion
We have attempted to map all IXPs using the most complete input data, various databases (IXP databases, websites, IRR), and by looking for IXPs in all known publicly available datasets produced and used by Internet topology researchers (CAIDA, DIMES, PlanetLab). We propose new methods to build additional datasets (targeted traceroutes, source routing, BGP tables). We detect 223 IXPs out of 278 and show that most of the remaining undetected IXPs are inactive or not visible to tracerouting. We also discover significantly more IXP-related peerings than previous studies and show that these peerings are not present in currently-used AS maps of the Internet.

For future work, running our tools regularly will help us understand the evolution of IXPs. New members are added regularly, and large IXPs claim to have witnessed exponential growth in recent years. Fine-tuning our techniques to eliminate the number of low and medium confidence peerings and focusing on the remaining "islands" in the IXP substrate of the AS-level Internet that have remained largely invisible to our method will bring our IXP mapping effort to a successful conclusion. Such fine-tuning will also require the development of a principled approach for identifying and dealing with ASes that use multiple ASNs. Deriving the traffic matrices of IXPs on top of the peering matrices (the main focus of this paper) remains an important but challenging open problem. Large IXPs typically report a total volume of traffic on the order of Gbps, and the use of state-of-the-art tools for bandwidth measurement might help shed light on this important part of the Internet traffic.
