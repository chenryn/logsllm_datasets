### Complementarity and the New Approach to Public Development Programs

The new approach highlights the complementarity between various elements, questioning the traditional posture of public authorities and the conventional methods of conducting public development programs. In the context of development through micro-projects, as observed in the experiments with two schools, the role of public authorities evolves from a top-down initiator of urban development to an open governance model. This open governance model aligns with the principles of open government, where citizens have access to data and proceedings related to public actions, and open-source governance, which encourages citizen involvement in policy-making for a more democratic process.

Beyond transparency and accessibility, this form of open governance emphasizes continuous action-research, focusing less on decision-making and more on facilitating stakeholder participation. It also redefines the roles and postures of public authorities, introducing scenarios based on a mosaic of micro-visions that start from the users' perspective. This generates a collective projection of the territory that is fundamentally different from the programmatic approach, which typically begins with the creation of urban infrastructures to foster new ways of living.

### Two Key Notions: Shifting Meanings and Supporting Micro-Projects

1. **Shifting Meanings and Giving Visibility to Bottom-Up Initiatives**
   - In both experiments, students from the two design schools began by identifying local potentialities and mapping social initiatives and bottom-up innovations. They brought to light small-scale phenomena that are often overlooked or considered niche developments.
   - This process has two dimensions: first, it gives voice and publicity to actions that might otherwise go unnoticed due to their size or eccentric nature. Second, and more importantly, it changes the meaning of these actions, acting as interpreters who present them in a new light. Difficulties are reframed as solutions, and localized ideas are seen as general opportunities for sustainable and inclusive living.
   - Examples include the concepts of a diffused campus in Saint-Gilles and the Paris-Saclay campus as a region-wide living lab, which shift the focus from potential conflicts (e.g., between local populations and incoming students) to more positive perspectives (e.g., intergenerational dynamics and experimental neighborhoods).

2. **Supporting Posture for Micro-Projects**
   - Traditionally, public authorities in France and Belgium have seen themselves as initiators of local development and territorial transformation, with citizens as passive beneficiaries of public services. Recent trends toward participative governance have begun to change this dynamic.
   - The experiments conducted by the schools demonstrate a further step in an intrinsically bottom-up construction of the territory through the assembly of meaningful micro-projects. Public authorities should adopt an enabling or supportive posture, providing the necessary conditions and environment for the development of social innovations.
   - This involves administrative and legislative flexibility, measured forms of subsidies, technical assistance, and support for continuous assessment and reorientation. Urban planners and designers play key roles as enablers, interpreters, and amplifiers in this process.

### Development Agency Labs

The first experiment between Paris-Saclay and ENSCI Paris DESIS Lab will further explore how user-centered design can transform territorial planning. This includes organizing immersion sessions for students from various disciplines at the EPPS development agency to co-develop new integrated methods based on previous experiences.

One scenario developed by the students proposes a vision for an urban and economic development agency as a public innovation place, shifting from consultation to co-creation through the generation of DEVELOPMENT AGENCYlabs. These labs would prioritize social architecture and then channel the appropriate urban infrastructure. For example, the first Learning Center around the Politecnique metro station sparked interest in creating more such experimental third places, leading to projects like 'La Villette-Saclay' and other innovative spaces.

### Implications for Design Practice, Education, and Policy

**Design Practice:**
- Intensify in-depth and long-term immersions into the social fabric of territories.
- Promote co-creation as a means to enable and support innovation by the population and stakeholders.
- Generate forward-looking activities based on the aggregation of multiple micro-projects.
- Support deliberation and public participation with explicit representations of future visions.

**Design Education:**
- Explore the value of design approaches and tools for territorial development and local policy-making.
- Consider interdisciplinary experiences (e.g., between design, urban planning, and policy-making) to enhance design education.
- Question the role of physical school locations compared to immersive, in-vivo education.

**Design Policy:**
- Map and give visibility to local potentials and micro-informal initiatives.
- Ensure that these potentials are developed into tangible, meaningful visions for the population.
- Consider these visions in stakeholder debates for their innovation capabilities.
- Develop the capability of public authorities to support local, bottom-up initiatives and provide the appropriate environment for self-territorial development.
