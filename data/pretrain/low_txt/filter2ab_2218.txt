**ATT&CK Technique Name:** CMSTP

Adversaries may exploit the Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP.exe) to execute malicious code. CMSTP.exe is a command-line utility designed to install Connection Manager service profiles, which are used for remote access connections. This tool accepts an installation information file (INF) as a parameter. By providing a specially crafted INF file, adversaries can leverage CMSTP.exe to proxy the execution of malicious payloads, thereby bypassing certain security controls and executing arbitrary code on the target system.
