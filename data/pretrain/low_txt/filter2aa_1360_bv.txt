### Free Service for Identifying Email Addresses Associated with Online Scams

This free service allows you to query an email address to determine if it is associated with any reported online scams. The standard search box supports exact searches, but you can also perform wildcard searches via the URL. For example, you can use this method to find all ProtonMail email addresses in the scam database.

#### Caution and Considerations

I am somewhat hesitant to recommend this resource because it seems too good to be true. This "people data" collection company offers 1,000 free queries of their premium datasets to anyone, and they accept masked email addresses such as those from 33mail, Anonaddy, and Simple Login. Similar companies like Full Contact and Pipl have offered similar deals only to later convert to a paid model without any trial period. People Data Labs may be planning a similar marketing strategy, but we should take advantage of the resource while it is available.

To use this service, you must create a free trial account on their website under the "Get API Key" option. This will provide you with a unique key for your usage, which can be found in the "Dashboard" section of the page. 

### DomainBigData (domainbigdata.com)

- **Full Name & Mailing Address**
- **Telephone Number**
- **Eight Owned Domain Names**
- **Registrar and Host Details**

For example, a query might reveal that "PI:EMAIL" is associated with a scammer from the website HackForums.net. I always recommend using a wildcard search over a standard query, as it may catch misspellings or similar accounts associated with your target. While the site offers username and telephone search, I have found the results to be minimal. I primarily use it for email and Bitcoin queries.

### Domain Registration Details

Every domain name registration includes an email address. Although many people use privacy services to hide personal details, this is not always the case. Several free services collect domain registration details and offer queries of current and archived data. These services can identify domain names registered with the target email address, which is particularly useful for tech-savvy targets who may have registered websites you are not aware of. This also works for domains that no longer exist.

As a test, I provided the email address brad@noda.com. The following results were identified by each service:

- **Imitation Email Provider**
- **Email Addresses: 269**

While this is a staged demo, the results are impressive. I have been able to convert a personal email address into a full resume, including social network profiles and a cellular telephone number.

### JSON Format Results

The results are presented in JSON format. Here is a partial summary:

```json

  "work_email": "PI:EMAIL",
  "mobile_phone": "+14155688415",
  "email_address": "PI:EMAIL",
  "education": "University of Oregon"
}
```

### Email Provider Identification

If your targetâ€™s email address ends in @gmail.com or @yahoo.com, the email provider is obvious. However, business addresses and custom domain names do not reveal the hosting service. The email provider is listed in the domain's MX record. You may need this information for court orders or to document it for future use. The following steps will help you obtain the email provider from almost any address:

1. Navigate to MX Toolbox (mxtoolbox.com).
2. Enter the domain of the email address.
3. The result will include a hostname and IP address, identifying the email provider.

For example, if the host is `mx1.mailchannels.net`, Mail Channels is likely the email host. This technique helps identify the email providers behind business email accounts, which can be useful in connecting individuals to shell companies. Changes in providers could indicate paranoia or intent to conceal evidence.
