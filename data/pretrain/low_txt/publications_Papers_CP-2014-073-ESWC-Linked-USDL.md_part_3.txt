### Adoption of Linked USDL
It is worth noting that several concepts not explicitly covered are sometimes redundant (e.g., Condition is subclassed in many modules) or were seldom properly understood and used (e.g., Functions, Phases of interactions, Service Level Agreements).

## Suitability for Tasks and Applications
Given that Linked USDL does not cover all concepts present in USDL, it is important to assess the impact of these decisions. Table 2 shows the main aspects and their current coverage. In qualitative terms, the decisions adopted mean that Linked USDL does not currently provide support for capturing how providers deliver services in terms of resources needed, complex internal workflows, or strategic decisions (e.g., targeted markets). This is due to two reasons:
1. Such aspects are often not automated, and when they are, providers already have mechanisms in place.
2. These are private concerns orthogonal to the trading of services.

Similarly, Linked USDL does not include support for conceptualizing complex agreements, including legal requirements and guarantees, as these were rarely used or understood by users. We have opted for a simple mechanism for capturing prices and deferred more complex dynamic pricing to a separate module, as these are less frequently used and usually remain private to the provider.

Despite these changes, Linked USDL provides advanced support for modeling, comparing, discovering, and trading services and service bundles. It enables tracking and reasoning about the involvement of entities within delivery chains, informing the trading and comparison of services, and tracing and analyzing service value networks. It also supports automating interactions between actors during the service life cycle, capturing service offerings, combining services and products, and applying temporal reasoning, which were previously unavailable. Most importantly, these activities can be achieved with a higher level of automation, benefiting from automated reasoning, and can be performed on a Web-scale across websites and service providers, thanks to capturing and sharing the semantics of services as Linked Data.

## Empirical Evaluation
The suitability of the language for supporting the automation of key tasks has been evaluated through two main means:
1. Reusing and developing tools that provide support for these tasks.
2. Continuously applying Linked USDL in various domains.

In terms of reuse, Linked USDL benefits from general-purpose tooling (e.g., SPARQL engines and RDF stores) and vocabulary-specific solutions, particularly for discovering, composing, and invoking technical services (i.e., RESTful and WSDL services) described in terms of MSM [18]. Additionally, a Web-based Linked USDL editor is available to help providers easily generate Linked USDL descriptions. An advanced multi-party dynamic and open service marketplace developed in the context of the FI-WARE project [14] gathers, combines, and exploits rich service descriptions from distributed providers to help match offer and demand. The marketplace supports consumers in searching for, comparing, and contracting service offerings.

Linked USDL is currently being applied in various domains. For instance, in the field of Software as a Service, we have explored the use of Linked USDL in conjunction with TOSCA [21]. Linked USDL was used to formalize, structure, and simplify the discovery and selection of services for the Web-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform Sugar-CRM, while TOSCA supported the automated deployment and management of the services. This work also helped evaluate the extensibility of Linked USDL by integrating it with complementary third-party specifications such as TOSCA. In the FI-WARE project, Linked USDL supports a service infrastructure covering both technical and business perspectives. The FINEST [15] project aims to support the transport and logistics (T&L) ecosystem, where many service providers collaborate to transport goods over a "chain of legs." Linked USDL is being used to plan chains of legs, supporting the search and matching of transport service offerings in a transparent, distributed, and multi-party manner.

Across the diverse domains where Linked USDL is being applied, it has proven to be a valuable resource for providing shared and globally accessible service descriptions that integrate both technical and business aspects. The genericity, modularity, and extensibility of the approach have enabled extending the vocabulary with dedicated domain-specific vocabularies in the areas of SaaS and T&L, while generic software infrastructure was easily reused across domains.

## Vocabulary Adoption and Use
When evaluating ontologies and vocabularies, adoption and use are often considered. This evaluation may focus on the ontology itself and/or the different ontologies it imports. The former indicates the acceptance and adoption of the ontology in its entirety, while the latter provides a more granular assessment of the reused ontologies. In this section, we primarily address the latter but also provide preliminary indications of the overall adoption of Linked USDL.

The methodology followed, as described in Section 4.2, centered on the reuse of widely adopted vocabularies. Table 1 presents the main vocabularies identified through search engines, along with core indicators of their use on the Web. These figures highlight that Linked USDL is based on vocabularies that are the most used in their respective domains of interest. Only two exceptions exist: AKT Signage, which was not adopted because it was not dereferenceable, and Schema.org, which is indirectly aligned via GR. This approach reduces the potential overhead of using Linked USDL, as frequently reused vocabularies are likely to have greater acceptance and support by people and existing systems.

Additionally, the availability of datasets with instances in terms of the reused vocabularies ensures that new descriptions can reuse and link to existing resources, e.g., allowing the reuse of descriptions of companies. This provides clear benefits from the perspective of data acquisition, one of the main concerns Linked USDL aimed to address. By linking to existing instances, the data provided is enriched, enabling further advanced processing and increasing the discoverability of services.

A substantial account of the adoption of Linked USDL would require a reasonable wait from its first release, which coincides with this publication. Nonetheless, Linked USDL is currently in use within more than 10 research projects, including FI-WARE, FINEST, Value4Cloud, Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek, MSEE, FIspace, FITMAN, FI-CONTENT, ENVIROFI, OUTSMART, SMARTAGRIFOOD, IoT-A, Broker@Cloud, and GEYSERS. These projects use Linked USDL as the core vocabulary for describing services, validating its suitability, genericity, and extensibility for different domains. This highlights that despite its youth, Linked USDL is already witnessing promising adoption.

## Conclusion
Despite the importance of services in developed economies and the widespread adoption of worldwide electronic commerce over the Web, most service trading is still carried out via traditional and often manual communication means. A fundamental reason for this is the difficulty in capturing the abundant information and knowledge governing services and their related transactions in a way amenable to computer automation. Among the wealth of work around services, USDL is the most comprehensive solution proposed thus far for enabling (semi)automated service trading. However, work on its standardization highlighted several limitations for Web-scale service trading.

We have presented Linked USDL, the next evolution of USDL, centered on fostering wider adoption and better automation support through the (re)use of Linked Data. Linked USDL has been developed following a methodology centered on maximizing the reuse of existing vocabularies and datasets and minimizing complexity. The resulting vocabulary has been evaluated in terms of domain coverage, suitability for purpose, and vocabulary adoption.

Despite the good evaluation results obtained, Linked USDL is one step towards enabling Web-scale service trading, albeit a fundamental one. Further work is required to cover aspects such as complex dynamic pricing models and agreements, which are common in certain domains like Cloud services. Additionally, from the tooling perspective, developing advanced mechanisms to support steps such as negotiation between service providers and consumers, or the bundling of services, would also be necessary. We expect to take inspiration and adapt solutions developed for the e3 family of ontologies.
