### Title: Botconf2018 - Hunting and Detecting APTs Using Sysmon and PowerShell Logging

Security professionals and Blue Team members highly value comprehensive APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) reports from reputable security firms. These reports are particularly valuable when they document and explain novel, stealthy techniques that are not yet widely known to defenders. Some of these techniques include:

- **WMI Event Subscription for Persistence**: This method, utilized by APT29, allows attackers to maintain a persistent presence on a compromised system.
- **Logon Script Technique**: APT28 has employed this technique, which involves the use of the "UserInitMprLogonScript" registry key to execute malicious scripts during user logon.
- **PowerShell Abuse and Living Off the Land (LOL)**: Attackers often leverage PowerShell to execute their payloads, relying on built-in tools and scripts to avoid detection.
- **Unmanaged PowerShell**: To evade command-line-based detection, attackers may use unmanaged PowerShell, such as PowerPick, to execute their commands. However, with the logging features introduced in PowerShell version 5, even these tactics can be detected.

In this presentation, I will demonstrate how to detect and mitigate these techniques using Sysmon data and PowerShell logging, with Splunk serving as the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform.
