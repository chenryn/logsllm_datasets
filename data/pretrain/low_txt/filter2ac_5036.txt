**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Execution Prevention

To enhance security, it is recommended to implement application control where appropriate. Starting with Windows Version 2203, VBA macros obtained from the Internet, as indicated by the file's Mark of the Web (MOTW) attribute, are blocked from executing in Office applications (such as Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, and Word) by default. 

This measure helps prevent the execution of potentially malicious code and reduces the risk of compromise.
