**ATT&CK ID:** T1216  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** System Script Proxy Execution

Adversaries may exploit trusted scripts, often signed with valid certificates, to proxy the execution of malicious files. Several Microsoft-signed scripts, which are either downloaded from official Microsoft sources or included by default in Windows installations, can be leveraged for this purpose. By using these trusted scripts, adversaries can execute malicious files that might otherwise be blocked by application control and signature validation mechanisms. This technique allows attackers to bypass security controls and execute unauthorized code on the target system.
