## IoT - Introduction
- **Definition:**
  - The Internet of Things (IoT) involves the inter-networking of physical devices, vehicles, buildings, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity. This enables these objects to collect and exchange data.
  - IoT allows for remote sensing and control of objects across existing network infrastructure.

## Security in IoT
- **Challenges:**
  - Numerous vulnerabilities due to hardware and software issues.

## IoT Devices on the Internet
- **Vulnerability Examples:**
  - Hardware
  - Software

## Why So Many Vulnerabilities?
- **Hardware:**
  - Inexperienced developers
  - Programming language
  - Outdated kernel
  - Unknown OS
  - Outdated firmware
  - Lack of software update mechanism
  - 3rd party services

- **Software:**
  - Path Traversal
  - DHCP
  - Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM)
  - Firmware Upgrade
  - Upload Arbitrary Files
  - Header Injection (Global Variables)
  - API Disclosure
  - Hard-coded Credentials
  - Command Injection
  - Memory Disclosure

## Vulnerability Types
### Memory Disclosure
- **Description:**
  - A memory leak is an unintentional form of memory consumption where the developer fails to free an allocated block of memory when no longer needed.

### Hard-coded Credentials
- **Description:**
  - The use of hard-coded passwords increases the possibility of password guessing significantly.

### Command Injection
- **Description:**
  - An attack where the goal is to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application.
  - Possible when an application passes unsafe user-supplied data (e.g., forms, cookies, HTTP headers) to a system shell.
  - Insufficient input validation is a common cause.

### Path Traversal
- **Description:**
  - Aims to access files and directories stored outside the web root folder.
  - Manipulating variables that reference files with "dot-dot-slash (../)" sequences or using absolute file paths can lead to accessing arbitrary files and directories.

### Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM)
- **Description:**
  - An attack that intercepts communication between two systems.

## Example 1: HiSilicon ASIC Chipset Firmware
- **Overview:**
  - HiSilicon provides ASICs and solutions for communication networks and digital media, used in over 100 countries.
  - The firmware includes a built-in web server called Sofia, which is vulnerable to directory path traversal.
  - The web server does not filter HTTP GET requests, allowing attackers to read sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.

## Example 2: Xiaomi Air Purifier 2
- **Overview:**
  - High-performance smart air purifier (IoT) that can be controlled remotely.
  - Version 1.2.4_59 uses plain-text HTTP for firmware updates, making it susceptible to attacks.
  - Potential risks include obtaining the firmware binary for analysis and injecting modified firmware.

## Example 3: GoAhead Web Server
- **Overview:**
  - Present on multiple embedded devices, including IP cameras and printers.
  - A vulnerability allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to disclose the content of accessed files.
  - Requests without a leading '/' bypass HTTP basic authentication.

## Example 4: Geneko Routers
- **Overview:**
  - Geneko GWG provides cellular capabilities for fixed and mobile applications.
  - User-controlled input is not sufficiently sanitized, leading to direct access to any file on the router.

## Example 5: Hack2Win and D-Link 850L
- **Hack2Win:**
  - An online hacking competition where participants attempt to hack a connected product.
  - Target: D-Link 850L
  - Prizes: $5,000, $2,500, and $1,000 for first, second, and third place, respectively.
- **Results:**
  - Remote Unauthenticated Command Execution via WAN
  - Remote Unauthenticated Information Disclosure
  - Remote Unauthenticated Command Execution via LAN

### Remote Unauthenticated Command Execution via WAN
- **Description:**
  - Combination of two different vulnerabilities:
    - Unauthenticated upload of arbitrary files
    - Execution of arbitrary commands by authenticated users with administrator privileges
  - Exploitation involves manipulating XML settings sent to `hedwig.cgi` and loading service scripts in `fatlady.php`.

### Remote Unauthenticated Information Disclosure
- **Description:**
  - Bypassing security checks using global variables to read arbitrary files.

### Remote Unauthenticated Command Execution via LAN
- **Description:**
  - Exploiting the `dnsmasq` daemon running as root to execute commands through the DHCP server.

## Example 6: FLIR Thermal/Infrared Camera
- **Remote Unauthenticated Information Disclosure:**
  - Disclosed API functionalities and file contents.
- **Remote Unauthenticated Video Stream Disclosure:**
  - Access to live video streams.
- **Remote Unauthenticated Code Execution:**
  - Execution of arbitrary commands via the `controllerFlirSystem.php` script.

### Hard-coded Credentials Remote Root Access
- **Credentials:**
  - `root:indigo`
  - `root:video`
  - `default:video`
  - `default:[blank]`
  - `ftp:video`

## Example 7: Polycom
- **Memory Disclosure:**
  - Vulnerable to memory info leaks in the web interface.
  - Uploading files with NULL characters can expose raw memory.

## What Should I Do?
- **Path Traversal:**
  - Implement proper input validation and file path sanitization.
- **Firmware Update:**
  - Ensure recovery mechanisms are in place.
  - Apply updates only when the system is manually restarted or prompt the user.
  - Validate the update's integrity and source.
  - Choose appropriate patching techniques.
- **Hard-coded Users/Passwords:**
  - Avoid using hard-coded credentials for maintenance.
- **Input Validation:**
  - Properly validate all client and environmental input.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM):**
  - Implement certificate-based authentication.
  - Upgrade to HTTPS protocol using SSL/TLS certificates.
- **Memory Disclosure:**
  - Use tools like Valgrind to detect and fix memory leaks.

## Getting Started
- **Network Scanning:**
  - Scan your network to identify open ports and close vulnerable ones.
  - Update firmware regularly.
  - Avoid unsupported devices (last firmware update > one year).
  - Change default passwords.
