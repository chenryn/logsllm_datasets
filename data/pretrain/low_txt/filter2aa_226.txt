## What is Crestron?
Crestron is a leading provider of IoT device controllers used in various environments for:
- Audio/Video distribution
- Lighting and shading control
- Home automation
- Building management systems (BACNET)
- Access control and security
- And more...

### Fully Programmable and Customizable
- **SIMPL (Symbol Intensive Master Programming Language)**
  - Used for writing programs that control UI and device actions.
- **Device Control Methods:**
  - Infrared (IR)
  - Serial
  - TCP/IP
  - Relay
  - MIDI
  - Cresnet
- **Interactions and Programming:**
  - Devices can be programmed and controlled via Crestron Terminal Protocol (CTP).
  - Crestron devices communicate internally using Crestron Internet Protocol (CIP).
  - Programming is complex and typically handled by professionals.

## Deployment
Crestron systems are widely deployed in:
- Universities
- Office environments
- Sports arenas
- Airports
- Hotels
- High-end residential properties

### Notable Deployments
- **Microsoft:** Chose Crestron as its exclusive partner for managing all AV and meeting room resources worldwide.

## Products
- **3-Series Controllers:**
  - CP3, MC3, PRO3
  - DIN rail
- **Touch Screens:**
  - TSx, TPCS, TPMC
  - Commonly deployed in "one in every room" setups

### Platforms
- **Mainly Windows:**
  - Most products run on WinCE 6.
  - Some use other embedded Windows versions.
- **Android/Linux:**
  - Touch screens (TSx)
  - Video processors and digital media streamers (DGE-100, DMC-STR, etc.)
  - Specific platform details will be noted where applicable.

## Discovery
- **Magic Packet to UDP 41794 (broadcast or unicast):**
  - Payload: `"\x14\x00\x00\x00\x01\x04\x00\x03\x00\x00" + hostname + "\x00" * (256 - hostname.length)`
  - Response includes: Hostname, Product, Firmware version, Build date.
- **Shodan Results:**
  - Between 20,000 and 23,000 devices.
  - Most common products: CP3 and MC3 (as of 2018/06/11).

## CTP Console
- **Main Programming Interface:**
  - Telnet-like console on TCP 41795.
  - Sandbox file system and commands.
  - Authentication available with different user levels (Administrator, Operator, Programmer, User, etc.).
  - Active Directory integration and encryption.
  - Authentication is disabled by default, relying on the installer to enable it, which often does not happen due to complexity.

### Standard CTP Functionality
- **System and Service Settings:**
  - Authentication, Web portal, SSH/Telnet/FTP, Basic SIP settings.
- **Networking Info/Config:**
  - Arbitrary file upload (fgetfile/fputfile, xgetfile/xputfile).
- **Firmware Updates:**
  - Run and control user programs.
  - Control output to other devices (OSD messages, audio/video playback).

### Hidden CTP Functionality
- **Taskstat:** View running processes.
- **Certificate Management:** View and modify stored certificates.
- **Dr Watson Dumps:** On WinCE.
- **Direct Chip Communication:** Readi2c/writei2c (WinCE).
- **Browser Remote Control:** Browseropen/browserclose (Android).
- **UI Interaction:** Fakekey/faketouch (Android).
- **Audio Recording:** Recwave (Android).

## Vulnerabilities
- **Command Injection Vulnerabilities on Android Platform:**
  - 22 command injection vulnerabilities found in the CTP console.
  - Examples: ping (CVE-2018-5553), adduser, cd, copyfile, delete, dir, fgetfile, fputfile, isdir, makedir, movefile, removedir, routeadd, routedelete, udir, updatepassword, wifipskpassword, wifissid, wifiwephexpassword, wifiweppassword, and more.
  - Commands are implemented programmatically on WinCE but simply punted to the shell on Android.

### Exploitation
- **Routeadd/routedelete Exploitation:**
  - **First Problem:** Arguments are up-cased before use, causing case-sensitivity issues on Linux.
  - **Solution:** Create a shell script named "BLAH" and upload it with fgetfile.
  - **Second Problem:** Uploaded scripts lack execution permissions.
  - **Solution:** Use `$0$IFS./BLAH` to execute the script, leveraging the calling program's name.

## Conclusions
- **Security Practices:**
  - Good security practices are possible but are disabled by default.
  - Installers and programmers often prioritize functionality over security.
  - Normal users are unaware of potential security issues.
  - If security is not enabled by default, it is unlikely to be enabled.
- **Deployment Risks:**
  - Wide deployment in sensitive environments increases the risk of insider threats.
  - Potential for boardroom spying, corporate espionage, and tampering with building/access control systems.
  - Even isolated networks are not secure enough.
- **Platform Security:**
  - The Android platform appears less secure than the WinCE platform.
  - Crestron has a long history with WinCE and Microsoft partnerships.
  - Newer to the Linux/Android world, leading to product fragmentation.

## Future Work
- **Auditing:**
  - More CTP attack surface exploration.
  - SIMPL and PUF analysis.
  - Other services (CIP, HTTP, FTP, SIP, SNMP, SSH, Telnet, etc.).
  - Other products (Fusion, Xpanel, AirMedia, XIO Cloud, etc.).
  - IOAVA.
