# Technical Data

The mission of Microsoft’s Government Security Program (GSP) is to build trust through transparency and provide security information to government agencies and international organizations. Since its inception in 2003, GSP has offered visibility into Microsoft's technology and security artifacts, enabling these entities to protect their nations and citizens from security threats. The Technical Data offering provides security assurance by granting access to a wide range of confidential technical information (excluding source code), allowing participants to evaluate the trustworthiness and establish confidence in Microsoft products and services.

## Access Enablement

If you have assurance questions or need access to confidential information, the Technical Data offering allows GSP participants to request and review relevant materials, as well as engage with Microsoft experts. Access includes:

- **Written Materials**: Documentation such as internal white papers, architecture documents, and compliance reports.
- **Direct Dialogue**: Coordinated meetings with Microsoft engineers and security experts.
- **Early Access**: Advance documentation about Microsoft’s products and services.

## Technical Trips

Technical trips are in-person, focused conversations with Microsoft engineers and security experts, designed to address specific security concerns and enhance participants' confidence in Microsoft products and services. These deep technical discussions cover a variety of security topics and are tailored to the agency's needs. The GSP team works closely with the agency to understand their security assurance goals and to select the most appropriate Microsoft engineering teams for the meetings. Technical trips are scheduled based on the availability of Microsoft engineering teams.

### Sample Topics for Technical Trips:
- Cyber Threat Intelligence (DCU)
- Vulnerability and Incident Response Processes
- Product Security Features
- Telemetry

## Use Cases

- **Confidential Documentation**: Reviewing security content related to Microsoft’s cloud services that is not broadly released.
- **Engagements with Engineers**: Participating in various formats, including Technical Adoption Programs (TAP).
- **Cloud Service Security, Privacy, and Compliance**: Access to audit reports, risk assessments, and other compliance-related documents.
- **Common Criteria Evaluation Documents**: Detailed evaluations for Windows.
- **Focused Conversations**: Opportunities for in-depth discussions, such as technical trips and executive briefings.
