**Title: Botconf 2022 - Detecting Emerging Malware on Cloud Platforms Before VirusTotal Can Identify It**

In this session, we will introduce our innovative approach for identifying and predicting the behavior of newly emerging malware on cloud platforms, often before VirusTotal or any other third-party detection engine can report it. Our methodology combines an advanced anomaly detection system, referred to as GAD (General Anomaly Detection), with a graph pattern-learning machine. This integrated approach enables us to detect and predict the behavior of emerging threats more effectively.
