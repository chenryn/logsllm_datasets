When using Internet Explorer in Edge mode, I noticed that the form is marked as "dirty" upon initialization. According to my research, this was previously identified as a bug in IE and reportedly fixed. However, I am still encountering this issue.

For reference, here are some related resources:

Do you have any suggestions or ideas on how to resolve this?
