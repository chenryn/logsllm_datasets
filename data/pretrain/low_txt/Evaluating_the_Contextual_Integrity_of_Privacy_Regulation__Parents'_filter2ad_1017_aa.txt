## Abstract
The growing concern over data privacy has led to the introduction and updating of data protection regulations worldwide. However, there is no established method to rigorously test whether these regulatory practices align with the privacy norms of the affected populations. This paper demonstrates that surveys based on the theory of contextual integrity (CI) offer a quantifiable and scalable approach to measuring the conformity of specific regulatory provisions to privacy norms. We apply this method to the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), surveying 195 parents to provide the first empirical evidence that COPPA's mandates generally align with parents' privacy expectations for Internet-connected "smart" children's toys. Despite this alignment, variations in the acceptability of data collection across specific smart toys, types of information, parent ages, and other factors highlight the importance of detailed contextual factors, which may not be fully captured by COPPA.

## 1. Introduction
Data privacy protections in the United States are enforced through a combination of state and federal legislation and regulatory action. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a prominent example of strong, centralized privacy legislation, inspiring similar laws in other countries, such as the Brazilian General Data Privacy Law. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 57% of countries had data protection and privacy legislation as of 2018.

While data privacy protections vary across countries in terms of details and implementation, many share a common origin: public pressure to protect sensitive personal data from unauthorized use or release. Surveys indicate that consumers worldwide were more concerned about online privacy in 2016 than in 2014, and over 60% of U.S. respondents in 2018 expressed concern about data privacy. However, there has been no rigorous, quantifiable, and scalable way to measure whether existing legal privacy protections align with the privacy expectations of affected individuals. Without such data, it is difficult to determine which aspects of privacy regulation effectively align company behaviors with social and cultural privacy norms and which require further revision.

In this paper, we demonstrate that an existing survey technique based on the formal privacy theory of contextual integrity (CI) can be directly adapted to test the conformity of specific regulatory requirements to privacy norms, providing much-needed data to policymakers and the privacy research community. The survey technique can be applied to any privacy regulation that defines guidelines for data collection and transfer practices. Importantly, the survey technique involves questions describing privacy scenarios that are concrete and understandable to respondents from all backgrounds. It also allows straightforward longitudinal and cross-sector measurements to track the effectiveness of regulatory updates over time.

We present a rigorous case study of this technique, evaluating the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which provides a federal legal framework to protect the online privacy of children under the age of 13. Specifically, we investigate whether parents' opinions about the acceptability of data collection practices by Internet-connected "smart" children's toys match COPPA mandates. Since the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) only updated its guidance on COPPA to explicitly include "connected toys or other Internet of Things devices" in June 2017, our results provide the first indication as to whether COPPA aligns with parents' privacy expectations.

This question is particularly relevant given recent high-profile security breaches of smart toys, such as the theft of personal information of over 6 million children from toy manufacturer VTech and vulnerabilities in Mattel’s Hello Barbie. More recently, Germany banned children’s smart watches and Genesis Toys’ My Friend Cayla doll, citing security risks and "spying concerns."

We surveyed a panel of 195 U.S. parents of children aged 3 to 13, the largest sample size for a study of parent opinions on smart toy data collection to date. Our findings indicate that parents generally view information collection predicated on requirements specified by COPPA (e.g., "if the information is used to protect a child’s safety") as acceptable, while viewing equivalent information collection without COPPA-specified conditions as unacceptable. This suggests that the existing conditions COPPA places on information collection by smart toys are generally in line with parents' privacy norms, although there may be additional data collection requirements that could be added to regulation, which were not tested in our study.

Additionally, we found that COPPA requirements for notification and consent result in more acceptable data collection practices than requirements related to confidentiality and security. This corroborates previous work indicating the primary importance of consent to user privacy norms. We also found variations in the acceptability of COPPA-permitted data collection practices across specific smart toys, types of information, certain information use cases, parent ages, parent familiarity with COPPA, and whether parents own smart devices. These variations emphasize the importance of detailed contextual factors to parents' privacy norms and motivate additional studies of populations with privacy norms that may be poorly represented by COPPA.

We conclude by noting that COPPA's information collection criteria are broad enough to allow smart toy implementations that compromise children’s privacy while still adhering to the letter of the law. Continuing reports of smart toys violating COPPA also suggest that many non-compliant toys remain available for purchase. Further improvements to both data privacy regulation and enforcement are still needed to keep pace with corporate practices, technological advancements, and privacy norms.

In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
- Demonstrates that an existing survey method based on contextual integrity can be applied to test whether privacy regulations effectively match the norms of affected populations.
- Provides the first quantitative evidence that COPPA's restrictions on smart toy data collection generally align with parents' privacy expectations.
- Serves as a template for future work using contextual integrity surveys to analyze current or proposed privacy regulation for policy or systems design insights.

## 2. Background & Related Work
### 2.1 Contextual Integrity
The theory of contextual integrity (CI) provides a well-established framework for studying privacy norms and expectations. CI defines privacy as the appropriateness of information flows based on social or cultural norms in specific contexts. CI describes information flows using five parameters: (1) the subject of the information being transferred, (2) the sender of this information, (3) the attribute or type of information, (4) the recipient of the information, and (5) the transmission principle or condition imposed on the transfer of information from the sender to the recipient. For example, one might be comfortable with a search engine (recipient) collecting their (subject & sender) Internet browsing history (attribute) in order to improve search results (transmission principle), but not in order to improve advertisement targeting, which is a different transmission principle that places the information in a different context governed by different norms. Privacy norms can therefore be inferred from the reported appropriateness and acceptability of information flows with varying combinations of these five parameters.

Previous research has used CI to discover and analyze privacy norms in various contexts. In 2012, Winter used CI to design an interview study investigating Internet of things (IoT) device practices that could be viewed as privacy violations. In 2016, Martin and Nissenbaum conducted a survey with vignette questions based on CI to understand discrepancies between people’s stated privacy values and their actions in online spaces. They found that these discrepancies are due to nuanced effects of contextual information informing real-world actions. This result motivates the use of CI in our study and others to investigate privacy norms in realistic situations.

In 2016, Shvartzshnaider et al. used the language of CI to survey crowdworkers' privacy expectations regarding information flow in the education domain. Survey respondents indicated whether information flows situated in clearly defined contexts violated acceptability norms. The results were converted into a logic specification language which could be used to verify privacy norm consistency and identify additional acceptable information flows.

In 2018, we designed a scalable survey method for discovering privacy norms using questions based on CI. We applied the survey method to measure the acceptability of 3,840 information flows involving common connected devices for consumer homes. Results from 1,731 Amazon Mechanical Turk respondents informed recommendations for IoT device manufacturers, policymakers, and regulators.

This paper adapts the survey method from our previous work for a specific application: comparing privacy norms to privacy regulation. Our use of language from regulation in CI survey questions, direct comparison of discovered privacy norms to policy compliance plans, and survey panel of special interest individuals (parents of children under age 13) distinguishes our work from previous uses of the survey method and previous CI studies in general.

### 2.2 COPPA & Smart Toys
Previous research has investigated Internet-connected toys and COPPA from various perspectives. Several studies have focused on identifying privacy and/or security vulnerabilities of specific smart toys, some of which are expressly noted as COPPA violations. Our work uses these examples to inform the information flow descriptions included in our survey.

Researchers have also developed methods to automate the detection of COPPA violations. In 2017, Zimmeck et al. automatically analyzed 9,050 mobile application privacy policies and found that only 36% contained statements on user access, editing, and deletion rights required by COPPA. In 2018, Reyes et al. automatically analyzed 5,855 Android applications designed for children and found that a majority potentially violated COPPA. Most violations were due to the collection of personally identifiable information or other identifiers via third-party software development kits (SDKs) used by the applications, often in violation of SDK terms of service. These widespread violations indicate that COPPA remains insufficiently enforced. Nevertheless, COPPA remains the primary legal foundation for state and federal action against IoT toy manufacturers and other technology companies for children’s privacy breaches.

Additional work has investigated parents’ and children’s relationships with Internet-connected toys. In 2015, Manches et al. conducted observational fieldwork of children playing with Internet-connected toys and held in-school workshops to investigate parents’ and children’s cognizance of how IoT toys work. They found that most children and caregivers were unaware of IoT toys’ data collection potential, but quickly learned fundamental concepts of connected toy design when instructed.

In 2017, McReynolds et al. conducted interviews with parents and children to understand their mental models of and experience with Internet-connected toys. Parents in this study were more aware of and concerned about IoT toy privacy than in the 2015 study, likely due to the intervening two years of negative publicity about connected toy privacy issues. The parents interviewed provided feedback about desired privacy properties for connected toys, such as improved parental controls and recording indicators. The researchers urge ongoing enforcement of COPPA, but do not evaluate the parents’ responses in light of the law.

Our work builds on past research by obtaining opinions about smart toy information collection and transfer practices from a much larger pool of parents (195 subjects). We use these data to evaluate whether privacy protections mandated by COPPA align with parents’ privacy norms.

## 3. CI Survey Method
This study adapts a CI-based survey method first presented in our previous work to evaluate whether specific requirements in privacy regulations align with user privacy norms. We chose this particular survey method because it is previously tested, scalable to large respondent populations, and easily adaptable to specific domains. The survey method works as follows, with our modifications for regulation analysis marked in italics:

1. **Information Transfers ("Flows")**: Information transfers are defined according to CI as sets of five parameters: subject, sender, attribute, recipient, and transmission principle (described in Section 2.1).
2. **Parameter Selection**: We select lists of values for each of these parameters drawn from or directly relevant to a particular piece of privacy regulation. Using these values, we generate a combinatorial number of information flow descriptions allowed or disallowed by the regulation.
3. **Survey Design**: Survey respondents rate the acceptability of these information flows, each of which describe a concrete data collection scenario in an understandable context.
4. **Comparison**: Comparing the average acceptability of flows allowed or disallowed by the regulation indicates how well they align with respondents’ privacy norms.
5. **Analysis of Variations**: Variations in acceptability contingent upon specific information flow parameters or respondent demographics can reveal nuances in privacy norms that may or may not be well served by the regulation.

The following sections provide detailed descriptions of our survey design (Sections 3.1–3.2), deployment (Section 3.3), and results analysis (Section 3.4) for comparing parents’ privacy norms about smart toy data collection against COPPA regulation. Many of these steps mirror those in our previous work, but we include them here with specific details from this study for the sake of replicability.

### 3.1 Generating Smart Toy Information Flows
We first selected CI information flow parameters (Table 1) involving smart toys and specific data collection requirements from COPPA. We then programmatically generated information flow descriptions from all possible combinations of the selected CI parameters.

Next, we discarded certain information flow descriptions with unrealistic sender/attribute pairs, such as a toy speaker (sender) recording a child’s heart rate (attribute). Unrealistic sender/attribute pairs were identified at the authors’ discretion based on whether each toy could reasonably be expected to have access to each type of data during normal use. This decision was informed by smart toy products currently available on the market. The use of exclusions to remove unrealistic scenarios ensures that the survey questions are meaningful and relevant to the respondents.
