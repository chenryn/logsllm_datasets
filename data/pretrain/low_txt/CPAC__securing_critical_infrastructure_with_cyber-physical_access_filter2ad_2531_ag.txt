### Included PLCs and Access Control Mechanisms

The study included Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) from Siemens (31%), Rockwell (22%), Mitsubishi Electric (13%), and Schneider Electric (8%). We found that all four vendors rely solely on password authorization, typically with a single privilege level. Additionally, password authentication can be disabled in all four systems. Recently, more advanced access control capabilities have been added to Human-Machine Interface (HMI) engineering software. For example, certain Siemens systems, such as SIMATIC STEP 7 TIA Portal, now use client-side authentication for individual Integrated Development Environment (IDE) projects. Furthermore, recent device fingerprinting mechanisms (e.g., [32]) facilitate the deployment of higher-level access control functionalities, such as Cyber-Physical Access Control (CPAC), in control systems. However, almost none of the existing control system access control solutions consider the physical dynamics of the plant when defining or enforcing policies. This oversight allows attackers to bypass authentication by exploiting the physical system's dynamics and inter-component interdependencies, thereby disclosing sensitive measurements and manipulating critical plant actuation points.

### Information Flow Analysis

Many existing solutions propose information flow control [65, 61] and dynamic taint analyzers [20] for general-purpose computing systems, smartphones [29], and embedded devices [64]. However, these solutions are rarely used in real-world control systems due to:
1. High run-time performance overheads, which limit their deployability in safety-critical, real-time settings.
2. Insufficient accuracy, as they often ignore physical-side information flows.

Existing control system data historians [33] within energy management systems [4] provide bulk, database-level offline information flow control between large power system areas (control centers). These coarse-grained solutions:
1. Do not support dynamic or fine-grained information flow control.
2. Often result in inflexible architectures, being either too permissive (allowing data exchange between two control centers) or too restrictive (prohibiting any database exchange).
3. Completely miss the physical dependencies between various database entries within and across control centers.

### Conclusions

We present CPAC, a cyber-physical access control solution designed to protect industrial control systems against operational mistakes and insider attacks. CPAC implements lightweight, on-device, and mathematically sound physical-side information flow analyses to maintain a complete system view. It uses physical system models, information flow tracking, and logic-based, context-aware policies to prevent operations that could harm the system or leak sensitive information to malicious insiders. Our experimental results with CPAC's working prototype on Bachmann PLCs and Energy Management System (EMS) servers show that CPAC can terminate several past real control system incidents and perform N-x contingency analysis with a runtime performance overhead of only 150 ms.

### First Order Taylor Series Expansion

The first-order Taylor series expansion of (2) is given in (6). For line flow analysis, \( w \) is the line flow vector, and \( u \) is the vector of series capacitor reactances. \( f_x \) is the Jacobian matrix known from the Newton-Raphson method, and the Jacobian matrices \( w_u \), \( w_x \), and \( f_u \) are shown in Figure 13.

For higher policy enforcement accuracy, considering higher-order dynamics of the plant, CPAC uses a second-order approximation as in (8). The second-order Jacobian matrices \( w_{xx} \), \( w_{ux} \), and \( w_{uu} \) for line flow analysis are shown in Figure 13.

### Four Bus Power System Case Study

#### Case B: Ensuring Safe Power Grid Control

**Scenario:** The power system is already in an unsafe state (shown in Figure 11a), where two transmission lines experience high currents. Bob, as the control operator, requests to increase the generation set-point on power bus 2. Based on the power system flow equations, this would increase line flows across the system.

**Source of Incident:** Lack of enforcement of control system integrity.

**Required Access Control Policy:** In the case of unsafe states, control operators must not take actions that further worsen the situation (i.e., increasing overflows).

**Effects of CPAC Deployment:** CPAC denies Bob’s request because his action would violate the policy (Figure 12). The action would drive the system further into less safe states while it is already unsafe.

#### Case C: Inter-area Power Transfer Regulation
