### 8. Conclusion

We conducted a field study using the telemetry platforms of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, collecting data on 25,405,944 warning impressions. Our findings indicate that browser security warnings can be effective: users clicked through fewer than a quarter of both browsers' malware and phishing warnings, and a third of Mozilla Firefox's SSL warnings. However, we also observed clickthrough rates as high as 70.2% for Google Chrome's SSL warnings, suggesting that the user experience of a warning significantly influences user behavior. Additionally, warning effectiveness varies across different demographic groups. These results underscore the need for further research into browser security warnings, with a particular focus on demographic factors. At Google, we have already begun experimenting with new warning designs to enhance their effectiveness.

### 7.3. Demographics

Our analysis revealed that clickthrough rates differ based on the operating system and browser channel. Users with higher technical skills, such as those using Linux and pre-release channels, are more likely to click through certain types of warnings. We recommend further investigation into user demographics and their impact on behavior. Large-scale demographic studies could uncover additional factors that were not within the scope of our current methodology. If such factors are identified, can warning design address and mitigate these demographic differences? Advanced users may feel more confident in their computer's security, be more curious about blocked websites, or feel patronized by warnings. Understanding these users better could help improve their response to warnings.

### 7.4. Number of Clicks

Our data suggests that the number of clicks required to bypass a warning does not always have a significant impact on user behavior. For example, to bypass Google Chrome's malware and phishing warnings, users must click twice: first on a small "Advanced" link, and then again to "proceed." Despite this extra step, users click through Google Chrome's malware/phishing warnings at a higher rate than Mozilla Firefox's simpler warning. Furthermore, 84% of users who open Mozilla Firefox's "Add Exception" dialog proceed through it.

This result is surprising, as common e-commerce wisdom suggests that extra clicks decrease clickthrough rates (e.g., one-click shopping). The designers of Google Chrome's warnings introduced the extra step to serve as a strong deterrent. One possible explanation is that users make a single cognitive decision when faced with a warning, based on the URL, warning appearance, or message. Once the user decides to proceed, additional clicks or information are unlikely to change their decision.

Our findings suggest that browser-warning designers should not rely solely on extra clicks to deter users. However, our study was not explicitly designed to examine the effects of multiple clicks. Future studies on multi-click warnings could provide insights into user decision models and inform the design of security warnings. It is possible that extra clicks do not serve as a deterrent until they reach a certain threshold of difficulty.

### 7.5. Warning Fatigue

Our observations are consistent with the theory of warning fatigue. In Google Chrome, users click through the most common SSL errors faster and more frequently. This behavior suggests that repeated exposure to similar warnings can lead to desensitization, reducing the effectiveness of the warnings over time.
