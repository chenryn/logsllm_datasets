### Simulation of the Game with Replaced Challenges

In the simulation, the values \( g^x \) (of the initiator) and \( g^y \) (of the responder) are replaced with challenges from the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) game. The simulator may need to compute \( h^y \) for some group element \( h \) and derive keys from it if the responder received \( h \) in its first message. However, this is impossible under the DDH assumption alone, as the simulator neither knows \( y \) nor has an oracle to compute \( h^y \). Consequently, the simulator cannot faithfully simulate the game.

### Fixing the Problem

To address this issue, both in the original paper and in our setting, stronger assumptions can be employed. For example, the Pseudorandom Function-Oracle Diffie-Hellman (PRF-ODH) assumption [5], [6] can be used. Under this assumption, the adversary has access to an oracle that calculates keys derived from \( h^y \), where \( y \) is one of the secret exponents and \( h \) is provided by the adversary. We leave the formulation of \( F_{\text{crypto}} \) based on the PRF-ODH assumption for future work.

An alternative solution is to sign both \( g^x \) and \( g^y \), as in the SIGMA protocol. This approach allows for an analysis using the DDH assumption, as the signature ensures that the responder pairs \( g^y \) only with \( g^x \). The following theorem states that this variant is a secure, universally composable, unilaterally authenticated key exchange.

### Theorem 5

Let \( M_I \) and \( M_R \) be machines modeling the variant of the 1-RTT non-static mode of OPTLS that signs both \( g^x \) and \( g^y \). Let \( F_{\text{crypto}} \) and \( F'_{\text{crypto}} \) be two versions of the ideal crypto functionality with the same parameters, and let \( F_{\text{UA-key-use}} \) be the ideal functionality for unilaterally authenticated key exchanges with parameter \( t_{\text{key}} = \text{unauthenc-key} \). Then the following holds true:
\[ M_I | M_R | F_{\text{crypto}} \leq_R F_{\text{MA-key-use}} | F'_{\text{crypto}}. \]

The proof of this theorem can be found in our technical report [24]. As before, this proof does not require any reductions or probabilistic reasoning. We can again replace \( F_{\text{crypto}} \) with its realization \( P_{\text{crypto}} \).

### Corollary 3

Let \( M_I \) and \( M_R \) be defined as above, and let \( P_{\text{crypto}} \) and \( F^* \) be as in Theorem 2, particularly, we have that \( P_{\text{crypto}} \leq_R F_{\text{crypto}} \) and \( F^* \) enforces well-behaved environments. Then the following holds true:
\[ F^* | M_I | M_R | P_{\text{crypto}} \leq_R F^* | F_{\text{MA-key-use}} | F_{\text{crypto}}. \]

### Discussion and Related Work

There are several approaches for analyzing security protocols, including symbolic, game-based, implementation-based, and universal composability (UC) approaches. Each approach has its advantages and shortcomings. For instance, real-world protocols like TLS have been studied using all these approaches, often with computer-aided tools.

- **Symbolic (Dolev-Yao-style) Approaches**: These abstract from low-level cryptographic details to offer a high degree of automation.
- **Implementation-Based Analysis**: Captures details of actual protocol implementations, making the analysis more involved but also more realistic.
- **Game-Based Models**: Highly expressive and flexible in defining security properties, though they do not inherently provide modularity.
- **Universal Composability Approaches**: Provide built-in modularity and allow showing that protocols are secure in arbitrary (polynomially bounded) environments, but can be limited in corruption modeling.

Our framework avoids or limits the need for tedious and error-prone reductions while allowing for universally composable security guarantees. Proofs are simplified, and results can be easily reused and built upon.

### Related Work

- **Canetti and Gajek** [45]: Abstract Difﬁe-Hellman key exchange via an ideal key encapsulation functionality. Unlike \( F_{\text{crypto}} \) and our key usability functionalities, their ideal key encapsulation functionality does not allow a user or higher-level protocol to use the exchanged key in an idealized way or with other primitives, which necessitates reduction proofs. Additionally, their approach imposes strong restrictions on the environment, limiting the class of protocols that can be analyzed.
- **Case Studies**: Our case studies, including ISO 9798-3 and SIGMA protocols, have not yet been fully analyzed in a UC setting. Variants of these protocols assume pre-established session identifiers, which differ from the actual protocols and can potentially create a secure protocol from an insecure one.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we propose an ideal functionality \( F_{\text{crypto}} \) that models various cryptographic primitives, supporting Difﬁe-Hellman key exchange. We also provide new functionalities, \( F_{\text{key-use}} \) and \( F_{\text{UA-key-use}} \), for ideal mutual and unilateral authenticated key exchange, which extend the properties of \( F_{\text{crypto}} \) to the next protocol level. Our approach eliminates the need for reductions and hybrid arguments, relying instead on simpler information-theoretic arguments. This simplifies proofs and makes it easier to uncover subtle problems. At the same time, our approach offers high modularity and strong UC security guarantees.

We have illustrated the usefulness of our framework in three case studies, including OPTLS, where we uncovered a subtle problem in the original reduction. In future work, we will apply our framework to other real-world protocols and further extend the framework to facilitate their cryptographic analysis.
