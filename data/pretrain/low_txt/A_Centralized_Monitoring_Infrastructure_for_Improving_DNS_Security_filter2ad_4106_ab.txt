### Test Report: DNSSEC Impact on Broadband Routers and Firewalls

#### September 2008, Version 1.0, Page 11-14

**Original RFC 1035 Specified Maximum Packet Size**
- The original RFC 1035 specified a maximum packet size of 512 bytes.
- Alternatively, the maximum packet size can be set at 28 bytes less than the WAN MTU (i.e., 1464 for ADSL routers and 1472 for most dual Ethernet routers/firewalls).

**Test Results: DNS Proxies and Packet Size**
- Most DNS proxies were unable to return responses with a total packet size greater than the MTU.
- Many proxies could not return responses longer than 512 bytes.

**Request Flag Compatibility**
- **CD ("Checking Disabled") Flag**: This flag informs an upstream validating resolver that full DNSSEC validation is not required. A security-aware resolver should copy the CD bit from the request to its response (RFC4035, ยง3.2.2).
- **AD ("Authentic Data") Flag**: Currently defined only in DNS responses, this flag indicates that the upstream resolver has validated the signatures on the returned data. IETF is working on defining a query containing AD=1 to indicate that the client understands the AD bit and that the server may return the AD bit in responses. ISC Bind 9.5 already implements this proposed change.
- **Test Verification**: We verified that the UDP proxy could pass client-specified AD/CD flags to the security-aware resolver without error and return the resolver's response without modification.
- **Failure Modes**:
  - Two proxies dropped any DNS requests with the AD or CD bit set, possibly due to a strict interpretation of the definition of the Z flags in RFC 1035.
  - One of these two proxies also dropped any DNS response with the AD bit set.
  - Two proxies did not convey these flags from the client's DNS request to the upstream resolver, preventing correct interpretation and use.
- **Summary**: Most proxies handled AD/CD request flags correctly. Those that did not generally could not support any DNSSEC queries.

**DNSSEC OK Compatibility**
- **DO ("DNSSEC OK") Bit**: Defined in RFC 3225, this flag in the EDNS0 OPT RR indicates DNSSEC-awareness and requests that the server return DNSSEC-related resource records.
- **Test Results**:
  - Six proxies failed the EDNS0 tests due to a lack of support for the EDNS0 OPT RR, also failing to handle any DNSSEC queries.
  - One proxy correctly forwarded the OPT RR but dropped any response containing authentic data (AD=1). This proxy also failed all AD/CD request tests, filtering both requests and responses with the AD bit set.
- **Summary**: Approximately 73% (16 out of 22) of the proxies were capable of passing DNSSEC requests to a security-aware resolver and returning complete responses containing authentic data. The rest lacked support for the OPT RR needed to indicate DNSSEC-awareness.

**Source Port Randomization**
- **Test Methodology**: This test exercises the underlying Network Address Translation/Port Translation (NAT-PT) algorithms in the router/firewall.
- **Context**: Added in light of the DNS vulnerability announced by Dan Kaminsky on July 8th, 2008, and concerns about NAT-PT systems undermining source port randomization.
- **Test Execution**: We tested for UDP source port randomization by running a local recursive DNS resolver on the LAN side and using public port checker tests.
- **Results**: Half of the units tested had poor source port selection algorithms, often picking sequential UDP source ports.
- **Security Implications**: We will not disclose which units are affected until vendors have had the opportunity to resolve the issue. Consumers should update factory-default firmware to address this vulnerability, which could also improve DNSSEC support.

**General Observations**
- No router/firewall passed every single test. Six units passed every test except the TCP test, facilitating DNSSEC deployment.
- One firewall was transparent to DNSSEC because it does not proxy DNS. Only units that proxy DNS or inspect application layer content are likely to interfere with DNSSEC processing.
- All tested proxies appear to be DNS forwarders. "Simple" proxies that blindly copied AD/CD/DO flags fared well, while those that actively participated in DNS application processing were more impacted by DNSSEC.
- **Specific Issues**:
  - One proxy cached all SOA records, incorrectly serving later DNSSEC queries from its cache.
  - Another proxy generated UDP queries and then failed over to TCP for responses over 512 bytes, doubling the number of queries.
  - One firewall failed every proxy test by putting the upstream resolver's IP address on all response packets, causing clients to reject the responses.

**SOHO Firewalls**
- More feature diversity was found in SOHO firewalls compared to residential routers.
- Most SOHO firewalls required explicit configuration of DHCP and DNS settings and did not operate in proxy mode by default.
- Some SOHO firewalls provide deep packet inspection and/or application layer proxies, typically as "unified threat management" options. Testing showed that these features did not object to DNSSEC flags or RRs, though one generated "possible reconnaissance" alerts.

**Comparison with .SE Testing**
- Similar to .SE, we found near-total absence of TCP and many EDNS0 limitations.
- 27% of proxies could not convey the DNSSEC OK flag.
- Only two proxies blocked requests containing the AD flag.
- Fewer failure results were experienced because fewer tests were run over TCP or with expected responses > 512 bytes.

**Conclusions**
- All 24 units could successfully route DNSSEC queries directly to an upstream resolver.
- Most units operate as DNS proxies by default, almost always over UDP.
- **Combined Results**:
  - 4 proxies could retrieve DNSSEC-enabled responses up to 4096 bytes.
  - 6 proxies could only retrieve DNSSEC responses that fit in one IP packet.
  - 6 proxies could only retrieve DNSSEC responses that fit in one RFC1035 packet.
  - 6 proxies blocked "DNSSEC OK" requests and/or validated responses entirely.
