To mitigate the risk of unauthorized data access using stolen credentials, consider implementing IP allowlisting in conjunction with robust user account management. This approach ensures that data access is restricted not only to valid users but also to connections originating from expected IP ranges. By combining these measures, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful credential misuse.
