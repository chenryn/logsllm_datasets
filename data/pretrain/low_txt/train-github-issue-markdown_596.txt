I'm familiar with this functionality from KeyPirinha, thanks to a plugin. I would like to be able to perform actions such as sleep, restart, shut down, log off, and hibernate directly from PTR. While I could create separate programs for these tasks and place them in my start menu as a workaround, it seems more efficient and universally beneficial to integrate these features into PTR. This approach would (a) avoid bloating the runner and (b) provide a widely useful set of tools.
