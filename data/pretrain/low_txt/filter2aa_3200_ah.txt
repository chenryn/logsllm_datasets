### Missouri State Summary

**Interoperable Communications Initiatives:**
- **Statewide Interoperable Communication Plan:**
  - **Development:** The Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP) is developing a statewide interoperable communications plan under the direction of the Homeland Security Advisory Council (HSAC) and the State Interoperable Executive Committee (SIEC).
  - **Timeline:** The planning effort is expected to be completed by the end of FY2006.
  - **Regional Plans:** The baseline plan will serve as a foundation for developing Interoperable Communications Plans in the nine Missouri Homeland Security Regions.

- **Grants and Funding:**
  - Over the past two years, more than $13.7 million has been competitively awarded to local jurisdictions for improving and enhancing interoperable communications.
  - **Award Process:** A peer review committee, including SIEC members and other communication experts, reviewed and awarded funds to 347 jurisdictions across the state.
  - **Specific Grants:**
    - Independence, Missouri, and the City of St. Louis received grants for the installation of interoperable communication switches.

- **St. Louis Urban Area:**
  - **Swap (Cache) Radios System:** Maintains a cache of standby radios that can be deployed during regional incidents, allowing all responders to use a common, compatible set of radios.
  - **Shared Channels:** Common channels established within the region, programmed into radios to provide interoperable communications among agencies.
  - **Gateway System:** Interconnects channels from different systems (bands, modes, or proprietary platforms), enabling first responders to use their existing radios and channels to communicate with users outside their agency.

- **Kansas City Urban Area:**
  - **Regional Interoperability Committee:** Oversaw the preparation of an assessment and interoperable communications plan in 2004.
  - **Multi-Phase Regional Interoperability Plan:** Guides homeland security investments to enhance inter-agency coordination and communications.
