#### Potential Issues with Edge Selection
When using a limited number of sources and an end-to-end strategy, edges are often selected disproportionately. This can lead to bias when the edges incident to a node in the underlying graph are sampled unevenly. Consequently, an edge is more likely to be visible if it is close to the vantage point that discovered it.

To explore this issue, we analyze the CAIDA 2011 dataset, focusing on the discovered AS-links as the intersection of the number of probes that crossed through them versus the corresponding number of ALTPs (Alternative Traceroute Paths) that contain them. We concentrate on the top AS-link, which has the largest number of ALTPs, being seen by nearly 10,000 ALTPs and discovered by almost half a million probes. A closer inspection reveals that this link connects AS195 (San Diego Supercomputer Center) and AS2152 (California State University Network) at SD-NAP (an IXP located in San Diego, CA). All the probes responsible for discovering this link correspond to a CAIDA Ark monitor placed in the San Diego Supercomputer Center. Similar trends were observed for the other top three links. This highlights that the location of the vantage points can lead to erroneous inferences about a link’s popularity.

#### Conclusions and Future Work
We advance the state-of-the-art in traffic characterization by presenting a novel technique to infer traffic volumes from AS-level routing graphs carved out by massive traceroute campaigns. Our Network Syntax approach leverages the observation that the popularity of a route on the Internet can serve as an informative proxy for the volume of traffic it carries. Drawing analogies with city grids and traffic, Network Syntax applies structural analysis and metrics to predict with high accuracy the inter-domain traffic volume carried by different links.

We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach using two months of data (collected two years apart) from a Tier-1 Internet Service Provider and a large Internet eXchange Point, by identifying traffic-critical links and inferring missing traffic matrix measurements. We evaluated four different publicly available traceroute datasets but selected two for inclusion (due to space constraints), representing different standpoints with respect to type and location of vantage points. Multiple other datasets collected over the years could be leveraged by our technique, such as RIPE’s Atlas project [4] or those collected from the DIMES project [43].

Future research directions include specific methodological aspects (e.g., different metrics and dataset attributes) and applications of a better-understood flow of Internet traffic. For example, could we identify high-traffic links in the context of arbitrary AS-links on the Internet, i.e., establish the relative importance of a pair of AS-links not tied to a specific network? This could be used to augment existing AS-topology maps with the relative importance of links based on traffic carried. Could Network Syntax, perhaps in combination with existing techniques, be used to complete partial-traffic matrices? Given our new ability to leverage long-available traceroute datasets, what could this approach tell us about the variability and evolution of the Internet over time?
