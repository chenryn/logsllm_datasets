#### Both ASNs for These Two Organizations
To capture the full connectivity during the transition period, both ASNs of these two organizations were utilized as they shifted all their neighbors to their primary ASN. Figure 5 illustrates the IPv6 clique inferred using the enhanced clique inference method. This improved method infers more stable IPv6 cliques composed of transit-free ASes, reducing the average number of ASes entering or leaving the clique from 3.4 with the IPv4-focused method to 1.8 with our IPv6-focused method. This improvement brings the edit distance between temporally adjacent cliques closer to the IPv4 average of 1.5 ASes.

#### Inferring Clique-Stub Relationships
After inferring the clique, we apply the remaining steps in Algorithm 1 without modification until step 9, which infers stub ASes as customers of clique ASes, regardless of whether a clique AS is observed exporting a stub AS as a customer. In IPv4, this step avoids misinferring backup transit links as p2p and relies on the fact that no clique members have an open peering policy. Establishing backup transit links is a common strategy for IPv4 ASes to ensure reliable connectivity in the face of failures. However, backup transit links are less critical in IPv6 due to the low levels of traffic and the smaller size of the topology [8]. Therefore, we skip step 9 of the algorithm.

#### Validation
We evaluated the positive predictive value (PPV) of our improved algorithm, defined as the proportion of inferences of a particular type that were correct. Figure 6 shows the PPV over time according to our validation datasets described in Section 3.2. Our algorithm achieves high PPV throughout the inference period (January 2004–July 2014), with PPV for both p2c and p2p inferences consistently above 96% after spring 2009 for the communities and after fall 2012 for the RPSLng data. The PPV for inferences validated using the LocPref data is over 96% for the three points in time where we have LocPref data. The diversity of validation data sources and high PPV values strengthen our confidence in the suitability of our algorithm and the accuracy of our inferences. Figure 6 indicates that both p2c and p2p relationships are inferred with high PPV, except before 2006 when p2c inferences had a PPV of less than 80% for many BGP snapshots. However, our validation dataset (and the IPv6 AS topology) is considerably smaller (Fig. 1) prior to 2006.

#### Analysis
To avoid artifacts from inference errors on very small early topologies, we compare IPv6 and IPv4 routing relationships starting from 2006. Congruent relationships refer to dual-stack AS links with the same relationship type in both IPv4 and IPv6; disparate relationships are dual-stack links where the relationship differs. The fraction of disparate relationships decreases linearly over time (Fig. 7a), from 15% in 2006 to 5% in 2014, as congruent relationships increase in number faster than disparate ones, suggesting convergence.

Figure 7b shows the fraction of disparate relationships by type. Most inferred disparate relationships are p2c in IPv6 and p2p in IPv4, with the remaining disparate relationships being p2p in IPv6 and p2c in IPv4. Hurricane Electric (AS6939) contributes over 50% of the disparate IPv6 p2c/IPv4 p2p relationships after 2010, peaking in July 2014 when it contributed 87% of observed disparate relationships. These observations align with the behavior of the IPv6 tunnel broker service provided by Hurricane Electric, which allows free transit, enabling IPv4 peers to be IPv6 customers without cost [1]. This strategy allows Hurricane Electric to acquire many IPv6 (free-transit) customers compared to IPv4, as illustrated by comparing its IPv4 and IPv6 customer cones. The customer cone is defined as the ASes that an AS can reach by following a customer link (the AS’s customers, customers of those customers, and so on) and is a metric of influence in the transit market. Figure 8 compares the relative size of the customer cones between IPv4 and IPv6 over the last nine years for the nine largest providers as of July 2014. Hurricane Electric is the only AS with a significantly larger customer cone in IPv6 than in IPv4 (over 50% of IPv6 ASes). However, the relative sizes of customer cones of the largest providers show an increasing trend, in contrast with the trend observed in the IPv4 topology [18]. The only exception is Global Crossing (AS3549), which merged with Level3 (AS3356) in 2012.

#### Conclusion
The low level of IPv6 deployment has hindered efforts to accurately infer IPv6 AS relationships. We addressed this challenge by modifying CAIDA’s IPv4 relationship inference algorithm, focusing on the correct inference of the IPv6 clique. The clique is a crucial component of AS topology, but with fundamental disparities between IPv4 and IPv6, including the extreme peering openness of some IPv6 ASes and long-lived peering disputes among transit-free IPv6 networks. To overcome these obstacles, we used two new metrics to help filter out topological inconsistencies in IPv6: peering policy and BGP-observed reachability.

We validated ten years of our algorithm’s inferences against three data sources: BGP communities, RPSLng, and local preference values, which covered 25% of the BGP-observed topology for July 2014. Our inferences achieved an overall Positive Predictive Value of at least 96% for each dataset since 2009, with increasing accuracy over time. We found that dual-stack relationships are increasingly congruent, as disparate relationships decreased from 15% in 2006 to 5% in 2014, while the number of nodes and links increased by factors of 14.5 and 22, respectively. Notably, disparate relationships are now dominated by a single AS, Hurricane Electric, whose long-standing offer of free IPv6 transit has enabled it to become the dominant transit-free provider in IPv6, with the largest customer cone in the IPv6 topology, despite not even being a transit-free network in IPv4.
