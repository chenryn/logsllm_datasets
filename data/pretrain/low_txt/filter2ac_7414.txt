### Title: BlackHat EU-19: Unleashing the Power of My 20+ Year-Old Car

When I moved to Japan about a year and a half ago, one of my first priorities was to purchase a car. Having previously owned a ~70 horsepower family car, I decided to opt for something more powerful and acquired a 1990s sports car. Since then, I have been using it as my daily driver and for track days, accumulating over 50,000 kilometers. It has proven to be an excellent vehicle.

However, Japanese regulations mandate that manufacturers install speed limiters on their cars, capping the maximum speed at approximately 180 km/h. In this talk, I will share my journey in bypassing this speed limiter. I will discuss the methods I considered, the approach I ultimately took, and the discoveries I made along the way.

The presentation will cover the basics of automotive engine computer management, as well as some hardware and software reverse engineering techniques. I will also include video demonstrations to illustrate the process. This work was conducted for educational purposes, and all testing was performed legally on racetracks and closed roads.
