### Resetting Passwords for Multiple Users

1. **Select the User Accounts:**
   - To open a directory domain, click the small globe icon above the list of users and choose from the pop-up menu.
   - Command-click or Shift-click to select all user accounts whose passwords you want to reset.

2. **Authenticate as an Administrator:**
   - If you are setting the password type to Open Directory, authenticate as an administrator whose password type is also Open Directory.

3. **Set the New Password:**
   - Enter a new password on the Basic pane.
   - Set the User Password Type option on the Advanced pane.

4. **Save the Changes:**
   - Click Save to apply the new settings.

5. **Notify the Users:**
   - Inform the users of their temporary password so they can log in.
   - After logging in with the temporary password, users can change their password by clicking Accounts in System Preferences.

**Note:**
- If you change the password of accounts whose password type is Open Directory and the accounts reside in the LDAP directory of an Open Directory replica or master, the change will be synchronized with the master and all its replicas. Mac OS X Server automatically synchronizes changes to Open Directory passwords among a master and its replicas.

### Changing the Global Password Policy

Using Server Admin, you can set a global password policy for user accounts in a Mac OS X Server directory domain. This policy affects user accounts in the server’s local directory domain. If the server is an Open Directory master or replica, the policy also applies to the server’s LDAP directory domain. Changes to the global password policy on an Open Directory replica will eventually be synchronized with the master and any other replicas.

**Steps to Change the Global Password Policy:**

1. **Open Server Admin:**
   - Select Open Directory for a server in the Computers & Services list.

2. **Access Authentication Settings:**
   - Click Settings (near the bottom of the window), then click Authentication (near the top).

3. **Set the Password Policy Options:**
   - Configure the desired options for users who do not have their own individual password policies.
   - **Disable login on __**: Enter a date in mm/dd/yyyy format; for example, 02/22/2005.
   - **Password must be changed every __**: Note that some service protocols, such as IMAP mail service and Windows file service, do not allow users to change their passwords.

4. **Save the Changes:**
   - Click Save to apply the new policy.

**Note:**
- Replicas of the Open Directory master automatically inherit its global password policy.

### Enabling LDAP Bind Authentication for a User

You can use Workgroup Manager to enable the use of LDAP bind authentication for a user account stored in an LDAP directory domain. When you use this password validation technique, you rely on the LDAP server that contains the user account to authenticate the user’s password.

**Steps to Enable LDAP Bind User Authentication:**

1. **Ensure Proper Configuration:**
   - Make sure the account for a user whose password you want to validate using LDAP bind resides on an LDAP server in the search path of the Mac OS X computer that needs to validate the password.
   - See “Accessing LDAP Directories” on page 90 for information about configuring LDAP server connections. Avoid mapping the password attribute when configuring the connection; bind authentication will occur automatically. Also, set up the connection to use SSL to protect the password while it is in transit.

2. **Open the User Account:**
   - In Workgroup Manager, click the Accounts button, then click the Users button.
   - Click the small globe icon above the list of users and choose from the pop-up menu to open the LDAP directory domain where the user’s account resides.
   - Click the lock and authenticate as a directory domain administrator.
   - Select the user in the user list.

3. **Set the Password Type:**
   - On the Advanced pane, choose “Crypt password” from the User Password Type pop-up menu.

4. **Clear the Password Field:**
   - On the Basic pane, make sure the Password field is empty.

5. **Save the Changes:**
   - Click Save to apply the new settings.

### Assigning Administrator Rights for Open Directory Authentication

You can work with Open Directory authentication settings in Workgroup Manager only if you authenticate as an administrator of the directory domain that contains the user accounts you want to work with. The administrator must use Open Directory authentication. These restrictions protect the security of passwords stored in the Kerberos KDC and the Open Directory Password Server database.

**Note:**
- Do not use the Options button on the Advanced pane to set up password policies for directory domain administrators. Password policies are not enforced for administrator accounts. Directory domain administrators need to be able to change password policies of individual user accounts.

---

### Exporting and Importing Users Whose Password Type Is Open Directory

When you export user accounts whose password type is set to Open Directory, passwords are not exported. This protects the security of the Open Directory Password Server database. Before importing, you can use a spreadsheet application to preset passwords, which users can change the next time they log in.

**Options for Setting Imported User Passwords:**

- **Temporary Password:** Set all imported user accounts to use a temporary password, which each user can change the next time they log in. See “Resetting the Passwords of Multiple Users” on page 73.
- **Individual Passwords:** Set the password of each imported user account individually on the Basic pane of Workgroup Manager. See “Changing a User’s Password Type” on page 76.

---

### Exporting and Importing Authentication Manager Users

When you export user accounts that have crypt passwords from a NetInfo domain for which Authentication Manager is enabled, passwords are not exported. After importing to a directory domain of Mac OS X Server version 10.3, you have the following options for setting the passwords of the imported user accounts:

- **Temporary Password:** Set all imported user accounts to use a temporary password, which each user can change the next time they log in. See “Resetting the Passwords of Multiple Users” on page 73.
- **Individual Passwords:** Set the password of each imported user account individually on the Basic pane of Workgroup Manager. See “Changing a User’s Password Type” on page 76.

**Note:**
- Authentication Manager is a legacy technology for securely validating passwords. It only works with user accounts created in a NetInfo domain of Mac OS X Server version 10.0–10.2. For more information, see Appendix C, “Authentication Manager.”

---

### Migrating Passwords to Open Directory Authentication

User accounts can be migrated from earlier versions of Mac OS X Server by importing the account records or upgrading the server where they reside. User accounts created with Mac OS X Server version 10.1 or earlier have no authentication authority attribute but do have crypt passwords. For compatibility with such user accounts, Mac OS X Server version 10.2 and later assumes a user account without an authentication authority attribute has a crypt password.

**Migrating User Accounts:**

- **Importing User Accounts:** If you import user accounts from Mac OS X Server version 10.1 or earlier, the user accounts have no authentication authority attribute and are initially configured to have crypt passwords. You can change the user accounts to use Open Directory authentication using Workgroup Manager.
- **Upgrading the Server:** If you upgrade from Mac OS X Server version 10.1 or earlier, user accounts created before upgrading have no authentication authority attribute and are assumed to have crypt passwords after upgrading.

**Options for Migrating Authentication Manager Users:**

- **Upgrade First:** If you upgrade the server version first from Mac OS X Server version 10.1 to version 10.2 and then to version 10.3, existing users can continue to use their same passwords.
- **Change to Open Directory:** You can change some or all upgraded user accounts to use Open Directory authentication, which is the preferred option for authenticating Windows users. Users of both types can coexist in the same directory domain.
- **Importing with Conversion:** If you import user accounts that use Authentication Manager, they will be converted to Open Directory authentication during the import process.
