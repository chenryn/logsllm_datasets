  - Version 6.11 (November 2011)
  - Version 6.3 (August 2011)

- **Accuracy:**
  - 24 samples in 10 known families from contagio.
  - DroidRanger detected 23 samples (96%).
  - Missed a payload of DroidDream, not the malware itself.
  - Found one mis-categorized sample for ADRD.

#### Heuristics-Based Detection Engine
- **App Repository:**
  - Malware Samples
  - Permission-based Behavioral Footprints
  - Footprint-based Detection Engine
  - Infection from Known Malware
  - Heuristics-based Detection Engine
  - Infection from Zero-day Malware

- **Detected:**
  - Two zero-day malware using heuristics:
    - **Plankton:** Dynamic loading of Java code.
    - **DroidKungFu:** Dynamic loading of native code.
  - 40 samples using behavioral footprints:
    - 11 samples from the official Android Market.
    - 29 samples from alternative Android Markets.

#### Malware Behaviors
- **Plankton:**
  - Uploads a list of permissions before downloading a payload.
  - Contains a bot-like command & control channel.

- **DroidKungFu:**
  - Contains two encrypted root exploits.
  - Installs a payload app mimicking Google Search.

#### Discussion
- **Need for More Comprehensive Heuristics:**
  - Background sending of unauthorized SMS messages?
  - Bot-like behavior controlled by SMS messages?
  - Call for rigorous vetting processes.
  - Large number of users can be infected.
  - Malware remains in alternative markets for a long time.
  - Zero-day malware exists in Android Markets.
