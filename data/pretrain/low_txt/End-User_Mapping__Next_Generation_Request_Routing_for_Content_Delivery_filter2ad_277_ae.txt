(b) Number of /x client IP blocks with non-zero demand.

**Figure 22: A smaller value of x yields fewer mapping units but larger cluster radius, resulting in lower mapping accuracy.**

To optimize end-user mapping, IP blocks (i.e., CIDRs) from BGP feeds are used as the units for routing in the Internet. If a set of /24 IP blocks belong to the same BGP CIDR, they can be combined, as they are likely proximal in the network. We extracted 517,000 unique CIDRs with non-zero traffic from BGP feeds across the Internet. By combining /24 IP blocks within the same BGP CIDR, the number of mapping units was reduced from 3.76 million to 444,000. This technique can be applied to reduce the number of mapping units for /x IP blocks, for any value of x.

After applying BGP CIDRs to reduce the number of mapping units, there is still a trade-off in choosing /x client IP blocks as the mapping unit. Using coarser /x client IP blocks (i.e., a smaller value of x) reduces the number of mapping units. However, this increases the geographical span of each block, leading to a larger cluster radius and reduced mapping accuracy. Figure 22 illustrates the trade-off between the cluster radius (a proxy for mapping accuracy) and the number of clusters that need to be measured and analyzed. It shows that /20 client IP blocks are a good option, reducing the number of mapping units by a factor of 3 compared to /24 blocks, while 87.3% of the clusters have a radius of no more than 100 miles.

### 5.2 Dealing with Greater DNS Query Rates

In NS-based mapping, each LDNS stores one resolution per domain name. In end-user mapping, different client IP blocks within the same client cluster may receive different resolutions for the same domain name. Therefore, an LDNS serving multiple client IP blocks may store multiple entries for the same domain name, leading to multiple requests to the authoritative name server. This can cause a sharp increase in the DNS queries seen by the authoritative name servers of the mapping system. Figure 23 shows the total DNS queries per second served by the mapping system before, during, and after enabling end-user mapping for clients using public resolvers. Before the roll-out, Akamai's name servers handled 870,000 queries per second, with public resolvers accounting for approximately 33,500 queries per second. After the roll-out, the total queries per second on the Akamai network increased to 1.17 million, with public resolvers contributing 270,000 queries per second. Thus, the queries from public resolvers increased by a factor of 8, largely due to the roll-out. The gradual increase in query rate outside the roll-out window is attributed to the normal growth in Internet traffic over time.

**Figure 23: DNS queries received by Akamai’s name servers from LDNSes showed a significant increase during the end-user mapping rollout.**

### 5.3 Impact on Domain Name and LDNS Pairs

The popularity of a domain name among the clients of an LDNS influences the increase in DNS queries when EDNS0 and end-user mapping are enabled. Before the roll-out, the query rate for a domain name from a particular LDNS was at most one query per TTL, as the LDNS could cache the translation for the duration of the TTL. We categorized each domain name and LDNS pair based on the number of queries received per TTL before the roll-out. Figure 24 shows the increase in query rate for domain name and LDNS pairs in each category. More popular domain name and LDNS pairs, which had pre-roll-out query rates close to 1 query per TTL, saw the largest increase in query rate when end-user mapping was rolled out. Less popular domains saw little or no increase. This is because a more popular domain name is more likely to be accessed by clients in multiple client IP blocks of the LDNS’s client cluster, each requiring a separate domain name resolution when EDNS0 is used. Fortunately, the domain name and LDNS pairs in the highest popularity bucket in Figure 24 accounted for only 11% of total pre-roll-out queries.

**Figure 24: More popular domain name and LDNS pairs show a greater increase in query rate after the roll-out.**

### 6. Role of Server Deployments

Server deployments play a crucial role in determining client performance. More deployment locations mean better performance for clients, as the mapping system has more options to choose a proximal server for each client. However, what role do deployments play in determining the additional performance benefits provided by end-user mapping over NS-based mapping? Should a CDN with a small number of deployment locations adopt end-user mapping? For a given set of deployment locations, is it more beneficial to add more deployment locations or to incorporate end-user mapping? How much can NS-based mapping be improved by making it client-aware?

To provide insight into these key questions, consider a simplified model. Let a CDN have N deployment locations. These deployments partition the IP address space of the global Internet into sets Ei, where Ei is the set of IPs for which the ith deployment location is the most proximal. If a client c and its LDNS are both in some set Ei, both end-user mapping and traditional NS-based mapping will pick a server in the ith deployment location for client c, providing no additional benefit. Thus, a CDN with fewer deployments will have larger sets Ei, making it less likely to benefit from end-user mapping. We quantify answers to these and other key questions using simulations.

**Simulation Methodology:**
- **Universe U:** 2,642 different locations around the globe with Akamai servers, spread over 100 countries.
- **IP Blocks:** Around 20,000 /24 IP blocks, clustered into 8,000 "ping targets" covering major geographical areas and networks.
- **Latency Measurements:** Latency measurements from each deployment to each ping target, using the closest ping target as a proxy for latency to the client or LDNS.

We simulated three mapping schemes:
1. **NS-based Mapping (NS):** Map client to the deployment location with the least latency to the LDNS.
2. **End-user Mapping (EU):** Map client to the deployment location with the least latency to the client’s /24 IP block.
3. **Client-Aware NS-based Mapping (CANS):** For each client, find the cluster of clients sharing its LDNS and map the client to the deployment location that minimizes the traffic-weighted average of the latencies from the deployment to its cluster of clients.

CANS is an enhancement of pure NS mapping by using latency measurements to the clients of the LDNS, rather than just the LDNS. It requires tracking client-LDNS associations, adding complexity. CANS can be viewed as a hybrid between NS and EU, using client measurements without requiring specific knowledge about the client’s IP.

We simulated the three mapping schemes for varying numbers of deployment locations N chosen from the universe U. We performed 100 random runs, randomly ordering the deployments and simulating all three schemes for the first N deployments. The simulation computes the traffic-weighted mean, 95th, and 99th percentile latencies achieved by the three schemes. Finally, for each value of N, we averaged the metrics obtained across the 100 simulation runs, as shown in Figure 25.

**Figure 25: Latencies achieved by EU, CANS, and NS mapping as a function of CDN deployment locations.**

An important caveat in interpreting Figure 25 is that the ping latencies shown are underestimates of the actual latency or RTT from the server to the client, as only a ping target (typically a router) en route to the client is "pinged." While the absolute values of the ping latencies are less meaningful except as a lower bound on the actual latencies, the relative values are still meaningful. All mapping schemes provide smaller ping latencies with a larger deployment. The mean ping latency is nearly identical for all three schemes, reflecting that in many cases, a client and its LDNS are proximal. EU performed the best, with mean ping latency dropping from 35 ms for a small deployment to under 10 ms as the deployments increase.

However, the mean latency across all clients is less interesting than the latency of the worst-performing clients. CDNs and content providers focus on improving the performance of the worst-performing clients. We computed the 95th and 99th percentiles of the latencies. EU provides a large benefit over the other schemes for higher percentiles of ping latency. NS-based mapping provides diminishing benefits beyond 160 deployment locations for the 99th percentile latency and cannot reduce it below 186 ms even with 1,280 deployment locations. EU continues to reduce latencies with increasing deployments, even beyond 1,280. A CDN with larger deployment locations sees a proportionally larger reduction in higher percentiles of ping latency by switching to EU from NS. CANS provides an intermediate point between NS and EU, using the knowledge of latencies to clients.

### 7. Related Work

While the EDNS0 extension provides a systematic mechanism for end-user mapping implementation, other mechanisms have been explored in limited ways in industry. For example, a video CDN at Akamai in circa 2000 used metafile redirection to implement end-user mapping. When a client starts a video, the media player fetches a metafile containing the server’s IP. The server IP in the metafile is dynamically generated by the mapping system using the client’s IP. However, such a mechanism is hard to extend to the Web and other traffic that do not use metafiles. Systems using HTTP redirection have also been built, where the client is first assigned a server using NS-based mapping. The first server then redirects the client to a "better" second server if appropriate. However, this process incurs a redirection penalty, acceptable only for larger downloads like media files and software.

Tools for discovering client-LDNS pairings have existed in the industry for the past 15 years. Such pairings can be used to create a client-aware NS-based mapping system, though it is less effective for LDNSes with large client clusters. The EDNS0 extension is key to building large-scale end-user mapping, removing the overhead of explicit client-LDNS discovery, avoiding a redirection performance penalty, and being effective even for LDNSes with large geo-distributed client clusters.

From a research perspective, client-LDNS distances and their impact on server selection have been studied. Prior literature observed larger client-LDNS distances and poorer performance for clients using public resolvers. Our measurement study of client-LDNS distances, based on a wider global cross-section of clients and LDNSes, confirms prior conclusions on public resolvers. We go further by describing an end-user mapping system to remedy the issue. The EDNS0 extension has also been studied as a tool for figuring out deployments of CDN providers who support the extension, such as Google.

### 8. Conclusion

In this paper, we described our experience in rolling out a new mapping system called end-user mapping. By analyzing clients and LDNSes from around the world, we showed that a significant fraction of clients have LDNSes that are not in their proximity and could benefit from end-user mapping. We confirmed the performance benefits by measuring mapping distance, RTT, Time-To-First-Byte (TTFB), and content download time during the roll-out. For "high-expectation" countries, clients using public resolvers saw an eight-fold decrease in mean mapping distance, a two-fold decrease in RTT and content download time, and a 30% improvement in TTFB. We also quantified the scaling challenges in implementing end-user mapping, such as the eight-fold increase in DNS queries and the greater number of mapping units that need to be measured and analyzed. Finally, we shed light on the role of deployments and showed that a CDN with a larger number of deployment locations is likely to benefit more from end-user mapping than a CDN with a smaller number. While we only describe the roll-out of end-user mapping to clients using public resolvers, our analysis shows that a broad roll-out of this technology across the entire Internet population will be quite beneficial. For such a roll-out to occur, more ISPs would need to support the EDNS0 extension. We expect our work, which quantifies the real-world benefits of end-user mapping, to provide impetus for a broader adoption of the EDNS0 extension.
