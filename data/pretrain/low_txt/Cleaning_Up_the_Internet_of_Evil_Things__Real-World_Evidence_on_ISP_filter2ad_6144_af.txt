### Clearly Highly Effective, Future Work Will Have to Resolve These Remaining Mysteries

At first glance, the implications of our study for industry seem clear. First, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) play a critical role, as more than 87% of the infections reside within their networks. Second, walled garden notifications are effective and feasible, although the current usability of the notifications and cleanup advice is rather poor. Third, since walled gardens are recognized as a best practice for mitigating 'regular' botnets by ISPs, we can leverage existing mitigation structures and practices to also address IoT botnets, avoiding the need to establish new organizational structures and agreements.

However, there is a significant caveat. The economic incentives for ISPs to adopt walled garden solutions are weak, as evidenced by the fact that only a fraction of ISPs currently have them. Setting up and operating a walled garden, or any effective abuse management process, is a cost center for ISPs. Additionally, the fear of customer pushback further erodes these incentives. Our analysis of customer experiences revealed a small but vocal minority who were angry or frustrated. Given the high cost of customer acquisition in these saturated markets, this fear might be enough to dissuade ISPs from quarantining infections. Overcoming this incentive problem may require governmental measures to assign intermediate liability to ISPs. Soft versions of such measures, such as a "duty of care," already exist in many jurisdictions [10], [30].

While calling upon ISPs to take on this task, we can emphasize that their actions will have a much higher chance of success compared to educating millions of end users about IoT security. Furthermore, a non-trivial portion of customers was pleased to be notified via the walled garden. As more people become aware of the threats to their IoT devices, ISP mitigation might become more accepted—or even expected.

### Standard Walled Garden Notification Content
**APPENDIX A**

**Secure Environment**
A safe Internet is in everyone's interest. We strongly care about protecting your (confidential) information.

We have received information from one of our partners that a security issue has been detected on your Internet connection. You probably have not noticed anything yet.

Don't worry. To protect you against the security risks, we have placed your Internet connection in our secure environment. In this environment, you can safely solve the security issues. We are willing to help you to do so.

**What is the problem and how can you solve it?**
One or more Internet-connected devices in your home have been infected with the Mirai virus. We cannot detect which Internet-connected device has been infected. Most likely, it is a digital video recorder (DVR), security camera, or a printer connected to the Internet, rather than a computer, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone.

**Steps to remove the Mirai virus and prevent future infections:**
1. Determine which devices are connected to your Internet connection. Reminder: The Mirai virus mainly infects Internet-connected devices such as a DVR, security camera, or printer.
2. Change the password of the Internet-connected devices. Choose a password that is hard to guess. If you do not know the current password, please refer to the manual.
3. Restart the Internet-connected devices by turning them off and on again. This will remove the Mirai virus from the memory of the devices.
4. Reset your modem/router to the factory settings. Instructions for an Experia Box can be found at https://address.com.
5. Set a strong password for your modem/router. Instructions for an Experia Box can be found at https://address.com.

**Warning!** If remote access to a certain device is absolutely necessary, manually define port forwards in your router for this device. Instructions for an Experia Box can be found at https://address.com.

**Necessary steps:**
1. Take the measures stated above.
2. Fill in our form (and restore your Internet connection).

**General security tips:**
* Use an up-to-date virus scanner to keep out potential hazards.
* Keep computer software, like your operating system, up to date.
* Do not open messages and unknown files that you do not expect or trust.
* Secure your wireless connection with a unique and strong password.

### Improved Walled Garden Notification Content
**APPENDIX B**

**Secure Environment**
A safe Internet is in everyone's interest. We strongly care about protecting your (confidential) information.

We have received information from one of our partners that a security issue has been detected on your Internet connection. You probably have not noticed anything yet.

Don't worry. To protect you against the security risks, we have placed your Internet connection in our secure environment. In this environment, you can safely solve the security issues. We are willing to help you to do so.

**What is the problem and how can you solve it?**
One or more devices connected to your Internet connection are infected with the Mirai virus. This virus targets devices that use your Internet connection independently, such as IP cameras or digital TV decoders.

The infection likely occurred due to the use of a standard password and username combination to access the device.

**Steps to solve the problem:**
1. Reset all your devices to factory defaults.
2. After the reset, change all the passwords for accessing the devices to strong passwords.
3. If the device can be reached by Telnet or SSH, also change these passwords.

**Necessary steps:**
1. Take the measures stated above.
2. Fill in our form (and restore your Internet connection).

**General security tips:**
* Use an up-to-date virus scanner to keep out potential hazards.
* Keep computer software, like your operating system, up to date.
