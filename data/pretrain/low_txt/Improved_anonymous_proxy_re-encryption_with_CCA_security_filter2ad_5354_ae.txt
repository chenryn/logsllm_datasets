### Secure Email Forwarding Process

The process of secure email forwarding typically involves the following steps:

1. **Email Encryption and Transmission**:
   - Alice sends an encrypted email to Bob. The email body, and optionally any attachments, are encrypted using the email client (Step 1).

2. **Server Processing**:
   - Upon receiving the email, the email server uploads the encrypted email body to a specified S3 URL (s3-url2) (Step 2).
   - The email server then invokes a proxy service via the API `ReEnc(rk, s3-url2, s3-url1)`, providing a re-encryption key (`rk`). This ensures that the re-encrypted email can be decrypted by Carol (Step 3).

3. **Proxy Service Operations**:
   - The proxy service parses the re-encryption key, fetches the second-level ciphertexts from the S3 location specified by `s3-url2`.
   - It performs the re-encryption, writes the re-encrypted ciphertexts to the location specified by `s3-url1`, and returns an HTTP OK response to the email server (Step 4).

4. **Final Delivery**:
   - The email server sends the final re-encrypted email to Carol, stored at the location specified by `s3-url1` (Step 5).
   - Carol decrypts and reads the email using her email client (Step 6).

### System Components and Extensions

- **Email Client**: We use the open-source Hastymail [3], which is written in PHP. We extend Hastymail with three important plugins:
  - **Encryption Plugin**: Encrypts the email before it is sent.
  - **Decryption Plugin**: Decrypts the encrypted emails (before or after re-encryption) downloaded from S3.
  - **Key Management Plugin**: Manages encryption and decryption keys.

- **Email Server**: We use Apache JAMES [2] as the email server. It is responsible for uploading incoming email objects to S3, invoking the proxy service, and sending (or broadcasting) the forwarded emails to the appropriate receivers.

### Security and Anonymity

- **Anonymity**: The cloud cannot infer any identity information due to the anonymous property in our Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) scheme. Therefore, the identities of the re-encryption participants are kept private.

### Experimental Evaluation

We evaluate the system performance using two different Amazon EC2 instances:

- **Small Instance**: One core CPU (1 ECU) and 1.7GB memory.
- **Medium Instance**: Two core CPUs (5 ECUs) and 1.7GB memory.

In particular, we are interested in the execution time of the re-encryption operation by the proxy service. We simulate a scenario where the proxy service receives 1,000 re-encryption requests simultaneously from the email server. The sizes of the plaintext emails are 8KB, 32KB, and 128KB, respectively, which are typical for real-world emails.

- **Performance Metrics**: We measure the execution time by the proxy service, including downloading second-level ciphertexts from S3, performing re-encryption operations, and uploading first-level ciphertexts to S3.

- **Results**:
  - For a Medium Instance, an 8KB email can be re-encrypted in approximately 2.3 seconds, and a 128KB email in about 40 seconds.
  - The computation capability positively influences the re-encryption operations: the Medium Instance outperforms the Small Instance in terms of re-encryption time.

### Security Properties

- **Trust Reduction**: Our anonymous PRE scheme reduces the trust required in the cloud for email forwarding, making it ideal for large-volume email sending, such as group email distribution.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Incoming emails are encrypted with a user's (or organization's) public key. The cloud-based proxy service cannot access the encrypted content without the corresponding private key, which is stored in an isolated domain (Hastymail in our case).
- **Local Key Management**: Users' private keys are maintained locally, and re-encryption keys are generated outside the cloud, ensuring that the cloud does not have access to sensitive key material.

### Related Work

- **Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE)**: The cryptographic primitive of PRE was formalized in [8] and has become an essential building block for many cryptographic solutions [6, 10, 11, 23, 24].
- **Anonymity and CCA Security**: Various features of PRE have been investigated, including anonymity [5], CCA security [9, 17], efficient construction [12], and conditional re-encryption [21].

### Conclusion

We address the identity privacy problem in proxy re-encryption, particularly when cloud users outsource re-encryption operations to public clouds. We propose a new anonymity notion and present an efficient construction that achieves both anonymity and CCA security in the random oracle model. We implement and deploy our scheme in Amazon Web Services, developing a prototype for secure email forwarding with anonymous re-encryption. Our evaluation shows that the performance is acceptable for many web-based applications. Future work includes designing anonymous and CCA-secure PRE in the standard model.
