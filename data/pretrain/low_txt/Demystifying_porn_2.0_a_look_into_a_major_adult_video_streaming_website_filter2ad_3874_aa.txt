## ABSTRACT

The Internet has evolved into a huge video delivery infrastructure, with websites such as YouTube and Netflix appearing at the top of most traffic measurement studies. However, most traffic studies have largely kept silent about an area of the Internet that (even today) is poorly understood: adult media distribution. Whereas ten years ago, such services were provided primarily via peer-to-peer file sharing and bespoke websites, recently these have converged towards what is known as "Porn 2.0". These popular web portals allow users to upload, view, rate and comment videos for free. Despite this, we still lack even a basic understanding of how users interact with these services. This paper seeks to address this gap by performing the first large-scale measurement study of one of the most popular Porn 2.0 websites: YouPorn. We have repeatedly crawled the website to collect statistics about 183k videos, witnessing over 60 billion views. Through this, we offer the first characterisation of this type of corpus, highlighting the nature of YouPorn's repository. We also inspect the popularity of objects and how they relate to other features such as the categories to which they belong. We find evidence for a high level of flexibility in the interests of its user base, manifested in the extremely rapid decay of content popularity over time, as well as high susceptibility to browsing order. Using a small-scale user study, we validate some of our findings and explore the infrastructure design and management implications of our observations.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

The Internet has evolved from a largely web-oriented infrastructure to a massively distributed content delivery system [27]. Video content is particularly popular: by 2016, 86% of all Internet traffic is predicted to be video [5]. This transformation has led to a multitude of research attempts to characterise key video portals and the corresponding changing consumption patterns. This includes seminal studies into user-generated content (UGC) [13], video on demand (VoD) [40], Internet TV (IPTV) [14] and catch-up TV [6, 29]. Thanks to them, our knowledge has been expanded and, in many cases, the infrastructures improved.

However, there is an elephant in the room: adult video distribution. Similar to other kinds of content, adult video consumption has been undergoing dramatic shifts. Traditionally, adult videos were distributed via pay-per-view websites and within peer-to-peer communities (e.g., one estimate found that pornography constitutes up to 18% of the files on eDonkey in some regions [35]). Recently, however, increasing amounts of traffic are being generated by emerging YouTube-like websites that provide free on-demand access to adult videos. These sites term themselves "Porn 2.0", and give users the ability to upload, view, rank and comment on videos, as well as form online profiles.

Next to nothing is known about the nature of Porn 2.0, nor the way users interact with it; little is even known (outside ISPs) about the actual amount of traffic generated by these sites. Despite this, its prominence in the Alexa rankings [1] is undeniable, with six adult websites listed in the top 100, more than any other genre of video streaming. We confirm the huge scale of adult content in this paper, where we find over 111 million requests to a single adult website in just a three day period. Considering this scale and prominence, we believe it crucial to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of Porn 2.0, and derive principles that could mitigate its impact on the network.

In this paper, we inspect one of the most popular Porn 2.0 websites: YouPorn [2]. Founded in 2006, it has quickly risen to global prominence. For the last 5 years, it has been amongst the most highly ranked sites listed in Alexa, consistently appearing in the top 100. Due to its large scale, YouPorn provides an ideal case study of the Internet's expanding adult video market.

We repeatedly crawled the YouPorn website to extract information about the videos being created and watched. The entire corpus consists of 183k videos, consisting of footage spanning in excess of 3 years. Over their lifetime, these videos collected more than 60 billion views, confirming YouPorn's huge popularity. In the last 7 days of the traces alone, 912 new videos were added and viewed over 38 million times.

Using this data, we characterise the corpus, highlighting how users interact with various aspects of the system. Further, we make a number of observations that provide evidence of its specific properties compared to other types of media. Because our data does not provide information about users' personal intentions, we further augment our data with a small scale user study (46 participants) to reflect upon the reasons behind our findings.

One running theme in many of our findings is that despite being consciously constructed as an adult site comparable to YouTube, YouPorn differs from traditional UGC sites (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo) in two key ways. First, the number of user-driven content uploads on YouPorn is comparatively low. Indeed, YouPorn itself has uploaded 36% of the overall corpus. Second, despite the lower number of videos, each video gets many more views, on average, than more mainstream UGC sites. This smaller, more popular content corpus suggests lower operating costs for such websites.

Another theme is that users appear to be flexible about which videos they consume. Whilst we verify this independently using a small scale user study, our dataset reveals that this user flexibility manifests itself in two unexpected ways, both of which point to the importance of helping users to locate content. First, although adult video content is not expected to age with time, unlike temporally-sensitive genres such as news or weather, most of the views are garnered in the first days after upload. We demonstrate that browsing order is a strong factor that affects the number of views obtained: easy to find videos collect most views. Second, we find that the number of categories a video appears in strongly correlates with the number of views it obtains. Videos which are not categorised suffer severely. We also discover that no attempt is made by YouPorn at engineering the content of individual categories: in many cases, highly populated categories have too few videos.

A list of contributions and paper roadmap follows:

1. We offer, to the best of our knowledge, the first large-scale measurement study into so-called "Porn 2.0" adult video distribution on the Internet. We present our dataset in Section 3 consisting of over 60 billion views. We will make the data publicly available.

2. We provide a detailed analysis of key characteristics of adult video content (Section 4), as well as the way in which users interact with this type of corpus and its various categories (Sections 5 and 6).

3. We explore the reasons behind our findings through discussions fuelled by a user study (Section 7). Using this, we explore potential improvements that would benefit both network operators and content providers.

## 2. RELATED WORK

Pornography is anecdotally the most searched for content on the Internet. Many theories exist to explain this. Cooper [16] attributes this to the Internet's "triple-A-engine": Accessibility, Affordability, Anonymity. Suler [36] expands this into 6 factors, coined as the online disinhibition effect. Whereas, much work has gone into looking at who engages in online sexual activities and why they do so [12, 20], little is known about about the actual engines that underpin its distribution, especially the expanding Porn 2.0 phenomenon. This has seen websites emerging (e.g., YouPorn [2]) that allow users to upload, view, rate and comment on videos for free, much like YouTube does.

**Table 1: Overview of datasets.**

A few studies have provided estimates of the demand handled by these websites. For example, Ogas and Gaddam [30] mention that Porn 2.0 sites such as Pornhub, RedTube, xHamster and YouPorn can gain up to 16 million views per month. This is a very conservative estimate compared to YouPorn's report of 100 million page views a day [3]. Other estimates have suggested that sites like YouPorn have a peak traffic rate of 800 Gbps [7]. Despite all this evidence, we still have quite a rudimentary understanding of the true scale of these services. Regardless, most experts agree that Porn 2.0 is a huge emerging economy that is not, as of yet, fully understood [17, 9, 21, 39, 30].

With this in mind, it is surprising to find next to nothing reported on the (systems-level) nature and operation of online adult multimedia delivery services. Instead, various research communities have focussed on specific sub-components such as automated recognition and classification [28, 25]; pornographic practices, communities and subcultures [9]; interest recommendations [34]; security issues [39]; and illegal content dissemination [26]. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first large-scale systems-perspective study of an online adult multimedia delivery service. We believe this work to be crucial, considering the increasing prominence of video distribution [5], of which adult media will likely continue to make up a significant proportion in the future [35]. That said, there are a multitude of studies into more traditional video streaming systems that already provide some insight. These include catch-up TV [6, 29], user generated content [13, 41], VoD [40] and IPTV [14, 22, 24]. Studies such as these have provided a range of insights, including content popularity models [23], optimised caching techniques [6] and improved delivery schemes [8]. As of yet, however, we are unaware as to how these principles apply to adult media systems. The rest of this paper therefore explores this topic.

Note that we do not make a sociological statement within our work; nor do we espouse the proliferation of pornographic media. We are interested in such media's impact on the network and, as such, we believe it is important to gain a better understanding of its characteristics.

## 3. YOUPORN DATASET

We crawled the YouPorn website to obtain information about its corpus and user base. Each video offered is accompanied by metadata that we extract. This metadata includes the number of views, the video rating, the number of ratings received, the upload date, the user who uploaded the video, the number of comments, and any categorical information. To collect this information, we performed a number of separate crawls, embodied within three datasets, summarised in Table 1.

Our first dataset, which we term the snapshot trace, contains information about all videos in the corpus (183,639), collected on the 28/02/2013. We observe over 60 billion views of videos with durations collectively spanning in excess of 3 years. To augment this, we also collected a second dataset, which we term the 3 day trace. To obtain it, we re-crawled the same videos 3 days later (3/03/2013). It contained 183,591 videos, 48 having been removed. Using the 3 day trace, we calculated the evolution of all quantitative metadata including popularity.

The mentioned traces provide two "snapshots" of all videos on YouPorn. This, however, does not give much insight into the temporal properties of individual videos. We have therefore also performed smaller-scale periodic crawlings to collect a time series of snapshots. The third dataset, which we term daily, traced 2172 videos added between the period of 1/03/2013 – 4/05/2013. For each video added, we retrieved all metadata on a daily basis to study how it evolved, offering insights into the lifetime of each video. From the full set, we filtered the entries to leave only complete videos in which we had in excess of 21 days recorded. This left 1656 videos with an accumulated set of 96 million views.

## 4. CHARACTERISING CONTENT CORPUS

In this section, we investigate the content corpus offered by YouPorn. We traced 183,639 videos within the corpus dating from September 2006. This constitutes their entire video repository, as available at the time of writing.

### 4.1 Content duration

First, we inspect the duration of videos within YouPorn, presented as a cumulative distribution function (CDF) in Figure 1. We observe from Figure 1 that most videos are rather short. About 80% are shorter than 15 minutes, with a very small fraction of them exceeding 45 minutes. If we divide them into 1 minute time ranges, the largest bucket is the 5–6 minutes, which contains 25% of all videos. This propensity could have emerged for a number of reasons. An obvious one is the presence of commercial videos that are intended to advertise content from other (e.g., pay-based) websites. Such users tend to upload short previews of longer videos in an attempt to entice users to their websites. YouPorn allows banners to be placed below videos to better enable this. It also appears that many other videos only contain relatively short scenes, without the sorts of preambles seen in other media types. Practically speaking, the corpus therefore appears very much like a convenient "pick and mix" repository where users can select snippets of videos that suit their interests rather than watching entire films. Whereas the reason...
