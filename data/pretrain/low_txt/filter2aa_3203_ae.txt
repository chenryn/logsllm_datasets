### Resolving NetBIOS Names to IPv4 Addresses

The Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS) resolves names to IPv4 addresses. A sample Lmhosts file (Lmhosts.sam) is included by default. You can create a new file named Lmhosts, or you can rename or copy Lmhosts.sam to Lmhosts in the appropriate folder. For more information, see Chapter 11, "NetBIOS over TCP/IP."

### Resolving Network Names to IPv4 Address Prefixes

Networks resolve network names to IPv4 address prefixes.

### Resolving Protocol Names to RFC-Defined Protocol Numbers

Protocols resolve protocol names to RFC-defined protocol numbers. A protocol number is a field in the IPv4 header that identifies the upper-layer protocol (such as TCP or UDP) to which the IPv4 packet payload should be passed.

### Resolving Service Names to Port Numbers and Protocol Names

Services resolve service names to port numbers and protocol names. Port numbers correspond to fields in the TCP or UDP headers that identify the application using TCP or UDP.

### Verifying and Testing TCP/IP Configuration and Connectivity

After configuring TCP/IP, you can use the `Ipconfig` and `Ping` tools to verify and test the configuration and connectivity to other TCP/IP hosts and networks.

#### The `Ipconfig` Tool

Use the `Ipconfig` tool to verify TCP/IP configuration parameters on a host, including:

- **IPv4**: IPv4 address, subnet mask, and default gateway.
- **IPv6**: IPv6 addresses and the default router.

`Ipconfig` is useful for determining whether the configuration is initialized and whether a duplicate IP address is configured. To view this information, type `ipconfig` at a command prompt.

**Example Output:**

```plaintext
C:\>ipconfig
Windows IP Configuration
Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection:
   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . : wcoast.example.com
   IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 157.60.139.77
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.252.0
   IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 2001:db8:ffff:f282:204:76ff:fe36:7363
   IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : fec0::f282:204:76ff:fe36:7363%2
   IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : fe80::204:76ff:fe36:7363
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 157.60.136.1
                                       2001:db8:1:21ad:210:ffff:fed6:58c0
Tunnel adapter Automatic Tunneling Pseudo-Interface:
   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . : wcoast.example.com
   IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 2001:db8:ffff:f70f:0:5efe:157.60.139.77
   IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : fe80::5efe:157.60.139.77%2
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : fe80::5efe:157.54.253.9%2
```

Type `ipconfig /all` at a command prompt to view additional details such as DNS and WINS server addresses, DHCP server address, and lease information for DHCP-configured IPv4 addresses.

#### The `Ping` Tool

After verifying the configuration with `Ipconfig`, use the `Ping` tool to test connectivity. `Ping` is a diagnostic tool that tests TCP/IP configurations and diagnoses connection failures. It uses ICMP Echo and Echo Reply messages for IPv4 and ICMPv6 Echo Request and Echo Reply messages for IPv6. The basic command syntax is `ping Destination`, where `Destination` is an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a name that can be resolved to an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

**Example Output:**

```plaintext
C:\>ping 157.60.136.1
Pinging 157.60.136.1 with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 157.60.136.1: bytes=32 time<1ms
...
C:\>ping 2001:db8:1:21ad:210:ffff:fed6:58c0
Pinging 2001:db8:1:21ad:210:ffff:fed6:58c0 from 2001:DB8:1:21ad:204:76ff:fe36:7363 with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 2001:db8:1:21ad:210:ffff:fed6:58c0: time<1ms
...
```

To verify a computerâ€™s configuration and test for router connections, follow these steps:

1. Type `ipconfig` at a command prompt to verify whether the TCP/IP configuration has initialized.
2. Ping the IPv4 address of the default gateway or the IPv6 address of the default router to verify their functionality and communication with a node on the local network.
3. Ping the IPv4 or IPv6 address of a remote node to verify communication through a router.

If step 3 is successful, steps 1 and 2 are likely also successful.

**Note:** The `Ping` tool cannot troubleshoot connections if packet filtering routers and host-based firewalls drop ICMP and ICMPv6 traffic. For more information, see Chapter 13, "Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) and Packet Filtering."

### Using Microsoft Network Monitor

Microsoft Network Monitor simplifies troubleshooting complex network problems by monitoring and capturing network traffic for analysis. Network Monitor configures a network adapter to capture all incoming and outgoing packets. You can define capture filters to save specific frames based on source and destination MAC addresses, protocol addresses, and pattern matches. After capturing and filtering, Network Monitor interprets and displays the packet data in readable terms.

**Installation:**

1. Click Start, point to Control Panel, click Add or Remove Programs, and then click Add/Remove Windows Components.
2. In the Windows Components wizard, click Management and Monitoring Tools, and then click Details.
3. Select the Network Monitor Tools check box, and then click OK.
4. If prompted for additional files, insert the product CD or type a path to the location of the files on the network.

**Note:** To perform this procedure, you must be logged on as a member of the Administrators group on the local computer, or have been delegated the appropriate authority. Members of the Domain Admins group may also be able to perform this procedure if the computer is joined to a domain.
