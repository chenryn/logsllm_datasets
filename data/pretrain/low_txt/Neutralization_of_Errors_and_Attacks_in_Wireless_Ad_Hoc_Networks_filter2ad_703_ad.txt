### 8. Simulation Study of a Faulty Sensor Network

The following sections present the results of a simulation study conducted on a faulty sensor network, focusing on various performance metrics and fault models.

#### 8.1 Miss Alarm Probability
The miss alarm probability is shown in Figure 8(a). The y-axis represents the probability of missing an alarm, while the x-axis lists different fault models: No Fault, Signal, Calibration Stuck At Zero, Position, and Interference. The legend indicates different configurations: No IC, IC with L=2, IC with L=3, IC with L=4, IC with L=5, IC with L=6, and IC with L=7.

#### 8.2 False Alarm Probability
Figure 8(b) illustrates the false alarm probability. The y-axis shows the probability of a false alarm, and the x-axis lists the same fault models as in Figure 8(a).

#### 8.3 Energy Consumption with Target
Figure 8(c) presents the energy consumption when a target is present. The y-axis represents the total energy consumption, and the x-axis lists the fault models. The legend indicates the same configurations as in Figure 8(a).

#### 8.4 Energy Consumption with No Target
Figure 8(d) shows the energy consumption when no target is present. The y-axis represents the total energy consumption, and the x-axis lists the fault models. The legend indicates the same configurations as in Figure 8(a).

#### 8.5 Target Detection Latency
Figure 8(e) displays the target detection latency. The y-axis represents the latency in seconds, and the x-axis lists the fault models. The legend indicates the same configurations as in Figure 8(a).

#### 8.6 Target Localization Error
Figure 8(f) illustrates the target localization error. The y-axis represents the error in meters, and the x-axis lists the fault models. The legend indicates the same configurations as in Figure 8(a).

### 9. Performance Analysis

The inner-circle approach significantly improves performance in the considered configuration and fault models. Specifically, it provides a six-fold reduction in detection latency and a four-to-five-fold reduction in localization error for inner-circle sizes over four nodes. However, this improvement may not be as pronounced in scenarios with sparse node density or weak target signals detected by very few neighboring nodes (e.g., 1-2 nodes).

To further investigate, we re-ran the experiments with a weaker target signal (K · T = 10000). The results show that, apart from the miss alarm probability, all other metrics exhibit similar improvements to those in Figure 8. The miss alarm probability increases up to 2-5% for inner-circle sizes greater than five nodes, with the worst cases corresponding to signal interference and stuck-at-zero fault modes.

### 10. Related Work

Several researchers have explored providing availability despite crashes and node movement in wireless networks by adapting fault tolerance techniques from distributed systems, such as replication, group communication, and checkpointing [24-26]. However, these techniques are complex and have rarely been extended to more complex failure models, such as data corruption and Byzantine faults [27].

Security guarantees, including integrity, authentication, and authorization, have been extensively studied in wireless ad hoc networks, including wireless sensor networks. However, only a few studies have focused on protecting against internal attacks [28, 29].

In [29], intrusion tolerance is achieved through admission control and threshold cryptography. Nodes must acquire a token (a certificate) from their neighbors, which is collectively signed by K neighbors and periodically renewed. This scheme assumes a local intrusion-detection module on each node and guarantees that a malicious node will eventually be denied access if detected by a sufficient number of neighbors. However, the scheme fails if a malicious node changes its neighborhood before being detected, leaving the network vulnerable to attacks for extended periods.

The inner-circle approach shares some concepts with [29], such as threshold cryptography and localized message signing. A significant difference is the masking nature of inner-circle voting, which prevents erroneous data propagation and avoids the issues in [29].

Intrusion and fault tolerance have been extensively studied in distributed systems, resulting in several prototypes [15, 30, 31]. The inner-circle consistency approach differs from these techniques as it is specifically designed for mobile wireless environments. Traditional methods forcibly replicate data and computation on multiple nodes to mask errors and intrusions, whereas inner-circle consistency leverages naturally available, partially replicated data and computation in the locality of a sender node to neutralize errors and attacks.

### 11. Conclusions

This paper introduces the concept of inner-circle consistency to protect wireless ad hoc networks from errors and attacks. Through local node interaction, errors and attacks are neutralized at the source, preventing their propagation and improving the fidelity of the propagated information. This transforms an unreliable and insecure wireless network into a dependable network substrate, enhancing the reliability and security of applications. The approach combines statistical methods (a proposed fault-tolerant cluster algorithm), threshold cryptography, and application-aware checks to exploit the partially and naturally replicated data and computation in wireless applications. The inner-circle framework is prototyped using the ns-2 network simulator and demonstrated in two significant wireless scenarios: (1) neutralizing black hole attacks in AODV networks and (2) neutralizing sensor errors in a target detection/localization application executed over a wireless sensor network.
