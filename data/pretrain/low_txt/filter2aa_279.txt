## Introduction to Cloud Computing
- **What is the Cloud?**
- **What can I do in the cloud?**
- **What’s required to start?**

### Is Cloud Computing a Useful Tool or a WMD?
- **Useful Tool?**
- **WMD (Weapon of Mass Destruction)?**

## Cloud Computing as a WMD
- **Outline**
  - Threat Agents
  - Attacks
  - Defenses

### Threat Agents
- **Who are they?**
  - Business Rivals
  - Organized Crime
  - Foreign Powers

- **Motivations**
  - Bragging Rights
  - Money
  - Power

### Terms
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service Attack)**
- **Fragmentation Attack**
- **TCP Syn Flood**
  - Sending packets with only the Syn bit set, without listening for a response

### Typical Command and Control
- **Herder**
  - Controller or Scripts
- **Bots**
  - Infected Clients
  - Large number of hosts (potentially millions)
  - Requires significant time
  - Most systems are Windows-based

### Thunder Clap
- **Proof of Concept**
  - Run DDoS attacks from the cloud
  - Use social media as a herder
  - Rapid deployment and ramp-up of systems

### New Command and Control
- **Herder and Botnet**
  - Bandwidth is plentiful
  - Less dispersed
  - Little preparation time
  - Control via social media
  - Anonymous and hard to track

### Attack Types
- **TCP Full Connection**
  - Less effective; not stealthy
- **Packet Fragmentation**
  - Not implemented in proof-of-concept
- **TCP Syn Flood**
  - Dangerous, requires significant bandwidth

### Potential Uses
- **Targeting a website, server, or service**
- **Targeting multiple components or sites**
- **Potentially targeting distributed systems**
- **Running lowlife blackmail schemes (organized crime might)**
- **Selling DDoS services to competitors**
- **Ensuring a website is down permanently**

### Outcome
- **Threat agents can hold your environment hostage**
  - Easily
  - Cheaply
  - Who is watching?

### Creating an Environment
- **Get a credit card**
- **Create a machine image**
  - Include dependencies
- **Deploy zombies**

### Development
- **Tools**
  - Scapy
  - Hping
  - Libdnet
- **Develop attacks**
  - TCP Full
  - Syn No Data
  - Random Source IP

### Boom – pwnt!
- **Outcome**
  - Profit
  - A series of tubes…

### Interworkings of TC
- **Attack!**
- **Work to be done?**
- **Defense?**
  - How can you protect yourself?

### Incident Response
- **CSIRT Teams?**
- **NIST 800-61 Incident Response**

## Cloud Computing Pros
- **Nimble and Agile**
  - Provides agility to startups
  - Easy to deploy large numbers of servers
  - Cost-effective for small companies
  - Only requires a credit card
  - Storage, CloudFront, Queues, etc.

## Cloud Computing Cons
- **Data Security**
  - Storing data on your own computers is the most legally secure way to handle private information, generally requiring a warrant and prior notice.
  - The government asserts it can subpoena your data from cloud providers without prior notice.
- **No Monitoring or Response**
- **Quick and Nimble Server Deployment**
- **Low Cost to Run Effective DDoS**
- **Use of Stolen Credit Cards for Environment**
- **Unmonitored**
  - Could lead to the next large-scale attack in the cloud

### Conclusion
- **Unmonitored – IDS/IPS?**
- **Cloud allows for quick and nimble deployments**
- **Reduces server costs**
- **Your data can be subpoenaed without your consent or knowledge**
- **What about logging?**

### Q&A
- **Thank You**
