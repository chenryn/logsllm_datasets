### Raptor Attacks: A Threat to Anonymity Systems

Raptor attacks enable an adversary at the Autonomous System (AS) level to effectively compromise user anonymity in systems such as Tor. Our experimental results demonstrate that Raptor attacks pose a significant threat to the security of anonymity systems. Key findings include:

1. **Asymmetric Traffic Correlation**: We demonstrated asymmetric traffic correlation on the live Tor network, achieving 95% accuracy with no false positives.
2. **Impact of Routing Asymmetry and Churn**: We quantified the impact of routing asymmetry and routing churn on AS-level attacks, showing an increase of 50% to 100% in effectiveness compared to conventional attacks.
3. **Historical BGP Hijacks**: We uncovered historical BGP hijacks involving Tor relays.
4. **Traffic Analysis Attack via BGP Interception**: We successfully demonstrated a traffic analysis attack via BGP interception on the live Tor network.

We also outlined a taxonomy of potential countermeasures against these attacks.

### Importance of Network Routing in Anonymity Systems

Our work highlights the dangers of abstracting network routing from the analysis of anonymity systems like Tor. It underscores the need for the design of next-generation anonymity systems that can resist Raptor attacks.

### Appendix: Rejected Countermeasures

#### Obfuscating Packet Timings and Sizes
While high-latency mix networks [38, 23] and constant-rate cover traffic [22] can mitigate timing analysis even against an adversary that observes all communications, these defenses are too costly to be deployed in the Tor network.

#### Mitigating Asymmetric Attacks
Our asymmetric correlation attack leverages information in the TCP header, specifically the sequence number field, which indicates the number of acknowledged bytes. One potential countermeasure is to encrypt the TCP header using IP-layer encryption techniques like IPsec. However, this approach introduces several challenges:
- **Engineering Effort**: Substantial effort would be required to migrate Tor towards IPsec.
- **Visibility**: Since IPsec is not widely used, it would make Tor traffic easily distinguishable from other encrypted traffic, compromising its use for applications like censorship resistance.
- **Partial Mitigation**: Encrypting the TCP header may not fully solve the attack, as an adversary could correlate TCP data packets with the number of TCP ACK packets, disregarding the sequence number field.
