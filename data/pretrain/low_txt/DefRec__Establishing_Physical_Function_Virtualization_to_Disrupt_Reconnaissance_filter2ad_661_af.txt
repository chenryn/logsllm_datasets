### Additional Details on Disruption Policy

**APPENDIX A: Details of Probabilistic Dropping Protocol**

We model the protocol as a series of biased coin flips with increasing probabilities, i.e., \( p_0, \ldots, p_k \). The probability that an adversary will be isolated at her \( k \)-th access is given by:
\[ Q_k = p_k \times \prod_{j=0}^{k-1} (1 - p_j) \quad \text{for } 1 \leq k \leq \delta. \]

In other words, the adversary can only access at most \( \delta \) real devices before it is isolated from the control networks.

**Theorem 1.** The chance that an adversary will be isolated from the control networks is evenly distributed, i.e., \( p_0 = Q_0 = Q_1 = \cdots = Q_\delta \), if:
\[ p_k = \frac{p_0}{1 - k \cdot p_0} \]

**Proof:**
We prove this theorem by mathematical induction.

By definition, when \( k = 0 \), we have:
\[ p_0 = \frac{p_0}{1 - 0 \cdot p_0} \quad \text{and} \quad Q_0 = p_0. \]

Assuming that this condition holds when \( k = i \), i.e., if \( p_i = \frac{p_0}{1 - i \cdot p_0} \), we have \( Q_i = p_0 \).

When \( k = i + 1 \), we have:
\[ Q_{i+1} = p_{i+1} \times \prod_{j=0}^{i} (1 - p_j). \]

Through the following derivation, we can represent \( Q_{i+1} \) in terms of \( Q_i \):
\[ Q_{i+1} = \frac{p_0}{1 - (i+1) \cdot p_0} \times \prod_{j=0}^{i} (1 - p_j). \]

Since \( p_j = \frac{p_0}{1 - j \cdot p_0} \), we have:
\[ \prod_{j=0}^{i} (1 - p_j) = \prod_{j=0}^{i} \left(1 - \frac{p_0}{1 - j \cdot p_0}\right) = \prod_{j=0}^{i} \left(\frac{1 - (j+1) \cdot p_0}{1 - j \cdot p_0}\right) = \frac{1 - (i+1) \cdot p_0}{1}. \]

Thus,
\[ Q_{i+1} = \frac{p_0}{1 - (i+1) \cdot p_0} \times \frac{1 - (i+1) \cdot p_0}{1} = p_0. \]

Therefore, by induction, \( Q_k = p_0 \) for all \( 0 \leq k \leq \delta \). This completes the proof.
