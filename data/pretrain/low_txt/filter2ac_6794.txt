**Title: BotConf 2013 - BladeRunner: Adventures in Tracking Botnets**

The challenge of tracking botnets, although not a new one, remains a crucial and productive area of research. For years, we have been monitoring numerous botnets using an internally developed tracking system that has undergone significant enhancements and modifications over time. The core principle of this system is to implement botnet command-and-control (C&C) mechanisms and track the resulting infiltrated botnets.

In this paper, we will explore the evolution of our tracking system, which provides a snapshot of the development of modern botnets. With this historical context, we will delve into our current monitoring methods and present case studies of specific botnet families. We will highlight the results obtained from our system and conclude by introducing a toolkit that enables others to conduct similar investigations.
