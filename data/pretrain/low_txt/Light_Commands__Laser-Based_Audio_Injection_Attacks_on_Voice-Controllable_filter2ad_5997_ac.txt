### Photoacoustic Effect on a Diaphragm

To precisely identify the physical root cause, we selectively illuminated different components of the microphone using a laser. Figure 7 illustrates the laser spot on the ADMP401’s ASIC (left) and the same ASIC covered with opaque epoxy to block laser light (right).

We achieved this by opening the metal package of the Analog Devices ADMP401 microphone and injecting analog signals into its diaphragm and ASIC components using a focused laser beam (see Figure 2). After focusing a 200 µm laser spot on the microphone’s components with a microscope, we observed the strongest signal when the laser was aimed at the microphone’s ASIC, as shown in Figure 7 (left). This direct injection is highly efficient, with less than 0.1 mW of laser power sufficient to saturate the microphone. This suggests that laser light can induce photoelectric transduction within the microphone’s ASIC, as the light is reflected onto the ASIC from the microphone’s metal package.

When the ASIC was covered with opaque epoxy (Figure 7, right), aiming the laser at the ASIC no longer generated any signal. However, even after this treatment, the microphone still produced a signal when the laser spot was directed at the diaphragm. Based on these results, we conclude that, in addition to the photoelectric effect observed on the ASIC, there is another light-induced transduction within the MEMS diaphragm. Given that the diaphragm functions as a simple capacitor, we hypothesize that this effect is due to the physical movement of the diaphragm (i.e., light-induced mechanical vibration).

Although this analysis is not a comprehensive survey of different MEMS microphones, it provides an overall understanding of the physical effects observed. For the remaining experiments, we aimed the laser through the microphone’s acoustic port. We hypothesize that our attacks illuminated both the ASIC and the diaphragm, resulting in a combination of photoacoustic and photoelectric effects.

### Attacking Voice-Controllable Systems

In this section, we evaluate our attack on seventeen popular voice-controllable (VC) systems. Our goal is to determine the minimum laser power required for the attacker to gain control under ideal conditions and the maximum distance at which such control can be achieved under more realistic conditions.

#### Target Selection

We benchmarked our attack against several consumer devices with voice control capabilities (see Table 1). We tested popular voice assistants such as Alexa, Siri, Portal, and Google Assistant. While our list is not exhaustive, it provides insight into the vulnerability of popular VC systems to laser-based voice injection attacks. To explore how different hardware variations affect attack performance, we tested multiple devices running the same voice recognition backend. We also considered third-party devices with built-in speech recognition, such as the EcoBee thermostat.

#### Exploring Laser Power Requirements

We aim to characterize the minimum laser power required under ideal conditions to control a voice-activated system. Before describing our experimental setup, we discuss our selection of voice commands and the criteria for experiment success.

##### Command Selection

We selected four voice commands representing common operations performed by VC systems:
- **What Time Is It?** - A baseline command requiring the device to recognize the command and access the internet.
- **Set the Volume to Zero.** - Demonstrates the attacker's ability to control the output, likely the first command to avoid attracting attention.
- **Purchase a Laser Pointer.** - Shows how an attacker can place orders on behalf of users.
- **Open the Garage Door.** - Illustrates interaction with additional linked systems, such as a garage door opener.

##### Command Generation

We generated audio recordings of the commands using a common audio recording system (e.g., Audacity). Each command was appended to a recording of the wake word corresponding to the device being tested and normalized. We obtained a corpus of 16 complete commands. For each device, we injected four commands (beginning with the appropriate wake word) into the device’s microphone and observed the response. No machine learning algorithms or device-specific calibration were used during the generation of the audio files.

##### Verifying Successful Injection

A command injection is considered successful if the device correctly interprets the command. For devices with screens, we verified the correct transcription. For screen-less devices, we examined the command log of the associated account.

##### Attack Success Criteria

For a given power budget, distance, and command, we consider the injection successful if the device correctly recognizes the command during three consecutive attempts. An attack is considered successful for a given power budget and distance if all four commands are successfully injected in three consecutive attempts.

##### Voice Customization and Security Settings

For the experiments, we left all device settings in their default configuration. For embedded Alexa and Google VC systems, voice customization is off by default. For phones and tablets, we personalized the device’s voice recognition system with the human voice used to generate the command recordings.

##### Experimental Setup

We used a blue laser and Thorlabs laser driver, aiming the laser at the microphone ports of the devices listed in Table 1 from a distance of about 30 cm. The setup was placed in a metal enclosure to control the environment. We used electrically controlled scanning mirrors to precisely place the laser beam in the center of the device’s microphone port.

##### Experimental Results

Table 1 summarizes our results. The required power varied from 0.5 mW (Google Home) to 60 mW (Galaxy S9). All devices were susceptible to laser-based command injection, even when the microphone port was covered with fabric or foam.

#### Exploring Attack Range

The experiments in Section 5.1 were conducted under ideal conditions. In this section, we report on attack results under more realistic distance and aiming conditions.

##### Experimental Setup

From the previous experiments, we noted that 60 mW of laser power is sufficient for attacking all tested devices. We benchmarked the range using two power budgets:
- **60 mW High-Power Laser:** Emulating an attacker disregarding safety protocols.
- **5 mW Low-Power Laser:** Exploring the maximum range for a restricted attacker.

##### Laser Focusing and Aiming

For large attack distances, laser focusing requires a large diameter lens. We used a 110 m long hallway for 5 mW tests and a 50 m long hallway for 60 mW tests.

### Summary of Results

Table 1 shows the tested devices with the minimum activation power and the maximum distance achievable at 5 mW and 60 mW. The data is limited to the lengths of the hallways used for testing.
