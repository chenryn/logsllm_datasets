# Insecurity Engineering: Locks, Lies, and Videotape

## Lock Design: Mechanical vs. Security Engineering

### Previous DefCon Presentations
- **Vulnerabilities in Mechanical and Electro-Mechanical Locks**: These vulnerabilities often result from defective or deficient engineering.
- **Standards Problem**: There is a comprehensive issue with standards that fail to address the "why" behind lock vulnerabilities, focusing instead on "how" they can be opened.

## Insecurity Engineering
### Deficient or Defective Products
- **Intersection of Mechanical and Security Engineering**: The intersection of these two fields is crucial for understanding and addressing security vulnerabilities.
- **False Sense of Security**: What appears secure may not be. How do you differentiate? Overreliance on standards can be misleading.
- **Misrepresentations by Manufacturers**: Specific design failures include:
  - Kwikset SmartKey®
  - KABA In-Sync
  - AMSEC Electronic Safe ES813
  - ILOQ Electro-Mechanical Lock
  - Biolock Fingerprint Lock

## Locks: The First Line of Defense
- **First Security Barrier**: Often, locks are the only security layer.
- **Measured by Standards**: But what if they are not rated by UL or BHMA?
- **Assessing Security**: How do you know if a lock is secure? What does "secure" mean?

## Manufacturer Responsibilities
- **Competence in Both Fields**: Manufacturers have a unique responsibility to be competent in both mechanical and security engineering.
- **Implied Representations**: They often claim to be experts and that their products meet or exceed standards.

## Expertise Required in Lock Design
- **Mechanical and Security Engineering**: Minimum industry standards require a certain level of knowledge.
- **Security Engineering Requires**:
  - Understanding the use of wires, magnets, paperclips, ballpoint pens, and aluminum foil.
  - Knowledge of bypass techniques.

## Engineering Failures: Results and Consequences
- **Insecurity Engineering**:
  - Insecure products that are often easily bypassed.
  - Relying on standards that do not address relevant issues.
  - Products that look great but are not secure.
  - False sense of security.

## Cost and Appearance vs. Quality and Security
- **Value for Money**: Do you get what you pay for? A $2 lock is a $2 lock.
- **Shortcuts and Clever Designs**: Shortcuts do not equal security, and clever designs may reduce it.
- **Patents and Security**: Patents do not guarantee security.

## Security Grades vs. Security Ratings
- **UL 437 and BHMA 156.30 Security Standards**: These standards define security grades.
- **Deadbolt Security**:
  - Differentiating between lock cylinder and locking hardware.
  - Locks and hardware are distinct.
  - "The key never unlocks the lock."

## Lock Manufacturers Often Cannot Open Their Own Locks
- **Meeting Standards but Not Secure**: Many manufacturers misrepresent their products and produce insecure ones.
- **Examples of Incompetent Security Engineering**:
  - Conventional Pin Tumbler Lock
  - Electro-Mechanical Lock
  - Biometric Fingerprint Lock
  - Electronic RFID Lock
  - Consumer Electronic Safe
  - All appear secure, but none are.

## Analysis of Each Lock
- **How It Works**
- **Why Deficient or Defective**
- **Bypass Vulnerabilities**
- **Manufacturer Statements**
- **Understanding the Methodology**
- **First Rule**: "The key never unlocks the lock."

### Example #1: Kwikset SmartKey®
- **Cost to Manufacturer**: $2
- **Clever Design, Poor Security**: Despite being popular, it has many security vulnerabilities.
- **Kwikset Attributes**:
  - Programmable
  - Copied and modified earlier designs
  - Bump-resistant
  - Pick-resistant
- **Kwikset Representations**:
  - "ANSI Grade 1 deadbolt for the ultimate in security."
  - Increased security, bump-resistant, pick-resistant.
- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - Commercial tools available
  - Easy to compromise with simple implements
  - Tiny sliders and thin metal cover at the end of the keyway
  - Can be opened relatively easily and quickly with wires, small screwdrivers, or a $.05 piece of metal.

### Example #2: ILOQ
- **Made in Finland**
- **Electro-Mechanical Design**: Uses a mechanical key and credentials.
- **No Batteries**: Generates power like a clock and magneto.
- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - Once set, any key will open the lock.
  - No need for credentials.
  - Virtually no security.
  - Difficult to detect.
  - Lock operates normally once set.

### Example #3: KABA In-Sync RFID-Based Lock
- **Wide Application**: Used in military and civilian applications.
- **Simulated Plastic Key with RFID**: Provides an audit trail.
- **Internal Mechanism**: Locking bolt retracts to open.

### Example #4: AMSEC ES813 Consumer “Safe”
- **Consumer-Level Safe**: $100 for the smallest unit.
- **Electronic Keypad**: Incompetent design found in many other safes.

### Example #5: Biolock Biometric Lock
- **Fingerprint + Bypass Cylinder**: Looks secure but is not.
- **Cost**: $200 or more.
- **Insecurity Engineering at Its Best**.

## Lessons Learned
- **Clever Security**: Locks require both mechanical and security engineering.
- **Patents and Security**: Patents do not guarantee security.
- **Standards and Security**: Standards do not always mean security.

## Industry Update
- **Standards**: Addressing issues like bumping and proposed BHMA changes.
- **Manufacturers Paying Attention**: Making changes based on prior DefCon presentations.
- **Real-World Testing**: Working with manufacturers to test locks in real-world scenarios.

## Security Labs: Real-World Testing
- **Mission of Security Labs**:
  - Test locks for major companies and vendors.
  - Determine and expose vulnerabilities.
  - Work with clients in new product design.
  - Pursue actions for defective products.

## Conclusions
- **Misrepresentations by Manufacturers**: High-tech designs do not always mean security.
- **Bypass Tools**: Many locks rely on insecurity.
- **Manufacturer Awareness**: Many manufacturers are unaware of vulnerabilities.
- **Insecurity = Liability**: Caveat emptor (let the buyer beware).
