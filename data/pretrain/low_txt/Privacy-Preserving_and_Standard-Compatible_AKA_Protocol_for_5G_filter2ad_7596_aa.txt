## Abstract

The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has published the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol for the 5th generation (5G) mobile communication system, known as 5G-AKA, in Technical Specification (TS) 33.501. This protocol introduces public key encryption to conceal Subscriber Permanent Identifiers (SUPIs) to enhance user privacy. However, 5G-AKA is only effective against passive attackers and remains vulnerable to linkability attacks from active attackers, who can track target mobile phones by replaying messages from previous sessions.

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving solution for the 5G AKA protocol, denoted as 5G-AKA'. Our solution is resistant to linkability attacks performed by active attackers and is compatible with existing SIM cards and deployed Serving Networks (SNs). We first analyze known linkability attacks in 5G-AKA and identify a common root cause. We then design a countermeasure using the key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) inherent in Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES). This countermeasure encrypts the challenges sent by the Home Network (HN) with a session-specific shared key, ensuring that a replayed message fails the Message Authentication Code (MAC) check. 

5G-AKA' does not increase bandwidth costs and introduces minimal additional time costs, ranging from 0.02% to 0.03%. We use the Tamarin prover, a state-of-the-art formal verification tool, to prove that 5G-AKA' achieves the desired security goals of privacy, authentication, and secrecy.

## 1. Introduction

Mobile communication systems have become an integral part of daily life. According to the GSM Association (GSMA), over 5 billion people had subscribed to mobile services by the end of 2018, accounting for 67% of the global population. The scale of mobile communication systems is expected to continue growing with the global deployment of 5G network infrastructures and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.

In TS 33.501, 3GPP describes new versions of AKA protocols for 5G, enabling User Equipment (UE) and Home Network (HN) to authenticate each other and establish key materials (anchor keys) for subsequent 5G procedures. 5G-AKA builds on the design characteristics of 3G and 4G AKA protocols, including challenge-response procedures and sequence numbers.

Compared to 3G and 4G AKA, 5G-AKA enhances user privacy by disallowing the unsecured transmission of SUPIs. TS 33.501 mandates that SUPIs must be encrypted using ECIES with the HN's public key when transmitted over the radio, preventing IMSI-catching attacks. However, recent research has shown that 5G-AKA is still vulnerable to linkability attacks from active attackers, who can distinguish a target UE by replaying messages from its previous AKA sessions. These attacks can also be exploited to track UEs across different generations of mobile communication protocols (e.g., 4G and 5G).

Given the rapid development of open-source 5G solutions, it is reasonable to assume that real-world attackers can mount active attacks at an acceptable cost. Improving the privacy of 5G-AKA is crucial but challenging, as any solution must address multiple types of linkability attacks while remaining compatible with current 3GPP specifications.

### 1.1 Our Contributions

In this paper, we propose 5G-AKA' as a privacy-preserving solution for the 5G AKA protocol. Our contributions are:

- **In-Depth Analysis of Known Linkability Attacks:** We conduct a detailed analysis of all known linkability attacks and find that they share a common root cause. Specifically, these attacks exploit the two-step check that a UE performs on the HN's challenge. An attacker can use a target UE's previous session to create an attack vector with a replayed message, which passes the MAC check but fails for non-target UEs.

- **Fixing Privacy Issues in 5G-AKA:** To address this, we propose a countermeasure that encrypts the HN's challenge with a temporary shared key established using the KEM in ECIES. This key varies in each session, ensuring that a replayed message fails the MAC check. We integrate this countermeasure into 5G-AKA, resulting in 5G-AKA', which:
  - Does not introduce new primitives, as ECIES is already included in TS 33.501.
  - Is compatible with the standard AUTHENTICATE SIM command, allowing reuse of existing SIM cards.
  - Aligns with 3GPP specifications for 5G networks (e.g., TS 23.502 and TS 24.301).
  - Provides the desired properties of authentication and secrecy.
  - Introduces minimal additional computation costs (0.02% to 0.03%) without increasing bandwidth.

- **Formal Verification of 5G-AKA':** We formally analyze 5G-AKA' using Tamarin Prover, proving that it satisfies the goals of authentication, secrecy, and privacy against active attackers. Our analysis models ECIES abstractly, making the results applicable to variants using other asymmetric encryption schemes following the KEM/DEM paradigm.

## 2. Related Work

### Formal Verification of 5G-AKA

Formal methods have been widely used to evaluate the security of 3GPP AKA protocols and their variants for 3G and 4G systems. Basin et al. [24] refined the security and privacy properties required by 5G-AKA from 3GPP specifications and evaluated 5G-AKA using Tamarin Prover. They identified missing security assumptions and proved the existence of Failure Message Linkability Attack in 5G-AKA. Cremers et al. [31] provided a fine-grained analysis, highlighting potential race conditions and trust assumptions in 5G-AKA.

### Improving the Privacy of 5G-AKA

Several pseudonym mechanisms have been proposed to improve the privacy of mobile subscribers in 5G-AKA [41, 42, 55]. These schemes use changing pseudonyms instead of persistent identifiers (SUPIs) but do not fully address linkability attacks from active attackers. Arapinis et al. [22] suggested encrypting failure messages to prevent failure message linkability attacks, but this requires changes to all SNs. Borgaonkar et al. [26] identified a variant of the failure message linkability attack, known as the sequence number inference attack, and proposed solutions to mitigate it.
