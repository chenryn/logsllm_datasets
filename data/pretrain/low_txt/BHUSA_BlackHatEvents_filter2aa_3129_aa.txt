### Background
- **Advertising Ecosystem:**
  - **Advertising Alliance**
  - **Platform**
  - **Advertisers**
  - **Websites, Apps, We Media, Mini Programs**
  - **Advertising Styles:**
    - Splash Ads
    - News Feed Ads

  - **Apps:** Billions of Monthly Active Users (MAU)

### Advertising Fraud and Anti-Fraud
- **Case 1: Malware in Mobile Big Data Analysis SDK**
  - A trusted data analysis company with an SDK integrated into many popular apps.
  - The SDK loads malware DEX dynamically from the network.
  - **Process:**
    1. Request the latest patch.
    2. Request a step1 jar (encrypted, needs decryption and decompression).
    3. Include two resources; "cloudE" jar decodes "cloudL".
    4. Request plugin jar.
    5. Get auto-click script and parameters.
  - **Execution:**
    - Download config, inject auto-click script into an invisible webview, scroll, wait, and click.
    - Use ActivityContainer technology to hook and simulate user interactions.

- **Case 2: Malware in PC Bundled Software Installer**
  - Hijack userâ€™s browser using JSONP API to add fans to WeMedia.
  - Replace or add profit channels in requests.

- **Case 3: Variety of Malicious Ad Click Tools**
  - **JingYi Web Browser Library:**
    - Based on miniblink, supports simulation of various browser properties.
  - **Captain Module:**
    - Tagged as China Puppeteer, free, stable, and open source.
    - Supports various camouflages and fingerprint plugins.
    - Manual-grade keyboard and mouse commands.
  - **Mobile Version Keypress Genius Software:**
    - Integrated with Android simulators for automated ad clicks.

### Crowd and Key Tech Analysis
- **High-Level Underground Industry Group:**
  - Corporatized operations with dozens to hundreds of people.
  - Registered companies claiming to be advertising monetization platforms.
  - Clear division of labor, strong technical ability, and high anti-analysis intensity.
  - Huge profit scale and significant social impact.

- **Low-Level Underground Industry Group:**
  - Individual or small teams with lower education levels.
  - Skilled in scripting languages but with weak legal awareness.
  - Low technical ability but highly diligent for profit.
  - Produce low-cost tools and have a technology exchange ecosystem.
  - Can also cause massive damage and bad social impact.

- **Technology Summary:**
  - **High-Level Groups:**
    - Reverse engineering and repackaging/wrapping ad platform SDKs.
    - Anti-debugging, anti-analysis, obfuscation, and dynamic loading.
    - Custom developed webviews and backdoors for controlling real users' phones.
    - Invisible ad presentation and automatic click simulation.
  - **Low-Level Groups:**
    - Using PC simulations, browser libraries, and headless/automated browsers.
    - Cloud mobile phones with automatic operation plugins.
    - Group control of mobile phones, proxy servers, and VPNs.
    - Keypress genius software and flow manipulation tools.

### Detection and Defense
- **Project Heracles:**
  - **Vision/Motivation:**
    - Identify and separate typical cheating and fraudulent traffic.
    - Track and trace ad-fraud underground industry practitioners.
  - **Detection Targets:**
    - All technologies used by high-level and low-level groups.
  - **Main R&D:**
    - Security researchers.
  - **Execution Path:**
    - Fingerprinting and information leak detection.

### Summary and Recommendations
- **Summary:**
  - Detailed analysis of the advertising fraud ecosystem and its key players.
  - In-depth examination of typical cases and the technologies used.
  - Insights into the crowd and key tech analysis of both high-level and low-level groups.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Implement robust detection and defense mechanisms.
  - Collaborate with security researchers and industry partners.
  - Continuously update and enhance security measures to combat evolving threats.
