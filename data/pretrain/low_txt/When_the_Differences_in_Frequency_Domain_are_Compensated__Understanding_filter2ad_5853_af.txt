### A Mathematical Proof of Ringing Artifacts in Modulated Replay Audio

**Theorem A.1. Uncertainty Principle: It is difficult to accurately determine the entire frequency response of a loudspeaker.**

**Proof.** The frequency response of a loudspeaker consists of both amplitude and phase responses. The measurement of the amplitude response is well-documented in Section 3.4. However, measuring the phase response accurately is challenging.

For an electronic circuit system, the phase response can be measured by observing the electric signals \( x_{\text{out}}(t) \) and \( x_{\text{in}}(t) \) with an oscilloscope. In a loudspeaker system, direct measurement of the phase response is not possible because the output signal \( x_{\text{out}}(t) \) is a sound wave. Additional equipment, such as a receiver that converts the sound wave into an electronic signal, is required. This introduces additional phase differences. The main factors influencing these differences are:

1. **Time of Flight:** The propagation time adds phase differences. Accurate delay time \( t = \frac{L}{v_0} \) must be known, where \( L \) is the direct distance between the speaker and the sensor, and \( v_0 \approx 344 \, \text{m/s} \) at 20°C.

2. **Time Incoherence:** Most available loudspeakers are not time-coherent, leading to phase errors in the measurement.

These factors make it difficult to accurately measure the phase response, thus supporting the uncertainty principle.
