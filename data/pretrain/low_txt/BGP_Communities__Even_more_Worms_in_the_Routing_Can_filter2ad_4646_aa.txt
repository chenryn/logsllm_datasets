## Abstract
BGP communities are a widely used mechanism by operators to manage policies, mitigate attacks, and engineer traffic. They can be used to drop unwanted traffic, filter announcements, adjust local preferences, and prepend paths to influence peer selection. Unfortunately, we demonstrate that BGP communities can be exploited by remote parties to influence routing in unintended ways. These vulnerabilities arise from complex policies, error-prone configurations, a lack of cryptographic integrity and authenticity over communities, and the extensive propagation of communities. Due to their ill-defined semantics, BGP communities often propagate far beyond their intended scope, enabling remote adversaries to trigger blackholing, steer traffic, and manipulate routes without prefix hijacking. We provide examples of these attacks through scenarios tested both in the lab and in the wild. While we suggest mitigation strategies, it is up to the Internet operations community to implement them.

## 1. Introduction
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) communicates reachability information between neighbors in the Internet. As the network has evolved, the complexity of connections, policies, and economics has driven the need for similarly complex and fine-grained routing policies. BGP, the de facto inter-domain routing protocol, has been extended to support such policies and provide value-added services. This work focuses on one such extension, BGP communities, and the implications of their real-world implementation and deployment.

BGP communities are an optional transitive BGP attribute used to "tag" advertisements. Operators frequently configure their infrastructure to take different actions based on community tags. Thus, communities not only provide a common label for groups of prefixes but also enable the signaling of semantics between ASes and within an AS.

BGP communities are increasingly popular and are used to encode a wide variety of information. Within the last year, the number of observable communities increased by roughly 20% (see Section 4). Communities are used to realize routing policies, bias path or peer selection, steer traffic, and offer value-added services for customers of ISPs and members of IXPs, including tagging route ingress points and origins, selective advertisement, traffic engineering, and Remotely Triggered Blackholing (RTBH) to mitigate Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

While BGP communities appear innocuous, we show that they can be exploited to influence routing in unintended ways. Although the community-based attacks we consider require certain conditions for success, our extensive measurements indicate that these conditions are sufficiently widespread to warrant operational attention. Importantly, since communities are widely propagated, an attacker exploiting the BGP communities of a particular AS need not be a directly connected peer. Further, we demonstrate the feasibility of attacks both with and without address space hijacking, suggesting that existing hijack detection methods are insufficient to detect community-based attacks.

These attacks result from weaknesses in the current use and implementation of BGP communities and community-based services. Services enabled by communities are typically relevant only between directly connected ASes. However, via large-scale analysis of passive BGP datasets, we find that more than 50% of BGP communities traverse more than four ASes, and 10% have a hop count of more than six (see Section 4).

To better assess the potential vulnerabilities, we design multiple scenarios highlighting intentional, unintentional, and malicious community use (Section 5). These include the ability to remotely signal blackholing of a prefix, traffic steering, and route manipulation of another AS’s prefixes.

To demonstrate the vulnerabilities in practice, we conducted two classes of experiments with prior coordination and permission from all involved ASes and networks (see Section 7.1). First, we tested in the lab the conditions required to realize the attacks, finding default and recommended configurations that enable the attacks. Using insights from the lab, we conducted experiments in the wild to demonstrate the feasibility of these attacks in the real Internet. Our evaluation shows that some BGP community-based attacks are easy to achieve, even if the attacker is on the AS path and BGP route validation is used.

In summary, the community attacks we demonstrate result from weaknesses in the current use and implementation of BGP communities and community-based services, including community propagation behavior, complex policies, error-prone configurations, and a lack of cryptographic integrity and authenticity for communities. The main contributions of this paper are:
1. Analysis of BGP community propagation (Section 4), showing that 2.2K networks forward received BGP communities onward, with the majority of communities propagated through the entire Internet.
2. Identification of sufficient conditions for community-based attacks on the routing system (Section 3).
3. Three scenarios of how BGP communities can be misused (Section 5).
4. Demonstration that these attacks are possible in lab experiments and in the wild (Sections 6 and 7), highlighting traffic dropping due to remotely triggered blackholing, as well as remote steering of traffic and route manipulation, possibly through a rogue traffic monitor.
5. Recommendations on the use of communities (Section 8).

## 2. BGP Communities: A Primer
Communities are an optional BGP attribute used as a signaling mechanism within and between ASes. The 32-bit community field can take any value, but by convention, the first 16 bits represent the AS Number (ASN) of the entity defining the community, while the last 16 bits indicate an action or label. The human-readable community presentation format separates numeric representations of the ASN and label with a colon, e.g., 3130:411.

There is only a small set of standardized well-known community labels, such as NO_EXPORT (65535:65281) and NO_PEER (65535:65284). These cover a very small subset of all communities in use and the complex routing policies network operators realize via BGP communities. An AS is free to define the semantics of the 2^16 possible values for its communities. For example, AS 3130 "owns" communities 3130:XXXX and may define them arbitrarily. There are no explicit mechanisms to enforce this segmentation of the community space, and any AS is free to add, delete, or modify the communities of BGP advertisements that transit its control plane.

Communities can be added, deleted, or set by an AS on prefix origination, ingress, or egress. Bonaventure et al. proposed a taxonomy of community values, identifying two main modes of operation: AS-internal communities set when receiving a route, and outbound communities used to signal or pass information down the path. Outbound communities fall into categories such as route selection, selective announcement, route suppression, blackholing, and location signaling.

Figure 1 illustrates common uses of communities in practice. Here, AS6 tags incoming routes with the geographic location where the prefix was received, and AS3 defines the received community AS3:103 to prepend its AS three times to the path. AS1 can then perform route selection by attaching the community AS3:103 to the announcement of p1 to AS3. Once AS4 receives both announcements for p1, it will prefer the shorter path via AS2.

The level of community support and documentation varies among providers. Some networks, especially large ISPs and IXPs, implement fine-grained semantics using hundreds of communities. However, there is no central database of record for providers' communities and associated actions, leading to scattered and incomplete documentation. This results in a lack of a definitive understanding of the global definitions and use of communities.

Further complicating the use of communities is the lack of a strict policy for handling incoming routes tagged with communities. Therefore, there is no consistent behavior in forwarding BGP communities among different networks. We discuss the implications of this design choice in Section 3 and measure the extent of community propagation in Section 4.

## 3. BGP Communities: Can of Worms
By allowing ASes to extend the semantics of routing updates, BGP communities can significantly simplify policy implementation. However, they also present a "can of worms" in the sense of a situation that causes many problems when you start to deal with it. We now show why this is too often the case in today's Internet.

### 3.1 Motivating Example Scenario
We use a common community service, AS path prepending, to illustrate the intended use of communities and the potential for abuse (see Figure 2). AS1 announces the prefix p to AS2 and on to AS4, which announces it to AS3 and AS5, and then on to AS6. Consider traffic from AS6 to p. If the AS paths via AS3 and AS5 have the same length, AS6 may choose to route via AS3. AS3 offers AS path prepending via the community AS3:×n to prepend n times, where n is typically between 1 and 3. The intended use of this service is to enable AS3's peers, such as AS4, to do traffic steering.

However, if some AS on the path, such as AS4, does not filter communities, this service can be (ab)used by other ASes on the announcement path. Potential abuses include AS2 or AS1 setting the community AS3:×3 on the announcement of prefix p, causing AS3 to path prepend three times for the announcement of p to AS6. This changes the traffic flow from AS6 toward AS1 to choose the AS5 instead of AS3. The motivation for AS2 might be:
- Malicious interceptor: If AS5 is a malicious interceptor, AS2 can steer traffic through it.
- Impose additional cost: The link from AS5 to AS4 might be more expensive than the link between AS3 and AS4. AS2 forces AS4's ingress traffic to the "expensive link," increasing costs for AS4.
- Performance improvement: If the service offered by AS6 is popular and the performance via AS5 in terms of bandwidth and/or delay is significantly better, AS2 may improve its service.

This scenario highlights the potential for unintended and malicious use of BGP communities, emphasizing the need for careful configuration and monitoring.
