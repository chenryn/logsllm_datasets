### Environment
- Electron Version: 0.36.0
- Operating System: OS X 10.10.3
- `BrowserWindow` Configuration: `'title-bar-style'` set to `'hidden-inset'`

### Problem Description

In the current setup, there is a draggable area at the top of the window, even if no elements are placed in that region. This draggable area has a standard size for this type of window in OS X, as defined in _System Preferences_. 

I am unable to disable this draggable area for my buttons or other elements using the `-webkit-app-region: no-drag;` CSS property.

This issue seems to be new in Electron 0.36.0, as I do not recall encountering it in version 0.35.
