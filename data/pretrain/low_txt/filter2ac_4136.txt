**Title: Botconf 2017 - KNIGHTCRAWLER: "Discovering Watering Holes for Fun, Not Profit"**

**Abstract:**
How can one identify watering holes (also known as Strategic Web Compromise â€“ SWC) from the comfort of their own home? At the intersection of geopolitics and technology, "KNIGHTCRAWLER" is a personal project designed to detect malicious activities across thousands of strategic websites, including those belonging to governments, NGOs, corporations, and news organizations. This initiative has successfully uncovered numerous watering holes related to Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and cybercrime, including several previously unknown exploit kits and threat actors that have not yet been documented in open-source intelligence.
