### Log Summary

The provided log chunk consists of 22 lines, each containing a timestamp, log level, process ID, relevant software component, and the log content. Here is a step-by-step summary of the log events:

1. **Session Closures for User `test`**:
   - On June 30 at 22:16:33, four SSH sessions were closed for user `test` (Process IDs: 19437, 19438, 19439, 19440).

2. **Authentication Failures for User `root`**:
   - On July 1 at 00:21:28, there were two authentication failures for user `root` from IP address `60.30.224.116` (Process IDs: 19630, 19628).
   - At 00:21:30, three more authentication failures occurred for user `root` from the same IP address (Process IDs: 19640, 19642, 19632).
   - At 00:21:31, two additional authentication failures for user `root` from the same IP address (Process IDs: 19643, 19631).
   - At 00:21:32, two more authentication failures for user `root` from the same IP address (Process IDs: 19636, 19645).
   - At 00:21:35, another authentication failure for user `root` from the same IP address (Process ID: 19637).

3. **Session for User `cyrus`**:
   - On July 1 at 04:05:17, a session was opened for user `cyrus` by a user with UID 0 (Process ID: 20298).
   - At 04:05:18, the session for user `cyrus` was closed.

4. **Logrotate Alert**:
   - On July 1 at 04:05:19, an alert was generated indicating that the `logrotate` process exited abnormally with an exit code of 1.

5. **Session for User `news`**:
   - On July 1 at 04:11:35, a session was opened for user `news` by a user with UID 0 (Process ID: 21530).
   - At 04:11:36, the session for user `news` was closed.

6. **Session for User `test`**:
   - On July 1 at 05:02:26, a session was opened for user `test` by a user with UID 509 (Process ID: 21689).

### Key Observations
- Multiple consecutive authentication failures for user `root` from the same IP address (`60.30.224.116`) suggest a potential brute-force attack.
- The `logrotate` process encountered an issue, exiting with an abnormal status.
- Sessions for users `cyrus`, `news`, and `test` were opened and closed within short time frames, which may indicate normal usage or automated processes.
