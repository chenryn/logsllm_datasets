### Robocalling Campaigns and Vulnerable Populations

SSA (Social Security Administration) campaigns are known to target specific segments of the population who are more vulnerable than the general public [29].

**Finding 24:** We uncovered two large-scale robocalling campaigns that selectively targeted Mandarin-speaking Chinese populations in North America. Our campaign identification mechanism revealed two unique robocalling campaigns that operated in Mandarin, targeting Chinese populations in the United States. Each campaign had a size of 62 and 51, respectively. Both campaigns impersonated the Chinese Consulate. The first campaign threatened the recipients with an important document that had expired and required immediate attention, prompting them to press a specific digit. The second campaign informed the recipients of an urgent, time-sensitive message.

### Discussion on Robocall Mitigation

**The Future of Robocall Mitigation:**
Current robocall mitigation techniques rely on caller ID and other heuristics to identify suspected robocalls. Using call traceback [30, 31] to investigate even a fraction of such suspicious calls is time-consuming and does not scale well for service providers. Instead, providers can operate their own honeypots and use the campaign identification technique demonstrated in our paper. This approach allows providers to systematically identify fraudulent and abusive robocalling campaigns and surgically target the source of such operations. By prioritizing the takedown of specific campaigns, providers can better protect their subscribers.

**Will New Initiatives and Regulations Reduce Unsolicited Calls?**
To improve enforcement against unsolicited calls, the United States passed the TRACED Act [32] into law on December 31, 2019. This act mandates the deployment of STIR/SHAKEN within a certain period and increases penalties for illegal calls. Unfortunately, by the time regulatory agencies impose penalties on robocalling operations [33], the perpetrators have already generated billions of robocalls. It remains unclear whether STIR/SHAKEN will be effective in addressing the problem of unsolicited phone calls, especially since calls that transit any TDM network will be unauthenticated. During our study, no providers were passing STIR/SHAKEN authentications to our provider. Therefore, many of our case study scam campaigns operate over long periods based on their line rotation habits.

**Finding 21:** We found that 2.86% (77) of the campaigns used neighbor spoofing by matching the NPA-NXX of the calling number to the called number. On average, 48.5% of calls made by these campaigns used neighbor spoofing. There were 14 (0.52%) campaigns with a 100% neighbor spoofing rate, indicating that they matched the NPA-NXX for every call. These results suggest that operators regularly evolve spoofing strategies within a single campaign. This finding describes the neighbor spoofing behavior observed among recorded phone calls belonging to a specific campaign, whereas Finding 10 provides an aggregate view of neighbor spoofing among all calls made to our honeypot.

### Case Studies

To gain an overview of the contents of a cluster, we randomly selected three calls from the top 40 clusters and listened to them. This allowed us to label the top clusters as seen in Figure 5 and also helped us to selectively delve into campaigns with unique characteristics. We discovered that many telemarketing campaigns use potentially misleading tactics to encourage victims to engage.

**Finding 22:** We uncovered two fraudulent robocalling campaigns that impersonated the Social Security Administration (SSA), a United States agency. Our honeypot discovered two separate large-scale fraudulent campaigns that clearly violated multiple federal and state laws. Both campaigns used different audio recordings. The first SSA Campaign (SSA Campaign #1) was the 10th largest campaign in our honeypot with a campaign size of 396. This campaign extensively used 224 unique toll-free numbers as the caller ID to generate unsolicited calls. We observed that this first SSA Campaign operated throughout the duration of our study from April 2019 to February 2020. The second SSA Campaign (SSA Campaign #2) had a campaign size of 75 and operated from August 2019 to November 2019.

We observe that IRS impersonation (anecdotally one of the most common scams) has given way to different tactics focused on immigration and social security. We suspect that our data does not yet indicate if this mechanism will be effective or not.

### Recommendations and Limitations

**Recommendation to the Public:**
As explained in Section 4.3, we found no statistically significant effect of answering phone calls on the average number of unsolicited phone calls received. Despite this finding, we suggest that the general public should still use caution in answering unsolicited calls.

**Limitations:**
Like all measurement studies, our work has some limitations. First, because we do not seed our numbers, our results may be biased towards campaigns that dial at random. However, the low spread values of our top campaigns indicate that some of our campaigns indeed specifically targeted our lines. Second, our estimates of voicemail spam, wangiri, and neighbor spoofing are based on heuristics and may be subject to false positives. In particular, our neighbor spoofing estimates assume that callers are not purchasing lines to match the caller, and, given the difficulty of such an operation, we believe this is unlikely. Moreover, in general, our methods cannot distinguish between "legitimate" line rotation and spoofing. Finally, because we do not analyze the content of our campaigns, we do not estimate how many of our unsolicited calls fall into the "good" category (e.g., public service announcements) and leave them for future work.

### Related Work

Adversaries continue to thrive [34] in the era of modern telephone networks. Even though researchers [35] have been trying to make telephone networks more secure, end users are constantly bombarded with spam calls [3, 36] and robocalls. Some of the previously proposed techniques to combat spam and fraud [37] in telephone networks employ graph analysis [38–40], use decoys [41], apply machine learning [22,42–45], and clustering techniques [46,47]. Other researchers associate a custom metric for the calling number, like a trust value [48] or a reputation score [49], to detect malicious callers.

The absence of end-to-end mutual authentication in phone networks makes caller ID spoofing trivial. Tu et al. [50] demonstrated that spoofed caller ID is a key factor in tricking victims into revealing their private information, such as their Social Security Number. Caller ID spoofing also allows adversaries to operate without the fear of being tracked. To address this issue, researchers have proposed in-band authentication techniques [51], pre-call authentication [52], improving core SS7 protocol standards [53–55], developed mobile applications [56,57], initiating a call [58] to the calling party during the ringing state, using a trusted third party [59], and coupling SMS with call timing [60] to detect caller ID spoofing. The IETF’s STIR working group [12] has recently proposed the SHAKEN [61] framework, which uses PASSporTs [62] and certificates [63] to authenticate caller ID [64] in SIP networks. However, these standards do not address the challenges in large segments of non-SIP, TDM, and analog circuits that are still operational. By building on top of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ideology, SHAKEN/STIR [65, 66] standards inherit the risks of PKI [67] system designs.

Due to the inherent closed architecture of telephone networks, it is extremely challenging to collect real-world data about how adversaries operate in the wild. Lack of data further prevents us from applying spam detection and mitigation techniques popular in email [68] and SMS [69–75] ecosystems to telephone networks. To collect data and gain insights about how adversaries operate, researchers have scraped websites for audio transcripts [76, 77], used online text-to-speech services to mimic robocallers [78], and generated calls in a lab-controlled environment [42, 79]. We believe that such strategies are inadequate in representing a constantly evolving real-world adversary. Additionally, user-reported details could be biased, inaccurate, and under-represented. Numerous researchers [3, 36, 68] have emphasized the need for collecting and analyzing data from actual phone networks, which can help in the development of robust mitigation techniques. Techniques presented by Balasubramaniyan et al. [80] can be useful to study the network path of a phone call as part of our future work. Actively engaging with the caller [13,50,77] has been an effective approach to gain deeper insights about the adversary's operational characteristics.

Honeypots [81] have served as a mechanism to collect data about adversaries. Honeypots have been used to study worms [82], email spam campaigns [83], SMS spam [71], social media campaigns [14, 84, 85], telephone networks [6, 86], and much more. Previously developed telephony honeypots have certain limitations and inherent assumptions. Gupta et al. [6] and Li et al. [43] do not collect and process call audio, while Balduzzi et al. [16] restrict themselves to specific geographic regions or languages, and Sahin and Francillon [17] use a small number of clean numbers. Previous work [6, 16, 22, 23, 43] either used transcripts to identify clusters of calls or did not account for caller ID spoofing, which is prevalent in adversarial telephone network settings. Our data collection and campaign identification techniques extend far beyond each of them. The techniques proposed and used in this paper are agnostic to caller ID spoofing and the language of the robocall. None of the prior work collects and analyzes the call metadata, call audio content, and signaling information as a whole.

### Conclusion

Robocalls and other forms of unsolicited phone calls have plagued the telephone network. Such calls are a long-standing problem for all people who use a phone. Despite anecdotal evidence of the prevalence of such calls, accurate information on the frequency of these calls is largely unknown. Through a data-driven study, we provide details about the scale at which unsolicited calling campaigns operate in the North American phone network. By experimentation and statistical validation, we find no evidence that answering unsolicited calls increases the number of such calls received. We develop mechanisms to characterize voicemail spam, wangiri scams, and different forms of caller ID spoofing techniques. We develop, evaluate, and apply a robust campaign identification technique using call audio, uncovering 2,687 unique robocalling campaigns in the wild. Based on our observations, we discuss the state of existing detection and mitigation techniques and call for more data-driven studies of the phone network.
