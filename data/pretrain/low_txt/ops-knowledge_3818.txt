I would like to connect to my Raspberry Pi using a remote interpreter. I have successfully set this up in Windows 7 using PyCharm, but after upgrading to Windows 8.1, it no longer works. I have attempted to connect to the same Raspberry Pi (which worked in Windows 7) and another one with a fresh installation of Raspbian (released on September 9, 2014). I have also tried connecting through Ubuntu, but without success.

Has anyone managed to get this working in Windows 8 or any Linux distribution? Should I try using a key pair (OpenSSH or PuTTY)? After adding the RSA key to the repository, the process hangs at "Getting remote interpreter version" and "Connecting to 10.0.0.98."

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue in PyCharm, you can deploy a remote SFTP server. Follow these steps:

1. **Set Up SFTP Deployment:**
   - Go to `Tools > Deployment > Add`.
   - Enter a name for your deployment configuration and select `SFTP` as the type.
   - Enter the host, port, root path (e.g., `/`), username, and password.

2. **Create a New Project:**
   - When creating a new project, change the interpreter to `Deployment Configuration`.
   - Select your SFTP server from the list.

3. **Complete Setup:**
   - Click `OK` and create the project.

After following these steps, you should be able to connect to your Raspberry Pi and use the remote interpreter in PyCharm.
