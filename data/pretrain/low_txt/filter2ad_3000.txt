## Background
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) provide a set of valuable analytic and decision-making techniques that are increasingly being adopted by a wide range of practitioners, many of whom work on applications with security-sensitive elements. However, while security researchers often utilize these techniques to address specific problems, and AI/ML researchers develop methods for big data analytics, there is limited cross-pollination between the two communities. In security research, AI/ML components are frequently treated as black-box solvers, and in the learning community, the security and privacy implications of their algorithms are often overlooked during the design phase.

Despite these differences, the intersection of these fields has given rise to novel questions and a new area of research known as secure learning. The AISec workshop has become the primary venue for this unique fusion of research. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in activity within the AISec/secure learning community, driven by several factors:
1. The critical role of machine learning, data mining, and other AI technologies in extracting knowledge, situational awareness, and security intelligence from big data.
2. The increasing use of learning technologies by industry to address big data challenges for their customers.
3. The growing exposure of companies and their customers to intelligent technologies, which presents both opportunities and vulnerabilities.

The AISec Workshop addresses these needs and serves as the only long-running venue dedicated to this topic. For ten consecutive years, AISec has been co-located with the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), making it the premier meeting place for researchers interested in the intersection of security, privacy, AI, and machine learning. The workshop merges practical security problems with advances in AI and ML, fostering the development of unique theories and analytics. Topics explored include learning in game-theoretic adversarial environments, privacy-preserving learning, and applications to spam and intrusion detection.

## AISec 2017
The tenth annual AISec event, held in 2017, received 36 submissions, of which eleven were selected for publication and presentation. Additionally, approximately four papers were chosen for a "lightning round" presentation. The accepted papers covered a range of topics, including:
- **Malware and Intrusion Detection**: Approaches to evasion and improved classification and discovery.
- **Adversarial Learning**: Evasive and causative attacks from both attacker and defender perspectives.
- **ML-Powered Attacks**: Techniques for defeating security challenges and CAPTCHAs.

The keynote address, titled "Beyond Big Data: What Can We Learn from AI Models?", was delivered by Dr. Aylin Caliskan from Princeton University.

## About the Organizers
### Battista Biggio
Battista Biggio received his M.Sc. (Hons.) in Electronic Engineering and Ph.D. in Electronic Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Cagliari, Italy, in 2006 and 2010, respectively. Since 2007, he has been an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari. In 2011, he visited the University of Tübingen, Germany, where he studied the robustness of machine learning to training data poisoning. His research interests include secure machine learning, multiple classifier systems, kernel methods, biometrics, and computer security. Dr. Biggio has served as a reviewer and program committee member for several international conferences and journals, including AISec. He is a senior member of the IEEE and a member of the IAPR. He has recently been nominated as an Associate Editor of Pattern Recognition and chair of the IAPR Technical Committee 1 on Statistical Pattern Recognition Techniques.

### David Freeman
David Freeman is a Research Scientist/Engineer at Facebook, working on spam and abuse problems. Previously, he led anti-abuse engineering and data science teams at LinkedIn, where he developed statistical models to detect fraud and abuse and worked with the larger machine learning community to build scalable modeling and scoring infrastructure. He is an author, presenter, and organizer at international conferences on machine learning and security, such as NDSS, WWW, and AISec. He is currently co-authoring a book on Machine Learning and Security to be published by O’Reilly. He holds a Ph.D. in mathematics from UC Berkeley and conducted postdoctoral research in cryptography and security at CWI and Stanford University.

### Brad Miller
Brad Miller holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley, and has conducted research applying machine learning to problems in security and privacy. In 2015, he joined the SafeBrowsing team at Google, where he works on developing, launching, and implementing novel machine learning mechanisms to combat phishing and malware on the web. He has received a Best Student Paper award at the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium and has served on the program committee for AISec. He has also been a reviewer for several journals.

### Arunesh Sinha
Arunesh Sinha is an Assistant Research Scientist in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Michigan. He received his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University, where he was advised by Prof. Anupam Datta, and was a postdoctoral scholar with Prof. Milind Tambe at the Computer Science Department of the University of Southern California. He was awarded the Bertucci fellowship at CMU in recognition of his novel research. Dr. Sinha's research lies at the intersection of security, machine learning, and game theory, with a focus on the theoretical aspects of multi-agent interaction, security, and privacy, and an emphasis on real-world applicability.
