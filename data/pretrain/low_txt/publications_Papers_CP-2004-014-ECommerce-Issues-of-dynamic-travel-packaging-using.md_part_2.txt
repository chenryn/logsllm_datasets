# COTRIN Ontology for the Travel Industry

Our research involves the development of a comprehensive and precise reference ontology named COTRIN (Comprehensive Ontology for the Travel Industry). This ontology is derived from XML-based OpenTravel Alliance (OTA) specifications and is designed using the Web Ontology Language (OWL 2004), as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The structure and objectives of our research are illustrated in Figure 1.

## Figure 1. COTRIN Ontology for the Travel Industry

This ontology can be used to integrate autonomous and heterogeneous web services, web processes, applications, data, and components across distributed environments. Semantic web processes manage dynamic travel packages, determining which web services are used, what combinations are allowed or required, and specific rules for computing the final retail price (Cardoso, Miller et al., 2004).

## 2.5 Dynamic Travel Packaging and Quality of Service

In semantic web processes for dynamic travel packages, suppliers and customers define a binding agreement that specifies Quality of Service (QoS) items such as services to be delivered, deadlines, and cost of services (Cardoso and Sheth, 2002). Effective management of QoS metrics in semantic web processes directly impacts the success of organizations participating in e-commerce. Therefore, when services or products are created or managed using web processes, the underlying Workflow Management System (WfMS) must accept the specifications and be capable of estimating, monitoring, and controlling the QoS provided to customers. Proper control of quality leads to the creation of high-quality products and services, which in turn meet customer expectations and achieve customer satisfaction.

We have developed a comprehensive QoS model that allows the description of web process components from a QoS perspective (Cardoso, Miller et al., 2004). This model includes three dimensions: time, cost, and reliability. It is predictive, enabling the automatic computation of the QoS of web processes based on the QoS of their components (web services). We have also presented a mathematical model that formally describes the formulae to compute QoS metrics among web services. Based on these formulae, we have developed the Stochastic Workflow Reduction (SWR) algorithm (Cardoso, 2002) to automatically compute the overall QoS of web processes.

## 2.6 Impact of Our Research

The results of our research will spearhead and foster cross-industry consensus, leading to the establishment and maintenance of the most effective and widely used specifications for electronically exchanging business data and information among all sectors of the travel industry using ontologies.

Our research has a direct impact on the Portuguese tourism industry, as well as the global tourism industry. Portugal is renowned for its tourism, generating over $7.2 billion in revenue in 2002 alone (INE, 2004).

The deployment of ontologies, semantic web services, and semantic web processes in the tourism industry will enable the construction of sophisticated infrastructures to support e-commerce and e-business activities. These ontologies encourage the development of interoperable systems that can help create and support new collections of travel web services, better meeting the demands and expectations of travelers through dynamic packaging. The main sectors of the industry affected include airlines, car rental agencies, hotel corporations, leisure suppliers, tour operators, railways, ferry operators, cruise operators, and other areas of travel and tourism.

## 3. Related Work

Economists were the first to analyze the concept of packaging/bundling (Stigler, 1963; Adams and Yellen, 1976). It has long been recognized that packaging enables savings in transaction costs. With low product information access costs, buyers can take advantage of the benefits of travel packaging by dynamically composing web processes made of services from multiple companies offering heterogeneous products and services (Chang, Li et al., 2003). Chircu et al. (2001) propose an analysis framework for Internet-based corporate travel reservation systems, suggesting several recommendations for managers. This framework has generated significant interest among travel managers due to its potential for cost savings.

Other researchers have also identified the need for the development of semantic web processes for e-commerce applications (SWSWPC, 2004). A notable example is the OWL-S specification (OWL, 2004; OWL-S, 2004), which semantically describes business processes. The use of semantic information facilitates process interoperability between trading partners involved in e-commerce activities.

While significant QoS research has been conducted in the areas of networking, real-time applications, and middleware, the literature on QoS for web processes is limited. The Crossflow project (Klingemann, WÃ¤sch et al., 1999; Damen, Derks et al., 2000; Grefen, Aberer et al., 2000) has made a major contribution. In their approach, information about past process executions is collected in a log and used to calculate the time and cost associated with process executions.

Although research on QoS for WfMS is limited, research on time management, which falls under the umbrella of workflow QoS, has been more active and productive. Significant work in this area can be found in (Pozewaunig, Eder et al., 1997; Reichert and Dadam, 1998; Eder, Panagos et al., 1999; Marjanovic and Orlowska, 1999; Bauer and Dadam, 2000; Gillmann, Weissenfels et al., 2000; Gillmann, Weikum et al., 2002).

## 4. Conclusion

The web has permanently changed how vacation packages are created. Consumers can now acquire packages from a variety of websites, including online agencies and airlines. With the growth of web travel, a new technology has emerged for the leisure travel industry: dynamic travel packaging.

This new trend in the travel industry requires the ability to dynamically compose travel packages from the aggregation and orchestration of distributed web services. As demand for customized travel itineraries increases, agencies seek technology that provides their clients the flexibility to build unique packages from a selection of choices. Dynamic packages can be created and booked effortlessly with private and published air, car hire, hotels, attractions, and insurance rates.

Current approaches using XML-based specification messages (such as OTA specifications) are not sufficient to enable the creation of dynamic travel packages. One solution is the use of ontologies to overcome semantic problems arising from the autonomy, heterogeneity, and distribution of web services. Our research aims to develop a comprehensive and functional ontology relating the terms commonly used by the tourism industry when exchanging data and information to deploy and manage web processes for dynamically composing travel packages. This cannot be successful without the implementation of methods and algorithms to compute the QoS of the semantic web processes developed.
