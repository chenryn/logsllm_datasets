## Abstract
The increasing digitalization of industrial networks, such as those used for factory and process automation, has brought these once-isolated systems closer to the Internet, necessitating secure communication. OPC UA, a leading protocol for secure industrial communication, is challenging to configure securely due to its numerous insecure options. To investigate the security of Internet-facing OPC UA deployments, we actively scanned the IPv4 address space for publicly accessible OPC UA systems and evaluated their configurations. Our findings reveal that 92% of the reachable deployments have problematic security configurations, including missing access control (24%), disabled security features (24%), and the use of deprecated cryptographic primitives (25%). Additionally, we discovered several hundred devices across multiple autonomous systems sharing the same security certificate, making them vulnerable to impersonation attacks. This paper highlights common security misconfigurations and underscores the importance of proper configuration for protocols featuring security.

## 1 Introduction
Traditionally, industrial networks, such as those used for factory and process automation, were designed as isolated networks with no connections to office networks or the Internet [6, 44]. Consequently, industrial protocols like Modbus or ProfiNet did not implement any security features. However, with the growing interconnection of industrial networks, serious security threats have emerged, as evidenced by incidents like NotPetya and manipulation attacks on industrial devices [26]. These threats, combined with the rise in industrial communication (e.g., driven by Industry 4.0), highlight the need for secure industrial protocols.

OPC UA, released in 2008, was designed with security in mind [19] and is attested as secure (e.g., by the German Federal Office for Information Security [19]). However, OPC UA requires careful configuration of numerous security settings, and incautious decisions can lead to weak or unsecured systems. In industrial deployments, such configurations can allow for well-known attacks, such as eavesdropping and data theft, and can also enable control over production lines, causing physical damage and harm to humans [28]. Configuration recommendations [52], such as the use of ciphers, aim to mitigate the spread of insecure deployments.

Until now, it has been unclear whether system operators adhere to these security recommendations and prevent unauthorized access to modern industrial deployments. Active Internet-wide scanning has proven to be a valuable and accepted method to assess security configurations [23, 31, 57, 61]. Similarly, various studies have identified the risks of Internet-connected industrial devices using legacy protocols without security features [3, 20, 44].

This motivates us to combine these research streams to analyze the security configurations of industrial deployments. In this paper, we study whether Internet-connected OPC UA deployments and their configurations leverage the strong security provided by the protocol design [19]. To achieve this, we actively scan the complete IPv4 address space for publicly reachable OPC UA systems and subsequently assess the security configurations of the found deployments.

### Contributions
Our main contributions are as follows:
- We perform weekly measurements of the complete IPv4 address space over seven months to detect OPC UA devices, which we can attribute to well-known industrial manufacturers and sectors, such as building automation and power systems.
- We evaluate the security configurations of Internet-facing OPC UA devices following official security guidelines and recommendations. Our results show that 92% of OPC UA systems are configured inadequately, e.g., due to missing access control, disabled security functionality, use of deprecated cryptographic primitives, or certificate reuse.
- We release our anonymized dataset [11] and our OPC UA extensions of zgrab2 [9] to allow for reproducibility of our results.

## 2 A Primer on OPC UA and Security
OPC UA, a relatively new industrial protocol, offers significant functional improvements over prior protocols, such as cross-vendor communication and platform independence. It is the first widely-deployed industrial protocol with built-in and attested security [19], enabling secure remote access.

To facilitate platform-independent communication between industrial devices from different manufacturers, OPC UA servers represent device functions, sensor values, and other variables as a set of nodes in an address space, where namespaces provide semantic information about the nodes [41]. Clients can dynamically request the execution of functions or data of variables from this address space. While OPC UA supports various communication paradigms and interfaces, such as publish/subscribe or HTTP(S), we focus on the binary interface (standard port 4840 via TCP) because it is a mandatory feature of all OPC UA devices [49]. This interface implements security-specific mechanisms, such as authentication, access control, integrity protection, and confidentiality [50].

Figure 1 illustrates the establishment of a secure connection in OPC UA, focusing on the security primitives provided by an OPC UA server to clients. First, since OPC UA servers can provide data via different endpoints, clients request a list of endpoints with descriptions of their security configurations. The response includes a certificate that authenticates the server. After choosing an endpoint, the client establishes a secure channel using the channel parameters in the endpoint description.

The security mode in the endpoint description enables or disables confidentiality and/or authentication for communication. Establishing a secure channel allows the client to authenticate to the server via a certificate, optionally implementing the first level of access control. Table 1 lists the security policies defining the cryptographic primitives for the secure channel establishment, such as hash function and key length.

After establishing a secure channel, clients create a session for subsequent data transmissions. To access the server’s address space, clients must authenticate (using user credentials, a certificate, or an authentication token) unless anonymous access is enabled. Depending on the authenticated user, OPC UA servers can enforce different access control rules at the granularity of single nodes.

Although OPC UA’s protocol design is secure [19], its various configuration options can significantly impact security. Official recommendations aim to improve this situation [52]: Communication security should never be disabled, i.e., signed and encrypted communication should be used whenever possible. Anonymous authentication should be forbidden, and only three of the six available security policies should be used, as one provides no security and two have been deprecated due to the use of SHA-1 (cf. Table 1). Therefore, it is crucial to verify that OPC UA deployments follow these recommendations.

The benefits of a global view on the security configuration of OPC UA deployments are highlighted by research on the security of Internet-facing industrial appliances and Internet-wide security analyses for Web protocols.

### Security of Industrial Deployments
Various studies have identified security issues in industrial deployments [6, 26, 33, 53, 56, 62]. Although actual security incidents are rare [43], a single incident can be catastrophic [45]. Mirian et al. [44] found tens of thousands of industrial devices connected to the Internet via legacy and insecure protocols. These devices include programmable logic controllers [20] and robots controllable via the Internet [13].

Internet scan projects, such as Censys [15] and Shodan [59], offer metadata about all Internet-connected devices, including industrial deployments [25, 40], and can detect new industrial devices within a month [3]. Several studies have analyzed Shodan’s data on industrial devices to assess their security, finding a large number of devices affected by known software vulnerabilities, e.g., in the Netherlands [5], Finland [37], and worldwide [24]. These works consider industrial devices using legacy industrial protocols.

Devices using these legacy and insecure industrial protocols are often subject to scanning activities [4, 17, 35]. While standard scanning tools, such as zmap [16], may not necessarily affect normal operations of industrial devices [8], malicious activities can compromise unprotected devices.

Nawrocki et al. observed communication over legacy industrial protocols at IXP level and found that 96% of messages originated from industrial devices [45], emphasizing the need for secure industrial communication. Assessment guidelines and tools assist operators in correctly configuring secure industrial protocols such as OPC UA [30, 52, 55].

However, it remains an open question whether OPC UA deployments actually capitalize on increased security functionality compared to legacy industrial protocols that provide no security.

### Internet Security Measurements
Active and passive measurements have proven useful for insights into the deployment and (mis-)configuration of security protocols. Various studies have examined TLS deployments, including the TLS and certificate configuration of Internet-facing embedded devices [57], and the shift to newer versions and features [1]. Related work has also analyzed security certificates regarding configuration [32], validity [7], wrong issuance [38], and certificate transparency logs [22].

In addition, Internet measurements have been used to find insecurely configured embedded devices [10], detect compromised IoT devices [42, 46, 58], and study cloud usage and communication security of IoT devices [54]. Motivated by these observations, we set out to study whether modern Internet-facing industrial appliances using the OPC UA protocol capitalize on the promised increases in security.

## 4 OPC UA Scanning & Dataset
Our methodology to analyze the security configuration of Internet-facing OPC UA deployments involves weekly scans of the complete IPv4 address space on the default OPC UA binary protocol port (TCP, 4840), as implementing the binary protocol is mandatory for all OPC UA instances [49]. By performing weekly scans, we can observe changes, such as software updates and certificate renewals. During both design and execution, we follow principles of ethical research and established best practices for Internet-wide active measurements (cf. Appendix A). Whenever possible, we inform operators of insecure systems to prevent future harm.

### Scanner
We use zmap to detect Internet-facing systems with an open TCP port 4840 and zgrab2, which we extended with OPC UA functionality based on gopcua, to connect to the found servers (0.5‰ of hosts with an open TCP port 4840 actually run OPC UA). Subsequently, we retrieve information on the provided endpoints, their security configuration, i.e., available security modes, security policies, and authentication tokens, and establish a secure channel. If a server offers the security policy Sign or SignAndEncrypt, we send a self-signed certificate during the secure channel handshake. We also connect to other host/port combinations listed as endpoints on scanned OPC UA servers (as of 2020-05-04). For each server with anonymous access enabled, we traverse through the offered address space to retrieve all nodes and their access rights.
