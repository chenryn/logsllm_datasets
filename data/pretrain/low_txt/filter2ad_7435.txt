## Abstract
The use and prevalence of cloud and large-scale computing infrastructures are increasing and are projected to be a dominant trend in computing for the foreseeable future. Major cloud operators now house millions of machines each and host substantial (and growing) fractions of corporate and government IT and web infrastructure. The CCSW (Cloud Computing Security Workshop) is a forum that brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss the challenges and implications of current and future trends on the security of cloud operators, tenants, and the broader Internet community. Of particular interest are the security challenges arising from the integration of cloud infrastructures with IoT and mobile application deployments. CCSW welcomes submissions on new threats, countermeasures, and opportunities brought about by the move to cloud computing, with a preference for unconventional approaches, as well as measurement studies and case studies that shed light on the security implications of cloud infrastructure and use cases.

## Keywords
- Cloud Computing
- Security

## 1. Motivation
Regardless of the latest buzzwords (grid, cloud, utility computing, SaaS, etc.), large-scale computing and cloud-like infrastructures are here to stay. While the exact form they will take in the future remains to be determined by the market, it is clear that clouds bring new, untested deployment models and associated adversarial models and vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is essential for our community to engage with these issues. CCSW is an ideal venue for this engagement due to its often avant-garde position in the broader security landscape. According to Google Scholar, four of the top 20 cited ACM CCS papers over the past five years have come from CCSW.

## 2. Topical Coverage
ACM CCSW is a forum for presenting novel research or empirical studies from academia, industry, and government on all theoretical and practical aspects of security, privacy, and data protection in cloud scenarios. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Secure cloud resource virtualization
- Secure data management outsourcing
- Practical privacy and integrity mechanisms for outsourcing
- Cloud-centric threat models
- Secure outsourced computation
- Remote attestation mechanisms in clouds
- Sandboxing and VM-based enforcements
- Trust and policy management in clouds
- Secure identity management mechanisms
- Cloud-aware web service security paradigms and mechanisms
- Cloud-centric regulatory compliance issues and mechanisms
- Business and security risk models for clouds
- Cost and usability models and their interaction with cloud security
- Scalability of secure clouds
- Trusted computing technology and clouds
- Analysis of software for remote attestation and cloud protection
- Network security (DoS, IDS, etc.) mechanisms for clouds
- Security for cloud programming models
- Privacy-enhancing machine learning in clouds
- Secure and privacy-protecting IoT clouds
- Accountable Data Analytics for clouds

We especially encourage novel paradigms and controversial ideas that are not on the above list. The workshop aims to serve as a fertile ground for creative debate and interaction in security-sensitive areas of computing impacted by clouds.
