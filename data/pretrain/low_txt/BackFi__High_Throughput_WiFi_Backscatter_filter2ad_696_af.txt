### Source Data and Network Scenarios

The source data [24, 47, 41] captures a wide variety of scenarios for heavily loaded networks. In the case where an Access Point (AP) is not loaded and there is a significant amount of idle channel time, a BackFi AP can initiate backscatter communication by sending dummy packets. The more interesting scenario is when the network is loaded, and backscatter opportunities are limited due to contention.

### Trace Filtering and Replay

Next, we filter the traces to include only AP transmissions. We then replay the collected trace using our WARP-based BackFi AP implementation to simulate the same traffic conditions. In other words, in our emulated experiment, the WARP radio transmits only when the corresponding AP transmitted in the collected trace. We place a BackFi tag at a fixed distance of 2 meters from the BackFi AP and activate the tag only when the AP is transmitting. We repeat this experiment for each of the 20 different APs we captured traces for. For each replay, we calculate the average throughput obtained by the BackFi link. Figure 12(a) plots the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of these throughputs.

### Throughput Analysis

In a loaded network, the BackFi link can achieve a median throughput of 4 Mbps. For a range of 2 meters, the optimal throughput when the BackFi AP continuously transmits an excitation signal is 5 Mbps. This means that under realistic WiFi network conditions, the BackFi link achieves 80% of the optimal throughput. This performance can be further improved if more WiFi devices have BackFi functionality. Specifically, the above experiment assumed that only the AP has BackFi functionality. If we integrate BackFi into laptops and smartphones, turning them into gateways for BackFi links, the BackFi link can be active for larger fractions of time.

### Impact on WiFi Network

A natural question is whether BackFi affects the performance of the WiFi network itself when the AP is doubling up as a WiFi backscatter reader. One might imagine that the tags' backscattered signals could propagate to the actual WiFi client, which is the destination of the transmission from the AP, and act as interference.

To quantify the impact on a general WiFi network, we place the BackFi AP and ten clients at random locations in the testbed. We then place the tag at increasing distances from the AP and calculate the WiFi throughput with and without an active BackFi tag. We repeat this experiment for 30 different configurations of the AP and the clients. Figure 12(b) plots the throughputs with and without an active BackFi tag for different ranges between the BackFi AP and the tag. The results confirm that when the tag and the AP reader are extremely close (between 0.25 and 0.5 meters), there is a small impact on network throughput of less than 10%. Otherwise, the normal WiFi network performance is negligibly affected since the backscattered signals are so weak.

### Micro-benchmark Impact on WiFi

We now evaluate the worst-case scenario for the WiFi client, which corresponds to the case where the tag is very close to the AP (at a distance of 0.25 meters) because the backscattered signals would be the strongest. We take a single WiFi client and place it at different distances to achieve different WiFi bitrates. For each WiFi bitrate, we evaluate the Physical Layer (PHY) throughput achieved with and without a BackFi tag being active. Figure 13(a) plots the CDF of WiFi throughputs achieved for this link with and without a BackFi tag active. As we can see, the effect is minimal. The only noticeable difference is when the WiFi AP and the client are using the highest bitrate of 54 Mbps, where small decreases in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) can force the WiFi AP to occasionally switch to lower bitrates.

### Conclusion and Future Work

BackFi provides a high-throughput, long-range, and low-power backscatter communication link using ambient WiFi signals. The range and throughput of BackFi can be further enhanced with the use of multiple antennas at the WiFi APs, as multiple antennas provide additional diversity combining gain. We can incorporate multiple antennas at the AP with minimal changes to BackFi’s link layer protocol. Specifically, each transmit antenna would need a silent slot to eliminate the environmental component corresponding to that antenna. We can exploit existing WiFi MIMO packet structure for estimating the environment, as it has preamble slots where only one transmit antenna is active. We can then perform Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) for the signals received across space from multiple antennas, providing BackFi with better SNR.

We believe that the combination of performance and piggybacking on existing signals demonstrated by BackFi can bring us closer to the vision of ubiquitous RF-powered computing and communication gadgets in the physical world. However, much work remains in realizing this vision, including designing protocols to manage a network of BackFi tags connected to an AP and developing techniques to balance sensing, computing, and communication needs within a constrained energy budget. This continues to be our future work.
