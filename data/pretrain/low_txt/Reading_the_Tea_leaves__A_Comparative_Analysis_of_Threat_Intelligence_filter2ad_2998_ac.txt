### Matrix Asymmetry and Time Sensitivity of IP Threats

The matrix is asymmetric because, in general, \( \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A|} \neq \frac{|A \cap B|}{|B|} \). The elements of the matrix are ordered as shown in Table 1.

### Finding: Pairwise Intersections in Scan and Brute-Force Feeds

Feeds in the scan and brute-force categories exhibit higher pairwise intersections. Specifically, half of the pairwise intersections in these categories involve scan and brute-force feeds.

### Time Sensitivity of IP Threats

An event originating from an IP address, such as scanning activity or a brute-force attack, is not perpetual. If one scan feed reports an IP address today and another feed reports the same IP three months later, it would be impractical to consider them as part of the same event. Distinguishing between events is challenging, but we use a one-month window to restrict an event, assuming that the same attack from one source will not last more than 30 days. This threshold, while arbitrary, provides a reasonably conservative measure, and other thresholds produced similar results.

To calculate relative latency, we track the first occurrence of IPs in all feeds within a category and record the latency of subsequent occurrences, excluding those that occur after 30 days. By using the first appearance of each IP as the base, we avoid the uncertainty caused by multiple occurrences and varying valid periods among feeds.

### Relative Latency Distribution

Figures 2a and 2b show the relative latency distribution among feeds in the scan and brute-force categories, measured in hours. We focus on feeds that share over 10% of their data with others to ensure the analysis represents the overall latency distribution. One feed in each category (PA Snort BlockList in scan and PA Brute-Force in brute-force) is excluded from the figures.

### Finding: Fastest and Slowest Feeds

From the distribution boxes, we can see that Paid IP Reputation in the scan category and Badips SSH in the brute-force category are the fastest, with the lowest median and 75th percentile latencies. Conversely, PA Analyst in the scan category and Badips Badbots in the brute-force category are the slowest. Figure 2a shows that all scan feeds except one have their 25th percentile latency equal to 0, indicating that they reported a significant portion of their shared data first. A similar pattern is observed in the brute-force category.

### Feed Size and Latency

It is reasonable to ask whether larger feeds report data sooner than smaller ones. Our results show that this is not always the case. For example, FB Aggregator1, the second smallest feed in the scan category, is no slower than several other feeds with over 10 times its daily rate. In contrast, Badips Badbots, which has the second-largest rate in the brute-force category, is slower than all other feeds in the same category. Smaller feeds can still report a significant amount of their data first.

### Data Copying and Latency

Another factor affecting latency is whether feeds copy data from each other. For instance, 93% of Dangerrulez Brute also appears in Badips SSH. If this were the case, we would expect Dangerrulez Brute to be faster. However, our comparison showed that Badips SSH reported 88% of their shared indicators first. We conducted this pairwise latency comparison for all feeds and found that a significant proportion of indicators is still unique to each feed. When aggregating the data, 73% of all scan feed indicators and 88% of brute-force feed indicators are unique to a single feed. For other categories, over 97% of elements are unique to a single feed. This result aligns with previous work indicating that most data in threat intelligence feeds is unique [26, 42].

### Latency in Other Categories

Relative latency can only be calculated for indicators that occur in at least two feeds. As discussed in Section 3.4, the number of common indicators in botnet, malware, exploit, and spam feeds is very low (fewer than 3% of elements occur in more than one feed). Therefore, relative latency calculations for these feeds are less meaningful. For this analysis, we focus on scan, brute-force, and malware feeds, where Paid IP Reputation shares non-trivial data with a few small feeds in the malware category. No clear latency advantage was observed between any two feeds. Note that this observation does not prove there is no data copying, as shared data might partially come from copying and partially from the feeds' own data collection. Our latency analysis is at a one-hour granularity.

### Accuracy of Feeds

Accuracy measures the rate of false positives in a feed. A false positive is an indicator labeled with a category to which it does not belong. For example, an IP address in a scan feed that has not conducted any Internet scanning is a false positive. Even if an IP is associated with malicious activity, if it is not unambiguously actionable (e.g., Google’s DNS at 8.8.8.8), it must also be treated as a false positive. False positives can lead to adverse operational consequences, such as blocking legitimate connections.

Determining which IPs belong in a feed and which do not can be extremely challenging. Instead, we use a whitelist of IP addresses that should not reasonably be included in a feed or, if included, would cause significant disruption. We define an upper bound on a feed’s accuracy by populating our list from three sources: unroutable IPs, IPs associated with top Alexa domains, and IPs of major content distribution networks (CDNs).

### Unroutable IPs

Unroutable IPs are IP addresses that were not BGP-routable when they first appeared in a feed, as established by contemporaneous data in the RouteViews service [44]. While including unroutable addresses in a feed is not inherently problematic, their inclusion suggests a quality control issue, casting doubt on the validity of other indicators in the feed.

To allow for some delays, we check if an IP was routable at any time in the seven days prior to its first appearance in a feed. If it was, we do not count it as unroutable. Table 2, column "Unrt," shows the fraction of IP indicators that were not routable at any time in the seven days prior to appearing in the feed. This analysis is only conducted for IPs added after our measurement started. The number of such IPs is shown in column "Added."

### Summary

- **Matrix Asymmetry**: \( \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A|} \neq \frac{|A \cap B|}{|B|} \)
- **Pairwise Intersections**: Higher in scan and brute-force feeds
- **Time Sensitivity**: One-month window for event restriction
- **Relative Latency**: Calculated based on first appearances, with smaller feeds often reporting data first
- **Data Copying**: Partially affects latency, but no clear advantage observed
- **Accuracy**: Measured using a whitelist of unroutable IPs, top Alexa domains, and CDNs

This structured approach provides a clearer and more professional presentation of the findings and analysis.
