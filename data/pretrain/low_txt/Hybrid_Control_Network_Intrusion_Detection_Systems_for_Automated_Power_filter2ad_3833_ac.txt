## A. Introduction to the HC-NIDS Implementation

In the previous section, we introduced the use of Bro IDS [17] to implement the HC-NIDS, which is the core component of our system. We utilized Bro's Turing-complete language to define our intrusion detection rules in the form of policy scripts. The final part of our experimental implementation involves a set of scenarios that demonstrate the HC-NIDS's ability to detect various types of attacks. For this purpose, we developed a Modbus Master Simulator in C, which acts as the attacker in the FLISR system. We assume that the attacker initiates a connection with the slave controller during periods when there is no packet exchange between the two controllers.

## B. Intrusion Detection Using Communication Information

### 1. DoS Attempt

The primary goal of a DoS (Denial of Service) attack is to render the slave controller unavailable to its intended master controller. Under the assumption that the attacker sends queries to the slave controller, the HC-NIDS analyzes the network traffic and checks for expected traffic patterns. If the HC-NIDS detects queries from an unauthorized IP address, it generates an alarm to notify the network administrator about the suspicious activity.

### 2. Data Memory Access

In this attack scenario, the attacker aims to probe the status of physical devices to gather data for further actions, such as causing power outages. We assume the attacker has obtained the FLISR master’s IP address and sends a "read" command request. The HC-NIDS checks if the "read" command function code is on the list of acceptable function codes. If not, it generates an alarm indicating an attempted illicit action.

## C. Intrusion Detection Using Physical Information

### 1. De-energizing the Distribution Feeder

In this attack, the attacker attempts to de-energize the entire distribution feeder by opening the main feeder circuit breaker (CB). We assume the attacker has retrieved information about the FLISR network configuration, including the controllers' IP addresses, memory allocation, and mapping to physical devices, and the used command function codes. However, the attacker is unaware of the communication procedure for FLISR physical operations. Based on the network traffic, the attacker sends a "write" command request to open the CB. Although the attempt passes the three intrusion detection rules (controllers' IP addresses, command function codes, and operation cycle duration), the HC-NIDS detects that the initial packet is not followed by an opening command to the sectionalizing switches (SSs). This inconsistency with the normal FLISR operation procedure triggers an alert.

### 2. Causing Power Outage for Intended Load Points

In this attack, the attacker aims to cause a power outage for specific load points by isolating certain line sections. We assume the attacker knows the controllers' IP addresses, the used command function codes, and the physical operation procedure of FLISR. However, the attacker is unaware of the FLISR operation cycle duration. The attacker generates a sequence of packets with the master controller’s IP address and the used command function codes. First, the attacker sends a "write" command request to activate the CB, followed by a second "write" command request to activate specific SSs. The HC-NIDS observes the time gap between these queries and detects that it is inconsistent with the expected time gap. This observation triggers an alert indicating a possible malicious action. Figure 4 illustrates the timing difference between normal network traffic and simulated attacks, showing that attack packets have larger time gaps, making them identifiable compared to normal traffic.

## D. A Sophisticated Insider Attack Scenario

This attack is similar to the one causing power outages for specific load points, but we now assume the attacker has complete knowledge of the FLISR process, including the controllers' IP addresses, command function codes, physical operation procedure, and operation cycle duration. The attacker can send queries that are consistent with the system's expected behavior at both the network and application layers. Just before the master controller initiates a new block of packets, the attacker takes over the connection and initiates a block of packets that mimic the observed features of the FLISR network traffic.

Detecting this attack requires additional data to validate adherence to circuit conservation laws, as stated in the fifth rule in subsection III.B. However, since we are only monitoring one communication path, the HC-NIDS does not receive sufficient information about currents, voltages, and power flows to check for consistency with these laws.

## V. Concluding Remarks and Future Work

Securing Advanced Distribution Systems (ADSs) is crucial due to the severe impacts security breaches can have on their performance and economics. To assess and protect ADSs more effectively, it is necessary to utilize information from both the physical and network aspects of the system for intrusion detection. Our paper highlights the importance of including physical system operation data, embedded in the application layer, and network traffic data in intrusion detection rules. While this work focuses on smart grid ADS applications, the proposed approach can be applied to other smart grid applications and various cyber-physical systems. Future work will aim to enhance the HC-NIDS with detailed physical data on voltages, currents, and power flows, allowing us to implement intrusion detection rules based on physical laws valid on the grid. This would improve the HC-NIDS's capabilities in detecting sophisticated attacks and scenarios targeting geographically distributed physical devices.
