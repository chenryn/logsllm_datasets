## APT Attribution

### Disclaimer
- No opinions on recent indictments, 奶黄包, 楼主, or 上海钟楼.
- For more information, visit [espionageware.blogspot.com] or follow [@espionageware] on Twitter.
- This topic is more relevant for law enforcement (LE) or intelligence agencies rather than the private sector.
- Attribution is not difficult if you have the source code.
- It is relatively straightforward if you focus on strings and human-readable data within a malware program.
- However, attributing responsibility with "certainty" is nearly impossible unless the attacker makes a mistake.

### Source Code Attribution
- **Stylometry:** The application of authorship attribution by coding style.
- **Comments and Coding Crumbs:** Useful for profiling.
- **JStylo:** Compares unknown documents with known candidate authors' documents.
- **Limitation:** Most APT samples are compiled binaries, making this method less effective.

### Attributes of Windows Binaries
- **PE Headers:** Deconstructed to extract metadata (artifacts).
- **Technical and Contextual Attributes:** Grouping malware using different "layers."
- **Proprietary Reverse Engineering and Behavioral Analysis Technology:** Used for digital DNA.

### Identified APT Groups
- **Sensational Names for APT Actors:**
  - 2009: GhostNet
  - 2010: Operation Aurora
  - 2011: Lurid, Nitro, Night Dragon, 1.php, Shady RAT
  - 2013: Comment Crew/APT1, Soysauce, Deep Panda, Red October, Net Traveler, SAFE
  - 2014: PutterPanda, PittyTiger (likely not state-sponsored)

## Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP)

- **Attribution:** Tracking Cyber Spies & Digital Criminals (Hoglund, 2010).
- **Forensic Marks:** Extracted from raw data in three intelligence layers:
  - **Net Recon**
  - **Developer Fingerprints**
  - **TTP**
- **Human Factors:** TTP should carry the highest intelligence value for identifying human attackers.
- **Challenges:** Finding human actors with definitive intelligence is nearly impossible.
- **Social Cyberspace (DIGINT) and Physical Surveillance (HUMINT):** Key components in attribution.

### Boman's VXCAGE
- **Boman:** Extracts technical metadata from a large collection of binaries.
- **Database Storage:** Artifacts stored in a relational database for further analysis.
- **Behavioral Focus:** Emphasizes the behavior of the human behind the malware.

### TTP and the Pyramid of Pain
- **TTP:** Human-influenced factors.
- **Pyramid of Pain:** A model for understanding the difficulty of countering various types of threats.

## Behavior of APT Adversary

### APT Life Cycle (Kill Chain)
- **Domain Registration:** Follows meaningful Chinese PingYing (拼音) patterns.
- **DNS-IP Address Pairs:** Created and managed.
- **Friendly ISP:** Uses a portion of their C-class subnet.
- **Campaigns:** DNS names and IP addresses cycled for reuse.
- **Exploits:** Embed multiple DNS A-records.
- **Spear-Phishing Emails:** Prepared after reconnaissance.

### Assumed APT Infrastructure Tactics
- **Exploits:** Drop binaries that extract DNS records and communicate with C2 servers.
- **C2 Servers:** Register infections and collect preliminary information.
- **Intelligence Analysts:** Review collected information through C2 portals.
- **Exfiltration:** Instruct infected machines to gather further intelligence.
- **Infrastructure Changes:** Domain manipulation, Whois information, and parked domains.

### HUMINT Extracted from DNS & WHOIS
- **Domain Names:** A Record, Cname, NS record.
- **Whois Records:** Valid email address, name, street address, name servers.
- **Parked Domains:** Temporary IP address assigned for newly created domains.

### Intel Collection Process
- **Extract DNS:** From malicious code (sandbox).
- **Lookup IP Address:** Retrieve all parked-domains.
- **Whois Information:** Update identified records in a relational database.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Record all changes in the database.

### Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
- **Tools:**
  - Nslookup
  - Whois
  - Domain Tools: Reverse DNS and reverse whois
  - BGP.HE.NET
  - VirusTotal
  - PassiveDNS.Mnemonic.NO
  - Farsight Security
  - PassiveTotal

### Passive DNS to Passive WHOIS
- **Passive DNS:** Constructs zone replicas without cooperation from zone administrators.
- **Historical Data:** Stores and indexes historical DNS data.
- **VirusTotal:** Keeps passive DNS records from malicious samples.

### Analysis Using Visualization
- **Maltego:** Sample called Overprotect.

## Conclusion
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Of whois servers and DNS-IP address pairs.
- **TTP Adjustments:** Based on cultural background of attacker groups.
- **Intelligence Sharing:** Important for accurate attribution.
- **Actor Boundaries:** Blurred due to shared TTP and tools.
- **Espionage-as-a-Service:** Expected to increase.

### Is Attribution with Certainty Possible?
- **Value of TTP:** Highest for identifying human attackers.
- **Reliability Challenges:** Increased sharing of TTP and tools.
- **Intelligence Community:** Needs better understanding and sharing.

## Tools
- **MalProfile Script:** Grabs intelligence from the Internet.
- **Maltego Local Transforms:** Aids in the analysis process.

### Further Research
- **Plugins:** Allow for additional intelligence when new TTP is identified.
- **Class Modification:** To include technical context in intelligent analysis.
