## Simulation Setup
During the simulation, nodes roamed around the map according to a randomly generated direction and speed. The direction was uniformly distributed from 0° to 360°, and the speed ranged from 0 to a given maximum speed. The maximum speeds were 50 km/hour for the 5 × 5 map, 60 km/hour for the 6 × 6 map, and so on. Each data point in the plots represents the average of 30 independent experimental results.

## Objective
The objective of the simulations was to compare two proposed schemes for gossiping in wireless ad hoc networks: the linear scheme (denoted as "Linear") and the two-phase scheme (denoted as "TwoPhase"). Traditionally, the efficiency of a gossiping scheme is evaluated based on running time and the total number of message transmissions. However, since these gossiping schemes are designed to support middleware services such as failure detectors, which continue to operate as long as the overlaying system is active, the traditional concept of running time cannot be directly applied. In this study, the performance metric used is the reachability after time \( t \) has elapsed since the gossiping began, denoted as \( RE(t) \):

\[ RE(t) = \frac{\sum_{u \in V} \text{updated\_count}(u, t)}{N_t u} \]

where \( \text{updated\_count}(u, t) \) is the number of members in the heartbeat list of node \( u \) that have their heartbeat counter updated at least once before time \( t \). We use \( t \) as the x-coordinate and the corresponding reachability as the y-coordinate in Figures 3-10. This metric reflects the average accuracy of a failure detection service if the detection time of each member is set to \( t \).

## Performance in Static Topologies
Figures 3-6 show the comparison of the two schemes in networks with different densities. It can be observed that the reachability degrades gracefully due to the effect of message losses in all cases. The reachability curve of the linear scheme is smooth, while that of the two-phase scheme has a ladder-like shape due to the hierarchical way of message propagation. The differences in performance between the two schemes are small because the time to achieve almost 100% reachability is usually very short (about 20-30 seconds in our case). However, the two-phase scheme outperforms the linear scheme more significantly. We denote \( t_d \) as the minimum time (in seconds) that the average \( RE(t) \) is more than 0.9 for \( t \geq t_d \). In Figures 4-6, it can be observed that in most cases, \( t_d \) of the two-phase scheme is about 25%-35% shorter than that of the linear scheme with \( p = 0.0 \), and about 15%-25% shorter than that of the linear scheme with \( p = 0.1 \).

## Impact of Node Mobility and Higher Message Loss Probability
Next, we consider the impact of node mobility and higher message loss probability. Due to space constraints, only the experimental results in networks with medium density (s = 6) are shown here. Comparing Figures 7 and 8, we find that there is no dramatic performance degradation in both schemes even when \( p \) is up to 30%. Additionally, the two-phase scheme is more resilient to topology changes caused by nodes moving at modest speeds. The upper limit of the reachability curve is caused by node disconnections, as disconnected nodes were not excluded while calculating \( RE(t) \).

## Node Priority Policy
The proposed node priority policy was then verified. In Figures 9-10, the solid line represents the results of setting \( gw(p) = pid(p) \) for each node \( p \) in the two-phase scheme. The performance is apparently much worse, especially when \( s \) becomes larger. Finally, the simulation results by applying the heuristics described in Section 6.3 are also shown in Figures 9 and 10 with \( k = 1 \). It can be seen that the performance can indeed be improved by setting \( k \) to 1, especially in sparser networks, at the expense of a slightly heavier local traffic load.

## Concluding Remarks and Future Works
In this paper, we addressed the problem of providing communication strategies for heartbeat-style failure detectors in wireless ad hoc networks. We discussed two effective solutions for performing gossiping in wireless ad hoc networks under constraints on the message transmission rate for all mobile hosts. Disseminating gossip messages through a routing protocol is undesirable in wireless ad hoc networks due to the extra messages and power consumption required by any routing protocol, and the creation of hot spots by message routing, which can decrease network longevity. The proposed gossiping schemes are independent of any routing protocol. The linear scheme is intuitive and straightforward, while the two-phase scheme is built on a transient hierarchy constructed by assigning a direction to each edge periodically. This procedure can be performed in a localized manner, reducing interference among nodes. A simulation study was conducted to compare the two solutions in terms of reachability. Both schemes are resilient to message losses due to the use of local broadcast for gossip message propagation, allowing each mobile host to merge the information disseminated by its one-hop neighbors into its next gossip message. The two-phase scheme is more efficient, especially in sparse networks, and is more resilient to topology changes caused by mobile host movements.

The main contributions of this paper are:
1. Highlighting the need for efficient and robust gossiping mechanisms in a mobile wireless environment.
2. Proposing novel communication strategies for developing heartbeat-style failure detectors in wireless ad hoc networks.

For the failure detection services built on the proposed gossiping schemes, the Strong Completeness property can be satisfied since a crashed member will stop sending heartbeats. However, there is a trade-off between the speed and accuracy of failure detection, as the longer it takes to judge if a member has crashed, the fewer mistakes will be made due to delayed or lost gossip messages. Since this paper is a first-step work on this topic, no lower bounds on the number of rounds needed for gossiping are given, and finding a suitable detection time to (probabilistically) satisfy quantitative requirements on accuracy remains an open problem. These are important subjects for future study. Due to the robustness of our gossiping schemes, a conservative detection time can be set to \( D \times T_{\text{gossip}} \) (the value of \( D \) may be inaccurate due to topology changes). The gossiping schemes can be operated over a virtual infrastructure with a smaller diameter. A possible way is to use the estimated \( D \) and the estimated minimum length of the relaying paths generated in each round to decide the parameters. Another direction is to ask each node \( u \) to set a separate detection time for every other node \( v \) based on the heartbeat counter update frequency of \( v \) in the most recent \( r \) rounds. A mathematical analysis of the proposed schemes and a discussion of self-stabilization should also be interesting areas for future work.
