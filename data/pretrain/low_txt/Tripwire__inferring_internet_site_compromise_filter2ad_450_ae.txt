### 7. Discussion

While automated account registration was a means to an end for our study, it also holds potential value for others. This section provides more details on our registration results, lessons learned, and the requirements for scaling such a system. Additionally, we discuss what an attacker would need to do to evade detection by a Tripwire-like system and the data and sources we are making available.

#### 7.1 Site Eligibility

To determine the proportion of sites eligible for a Tripwire-like system, we manually visited three sets of 100 sites from the Alexa rankings, starting with ranks 1, 1,000, and 10,000. The results are summarized in Table 4. On average, 6.7% of the pages failed to load, and 44.3% of the pages were not in English. Nearly 13% of the sites did not support web registration, and 5% required a credit card or other information that Tripwire cannot provide. Ultimately, fewer than a third of the sites were suitable candidates for automated account registration.

One notable trend is the significant decline in the fraction of sites with viable registration pages, from 43% in the top-100 to 18% at the top-10,000. This trend does not affect the percentage of load failures and non-English sites, indicating that sites become less useful for registrations as one moves down the Alexa ranking. Search engines may be an alternative source of sites to monitor, though we did not use them in this study.

#### 7.2 Extending the Crawler

Figure 3 illustrates the funnel of website registration attempts, from the full set of URLs supplied to the automated account registration system to the resulting set of successfully registered accounts. We input sites to the crawler with only the URL and Alexa rank. The crawler ignores non-English or otherwise ineligible sites. The first third of the figure breaks down the reasons the crawler is unable to register for an account, estimated to be about 64% of cases (see Table 4). Our crawler fails to find a registration page in about 69.2% of cases. In a manual inspection of 181 sites where it failed, we found valid registration pages on only eight, consistent with an estimated false negative rate of around 5%.

For high-value sites, such as very popular ones, we augmented the automated process with manual registrations. We consider this additional effort well worth the cost, as registrations need only occur once.

#### 7.3 Evading Tripwire

The results presented in this paper have the advantage that no system like Tripwire has previously existed, making it unlikely that attackers would try to evade detection. However, future implementations will need to consider evasion techniques. An informed attacker could avoid Tripwire detection by:

- Compromising user databases of sites not under measurement.
- Avoiding logins with the email provider or testing only a small sample of accounts.
- Testing other accounts instead of the email account (e.g., on social networks).
- Avoiding checking accounts with the known email provider.
- Forming a blacklist of Tripwire accounts if they can compromise the Tripwire operator or email provider.

For ethical and transparency reasons, we registered accounts with IP addresses clearly owned by our institution. An operational deployment should use plausible IPs to avoid detection.

#### 7.4 Data and Source Availability

Tripwire uses various heuristics to find and fill registration forms and handle incoming email. The source code for the crawler is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/ccied/tripwire). We have also provided an anonymized version of the login data, which includes an entry for each login event with the account alias, timestamp, /24 of the accessing IP, and login method. This anonymization balances transparency and the protection of the Tripwire sample accounts.

### 8. Conclusions

Website security is a critical issue with growing personal and financial impacts. While preventing and containing account compromises is essential, there will always be a risk of further exploits. We have shown that passive monitoring for compromises at a wide range of sites can detect breaches that site operators may be unaware of or unwilling to disclose. A major open question is how much evidence produced by an external monitoring system like Tripwire is needed to convince operators to act, such as notifying users and forcing a password reset.
