**Modeling Service Level Agreements with Linked USDL Agreement**

**Jose´ Mar´ıa Garc´ıa, Pablo Ferna´ndez, Carlos Pedrinaci, Manuel Resinas, Jorge Cardoso, and Antonio Ruiz-Corte´s**

**Abstract—** The increasing momentum of service trading over the Web necessitates formalizing the contractual and legal relationships between providers and consumers through Service Level Agreements (SLAs). While existing models address technical aspects, they often lack explicit semantics for agreement terms and do not adhere to Web principles, hindering their adoption and automatic analysis. In this article, we introduce Linked USDL Agreement, a semantic model for specifying, managing, and sharing SLA descriptions on the Web. This model, part of the Linked USDL family of ontologies, encompasses both technical and business-related aspects of services, incorporating Web principles. We validate our proposal by describing agreements in computational and non-computational scenarios, such as cloud computing and business process outsourcing services. Additionally, we evaluate the coverage and expressiveness of Linked USDL Agreement compared to existing models. To facilitate its adoption and effective management of the SLA lifecycle, we present an implemented tool that supports the creation, automatic analysis, and publication of agreement descriptions on the Web.

**1. Introduction**

Although the service economy is of paramount importance in developed countries and electronic commerce over the Web has been widely adopted, service trading is still largely manual [1]. Tasks such as searching for services, analyzing their characteristics, or customizing contracts including SLAs are generally performed manually. An SLA defines the guaranteed level of a service property (e.g., availability and response time) and the consequent actions in case of non-compliance, including compensations and liability issues [1].

In this article, we present Linked USDL Agreement, an extension to the Linked USDL family of ontologies that provides domain-independent means for describing SLAs. This model captures the semantics of these agreements, addressing heterogeneity and interoperability issues in current SLA specifications. Furthermore, Linked USDL Agreement follows Linked Data principles [5], serving as a fundamental building block for online service trading. It facilitates both customers and providers to publish, search for, analyze, reuse, and manage SLAs involved in any service transaction, thereby supporting the SLA lifecycle more effectively than other alternatives [6].

Linked USDL, designed as a modular and extensible family of ontologies, offers facilities to support the modeling, processing, and sharing of service descriptions openly on the Web. However, it does not currently cover the capture of agreement contracts between participants in a service transaction. SLAs are among the most relevant of these contracts. The rest of the article is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related work in the field of SLAs and introduces Linked USDL. Section 3 presents the requirements and motivating scenarios that have driven this work. Section 4 thoroughly describes the Linked USDL Agreement module. Section 5 evaluates our proposal, while Section 6 showcases the implemented tooling. Finally, Section 7 presents conclusions and future work.

**2. Related Work**

**2.1 The Linked USDL Family**

Linked USDL [2, 3] is a family of Web vocabularies or modules built upon the experience acquired with USDL, combined with research on business ontologies, Semantic Web Services, and Linked Data. It aims to better support trading at Web scale [1]. Linked USDL is grounded on two fundamental principles: i) the use of Linked Data [5] for representing and publishing service descriptions and relevant entities, and ii) the exploitation of lightweight formal ontology representation languages to represent the semantics of services and relevant entities. 

Linked Data principles provide best practices for sharing data effectively on the Web, dictating the use of URIs to name things, HTTP URIs for lookup, and the provision of useful information using open standards like RDF and SPARQL. These principles promote reuse, reducing the overhead of data modeling and creating a Web of interlinked, machine-processable data.

Linked USDL is mostly modeled using RDF/RDFS constructs, with a limited inclusion of abstract concepts to ensure simplicity and scalability. It builds upon complementary networked vocabularies, such as DC Terms, Time Ontology, Minimal Service Model, GoodRelations, and Schema.org, among others. Relying on Linked Data standards and semantic representations allows for the seamless creation and attachment of dedicated extensions, or modules, to Linked USDL Core on an on-demand and distributed basis.

**2.2 Service Level Agreement Models**

While Linked USDL Core provides essential facilities for describing and managing services, it was designed to support and promote the use of topic-specific and domain-specific extensions to accommodate various needs. SLA management is one such aspect requiring a specific extension. Some preliminary work has been done towards transforming Linked USDL Business Policies to WS–Agreement [10], but it does not cover compensation elements supported in our proposal. Marquezan et al. [11] extended Linked USDL with a Transport and Logistics SLA Vocabulary, which is domain-specific and does not support common SLA terms like penalties. Both proposals highlight the need for an extension to Linked USDL to describe domain-independent SLAs.

Apart from USDL, several languages and models exist for specifying SLAs, such as WSLA [12] and WS–Agreement [13], introduced by IBM and the Global Grid Forum, respectively. WS–Agreement, an evolution of WSLA, provides a specification framework with extension mechanisms to create fully-fledged SLA languages. However, these approaches often assume the availability of a WSDL description, which is deprecated in favor of Web APIs for automated services and often non-existent for manual, real-world services.

**3. Requirements and Motivating Scenarios**

**3.1.1 Shared Meaning of Content**

Providers and consumers need to speak the same "language" for effective service trading. Therefore, service descriptions must be specified using a shared representation schema and expressed in mutually understandable terms and concepts. Existing SLA languages focus only on the first requirement, using XML-based approaches that do not benefit from the inferential capabilities of semantic representations. Linked Data, designed to support the publication, search, and interpretation of schemas and content in a machine-understandable form over the Web, addresses this issue. For example, the ITIL vocabularies specify more than 600 IT-related terms that can be used within contracts to ensure a shared meaning of content.
