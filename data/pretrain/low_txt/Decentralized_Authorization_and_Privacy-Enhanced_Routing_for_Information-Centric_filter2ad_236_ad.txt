### Object Publication and Performance Analysis

The results of the object publication are summarized in Table 1. The time overhead introduced by signatures is minimal, while encryption has a more noticeable temporal overhead. However, when the capabilities have already been cached (a common scenario in practice), the overhead is significantly reduced because the expensive MA-ABE operations do not need to be performed. Additionally, the use of signatures introduces a small amount of bandwidth overhead due to the inclusion of certificates in node descriptions. The encryption bandwidth overhead is primarily due to the transmission of capabilities with each data object and the requests for MA-ABE encryption and decryption attributes.

### Macro-Benchmarking

To ensure repeatable tests, we used emulation to model real-world mobile performance on a Linux server. The same source code was cross-compiled to ARM code for Android and x86 binaries for Linux containers. We utilized the CPULimit tool with a threshold of 30% to slow down the Haggle processes to match the performance of our Android devices, as shown in Table 1. For resource isolation, node mobility modeling, and network emulation, we used CORE and EMANE. Haggle instances were started in virtual nodes that moved according to the scenario described below.

#### Scenario

The scenario, illustrated in Figure 4, runs for 900 seconds and involves two authority nodes (A1 and A2) and seven publishers (P1 to P7). At 1, 5, 11, and 16 seconds, one node from each group publishes a data object with an access policy involving both authorities. All nodes subscribe to these data objects, resulting in 112 intra-group deliveries and 136 inter-group deliveries. Starting at 21 seconds, seven intra-group data objects are published (with an access policy involving only one authority), leading to a total of 100 expected deliveries.

#### Results

Our emulation results are presented in Figure 5, which shows the number of data objects received over time. We tested five different configurations: no-security, signatures, signatures-static, encryption, and encryption-static. The static configurations refer to settings where nodes were pre-configured with the appropriate certificates and MA-ABE attributes, eliminating the need for SecurityDataRequests. These settings are useful in scenarios where the network topology is known beforehand.

In all configurations except encryption, publishing can start at time 1, as there is no need to wait for MA-BE attributes. Thus, the 212 intra-group deliveries can complete quickly. The remaining 136 inter-group deliveries, which require mules, take slightly longer to complete.

For the encryption configuration, publishing cannot start before time 21 due to the need for MA-ABE attributes. The initial 100 intra-group deliveries then complete gradually as publishers and subscribers obtain the necessary keys from the local authority. There are no further deliveries until the 250-second mark, when mules arrive with keys from the other group's authorities. Publishing then begins, and intra-group deliveries commence. By the 500-second mark, the rate of delivery increases as inter-group deliveries complete.

Signatures and encryption affect delivery latency, primarily due to the SecurityDataRequests and SecurityDataResponses that must travel through mules. With static provisioning, this overhead is eliminated, and the only additional latency is due to the time and space overhead seen in the micro benchmarks in Table 1.

### Related Work

In the 1980s and 1990s, the Internet was primarily used for point-to-point communication. After the advent of the Web, it was increasingly used for content distribution. In 2000, TRIAD [12] described the use of a content layer to handle routing, caching, and transformation. Directory service responses were authenticated with digital signatures, and communication between endpoints was protected at the network layer, similar to IPSec. OceanStore [20] proposed distributed access control using content encryption. Our framework subsumes this by protecting metadata integrity with signatures and limiting access to content via encryption.

By 2009, CCN [11] and its derivatives [19] had introduced flow balance, with interests being consumed by data flowing back to subscribers, providing resistance to denial of service attacks. In future work, we plan to leverage strong node identities to explore reputation tracking and anomaly detection for combating similar threats.

Our work differs from previous research on securing ICNs in several ways. We do not assume the existence of an external infrastructure for providing cryptographic keys [19]. Instead, each node defines its own identity (via self-generated signing and verification keys) attested by nodes deemed to be authorities. We also do not rely on authorization services for resolving access policies [15]. We use a cryptographic primitive that supports flexible specification of access control policies during encryption, allowing resolution as soon as content is available, rather than waiting for a policy server. Moreover, we provide the first ICN implementation of cryptographic access control supporting multiple, independent authorities. We enhance the privacy of individual interests, rather than just preventing surveillance at scale [4], and do not rely on self-certifying names for integrity assurance [17]. By decoupling naming from content identification, we allow flexible resolution of interests to content while providing strong assurance of content origin. Finally, we provide the first design and implementation of certified content lineage, allowing subscribers to identify and verify both the origin and the path through which content arrived from a publisher.

### Conclusion

We described the design, implementation, and evaluation of a security architecture for ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of content and the metadata that describes it. This metadata is used by brokers mediating between publishers and subscribers based on the match between content tags and node interests. Protecting this metadata is crucial to mitigate attacks on the privacy of publishers and subscribers, especially in environments where every node can serve as a publisher, broker, or subscriber.

We utilize multi-authority attribute-based encryption to reduce the access control problem to credential management. Nodes are issued credentials with their attributes (such as name, organization, or location) from one or more authorities. Access policies can be declared as any Boolean combination of node attributes, allowing publishers to scope access to content and descriptive tags. Subscribers can cryptographically limit the nodes that can access their interests.

Our work extends the Haggle opportunistic networking system. We report on the overhead added for ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of content on both Linux desktops and Android smartphones. We found that integrity protection does not add noticeable overhead, and typical confidentiality protection (where access policies have been previously defined) adds modest overhead. Publication with new access policies introduces latency but does not reduce the quantity of data objects transferred in a real scenario with mobile nodes.
