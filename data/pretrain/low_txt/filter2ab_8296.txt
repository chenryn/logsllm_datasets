**ATT&CK ID:** T1574.013  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** KernelCallbackTable

Adversaries may exploit the KernelCallbackTable of a process to hijack its execution flow and execute their own payloads. The KernelCallbackTable is located within the Process Environment Block (PEB) and is initialized with an array of graphical functions available to a GUI process after the `user32.dll` library is loaded. By modifying entries in this table, attackers can redirect the execution flow to their malicious code, thereby achieving persistence or executing arbitrary code.
