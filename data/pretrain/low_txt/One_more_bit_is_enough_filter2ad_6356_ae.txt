#### Adaptive Congestion Control Mechanisms

Several adaptive congestion control mechanisms have been proposed to address the challenges posed by varying network conditions. STCP [36] switches to a fixed MIMD (Multiple Instructions, Multiple Data) algorithm under changing conditions. FAST [31] employs queuing delay, similar to TCP Vegas [6], as its primary congestion signal instead of packet loss, and improves upon Vegas' Additive-Increase-Additive-Decrease (AIAD) policy using a proportional controller. BIC [67, 59] introduces a binary search phase into the standard TCP to logarithmically probe available bandwidth. LTCP [5] implements two-scale congestion control for high-speed, large Round-Trip Time (RTT) networks. TCP Westwood [8] enhances loss-based congestion detection with more robust bandwidth estimation techniques. These end-to-end schemes do not require explicit feedback, making it difficult for them to achieve both low persistent bottleneck queue length and near-zero congestion-induced packet loss. VCP, on the other hand, uses explicit two-bit ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) and can maintain low queue lengths and almost zero packet loss. However, it is unclear whether these end-to-end schemes, if supported by AQM/ECN, can match VCP's performance in high Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP) networks.

#### Analytical Results

The nonlinear optimization framework [37, 48, 41] provides a unified theoretical foundation for these schemes and proposes a class of control algorithms. The local stability of these algorithms under homogeneous delays has been studied by [32, 62], and extended to heterogeneous delays by [50]. A modified algorithm for heterogeneous delays was proven to be locally stable by [70], which developed a model similar to the one presented in Section 5. In contrast, this paper presents a global stability result for a single bottleneck with homogeneous delays. The global stability of more general congestion controllers has been explored by other researchers, such as [63, 12, 69].

Variable-structure control with sliding modes, a well-established concept in control theory [61], is useful when multiple system features are desired but no single algorithm can provide all of them. In computer networking, it has been applied to traffic engineering problems [43]. Our work extends this idea to network congestion control.

### Summary

In this paper, we introduce VCP, a simple, low-complexity congestion control protocol designed for high BDP networks. Through extensive ns2 simulations, we demonstrate that VCP achieves high utilization, reasonable fairness, low persistent bottleneck queue, and negligible packet loss rate. VCP accomplishes these desirable properties while requiring only two bits to encode network congestion information. By leveraging the two ECN bits, VCP requires no changes to the IP header, making it an extension of TCP+AQM/ECN proposals that scales to high BDP networks.

To better understand VCP's behavior, we propose a fluid model and use it to analyze the efficiency, fairness, and convergence properties of a simplified version of VCP. We prove that the model is globally stable for a single bottleneck link shared by long-lived flows with identical RTTs.

For future work, it would be interesting to explore how VCP could be improved by using more than two bits for congestion-related information. One possibility is to use a finer granularity encoding of the network load factor to enhance fairness convergence speed. While this paper evaluates VCP through extensive simulations, a real implementation and deployment will ultimately allow us to assess VCP's strengths and limitations.
