I am encountering an issue with Xcode 10, where my code, which runs smoothly on Xcode 9.4.1, fails to build. This problem persists whether I target iOS 11.4 or iOS 12. The source code can be accessed from this repository: [MedEasyAuth](https://github.com/Jeremywhiteley/MedEasyAuth).

Xcode's output is as follows:

- **Error**: Multiple commands produce '/Users/jeremywhiteley/Dropbox/MedDev/MedApp/medtexter_app/build/ios/Debug-iphonesimulator/Runner.app/Frameworks/Flutter.framework':
  - Target 'Runner' has a copy command from '/Users/jeremywhiteley/Dropbox/MedDev/MedApp/medtexter_app/ios/Flutter/Flutter.framework' to the specified destination.
  - This command depends on the script phase "[CP] Embed Pods Frameworks" in Target 'Runner'.
- **Warning**: The use of Swift 3 @objc inference in Swift 4 mode is deprecated. To resolve this, address the deprecated @objc inference warnings, test your code with "Use of deprecated Swift 3 @objc inference" logging enabled, and then disable inference by setting the "Swift 3 @objc Inference" build setting to "Default" for the "Runner" target.
- **Warning**: Ignoring duplicated output file: '/Users/jeremywhiteley/Dropbox/MedDev/MedApp/medtexter_app/build/ios/Debug-iphonesimulator/Runner.app/Frameworks/Flutter.framework'.
- **Note**: Using the new build system.
- **Note**: Planning build.
- **Note**: Constructing build description.

The application could not be built for the simulator, resulting in the following error when attempting to launch it on an iPhone X.
