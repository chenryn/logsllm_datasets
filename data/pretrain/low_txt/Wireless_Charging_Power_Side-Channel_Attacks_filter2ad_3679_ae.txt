### Differences and Susceptibility

Our research reveals several key differences. We found that the wireless side channel is as susceptible to a website fingerprinting attack as the traditional wired side channel. Additionally, we sampled at 700Hz instead of 250kHz, which allows our attack to be performed with less sophisticated hardware and makes it more difficult to detect. Our classifier can effectively classify current traces from different device and charger models without any preprocessing.

### Unique Side-Channel Attacks on Mobile Devices

The combination of hardware and sensor functionality in mobile devices leaves them vulnerable to unique side-channel attacks. Yan et al. [42] established a general exploitation approach for various power side-channel attacks on an Android smartphone. While our attack is based on this model, we also demonstrate its effectiveness on an Apple iPhone and do not require a wired connection, only the physical proximity needed for wireless charging.

Matyunin et al. [27] successfully identified applications running on a phone by analyzing how CPU operations affect magnetometer measurements. Yang et al. [43] showed that the transition between running apps leaves a side channel in memory that can be used to determine the executed application. Lifshits et al. [23] installed a malicious, power-monitoring battery in a smartphone to identify various types of activity. Qin et al. [32] also adopted a similar approach to smartphone website fingerprinting by using a malicious application that estimates power data fluctuations. The power estimation model employs CPU data that can be accessed without permission in Android 7. In contrast, our work does not require a malicious app or a compromised phone, as the act of wireless charging itself is vulnerable regardless of the permissions set by the operating system.

### Website Classification Methods

Another method of website classification, besides power side channels, is through traffic and hardware analysis. Unlike these approaches, our attack can occur without any software permissions. Hintz [16], Hayes and Danezis [15], and Lu et al. [25] measured the amount of encrypted data being transferred and other metadata to identify webpages, even in the presence of website fingerprinting defenses. Based on this work, Al-Shehari and Zhioua [3] proposed a unified model for traffic analysis attacks on computers. Our work also examines the Alexa top sites list [17] but differs in that the side channel exists locally on the phone’s hardware and is not a result of Internet traffic characteristics.

### Conclusion

This paper introduces a new side-channel attack that occurs when a Qi-compatible smart device is wirelessly charging and the power consumption of the wireless transmitter is recorded. We use a low-cost device to collect current traces and infer private information such as browser activity. We demonstrate that this attack can occur even if the user’s phone is not fully charged, requires no permission from the phone OS or user, and can be effective with current traces as short as 2.5 seconds. While this work explores a new side channel present in all wireless charging compatible smart devices, the full scope and constraints of the wireless charging side-channel attack and useful countermeasures need to be researched in future work.
