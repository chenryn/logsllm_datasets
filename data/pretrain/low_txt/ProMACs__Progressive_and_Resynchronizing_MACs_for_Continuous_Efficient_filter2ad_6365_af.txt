### 6.4 Computation, Energy, Storage, and Latency

In this section, we evaluate the computational and storage overheads, as well as the theoretical gains, associated with the Whips scheme.

#### Computation
Whips uses two separate Pseudorandom Functions (PRFs) for state updates and tag generation, which inherently adds computational overhead. For instance, if HMAC is used as the underlying PRF, Whips introduces an additional call to this primitive. 

To quantify this, we measured the execution time of HMAC-SHA256 for 15-byte messages and compared it to HMAC-SHA512, which is required by Whips. Additionally, we measured the execution time of the second PRF call on the internal state, which is 168 bytes in the robot control scenario. All experiments were repeated 1,000,000 times on current hardware (Intel i5 at 2.3 GHz).

Using a modern hash function, SHA3-512, the execution time for the first call was 5.2 μs (σ = 0.33 μs) for both SHA3-512 and SHA3-256. The subsequent PRF call generating the final tag took 6.1 μs (σ = 0.31 μs). 

Therefore, although Whips adds a second PRF call, the absolute computational overhead in terms of computation time is negligible.

#### Storage
In terms of storage, Whips is lightweight and easy to integrate into the intended use cases. Assuming an internal state of 168 bytes and a large Area of Dependency (AoD) of 20, Whips requires 3.4 kB of state storage. This can be easily managed even by constrained LoRaWAN sensors, which typically have 40 to 320 kB of RAM available [1].

#### Energy
Energy overhead is particularly relevant for battery-powered devices. For example, the Tmote Sky radio unit consumes significantly more power than the microcontroller, with approximately 4.762 mJ for PHY access and 1 μJ per transmitted byte [16]. By reducing transmission costs, Whips can achieve potential energy savings ranging from 21% for 128-bit tags, 31% for 64-bit tags, and up to 37% for 32-bit tags in the robot use case. These savings, combined with the avoidance of retransmissions through resynchronization, directly reduce battery drain and extend the lifetime of the devices.

#### Latency
In the robot control use case, transmitting a normal 20-byte MAC at 250 kbps results in a payload size of only 10 bytes, ignoring all headers, to meet the 1 ms delay requirement with 802.15.4. Using Whips, the payload size almost triples to 27 bytes. Alternatively, for a message size of 15 bytes, a 32-bit tag size allows transmission within 0.6 ms, maintaining or even enhancing security levels.

Finally, Whips can serve as a drop-in replacement for existing MAC schemes.

### 7 Summary

In this paper, we address the challenge of improving the performance of integrity checking for streamed messages upon reception. We introduce the concept of Progressive Message Authentication Codes (ProMACs) to provide security for drone and robot control, distributed control loops in Tactile Internet applications, and communication in resource-constrained environments. ProMACs integrate truncation for performance and state-chaining for increased security, while also offering inherent resynchronization capabilities. We propose a unique state update function that facilitates progressive verification of a message upon receiving subsequent tags.

Our new construction, Whips, constructs a tightly bound trust chain over the internal states, transmitting only a short tag. This allows for efficient transmission similar to truncated MACs but guarantees security at the same level as full-length MACs. By introducing flexibility in the number of incorporated previous states through the Area of Dependency, Whips enables resynchronization after verification errors or packet loss. The Area of Dependency covers only a sliding window of preceding messages, facilitating resynchronization after a specified number of verified messages following an error.

The presented ProMAC construction is suitable for replacing current MAC schemes, especially shortened tag systems, delivering the same performance with significantly increased security. We formally define the construction and prove its security and the security levels it can guarantee.

It is worth noting that the formalization of ProMACs extends the current MAC notion by balancing different types of statefulness, covering classical MACs and the tight statefulness of duplex-based constructions. We conducted an extensive empirical evaluation, demonstrating the applicability of the construction, the performance gains for realistic scenarios, and the effective security levels achieved under various packet error probabilities. Thus, we show that ProMACs satisfy all requirements of the described use cases.

In ongoing work, we are incorporating the ProMAC design into existing systems as a drop-in replacement to further evaluate its impact and provide effective integrity protection. We also plan further studies on the inherent semantics of the realized security levels, ultimately providing interpretations in various contexts. This will give a more precise meaning to the current confidence in the integrity of received packets and allow for the development of suitable reactions.
