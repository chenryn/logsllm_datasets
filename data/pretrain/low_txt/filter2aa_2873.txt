  - 5,500 sq ft of workshop space
  - Equipment and projects:
    - Laser cutter
    - Two 3D Z Corp printers
    - Drill presses, saws, soldering equipment, and workstations
    - 1,000-gallon saltwater tank and 1,000-gallon open touch tank
    - Bio/Chem laboratory
    - Green screen for video production and filmmaking
    - Cyberwar center/sandboxed servers

- **American Education Statistics:**
  - 85% high school graduation rate
  - 27% post-secondary (2-4 year college) degree attainment
  - $972 billion budget (public and private)
  - 98% literacy rate for students over 15
  - Science and math education ranks at the bottom compared to other developed countries

- **Women in Computer and Information Science:**
  - By 2016, U.S. universities will produce only 53% of the computer science bachelor's degrees needed to fill 1.5 million computer specialist jobs.
  - Only 18% of computer and information science degrees were awarded to women in 2008, down from 37% in 1985.

- **Combining Hackerspaces with Schools:**

  - Hackerspace members use the space from 5pm-11pm on weekdays and 9am-11pm on weekends
  - Mentorship program pairing students with professionals
  - Combining hands-on projects with traditional accredited high school curricula

- **Why Hackerspaces Can Do This Better:**
  - Students learn differently than the 1960s educational model
