On Windows 10, several Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules can be enabled to prevent the execution of potentially malicious executable files. These rules are particularly effective in blocking executables that have been downloaded and executed by Office applications, scripting interpreters, or email clients, as well as those that do not meet specific criteria for prevalence, age, or trusted lists. It is important to note that cloud-delivered protection must be enabled for certain ASR rules to function effectively. [258]
