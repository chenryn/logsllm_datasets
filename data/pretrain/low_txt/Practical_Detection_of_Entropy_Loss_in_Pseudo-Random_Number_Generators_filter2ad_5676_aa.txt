## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to David Pointcheval and Damien Vergnaud for welcoming me to the cryptography laboratory at the Department of Computer Science at ENS and for their excellent supervision of my thesis work. Their availability, scientific rigor, and dedication have greatly contributed to the success of this project. I am deeply grateful for the time they spent patiently answering all my questions, for reading and rereading various versions of this manuscript and my articles, and for helping me with presentation rehearsals.

I also want to thank Eric Dehais for his unwavering support throughout this project and for his commitment to ensuring its successful completion under the best conditions. I appreciate his dedication to investing in knowledge and research.

I am very grateful to all the jury members who honored me by evaluating my work. I am particularly thankful to Emmanuel Prouff and Bart Preneel for their interest in my thesis and for agreeing to be its reviewers. I also thank Pierre-Alain Fouque, Marc Girault, Phillip Rogaway, and Nicolas Sendrier for serving as examiners.

I extend my thanks to all my co-authors, with whom I had enriching collaborations due to their scientific and personal qualities. In addition to Damien and David, I had the opportunity to work with Yevgeniy Dodis during his stay at the laboratory in June 2012 and to co-author my first scientific article with him and Daniel Wichs. Subsequently, I co-authored a second article with Mario Cornejo and a third with Sonia Belaïd and Michel Abdalla. I sincerely hope we will have the chance to work together on new projects.

These years of doctoral studies have been filled with enriching encounters, both at the laboratory, at Oppida, and elsewhere. I would like to thank the researchers and students I met at the laboratory: Adrian, Alain, Angelo, Aurélie, Aurore, Cécile, Céline, Duong-Hieu, Dario, Elisabeth, Fabrice, Geoffroy, Giuseppe, Hoeteck, Houda, Louiza, Itai, Joana, Kenneth, Léo, Mario, Miriam, Pierre-Alain, Pierrick, Rafael, Roch, Sorina, Tancrède, Thomas, and Vadim; Louiza, the future student at Oppida; Marion and Patrick, who invited me to present my work at LORIA and GREYC; and the entire C2 community I met in Dinard and Les Sept Laux.

I also thank ENS for providing such a favorable environment for research and for allowing me to participate in numerous conferences. I take this opportunity to thank the entire staff of the Department of Computer Science, especially Joëlle Isnard, Valérie Mongiat, Michele Angely, and Jacques Beigbeder, for their efficient handling of all administrative and technical matters during my thesis.

I also think of all my friends and family who supported and encouraged me throughout this project. Special thanks to Christophe, Jean-François, Jan, and Aziz for their invaluable encouragement.

Finally, I want to thank the people who mean the most to me: my wife Raja and my two daughters, Mona and Nada. This project would not have been possible without their constant support and infectious joy of life.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Pseudo-Random Number Generators

#### Standard Pseudo-Random Number Generators
In cryptography, randomness plays a crucial role in multiple applications. It is essential for fundamental tasks such as key generation, masking and hiding values, nonce and initialization vector generation. The security of these cryptographic algorithms and protocols relies on a source of unbiased and uniformly distributed random bits. Cryptography practitioners typically use pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) to generate these random bits. PRNGs are deterministic algorithms that produce sequences of numbers that appear random but are actually determined by an initial seed value. The quality and security of the generated random numbers depend heavily on the entropy of the seed and the design of the PRNG.
