## Agenda
1. **Introduction**
   - Who are we?
2. **Evolution of Wi-Fi Attacks**
   - Attack tools
   - Threats
   - Solutions
3. **Beholder Overview**
   - What does Beholder detect?
   - What Beholder doesn't do
4. **Scenarios and Future Directions**
5. **Wi-Fi Attack Types**
   - DoS (Denial of Service)
   - MiTM (Man-in-the-Middle)
   - Impersonation
   - Surveillance
   - Packet Injection
   - Crypto Cracking (WEP, WPA)
   - Client-Side Attacks (AdHocs Circa)
   - Rogue APs
   - Impersonation 2.0 (Evil-twin, More rogue-APs)
   - Drive-By Pharming
   - Faster Crypto-Cracking
   - Rogue RADIUS Servers
6. **Tools and Solutions**
   - Introduction to WIDS (Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems)
   - State of WIDS
   - Free Tools (e.g., Roguescanner)
7. **Beholder Features**
   - No chipset or 802.11 standard limitations (supports 802.11n)
   - Based on beacon frames
8. **What Beholder Detects and Reports**
   - Changes in AP (ESSID, MAC, Mode)
   - Channel changes
   - Huge signal level variations
   - Missing APs
   - And more...
9. **Things We DON'T Do**
   - Sniffing on any interface types
   - Putting 802.11 interfaces in monitor mode
   - WPA/WEP cracking
   - Detecting client or AP authentication failures
10. **Design Challenges**
    - Easy to install and use
    - Comprehensive
    - Scanning time differences per adapter
    - Madwifi “caching” issue
    - Few dependencies
    - Written in a fast language (C ANSI)
11. **Caveats**
    - Current limitations
12. **Future of Beholder**
    - Karma Detection
    - Other potential features
13. **Scenarios**
    - Alerting for missing APs
    - Checking for similar ESSIDs via RegEx
    - Handling huge environments with Syslog server
    - Demo
14. **Conclusion**
    - Even great tools might not help in all situations
    - Beholder can still be a valuable asset
    - What's next in Wi-Fi attacks?
