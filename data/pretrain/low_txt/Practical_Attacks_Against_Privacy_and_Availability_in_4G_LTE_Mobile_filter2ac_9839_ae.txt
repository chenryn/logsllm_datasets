### Flexibility for Security in 5G Architectures

Software-defined networking (SDN) and cloud computing are key concepts in emerging 5G architectures, which necessitate a flexible approach to security. The 3GPP follows the best practice of documenting exceptions when specifications need to deviate from the general security design principles recommended by the security working group (as was the case with L3 or D1/D2/D3). We further recommend that each such exception should trigger an analysis of its implications. For example, if an exception is made to forego integrity protection for a denial message from the network, the standards group should consider the potential consequences and recovery methods if the denial message contains incorrect information.

### Countermeasures and Discussion

We now discuss potential countermeasures against the attacks demonstrated in earlier sections, focusing on protocol-level and operational fixes that can be implemented by baseband vendors and mobile network operators. Some of these countermeasures are more straightforward than others, and some may introduce hidden dependencies, requiring more extensive changes in the networks than initially apparent.

#### Protection Against Location Leaks

LTE broadcast information includes subscriber identities, which enable tracking of User Equipment (UEs) through unprotected messages. Two solutions can help prevent UEs from being tracked:

1. **Public Key Mechanism:**
   - **Solution:** Protect broadcast messages using a public key mechanism.
   - **Implementation:** This requires significant changes in LTE protocols. According to [54], 3GPP decided against this due to high implementation costs. However, recent findings may have shifted this trade-off. A scheme where public/private keys are used only for network elements could now be justified. Network messages could be signed using a public key digital signature mechanism, allowing UEs to verify their authenticity. This would prevent rogue network elements from sending false information, such as false radio link failure messages (L3). Messages to the network could be encrypted using the public key of the serving operator, eliminating the need for UEs to send their identities in the clear during the Attach procedure.
   - **Challenges:** Paging messages are difficult to protect even with public keys for UEs, as UEs would have to decrypt all paging messages. Ensuring global availability and verifiability of public keys for network components (e.g., eNodeB) is also required.

2. **Frequent GUTI Re-allocation:**
   - **Solution:** Network operators frequently re-allocate Globally Unique Temporary Identifiers (GUTIs) to avoid tracking.
   - **Implementation:** One national operator, after acknowledging the feasibility of our attacks, has already configured their networks to prevent tracking based on GUTIs. This solution protects against passive attacks (L1) and provides some protection against semi-passive adversaries by making their actions more visible to subscribers. Tools like Darshak [31] and SnoopSnitch [32] can help visualize suspicious signaling to subscribers, but the challenge lies in making them usable and useful for all types of subscribers.

#### Protection Against Denial of Service (DoS)

The specification vulnerabilities responsible for DoS attacks based on the Tracking Area Update (TAU) procedure (D1 and D2) can be addressed without changing the protocol itself. The 3GPP SA3 group may propose a new mechanism based on a counter or timer value to recover from DoS attacks. If a UE is detached from the network for a certain duration due to TAU reject messages, it should reset the configuration settings in the USIM or baseband to re-attach itself without user intervention. If there is infrastructure to support the distribution of operator public keys, TAU reject messages could be signed by the network and verified by UEs.

For DoS attacks stemming from bidding down (D3), the UE's network and security capabilities are sent to the network during the Attach procedure. An attacker can modify this list to downgrade the capabilities reported by the UE. Both 3G and LTE contain a partial 'matching history' mechanism to allow the UE to check that its original list of security capabilities matches those received by the network. Similar protection for network capabilities is needed due to the persistent nature of the DoS attack. This would require changes in LTE protocols. Using operator public keys, digital signatures can protect lists of capabilities broadcast by the network. Alternatively, the negotiation of network capabilities could be done after Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) is successfully completed.

### Related Work

In this section, we describe related work in GSM, 3G, and LTE air-interface security. Previous works have reported attacks against 2G and 3G access network protocols [2], [55], core network protocols [56], [57], [58], [59], and services [60]. In passive attacks, Kune et al. [2] showed that despite the use of temporary IDs, the location of a subscriber's UE in a GSM network can be leaked. However, the granularity of their location leaks is lower compared to our attacks on LTE networks. The 3GPP discusses threats exposed in E-UTRAN [51] during LTE security studies, but the attacks we presented were not identified in these studies.

In active attacks, the authors in [61] present a method to determine the presence of a subscriber in a particular area by exploiting a vulnerability in the 3G AKA protocol. By leveraging a rogue eNodeB (femtocell), previously captured authentication parameters are replayed to the UE, confirming the presence based on the response from the phone. However, their attack cannot reveal the approximate location of the UE in a given area.

In DoS attacks, the authors in [44] describe unauthenticated attach requests sent from a compromised UE/eNodeB to flood the MME and HSS, leading to a DoS attack. However, their DoS attacks target the network, not LTE subscribers. Through simulations, the authors in [62] show that Botnets can cause DoS attacks by exhausting subscriber traffic capacity over the air interface. A proof-of-concept paper by P. Jover et al. [63] provides an overview of new effective attacks (smart jamming) that extend the range and effectiveness of basic radio jamming. However, according to [54], both flooding and jamming attacks are non-persistent and not considered major threats in LTE architecture. In contrast, our DoS attacks are persistent and targeted towards UEs (subscribers).

LTE security architecture and a detailed list of security vulnerabilities existing in LTE networks have been presented in [64]. Our attacks are not covered in this survey. Two recent papers [65], [66] discuss resource stealing and DoS attacks against VoLTE, whereas our focus is on LTE access network protocols. To the best of our knowledge, there was no previous work evaluating practical attacks on LTE access networks in the literature.

### Conclusion

We have demonstrated that the vulnerabilities discovered in LTE access network protocols lead to new privacy and availability threats to LTE subscribers. Our attacks can be mounted using open-source LTE software stacks and readily available hardware at low cost. The need for balancing security with other requirements (availability, performance, and functionality) led to these vulnerabilities. Such trade-offs are essential for the success of any large-scale system, but the equilibrium points are not static. We recommend that future standardization efforts take this into account.

**Impact:**
- We followed standard responsible disclosure practices with all affected manufacturers and notified affected operators and the 3GPP. All four manufacturers acknowledged our report, and two have released patches [67], [68]. Two of three operators have fixed the configuration issues in their networks. The 3GPP has initiated several updates to the LTE specifications to address the issues we raised [69]. Up-to-date information about the impact can be found in the arXiv report version of this paper [6] and on our project website.
