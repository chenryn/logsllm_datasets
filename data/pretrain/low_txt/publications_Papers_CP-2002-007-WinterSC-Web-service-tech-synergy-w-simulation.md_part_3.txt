### Currently, the World Wide Web is Mainly a Collection of Documents

The World Wide Web (WWW) is primarily a collection of documents that can be searched via keywords. Efforts are currently underway to transform it into a more effective and meaningful platform. These efforts include the Semantic Web and Web Services.

#### The Semantic Web
The goal of the Semantic Web is to enable users to find more relevant information and less irrelevant content. In other words, search results will be better targeted. This is achieved by making web documents more meaningful and adding functional capabilities. 

#### Web Services
Simultaneously, web services are being developed to provide standardized and interoperable services on a global scale. This has been done in a proprietary manner for some time (e.g., ordering a book from Amazon.com). However, for the first time in the history of computing, infrastructure is being developed to provide these services in a standardized and interoperable fashion.

### Components and Tools

- **Visualization Tools, OLAP Tools, and Data Mining Tools**: These tools can be decoupled from simulations and simply access an information resource, making them well-suited for becoming web services.
- **Scenario Managers, Optimizers, and Animators**: These components are more tightly coupled with simulations but can still be separated enough to form cooperative web services. For example, an animator may be either tightly-coupled (with access to the simulation state) or loosely-coupled (with access to a trace stored in a database).

### JSIM Model for the Book Purchasing Web Process

JSIM (Java-based Simulation and Modeling) is a simulation environment that uses Java Beans technology to link simulation models and XML-based messaging for interoperability. It is currently being converted to use web service technology, allowing simulation data to be stored and retrieved in databases using web services.

### Evolution of JSIM

Over the past decade, researchers have explored the use of component-based software to develop modular simulation environments. These environments allow developers to treat simulation models and other data resources as components that can be assembled to create more elaborate simulation models.

#### Key Features of JSIM
- **Java Beans Technology**: Used to link simulation models.
- **XML-Based Messaging**: Addresses interoperability issues.
- **Agent-Based Environment**: Some researchers have used this approach to link simulation models, data resources, and other components.

### Model Federates as Web Services

The final step in utilizing web service technology would be to code model federates as web services. If the interaction rate between federates is not too high, the disadvantage of increased overhead may be outweighed by the interoperability benefits. In cases where causality enforcement is not important, this change would be straightforward. If causality is to be enforced, new infrastructure needs to be developed.

### Future Work

- **Web Service Composition**: Efforts are being made to provide composite web services with transactional capabilities.
- **Semantic Descriptions**: Descriptions in the form of WSDL, WFSL, DAML-S, or newer description/information modeling schemes will be used. Ontologies will provide a semantic basis for the terms used in these descriptions, enhancing the precision in finding the appropriate web service.
