### Multiple Level Authentication Scheme (MLAS) for Vehicular Networks

#### 1. Introduction
In this section, we present a multiple level authentication scheme (MLAS) designed to enhance the security and efficiency of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The proposed scheme leverages tamper-proof devices but removes the strong assumption that a long-term system master secret must be preloaded into all devices. Instead, the system master secret can be securely transmitted and updated as needed.

#### 2. Message Verification and Delay Analysis
- **Notation:**
  - \( M \): Number of messages received by vehicle \( V_i \).
  - \( T_{m}^{\text{verf}} \): Time at which vehicle \( V_i \) finishes verifying the signature (for MLAS) or receives the verification notification message from the RSU (for SPECS, RAISE, and IBV).
  - \( T_{m}^{\text{recv}} \): Time at which vehicle \( i \) receives message \( m \) from its neighboring vehicle.

- **Delay Comparison:**
  - From Figure 2, the delay under SPECS, RAISE, and IBV protocols is very close.
  - For MLAS, the delay is the lowest among the four, with a savings of 0.09 seconds. This is because vehicles do not need to wait for RSU's verification results and can perform simple HMAC verification on their own.

#### 3. Impact of Urgent Messages
- **Experiment Setup:**
  - Fixed number of vehicles entering the RSU's range: 600.
  - Varying proportion of urgent messages from 0% to 100% in steps of 20%.

- **Success Rate:**
  - For SPECS, RAISE, and IBV, the average success rate remains around 99.85%, regardless of the number of urgent messages.
  - For MLAS, the average success rate is higher than other schemes as long as the proportion of urgent messages is less than 100%. This is due to the fact that vehicle-based verification is not affected by RSU range limitations.

- **Delay Performance:**
  - The average delay under SPECS, RAISE, and IBV is similar.
  - With MLAS, the verification delay is significantly lower, especially when there are no urgent messages (only 1 ms required for verification).
  - When there are no urgent messages, the verification delay for MLAS is 110 times smaller than for other protocols (0.11 s vs. 1 ms).

#### 4. Batch Verification Analysis
- **Implementation Results:**
  - Pairing time is not constant, as assumed by SPECS and IBV.
  - Using PBC [25] and GMP [26] libraries, the verification time increases from 0.0279 s to 11.839 s as the number of signatures increases from 1 to 50.
  - Replacing batch verification with multiple single verifications, the verification time increases from 0.0279 s to 1.396 s. Thus, batch verification is 8.5 times slower than multiple single verifications.

- **No Batch Verification (NBV) Experiments:**
  - **First Set (Revised):** MLAS outperforms SPECS in terms of average success rate and delay, with a larger gap than before. For SPECS, the average success rate drops from 99.83% to 99.68% without batch verification.
  - **Second Set (Revised):** MLAS outperforms SPECS in terms of average success rate and delay. When there are no urgent messages, the gain in success rate increases from 0.1443% to 0.2323%, and the saving in average delay increases from 0.108 s to 0.173 s (108 times to 173 times smaller).

#### 5. Conclusions
- **Summary:**
  - MLAS is more efficient than RSU-aided authentication schemes, especially when regular messages exist in the system.
  - The saving in verification delay can be up to 0.11 s (110 times smaller) and up to 0.173 s (173 times smaller) without batch verification.
  - Our implementation shows that batch verification may not be as efficient as expected.

- **Future Work:**
  - Extending the scheme to group communications scenarios.
  - Considering other secure applications in VANETs.
