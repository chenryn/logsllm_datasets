### Results and Analysis

The results indicate that the behavioral HMM models outperform the Naïve Bayes model, regardless of the length of local contexts considered. This suggests that contextual information is a crucial feature for category prediction. The findings also imply that longer context lengths may lead to better category predictions. If more computational resources are available, longer contexts can be explored. Among all the models, the 4-gram HMM model performs the best, achieving an accuracy of 0.463 in predicting fine-grained categories of a user's next access.

| Model            | Accuracy |

| - 2-gram         | 0.4596   |

### Blocking Trend Analysis

In the second set of experiments, we further investigate the blocking trend using our proposed 4-gram HMM model over time. The test set is divided into several subsets for real-life filtering simulations, with each subset representing a one-day time period. If the predicted result belongs to one of the five security-related categories—Spyware, Phishing, Botnet, Virus/Worm, or Hacking—the test instance is classified as a "Security Threat" and its corresponding URL is added to the blacklist. Users' accesses will be blocked if their URLs are included in the generated blacklist.

From a filtering perspective, incorrect blocking can cause unfair penalties. Therefore, in addition to achieving a high blocking rate (the proportion of dangerous accesses correctly blocked), it is also important to reduce the over-blocking rate (the ratio of normal accesses incorrectly predicted as dangerous). 

Empirical results show that our approach achieves a macro-averaging blocking rate of 0.4293, effectively detecting security threats that the original filtering engine cannot filter at the time of user access. We also analyze the shortened time intervals of dangerous accesses that can be correctly blocked by our browsing-behavior-based method in real-life simulations. In this experiment, our proposed approach can provide an average advance warning of 8.4 hours, efficiently alerting users to avoid security threats and reducing human costs. This demonstrates that our 4-gram HMM model is cost-effective for blocking unknown security threats at an early stage.

Additionally, our approach achieves a low macro-averaging over-blocking rate of 0.0005, indicating that our method is reliable for real-time filtering by exploring users' browsing behaviors alone.

### Damage Distribution Analysis

A dangerous page may be accessed multiple times, causing propagated damages due to its popularity. We plot the damage distributions across countries where threat-affected victims are located to observe threat diffusions. Figures 1 and 2 show the victims' country distributions without and with our early warning mechanism, respectively. Significant areas in red represent more located victims. Comparing these two figures, it is evident that our approach can effectively prevent severe diffusions of security threats. For example, there were 28 victims in the USA who fell into dangerous situations caused by undetected security threats. With our early warning mechanism, 67.86% of users avoided these threats, leaving only 9 remaining victims in the USA.

### Discussion

Previous approaches focus on anomalous patterns from attackers' perspectives, which are challenging to detect new or unknown attack patterns. In contrast, our approach studies the context in which users fall into dangerous states from the users' perspective. Collective intelligence is derived from a large scale of users' click-through data to prevent web security threats at an early stage, thereby avoiding the unlimited propagation of damages. Contextual information is a key factor in security threat prevention. Our analysis of the data sets indicates that many users visiting web pages categorized as "Pornography" or "Software Download" often encounter dangerous states. This suggests that avoiding such sites or being more cautious during browsing can enhance web security.

Our proposed model is a lightweight process that leverages collective intelligence embedded in browsing behaviors to alert users of potential security threats at an early stage. In practice, our behavioral HMM complements existing content-based dynamic rating systems, enabling the rapid blocking of unknown security threats during web surfing.

### Conclusions and Future Work

This paper presents an effective web security threat prevention method based on users' browsing behaviors rather than attackers' patterns. The experiments show that incorporating more contextual information leads to better category prediction. Although including additional information, such as attack trails, may further improve accuracy, the use of browsing behaviors alone makes this approach competitive. Future work could explore the integration of other types of information to further enhance the model's performance.
