### Title: Detecting Domain Abuse for Phishing Using DNS

The Dutch Tax and Customs Administration, as a high-profile public-sector organization, frequently encounters criminals impersonating its representatives to send phishing emails. To combat this, we have developed a technique using DNS logging and standards like RFC7208 â€“ Sender Policy Framework (SPF) to identify and mitigate such phishing attacks. This method is universally applicable and can provide valuable insights into the origins and targets of phishing emails.

In this presentation, we will first outline the available standards and protocols that enhance email security. We will briefly discuss:

- **STARTTLS**: Ensures secure communication between mail servers.
- **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**: Authorizes which mail servers are permitted to send emails on behalf of a domain.
- **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**: Adds a digital signature to emails to verify their authenticity.
- **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)**: Builds on SPF and DKIM to provide reporting and policy enforcement.
- **DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities)**: Uses DNSSEC to secure TLS connections.
- **MTA-STS (Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security)**: Enforces secure email transmission.

We will also delve into advanced SPF options to further refine our approach. By integrating these protocols, we can effectively detect if our domains are being misused for phishing attacks. The framework we have developed provides comprehensive insights into phishing activities conducted under the guise of our organization's name.

We firmly believe that widespread adoption of these techniques would significantly reduce the prevalence of phishing emails.
