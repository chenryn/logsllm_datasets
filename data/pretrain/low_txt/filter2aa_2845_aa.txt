## Cyber Attacks are Everywhere
- The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks highlight the need for robust detection mechanisms.

## Captured Zero-Day Attacks
- **CVE-2018-15982**: An international cyber-attack on a government agency using a new Flash zero-day.
- **CVE-2018-8174**: A new APT MS Office attack using a browser zero-day, affecting the latest version of Internet Explorer and applications using the IE core.
- **CVE-2018-5002**: A globally detected Flash zero-day affecting Adobe Flash Player 29.0.0.171 and all earlier versions.
- **CVE-2018-0802**: The first in-the-wild zero-day Microsoft fixed in 2018, known as Nightmare Equation II.
- **CVE-2017-11826**: An exclusive and global capture of an in-the-wild Office zero-day, marking the first such attack caught by a Chinese security vendor.

## Statistics on Detected N-Day Exploits (March 2018 - March 2019)
- **File Types**: doc, docm, docx, eml, html, hwp, msi, nsis, pdf, ppt, pptm, pptx, rtf, swf, vbs, xls, xlsm, xlsx, exe, dll, others
- **Vulnerability Modules**: Flash, HWP, IE, Kernel, Office, PDF
- **Partial Vulnerability Count**: CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2015-1641, CVE-2015-1726, CVE-2015-2545, CVE-2016-7255, CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2017-8570, CVE-2018-0798, CVE-2018-0802, CVE-2018-4878

## Advanced Threat Automation
- **Large-scale Sample Cloud**
- **Static Anti-virus Engine (AVE QEX QVM)**
- **Sample Pre-filtering Strategy**
- **Sandbox Servers Cluster**
- **Virtual Machine Isolation Environments**
- **Sandbox Detection Engine**
- **Rule Scoring System**
- **Result Alarm and Response**

## How It Works: Sandbox Detection Engine
- **Initial Scenario: Dynamic Library**
  - Injected into target processes to work
  - Hooks export functions of system libraries
  - Lightweight but easily detectable and bypassable
  - Can lose tracking of new processes launched remotely

- **The 2nd Option: Driver**
  - Monitors system calls from the target in the kernel
  - Uses system callbacks, notifications, and filters
  - Provides more complete monitoring coverage and comprehensive tracking
  - Challenges: PATCH GUARD for 64-bit OS

### Diagrams and Flow
- **Userland and Kernel Interaction**
  - Userland: lib, syscall, obj, proc, fsflt, drv
  - Kernel: Sandbox Detector Driver, lib

This document provides an overview of the challenges and solutions in detecting zero-day vulnerabilities using sandbox environments.
