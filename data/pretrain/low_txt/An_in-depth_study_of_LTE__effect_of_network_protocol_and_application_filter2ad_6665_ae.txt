### Bandwidth Utilization in Large Flows

- **Utilization Ratios**: 71.3% of large flows have bandwidth utilization ratios below 50%. For 6.4% of the flows, the used bandwidth slightly exceeds the estimated bandwidth, likely due to estimation errors.
- **Average Utilization**: The average bandwidth utilization ratio is 34.6%.
- **Impact of Low Utilization**: Lower bandwidth utilization requires more time to transfer the same amount of data, leading to increased radio energy overhead and higher radio resource consumption [13].

### Variability in Available Bandwidth

- **Observations from LTE Data Set**: Figure 22 illustrates two sample large TCP flows and their estimated bandwidth. These flows belong to different users at different times, with the time aligned for presentation purposes.
- **Bandwidth Variability**: The available bandwidth varies significantly over time, even on a second-by-second scale. This variability can be attributed to changes in network conditions (e.g., signal strength) or network load at the associated eNB.
- **Further Analysis**: To understand the root cause of this variability, additional information such as the load on the eNB is needed.

### Performance of TCP under Variable Bandwidth

- **Experimental Setup**: To study TCP performance under highly variable available bandwidth, we use `iptables` to redirect packets to a custom packet scheduler. This scheduler mimics the bandwidth variations observed in LTE networks and injects varying delays to simulate RTT.
- **Results**:
  - **Small RTTs**: Under small RTTs, TCP can utilize over 95% of the available bandwidth.
  - **Large RTTs**: When RTT exceeds 400ms, the utilization ratio drops below 50%.
  - **Bandwidth Variation**: Higher bandwidth variation leads to lower utilization, especially for the same RTT.
- **Implications**: Large RTTs can degrade TCP performance in LTE networks, which inherently have varying available bandwidth due to changes in load and channel conditions.

### Network Applications in LTE

#### 7.1 HTTP Content Characterization

- **Protocol Usage**: HTTP dominates the application-layer protocol usage on mobile devices [34].
- **Content Breakdown**:
  - **Video**: 37.8%
  - **Images**: 19.5%
  - **Text**: 11.8%
  - **Zip Files**: 8.3% (primarily file downloads like app updates)
  - **Audio**: 6.5%
  - **Other**: 5.6%
  - **Unknown**: 10.5%
- **Multimedia Traffic**: Video and audio content dominate, followed by images. This is consistent with previous studies [19, 7], though the percentage of multimedia traffic in LTE is slightly higher.

#### 7.2 Inefficient Network Usage

- **TCP Receive Window Bottleneck**: We investigate large flows with under-utilized bandwidth and find that the TCP receive window size [32] often becomes a bottleneck.
- **Example: Shazam App** (Figure 23):
  - **Initial High Throughput**: Between 0s and 2s, the downlink throughput is over 3Mbps.
  - **Subsequent Drop**: Between 2s and 9s, the throughput drops to less than 300Kbps.
  - **Total Download Time**: 9 seconds, but could have been completed in 2.5s based on available bandwidth.
  - **Connection Closure**: The TCP connection remains open until 30s, despite the HTTP request specifying "Connection: close."
  - **Radio Interface On-Time**: The total download process keeps the radio interface active for 38 seconds, compared to an ideal 12.5 seconds.
- **Reasons for Full TCP Receive Window**:
  - **Initial Size**: The initial receive window size is small (e.g., 131.8KB in the Shazam example).
  - **Application Behavior**: The application does not read data fast enough from the TCP receiving buffer.
- **Prevalence**: 52.6% of downlink TCP flows experience a full receive window, with 91.2% of these occurring in the first 10% of the flow duration.

#### 7.3 Periodic Network Activities

- **Example: Netflix App** (Figure 24):
  - **HTTP Requests**: The app sends periodic byte-range requests for video chunks every 10 seconds.
  - **Throughput Pattern**: The aggregated downlink throughput shows a clear periodic pattern, with peak throughput reaching up to 30Mbps but mostly idle.
  - **Energy Impact**: This periodic behavior keeps the UE radio interface in a high-power state, leading to unnecessary energy overheads.

### Discussion

- **Optimizing Multimedia Traffic**: Given the dominance of multimedia traffic in LTE networks, optimizing network utilization for popular apps is crucial for better user experiences and battery life.
- **Solutions**:
  - **Dynamic Receive Window Adjustment (DRWA)**: Proposals to address the receive window problem [16], though deployment may be challenging.
  - **Application Design**: Apps should read downloaded data quickly from the TCP receiver buffer and close connections promptly.
  - **Batch Transfers**: Sending fewer requests and downloading more content per request can reduce radio energy and improve TCP performance [13].

### Conclusion

- **Key Findings**:
  - **TCP Behaviors**: Certain TCP behaviors, such as not updating RTT estimates, can cause severe performance issues in LTE networks.
  - **Bandwidth Utilization**: 71.3% of large flows have utilization ratios below 50%, and available bandwidth in LTE networks is highly variable.
  - **Receive Window Bottleneck**: 52.6% of downlink flows are throttled by the TCP receive window.
  - **Application Design**: Poorly designed apps can lead to under-utilized bandwidth.
- **Future Work**: These insights can guide the development of more efficient transport protocols and applications for LTE networks.
