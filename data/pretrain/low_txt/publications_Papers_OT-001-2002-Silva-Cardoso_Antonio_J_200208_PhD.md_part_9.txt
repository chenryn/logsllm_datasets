#### Systems and Organizations: Describing Non-Functional Aspects of Workflows
The model is predictive, enabling the automatic computation of the Quality of Service (QoS) for workflows (networks) based on the QoS of individual workflow components (tasks). This feature is particularly important for large processes, which may contain hundreds of tasks. We present a mathematical model that formally describes the formulae to compute QoS metrics among workflow tasks. Based on these formulae, we have developed an algorithm (SWR algorithm) to automatically compute the overall QoS of a workflow. The algorithm applies a set of reduction rules to a workflow until only one task remains, representing the QoS for the entire workflow. Additionally, we describe how a simulation system can be used with a workflow system to carry out efficient workflow QoS simulations.

#### Validation of the QoS Model
To test the validity of our QoS model and the mathematical model, we deployed a set of production workflows in the field of genetics at the Fungal Genome Resource laboratory. We executed several workflow instances and collected and analyzed the generated QoS data. The analysis corroborates our initial hypothesis, which states that our QoS model and mathematical model provide a suitable framework for predicting and analyzing the QoS of production workflows.

### Chapter 3: Implementing Quality of Service for Workflow Management Systems
**Abstract**
Workflow management systems (WfMSs) are widely used to support various types of business processes. As organizations adopt new working models, such as e-commerce, new challenges arise, including the need for effective quality of service (QoS) management. QoS management involves specifying, computing, monitoring, and controlling the quality of the products or services delivered. Effective QoS management is crucial for the success of e-commerce activities by better fulfilling customer expectations and achieving satisfaction. In this paper, we present an implementation of a comprehensive QoS model for workflows, specifically for the METEOR workflow system. The ideas presented here can also be applied to other workflow systems. We describe the components that have been changed or added and discuss how they interact to enable the specification, computation, and monitoring of QoS.

**Introduction**
Organizations continuously seek innovative information systems to better fulfill their missions and strategic goals. Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs) help streamline and automate business processes, reengineer organizational structures, and increase efficiency while reducing costs. Workflow systems are also valuable for managing e-commerce applications that span multiple organizations. As the number of online services increases, workflow systems are essential for coordinating and managing the interaction among Web services.

In modern markets, such as e-commerce, systematic design, planning, control, and management of business processes are critical. One key aspect is the quality of service (QoS) management. Products and services must meet well-defined specifications, especially since customers do not have tangible access to the products when trading online. Effective QoS management leads to the creation of high-quality products and services, which in turn fulfill customer expectations and achieve customer satisfaction.
