### 3.4 Discussion

M2D2 offers a powerful and expressive tool for developing complex correlation methods. For instance, the reduction of false positives, as described in Section 3.3, would have been challenging to achieve without such a rich and formal model. The three aggregation methods presented above demonstrate the ease and effectiveness of composing relations. These aggregations can be further combined to create more sophisticated relationships. For example, the first two aggregations can be composed to form a new, relevant aggregation relation (harmful−1; common target). Applying harmful−1 to a given host provides alerts related to potentially successful attacks. When this is combined with the common target function, it becomes possible to identify which attacks might be effective on a specific host.

The formal specification also aids in detecting various issues. For example, the sub-config relation in Figure 11 was introduced to ensure type consistency between composed relations. This has practical implications for implementation: either an intermediate table must be created, or the sub-configuration needs to be checked at correlation time.

### 4 Related Work

#### Formal Models
As mentioned in the introduction, the most closely related work includes the NetStat Network Fact Base (NNFB) by Vigna and Kemmerer [4,5] and the Intrusion Reference Model (IRM) by Goldman et al. [6]. Both NNFB and the Network Entity Relationship Database (NERD) in IRM are based on Vigna’s network formal model [7], as are the topology and network events in M2D2. The concept of "product" in M2D2 is similar to the "services" concept in NNFB and NERD. While security tools are mentioned in both NNFB and IRM, they are not precisely specified. To our knowledge, no existing model includes the vulnerability and alert components of M2D2. On the other hand, IRM includes a security goals database, which captures security policies set by administrators and aggregates evidence of policy violations. This feature, though not yet formalized, could be added to M2D2 in the future. As noted in Section 2.5, M2D2 does not currently model system-level events, but we are working on incorporating these.

Another related effort is the IETF Intrusion Detection Working Group (IDWG) [12], which proposed the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF) to provide a common format for alerts [12]. The alert specification in M2D2 is compatible with IDMEF, allowing IDMEF-compliant alerts to be received and processed within the M2D2 framework without losing semantic information. M2D2's scope is broader than IDMEF, encompassing all relevant information sources for information security. It simplifies the IDMEF model by removing classes with similar semantic content and conveying the same information through aggregation relationships. This is particularly evident in the replacement of the source and target classes with the notion of a node, while the source and target information are carried by aggregation relationships.

#### Implicit Models for Correlation
Another aspect of related work is correlation. Researchers in the field have developed implicit models dedicated to their correlation algorithms. M2D2 aims to provide a solid modeling foundation that allows multiple correlation tools and algorithms to be implemented and tested.

Cuppens and Miège [15,16] base their fusion work on the IDMEF data model [12], implemented as Prolog predicates. Their model is simpler than M2D2, meaning less information is available for correlation. Relying solely on intrusion-detection alerts makes it impossible to assess the relevance of these alerts concerning the monitored information system.

Cuppens and Miège [16] suggest using attack scenarios specified in the Lambda language [17] for correlating alerts. Such a language allows correlations between events belonging to the same attack scenario and could be used in conjunction with M2D2.

The Tivoli RiskManager tool [13] is a correlation platform for security events provided by information systems. Initially developed for correlating intrusion-detection alerts, it now also correlates information from firewalls and antivirus systems. The data model used by Tivoli RiskManager was the basis for the first version of IDMEF, but IDMEF has evolved, and the constraints of the Tivoli environment make it difficult to implement the exact IDMEF model. Events from the three information sources (intrusion-detection systems, firewalls, and antivirus systems) are not related in Tivoli RiskManager, so the correlation algorithm must develop hypotheses about the relationships between events based on superficial characteristics.

### 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced M2D2, a formal information model designed for security information representation and correlation. The model includes four types of information crucial for rich alert correlations: information system characteristics, vulnerabilities, security tools, and events and alerts. M2D2 addresses three key issues in intrusion detection today: the large number of alerts, the quality of these alerts, and the precision of the final diagnosis provided to operators.

M2D2 reuses and integrates multiple relevant concepts into a unified framework, extending them as needed to encompass the four types of useful information. Additionally, M2D2 is formally defined, following McHugh's suggestion that significant progress in intrusion detection will depend on the development of an underlying theoretical basis. This formalism ensures that the processing of security information, especially alert correlation, is grounded in a rigorous model representing the information being processed. The formalism is extensible, allowing for the incorporation of additional information sources and components.

To illustrate the use of M2D2, we presented three examples of correlation (actually, aggregation) methods. These examples are rigorously specified using the formal definition of M2D2. Unlike previously published correlation methods, these examples utilize more than just the events generated by security tools; they leverage many concepts formalized in M2D2.
