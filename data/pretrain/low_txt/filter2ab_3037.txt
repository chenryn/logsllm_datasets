For Outlook, simply blocking macros may not be effective because the Visual Basic engine used for these features is separate from the macro scripting engine. [1] Microsoft has released several patches to address these issues. Ensure that the following updates are applied to your systems:

- **KB3191938**: This update blocks Outlook Visual Basic and displays a warning for malicious code.
- **KB4011091**: This update disables custom forms by default.
- **KB4011162**: This update removes the legacy Home Page feature.

Applying these patches will help mitigate potential security risks associated with Outlook.
