### Participant Recruitment and Compensation

For this study, we recruited 20 participants: 10 men with an average age of 23 and 10 women with an average age of 24. All participants were students at the Rochester Institute of Technology, comprising 7 undergraduates and 13 graduate students. Each participant received a $10 Amazon.com gift card as compensation upon completion of the session.

### Findings

In this section, we present the results from our study. Given the small sample size, no significance tests were conducted.

#### Relationship with Post-Author
Our results indicate that the likelihood of clicking on a post increases with the closeness of the relationship between the user and the post-author. As shown in Figure 1a, posts shared by Spouse/Partner scored an average of 5.3 (on a 7-point Likert scale), while posts shared by Public Pages scored an average of 4.2. Since all relationship types had similar posting frequencies (ranging from "at least once a day" to "at least once a week"), our findings suggest that the closeness of the relationship with the post-author significantly influences users' clicking decisions.

#### Place of Posting
The location where a post is shared also affects the likelihood of user interaction. Posts shared in more noticeable locations (e.g., the user’s wall, the author’s wall with the user tagged, and the user’s inbox) are more likely to be clicked. As illustrated in Figure 1b, posts shared on the author’s wall (with tagging) scored an average of 5.1, posts shared on the user’s wall and in the messenger (i.e., inbox) scored an average of 4.7, while posts shared on the author’s wall (without tagging) scored the lowest at 3.8. This finding contrasts slightly with our previous work [12], where no significant differences were observed. However, the new results are more intuitive, as posts in more noticeable locations often trigger notifications, alerting users to their presence. Additionally, when authors post on a user’s wall, tag her in a post, or send her a private message, they directly invite her to interact, thereby increasing the likelihood of clicks.

#### Type of Post
The type of post also plays a crucial role. Sales-oriented posts scored the lowest with an average of 3.5, compared to interactive posts (4.5) and media posts (6.7). In our previous work [12], we used different categories (travel, news, and entertainment) which did not yield significant differences. The new categories in this study provide better distinctions.

### Survey Results
We asked participants to report how likely it is for individuals in different relationships to share each type of post in real life. We then measured the likelihood of participants clicking on posts that are similar to (or different from) the types of posts the author is more likely to share. A positive correlation was found between the likelihood of a post-author sharing a particular type of post and the likelihood of the user clicking on such a post (see Figure 2). For example, if a participant reports that her spouse is more likely to share media posts, she is more likely to click on a media post than a sales-oriented or interactive post shared by her spouse. Similarly, participants are more likely to click on posts that align with their expectations of what a public page would share (e.g., a sales-oriented page sharing a sales-related post) compared to unexpected posts, like a media page sharing a sales-related post.

A weak negative correlation was observed between the likelihood of clicking on a post and the difference in post type from what is typically shared by the post-author (see Figure 2). This indicates that users are less likely to interact with posts that deviate from their expectations, although this mismatch does not strongly deter them.

### Conclusions
This vignette study explores the relationship between users' clicking behavior on social media posts and the attributes of the posts, including the post-author, the location of the post, and the type of post. Understanding these factors is crucial for designing mechanisms to protect users from phishing attacks, as attackers often leverage such information to craft their strategies.
