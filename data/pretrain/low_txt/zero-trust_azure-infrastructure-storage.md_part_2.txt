# Configuring Access Control and Network Security for Azure Storage

## Step 1: Configure Access Control
You can configure access control from the **Access Control (IAM)** settings of a storage account. This allows you to check the access levels of users, groups, service principals, or managed identities and add role assignments.

### Best Practices for Using Shared Access Signatures (SAS)
Another method to provide time-bound permissions is through Shared Access Signatures (SAS). Here are some best practices:
- **Always use HTTPS**: If you have deployed the suggested Azure Policies for Azure landing zones, secure transfer via HTTPS will be audited.
- **Have a revocation plan**.
- **Configure SAS expiration policies**.
- **Validate permissions**.
- **Use a user delegation SAS wherever possible**: This SAS is signed with Microsoft Entra credentials.

## Step 2: Logically Separate or Segregate Critical Data with Network Controls
In this step, you use the recommended controls to protect the network connections to and from Azure Storage services.

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Prevent public access, create network segmentation with Private Endpoint and Private Link** | A private endpoint allows you to connect to services using a single private IP address on the VNet via Azure Private Link. This enables the Azure platform to validate network connections and allow only those with explicit access to the private-link resource. You need a separate private endpoint for each service on the Azure Storage Account. |
| **Use Azure Private Link** | Use Azure Private Link to access Azure Storage over a private endpoint in your VNet. Use the approval workflow to automatically approve or manually request, as appropriate. |
| **Prevent public access to your data sources using Service Endpoints** | Network segmentation can be achieved using Service Endpoints by enabling private IP addresses in a VNet to reach an endpoint without using public IP addresses. |

## Step 3: Use Defender for Storage for Automated Threat Detection and Protection
[Microsoft Defender for Storage](/azure/storage/common/azure-defender-storage-configure?tabs=azure-security-center) provides an additional layer of intelligence to detect unusual and potentially harmful attempts to exploit your storage services. It is built into Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

Defender for Storage detects anomalous access patterns such as:
- Access from unusual locations
- Application anomalies
- Anonymous access
- Anomalous extract/upload alerts
- Data exfiltration
- Unexpected deletions
- Upload of Azure Cloud Service packages
- Suspicious storage activities
- Access permission changes
- Access inspections
- Data exploration

For more information about threat protection across the reference architecture, see [Apply Zero Trust principles to Azure IaaS overview](azure-infrastructure-overview.md).

Once enabled, Defender for Storage notifies you of security alerts and recommendations for improving the security posture of your Azure storage accounts.
