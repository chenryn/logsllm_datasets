# Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and System Component Contributions

## Figure 3: Partners and System Component Contributions
- **VNF Manager(s)**: Vi-Vnfm, Nf-Vi
- **Virtualized Infrastructure Manager(s)**: Or-Vi, VIM
- **NFVI Components**: Servers + NICs, Hypervisor, Switches
- **Reference Points**: Execution reference points, Other reference points, Main NFV reference points

## Optimal NFV Deployment
The secondary deployment utilizes the correct NFV TOSCA and VNFD Models. The information in these models allows the Planet Blue orchestrator to optimally deploy the Brocade configuration through the Telefónica VIM, achieving full line rate performance of 23 Mpps (40 Gbps at 192 Bytes). This is illustrated in Figure 5.

### Benefits of Intelligent NFV Deployment
This deployment scenario demonstrates the advantages of an "intelligent" NFV deployment using an EPA-aware delivery stack on the underlying NFVI. The correct extended information model contains the attributes required for deterministic VNF performance. The Brocade vRouter is deployed with the correct EPA parameters exposed via the VNF Descriptor and enforced by the Cyan NFVO and the VIM. The Brocade vRouter achieves high performance by correctly implementing PCIe pass-through, NUMA awareness, CPU pinning, and huge page requirements as specified by the Brocade VNF.

Figure 6 shows similar line rate performance but for larger packet sizes.

## Cloud Computing vs. NFV
### Cloud Computing View
- **Resources**: Memory, CPU (multiple cores), I/O Devices
- **Virtual Machines**: VM1, VM2
- **Bottlenecks**: OS, Hypervisor, vSwitch
- **Hardware**: Physical resources

### NFV View
- **Traffic Management**: Upstream and Downstream traffic
- **Resource Optimization**: Minimize QPI usage, maximize cache sharing, minimize memory translations, use polling mode drivers, and fully assign processes
- **Virtual Machines**: VM1, VM2
- **Data Plane Management**: Direct management, bypassing the hypervisor

## Performance Comparison

- **Throughput (Gbps)**: 40 Gbps (NFV) vs. 0.2 Gbps (Cloud)

## Testimonials
### Telefónica
“Telefónica’s vision for virtualized networks is an end-to-end (E2E) approach, from customer premises to the inner network infrastructure, to improve capacity and flexibility and achieve better TCO. The Telefónica NFV Reference Lab aims to help partners and network equipment vendors test and develop virtualized network functions using an advanced NFV orchestration framework and proper capabilities for deterministic resource allocation. The lab promotes interoperability and provides a more open ecosystem, enabling telecommunications providers to adapt and expand their network services more easily.”
- **Enrique Algaba, Network Innovation and Virtualisation Director, Telefónica I+D-Global CTO**

### Cyan
“The intelligent NFV orchestration and placement proof-of-concept (PoC) with Telefónica at Mobile World Congress showcases the power of collaboration in driving real-world NFV use cases. The multi-vendor platform highlights how Brocade’s VNF and Telefónica’s VIM can expose performance requirements to Cyan’s enhanced infrastructure-aware NFV orchestrator. The orchestrator intelligently places VNFs on Intel servers to meet specific performance needs and efficiently uses compute resources to deliver end-to-end services. This is a critical issue for the industry to address for large-scale NFV deployment.”
- **Mike Hatfield, President, Cyan**

### Brocade
“Brocade supports advancements in intelligent orchestration and continued partnership within open initiatives. The flexibility and openness of Intel’s Network Builders Community have brought together committed partners to accelerate the transition to the New IP. The combined efforts of partners such as Telefónica, Intel, and Cyan highlight the key architecture benefits of Brocade’s VNF platforms, the Vyatta 5600 vRouter, and its open information data model. This underscores the value of NFV orchestrators and their importance in effective and optimal network deployments.”
- **Robert Bays, VP of Engineering, Brocade Software Networking**

### Intel
“Intel believes SDN-NFV is an industry inflection point and is committed to ensuring the new network architecture transformation is built on an open architecture using open standards. Intel is actively working through relevant standards and open source initiatives to make this a reality. Through the Open Networking Platform program, Intel will make all its components open source and work closely with Netbuilders SDN-NFV ecosystem partners like Cyan, Brocade, and Telefónica.”
- **Rene Torres, Intel SDN-NFV Marketing Director**

### Red Hat
“Building the foundation for an open NFV infrastructure requires expertise in Linux, KVM, and OpenStack, areas where Red Hat is a leading contributor. By collaborating on the NFV Reference Lab, we bring features and expertise back to the upstream OpenStack community and our carrier-grade Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack platform, enabling CSPs to implement their modernization plans through NFV.”
- **Radhesh Balakrishnan, General Manager, OpenStack, Red Hat**
