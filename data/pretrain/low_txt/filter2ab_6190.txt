### Title: Black Hat US-18: Snooping on Cellular Gateways and Their Critical Role in Industrial Control Systems (ICS)

To meet the growing demand for always-on, ubiquitous connectivity, the use of cellular technology is rapidly expanding, outpacing other forms of wireless mobile connectivity. My research in the Internet of Things (IoT) space has uncovered a range of vulnerabilities associated with cellular devices, particularly those manufactured by Sierra Wireless and others. While proper disclosures have been made, many manufacturers have been slow to respond. This delay prompted an examination of numerous publicly disclosed vulnerabilities that are considered "low-hanging fruit" for attackers targeting cellular devices and other cellular-based network modems, often used as out-of-band management interfaces.

The research delved into the details provided in configuration templates available for each device, including:
- Wireless Network Information
- IPSec Tunnel Authentication Details
- Connected Devices and Services

To protect the organizations, individuals, and companies involved, this presentation will focus on obfuscated examples. It will provide an in-depth look at the services and systems information of commonly deployed cellular-connected devices, specifically in the following areas:
- Emergency Response Systems
- Resource Collection Systems
- Transportation Safety
- Out-of-Band Management

This presentation aims to highlight the ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited and the critical role that cellular gateways play in industrial control systems.
