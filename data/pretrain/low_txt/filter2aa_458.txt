### What Are Theft of Service (ToS) Attacks?
**Definition:**
- **Application Level Attack:** The attacker gains increased access to restricted or limited resources.
- **Opportunistic Attack:** Typically, these attacks do not result in system administration access.

**Example Targets:**
- Software Registrations & Downloads
- Adult Websites
- Web Hosting Accounts
- Proxy/Anonymity Services
- Dial-up Internet Service
- Email/Usenet Service
- Shell Accounts
- Financial News Services
- Domain Name Registrations

**What Is Stolen?**
- Increased access to a service provider's systems (e.g., Shell Accounts)
- Avoidance of DNS Registration Fees
- Usenet Access
- Dial-up Internet Access
- Web hosting for data piracy, pornography storage, email spamming, etc.
- Increased access to restricted content
- Software

### Common Security Holes Used for ToS Attacks
- Instant Account Creation Vulnerabilities
- Subscription Data in HTML Forms
- Authentication Data Stored in User Cookies
- PayPal Subscription Payments
- Application, Server, or Operating System-Specific Vulnerability Exploits

### Obscuring the Attack
- Placing orders during holiday weekends when backlogs may result in less attention to order details.
- Even with human review, high sales volume might cause the attack to be overlooked.

### Who Is the Attacker?
- A Technically Savvy Customer
- A Competitor
- An Email Spammer or Other Criminal
- Someone Looking for a Deal
- A Legitimate Customer’s Friend

### Types of Theft of Service Attacks
#### 1. Software Copy Protection Circumvention
- **Cracks & Serial Number Websites:**
  - www.astalavista.box.sk
  - www.cracks.am
  - www.cerials.net
  - www.cracks.wz
- **Piracy Newsgroups on Usenet:**
  - alt.binaries.cracks
  - alt.binaries.warez.0-day
  - alt.binaries.cd.image

#### 2. Abuse of a Legitimate Account
- Using "login"/"password" as the username/password pair for easier sharing.
- Multiple users on a single account, which is easy to detect but often results in account termination if detected.
- Cookie Poisoning: Altering cookie data to assume the identity of a subscribing user.
  - **Tools:**
    - Cookie Editor v1.5 (Available from http://www.proxoft.com/CookieEditor.asp)
    - WinHex (Ability to edit non-persistent cookies in memory, available from http://www.sf-soft.de/)

#### 3. Bypassing the Billing System
- **Free Trial Accounts:**
  - Open to repeated use and abuse.
  - Users can disqualify themselves if they have previously used the same credit card or email address.
  - Vulnerable to repeated credit card fraud.
  - Easy to obtain new credit cards and email addresses.
- **Application Specific Attacks:**
  - Bugs in the account signup process.
  - "Account Verification" pages that can be used to reactivate canceled accounts.
  - Subscription and account maintenance vulnerabilities, such as upgrade/downgrade processes.

#### 4. Subscription Specific Attacks
- Altering subscription terms (e.g., Premium Account at Basic Account Price).
- Attacking the re-subscription process.
- Using user verification pages to reactivate accounts.

#### 5. HTML Form Alteration Attacks
- For "GET" forms, change URL parameters.
- For "POST" forms, view the HTML source and change the value of hidden input types.
- **HTTP_REFERER:**
  - Used to validate that the form was loaded from the proper domain.
  - Easy to defeat by faking the HTTP_REFERER.

### Beating Safari’s Security
- **O’Reilly’s Safari Bookshelf:**
  - Enforces a "No Offline Archiving" policy.
  - Three strikes and you're out if the system detects massive downloading.
  - Session Limit: One login allowed (Cookie-based session tracking).
  - Restriction on Library Access: Can only select X number of titles (X varies with subscription type).

**Exploits:**
- Free Trial Account Abuse: Get a new email address, sign up for a 14-day trial with a new credit card, pick books, make an offline copy, cancel the account, and repeat.
- **Tools:**
  - Offline Explorer (Used version 2.8.1220 Service Release 1 during testing).
  - Wget (Not successfully tested).

### ITKnowledge.com
- Offered a 14-day trial once per credit card.
- Similar to O’Reilly, but unsuccessful in stopping offline archiving via login cookies.
- Created their own security hole by offering another 14-day free trial to previous subscribers, which never expired.

### eBay Seller Fee Avoidance
- Use of the non-baying bidder form to negate eBay listing fees.
- Automated refund system.
- No incentive for buyers to report seller fraud when compensated.

### Software Theft with PayPal
- Users pay a fee to learn the value of the "return" HTML form variable.
- Automated key return and PayPal price alteration.
- Small, legitimate payments made, but the system does not verify the correct amount.

### Preventing Form Alteration
- **Method #1: Variable Change Detection**
  - CRC checksum of form variables.
  - Open to reverse engineering attacks.
  - Does not guarantee security but makes attacks more complex.
- **Method #2: Not Using Form Variables**
  - Extra programming and complexity required for server-side session tracking.
  - Security is not guaranteed; systems could still be vulnerable to other attacks.

### Detecting and Protecting Against ToS
- **Detection:**
  - Audit existing orders/subscriptions to verify subscription parameters.
  - Look for sudden increases in system utilization.
  - Verify the amount paid matches the amount owed.
- **Protection:**
  - Verify all orders manually.
  - Regularly audit account activity.
  - Do not overlook accounting inconsistencies.
  - Fix security holes promptly.

### Response Options
- **Depends on the nature of the attack:**
  - Account Cancellation
  - Account Modification
  - Back Billing
  - Involving Law Enforcement
  - Writing off the loss

### Final Points
- Sites vulnerable to ToS attacks are often vulnerable to other simple attacks.
- Most effective on newer websites using custom applications or misconfigured third-party products.
- Easy to perform, and legal fraud is not always committed.
- A company could be put out of business by the time it notices a vulnerability has been discovered.
