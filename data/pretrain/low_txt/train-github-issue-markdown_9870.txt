## 📝 Feature Request: Prioritize Currently Running Processes in PowerToys Run

When using PowerToys Run to search for and open currently running processes, it would be helpful if the results that match the search string with high confidence were displayed at the top. Currently, running processes often appear at the bottom of the list, below matches for other programs and even file results, which can be less relevant.

### Suggested Improvement:
- Display 1 or 2 currently running processes that match the search string with high confidence at the top of the results list.
