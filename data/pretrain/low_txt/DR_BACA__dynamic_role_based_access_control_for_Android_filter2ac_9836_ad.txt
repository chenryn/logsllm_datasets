### Battery Consumption Comparison

We evaluated the battery consumption of an unmodified Android 4.0.4 system against a DR BACA-enabled Android 4.0.4 system. The applications considered in this test include: Calendar (17), Calculator2 (22), Browser (23), Gallery3d (24), Videoeditor (25), Contacts (27), Music (28), and Talk (29).

**Test Configurations:**
- **No DR BACA:** This configuration uses the standard Android 4.0.4 system without any modifications.
- **DR BACA Policy A:** In this configuration, DR BACA is enabled and prevents all the listed applications from starting.
- **DR BACA Policy B:** In this configuration, DR BACA is enabled but allows the execution of all the listed applications. This configuration can be directly compared to the unmodified system, which by default allows all applications to run.

**Battery Life Test Results:**

| Configuration        | Battery Life (minutes) | Battery Life (hours) |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| No DR BACA           | 720                    | 12                   |
| DR BACA Policy A     | 750                    | 12.5                 |
| DR BACA Policy B     | 660                    | 11                   |

In the user simulation test, the battery life for the unmodified Android 4.0.4 system lasted for 720 minutes (12 hours). Interestingly, the configuration with DR BACA using Policy A extended the battery life by 30 minutes. This improvement is attributed to the security policy, which prevents many applications from starting and thus conserves resources. While this result does not provide information on the additional performance overhead introduced by DR BACA, it demonstrates that, depending on the chosen security policy, DR BACA can help preserve battery life.

The configuration with DR BACA using Policy B, which allows all applications to run, showed a reduction in battery life to 660 minutes (11 hours). This represents an 8.4% decrease compared to the unmodified system. The overhead includes the cost of receiving a new GPS signal every 5 minutes, which is a resource-intensive function.

In a corporate environment, a reasonable requirement would be for the device's battery to last at least an entire workday (8-9 hours). As shown, a DR BACA-enabled mobile device meets this requirement. The negative impact on battery life introduced by DR BACA remains within an acceptable range. It should be noted that DR BACA, in its current development stage, has not yet been optimized for performance.

### Related Work

The popularity of Android as a mobile operating system, combined with the increasing prevalence of Android malware, has led many security researchers to propose new security solutions to mitigate vulnerabilities.

**CRePE [6] and CtRBAC [33]:**
- CRePE (Context-Related Policy Enforcement for Android) allows for the definition of fine-grained policies even after installation, focusing on restricting non-malicious applications based on context information such as location and time.
- DR BACA also provides context-based restrictions but uses a role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism, which is better suited for corporate environments.
- CtRBAC (Context-Related Role-Based Access Control) leverages RBAC to provide finer-grained access control, but it only allows one role per user. DR BACA, on the other hand, supports multiple roles and offers a fully implemented and production-ready solution.

**Saint [21]:**
- Saint enhances the Android security model with install-time and runtime permission granting policies, including context information. DR BACA similarly uses both permission and application-level rules but adds RBAC and role associations for better security management.

**SELinux [29]:**
- SELinux strengthens the Linux kernel with type enforcement and limited RBAC, protecting the system from compromised root-privileged applications. While DR BACA does not modify the kernel, it can be integrated with SELinux for enhanced security.

**Permission Re-Delegation (PRD) Attacks:**
- Solutions like IPC Inspection [8], TrustDroid [3], and XManDroid [2] aim to mitigate PRD attacks through various mechanisms. DR BACA does not directly address PRD attacks but can mitigate them through appropriate security policies and context-aware controls.

### Conclusion

We propose and fully implement DR BACA (Dynamic Role-Based Access Control) to enhance Android security. By integrating RBAC with Android’s permission model, leveraging context-aware capabilities, and utilizing NFC technology, DR BACA provides fine-grained access control. It is ideal for enterprises, offering multi-user capabilities and simplifying the implementation of uniform security policies across devices. With a proper security policy, DR BACA can mitigate security risks with minimal system overhead.

In future work, we plan to provide an API for developers to integrate DR BACA into their applications and to synchronize DR BACA with anti-virus vendors to dynamically update security policies and blacklist malicious applications.
