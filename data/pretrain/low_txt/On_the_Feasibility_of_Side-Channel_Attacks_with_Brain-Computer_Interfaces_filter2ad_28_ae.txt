### Security and Privacy Implications of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Technology

In this paper, we designed and conducted a series of experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of using a low-cost, consumer-grade BCI gaming device to partially reveal private and sensitive information from users. In these experiments, participants were engaged in classification tasks involving various images (i.e., stimuli). By analyzing the captured EEG signals, we were able to identify which stimuli were related to the user's private or sensitive information, such as credit card details, PIN numbers, known individuals, or the user's place of residence. The experiments revealed that the information leakage, measured by information entropy, ranged from 10% to 20% of the total information, with the potential to increase up to approximately 43%.

The simplicity of our experiments suggests the possibility of more sophisticated attacks. For example, an unsuspecting user could be easily enticed into "mind-games" that disguise the interrogation process, making them more cooperative. Additionally, as the quality of BCI devices continues to improve, the success rates of such attacks are likely to increase. Another critical issue is that current APIs available to third-party developers provide full access to the raw EEG signal. This is difficult to avoid because complex EEG signal processing is typically outsourced to the application. As a result, the development of new attacks can be relatively straightforward and is limited only by the creativity of the attacker.
