  - Minimizing risk through secure design, coding, static analysis, vulnerability testing, and incident response.

#### Product Lifecycle Security
- **Product Security Activities:**
  - Threat analysis
  - Secure design
  - Secure coding
  - Static analysis
  - Vulnerability testing
  - Incident response
  - Minimize risk
  - Incident containment
  - Plan
  - Shipment
  - Discard
  - Design
  - Implement
  - Test
  - In-use

#### Cyber Security Framework
- **IT Security:**
  - Web-site, PC, server, network, data, and application
  - CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team)
- **Product Security:**

### Panasonic IoT Threat Intelligence Project

#### Challenges in Product Security
- **Trigger Requirement:**
  - Incident response requires internal or external notification.
  - Proactively analyze and utilize threat information.
- **Goals:**
  - Collect malware targeting home electronics.
  - Strengthen overall IoT security through a platform.
  - Analyze malware characteristics.

#### IoT Threat Collection
- **Real-time Collection:**
  - Using IoT home electronics.
  - Ability to collect attacks against products in development.
  - Increase global coverage of observation points.

#### IoT Threat Analysis
- **Behavior Analysis:**
  - Specialized for IoT malware.
  - Automated processing from collection to analysis/statistics.
- **Feedback to Product Developers:**
  - Categorize attacks using standard frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK).
  - Analyze targeted vulnerabilities to assess countermeasures.
  - Share attack overviews and IoT malware analysis with developers.

#### Accomplishments
- **Data Collected (November 2017 – June 2020):**
  - Attacks collected: 603,589,498
  - Malware collected: 56,426
  - IoT malware collected: 12,634
  - Home electronics with malicious files placed: 2 types

#### Attack Trends
- **Top 10 Attacked Protocols:**
  - MSSQL, UPnP, Telnet, SSH
- **Top 5 Attack Sources by Country:**
  - China, USA, Taiwan, Japan, Germany

#### Malware Analysis
- **Collected Malware:**
  - 66% known malware, 34% unknown malware.
  - Daily collection ranges from a couple to 150-170 samples.
  - No direct correlation between the number of attacks and the number of collected malware samples.
- **Targeted Architectures:**
  - Most Linux-based malware targets PC/Servers (i386 and amd64).
  - 30% of total attacks target IoT architecture.
  - ARM and MIPS are the main targets for IoT malware.
  - Most IoT malware collected are gafgyt and mirai family.

#### Case Studies
- **EchoBot (Mirai variant):**
  - Disguises process name after intrusion.
  - Scans for vulnerabilities and performs DDoS functions.
- **LiquorBot (Mirai variant rewritten in golang):**
  - Scans for vulnerabilities in many IoT devices.
  - Performs brute force attacks for SSH.
  - Recognized as non-malicious by VirusTotal.
- **Sandbot (Tsunami variant):**
  - Packed by UPX.
  - Infects through telnet and drops connection after infection.
  - Supports command to deploy bot as C2.
