The true loss rate is generally within these bounds. The SLAM (Service Level Agreement Monitoring) tool effectively tracks the loss rate over time, with its estimated mean closely following the true loss mean.

## Discussion and Conclusions

SLAM represents a significant advancement in SLA (Service Level Agreement) compliance monitoring using active measurements. However, several issues remain to be addressed. 

Firstly, there are additional considerations in a network-wide setting. For instance, a deployment strategy must be developed to coordinate probe streams, ensuring that internal links do not carry excessive measurement traffic. A key question is: given a daily or other time-based budget of probes for monitoring SLA compliance, what are the optimal strategies for probe allocation? Should the probing period be extended over a long time scale, potentially limiting the accuracy of estimates, or should it be shorter, improving accuracy but at the risk of missing important events?

In this paper, we have assumed that perfect accuracy is the goal for compliance monitoring. However, for some SLAs, a predictable tradeoff between accuracy and measurement overhead may be acceptable. Our examples of distributional inference have focused on delay, and we plan to examine loss more closely in future work. While measuring availability in simple path-oriented scenarios is straightforward, applying performance tomography to infer network-wide availability may be insufficient in the face of routing changes.

In summary, this paper introduces a new methodology for SLA compliance monitoring using active measurements, including methods for measuring end-to-end packet loss, mean delay, and delay variation. We propose a new method for obtaining confidence intervals on the empirical delay distribution and a new approach for inferring lower bounds on the quantiles of a performance metric along a path in a network-wide setting from a subset of known paths. We implemented these methods in a tool called SLAM, which unifies various probe streams, resulting in lower overall probe volume. We evaluated SLAM's capabilities in a controlled laboratory environment under various traffic conditions and in one- and two-hop settings. Our results show that SLAM's delay and loss rate estimates are significantly more accurate than those obtained through standard probe methodologies. Additionally, we demonstrated the convergence and robustness properties of SLAM's loss, delay, and delay variation estimates, making it suitable for operational use.
