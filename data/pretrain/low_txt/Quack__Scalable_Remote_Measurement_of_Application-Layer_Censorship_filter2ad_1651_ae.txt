### Tendency to Select Domains from the Most Popular

Countries such as China, Egypt, and Turkey exhibit a pronounced tendency to block popular domains more frequently, with Turkey showing the strongest trend. This behavior may indicate a reactive blocking strategy, where domains are added to a blacklist when they are detected to be frequently visited by citizens.

### Alexa Top 100k Experiment

The Alexa Top 100k experiment provides a snapshot of the state of application-layer censorship on HTTP and HTTPS. While it is just one point in time, we believe it demonstrates the flexibility and accuracy of our tool. In the future, this tool can contribute valuable data to diverse, longitudinal, and in-depth studies of application-layer censorship.

## Discussion

This paper proposes and validates a technique for measuring application-layer interference globally. In this section, we discuss the limitations of our design and the additional research opportunities our tool enables.

### Limitations

Our system currently relies on echo servers to gain insights into remote client experiences of the Internet. However, existing remote measurement techniques, including ours, can be detected and invalidated or blocked by middleboxes.

#### Port 7 Blocking
First, a censor could block all traffic through port 7. We have limited information about who or what else might be using port 7 today, so it is unclear how much collateral damage such a block would cause. Fortunately, our system is not dependent on the Echo Protocol specifically; other protocols like FTP, Telnet, and TLS also offer echo services. These alternatives are more widely used and would be more difficult to block entirely.

#### IP-Based Blocking
Second, a censor could block our measurement machine by IP. One of the key advantages of our system is its portability, allowing measurements to be run from virtually any machine around the world. Therefore, any IP-based filtering of our measurements would likely be unsuccessful, as we could quickly and easily deploy in another location.

#### Directional Blocking
Finally, a censor could watch for the direction of a connection and block only those originating from inside their network. However, such a policy would not prevent services from pushing data to clients, as can occur in FTP. In practice, we are not aware of directional blocking of this nature, possibly due to the complexity of AS peering, which blurs the distinction between internal and external networks at a nation-state level.

Despite these potential disruptions, both distributed and remote censorship measurement systems in use today remain differentiable and disruptable. Even if some censors decide to disrupt measurements, we will continue to have visibility into the rest of the world.

### Detecting Heterogeneous Deployments

Another limitation is the difficulty in detecting countries with heterogeneous deployments of keyword blocking, as we considered only widespread blocking in this work. Future work could remove the final Classifying Interference step and combine raw data with other network disruption measurement techniques to increase the granularity of observations.

### False Negatives

In our study, we encountered false negatives where DPI boxes monitor only ports 80 and 443 for web traffic. We could have conducted all experiments with our client port set to the appropriate well-known port for the protocol being measured. However, we believed the trade-off was best to follow common practices and use an ephemeral port for our client connections.

### Global Detection

For global detection, there are on average 177 countries with echo servers, and only 74 with at least 15 vantage points. One potential way to increase the number of vantage points is to send formatted requests to any server that accepts packets, such as all web servers for HTTP. We would then differentiate between the web server’s error result and the interference behavior by country. However, this approach removes our ability to detect disruption that only inspects outbound packets from the network, which, based on our observations in Section 6.3, is significant in many countries that perform application-layer interference.

### Granularity of Observation

Our work makes a trade-off to detect censorship observed in multiple vantage points within each country, but this comes at the cost of reduced granularity. Consequently, we may not regularly observe censorship that is heterogeneously implemented within a given country and may not reliably observe particular ISP policies.

## Future Work

This paper describes a new and useful technique for remotely measuring network disruptions due to application-layer blocking. Disruption detection techniques can now monitor DNS poisoning, IP-based blocking, and application-layer censorship. When combined, these perspectives could produce valuable datasets for political scientists, activists, and other members of the Internet freedom community. Additionally, these remote measurement techniques complement in-country probes, such as OONI, to provide baselines and focus efforts.

The system presented here is capable of continuous measurement. Instead of running large batches of keywords, an optimized approach would cycle through a set of interesting domains in each country at a reduced rate, enabling longitudinal tracking and illuminating changes in application-layer censorship policies over time.

Quack also stands to provide insights into censorship of other application-layer data and can be generalized to use other protocols' echo behavior. While we focused on HTTP and HTTPS in this paper, the Echo protocol's ability to send and receive arbitrary data could be used to explore interference in other areas, such as the mobile web and app ecosystems. Future work can also explore using protocols other than the echo protocol to improve coverage of application-layer blocking measurement.

## Conclusion

Application-layer interference is broadly deployed today, critically limiting Internet freedom. Unlike other censorship techniques, we have not previously had broad and detailed visibility into its deployment. In this paper, we introduced Quack, a new system for remotely detecting application-layer interference at a global scale, utilizing servers already deployed on the Internet without the need to enlist volunteers to run network probes. We hope this new approach will help close an important gap in censorship monitoring and move us closer to having transparency and accountability for network interference worldwide.
