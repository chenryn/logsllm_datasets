### Overview
This presentation will delve into the vulnerabilities found in the application logic of a transit system. The focus is on how these flaws can be exploited to create a significant security breach.

### Transit System
- **System:** Elevated Train (Bangkok Mass Transit System, BTS)
- **Operator:** Bangkok Mass Transit System PCL (BTSC)
- **Coverage:** Serves Greater Bangkok Area
- **Stations:** 43 stations along two lines

### Tickets
- **Types:**
  - Stored-Value Card (NFC)
  - All Day Pass (Magstripe)
  - Single Journey (Magstripe)

#### Ticket Characteristics
- **All Day Pass and Single Journey:**
  - Two magstripes
  - One magstripe has a hole through it
  - Thickness: 0.27mm

### Equipment
- **Reader/Writer:**
  - Standard equipment manufactured in China
  - Capabilities: Standards or Raw Read
  - Performance: Reliable with rare errors

### Lab Work
- **Decoding Attempts:**
  - Using International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards
  - 6-bit and 4-bit character sets, with and without parity
  - Decoding both forwards and backwards
  - Conclusion: No encryption, no parity checks, no LRC, no timestamps

### Field Work
- **Ticket Sections:**
  - "7826" indicates the ticket type
  - "00FF74" represents 100 + the price of the ticket
  - For all-day passes, "00FF74" tracks trips taken

- **Handling Rules:**
  - To Enter: Ticket must have been in "Collected" state and now in "Issued" state
  - To Exit: Ticket must be in "Used" state

### Exploiting the System
- **System Safeguards:**
  - Ticket Composition and Design
  - Handling Rules Define Valid Use
  - Lifecycle limited to 24 hours
  - Collection of ticket after use

- **Assumptions:**
  - No one can reproduce the ticket
  - Only valid objects are within the system
  - Handling rules prevent concurrent use
  - Damage is limited by lifecycle
  - After use, the ticket will be in the system's possession

- **Attacks Against Assumptions:**
  - Acquire a suitable ticket
  - Capture a valid object
  - Bypass handling rules
  - Extend the attack to increase damage

- **Exploit Details:**
  - Found a way to make blank tickets
  - Copied a large number of objects in "Issued" state
  - Discovered a flaw in the handling rules: "Collected" state overrides other states
  - Original ticket can be run, making all copies valid

### Turning the Exploit into an Attack
- **Plan:**
  1. Buy a daily pass ticket
  2. Copy the ticket
  3. Use the original ticket
  4. Hand out copies
  5. Repeat the next day

- **Results:**
  - Extended the attack to test all layers of the solution
  - Identified application issues
  - Checked assumptions
  - Used compensating and mitigating controls

### Avoiding Their Fate
- **Recommendations:**
  - Test all layers of the solution
  - Check for application issues
  - Verify assumptions
  - Implement compensating and mitigating controls
