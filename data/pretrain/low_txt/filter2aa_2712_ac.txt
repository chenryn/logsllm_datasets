### Setting Up a Server as a Windows Domain Member

Using Server Admin, you can configure Mac OS X Server to join a Windows domain hosted by a Mac OS X Server primary domain controller (PDC). A server that joins a Windows domain receives authentication services from the PDC. This domain member server can also provide file, print, browsing, and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) functionalities. Additionally, it can host user profiles and home directories for users with accounts on the PDC. The domain member server does not provide authentication services to other domain members.

#### Steps to Join Mac OS X Server to the Windows Domain of a Mac OS X Server PDC:

1. **Open Server Admin:**
   - Select "Windows" for the server in the Computers & Services list.

2. **Configure General Settings:**
   - Click "Settings" (near the bottom of the window).
   - Click "General" (near the top).

3. **Set the Role:**
   - Choose "Domain Member" from the Role pop-up menu.
   - Enter a description, computer name, and domain.

   - **Description:** This is optional and appears in the Network Neighborhood window on Windows computers.
   - **Computer Name:** This is the NetBIOS name and should contain no more than 15 characters, no special characters, and no punctuation. It is recommended to match the unqualified DNS host name. For example, if your DNS server has an entry for your server as "server.example.com," use "server."
   - **Domain:** Enter the name of the Windows domain that the server will join. The domain must be hosted by a Mac OS X Server PDC and cannot exceed 15 characters or be "WORKGROUP."

4. **Save the Configuration:**
   - Click "Save."

5. **Enter PDC Credentials:**
   - Enter the name and password of a user account that can administer the LDAP directory domain on the PDC server, then click "OK."

### Supporting Windows Client Computers

Mac OS X Server supports the native Windows file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), also known as Common Internet File System (CIFS). Mac OS X Server comes with built-in browsing and name resolution services for your Windows client computers. You can enable Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) on your server, or you can register with an existing WINS server.

### Windows Services in Mac OS X Server

Windows services in Mac OS X Server include Windows Master Browser and Domain Master Browser services. You do not need a Windows server or a primary domain controller on your network to allow Windows users to see your server listed in the My Places window (Windows XP and 2000) or the Network Neighborhood window (Windows 95, 98, or ME). Enable the master browsers to allow Windows clients outside of your server’s subnet to access the server by name.

### Setting Up Windows Clients for TCP/IP Networking

To access Windows services, Windows client computers must be properly configured to connect over TCP/IP. See your Windows networking documentation for information on TCP/IP configuration.

### Connecting for File Service From Windows

A Windows user can connect to the Windows file service of Mac OS X Server using My Network Places in Windows XP or 2000 or the Network Neighborhood in Windows 95, 98, or Millennium Edition (ME).

#### Before Connecting:

- Find out the workgroup or domain of both the client computer and the file server. The procedure depends on the Windows version:
  - **Windows XP:** Click "Start," "Control Panel," "Performance and Maintenance," double-click the "System" icon, and then click the "Computer Name" tab.
  - **Windows 2000:** Click "Start," "Settings," "Control Panel," double-click the "System" icon, and then click the "Network Identification" tab.
  - **Windows 95, 98, or ME:** Click "Start," "Settings," "Control Panel," double-click the "Network" icon, and then click the "Identification" tab.

- To find the server’s workgroup name, open Server Admin, click "Windows" in the Computers & Services list, click "Settings," then "General."

#### Steps to Connect to Windows File Service:

1. **Open Network Places:**
   - On the Windows client computer, open My Network Places (Windows XP or 2000) or the Network Neighborhood (Windows 95, 98, or ME). If you are in the same workgroup or domain as the server, skip to step 4.

2. **Navigate to the Entire Network:**
   - Double-click the "Entire Network" icon.

3. **Select Workgroup or Domain:**
   - Double-click the icon of the workgroup or domain where the server is located.

4. **Connect to the Server:**
   - Double-click the server’s icon.

5. **Authenticate:**
   - Use the short name and password of a user account stored on the server. The user account can be stored in the server’s local directory domain or its shared directory domain, if the server has one.

### Connecting to the Server by Name or Address in Windows 95, 98, or ME

A Windows 95, 98, or Millennium Edition (ME) user can connect to Mac OS X Server for Windows file service without using the Network Neighborhood. This method requires knowing the server’s IP address or its Windows computer name (also known as its NetBIOS name).

#### Steps to Connect Without Using the Network Neighborhood:

1. **Find Computer:**
   - In Windows 95, 98, or ME, click "Start," "Find," then "Computer."

2. **Enter Server Name or IP Address:**
   - Type the name or IP address of your Windows server.

3. **Connect to the Server:**
   - Double-click the server to connect.

4. **Authenticate:**
   - Use the short name and password of a user account stored on the server. The user account can be stored in the server’s local directory domain or its shared directory domain, if the server has one.

### Connecting to the Server by Name or Address in Windows XP

A Windows XP user can connect to Mac OS X Server for Windows file service without using My Network Places. This method requires knowing the server’s IP address or its Windows computer name (also known as its NetBIOS name).

#### Steps to Connect Without Using My Network Places:

1. **Search for Computer:**
   - In Windows XP, click "Start," "Search," "Computers or people," then "A computer on the network."

2. **Enter Server Name or IP Address:**
   - Type the name or IP address of your Windows server.

3. **Connect to the Server:**
   - Double-click the server to connect.

4. **Authenticate:**
   - Use the short name and password of a user account stored on the server. The user account can be stored in the server’s local directory domain or its shared directory domain, if the server has one.

### Setting Up Windows Clients for Print Service

To enable printing by Windows users who submit jobs using SMB, make sure Windows services are running and that one or more print queues are available for SMB use.

All Windows computers—including Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition (ME), and Windows XP—support SMB for using printers on the network. Windows 2000 and Windows NT also support LPR.

**Note:** Third-party LPR drivers are available for Windows computers that do not have built-in LPR support.

### Administering Windows Users, Groups, Computers, and Share Points

You can manage accounts for Windows users, groups of Windows users, and a computer list account for Windows workstations. You can also manage SMB share points.

#### User Accounts, Group Accounts, Computer Accounts, and Share Points

- **User Account:** Stores data needed for authenticating Windows users and providing services such as Windows domain login, roaming user profiles, home directories, file service, and mail service.
- **Group Account:** Offers a simple way to control access to files and folders by storing the identities of users who belong to the group.
- **Computer Account:** Lists computers available to the same users and groups. The Windows Computers account lists the Windows workstations that have joined the Windows domain of the PDC.
- **Share Point:** A folder, hard disk, or hard disk partition made accessible over the network.

To make Windows services usable, Mac OS X Server needs accounts for Windows users, groups, and workstations, as well as share points for Windows services.

### Setup Overview

Here is a summary of the major tasks you perform to set up users, groups, computers, and share points for Windows services. See the pages indicated for detailed information about each step.

#### Step 1: Set up share points (optional)
- Share folders and volumes with users on the network by designating them as share points. On a server that is a PDC, share points are created automatically for roaming user profiles and home directories. You can set up alternate share points for home directories and user profiles on a PDC server or a domain member server. Additionally, you can set up other share points for files and folders that Windows users need to share. See “Managing SMB Share Points” on page 41.

#### Step 2: Set up user accounts
- Each Windows user who will log in to the Windows domain must have a user account. A user who will not log in to the Windows domain but will use Windows file service or mail service must also have a user account. See “Managing Accounts for Windows Users” on this page.

#### Step 3: Join workstations to the Windows domain
- If Windows workstations will be used for Windows domain login, they must join the Windows domain. You can set up Windows workstations to join the Mac OS X Server PDC just as you would set up workstations to join a Windows NT server’s domain. For example, in Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional, you could use the Network Identification Wizard.
- When a Windows workstation joins the PDC, Mac OS X Server automatically adds the workstation to the server’s computer account named Windows Computers. You can also add workstations to this account by using Workgroup Manager. See “Managing Windows Workstations in the Windows Computers Account” on page 39.

#### Step 4: Set up group accounts for Windows users (optional)
- You only need to do this if you want to use groups to set file permissions based on groups. Note that Mac OS X Server does not support NT-style ACLs. The differences: on Mac OS X Server, you can assign only a single group privilege (and a single individual user privilege) to a particular file or folder. On a Windows NT server, you can assign a wider range of permissions. See “Managing Groups for Windows Users” on page 38.

### Managing Accounts for Windows Users

A user account stores data needed to validate a user’s identity and provide services for the user, such as access to particular files on the server. If the user account resides on a server that is a primary domain controller (PDC) or on a server that is a member of a Windows domain governed by a PDC, the user account also enables someone using a Windows computer to log in to the Windows domain. The same user account can be used to log in to a Mac OS X computer.

#### Where Windows User Accounts Are Stored

- User accounts for Windows users can be stored in any directory domain accessible from the computer that needs to access the account.
- To be used for Windows domain login from a Windows computer, a user account must be stored in the LDAP directory domain of the Mac OS X Server that is the primary domain controller (PDC).
- A Windows user account that is not stored in the PDC’s LDAP directory domain can be used to access other services. For example, a user account in the local directory domain of a Mac OS X Server can be used to access Windows file service provided by the same server.

See the Open Directory administration guide for complete information about the different kinds of directory domains.

### Creating Windows User Accounts in the Primary Domain Controller

You can use Workgroup Manager to create a user account on a Mac OS X Server PDC. Windows users with accounts on a Mac OS X Server that is the primary domain controller (PDC) can log in to the Windows domain from a Windows workstation. These user accounts can also be used for other Windows services. You need administrator privileges for a directory domain to create a new user account in it.

#### Steps to Create a User Account in the PDC:

1. **Open Workgroup Manager:**
   - Click "Accounts," then click the "User" button.
