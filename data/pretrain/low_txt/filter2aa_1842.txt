## Background
- Shorten the gap between penetration testing and actual attacks.
- Few covert persistence tools available.
- Reduce reliance on Metasploit.

## Overview
- DLL Injection
- Persistence Techniques
- Throwback
- Demonstrations throughout the presentation

## DLL Injection
### Traditional Methods
- `CreateRemoteThread()`
- `NtCreateThreadEx()`
- `RtlCreateUserThread()`
- `NtQueueApcThread()`
  - Can cause blue screens on certain operating systems.
  
### Code Cave Method
- Suspend the target process.
- Inject code into the process.
- Change the EIP (Instruction Pointer) to the location of the injected code.
- Resume the process.
  - Note: This method is more challenging on x64 systems.

### AddMonitor()
- Injects into `spoolsv.exe`.
- Does not require matching architecture.
- Easy to use.
- Dll must be on disk.
- Requires administrator privileges.

### DLL Injection Demo

## Persistence
- Many persistence mechanisms in Windows:
  - Services
  - Run keys
  - Scheduled tasks
  - And more to discover…

### Persistence Techniques
- **First Technique**
  - Requires VMware Tools to be installed.
  - Drop a dll to `c:\windows\system32\wbem\ntdsapi.dll`.
  - The dll must export the same functions as the real `ntdsapi.dll`.

- **Second Technique**
  - VMware patched in ESXi 5.5.
  - Requires VMware Tools to be installed.
  - Drop a dll to `c:\windows\system32\wbem\tpgenlic.dll` or `c:\windows\system32\wbem\thinmon.dll`.

- **Third Technique**
  - Modify the registry at `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors\`.
  - Create a new key.
  - Create a new value named "Driver" with the dll name.
  - Multiple entries can be created.

### Persistence Demo

## Windows API HTTP Cheatsheet
- **WinHTTP**
  - Intended for services.
  - Does not pull user proxy settings.
  - Supports impersonation.

- **WinINet**
  - More robust in proxy environments.
  - Various flags to enable/disable functionality automatically.
  - Prompts the user for a password if authentication is required.
  - Uses Internet Explorer settings.

## What is Throwback?
- C++ HTTP/S beaconing backdoor.
- PHP control panel with MySQL backend.
- Built for stealth.
- Includes built-in persistence.
- Available as both a dll and an exe.

### Architecture
- Infected User
- Proxy/Firewall
- Throwback Listener (LP)
- Attacker
- Throwback Listener (LP)

### Features
- Robust proxy detection.
- Distributed listeners.
- Uses MSGRPC to generate Metasploit payloads.
- RC4 encrypted communications.
- Implements reflective dll injection.
- String encryption.

### Throwback Demo

## Going Forward
- Community-based project.
- Develop modules (keylogger, Mimikatz, hashdump, etc.).
- Explore various transport methods.
- Implement additional persistence techniques.
- Modify communication protocols.
