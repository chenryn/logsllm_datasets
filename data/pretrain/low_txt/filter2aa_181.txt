### High Security Locks and Standards

**Normal vs. High Security:**
- Facility specifications based on UL/ANSI standards.
- Protection against:
  - Forced entry
  - Covert entry
  - Key control
- Protection of high-value and critical targets.

**UL-437 Attack Resistance (Door Locks and Cylinders):**
- **Driving:** 5 minutes
- **Pulling:** 5 minutes
- **Prying:** 5 minutes
- **Sawing:** 5 minutes
- **Drilling:** 5 minutes
- **Forcing:** 10 minutes
- **Impressioning:** 10 minutes
- **Picking:** 10 minutes

**ANSI/BHMA (A156.5) Standards:**
- **Auxiliary Locks:**
  - Graded 1-3 (Grade 1 being the highest).
- **High Security Cylinders:**
  - Graded A-C (Grade A being the highest).

**ANSI A156.5 Security Tests:**
- Impact
- Tension
- Torque
- Sawing
- Pressure
- Tensile
- Drilling (5 minutes)
- Picking (10 minutes)

**ANSI A156.30 High Security Cylinders:**
- **Key Control (cumulative ratings):**
  - **C:** Manufacturer-restricted blanks
  - **B:** Blanks protected by law
  - **A:** Authorization required
- **Forced Entry Extensions (above A156.5):**

**Pick Resistance (Cumulative):**
- **C:** Minimum of 2 security pins, paracentric keyway, and one bore depth to prevent overlifting.
- **B:** Meets all levels of C plus UL-437 for pick resistance (10 minutes).
- **A:** Resists picking for 15 minutes as tested by 5 ALOA Certified Locksmiths with commercially available tools.

**What is "High Security"?**
- **UL-437 Standards:**
  - Cabinet locks
  - Door locks
  - Locking cylinders
  - Security containers
  - Two-key locks

**Higher Security (Not High Security):**
- Tests include:
  - Endurance
  - Attack resistance
  - Corrosion
  - Material strength

**UL-437 Attack Resistance:**
- A product shall not open or be compromised by:
  - Common hand tools
  - Hand or portable electronic tools
  - Saw blades
  - Puller mechanisms
  - Picking tools

**UL-437 Tools (Hand or Electric):**
- Pry bars (up to 3 ft)
- Chisels
- Screwdrivers (max 15 in)
- Hammers (max 3 lbs)
- Wrenches
- Pliers
- Drills
- Saw blades
- Pulling tools

**LOCKS:**
- Drilling
- Pulling
- Prying
- Sawing
- Picking
- Impressioning

**Forced Entry - Drilling:**
- Drilling a standard cylinder vs. a high-security cylinder.

**Forced Entry - Pulling:**
- Use of a puller on the plug (e.g., MUL-T-LOCK).

**Forced Entry - Prying:**
- Prying techniques.

**Forced Entry - Sawing:**
- Sawing techniques.

**Covert Entry - Picking:**
- Picking techniques.

**Covert Entry - Impressioning:**
- Impressioning techniques.

**Common Hand Tools:**
- Various tools used for forced and covert entry.

### LIES

**Representations by Manufacturers:**
- Claims that locks are secure.
- Distinction between high-security and standard locks.
- Implied representations.
- Known or should-have-known issues.
- Meeting specifications.
- Need for truth in packaging and advertising.

**Design Issues:**
- Failure of imagination.
- Design engineer problems.
- Key never unlocks the lock (Moshe Dyan problem).
- Many certified locks can be compromised.
- Public is misled.

**Mechanical Bypass:**
- Defeating locks in less than a minute.
- Not included in standards (neither forced nor covert entry).
- Techniques:
  - Wires and shims
  - Vibration, shock, bumping
  - Air pressure
  - Magnetics
  - Breaking internal components
  - Radio Frequency energy
  - Temperature

**Case Examples:**
- El Safe (UnSafe) hotel safe
- File cabinet locks
- Targus Defcon CL
- Padlocks (Master and Corbin Sesamee)
- Codelock electronic lock
- Kwikset
- Medeco

**El Safe in Room Hotel Safe:**
- Security = gear drive in back of door.

**File Cabinet Locks:**
- Security = spring-loaded locking dog.

**Targus Defcon CL:**
- Piece of plastic to decode gate position.

**Padlocks:**
- Master combination
- Corbin Sesamee

**Codelocks CL1000:**
- Security = spring-loaded blocking tab.

**Codelocks 5000:**
- Moshe Dyan problem: Drain hole out, wire in.

**Kwikset Maximum Security:**
- Defective design.
- No real security.
- Opens in under 30 seconds.
- No apparent evidence of entry.

**Kwikset Ultra Max:**
- No real security.
- Defective design.

**Common Myths:**
- Key Control
- Bumping
- Picking
- Mechanical Bypass

**Medeco: The High Security Cylinder:**
- Protects high-value and critical targets.
- For 35 years: THE lock to attack.
- UL437 and ANSI 156.30 rated.
- Advertising statements:
  - "Bump-proof"
  - Highly pick-resistant
  - Key control
  - Secure

**Medeco “CAVEATS”:**
- High-quality locks and hardware.
- Secure for most locations and uses.
- May be vulnerable for high-value targets.
- User needs to assess security.
- Security depends on:
  - Location and value of target
  - Expected sophistication of attack
  - Master key or non-master key system

**Medeco m3:**
- Replaced the Biaxial in 2005 when the patent expired.
- Biaxial design with slider.
- Three levels of security:
  - Pin tumblers elevated to shear line
  - Pin tumblers rotated to correct angles
  - Slider moved to correct position

**Common Myth #1: Key Control:**
- UL 437: No key control criteria.
- ANSI 156.30:
  - Patent-protected blanks
  - Cannot replicate the blanks
  - Cannot duplicate the keys
  - Factory control of keys produced by code

**Medeco Key Control:**
- Biaxial patent expired in 2005.
- Replaced with m3.
- m3 is protected but can be simulated.
- Restricted keyways can be bypassed.
- Security feature of m3 can be bypassed without infringing on the patent.

**Medeco m3 Meets the Paper Clip:**
- "Michaud M3 Degrade Attack"

**Common Myth #2: Bumping:**
- Some high-security locks can be bumped open.
- Depends on many factors.
- Sidebar codes must be known or simulated.
- Patent filing for technique to bump.

**Medeco Not Bump-Proof:**
- Medeco claims: "Our locks are bump-proof!" or "virtually bump-proof."
- Virtually bump-proof = virtual reality.

**Common Myth #3: Picking:**
- Special pick and decoder tools developed.
- Medeco locks can be extremely difficult to pick due to pin rotation.
- Target for 35 years.
- Attempts largely unsuccessful.
- Caveats.

**Picking Medeco Locks:**
- Can be picked with conventional tools using a special technique in patent filing.
- High percentage of these locks can be picked.

**Common Myth #4: Hardware Bypass:**
- Kwikset UltraMax and others.
- Medeco hardware security: Is it really secure?
- Example: Deadbolts - A failure of imagination.
- Entire security based on two small components.

**Medeco Security: Two Screws Loose!**
- Medeco Deadbolt Lock:
  - Security based on two tiny screws.
  - Can be compromised in under 30 seconds.
  - Will not meet high-security standards.
- UL and ANSI do not address this issue.
- Bypass of deadbolt mechanism.
- Design incompetence.
