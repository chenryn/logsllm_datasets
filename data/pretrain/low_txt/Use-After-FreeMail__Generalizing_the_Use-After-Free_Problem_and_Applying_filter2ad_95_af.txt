## CVE and Database Leak Statistics

**Figure 5** illustrates the evolution of the total number of CVEs and the number of use-after-free CVEs over the past decade. It shows that while the total number of CVEs remained relatively stable, the number of use-after-free CVEs has increased. **Figure 6** displays the cumulative number of accounts leaked in online database breaches over the same period, with a significant spike at the end of 2016 due to multiple large-scale leaks.

## Online Survey Demographics

### Distribution by Continent
**Figure 7** compares the distribution of survey participants across continents with the global distribution of internet users. Our dataset shows that Europe is overrepresented, while other regions are slightly underrepresented.

### Age Distribution
**Figure 8** presents the age distribution of the survey participants. The largest group is aged between 26 and 35, while the smallest group is 56 years and older.

## User Case Studies

### User Case Study #1
The participant had a Yahoo account that expired due to inactivity. This email address was involved in two database leaks from 2012, which were publicly released in 2016. We received emails with job offers revealing specific former job interests of the participant. Using password recovery functions, we compromised six of the participant's online accounts. In most cases, the account and password recovery processes were not protected by CAPTCHAs or anti-bot mechanisms. 

The participant was unaware that their exposure to attackers might have increased. Furthermore, they did not update the email address in several online accounts. Yahoo's 40-day deletion policy meant the email address became available again by the end of 2016. The email address appeared in several database leaks, including Dropbox, LinkedIn, Stratfor, and Tumblr.

We performed checks on popular websites and found that many services did not use two-factor authentication, allowing us to hijack the corresponding accounts. These included Amazon, Dropbox, eBay, and the national automobile club. By resetting the Dropbox password, we accessed personal information and files. On eBay, we could see the full telephone number, bank details, and personal information, as well as all previous orders. The participant found this very unsettling.

In the Amazon account, we saw the full telephone number, personal details, and partial bank details, along with all previous orders. In the national automobile club account, we obtained the date of birth, telephone number, full name, and address of the participant and family members, vehicle information, and full bank and credit card details.

The participant updated the email addresses in the tested accounts and planned to re-register the old Yahoo email address to prevent future attacks.

### User Case Study #2
The participant had a Yahoo account until autumn 2016, which they deleted following media reports. No further details were provided.

### User Case Study #3
The participant had a Hotmail address that expired due to inactivity. This email address appeared in at least two database leaks: the Adobe leak and the Dropbox leak. We gained access to the Adobe and Dropbox accounts through the password reset function, accessing personal information and files. For the Amazon account, we used a one-time login code, which we found to be particularly dangerous. We recommended the participant review and update all accounts.

### User Case Study #4
The participant had a Hotmail address that likely expired in 2011 due to inactivity. The email address appeared in the Myspace leak and the Exploit.in combination list. We gained access to the participant's active Facebook account through the password reset function. We advised the participant to change the reference from the expired email address to a new one and to review all accounts.

### User Case Study #5
The participant had a GMX address that expired due to inactivity. The email address was referenced in the Amazon account. By guessing the postal code, we took over the Amazon account. We recommended the participant review and update all accounts.

### User Case Study #6
The participant had a GMX address that expired due to inactivity. The email address appeared in several database leaks, including two commercial gaming platform accounts. We recovered access to both gaming platform accounts, gaining personal information. We advised the participant to review and update all accounts.
