## Equipment and Protocols
- **Equipment:**
  - Selfsat H30D (~$90)
  - TBS-6983/6903 (~$200-300)
- **Protocols:**
  - **MPEG-TS + MPE/ULE:**
    - Legacy but still popular standard
    - Combination of protocols for other purposes
    - Tools: dvbsnoop, tsduck, TSReader
    - Primary focus for related work from 2000-2010
  - **GSE (Generic Stream Encapsulation):**
    - More modern, popular among enterprise “VSAT” customers
    - Networks assume equipment in the $25k-$100k range
    - Does not work well on our hardware

## GSExtract
- **Custom Tool:**
  - Forensically reconstructs bad recordings
  - Applies simple rules to find IP headers and place fragments

## General Findings
- **No Default Encryption**
- **ISP-Esque Vantage Point**
- **Breach the Perimeter**

## Terrestrial and TLS
- **TLS == Privacy?**
- **TLS != Privacy:**
  - Top SSL Certificate Names (MPEG-TS Case Study)

## IoT and Critical Infrastructure
- **Example:** "admin-electro....."

## Maritime
- **Case Study: 100 Random Ships**
  - Art: Rodney’s Fleet Taking in Prizes After the Moonlight Battle, Dominic Serres, Public Domain
  - **Findings:**
    - ~10% of vessels identified
    - ECDIS (Electronic Chart Display and Information System):
      - Standard formats support cryptographic verification
      - Observed more than 15,000 unsigned chart files in transit
      - Many use proprietary formats
    - Listening can be enough:
      - Publicly routable FTP fileshares
      - Chart updates via email
    - General privacy issues:
      - Captain of billionaire’s yacht – MSFT account
      - Guests and crew/lunch orders
      - POS traffic from cruise ships
      - Crew passport data transmitted to port authorities

## Aviation

  - **Crossing the “Red Line”:**
    - Sharing of SATCOM devices between different data domains
    - Potential pivot from compromised IFE to avionics

  - **GSM @ 30,000ft:**
    - Active attacks?

## Active Attacks
- **Untraceable Exfiltration Requirements:**
  - Route from compromised host to satellite IP
  - Dish inside forward link footprint
- **TCP Session Hijacking:**
  - Snoop TCP sequence numbers
  - Impersonate satellite-terminal conversation endpoint
  - Network requirements:
    - IPs must be routable to attacker
    - No TCP sequence number altering proxies

## Ethics and Disclosure
- **Adhered to Legal Obligations:**
  - Data stored securely and only while needed
  - Data never shared with third parties
  - Encryption untouched
  - No “name and shame”
- **Responsible Disclosure:**
  - Contacted satellite operators in 2019
  - Reached out to some of the largest impacted customers
  - Most companies were receptive
  - Shared findings directly with CISOs of several large organizations
  - Only one organization threatened legal action if published

## Thanks FBI!

## Mitigations and Defenses
- **Why This Happens:**
  - Not just ignorance or incompetence
  - Long round-trip times (RTT) to GEO
  - TCP is especially troublesome due to the 3-way handshake
- **Your ISP: A Helpful MITM?**
  - Split TCP handshake locally
  - One handshake at the modem, one at the ISP ground station
  - Problem: Can’t split TCP connections if wrapped in a VPN
  - Basic Performance Enhancing Proxy (PEP)

## Immediate Actions
- **Accept VPN performance hit**
- **Use TLS, DNSSEC, etc.**
- **ISP: Alter sequence numbers in PEP**

## Longer Term: QPEP
- **Design Principles:**
  - Open source
  - Accessible and simple
  - Target individuals (not ISPs)
  - [Contribute Here](https://github.com/ssloxford/qpep)
- **Performance Comparison:**
  - Traditional VPN Encryption (OpenVPN): ~25 seconds
  - Encrypted PEP (QPEP): ~14 seconds

## Key Takeaways
- **Satellite broadband traffic is vulnerable to long-range eavesdropping attacks.**
- **Satellite customers across domains leak sensitive data over satellite links.**
- **Performance and privacy don’t need to trade off in SATCOM design.**
- **The “Next Hop” is unknown. Encrypt everything.**
