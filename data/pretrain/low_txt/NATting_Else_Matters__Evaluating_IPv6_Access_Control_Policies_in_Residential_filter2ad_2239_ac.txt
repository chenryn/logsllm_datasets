### Longer Protection and Firewall Anomalies

It is unclear whether the observed behavior is due to an oversight or intended operation. Our analysis uncovered two notable exceptions: 

1. **Motorola MR2600**: This router maintains a small subset of exposed open ports on its external interface, even when the firewall is enabled.
2. **TP-Link AC1750**: Despite the public availability of a CVE (CVE-2016-7406) describing a remote code execution vulnerability, this router continues to use an outdated version of Dropbear SSH.

Interestingly, among the routers that expose ports in any firewall configuration, there appears to be a common set of open ports that do not provide a banner. We hypothesize that these ports are associated with common services that each router provides but does not enable by default. For example, multiple routers advertise the ability to set up local storage sharing, likely using SMB on port 445. Although we did not test this functionality, the exposure of these ports suggests that if a client were to enable these features, they would also be accessible to the wider Internet over IPv6. The unique combination of default states and available services provides enough distinctive scan data to individually identify the device manufacturer; six out of the ten routers we examined have uniquely identifiable features. As a result, we believe it may be possible to fingerprint routers through probing open IPv6 ports and services, though we leave this to future work.

### Externally Exposed Services

The following table lists the IPv6 services and open TCP ports that are exposed by each device, with the firewall either enabled or disabled for those routers that support such an option. Ports in bold indicate that a service responded with a banner. The services are documented based on the address from the router’s external interface. Most routers have a separate address assigned to their internal interface from their allocated subnet, though we find that the exposed services are typically the same between the two.

### Summary and Implications

Our findings indicate a lack of standardization among the evaluated routers regarding the security and operational functionality provided for IPv6 CE networks. This is in stark contrast to IPv4, where devices and services are not exposed. While NAT was not designed as a security framework, the deny-all, permit-by-exception ingress policy serves as an invariant for consumer routing devices and is noted as such within RFCs [3, 16, 20]. The inconsistency in device implementations and the default policies maintained by devices put real users and systems at risk.

### Discussion

The CE environment presents a unique challenge in balancing device capability against user ability and need. This work demonstrates that the shift to IPv6 removes the consistency of one of its most crucial layers of defense: homogeneity in router operation. Without a safe default policy, consumers must rely on the security of each of their endpoint devices, which can be difficult to ensure, especially in CE environments where device maintenance is not guaranteed. We recognize that many of these problems are not caused by or unique to IPv6 consumer networks, but unclear IPv6 implementation strategies exacerbate these issues by offloading responsibility for securing and configuring the network to consumers.

In our assessment, we observe a struggle to define the right amount of control without under-offering or overwhelming targeted consumer demographics. This has left router manufacturers to determine the correct abstractions and implementations and how to communicate these clearly to a wide demographic of users. Addressing the general inconsistency is the most direct path to securing CE networks in IPv6.

### Recommendations

There are multiple parties involved in CE environments, each with different motivations and risk factors. It is essential that the design of CE networks prioritizes the wholesale security of consumer data and devices. We structure our recommendations around the following principles:

- **Secure Default Operation**: The default operation mode should be secure, and the bulk of network configuration should be moved from consumers to developers.
- **Consistent Configuration Options**: Configuration options should be consistent and only as permissive as necessary.
- **Confirmation Warnings**: Configuration pitfalls should have confirmation warnings that ensure users understand the risks associated with the changes they are making (e.g., making devices globally accessible).
- **Standardized Documentation**: Documentation should share abstractions and language across manufacturers and be as minimally complex as feasible.

It is important to present a clear, consistent threat model to consumers whose ability and understanding often lag behind that of developers, to avoid oversight on responsibility for securing devices connected to home networks. This is the responsibility of both standardization bodies and the CE router industry as a whole. We strongly recommend the following defaults:

- **Standardization**: CE routers should universally standardize around a default ingress filtering policy that denies incoming traffic. Manufacturers should remove or restrict the "one-click open" option on CE routers, as home users are likely to unknowingly expose their entire network, violating the security principle of least privilege. If this is a required functionality, routers should warn users and/or suggest using IPv6 pinholing before allowing them to use this option.
- **Manual Exceptions**: For manual exceptions, manufacturers should implement both device and IP-based rules and develop a consistent vocabulary for describing them. Providing users with the resources to understand when each option is preferable will require that the language used to describe IPv6 configuration options is consistent across manufacturers.
- **Documentation**: It is irrelevant what standards require if manufacturers ignore them or if parties involved fail to understand their importance or the importance of their abstractions. Fostering consumer and developer understanding of IPv6 security can create pressure on manufacturers to adhere to standards and promote transparency ahead of purchase. Establishing consistent language and abstractions for describing the security mechanisms of IPv6 networks is the first step.

Currently, manufacturers of customer edge routers highlight IPv6 as an enhanced feature in their product marketing, but we found no instance of educating users about IPv6 or describing its security implications. Instead, phrases such as "provides infinite addresses for more devices," "best possible experience," and "simplifies the router's tasks" are offered as slogans to encourage user commitment [11, 12]. These approaches are problematic, as they hide a transparent shift in the security model of home networks that consumers cannot be expected to inherently understand on their own.

Morgner et al. present one possible solution of offering device label standards similar to nutrition labels on food [14]. Here, the authors focused on manufacturer guarantees for the duration of product support and timeliness of updates in a standardized label. We argue for taking this concept further with a holistic approach to additional aspects of security, such as default configuration, control mechanisms, and third-party certifications. Requirements for labeling standards incentivize manufacturers to provide and document security features necessary for consumers to have a functional understanding of their network posture at purchase.

### Future Work

While this work discusses the "One-Click Open" option, we have not conducted a formal user experience study to confirm that users will rely on this option to achieve simple routing changes in their IPv6 networks as a first choice. A proper study of the UX/UI design involved in home network security would be informative and could provide developers with a better understanding of consumer needs and approaches to IPv6 security.

Although we use this work to gauge the scope of current security policies of IPv6 CE routers, a large-scale examination of router IPv6 firewall behavior is required to better understand the breadth of the impact that the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 has on CE routing. Specifically, a tool assisting clients to better understand the defaults that their network implements could prove a strong contribution towards this result. Similar large-scale studies of IoT and smart devices operating in IPv6 environments are reserved for future efforts as well.

### Conclusion

In IPv4 networks, the use of NAT afforded a ubiquitous, de facto default-deny security posture. The growing deployment of IPv6, which eliminates address scarcity, no longer requires NAT. In the absence of strong guidance for how router manufacturers should implement filtering, we examined a diverse set of routers to measure real-world implementations. We find that the access control models and controls implemented to manage these networks are coarse and contain unsafe defaults that likely expose devices on the network—often without warning to the consumer. The result is a systemic, demonstrable failure among all parties to agree upon, implement, and communicate consistent security policies. While IPv6 brings important advances to the Internet, significant effort by academia and industry is needed to help address and solve access control issues in the home, including adequately communicating information about these postures to consumers.
