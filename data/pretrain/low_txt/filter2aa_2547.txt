## August Smart Lock
### Marketing Claims
- **August's Marketing Team** (Source: august.com, August 17th, 2015)
  - "Unlike physical keys, which can be duplicated and distributed without your knowledge, an August lock..."
- **Additional Claim** (Source: august.com, September 14th, 2015)
  - "Safer than... codes that can be copied."

### Security Claims
- **Perfectly secure**
- **Guest access can be revoked at any time**
- **Guest permission can be limited to a schedule**
- **Guests cannot:**
  - Use auto-unlock
  - Invite or remove guests or owners
  - View activity feed
  - View guest list
  - Change lock settings
- **Keys cannot be duplicated or distributed**

## Mapping Out the API
### Communication Protocols
- **WiFi/HTTPS**
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Proxy**
- **Certificate Pinning**

### Initial Solution
1. **Use iOS SSL Kill Switch** (https://github.com/iSECPartners/ios-ssl-kill-switch)
   - Disables SSL/TLS system-wide at Defcon

### Better Solution
- **No Jailbreak Required**
- **Certificate Pinned**

### Postman Collection
- Created a Postman collection (see GitHub repository)
- **Note**: Not anonymized, potentially creepy

### Mitigation
- **MitM Can Modify Traffic**
- **Fix**: Do not forward log data to August, and tell the app logs were received

### User Types
- **Guest**: Regular user
- **Owner**: Superuser
- **Exploit**: Replace "user" with "superuser" to allow guests to change lock settings

### BLE API
- **WiFi/HTTPS**
- **BLE**
- **Enumerate BLE Services**
- **Intercepting BLE Traffic**
  - **Solution**: Ubertooth
  - **Better Solution**: Tap and Replace
  - **Plaintext BLE traffic in log files!**

### Lock Security Model
- **BLE + Just Works Pairing**
- **256 Offline Key Slots (0-255)**
- **AES-128-CBC (null IV)**
- **Key Slot 0 is Special**

### Requesting Firmware as a Guest
- **Weird Behavior**: Repeated hash values
- **Firmware Key 'Cannot' Be Changed**
- **Key Material in Logs**

### Security Claims (Revisited)
- **Perfectly secure**
- **Guest access can be revoked at any time**
- **Guest permission can be limited to a schedule**
- **Guests cannot:**
  - Use auto-unlock
  - Invite or remove guests or owners
  - View activity feed
  - View guest list
  - Change lock settings
- **Keys cannot be duplicated or distributed**

### Best Practice
- **Do Not Give Guest Access to Someone You Would Not Give a Key To**

### Code on GitHub
- **SDK for August Lock**
- **Postman Collection**

### Demo
1. **Unlock Without a Trace**
2. **Change Settings**
3. **Backdooring a Lock**

### Mistakes Made
- **Mobile App Logs Include Key Material**
- **Lock Does Not Differentiate Between Guest and Owner**
- **Firmware Not Signed**
- **No Apparent Way to Discover Backdoor Keys**
- **Guest Users Can Download Key Material**
- **Access Entry Log Can Be Erased by Guest Users**
- **Confusing Two-Factor with Two-Step Authentication**
- **No Rate Limiting of Password Reset Attempts (Fixed)**
- **Mobile Apps Include Bypass for Certificate Pinning**
- **SecureRandom Not Used for Nonce or Session Key Generation (Fixed)**
- **Key Material Not Stored on iOS Keychain**

### What Was Done Correctly
- **Mobile Apps Attempt to Use Certificate Pinning**
- **Protocol Makes Use of Nonces and CBC**
- **August Has Been Very Responsive**
- **Not Relying Solely on BLE's Just Works Security Model**

### Conclusion
- **Hackers Needed**: Consumers are not able to evaluate security claims made by companies.
- **More Researchers Needed**: Investigate security claims made by companies on behalf of consumers.
- **Assertion Without Evidence**: Can be dismissed without evidence.
