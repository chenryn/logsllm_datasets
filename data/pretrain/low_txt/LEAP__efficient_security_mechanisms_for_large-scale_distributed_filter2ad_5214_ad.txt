### Security Implications and Defense Mechanisms in Sensor Networks

#### 1. General Adversary Capabilities Post-Compromise

When an adversary compromises a sensor node, several potential attack vectors emerge. We will first examine the general capabilities of an adversary post-compromise and then delve into specific attacks on routing protocols in Section 5.2.

**Key Compromise Scenarios:**

1. **Individual Node Key:**
   - The individual key of a node is shared only between the node and the base station. Obtaining this key does not typically aid the adversary in launching broader attacks, as it is not used for inter-node communication.

2. **Pairwise and Cluster Keys:**
   - Possession of pairwise shared keys and cluster keys allows the adversary to establish trust with neighboring nodes. This can enable the injection of malicious routing control information or erroneous sensor readings into the network.
   - In our scheme, the adversary must use the identity of the compromised node to launch such attacks due to our inter-node authentication mechanism. A key feature of our protocol is its ability to localize damage. After a node joins the network, it maintains a list of trusted neighboring nodes. Thus, the compromised node can only establish trust with its immediate neighbors, limiting the impact on other secure links.

3. **Group Key:**
   - Possessing the group key allows the adversary to decrypt messages broadcast by the base station. Since broadcast messages are intended to be known by all nodes, compromising one node is sufficient to reveal the message, regardless of the security mechanisms in place.
   - However, possessing the group key does not enable the adversary to flood the entire network with malicious packets impersonating the base station, as messages sent by the base station are authenticated using µTESLA. Additionally, our periodic group rekeying scheme ensures that the adversary can only decrypt messages encrypted with the current group key.

#### 2. Defending Against Attacks on Secure Routing

Karlof and Wagner [17] have extensively studied possible attacks on routing protocols in wireless sensor networks. Below, we discuss how our schemes can defend against these attacks.

**Outsider Attacks:**
- Our inter-node authentication scheme prevents most outsider attacks, except for the wormhole attack (discussed in Section 5.2.1). Therefore, we focus on insider attacks where the adversary has compromised one or more sensor nodes.

**Insider Attacks:**
- An insider adversary may attempt to spoof, alter, or replay routing information to create routing loops, manipulate network traffic, or generate false error messages. They may also launch a Selective Forwarding attack, where the compromised node suppresses packets from specific nodes while forwarding others.
- While our scheme cannot prevent the launch of these attacks, it can minimize their consequences:
  - **Localized Impact:** Our inter-node authentication scheme limits the scope of these attacks to a two-hop zone around the compromised node.
  - **Detection Risk:** The localized nature of the attacks increases the likelihood of detection. For example, our probabilistic challenge scheme makes spoofing difficult to go undetected, and altering attacks can be detected when the sending node overhears its message being altered.
  - **Efficient Revocation:** Once a compromised node is detected, our group rekeying scheme can efficiently revoke the node from the network.

**Preventable Attacks:**
- **HELLO Flood Attack:** The adversary sends HELLO messages to all nodes, convincing them that it is a neighbor. This attack fails in our scheme because the adversary lacks a network-wide authentication key.
- **Sybil Attack:** The adversary replicates the compromised node and adds multiple replicas to the network. This attack is thwarted in our scheme because each node knows its neighbors, and we do not use the base station for pairwise key establishment.

#### 3. Dealing with Wormhole and Sinkhole Attacks

The most challenging attacks to detect or prevent are those that combine sinkhole and wormhole techniques.

**Sinkhole Attack:**
- A compromised node advertises high remaining energy or end-to-end reliability to attract and drop packets from its neighbors. This information is hard to verify.

**Wormhole Attack:**
- Two distant malicious nodes collude to understate their distance, creating a shortcut that appears to be a single or two-hop path. This can mislead nodes near the target into thinking they are closer to the base station than they actually are.
- The wormhole attack is powerful because it does not require the compromise of any sensor nodes. Hu, Perrig, and Johnson [11] propose two detection schemes for ad hoc networks, but these are not feasible for most sensor networks.

**Defense Mechanisms:**
- **Neighbor Discovery Phase:** An outsider adversary can only launch a wormhole attack during the neighbor discovery phase of the pairwise key establishment process. After this phase, nodes know their neighbors, making it impossible for the adversary to convince distant nodes that they are neighbors.
- **Authenticated Neighbor Knowledge:** The authenticated and initial neighborhood knowledge is critical in defending against wormhole attacks.
- **Insider Adversary:** An insider adversary must compromise at least two sensor nodes to create a wormhole. Even then, they cannot convince distant nodes that they are neighbors after the neighbor discovery phase. If one compromised node is close to the base station and another is in the area of interest, it may create a sinkhole, but this is detectable if the base station's location is static and nodes know the approximate number of hops to the base station.

Stajano and Anderson [23] discuss security issues for "peanut nodes" and propose bootstrapping trust through physical contact. Zhu et al. [28] present an efficient scheme for bootstrapping trust among mobile nodes using TESLA [21] and one-way hash chains. Carman, Kruus, and Matt [5] analyze key management and distribution in sensor networks, focusing on energy consumption. Basagni et al. [2] discuss a rekeying scheme for updating group-wide traffic encryption keys, assuming tamper-free nodes. Eschenauer and Gligor [9] and Chan et al. [6] present key management schemes based on probabilistic key predeployment. Zhu et al. [29] propose a method for establishing pairwise keys with overwhelming probability. These schemes provide probabilistic security, whereas our scheme offers deterministic security.

Perrig et al. [22] present SNEP and µTESLA for data confidentiality and authentication, but their scheme uses the base station for pairwise key establishment, which limits scalability and makes it vulnerable to Sybil attacks. Liu and Ning [19] present a multi-level key chain scheme for µTESLA. Karlof et al. [16] describe TinySec, a link layer security mechanism, and discuss the impact of different keying mechanisms on in-network processing. Karlof and Wagner [17] discuss security attacks on routing protocols, and our scheme can prevent or thwart many of these attacks efficiently.

### 7. Conclusions

In this paper, we present LEAP (Localized Encryption and Authentication Protocol), a key management protocol for sensor networks. LEAP supports four types of keys per sensor node: individual keys shared with the base station, pairwise keys with neighboring nodes, cluster keys with a set of neighbors, and a group key shared with all nodes. It includes an efficient inter-node traffic authentication protocol based on one-way key chains. LEAP's key sharing approach supports in-network processing while localizing the security impact of a node compromise. The key establishment and updating procedures are efficient, and storage requirements per node are minimal. LEAP can prevent or increase the difficulty of launching many security attacks on sensor networks.
