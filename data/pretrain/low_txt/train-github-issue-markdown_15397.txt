The new `scipy.spatial` package integrates my distance computation code with Anne Archibald's kd-tree module. To fully leverage this integration, some minor reworking is required to enable the kd-tree code to utilize the distance functions provided by the distance module. This consolidation will reduce functional redundancy within SciPy and enhance the overall maintainability of the codebase.
