It appears that what you are experiencing may not be a bug, but rather a feature of the system. When searching for logs in the dashboard on App Engine, I encounter an issue with viewing expanded logs. The search results display the first few log entries in full detail, while the remaining entries are partially obscured. Over time, newer log entries continue to be shown in full detail, but older ones become increasingly obscured.

This same behavior is observed when attempting to download logs from App Engine, although more log entries remain unobscured in this case.

The challenge here is that I am unable to obtain a complete, detailed log of my application, which hinders my ability to perform certain tasks over the data.

**Explanation:**
App Engine stores logging information in a set of circular buffers. Once these buffers run out of space, older log entries are overwritten by new data. What you are seeing is a result of the detailed logs for older requests being overwritten by newer ones. This is a standard behavior designed to manage storage efficiently, but it can make it difficult to access a complete, detailed log history.
