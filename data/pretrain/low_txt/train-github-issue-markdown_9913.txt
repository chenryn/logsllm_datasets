# Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

The Product Launcher should support keyboard layout mapping for all system keyboard layouts. This feature is necessary even for languages that do not require switching between different keyboard layouts.

### Examples:
- A query of **"ьшскщыщае еуфьы"** should display results for both **"ьшскщыщае еуфьы"** and **"microsoft teams"**.
- A query of **"rfkmrekznjh"** should display results for both **"калькулятор"** and **"rfkmrekznjh"**.

### Additional Requirements:
- The Product Launcher should also search for localized app names (e.g., `ms-resource:AppName`) similar to how Windows Search operates.
