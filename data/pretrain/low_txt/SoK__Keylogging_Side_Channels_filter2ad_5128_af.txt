### VI. DISCUSSION

Keylogging side-channel attacks, as summarized in Table II, have a history spanning nearly two decades, with roots tracing back to the end of World War II [2]. These attacks appear to have advanced significantly during the Cold War era, as evidenced by incidents such as the Selectric Bug [1]. In contrast, the body of research on keylogging side-channel defenses (Table III) is much smaller, and none of the proposed countermeasures have been widely adopted. However, this may change in the near future, as recent studies have introduced low-cost countermeasures that are effective against both host-based and network-based attacks [10], [89].

It is important to note that keylogging attacks exploiting device behavior, such as electromagnetic (EM) emanations and cache usage, generally achieve higher performance than those targeting human behavior, like smartwatch motion and packet timing. This disparity can be attributed to the greater regularity and consistency of device behavior compared to human behavior. An attack that exploits microarchitectural side effects is likely to work across all devices of the same make and model due to the highly consistent behavior across these devices. Conversely, an attack that targets human behavior must adapt to changes over time and between users, making it less reliable.

These observations suggest a fundamental relationship between behavior homogeneity and attack severity in the context of side channels. Users and devices that exhibit behavior contrary to the norm may be less susceptible to such attacks. However, deviating from the norm could also compromise anonymity, enabling behavior-based identification, an issue not addressed in this work.

Temporal keylogging side channels exploit a well-established phenomenon in transcription typing: different users tend to operate keyboards within similar time constraints. This allows an adversary to make general inferences about user actions based on temporal behavior. For touch typists, shorter time intervals typically correspond to keys that are far apart, while longer intervals are associated with keys that are close together. This is due to the need to reuse the same finger or hand for neighboring keys, while distant keys are pressed more quickly through parallel processing by alternate fingers [43]. Consistent with this, our findings in Section III-C3 indicate that faster touch typists are more vulnerable to temporal attacks. This dichotomy in performance is reminiscent of the biometric menagerie, which suggests that biometric identification systems work well for some users (sheep) but are problematic for others (goats) [94]. Understanding the specific factors that influence temporal information gain could lead to the development of new and effective countermeasures.

Consistency in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) behavior is not limited to typing. The presence of temporal keylogging side channels reflects a broader problem potentially faced by interactive client-server applications. Similar phenomena exist in other modalities, such as Fitts' Law for mouse pointer navigation on computer screens [95] and Finger-Fitts' (FFitts) Law for touch screen behavior [96]. This raises the question of what other HCI modalities are subject to such attacks and what defenses must be deployed to mitigate this class of human-based timing side channels. Given the proliferation of real-time client-server applications, where human input events must propagate to the network layer, further investigation into this issue is warranted.

### VII. CONCLUSION

The keyboard remains a ubiquitous device in human-computer interaction, even with the availability of alternatives like voice and eye movement. Its continued use is likely due to familiarity, speed, and the relative accuracy it offers. Keylogging side channels will likely remain just as prevalent due to the increasing complexity and sensing capabilities of computing devices. Physiological signals [48] and microarchitectural side effects have proven to be particularly pervasive [93], with recent attacks highlighting the numerous ways to eavesdrop on keyboard input. User actions captured through the keyboard and other peripheral devices permeate network communication channels and can have unforeseen side effects on the device. The difficulty in mitigating these types of attacks underscores the importance of empirical studies to evaluate device security [92] and calls for a deeper understanding of the security and privacy implications in human-computer interaction.
