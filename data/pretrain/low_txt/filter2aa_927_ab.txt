### RAR Software Discrepancy
- A one-byte discrepancy was identified in the RAR software compared to the original version.
- The same file was discovered on multiple machines, suggesting its use in previous attacks.
- Inserting malware in locations where legitimate software is stored appears to be a characteristic tactic of Operation Chimera.

### Root Cause Analysis – IP1
- **IP1** is an unscanned host associated with numerous accounts, potentially indicating it is a shared machine or a VPN host.
- It is important to note that even a VPN can be compromised. Therefore, it should not be relied upon as the sole line of defense.

### B Company: Investigation Overview
- **Investigation Reason**: C company detected anomalous activities from B company and requested an investigation.
- **Business Cooperation**: B and C companies have a business relationship, creating a network bridge between them.

### Statistical Summary
- **Time Period**: 2018/8/7 - 2019/12/11
- **Number of Events**: 140,000+
- **Compromised Endpoints**: 14
- **Data Leaks**: 9
- **Malware Instances**: 10

### PowerShell Malware
- **Fileless Malware**: 
  - Affected 10 endpoints, including two domain controllers.
  - The PowerShell script executed a Cobalt Strike backdoor and was used for process migration to system processes like `svchost.exe`.
  - Example command: `powershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand <base64_encoded_command>`

### APT Attack
- **Cobalt Strike**: Used to inject malware into the system, allowing the attacker to access and communicate with Command and Control (C2) servers.
- **C2 Servers**:
  - `striking-pipe-253603.appspot.com`
  - `msplatform-updates.azureedge.net`
  - `chrome-applatses.appspot.com`

### Cyber Situation Graph
- **Hacker Activity**:
  - The hacker returned on a quarterly basis to collect new data.
  - **Key Dates**:
    - November 2018
    - March 2019
    - June 2019
    - September 2019
    - November 2019: Deployed a new weapon, SkeletonKey Injector
    - December 2019: Harvested new endpoints

### Archive Password
- **RAR Program**: The attacker used a RAR program with innocuous file names such as `RecordedTV.ms`, `jucheck.exe`, and `vmware.log` to archive and steal data.
- **Password Archiving**: A similar scheme was used to archive the passwords they utilized.
- **Example Commands**:
  - `c:\users\xxxx\libraries\RecordedTV.ms a -m5 -v71m –hpf**kyou.google.com11 vmlum-vss.log vmlum-vmvss.log`
  - `C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C c:\users\xxxxxx\libraries\RecordedTV.ms a -m5 -r –hpf**kyou.google.com11 vmlum-vmopt.log “\\\personal\\-Traning-v1.1.pptx" > vmlumss.log & dir vmlum-vmopt*`

### Leaked File Names
- **Leaked Data Inventory**:
  - `\Users\Project\Roadmap`
  - `\Users\Backup\Workspace`
  - `\Users\chip and SDK setting`
  - `\Users\SDK Installation guide.pdf`
- **Attacker's Intent**: Stealing intellectual property, possibly for business espionage or state-sponsored attacks.

### Actors' Digital Arsenal
- **Tools Used**:
  - Cobalt Strike Beacon
  - WinRAR
  - SkeletonKey Injector
  - Winnti Backdoor

### Cobalt Strike Beacon
- **Main Backdoor**: Overwrote `GoogleUpdate.exe` for persistence.
- **Identical File**: Found in three or more companies.
- **C2 Servers**:
  - `chrome-applatnohp.appspot.com`
  - `ussdns04.heketwe.com`
  - `ussdns02.heketwe.com`
  - `ussdns01.heketwe.com`

### Suspicious R-W-X Memory
- **Detection**: Our product detected suspicious memory blocks.

### Hybrid Payload: PE as Shellcode
- **Signature Decoding**:
  - "MZ" signature decodes to "pop r10" under x64 architecture.
  - "dec ebp; pop edx" under x86 architecture.
- **Shellcode Function**: At offset 0x1791c, a shellcode-like function called "reflective loader" is present.
- **Hash Value**: 0x56A2B5F0 is the hash value of "ExitProcess".

### Malicious Process Injection Strategy
- **Named Pipe**: Used by Cobalt Strike Beacon to inject the real payload into the target process.

### WinRAR
- **Compression and Encryption**: The attackers used `rar.exe` to compress and encrypt files.
- **Folder Name**: `RecordedTV.library-ms` was found in the same path.

### Mutated rar.exe
- **File Upload**: The file was uploaded to VirusTotal in 2009.
- **Version**: It is `rar.exe` from WinRAR 3.60b8 but differs by one byte from the original.
- **Hypotheses**:
  - Change file hash to avoid detection.
  - Bit flip during copy.
- **Patch Diff** and **Disassembly** provided for further analysis.

### SkeletonKey Injector
- **New Malware**: Combines "dumpert" and "mimikatz".
- **Mimikatz**: A well-known hacking tool often used to dump Windows credentials.
- **Dumpert**: Developed by Outflank, it stealthily dumps `lsass.exe` memory using direct system calls.

### SkeletonKey
- **APT Malware**: Discovered by DELL Secureworks in 2015.
- **Backdoor Password**: Implants a backdoor password into the domain controller.
- **Impact**:
  - No need for administrator credentials for lateral movement.
  - Leaves minimal traces, only logon success events.
  - Rebooting the domain controller is required to remove the SkeletonKey.

### Winnti Backdoor
- **BaseClient.exe**: Initially thought to be a network probing tool, it was actually a Winnti backdoor.

### Other APT Events in Taiwan
- **ColdLock Ransomware**: Targeted Taiwan's national gasoline company, based on open-source ransomware EDA2.
- **Ministry of Justice**: Linked the attack to the Winnti group.
- **SkeletonKey Attacks**: Several attacks against Taiwan government agencies used modified versions of mimikatz.

### Key Takeaways
- **Large-Scale APT Attacks**: Targeted semiconductor vendors, their subsidiaries, partners, and competitors.
- **Goals**: Stealing intellectual property, causing long-term damage.
- **Attribution**: Attackers use various open-source and general tools to make attribution difficult.
- **AD & VPN Compromise**: Enterprises should consider the resilience of IT systems and avoid relying on a single security service.
- **Persistence and Defense Evasion**: Use of the SkeletonKey technique allows adversaries to log in like normal users.
- **Regular Threat Hunting**: Shorten Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR).
