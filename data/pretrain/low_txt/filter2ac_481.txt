**Title: BotConf 2019 - "DESKTOP-Group": Tracking a Persistent Threat Group Using Email Headers**

At BotConf 2015, I delivered a lightning talk titled "Creating Your Own CTI in 3 Minutes." Building on that foundation, this presentation will explore the use of a commercial sandbox solution for semi-automated malware analysis. I will delve into an in-depth analysis of a malware campaign conducted by a persistent threat actor (or group) over the past 18 months, which is still ongoing. The attacks are linked through common email headers, targeting patterns, and the malware's command and control (C&C) infrastructure.
