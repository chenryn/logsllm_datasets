### Current Behavior

The `<script>` and `<style>` tags are being stripped from templates, but they are still listed in the DOM element registry as supported, complete with their respective DOM properties. This can be seen in the following file:
- [DOM Element Schema Registry](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/compiler/src/schema/dom_element_schema_registry.ts)

### Expected/Desired Behavior

These tags should be removed from the registry. Ideally, they should be marked as forbidden in the registry to clearly indicate that they do not fall into the 'unknown' tag category.

### Angular Version

- **Repository:** GitHub
- **Branch:** Master
