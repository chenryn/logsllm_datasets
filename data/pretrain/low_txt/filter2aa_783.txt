- **Compulsory Process:**
  - "We have opened a law enforcement investigation. Please provide documents responsive to the following questions…."
  - The term "documents" includes all written, recorded, and graphic materials, as well as electronic data, including emails, drafts, metadata, and historical data. Documents must be produced in electronic form, including from personal computers, portable devices, servers, and backup storage.

### Best Practices
- **Do Not Ignore Requests:**
  - Review carefully.
  - Assign the best possible person in the company for each question.
  - Engage an outsider if necessary.
  - Determine where and in what form the documents are stored.
  - Contact the requesting attorney to discuss any issues with the terms of the letter.

- **Government Staff Considerations:**
  - Government staff may not have technical knowledge.
  - Protect yourself by addressing unclear or incorrect questions.
  - Negotiate the breadth of the request, including the time period.
  - Consider ongoing/rolling production.
  - Distinguish between originals and copies, hard copies and electronic versions.
  - Establish a Bates stamping procedure.
  - Be willing to meet with government staff to add context and clarification.
  - Produce documents in a usable and useful form.
  - Request confidential treatment.
  - Cooperate but do not be a doormat.
  - Cooperation can resolve issues without further action and lessen burdens if the case proceeds.

### Civil Investigative Demand (CID) or Subpoena
- **Compulsory Process:**
  - Provide documents.
  - Interrogatories: Provide written answers to questions.
  - Depositions: Provide someone to testify under oath.
  - Sanctions for non-compliance.

- **Review and Response:**
  - Review carefully.
  - Assign the best possible person for each question or topic specified in the deposition notice.
  - Contact the requesting attorney to discuss any issues.
  - Negotiate the breadth of the request.
  - Consider ongoing/rolling production.
  - Distinguish between originals and copies, hard copies and electronic versions.
  - Establish a Bates stamping procedure.
  - Answer interrogatories clearly and completely.
  - Provide truly qualified people for depositions.
  - Stakes are higher: Civil penalties include financial and injunctive measures, and criminal actions may result in jail time.
  - The 5th Amendment applies.
  - The atmosphere is more adversarial, but cooperation is still possible.

### Grand Jury Subpoena vs. Search Warrant
- **Control Over Records:**
  - Determine whether the government or the company should control the collection of records.
  - Consider whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that evidence may be destroyed, altered, or removed.
  - Address constitutional questions.
  - Provide grand jury testimony if applicable.
  - Seek a protective order if the search is overbroad.
  - Negotiate handling of potentially privileged materials.
  - Follow similar procedures and strategies.
  - Less need for confrontation.
  - Some material may be on public record; point to it to help law enforcement and lessen your burdens.

### Third-Party Involvement
- **Consultation with Counsel:**
  - Consult with counsel before taking any action.
  - Less likely in security cases than in other cybercrimes, but if stolen data or a cyber threat puts individuals at risk, take appropriate action.
  - Have terms of service that keep the need for document production in mind.
  - Publicize security activities.
  - Build relationships over time through meetings, conventions, and groups such as Infragard.
  - Law enforcement is more accessible and receptive if you have a good relationship.
  - You know the law enforcement organization, and they know you.
