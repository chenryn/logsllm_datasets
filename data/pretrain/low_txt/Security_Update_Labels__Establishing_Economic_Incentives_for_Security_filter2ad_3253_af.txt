# Energy Labeling Rule and Related Policies

**Energy Labeling Rule (2018)**

- **Policy Overview**: The Energy Labeling Rule, established in 2018, is a regulatory framework that mandates the display of energy efficiency information on certain products. This policy aims to help consumers make informed decisions by providing clear and standardized information about the energy consumption and environmental impact of various products.

## International Standards for Security and Vulnerability Management

### ISO/IEC 29147:2014
- **Title**: Information technology – Security techniques – Vulnerability disclosure
- **Publication Date**: February 2014
- **Description**: This standard provides guidelines for organizations to establish, implement, and maintain a process for disclosing vulnerabilities in information technology systems.

### ISO/IEC 30111:2013
- **Title**: Information technology – Security techniques – Vulnerability handling processes
- **Publication Date**: November 2013
- **Description**: This standard outlines the best practices for managing and handling vulnerabilities in information technology systems, including the identification, assessment, and mitigation of security risks.

## European Union Regulations

### Regulation (EU) 2016/679
- **Title**: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- **Publication Date**: April 2016
- **Description**: The GDPR is a comprehensive data protection regulation that applies to all organizations operating within the EU. It sets out strict rules for the collection, processing, and storage of personal data, with significant penalties for non-compliance.
