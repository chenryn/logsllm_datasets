### MAC Address Synchronization and Tracking

When MAC addresses change synchronously (assuming sufficient group membership), tracking can be achieved. This type of attack requires the collusion of multiple Access Points (APs) and communication mechanisms such as Wi-Fi or equivalent. Setting up such an attack may be impractical for all but the most sophisticated attackers.

### Hybrid Attacks

Several works [20–26] combine WLSS data with motion and inertial sensors to infer user location, mode of transit, orientation, and behavior. Among these, the best-case accuracies are around 80%. Although these mechanisms offer interesting positional accuracy benefits, they generally require obtaining a 'fix' via WLSS functionality before leveraging sensor data, which exposes the attacker to WLSS discovery mechanisms.

Zhang et al. [27] developed the SensTrack system, which uses a smartphone's accelerometer to identify turning points and determine speed, distance, and orientation. They also use adaptive Wi-Fi and GPS switching to address contexts where GPS is less effective, such as indoor locations. Their system achieved prediction errors of approximately 3.128 meters compared to 5 meters for good GPS signal strength. This approach assumes some initial location determination using GPS. Additionally, the short distances within a building do not present the same challenges as those in the spatial-temporal context of driving a vehicle.

### Sensor-Only Attacks

The following attacks rely entirely on zero-permission sensor sources, making them more representative of our approach.

**Han et al. [28]** proposed a method of location inference using the accelerometer and magnetometer. By leveraging a probabilistic dead reckoning method called Probabilistic Inertial Navigation (ProbIN), they mapped the probability of displacement to the probability of motion. Training data associates sensor data with map truth, achieving a resolution approaching 200 meters, the length of a typical city block. The small sample size limited the experimental path length range to between 1 km and 9.7 km. Although they claimed better accuracy than achievable using Wi-Fi or cellular techniques, their approach greatly depends on acquiring training data, which may present resource challenges in large-scale scenarios.

**Nawaz et al. [29]** demonstrated that a smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope can identify significant journeys independent of phone orientation and traffic. Gyroscope signatures from multiple journeys of the same route exhibit similar patterns, differing only in amplitude and time compression or expansion. They applied Dynamic Time Warping to calculate the distance between various journeys and used a k-medoids clustering approach to cluster similar routes. A route is labeled as significant if it is traveled more times than a predefined threshold. They tested this technique for two cities using 43 real driving experiments and showed that the routes were accurately clustered into 8 clusters defined for the two cities. For grid road networks, they used turn count as a uniqueness metric, suggesting that their technique is effective for reasonably long routes because such routes exhibit a unique sequence of turns even when individual turns are similar.

**Zhou et al. [30]** described a novel technique that analyzes verbal directions provided by a GPS-based navigation app. Using a second zero-permissions app, they measured speaker on/off times controlled by the navigation app. The attacker can infer which course a driver took based on the duration of these audible driving instructions. Permission for speaker usage is not required as of this writing. Associating talk time to an off-board synthesized instruction driving set yielded a 30% false positive rate over a small sample size (7 out of 10 correct). This approach requires the use of a voice-enabled navigation system and assumes that the navigation app is trustworthy.

**Michalevsky et al. [10]** introduced a power-based scheme that distinguishes a user's route from a set of possible routes in real-time. They also attempted to infer new routes by constructing projected route power profiles aggregated from shorter, known segment power profiles, all using 3G networks. With a 'modest' number of applications running, they achieved accurate results in 2/3 of the scenarios, while the results degraded to an accuracy of 1/5 with additional active applications like Facebook and Skype. They are also limited by the need to provide data to the learning machine, which itself limits scalability in obtaining training data.

### Behavior Analysis

This research area involves determining user modality from smartphone sensors. For example, **Kwapisz et al. [31]** discussed ergonomic/activity identification using learned data from walking, jogging, climbing stairs, sitting, and standing to ascertain user activity. They identified and collected data for 43 features from a 29-person sample set. Raw data was evaluated using the WEKA data mining tool suite to develop decision tree, logistic regression, and multilayer neural network models. Excluding motions associated with moving up and down stairs, the method can identify activity nearly 90% of the time. Although well-suited for human activity identification, it has limited ability to ascertain paths with fewer start and stop points.

**Lee and Mase [32]** studied the feasibility of detecting user behavior such as sitting, standing, walking on level ground, going up or down a stairway, and determining the number of steps taken to infer a person's location in an indoor environment. They developed a system using the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to measure forward and upward acceleration and the angle of the user’s legs. The compass was used to determine the direction of movement. The phone was mounted on different body locations, and a dead-reckoning method was applied to estimate the user’s physical location. The authors showed that their system efficiently calculated the number of steps and location for eight individuals using a predefined database of selected locations in an office environment. They claimed a high recognition ratio of 91.8% for ten unique location transitions.

### Other Works of Interest

Two additional works are noteworthy: a pattern matching/machine vision approach to path traversal tracking and a framework to measure the effectiveness of the attack.

**Kupeev et al. [33]** decomposed shape contours into segments to determine similarity. They analyzed 24 shape distances with 32 unique quantized rotation angles against one another, with an error rate of less than 10%. This technique has limited use in the location privacy space due to the subtle differences in road contours that may not be distinguishable between similar yet geographically separate roads.

**Shokri et al. [34]** suggested a framework for scoring location privacy protection mechanisms. They defined a triad taxonomy of accuracy, certainty, and correctness, where the latter represents the metric that determines the privacy of the user. To our knowledge, this is the first significant attempt at establishing an evaluation framework. Although not utilized in this work, it provides a foundation for future evaluations of our results compared with the truth.

### Conclusion

We modeled the problem of tracking vehicular users as the problem of identifying the most likely route on a graph derived from the city’s roads public database. The performance results of our algorithms, both in simulations and experiments, indicate that in most cities, a significant number of users are vulnerable to tracking by seemingly innocuous applications that do not request permissions to any sensitive information. We believe this calls for rigorous methods and tools to mitigate side-channel attacks using mobile phone sensors.
