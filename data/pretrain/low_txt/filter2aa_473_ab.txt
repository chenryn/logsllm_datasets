# Integrity and Connection

Even if they don't feel better today...
Even if you missed that call that time...
Even if you don't know what to say sometimes...
If they know you care, friends (and sometimes even strangers) will reach out to you when it counts.

- Graphic adapted from QPR Instructor supplemental training materials

## Threat Analysis
1. **Is a suicide attempt in progress now?**
2. **What's wrong?**
   - **Ideation:**
     - Current suicidal thoughts?
     - Within the past two months?
     - Frequency of recurrence?
     - Length of episodes?

     - Why now?
       - Who is involved?
         - Degree of isolation (physical and psychological)
         - Negative relationships (risks), Positive relationships (buffers)
       - Why NOT now?
         - Identify reasons for living, protective factors

### Intent
- With what? (has not decided | has means now | easy access | lethality)
- Where and when? (vague | detailed | preparatory acts)

### Threat Level
This chart represents a range of risk levels and interventions, not actual determinations.

| Risk Level | Risk / Protective Factors | Suicidality | Possible Interventions |
|------------|---------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| HIGH       | Psychiatric disorders with severe symptoms, or acute precipitating event; protective factors not relevant | Potentially lethal suicide attempt or persistent ideation with strong intent or suicide rehearsal | Admission generally indicated unless a significant change reduces risk. Suicide precautions |
| MODERATE   | Multiple risk factors, few protective factors | Suicidal ideation with plan, but no intent or behavior | Admission may be necessary depending on risk factors. Develop crisis plan. Give emergency / crisis numbers |
| LOW        | Modifiable risk factors, strong protective factors | Thoughts of death, no plan, intent, or behavior | Outpatient referral, symptom reductions. Give emergency / crisis numbers |

## Reporting Obligations
Legal / Ethical Responsibility to Report:
- Doctors, nurses, trained medical professionals
- Counselors, therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc.
- Licensed teachers & administrators
- Social workers (duty to warn and protect)
- Crisis hotline volunteers (as possible)
- Scientific researchers

Are you a licensed professional being paid to evaluate the PIC's mental state?

## Active Listening
### Building Rapport & Trust
- Constructive
  - Ask one question at a time
  - Give the person time to respond
  - Repeat back the person's input to confirm understanding
  - Say when you don't understand, ask for clarification
  - Ask open-ended questions
- Destructive
  - Interrupting
  - Asking questions in succession
  - Promising to keep a secret
  - "Leading the witness"
  - Trying to solve their problems
  - Rational/Philosophical arguments
  - Minimizing their concerns or fears

### Organic Threat Assessment
- Elicit risks and protective factors
- Example:
  - **PIC:** I never say the right thing. I don't have friends. No one understands me.
  - **Responder:** It sounds like you feel lonely and misunderstood. Does that sound right?
  - **PIC:** Yeah.
  - **Responder:** Have you ever told anyone else you feel that way? OR When you feel like that, what do you usually do?

### Separate Feelings from States of Being
- **Example:**
  - "I AM lonely [and no one will ever love me]."
  - "I FEEL lonely right now, but I could talk to a friend."
  - "I FEEL heartbroken and exhausted and furious and overwhelmed right now, but I didn't always feel this way in the past, and I won't always feel this way in the future. I can't change what happened, but I can change how I react to how I feel about it."

### Identify Feelings That Can Be Addressed Directly
- Sad, Depressed, Suicidal
- Afraid, Apprehensive, Confused, Hesitant, Embarrassed, Guilty, Tense, Anxious, Frightened, Panicked, Annoyed, Dismayed, Impatient, Angry, Outraged, Resentful, Averse, Repulsed, Hungry, Lost, Disconnected, Bored, Cold, Distracted, Numb, Disquieted, Restless, Shocked, Uncomfortable, Lonely, Self-Conscious, Fatigued, Exhausted, Tired, Worn Out, Pain, Grief, Heartbroken, Regretful, Discouraged, Hopeless, Edgy, Frazzled, Overwhelmed, Vulnerable, Fragile, Shaky, Yearning, Jealous, Nostalgic, Wistful, Hateful

### Identifying Root Feelings
- Example:
  - **PIC:** I am so burnt out.
  - **PIC:** I feel exhausted from working all the time and going home just stresses me out more.
  - **PIC:** I feel exhausted from working all the time and angry that I have to be on call 24/7 just to get an ounce of recognition from my boss, and the attitude I take home isn't making my family life any better. And this new guy at work is eyeing my stapler, that bastard.
  - **PIC:** That new guy seems pretty good, and I'm terrified he's going to replace me if I can't prove to everyone that I'm on his level. But what if I try to learn the new stuff, I'll find out I'm not as fast at it as I used to be? My family would be so disappointed in me if they knew. I've been shutting them out, and now I feel guilty that it's gone on for so long that I can't bring it up and admit this is all my fault. I think about home when I'm at work, and work when I'm at home, and get nothing constructive done at either.

## Solutions
### Make the Hand-Off (Assuming Threat Level is Low)
- Identify professional resources in your area
- Use the internet to find local resources
- Find out about the PIC's insurance plan
- Find out about current/past therapy relationships
- Make the call for an appointment
- Go together or schedule a meet-up before or after the appointment

### Enlist Buffers
- Distribute risk, don't be a single point of contact
- Identify people who can help whom the PIC trusts
- Get the PIC to agree to talk to them
- Identify recurring appointments, ensure they continue
- Document in the crisis plan

### Proactive Crisis Plan
- Formulate while in the more rational phase of a cycle
- Distribute to friends, secure their support ahead of time
- Example:
  - For when I'm feeling:
    - Overwhelmed
    - Angry
    - Helpless
    - Confused
    - Lonely
  - Possible Activities:
    - Play MMO
    - Walk around the city
    - Work on blog
    - Make a gift for someone
    - Learn to cook a new thing
    - Read at the cafe
  - MY CRISIS PLAN:
    1. Take a deep breath
    2. Ask for suicidal thoughts to be removed from my brain
    3. HALT
    4. Take another deep breath
    5. Identify feelings
    6. Practice Feelings vs. Facts
    7. Write down the feeling for later review
    8. "Do in spite of how I feel"
    9. Choose an activity
    10. See who's online / call someone
    11. 5 minutes of meditation
    12. Choose a task and practice doing it in the present
    13. Call emergency contact
    14. Put down weapons and keep both hands on the phone

## Tactical Crisis Response
### Resources
- **You!** Talking to someone trusted who is educated about suicide intervention can save a life. If possible, talk in person. While implementing QPR, you can research alternate referral options and help get the PIC to a safe space.
- **911** If you think/know an attempt is in progress, call Emergency Services immediately.
- **Current or Past Therapist** Professionals with knowledge of the PIC's medical / psychological history are invaluable. Past therapists can help make quality referrals (e.g., after a move or due to insurance change). If the PIC won't make the call, you can.
- **Hospital / Counseling Center** Making the physical move to a safe environment drastically lowers mortality risk.
