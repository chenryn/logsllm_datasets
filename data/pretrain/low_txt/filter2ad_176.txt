## Problem Definition

- **GSM Network Overview:**
  - A large array of towers broadcasts messages.
  - Can these messages reveal a phone's location?
  - Given a person's phone number, can we locate the tower they are connected to in a GSM network?

- **Key Points:**
  - GSM is the dominant protocol worldwide.
  - The analysis focuses on layer 2/3 messages.
  - No collaboration from the service provider.
  - No support from applications.

## Cellular Network Architecture

- **Components:**
  - Visitor Location Register (VLR)
  - Home Location Register (HLR)
  - GSM Air Interface
  - Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
  - Service Provider Core Network
  - Mobile Station
  - International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)
  - Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI)

## The GSM Paging Procedure

- **Sequence:**
  - **Paging Request:** Common Control Channel (CCCH)
  - **Channel Request:** Random Access Channel (RACH)
  - **Immediate Assignment:** CCCH
  - **Paging Response:** Stand-alone Dedicated Control Channel (SDCCH)
  - **Setup and Data**

## Measurement Platform

- **Equipment:**
  - Serial cable and reprogrammer cable ($30)
  - T-Mobile G1 with custom Android Kernel ($100)
  - OsmocomBB (free, modified for US frequency bands)
  - Motorola C118 ($30)

## GSM Paging Channel Observations

- **Data:**
  - **T-Mobile LAC 747b:**
    - IMSI Paging Requests: 27,120
    - TMSI Paging Requests: 257,159
    - Type 1 Paging Requests: 284,279
    - Type 2 Paging Requests: 1,635
    - Type 3 Paging Requests: 0
    - Observation Period: 24 hours

  - **AT&T LAC 7d11:**
    - IMSI Paging Requests: 8,897
    - TMSI Paging Requests: 84,526
    - Type 1 Paging Requests: 91,539
    - Type 2 Paging Requests: 26
    - Type 3 Paging Requests: 1
    - Observation Period: 24 hours

## Pages and Human Activity

- **Observations:**
  - Peak activity in the afternoon.
  - Low traffic after midnight.
  - University campus during the semester.
  - Day of the week.

- **Graph:**
  - Time/min, April 2011, CDT
  - Peaks and troughs in paging requests.

## Phone Number-TMSI Mapping

- **Process:**
  - PSTN
  - Paging Channel (PCH)
  - Time

- **No Recovered TMSI:**
  - PSTN
  - PCH
  - Time

## Silent Paging

- **Delay Analysis:**
  - Delay between call initiation and paging request: 3 seconds
  - Median delay between call initiation and ring: 6 seconds

- **Graph:**
  - Time/seconds

## Bounding the LAC

- **LAC Characteristics:**
  - LACs can be very large (e.g., T-Mobile LAC 747d: 100kmÂ²).
  - Used a wall-following algorithm, road permitting.
  - Call to MS on NW corner.
  - Observed paging request on SE corner.

## Same Tower Test

- **Delay Between Messages:**
  - Delay between paging request and immediate assignment message.
  - Graph: Time difference between paging and IA messages / seconds

## Finding Individual Towers

- **Algorithm:**
  - Hill-climbing algorithm.
  - Non-uniform RF attenuation.
  - Overshoot by 50m to avoid local maximum.

## ARFCN a Phone is Likely to Camp On

- **Details:**
  - Specific ARFCNs (Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Numbers) that a phone is likely to camp on.

## Tracking Users in Motion

- **Diagram:**
  - Start and End points for user tracking.

## Defenses

- **Proposed Solutions:**
  - Page multiple areas.
  - Ensure phone/TMSI bitwise unlinkability to prevent traffic analysis.
  - Use cover traffic.
  - Add exponential delay to paging requests.

- **Key Points:**
  - Less than 0.6% of paging requests are not type 1.
  - Available bandwidth for additional pages.
  - Human trajectories are predictable.
  - Continuous time mixes.
  - Switch TMSI at least once per page.

## Conclusion

- **Summary:**
  - Systems with broadcast paging protocols can leak location information.
  - Leaks observable with readily available equipment and no direct help from the service provider.
  - Proposed low-cost fixes.
  - Responsible disclosures made to 3GPP, Nokia, and AT&T research.
