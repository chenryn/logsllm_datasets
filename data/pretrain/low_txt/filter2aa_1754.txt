# Evil DoS Attacks and Strong Defenses
**Presenters: Sam Bowne and Matthew Prince**

**Date: August 2, 2013**

## Introduction
This presentation covers two types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: Sockstress and the new IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) Flood. We will also discuss effective defense strategies.

## Sockstress Attack
### Overview
- **Year:** 2008
- **Vulnerability:** SPll not patched
- **Attack Method:** Sends a small TCP window size
- **Impact:** Causes sessions to hang, consuming RAM and potentially rendering servers unbootable

### Demo
- **Short-term Mitigation:** Block packets with small window sizes using a firewall.
- **Long-term Solution:** Patch the operating system to reclaim RAM. It has been 5 years, so this should be a priority.

## IPv4 and IPv6 Exhaustion
### IPv4 Exhaustion
- **Remaining Time:** One year left

### IPv6 Exhaustion
- **Link-Local DoS:** Uses IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs)

### Old Attack (2011)
- **Effect on Windows:** Drives CPU usage to 100%
- **Other Affected Systems:** FreeBSD
- **Systems Not Affected:** Mac OS X, Ubuntu Linux

### New RA Flood
- **Enhanced Packet Structure:**
  - Each RA now contains:
    - 17 Route Information sections
    - 18 Prefix Information sections

- **Prerequisites for the Attack:**
  - Send some normal RA packets to put Windows into a vulnerable state. (Thanks to var_x for noting this in my lab at CCSF.)

- **Attack Execution:**
  - Use a gigabit Ethernet NIC on the attacker's machine and a gigabit switch.
  - Use thc-ipv6 2.1 on Linux.
  - Open three terminal windows:
    1. `./fake_router6 eth1 a::/64`
    2. `./fake_router6 eth1 b::/64`
    3. `./flood_router26 eth1`
  - Windows dies within 30 seconds.

- **Effects of the New RA Flood:**
  - **Windows 8 & Server 2012:** Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)
  - **Microsoft Surface RT:** BSOD
  - **Mac OS X:** Dies
  - **Windows 7 & Server 2008 R2 (with "IPv6 Readiness Update"):** Freeze during attack
  - **iPad 3:** Slows down and sometimes crashes
  - **Android Phone:** Slows down and sometimes crashes
  - **Ubuntu Linux:** No harm

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Disable IPv6**
- **Turn off Router Discovery with netsh**
- **Use a firewall to block rogue RAs**
- **Get a switch with RA Guard**
- **Microsoft's "IPv6 Readiness Update" provides some protection for Windows 7 & Server 2008 R2:**
  - Released: November 13, 2012
  - KB: 2750841
  - Note: Not available for Windows 8 or Server 2012
