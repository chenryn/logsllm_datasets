### Data from Local System Mitigation

**Description:**
Identify and manage unnecessary system utilities or potentially malicious software that could be used to collect data from the local system. Audit and, where appropriate, block such software using whitelisting tools like AppLocker, Software Restriction Policies, or other similar mechanisms.

### Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) Mitigation

**Description:**
To mitigate DDE attacks, configure specific registry keys in Microsoft Office to disable automatic DDE/OLE execution. Ensure that Protected View is enabled and consider disabling embedded files in Office programs not enrolled in Protected View. On Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent DDE attacks and the spawning of child processes from Office programs.

### Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) Mitigation

**Description:**
Leverage services provided by Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) or specialized DoS mitigation providers to filter traffic upstream from services. Filter boundary traffic by blocking source addresses, ports, or protocols involved in the attack. For SYN floods, enable SYN Cookies.

### System Time Discovery Mitigation

**Description:**
Benign software often uses legitimate processes to gather system time. Focus on preventing unwanted or unknown code from executing on a system. Block common tools like `net.exe` by policy to prevent common ways of acquiring remote system time. Identify and manage unnecessary system utilities or potentially malicious software that could be used to acquire system time information, and audit and/or block them using whitelisting tools like AppLocker or Software Restriction Policies.

### Code Signing Mitigation

**Description:**
Use process whitelisting and trusted publishers to verify the authenticity of software, which can help prevent signed malicious or untrusted code from executing on a system.

### Systemd Service Mitigation

**Description:**
Limit user access to system utilities such as `systemctl` to only those who have a legitimate need. Restrict read/write access to systemd unit files to select privileged users. Restrict software installation to trusted repositories and be cautious of orphaned software packages. Utilize malicious code protection and application whitelisting to mitigate the ability of malware to create or modify systemd services.

### Network Segmentation

**Description:**
Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems.
