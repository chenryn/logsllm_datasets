## 7.1 Remediation of Existing Affected Domains

As previously explained, once a host object is renamed outside an EPP repository, it cannot be subsequently modified (Section 2.4). Therefore, existing sacrificial nameservers cannot simply be renamed by registrars to fix vulnerable domains in a centralized manner. Instead, each hijackable domain requires individual actions, either by the registrar or the registrant.

To facilitate this remediation, we notified the top ten registrars with the most affected domains. Additionally, we compiled per-registrar lists of the 54,000 hijackable domains and made them available to the registrar community via the DNS Abuse Working Group in November 2020. At least 12 additional registrars utilized these lists. Given that any form of remediation incurs a cost, we were uncertain about the extent of the response.

Since we did not receive concrete communication from any of the 22 registrars regarding their plans for addressing the affected domains, we relied on indirect measures to assess the impact. As shown in Table 5, there was a reduction in the number of affected nameservers (down 9,000 from 36,000) and domains (down 13,000 from 54,000) approximately five months after we began notifying registrars (September 2020 to February 2021).

However, not all changes can be attributed to registrar actions, as some domains naturally expire, and some domain holders may change their delegations organically. To account for this, we calculated the baseline rate of "organic" expiration over the equivalent time period a year prior (September 2019 to February 2020), during which 4,000 sacrificial nameservers and 11,000 affected domains disappeared.

The significant relative improvement in the remediation of hijackable sacrificial nameservers (9,000 compared to 4,000) is primarily due to GoDaddy's actions. GoDaddy updated delegations for hijackable domains they controlled, from their old hijackable renaming to their new renaming idiom. Nearly 60% of the domains remediated (7,877 out of 13,392) and 70% of the hijackable nameservers remediated (6,932 out of 9,757) were a result of GoDaddy's efforts. Another notable, albeit smaller, remediation effort was from MarkMonitor, who successfully remediated around 200 domains (with significant brand names).

Interestingly, the smaller relative change in the number of affected domains (13,000 compared to 11,000) suggests that there is a long tail of sacrificial nameservers affecting a few domains, whose remediation has minimal overall impact.

## 7.2 Preventing New Exposure

Of the six registrars using a hijackable renaming idiom, we successfully notified the three with the largest impact: GoDaddy, Enom, and Internet.bs. In response, all three committed to adopting a non-hijackable domain for future renaming actions. Internet.bs chose a dedicated sink domain, `notaplaceto.be`, for creating new sacrificial nameservers, as did Enom, using `delete-registration.com` for this purpose. GoDaddy, rather than designating a dedicated sink domain, chose to create sacrificial nameservers under `empty.as112.arpa`, originally envisioned as an anycast sink for queries [1].

Table 6 shows the breakdown of sacrificial nameservers created under these new renaming idioms and the domains protected as a result. As of September 2021, these modifications have prevented the creation of roughly 15,000 hijackable sacrificial nameservers, thus protecting over 31,000 domains.

## 7.3 Robust Long-term Fixes

While the use of sink domains is a good short-term fix, it is inherently fragile as it relies on existing registrars to maintain these special domains indefinitely and on new registrars to adopt similar measures. Given the dynamism in the registrar market, it is difficult to count on perfection, and there is past evidence of registrars abandoning sink domains (Section 4). Moreover, because sink domains concentrate dangling delegations, if one such domain is not renewed, it could allow an attacker to control tens of thousands of domains with a single registration.

A more permanent solution likely requires a change to the EPP standard. One potential change would be to require the use of a reserved TLD for renaming. The IETF-reserved `.invalid` TLD, first reserved in 1999 [9] with additional guidance published in 2013 [19], fits this scenario perfectly. The use of `.invalid` eliminates the non-renewal problem. In fact, the idea of creating sacrificial nameservers under a reserved label motivated GoDaddy's use of `empty.as112.arpa`. However, because the `as112.arpa` domain is anycast, it introduces new risks. An attacker controlling an AS112 anycast server could hijack all requests in its vicinity and resolve all such delegations. To partially mitigate this risk, one could use DNSSEC to sign the `empty.as112.arpa` zone or use a new signed sibling zone in `as112.arpa`.

A more ambitious approach would combine protocol and operational changes to remove the underlying "garbage collection" problem for deleted nameserver domains. By changing the deletion rules in EPP—so that deletion of a domain also removes all references (i.e., nameserver delegations) to any subordinate host objects—it would prevent the creation of new dangling delegations inside an EPP repository. However, fully addressing inter-registry links across EPP repositories (e.g., a nameserver domain in `.com` used by domains in `.org`) would require a new mechanism to report such domain deletions among registries so that they too could automate the removal of links to deleted nameservers.

Based on our findings, the ICANN Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) is considering a multi-stakeholder effort to evaluate tradeoffs among proposed solutions and publish an advisory of recommended practices.

## 8 Ethical Considerations

We carefully designed our study to identify and address potential ethical risks, evaluating potential harms through a consequentialist lens. We believe our work introduces no new harm and, in fact, reduces the potential harm that would have existed without our research.

First, this work primarily relied on publicly available datasets and data that is implicitly public due to how the DNS works (i.e., the current resolution of a DNS name). Where we identified concrete risks or harms (i.e., of domain hijacking), we reached out to affected registrars and registries. We worked with these communities not only to aid in mitigating currently exposed domains but also to prevent future exposures via changes in operational practice. We chose not to highlight currently vulnerable names in this paper to avoid facilitating their exploitation.

Second, we designed our controlled experiment (Section 6.1) to have zero impact on the `.edu` domain name in question. We selected this particular domain because it did not have any operational authoritative nameservers, thus neither resolving nor being used by the institution. To further reduce potential impact, we configured the sacrificial nameserver (under our control) to return an A record if and only if the request originated from our client IP address during a short testing window. All other queries received no response (as they always had before). Thus, only in our restricted environment did the sacrificial nameserver in our control return a response. Given that we did not respond, the only information that could have been revealed was the identity of the recursive resolver trying to look up one of the associated domains. While we believe such a risk is low, we further mitigated that concern by deleting all log data (and hence any record of who looked up the domain). We balanced this minimal residual risk against the value in conducting this experiment, which we conducted to validate our understanding of the problem and to ensure there were no mechanisms that would prevent hijacking from succeeding.

Finally, because our Institutional Review Board (IRB) is focused on overseeing human subjects research (which this work is not), they were in no position to give us independent oversight. For this reason, we conferred with campus general counsel, whose remit is broader than simply human subjects research, and received their approval for our experimental design and its controls before any active measurements were conducted.

## 9 Conclusion

Our primary technical discovery in this work is how an unforeseen interaction between registrar operational practices and the constraints of registry provisioning systems has made at least half a million domains vulnerable to hijacking. This risk arises from a long-standing, undocumented registrar operational practice that bypasses restrictions on domain deletion by first renaming nameservers slated for removal. These nameservers are commonly renamed to point to domains in different TLDs in which the registrar does not have interest or control. As a result, a simple re-registration of the deleted domain does not address the vulnerability. This subtlety, combined with the fact that affected domain owner’s nameserver records are modified without their knowledge, makes this vulnerability particularly insidious.

While most of the domains placed at risk in this manner are either unpopular or moribund, some include sites where the names carry reputation even if they do not receive much traffic (e.g., law enforcement, law offices, public health departments, and even parked domains for popular brands in alternate TLDs). Our work provides a comprehensive picture of this long-standing vulnerability and describes how our outreach has led to changes in operational practices at registrars that should significantly minimize these risks going forward.
