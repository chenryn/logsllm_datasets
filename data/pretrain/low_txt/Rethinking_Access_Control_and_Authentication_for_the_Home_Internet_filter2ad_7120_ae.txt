### Authentication and Identification in Home IoT

Performing a gesture differently can serve as a form of authentication, allowing for the identification of individuals and their relationships. Additionally, the proximity of wearable devices is useful in identifying contextual factors such as user location and nearby people. From a false positive/negative perspective, biometric methods require significant tuning, which can influence an owner's decision to use this method, especially for high-access scenarios or operating dangerous equipment like lawn mowers.

Voice assistants are becoming increasingly common in homes. While they can perform speaker identification (e.g., Google Home Voice Match), they are currently used more for personalization rather than as a security boundary. However, future versions with additional hardware could be more effective in determining a speaker’s identity and relationship for access control. Such assistants could also help identify contextual factors like user location and the presence of nearby people (e.g., a supervising adult near children). Voice-based methods will require tuning, as audio is sensitive to background noise and introduces privacy concerns, including eavesdropping and replay attacks.

Advances in computer vision can also be leveraged to identify users, their relationships, and their location within a home using cameras. However, computer vision systems can sometimes falsely identify individuals or confuse identities, necessitating some level of false positive/negative tuning, especially in households with many temporary occupants. A significant downside is the privacy risk, as cameras can track home activity at a high level of granularity. Some privacy issues could be mitigated through local processing or privacy-preserving vision algorithms.

Bilateral or continuous authentication mechanisms ensure that a user is both physically present and currently using the device. These mechanisms can effectively identify users and their relationships, and support contextual factors involving user presence. The false positive/negative rates vary based on the specific implementation. If a wearable device with a continuous authentication algorithm is used, these rates must be considered. Privacy concerns can be alleviated if the mechanism is implemented in a decentralized manner, involving only the user’s proxy device and the target device. This approach also provides a simple solution to the de-authentication problem (revoking access if a temporary visitor is no longer welcome).

In summary, we have taken initial steps toward reenvisioning access control and authentication in the home IoT. Much work remains in translating these observations into fully usable prototypes and supporting richer capabilities and interactions.
