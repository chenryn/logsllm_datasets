## Abstract
The detection and suspension of Twitter spammers are crucial for maintaining a spam-free online community. However, spammers are continually evolving to evade existing detection techniques. In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of the evasion tactics employed by Twitter spammers and design several new, robust features to detect them. We also formalize the robustness of 24 commonly used detection features from the literature, as well as our proposed ones. Our experiments show that our newly designed features significantly outperform three state-of-the-art approaches [35, 32, 34] in detecting Twitter spammers, achieving a higher detection rate while maintaining a lower false positive rate.

## 1. Introduction
Twitter has become a platform for spammers to achieve malicious goals such as sending spam, spreading malware, hosting botnet command and control (C&C) channels, and performing other illicit activities. These behaviors can cause significant economic losses and even threaten national security. For instance, in August 2009, nearly 11% of all Twitter posts were spam [1]. In May 2009, many innocent users' accounts were hacked to spread advertisements [2]. In February 2010, thousands of Twitter users, including prominent figures, had their accounts hijacked due to a viral phishing attack [19].

To combat these issues, researchers and Twitter engineers have developed various methods to protect legitimate users. Twitter has published definitions of spam accounts and The Twitter Rules [14] to protect users from spam and abuse. Accounts engaging in abnormal activities are subject to temporary or permanent suspension. Additionally, many research studies, such as [25, 32, 22, 35, 34], use machine learning techniques to detect Twitter spammers.

However, the arms race between attackers and defenders leads spammers to evolve and evade detection. For example, spammers can purchase followers [6] or use tools to automatically post tweets with the same meaning but different words [15].

In this paper, we aim to design more robust features to detect Twitter spammers by analyzing their evasion tactics. We collect and analyze approximately 500,000 Twitter accounts and over 14 million tweets using the Twitter API [18]. We identify around 2,000 Twitter spammers using blacklist and honeypot techniques. We then describe and validate current evasion tactics through case studies and by evaluating three state-of-the-art approaches [35, 32, 34] on our dataset. Based on our analysis, we design ten new features, including graph-based, neighbor-based, timing-based, and automation-based features, to detect Twitter spammers. Our evaluation shows that these new features significantly improve detection rates while maintaining a low false positive rate.

### Contributions
- **Empirical Analysis:** We present the first in-depth empirical analysis of evasion tactics used by current Twitter spammers based on a large dataset.
- **Evaluation of State-of-the-Art Solutions:** We evaluate the detection rates of three state-of-the-art solutions on our collected dataset, showing that even the best detector misses around 27% of spammers.
- **New Detection Features:** We propose and test ten new detection features, including neighbor-based features, which significantly increase the detection rate to 85% while maintaining a low false positive rate.
- **Robustness Framework:** We provide a new framework to formalize the robustness of 24 detection features, categorizing them into low, medium, and high robustness.

## 2. Related Work
Many studies have focused on the topological characteristics of Twitter, such as the distribution of followers and followings [31], and diverse metrics to measure Twitter accounts [25]. Other works have addressed spam and attacks in online social networks, including tag spam detection [30], video spammers in video social networks [24, 23], and social spam campaigns in Facebook [27].

For Twitter, existing detection work can be categorized into two types: machine learning-based approaches [32, 22, 35, 34] and URL-based approaches [28]. Our work differs by focusing on analyzing evasion tactics and designing new machine learning features to effectively detect Twitter spammers. We also formalize the robustness of 24 detection features, providing a valuable supplement to existing research.

## 3. Data Collection
We describe our data collection strategies and results, including crawling Twitter profiles and identifying spammers.

### 3.1 Crawling Twitter Profiles
We developed a Twitter crawler using the Streaming API [18] to decrease sampling bias. We collected 20 seed Twitter accounts from the public timeline [20], crawled their followers and followings, and repeated this process. For each account, we collected its 40 most recent tweets and followed URL redirection chains. This resulted in a dataset of nearly 500,000 Twitter accounts with over 14 million tweets and 6 million URLs (Table 1).

### 3.2 Identifying Twitter Spammers
We focused on spammers posting harmful links to phishing or malware sites. We used Google Safe Browsing [9] and Capture-HPC [7] to detect malicious or phishing URLs. We defined a tweet containing at least one malicious or phishing URL as a spam tweet and calculated the spam ratio for each account. We identified 2,933 accounts with a spam ratio higher than 10%, manually verified them, and identified 2,060 spam accounts.

## 4. Analyzing Evasion Tactics
We describe and validate the evasion tactics used by spammers to evade existing detection schemes.

### 4.1 Description of Evasion Tactics
Spammers use two main categories of evasion tactics: profile-based and content-based.

#### Profile-Based Evasion Tactics
- **Gaining More Followers:** Spammers can purchase followers, exchange followers, or create fake accounts to gain more followers.
- **Posting More Tweets:** Spammers can post more tweets to appear more active and legitimate, often using public tweeting tools or software.

#### Content-Based Evasion Tactics
- **Mixing Normal Tweets:** Spammers can dilute their spam tweets by mixing them with normal tweets.
- **Posting Heterogeneous Tweets:** Spammers can post tweets with the same semantic meaning but different words to evade content-based features.

### 4.2 Validation of Evasion Tactics
We validated these tactics through real case studies and by evaluating existing detection schemes [32, 34, 35] on our dataset. We found that spammers are evolving to behave like legitimate accounts, making it harder for existing features to detect them.

## 5. Conclusion
Our empirical analysis and new detection features significantly improve the detection of Twitter spammers. Future work will focus on further refining these features and exploring additional evasion tactics.
