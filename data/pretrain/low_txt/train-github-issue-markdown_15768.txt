In issue #23461, I highlighted the challenges of writing automation scripts for `kubectl`. While it is essential to check for errors at each stage, the script should not be so fragile that it fails if the API server is not up and reachable 100% of the time. Requiring users (including ourselves) to implement retry logic in their shell scripts does not seem like the right approach. Instead, I propose adding built-in retry functionality to `kubectl`, which can be disabled by default if desired.
