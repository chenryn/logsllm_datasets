### 7.2 Validation of bdrmapIT on ITDK Data

The second set of experiments highlights the advantages of bdrmapIT's adapted heuristics in mapping network borders within Internet-wide datasets. To clearly demonstrate the differences between bdrmapIT and its predecessor, bdrmap, we used traceroute datasets that exclude VPs (vantage points) from any of the validation networks. We compared bdrmapIT's results with those of MAP-IT, another tool designed for Internet-wide border mapping.

For these experiments, we utilized publicly available CAIDA ITDK (Internet Topology Data Kit) datasets from March 2016 [1] and February 2018 [6]. These datasets include traceroutes collected over 15 days, along with alias resolution for some interfaces. We removed traceroutes originating from VPs in our ground truth networks to ensure no overlap. This left us with 109 out of 111 VPs in the 2016 ITDK and 141 out of 146 VPs in the 2018 ITDK. All traceroutes were conducted using ICMP Paris traceroute [15,39], which controls IP and transport headers to reduce load balancing, and a combination of iffinder [21] and MIDAR [22] for alias resolution.

Similar to the validation approach used by MAP-IT [31], we evaluated the precision and recall of our inferences. Precision, in this context, is the fraction of inferred interdomain links that are correct (i.e., they are not internal to a network, and we correctly identified the connected networks). Recall is the number of correctly identified interdomain links that appear in the dataset. When computing recall, we excluded interfaces that only appeared as Echo Replies. Unlike the previous experiments, which focused solely on correctness, these experiments test bdrmapIT's ability to find interdomain links in a dataset.

Figure 16 shows that bdrmapIT significantly outperforms MAP-IT, with better precision for all ground truth networks except the large access network, and vastly better recall. Overall, bdrmapIT achieved precision ranging from 91.8% to 98.8% and recall ranging from 93.2% to 97.1%.

All the adapted heuristics contribute to bdrmapIT's higher accuracy, but the most significant improvement comes from the use of destination ASes in the last hop heuristic (§5). MAP-IT does not utilize destination information, making it unable to identify certain links. Additionally, bdrmapIT's enhanced ability to leverage AS relationships, particularly in the third-party heuristic (§6.1.1) and the multihomed customer exception (§6.1.3), improves coverage of low-visibility links at the Internet edge. Links between an ISP and an edge AS are especially challenging for MAP-IT, as traceroute often reveals more interfaces from the provider's address space on a border router than customer addresses past the border, if an address from the operating AS even appears in a traceroute.

Finally, Figure 17 illustrates the difference in coverage when excluding interdomain links that only appear as the last hop in the traceroute dataset. Even in this scenario, bdrmapIT substantially outperforms MAP-IT, indicating that the adapted heuristics and our more aggressive inference strategy lead to significantly better results.

### 7.3 Effect of Reducing the Number of VPs

The next set of experiments evaluated whether bdrmapIT's performance is dependent on the number of VPs included in the ITDK datasets. We validated bdrmapIT's performance using groups of 20, 40, 60, and 80 VPs, running five experiments in each group with five randomly chosen sets of VPs. For all experiments, we excluded VPs in our ground truth networks.

The results, shown in Figure 18, display the average of the five sets of VPs for each group, along with the standard error. Surprisingly, bdrmapIT's accuracy does not diminish as the number of VPs decreases. In the groups with 20 VPs, the precision ranges from 92.4% to 99.6%, and the recall is between 95.4% and 98.6%. Similarly, when increasing the number of VPs to 80, the precision (93.1%–98.5%) and recall (94.0%–97.2%) remain roughly equivalent, with the means falling within a standard deviation of each other. Although the number of interdomain links visible in the dataset drops with the reduction in VPs (Figure 19), bdrmapIT's ability to correctly identify those that appear does not diminish. This is an important result, as researchers might have only a few VPs at their disposal.

### 7.4 Importance of Alias Resolution

Finally, we investigated the impact of alias resolution on bdrmapIT's accuracy. First, we examined the effect of using a different alias resolution technique on the same set of traceroutes. Specifically, we used kapar [20] along with midar and iffinder, while the results presented in §7.2 used only midar and iffinder. Second, we demonstrated that bdrmapIT performs nearly equivalently with midar and iffinder alias resolution as it does without any alias resolution.

**kapar Alias Resolution:**
Along with the alias resolution datasets used in §7.2, the CAIDA ITDK includes a second alias resolution dataset that incorporates kapar. Unlike midar, which produces highly precise alias groups, kapar attempts to increase the number of grouped aliases, which can result in less precise groupings [8]. To determine the impact of less accurate but larger alias groups on bdrmapIT's inferences, we ran experiments for both the 2016 and 2018 ITDKs using the alias resolution that includes kapar.

The results, shown in Figure 20, clearly demonstrate that the less precise IRs (inference results) generated by kapar decrease the accuracy of bdrmapIT's inferences. To highlight the differences between the alias groupings, Figure 20 only includes IRs with multiple aliases. In our ground truth datasets, kapar has a tendency to mistakenly group interfaces into a single IR when, in reality, they are used on different physical routers. Since bdrmapIT ensures that each router receives a single AS annotation and then uses that information to determine interdomain links, imprecise alias resolution results in inaccurate inferences.

**No Alias Resolution:**
Our final experiment aimed to determine the impact of using midar and iffinder alias resolution compared to not using any alias resolution. To do so, we ran bdrmapIT on the ITDK datasets, treating each interface as a separate IR. The results were nearly identical, with less than a 0.1% difference in accuracy between using alias resolution with midar and iffinder and using an interface graph with no alias resolution.

Interestingly, the aggregation resulting from alias resolution can impact the results both positively and negatively. Occasionally, the additional IR links enable bdrmapIT to more accurately determine the IR operator when one or more IR interface would not have sufficient constraints for bdrmapIT to make a correct inference. Conversely, reallocated addresses and third-party addresses seen subsequent to a single interface can add confusion, causing bdrmapIT to infer the incorrect operator for an IR group, while without alias resolution, the mistake would be limited to part of the IR. In our experiments, the negative impacts of alias resolution occurred exclusively at the edge of the Tier 1 network, where reallocated prefixes are common. Further investigation is necessary to determine when bdrmapIT with alias resolution performs better than using an interface graph.

### 8. Conclusion

We addressed the challenging problem of mapping the borders of IP networks, which currently hampers both research and regulatory efforts. In addressing this challenge, we presented bdrmapIT, a traceroute analysis technique designed to infer the operating AS for routers and identify links between Internet networks. Our method synthesizes two previous approaches, bdrmap and MAP-IT, leveraging the strengths of each technique to create a general-purpose solution.

To evaluate bdrmapIT, we performed experiments from in-network and out-of-network VPs, validating the accuracy of our technique and demonstrating that bdrmapIT outperforms its predecessors. Additional experiments showed that bdrmapIT's performance does not diminish as we reduce the number of VPs. Our results suggest that bdrmapIT can form the foundation upon which to address other network diagnostic challenges, including congestion measurement [32,38], resilience assessment [14,25,33,36], and traffic estimation [35]. We publicly release our source code.
