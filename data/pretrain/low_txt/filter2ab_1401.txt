**ATT&CK ID:** S1018  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Saint Bot

**Description:**
Saint Bot has been observed renaming malicious binaries as `wallpaper.mp4` and `slideshow.mp4` in an effort to evade detection. [36][37]

This technique leverages the use of common and innocuous file names to blend in with legitimate files, thereby reducing the likelihood of being flagged by security systems.
