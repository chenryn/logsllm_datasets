When you create a new Flutter module using the command `flutter create -t module foo`, the generated `.gitignore` file within the `foo` directory includes the line `.android`. My tests indicate that excluding this directory from the git repository can cause issues for other developers who try to clone and work on your project.

To test this, follow these steps:

1. Start with an existing Android project and integrate a Flutter module by following the instructions provided in the [Flutter documentation](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Add-Flutter-to-existing-apps).
2. Create a new Git repository that includes both the Android app and the Flutter module. Commit and push all changes.
3. On another machine, clone the repository and attempt to open the project in Android Studio.

You will likely encounter an error similar to the one below:
```
Error: /path/to/your/project/.android/include_flutter.groovy
Consult IDE log for more details (Help | Show Log)
```

Here is the output of `flutter doctor -v` for reference:

To avoid such errors, it is recommended to remove the `.android` entry from the `.gitignore` file and commit the `.android` directory to the repository.
