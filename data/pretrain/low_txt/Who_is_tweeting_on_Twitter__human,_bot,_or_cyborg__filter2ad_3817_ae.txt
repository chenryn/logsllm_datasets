### 5.3 Classification System Accuracy

To validate the accuracy of our proposed classification system, we created a test set containing one thousand users from each class, ensuring no overlap with the training set. The classification results on this test set are presented in the confusion matrix shown in Table 3.

In Table 3, the "Actual" rows represent the true classes of the users, while the "Classified" columns represent the classes assigned by the classification system. For example, the value 949 in the "Human" row and "Human" column indicates that 949 humans were correctly classified as humans. Conversely, the value 51 in the "Human" row and "Cyborg" column indicates that 51 humans were incorrectly classified as cyborgs. Notably, there was no misclassification between humans and bots.

#### Analysis of Misclassifications

We analyzed the logs of users who were misclassified to understand the reasons behind these errors:

- **Human Category:**
  - 5.1% of human users were incorrectly classified as cyborgs.
  - One reason for this is that some human users received spam content penalties, which lowered their overall scores.
  - Additionally, certain patterns and phrases used by both humans and bots, such as "I post my online marketing experience at my blog at http://bit.ly/xT6klM. Please ReTweet it," can lead to misclassification.
  - Another factor is that the tweeting interval distribution of some human users is slightly lower than the entropy mean, leading to penalties.

- **Bot Category:**
  - 6.3% of bots were incorrectly classified as cyborgs.
  - The primary reason is that many bots avoid spam penalties from the machine learning component.
  - Some spam tweets use very obscure text content, making it difficult for the system to identify them as spam without checking the links.

- **Cyborg Category:**
  - 9.8% of cyborgs were misclassified as humans, and 7.4% were misclassified as bots.
  - Cyborgs can be either human-assisted bots or bot-assisted humans.
  - A strict policy might categorize cyborgs as bots, while a more lenient policy might categorize them as humans.

Overall, our classification system can accurately differentiate between humans and bots. However, distinguishing cyborgs from humans or bots remains a significant challenge.

### 5.4 Twitter Composition

Using the classification system, we automatically classified our entire dataset of over 500,000 users. Based on the classification results, we can estimate the current composition of the Twitter user population. The system classified 48.7% of users as humans, 37.5% as cyborgs, and 13.8% as bots. Therefore, we speculate that the population proportion of humans, cyborgs, and bots on Twitter is roughly 5:4:1.

### 5.5 Resistance to Evasion

We now discuss the resistance of the classification system to potential evasion attempts by bots. Bots may attempt to deceive certain features, such as the followers-to-friends ratio. However, our system has two critical features that are very difficult for bots to evade:

1. **Tweeting Device Makeup:**
   - This feature corresponds to the manual/auto device percentage in Table 2.
   - Manual devices include web and mobile platforms, while auto devices include APIs and other automated programs.
   - Tweeting via the web requires a user to log in and manually post via the Twitter website in a browser.
   - Currently, it is impractical or expensive to run a bot on a mobile device to frequently tweet.
   - As long as Twitter can correctly identify different tweeting platforms, device makeup is an effective metric for bot detection.

2. **URL Ratio:**
   - Given the limited tweet length of up to 140 characters, most bots include URLs to redirect users to external sites.
   - A high URL ratio is another effective metric for bot detection.
   - Other features, such as timing entropy, can be mimicked by bots, but at the cost of reduced tweeting frequency.

We will continue to explore new features emerging with Twitter's development to enhance bot detection in the future.

### 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we have studied the problem of automation by bots and cyborgs on Twitter. As a popular web application, Twitter has become a unique platform for information sharing with a large user base. However, its popularity and open nature have made it a tempting target for exploitation by automated programs, i.e., bots. The problem of bots on Twitter is further complicated by the key role that automation plays in everyday Twitter usage.

To better understand the role of automation on Twitter, we measured and characterized the behaviors of humans, bots, and cyborgs. By crawling Twitter, we collected one month of data from over 500,000 users, encompassing more than 40 million tweets. Based on this data, we identified features that can differentiate between humans, bots, and cyborgs. Using entropy measures, we determined that humans exhibit complex timing behavior (high entropy), whereas bots and cyborgs often display regular or periodic timing (low entropy). We also observed that a high proportion of bot tweets contain spam content. Lastly, we discovered that certain account properties, such as external URL ratio and tweeting device makeup, are very helpful in detecting automation.

Based on our measurements and characterization, we designed an automated classification system consisting of four main components:
- **Entropy Component:** Checks for periodic or regular tweet timing patterns.
- **Machine Learning Component:** Checks for spam content.
- **Account Properties Component:** Checks for abnormal values of Twitter-account-related properties.
- **Decision Maker:** Summarizes the identified features and decides whether the user is a human, bot, or cyborg.

The effectiveness of the classification system was evaluated using a test dataset. Additionally, we applied the system to classify the entire dataset of over 500,000 users and speculated on the current composition of the Twitter user population based on the classification results.
