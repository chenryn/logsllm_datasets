### International Law and Cybercrime
- **Current Challenges:**
  - The Internet is a borderless medium, making it difficult to apply nation-state style borders.
  - Definitions of cybercrime vary, as do the punishments.
  - Extradition of criminals is challenging on many levels.
  - Microsoft has employed bounty hunting.
  - Tapping into fan-bases, such as with Half-Life 2, can be effective.

### Extra-Territoriality and Investigations
- **Challenges:**
  - Impossible to examine all foreign packets.
  - High level of anonymity on the Web.
  - Scarcity of good log data and expertise.
  - Digital information can be quickly destroyed.
  - Evidence should be secured as soon as possible.
  - Cultural, linguistic, and political barriers.
  - Traceback involves time lags.

### FBI Sting Operation
- **2000:**
  - FBI learns of hackers cracking banks, ISPs, and other firms in the U.S.
  - Activity traced to Russia.
  - Failed to acquire Russian assistance.
  - Took unilateral action with a U.S. search warrant.
  - Invited two Russians to Seattle for “interviews.”
  - Sniffed keystrokes for usernames/passwords.
  - FBI officials never left their offices in the U.S.
  - First FBI extra-territorial seizure.

### Remote Search and Seizure
- **Inconsistencies with International Law:**
  - Reconnaissance often uses universal media for observation in other countries (binoculars, telescopes, surveillance aircraft, commercial satellites, personal interviews, mass media).
  - Network reconnaissance does not involve physical entry.
  - Invasion or picture taking?

### European Cybercrime Convention
- **Proposals:**
  - Global cybercrime task force like Interpol.
  - Opposition concerns:
    - Civil liberties (abuse of data sharing).
    - Poor relations between certain countries.
    - Big obligations on ISPs.
    - No cross-border searches, even in hot pursuit.
    - Need to consult with local officials.
    - Universal consent (safe havens).

### Future of International Law
- **Key Factors:**
  - Technological capability.
  - Legal authority (Territorial Sovereignty).
  - Willingness to Cooperate (including ability: language, cultural, and political barriers).

- **Voluntary Participants:**
  - PRC CERT: One person, and he only speaks Chinese?!
