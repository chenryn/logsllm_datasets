## Background and Related Work

The identification of wireless transmitters has been extensively studied and can be divided into two categories: channel-based and device-based methods. 

- **Channel-based methods** estimate the channel impulse response, which characterizes multipath effects [51] and attenuation [29, 70] between a transmitter and a receiver for RF fingerprinting.
- **Device-based methods** rely on the distinct radiometrics of transmitters at the waveform [33–35, 41, 57, 63] or modulation [64] levels. Wired Ethernet NICs can also be identified by analyzing their analog signals [55].

Our work is inspired by the aforementioned device fingerprinting research. Instead of focusing on wireless or wired transmitters, we concentrate on fingerprinting smartphones using the imperfections of onboard sensors.

### Privacy and Side Channel

Sensor-rich smartphones and tablets are increasingly becoming targets for attacks aimed at harvesting sensitive data [24]. Enck et al. [27, 28] demonstrated the potential misuse of users' private information through third-party applications, and Schlegel et al. [59] showed that a smartphone's microphone can be used maliciously to retrieve sensitive data.

Since Cai et al. [17] pointed out that built-in sensors (e.g., GPS, microphone, and camera) in smartphones can be used as a side channel to record user actions, several systems (e.g., TouchLogger [15], ACCessory [49], Taplogger [67]) have been developed. These systems have shown that collecting data from an accelerometer or gyroscope alone is sufficient to infer sequences of touches on a soft keyboard. Cai et al. [16] compared gyroscopes and accelerometers as a side channel for inferring numeric and soft-keyboard inputs, finding that inference based on the gyroscope is more accurate. Milluzzo et al. developed TapPrint [45], which uses both gyroscope and accelerometer readings to infer the location of tapping on tablet and smartphone keyboards. Additionally, it has been shown that accelerometer readings can be used to infer not only PINs but also Android's graphical password patterns [11].

## Conclusion

Inferring keystrokes on a regular keyboard has attracted much attention. Electromagnetic waves [65], acoustic signals [71], timing events [38], and specialized software [36] have been exploited to intercept keystrokes with high accuracy. It is also possible to infer keystrokes using the accelerometer readings from an iPhone placed two inches away from the keyboard. Instead of treating sensors as a side channel, we focus on the built-in fingerprint of a smartphone for device identification.

## Limitations and Discussion

### 1. Scalability

Accelerometer fingerprints may not need to be globally unique to pose a threat. For example, if a smartphone accelerometer in the US proves to be identical to another in Taiwan, the backend adversary may still be able to disambiguate using the device's cell tower location. Broad location, device type, and other contextual factors can relax the stringency on uniqueness. Combining additional sensors within the fingerprint, such as the gyroscope and microphone, can further increase the ability to discriminate. From crude measurements, we have observed that the gyroscope also responds to stimuli from the phone's vibration motor. For the microphone, it may be feasible to play a fixed audio file through the speakers and process the recording for the fingerprint.

### 2. Scrubbing the Fingerprint

In an attempt to scrub the fingerprint, we first computed the resting acceleration of each device, i.e., the acceleration value when the phone is completely at rest on a predefined location. Given that the resting values differ across phones, we equalized the RSS values by adding or subtracting from the signal. However, the fingerprinting accuracy did not degrade, suggesting that the uniqueness arises from a wide range of features. Equalizing across all these features is difficult. We then added 0dB white Gaussian noise to the signal, observing only a marginal drop in precision and recall (to 93%). Adding 5dB of noise sharply reduced performance, but also severely affected higher-level operations. Finally, we used a low-pass filter to eliminate high-frequency components, but this did not remove the fingerprint without affecting the application. We believe that fingerprint scrubbing requires closer investigation and will be a critical next step for AccelPrint.

### 3. Influence of Operating System Version

We used the Android operating system (Ice Cream Sandwich and Gingerbread) for all smartphones. Even with identical OS versions, the fingerprints remained discernible, implying that AccelPrint is not affected by the OS version.
