### Digital Forensics
**Definition**: "The recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices."
- **Tools and Concepts**: Used for criminal, civil, and corporate investigations.
- **Objective**: Solve a "crime."
- **Limitation**: Few forensics tools are designed specifically for penetration testers.

### Offensive Forensics
**Definition**: "The use of forensic techniques for offensive purposes, often to enhance social engineering or password cracking."
- **Why?**
  - Traditional post-exploit techniques may be insufficient.
  - Penetration testing has time constraints.
- **Objective**: Gain access to additional sensitive information.
- **Explicit vs. Implicit Sensitive Data**

### Forensic Comparison (Live/Dead Analysis)
- **Offensive Forensics**
  - **Live Analysis**
    - Remote access to memory, but file access is restricted by permissions.
    - Access to hiberfil.sys, pagefile.sys, and other OS files.
  - **Dead Analysis**
    - All files accessible through disk image.
    - Loss of potential from user interaction and live RAM.

- **Traditional Forensics**
  - **Live Analysis**
    - Can capture memory, but data is dynamic and subject to change.
    - Legal concerns and chain of custody issues.
  - **Dead Analysis**
    - System is powered off.
    - Stable environment with no ongoing changes.
    - Capture disk image.

### Offensive Forensics - Memory
- **Windows Clipboard**
- **Password Managers (copy/paste)**
- **Command-line History** (e.g., `doskey /history`)
- **Adding Users, FTP/Telnet Sessions, etc.**
- **Passwords, Key Files, Encryption Keys** (e.g., `process_memdump` in Metasploit)
- **Password/Key Cache** (e.g., TrueCrypt)
- **Older Software** (e.g., PuTTY)
- **Private Browsing/Sandboxing** (not as private as it seems)
- **Upcoming Feature**: Volatility plugin to detect Private Browsing Sessions

#### Browser Files
- **Firefox**
  - `key3.db` & `signons.sqlite` (Passwords)
  - `places.sqlite` (Bookmarks and History)
  - `cookies.sqlite` (Cookies)
  - `formhistory.sqlite` (Saved Form Data)
  - `downloads.sqlite` (Downloads)
  - `content-prefs.sqlite` (Site-specific settings)
  - `addons.sqlite` (Browser Add-ons)
  - `sessionstore.js` (Saved session for Firefox re-opening)

### Offensive Forensics - Disk/Registry
- **Browser Form History**: Credit Card Info, Account Compromise
- **Most Recently Used (MRU)**: User activity
- **Prefetch Files**: Applications run by the user
- **Deleted Files/Slack Space**: Previously stored data
  - Tools: `imager.rb`, `recover_files.rb` in Metasploit
- **Backups, Volume Shadow-Copy Service (VSS)**
  - Tools: `vss_list.rb` and related scripts in Metasploit

- **Crash Dumps**: Potential similar to live memory
- **Calendars, Address Books, Smartphone Backups, Print Spools, etc.**
  - Implicitly sensitive data (useful for spearphishing, watering holes, password cracking, etc.)

### Challenges
- **Data Overload**: Thousands of potential files and directories to search.
- **Variability**: Not all files apply to every OS, application, or version.

### Forensic_Scraper
- **Overview**: A Meterpreter script that uses OS identification to collect and download:
  - Major browser files (history, saved passwords, form data, etc.)
  - MRU lists for Windows and MS Office
  - Prefetch data (executables, time-date stamps)
  - Windows crash dumps
  - Print spools
  - Located backups (Windows, iPhone, Blackberry, etc.)

### Demo
- **Forensic_Scraper**: Simple, point-and-shoot tool
