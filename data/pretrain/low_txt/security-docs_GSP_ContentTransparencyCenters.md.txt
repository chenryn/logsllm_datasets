# Transparency Centers

Microsoft is committed to providing an unprecedented level of transparency through the Government Security Program (GSP). This program aims to help customers gain confidence in the integrity and assurance of the products and services they rely on. The Transparency Centers (TCs) serve as a prime example of Microsoft's commitment to security and transparency.

## Secure Facilities for Inspection and Analysis

Transparency Centers offer GSP participants the opportunity to visit secure facilities where they can conduct in-depth document and source code inspections and analyses. To support these efforts, Microsoft has established five Transparency Centers around the world, located in the United States, Ireland, Singapore, Brazil, and China. Participants have access to documents and source code, along with an environment equipped with industry-standard tools for in-depth inspection. Currently, the Transparency Centers provide source code for products such as **Windows, Windows Server, Office, Exchange Server, SQL Server, and SharePoint Server**.

## Center Visits

Each visit to a Transparency Center is tailored to the unique goals of the visiting agency. Visits can range from one day to two weeks, depending on the agencyâ€™s needs, and are scheduled based on facility availability. Face-to-face or teleconference exchanges with Microsoft engineers may also be available and can be particularly beneficial for agencies that have joined the Technical Data portion of the program.

## Environment and Tools

The environment and tools provided for source code evaluation include:
- A private network with dedicated servers and clients
- OpenGrok open-source search and cross-reference tool
- PowerShell and Visual Studio
- HeyRays IDA Disassembler and Decompiler
- Tools provided by the participant and approved by Microsoft
- SysInternals

## Use Cases

- **Cryptography Evaluation:** Assess the implementation of Cryptography Next Generation and prepare for national cryptography standards.
- **SSL and TCP/IP Review:** Examine the implementation of SSL and TCP/IP protocols.
- **Random Number Generator Inspection:** Inspect the source code of random number generators.
- **Build Process Walkthrough:** Understand Microsoft's build process.
