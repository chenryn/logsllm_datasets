### Service Provider Transparency and Resilience

Service providers should enhance transparency regarding the attacks they encounter and the resiliency measures they have in place. Additionally, they must be judicious and transparent in their use of third-party services, as these transitive dependencies can amplify the impact of any disruptions.

### Analyzing Third-Party Service Dependencies in Modern Web Services: Have We Learned from the Mirai-Dyn Incident?

**IMC ’20, October 27–29, 2020, Virtual Event, USA**

#### 8.3 Future Work

Several promising directions for future research include:

1. **Dependency Analysis Among Websites**: Incorporating a more detailed analysis of dependencies among websites to better understand their interconnectedness.
2. **Capacity Measurement**: Measuring the capacity of service providers to provide a clearer picture of their individual vulnerabilities.
3. **Defense Metric Design**: Developing a defense metric that utilizes these measurements to estimate the robustness of a website.
4. **Framework for Informed Decisions**: Using our framework to build a service that analyzes the complete dependency structure of a website, enabling administrators to make informed policy decisions when choosing new service providers.
5. **Service-Level Dependencies**: Extending the dependency analysis to study service-level dependencies such as payment processors, messaging platforms, and CRM systems.
6. **Case Studies**: Conducting case studies on sectors like e-commerce, education, and government to analyze their third-party dependencies.
7. **Categorization of Providers**: Enhancing our analysis with additional heuristics, such as abuse emails, to categorize third-party providers and further increase the robustness of the algorithms mentioned in Section 3.
