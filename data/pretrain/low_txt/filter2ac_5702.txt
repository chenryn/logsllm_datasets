### Title: Botconf 2018 - Stagecraft of Malicious Office Documents: An Analysis of Recent Campaigns

Malicious Office documents have emerged as a preferred method for delivering malware among cybercriminals. Over the past four years, we have observed a significant increase in the use of such documents. According to data from Zscaler Cloud Sandbox, 30% of the malware blocked since 2017 has been delivered through malicious Office documents. These documents are not only used to distribute crimeware payloads but are also frequently employed in Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks.

Over time, attackers have developed and implemented various obfuscation, encryption, and evasion techniques to evade detection by security systems. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the different methods used in these malicious documents, including obfuscation, encryption, exploits, and evasion techniques. Our study is based on an in-depth examination of over one thousand malicious documents from fifty distinct campaigns.

This research paper also catalogues the various malware samples delivered via these malicious documents, with a particular focus on the use of PowerShell and other scripting languages.
