### 6. Discussion

This work is based on the observation that spam messages typically constitute a small portion of the total messages on any social platform, making them identifiable as outliers. This principle holds true for most social platforms, where existing anti-spam mechanisms have already filtered out the majority of spam, leaving only a small fraction to be detected. This scenario is characterized by imbalanced data, which poses a significant challenge for supervised learning methods [29, 44, 52, 55]. Our goal is to address this challenge by proposing an effective unsupervised solution that can be integrated into existing anti-spam mechanisms to further filter out spam messages.

Our solution aims to mitigate the spammer feature drift problem through two key design strategies. First, we do not rely on labeled ground truth datasets for feature extraction; instead, we directly refine the spam and ham corpora in the target dataset. Second, we embed each word in the refined corpora into a high-dimensional vector, allowing it to capture a richer set of words with similar syntactic or semantic patterns. Even if spammers evolve by substituting some words with new ones, the resulting spam may still be detectable as an outlier due to its high-dimensional representation.

The current work focuses on English-based social platforms. Extending this approach to other languages, such as Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, remains an open problem for future research. Additionally, while our work targets text-only spam, there is a need to develop a platform-agnostic solution to detect malicious images on social platforms like Facebook and Instagram, where images play a significant role. This line of research will be pursued in future work.

### 7. Conclusion

This paper introduces a novel, platform-agnostic spam detection framework that effectively identifies spam across multiple social platforms by leveraging their outlier properties. By developing new methods to mine and refine spam and ham seed corpora from the target dataset, our framework avoids the need for laborious ground truth labeling and has the potential to adapt to spammer feature drift. Using NLP and neural network models, our framework can identify words with similar semantic and syntactic information without relying on feature extraction techniques used in previous supervised learning methods. The framework efficiently encodes all messages in the target dataset, enabling effective processing by outlier detection techniques. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our solution can accurately expose the outlier characteristics of the vast majority of spam messages. Furthermore, it outperforms all examined unsupervised methods and shows consistent superior performance when applied to multiple platforms.
