### 8. Conclusions

This paper introduces the Prepose language and runtime, designed to enable developers to write high-level gesture descriptions using SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) formulas. The architecture of Prepose ensures user privacy by preventing untrusted applications from directly accessing raw sensor data. Instead, applications register their Prepose code with a trusted runtime, which performs sound static analysis to eliminate potential security and reliability issues.

To evaluate the expressiveness of Prepose, we created 28 gestures across three key immersive programming domains. We demonstrated that Prepose programs can be statically analyzed quickly to check for safety, pairwise conflicts, and conflicts with system gestures. Both runtime matching and static conflict checking in Prepose are reduced to Z3 queries, achieving performance in the range of milliseconds to several seconds, making it suitable for deployment.

By designing a domain-specific language (DSL) specifically for gesture recognition with a focus on privacy, security, and reliability, we achieve strong guarantees without compromising performance or expressiveness. Our Z3-based approach has shown more than acceptable performance in practice. Specifically, pose matching in Prepose averages 4 ms, synthesizing target pose time ranges between 78 and 108 ms, and safety checking is under 0.5 seconds per gesture. The average validity checking time is 188.63 ms. For 97% of cases, conflict detection time is below 5 seconds, with only one query taking longer than 15 seconds.
