## Introduction
### The Evolution of Steganography
Steganography, the practice of hiding information within other data, has evolved significantly over the years. From simple tools designed to exploit sensory weaknesses to sophisticated methods that are resilient to statistical attacks, steganography has become a critical tool in covert communication.

#### Key Developments
- **Covert Communication**: Defined as any channel that can be exploited to transfer information in a manner that violates the system's security policy (U.S. Department of Defense, 1985).
- **Tools and Techniques**: 
  - **Simple Tools**: Exploit sensory weaknesses.
  - **JPEG Embedding**: Increased focus on JPEG files.
  - **Resilient Methods**: More robust against statistical attacks.
  - **Multimedia Stego**: Evolved into a viable method.
  - **Steganographic File Systems**: Emerged with new versions of existing algorithms.
  - **VOIP, RTP, and UDP**: New techniques and decoys to complicate detection and recovery.

### Internet Era Steganography
- **Stego Apps and Decoy Techniques**: OpenPuff, Stealth Alternate Data Streams (NT), Weaponized CnC (Operation Shady RAT).
- **Protocols**: VOIP, RTP, UDP, WiFi StegoStuffing, Bluetooth.
- **SmartWatch and MP3 Metadata**: Exploitation through Hosmer/Raggo Skytalks DC24.

### Types of Steganography
- **Text/Linguistic Stego**: Natural Language.
- **Image Stego**: Spatial (e.g., LSB), Frequency (DCT/DWT), Metadata (JPEG EXIF vs. JFIF).
- **Audio and Video Stego**: Various file types.
- **Protocols and Crypto**: Vigenere, base64, XOR, etc.

## DIY Social Steganography
### Social Network Photo Targets
- **Profile Image**
- **Background Image**
- **Posted Images**
- **Photo Albums**
- **Direct Message Images**
- **Links to Images on Other Websites**

### Carrier Image File Types
- **Lossy vs. Lossless Compression**: JPEG (Lossy), PNG (Lossless), TIFF (Lossless), GIF (Lossless), BMP (Lossless).

### Trial and Error Methods
- **Metadata Fields**: Varies by image type (JPEG EXIF vs. JFIF).
- **LSB Insertion**: Least Significant Bit.
- **Append after EOF Marker**: Linguistic Steganography.
- **Round Trip Testing**: Pre/post upload.

### High-Level Testing Workflow
- **Social Network Data Hiding Survivability Testing**.

## Deep Neural Networks for Social Stego
### Social Network Image Proliferation
- **Massive Uploads**: 100+ hours of video per minute, 4.75 billion pieces of content shared daily, 500+ million tweets, 80+ million images, 5 billion +1’s.
- **Engagement**: Image-based social networks have the fastest-growing user bases and highest daily engagement.

### Social Networks as Stego Conduits
- **Heavily Trafficked**: Tons of images, public nature, and broadcast capabilities.
- **APIs for Sharing**: Convenient for developers and apps.
- **Fake Account Creation**: Trivial and lacking indicators of compromise.
- **Wild Examples**: C&C, malware, phishing.

### Social Stego in the Wild
- **White Hat**: Instegogram (ENDGAME).
- **Black Hat**: HAMMERTOSS (FireEye), Secretbook (Owen Campbell-Moore).

### Automated High-Level Testing Workflow
- **Bulk Image Uploads/Downloads**: Permissive APIs, off-the-shelf photo aggregators, and automated uploads.

### Jamming Techniques
- **Server-Side Alterations**: Compression, lowpass filtering, metadata stripping, filetype conversion, resizing, alpha compositing.
- **Targeting Unaltered Carrier Pixels**: Analyzing pixel data to identify optimal embedding locations.

### Auto-Generating Data
- **Sample Selection**: ~50k samples (e.g., ImageNet).
- **Automated Uploads and Downloads**: Compare pixels between phases.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Proven effective for computer vision tasks, binary classification, and image segmentation.

### Prototype Evaluation
- **Robust Transmission**: Minimizes visual dissimilarity, high accuracy (94.1%), and learned pixel correlation.
- **Innovation and Novelty**: Spatial stego, data-driven approaches, and generalization across social networks.

## Data-Driven Red and Blue Teaming
### InfoSec ML Historically Prioritizes Defense
- **Time and Effort**: Data-driven social engineering, SNAP_R, spear phishing, and phishing.
- **Red Team ML Rising**: Micro-targeted social engineering, password cracking, CAPTCHA subversion, AV evasion, and steganography.
- **Defensive ML**: Semi-supervised learning, adversarial learning, transfer learning, self-supervised reinforcement learning.

### Use Cases
- **Data Exfiltration, C&C, Bypass Censors, Privacy, Piracy, Security Awareness**.

### Next Steps
- **More Social Networks, Crypto, Filters, Resizing, Fragment/Disperse Payload, Test More File Types, Video Files, Audio Files, Custom MP3s, ID3 Headers**.

### Mitigations
- **Dynamic Jamming, Histogram “Zigzag”, Statistical Analysis, Impermanence, Ephemeral Images, Steganalysis Challenges, Further Obscurement**.

## Summary and Questions
- **Social Networks and Image Hosting Services**: Can be used to transmit data covertly.
- **Steganography Automation**: Despite distorting image upload side effects.
- **Offensive AI**: Cheaper and easier to implement than defensive AI.
- **Code Release**: GitHub, followed by a technical report (WIP).
