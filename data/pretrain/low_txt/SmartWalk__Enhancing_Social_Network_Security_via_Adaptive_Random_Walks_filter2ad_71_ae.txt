### Optimized Text

The computational complexity is \(O(\Gamma(k))\), where \(\Gamma(k)\) represents the number of k-hop neighbors. We evaluated the computational overhead on a machine running a Linux 2.6.32 kernel with a 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon core. The average computational time for 3-hop features was approximately 100 milliseconds using Facebook1, 30 milliseconds using Facebook2, and 170 milliseconds using Twitter. In distributed systems, for a given node \(i\), its k-hop features can be approximated by performing a sufficiently large number of k-hop random walks from \(i\) and recording the frequency of different terminus nodes.

Random walks are inherently resilient to Sybil attacks [51, 52] because Sybil users have limited influence over the close neighborhood of honest users. However, the impact of poisoning attacks [26] on the probe method remains an open research question. Potential defenses against poisoning attacks include enhancing the robustness of training nodes through short random walks from prior trusted seeds or developing detection methods to identify potentially poisoned features and labels. Future work will explore the safe adoption of machine learning techniques in adversarial settings.

#### Random Walks in Security Systems

Danezis et al. [12] proposed Drac, a decentralized protocol for anonymous communications that leverages social links. Random walks are used in the circuit creation process. Mittal et al. [33] presented a random walk-based perturbation algorithm to anonymize social trust relationships by replacing real edges with edges between initial and terminal nodes of random walks. Many Sybil defense mechanisms, such as SybilLimit [51], SybilGuard [52], SybilRank [8], SybilInfer [13], and the Criminal Account Inference Algorithm [49], utilize random walks to detect Sybil users. Integro [5] modifies the transition probabilities associated with random walks but still uses fixed-length random walks. Using multiple real-world social network datasets, we experimentally verified the applicability of adaptive random walk models in Sybil defense, anonymous systems, and link privacy-preserving systems. Our proposal has the potential to improve the security and privacy of these applications by an order of magnitude. We note that our approach has broad potential to impact security-performance trade-offs in applications beyond social networks, including graph-theoretic detection mechanisms for P2P botnets [38], spamming botnets [53], malicious online communities [42], and malware [22].

#### Random Walks in Networked Systems

Lovász et al. [29] described the connection between mixing time and the second largest eigenvalue modulus (SLEM) of graphs. Numerous studies have experimentally investigated the impact of network topology on the mixing times of random walks [11, 37, 36]. To the best of our knowledge, all previous works use uniform-length random walks, and our work is the first to adapt the random walk length based on structural characteristics of nodes, applying this concept to enhance system security and privacy. Although our analysis was presented from the perspective of undirected graphs, our idea can be extended to both weighted and directed networks, and such a quantitative study would be an interesting direction for future work.

### 9. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we observe that in various social topologies, the walk length required to converge to stationarity exhibits a heterogeneous and long-tail property across nodes. Using a set of supervised machine learning techniques, we show that the walk length for a specific node can be well predicted given local characteristics and limited knowledge of a small set of training nodes. Based on this heterogeneous property and prediction algorithm, we propose two usage models of random walks that can adaptively change the random walk length: node-adaptive and path-adaptive random walks. Finally, we present experimental results using these two models in real-world social network-based security applications, demonstrating up to two orders of magnitude improvement in performance.

#### A. PROOF OF INEQUALITY

Given node \(i\), the probability distribution at time \(t\) is given by \(\pi_i(t) = \pi_i(0)P^t\). Assume \(t > 1\). Then, \(\pi_i(t) = \sum_{j \in N(i)} \pi_j(0)P^{t-1}\). Let \(T_{\max} = \max_{j \in N(i)} T_j(\epsilon)\). Denote the total variation distance to stationarity at time \(t\) as \(\Delta_i(t)\). For any neighboring node \(j\) of node \(i\), \(\Delta_j(T_{\max}) < \epsilon\). Thus, we have:
\[
\Delta_i(T_{\max} + 1) = \left| \pi - \sum_{j \in N(i)} \pi_j(0)P^{T_{\max}} \right|_1 \leq \frac{1}{\deg(i)} \sum_{j \in N(i)} \Delta_j(T_{\max}) < \epsilon
\]
Since \(\Delta_i(T_{\max} + 1) < \epsilon\), the local mixing time of node \(i\) must not exceed \(T_{\max} + 1\). The proof is completed.
