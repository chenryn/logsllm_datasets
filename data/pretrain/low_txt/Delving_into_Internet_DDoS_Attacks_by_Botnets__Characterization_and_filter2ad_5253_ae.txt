### Figure 20: Consecutive Attack Intervals

Figure 20 illustrates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the intervals between consecutive attacks. The figure indicates that nearly 80% of consecutive attacks occurred within 30 seconds. This finding is significant as it suggests a high level of coordination and potential intelligence behind these attacks. A longer interval would allow targets more time to deploy various defense mechanisms, which are less likely to be captured in our dataset.

### Figure 21: Consecutive Attack Magnitude

Figure 21 presents the attack magnitude of all consecutive DDoS attacks over a 28-week period. The x-axis represents the timespan of our dataset, and the y-axis lists the targets affected by these attacks. Each dot represents a single DDoS attack, with the size of each marker indicating the attack magnitude. Dots displayed consecutively in a row indicate that the attacks were launched in quick succession. Different colors represent different botnet families. We observe that the attack magnitudes of most collaborating families remain relatively stable during consecutive attacks, with the exception of Dirtjumper, which exhibits several attacks of very large magnitude.

### Summary

Intra- and inter-family collaborations in DDoS attacks may be driven by an underlying ecosystem, the evolution of botnet families, or the evolution of defense mechanisms. These factors make defending against such attacks particularly challenging. Developing defenses that leverage this insight for attack attribution, with a deep understanding of the participating hosts in each family, is essential.

### VI. Related Work

Research on the prevention and mitigation of DDoS attacks remains a critical area in the security community. Numerous studies have been conducted, and various countermeasures have been proposed. Huang et al. [16] addressed the lack of motivation for organizations to adopt cooperative solutions by fixing the incentive chain. Another approach is to disrupt the command-and-control (C&C) channel of the botnet launching the DDoS attack. However, the effectiveness of current takedown methodologies is often limited by the depth of knowledge about the specific botnet family involved. Nadji et al. [17] proposed a takedown analysis and recommendation system called rza, which not only allows postmortem analysis but also provides recommendations for future actions.

Several filtering schemes [18], [19], [20], [21], [22] have been proposed to prevent flooding packets from reaching target victims. Chen et al. [23] introduced a new defense system capable of detecting DDoS attacks across multiple network domains. Overlay-based protection systems like Secure Overlay Services [24] offer an attractive alternative, requiring minimal changes to existing network routing infrastructure and minimal collaboration from ISPs. Stavrou and Keromytis [25] proposed a novel, multiple-path overlay network that adopts a spread-spectrum-like communication paradigm to address limitations in existing overlay-based approaches.

Statistical approaches [26], [27], [28], [29] have also been applied for anomaly detection of DDoS attacks. Lee et al. [29] proposed an efficient method for proactive detection using cluster analysis. Another work [30] advocated for DDoS defense by offense, designing an application-level defense named Speak-Up, where victimized servers encourage clients to send higher volumes of traffic to attackers.

Defense mechanisms can be classified into two types based on their deployment location: at the destination (victim) or at the source of attacks. Historically, most defense systems, such as Cisco IDSM-2 [31] and Large-scale Automated DDoS Detection System [32], are deployed at the destination. Mirkovic et al. [33] proposed D-WARD, a DDoS defense system deployed at the source-end networks that autonomously detects and stops attacks originating from these networks.

Several works have focused on understanding the unique characteristics of DDoS attacks, such as their types, durations, and patterns. Wood and Stankovic [34] extracted distinct features of DDoS attacks in sensor networks, while Geng et al. [35] focused on ad hoc networks. Mirkovic et al. [36] and Specht and Lee [37] proposed taxonomies of DDoS attacks and defenses. Peng et al. [39] presented a comprehensive survey of the causes of DoS attacks and state-of-the-art mechanisms for detection and mitigation.

Measurement studies are crucial for understanding DDoS attacks and developing effective countermeasures. Mao et al. [11] conducted a study using both direct and indirect measurements, while Moore et al. [40] used backscatter analysis to estimate DoS attack activity. Rossow [41] identified protocols susceptible to amplification attacks, highlighting 14 vulnerable services. Pang et al. [9] and Wustrow et al. [10] studied Internet background radiation, while Bailey et al. [13] designed the Internet Motion Sensor (IMS) for global threat detection. Xu et al. [43] developed a methodology to build behavior profiles of Internet backbone traffic.

### VII. Conclusion

DDoS attacks are a frequent occurrence on the Internet. While many studies have focused on designing defense schemes, the measurement and analysis of large-scale DDoS attacks are less common. In this study, we characterized today's DDoS attacks from different perspectives using a large-scale dataset. Our findings provide new insights into modern DDoS attacks and will inform the development of more effective defense strategies in the future.
