#### Correlation Analysis of Vulnerable Fields
The "Location" field is weakly correlated with other fields, primarily due to the behavior of redirect checkers. These systems focus on the "Location" field and often ignore others. This behavior is further analyzed in Section 6.3.

Similarly, the "Status Message" field is used by scanning systems for availability checks, such as verifying that a website is operational.

For all other fields, there is an extremely strong correlation, confirming the security relevance of the headers under consideration. Most scanning systems report these fields, indicating that the exposure of these systems is not dependent on specific fields. If a system is vulnerable via one field, it is likely vulnerable via others.

### Application Scenarios

#### 6.1 Scan Attribution
**Nmap Online Vulnerability:**
- **Description**: Nmap Online, a web application providing Nmap functionalities, suffered from an XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact**: An injected browser can be forced to send identifying data, making network-level anonymization techniques ineffective.
- **Mitigation**: The vulnerability was fixed on March 24, 2020.

#### 6.2 Scanning Host Takeover
**Metasploit Pro Vulnerability:**
- **Description**: Metasploit Pro, a full-featured penetration testing framework, had a browser-based UI with a REST API backend.
- **Impact**: An attacker could inject commands and perform lateral movements, leading to a complete host takeover through RCE.
- **Mitigation**: The vulnerability (CVE-2020-7354 and CVE-2020-7355) was remediated on May 14, 2020, with patch 4.17.1.

#### 6.3 Enhanced Phishing
**CheckShortURL Vulnerability:**
- **Description**: CheckShortURL, a service for checking URL redirects, can be used to enhance phishing attacks.
- **Impact**: Victims can be tricked into visiting malicious URLs disguised as trusted domains.
- **Defense Mechanisms**: Reputation systems and black/white lists can help, but temporary websites may evade detection. Redirect checking services like CheckShortURL can provide additional protection.
