**ATT&CK Technique Name:** APT28

APT28, a well-known advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed retrieving internal documents from compromised machines within victim environments. One of the methods employed by APT28 involves using the `Forfiles` utility to stage these documents prior to exfiltration. This technique has been documented in multiple reports and analyses.[8][9][10][11]
