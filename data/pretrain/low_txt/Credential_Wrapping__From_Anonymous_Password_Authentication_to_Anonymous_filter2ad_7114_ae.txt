### 5.2 Experimental Results

The experiments measured two key metrics to determine the feasibility of the proposed scheme: one related to biometric performance (False Match Rate, FMR, and False Non-Match Rate, FNMR), and the other to the performance of the anonymous biometric authentication protocol. The client program was implemented as an Android app and tested on a smartphone with a 1.2 GHz CPU and 2 GB RAM. The server program was run on a PC with an Intel 3.1 GHz CPU and 8 GB RAM.

**Table 2: Experimental Results**

| Metric                  | Value (%)  | Client Performance (sec.) | Server Performance (sec.) |
|-------------------------|------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| FMR                     | 0.12       | 1.6                       | 0.12                      |
| FNMR                    | 0.8        | 2.58                      | -                         |

#### Biometric Performance
- **FMR (False Match Rate)**: For each finger, we used all other fingers' impressions against it, resulting in an FMR of 0.12%.
- **FNMR (False Non-Match Rate)**: Each finger was tested using its own other five impressions against the one used in KeyTPLGen, resulting in an FNMR of 0.8%.

In the context of our tests, "matching" or "non-matching" refers to whether the original biometric sample \( x \) used in the KeyTPLGen algorithm is recovered in the KeyRelease algorithm. These results are promising, although larger and more dynamic datasets would provide more convincing evidence. Nonetheless, these results indicate the basic feasibility of biometric wrapped credentials.

#### Computation Performance
To avoid compounding the experimental results, we did not consider communication delays, and the client and server programs were run in isolation. The client app's performance was measured separately for the time it takes to unwrap a biometric wrapped credential and the time to complete the client-side computation of the anonymous authentication protocol:
- **Unwrapping a biometric wrapped credential**: 1.6 seconds
- **Client-side computation of the anonymous authentication protocol**: 2.58 seconds

The server application took approximately 120 milliseconds to complete the server-side computation of the anonymous authentication protocol, averaged over 100 executions. These results suggest that biometric wrapped credentials have demonstrated practically acceptable performance even on mobile devices.

### 6. Conclusions

Our main contributions in this work are twofold:
1. **Improvement to Anonymous Password Authentication**: We enhanced a state-of-the-art anonymous password authentication scheme (under password-wrapped credentials) proposed at ACSAC’10, which is currently being standardized. The resulting scheme is neater, more efficient, and deployment-friendly.
2. **Extension to Biometric Wrapped Credentials**: We extended the concept of password-wrapped credentials to biometric-wrapped credentials, aiming to achieve realistic anonymous biometric authentication. As expected, biometric-wrapped credentials helped overcome the linear server-side computation bound inherent in typical biometric authentication settings.

We implemented and tested the proposed anonymous biometric authentication protocol, and the experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of anonymous biometric authentication under the auspices of biometric-wrapped credentials.
