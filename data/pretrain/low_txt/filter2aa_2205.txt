## Agenda
- Standards and Requirements
- Electro-Mechanical Locks
- Critical Infrastructure and Vulnerabilities
- Real-World Threats
- Case Study: Electronic Access Control Technology

## Standards: Mechanical Locks
### Why We Need Standards
- **Purpose**: To ensure consistent performance and security.
- **Measurement Criteria**: Limited protocols with few tests, often excluding real-world attack methods such as bumping, mechanical bypass, and knowledgeable attacks.

### Security Criteria: Standards
- **Conventional vs. High Security**:
  - **Forced Entry**: Resistance to physical attacks (e.g., UL437 and BHMA 156.30).
  - **Covert Entry**: Protection against unauthorized access (e.g., picking, decoding, master key attacks).
  - **Key Security**: Organizational and legal protections for key management.

### Forced Entry
- **UL437 and BHMA 156.30**:
  - **Resistance**: 5 minutes of forced entry.
  - **Exclusions**: Many attack methods are not covered.

### Covert Entry
- **Minimum Security Criteria** (UL437 and ANSI/BHMA 156.30):
  - **Protection**: Against certain forms of covert entry.
  - **Resistance**: 10-15 minutes against picking, decoding, and master key attacks.
  - **Bumping**: Not covered by these standards.

### Key Security
- **Organizational Protection**:
  - Duplication of keys.
  - Keys ordered by code.
- **Legal Protection**:
  - Availability of blanks.
- **Technical Security**: Not addressed by current standards.

### Categories of Locks
- **Conventional Mechanical Locks**
- **High Security Mechanical Locks**
- **Electronic Credentials**:
  - Electro-Mechanical Locks
  - Electronic Locks
  - Wired, Wireless, Data on Card

### Critical Questions
- What is security in the context of locks?
- Is it secure enough?
- What does a high-security rating mean?
- The importance of key control and key security.
- Can the lock be compromised, and how difficult is it?

### Conventional Lock Functions
- **Access Control**: Restrict who can enter.
- **Unauthorized Access Prevention**: Low to medium security, often not certified.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Picking, bumping, decoding, impressioning, master key extrapolation, mechanical bypass, and failure of key control.

### Conventional Locks: Adequate for Critical Applications?
- **Limitations**:
  - No tracking of access attempts.
  - Easy key duplication.
  - Lack of key security and master key system insecurity.
  - No evidence of breach or intelligence in the lock or key.

### Conventional vs. High Security Mechanical
- **Conventional Cylinders**:
  - Easy to pick or bump open.
  - No key control.
  - Limited forced entry resistance.
- **High Security Cylinders**:
  - Comply with UL and BHMA/ANSI standards.
  - Higher quality and tolerances.
  - Better resistance to forced and covert entry.
  - Enhanced key control.

### High Security: Increased Protection?
- **Protection of High-Value Targets**.
- **Stringent Security Requirements**.
- **Standards Compliance** (UL and BHMA/ANSI).
- **Higher Threat Level**.
- **Minimum Security Criteria**:
  - Attack times and resistance.
  - More difficult to compromise.
  - Higher key control.

### Critical Differences in High Security
- **Multiple Security Layers**.
- **Independent Points of Failure**.
- **Parallel Operation of Security Layers**.
- **Difficult to Bypass Each Layer**.

### Mechanical Locks: Design Limitations
- **One Person, One Key**.
- **No Key/User Tracking**.

- **Assa Abloy**:
  - “All of your accusations and unreasonable demands seem to stem from your mistaken or feigned belief that because a product may under certain limited circumstances be susceptible to a new form of attack, it is somehow rendered 'defective.'” (5/15/2009)

### Questions and Discussion
