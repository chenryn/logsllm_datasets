### 6. Conclusions

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of SpyProxy, an execution-based malware detection system designed to protect clients from malicious web pages, such as drive-by-download attacks. SpyProxy executes active web content in a secure virtual machine before it reaches the user's browser. By relying on the behavior of the active content, SpyProxy can detect and block zero-day attacks and previously unseen threats. To enhance performance, SpyProxy employs several optimizations, including staged content release and caching of security check results.

Our evaluation of SpyProxy demonstrates that it effectively meets its goals of safety, responsiveness, and transparency:

1. **Safety**: SpyProxy successfully detected and blocked all the threats it encountered, including those not identified by other detectors.
2. **Responsiveness**: The SpyProxy prototype adds only 600 milliseconds of latency to the start of page rendering, which is negligible for users browsing over a broadband connection.
3. **Transparency**: Our prototype integrates seamlessly into the network, and its operation is transparent to users.

### Limitations of Execution-Based Analysis

While execution-based analysis is effective, it has several limitations, including non-determinism, termination issues, and differences in the execution environment between the client and the proxy. Despite these challenges, execution-based analysis complements existing malware detection tools, contributing to a "defense in depth" security strategy. Our goal is not to create a perfect tool or replace existing ones but to add a new layer of protection to the internet security arsenal. Overall, our prototype and experiments demonstrate the feasibility and value of on-the-fly, execution-based defenses against malicious web content.
