### Appendix

#### A. Seed Expansion through Google Search

To expand our seed set, we start with our testing site and identify the first layer of parent sites \( S_1 \) leading to it. We then recursively identify sites at upper layers \( S_n \) (where \( n > 1 \)) until no new sites are discovered. For this task, we use Google Search and develop a C++ program that automates the process using Firefox. The program maintains a queue of domains to be searched, pops the first URL, queries Google, extracts all search result URLs from the top 10 pages, and saves unvisited domains back into the queue. The process terminates when the queue is empty.

Despite the potential to detect spider pool sites, the performance is poor, and the process is difficult to converge. Two main reasons contribute to this:
1. **Response Time**: Google's response time to web requests is slow, and occasionally, CAPTCHA must be solved.
2. **Irrelevant Results**: The returned search results often include irrelevant sites, such as those providing domain registration information and fake search engines that copy results from other search engines. These irrelevant sites must be excluded; otherwise, the iterations will be inaccurate and may not converge. Simple filtering metrics like domain ranking and URL patterns are not effective based on our testing.

#### B. Classifications of SEO Domains

We identified three methods of linking customer content to SEO pages:
1. **Through iFrame**: Instead of pointing to the customer's site, the SEO page encloses the customer's page in an HTML iFrame. This method leverages JavaScript API `document.write` to inject the iFrame, which occupies the entire screen when the user lands on the site, potentially increasing traffic to the customer's site.
2. **Through Hyperlink**: A hyperlink pointing to the customer's site or containing the customer's message is displayed on the SEO page. This type is also used in SSPs we infiltrated.
3. **Through Redirection**: For this method, a visit to the SEO page using certain user-agent strings (e.g., Opera browser) is immediately redirected to the customer's site via HTTP 302 redirect. The redirection uses JavaScript code to assign the customer's URL to `window.top.location.href` and the HTML meta refresh tag to redirect the visitor's browser.

#### C. Topics of Customer Sites

The 930 customer sites are classified into seven categories:
1. **Sales and Services**: Includes industrial equipment and products, such as elevators and seamless pipes, as well as services in gray areas, like private detectives and empty invoices.
2. **Gambling**: Sites for online casinos and sports betting.
3. **Surrogacy**: Channels for infertile parents to find women willing to carry pregnancy.
4. **News**: News portals about local events.
5. **Sex**: Sites hosting adult content like porn videos and photos, or listing contacts of affiliated prostitutes or their agents.
6. **Games**: Online games developed by less-known companies, including unauthorized servers for big-brand games, allowing free or low-cost play.
7. **Hospitals and Drugs**: Sites introducing hospitals without valid licenses and selling illegal drugs, such as hallucinogens.

#### D. Classifications of Customer Messages

We analyzed customer messages, extracted QQ numbers, and sorted them by the number of associated URLs. The results are shown in Table 9.

#### E. Impact on Search Engines

We sampled 43 long-tail keywords from the SEO pages crawled from the 21 spider pools and searched them in Google and Baidu. The results, showing the percentage of search results containing spider pool domains, are presented in Table 10. If no search results were returned, we noted "no search result." If no spider pool domains were present in the search results, we noted "no keyword."
