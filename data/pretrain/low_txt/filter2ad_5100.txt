## Abstract
Cloud computing is a dominant trend in the computing landscape and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. Major cloud operators are now estimated to house over a million machines each and host a significant (and growing) portion of our IT and web infrastructure. The ACM Cloud Computing Security Workshop (CCSW) serves as a platform for researchers and practitioners to discuss the security implications of this trend for cloud operators, tenants, and the broader Internet community. CCSW welcomes submissions on new threats, countermeasures, and opportunities brought about by the move to cloud computing, with a preference for unconventional approaches, as well as measurement studies and case studies that shed light on the security implications of clouds.

### Topics of Interest
- Cost and usability models and their interaction with cloud security
- Scalability of secure clouds
- Trusted computing technology and clouds
- Analysis of software for remote attestation and cloud protection
- Network security (DoS, IDS, etc.) mechanisms for clouds
- Security for cloud programming models

CCSW is also open to novel paradigms and controversial ideas that may not be listed above.
