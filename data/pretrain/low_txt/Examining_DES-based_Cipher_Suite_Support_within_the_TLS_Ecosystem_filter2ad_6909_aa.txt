## Abstract
In July 2018, over a decade after the Data Encryption Standard (DES) was retired, 3DES was also officially deprecated. Previous studies suggest that DES usage in SSL/TLS handshakes had declined to less than 1% by 2018. However, these studies often have limited scope and may not fully capture the persistence of DES across the entire TLS ecosystem. In this paper, we actively investigate online support for DES and DES-derivative ciphers by querying IP addresses responsive to port 443 connection attempts. We designed and implemented an Internet scanning tool built upon ZMap to negotiate handshakes exclusively using DES ciphers. Our scans of over 31 million unique IP addresses revealed that nearly half of them can still establish an HTTPS connection using at least one DES cipher. Additionally, many servers still support DES40 (which can be broken in seconds) and anonymous ciphers (which offer no certificate verification and are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks). Our findings highlight the biases and misunderstandings in previous weak cipher studies and underscore the severity of the problem with DES-based cipher suites.

## Introduction
Secure communication on the Internet has become a critical focus. Recent initiatives, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s "HTTPS Everywhere" and browser features highlighting non-TLS connections, have driven the increased use of TLS. The Data Encryption Standard (DES) was introduced by NIST in 1977 but was publicly broken in 1997 and deprecated in 2004. Triple DES (3DES) was recommended as a replacement but was also deprecated in 2018 due to increasing attack strengths.

Recent studies suggest that DES and its variants (including 3DES) are used in fewer than 0.3% of connections. However, these studies typically connect using the most secure ciphersuite offered by the client, which may not reflect the full range of ciphersuites supported by the server. This means that a server supporting modern ciphersuites might also allow connections over insecure ciphersuites like DES.

In this work, we perform an in-depth examination of DES and its variants' support across the Internet. We scanned over 31 million IP addresses and found that 40.5% of them support one or more of the 36 DES-based ciphersuite families, including the entirely insecure DES40 cipher.

Our contributions include:
- **Active IPv4 Measurement:** We query each IPv4 address with explicitly defined DES ciphers to determine existing support.
- **Analysis of Hosts:** We examine host names to reconcile multiple unique IPs to a single organization when possible.
- **Geographic Prevalence:** We provide a global representation of DES support by city and country.

## Background
### DES-based Ciphers
We distinguish between the 56-bit DES cipher (DES56) and the family of related encryption algorithms (DES). DES56, adopted by NIST in 1977, is a symmetric-key block cipher with a 56-bit key. Due to its short key length, DES56 is vulnerable to brute-force attacks and was cracked in 1997. NIST withdrew DES56 in 2005 and recommended 3DES, which applies the DES algorithm three times with a maximum key length of 168 bits. 3DES was also deprecated in 2018 due to theoretical attacks. DES40, a 40-bit variant, is even more susceptible to brute-force attacks and can be broken in seconds.

### TLS
TLS has been the de facto protocol for secure network communication since 1999. While TLS supports newer encryption protocols like AES, it can still connect with clients using older ciphers like 3DES. DES40 is supported up to TLS 1.0, DES56 up to TLS 1.1, and 3DES up to TLS 1.2. Despite deprecation, many servers continue to support these ciphers.

### Scanning for TLS Servers
Scanning for TLS-enabled servers can be done passively or actively. Passive approaches, like the ICSI SSL Notary, collect TLS handshake metadata. Active approaches, like ZMap and ZGrab, initiate handshakes and record results. While ZGrab defaults to negotiating with the strongest available cipher, our approach requires a new method to capture the diversity of DES use.

## Design & Implementation
Active data collection requires more computational overhead than passive methods. We downloaded lists of millions of IPv4 addresses from Censys via Google's BigQuery and split them into smaller partitions. We built a multi-threaded Java program to handle these lists, creating child threads to query each IP address for all 36 DES ciphers. After receiving responses, we analyzed the data to determine DES support.

## Conclusion
Our investigation reveals that a significant number of servers still support DES-based ciphers, despite their deprecation. This highlights the need for continued vigilance and active monitoring to ensure the security of the TLS ecosystem.
