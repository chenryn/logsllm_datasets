# Privacy in DSRC-Connected Vehicles
## Defcon 21 â€“ August 3, 2013

### About the Presenter
- **Education and Experience:**
  - BSEE in Digital Communications
  - Many years as a network engineer
  - Current law student at Santa Clara University
  - Research assistant providing technical expertise on privacy audits and reviews
  - Contracted by an automotive consortium to review the privacy of a proposed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) safety network

### Standard Disclaimer
- I am not a lawyer (yet).

### Non-Standard Disclaimer
- A current NDA covers some of my work here, but not very much.
- The focus will be on published information and standards.

## Project Overview
### What is This Project?
- **DSRC (Dedicated Short-Range Communications):**
  - Communication range: approximately 380 meters
  - Multi-channel protocol (focusing on the safety channel)
  - Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication
  - Example use case: No more waiting for a light on an empty street

### Will it Maintain Privacy?
- **Privacy Concerns:**
  - Probably not, but it could with improvements
  - Developed primarily for functionality
  - Limited privacy and security reviews
  - More public relations emphasis on giving up privacy

### Why is It Being Developed?
- **Safety:**
  - World Health Organization estimates that 25% of vehicle deaths each year can be prevented
  - Reduction in accidents due to fatigue, distracted driving, blind corners, fog, and limited visibility

### Will This Really Happen?
- **Current Status:**
  - Large-scale functional tests are complete
  - Hardware is already being shipped
  - National Transportation Safety Board has mandated its use
  - Already deployed in trucks in Europe

## DSRC Details
### Basic Functionality
- **Basic Safety Messages:**
  - Sent out every 1/10 seconds
  - Include predefined vehicle trajectory and operational data
  - Cars process this data and warn drivers
  - Equipment is integrated into vehicles

### Aftermarket Installation
- **Challenges:**
  - Somewhat cumbersome

### What DSRC is Not
- **Not CANbus, OnStar, or Direct Support for Autonomous Driving:**

### Technical Details
- **Radio Protocol:**
  - 5.9GHz frequency band reserved in the US and Europe
  - Signaling standard: IEEE 802.11p / 1609.4 / 1609.3
  - Channels reserved for specific functions
  - No source address required for vehicles
  - Recommendations include using certificates
  - Privacy challenges at each layer

- **Basic Safety Message (BSM):**
  - Standard: SAE J2735
  - ~50 fixed data elements
  - Only interface to the radio on this channel/band

- **Parameters for Effectiveness:**
  - Density
  - Benefit derived from other vehicles' use
  - Greater usage means greater effectiveness
  - Trust and confidence in messages

- **Validity:**
  - All messages are cryptographically signed
  - Signing certificates issued by a central authority
  - Issued based on system fingerprint
  - Revocation for malfunctioning equipment
  - System should invalidate itself if internal checks fail

### Certificates
- **Privacy Considerations:**
  - Limited time use to prevent tracking
  - Periodically refreshed (malefactors reported)
  - How often?
  - Permanent blacklist

- **MAC Layer:**
  - Changeable source (for vehicles) / no destination
  - Unrouteable (mostly)
  - No significant privacy concern as is
  - Any algorithm to make the network routeable will make vehicles trackable

- **BSM:**
  - "Temporary" ID could become persistent with bad applications
  - Open-source apps suggested for processing and acting on message data

- **Fingerprints:**
  - No correspondence between fingerprint and car
  - Hard-coded into the device
  - If revoked, the entire unit must be replaced

### Certificate Delivery
- **Challenges:**
  - Not yet figured out how certificates are delivered to vehicles
  - Proposals include cellular, Wi-Fi, and infrastructure links
  - Many opportunities for failure

### Worrisome Noise
- **Commercial Applications:**
  - Manufacturers want to use the system for commercial apps
  - Advertising and other "funding" schemes to pay for the CA
  - Fixed infrastructure potentially operated by data brokers

### Law Enforcement
- **Potential Issues:**
  - Correlation of location and speed with independent identification (e.g., cameras)

### What You Can Do
- **Engagement:**
  - Hack the radios (commercially available now)
  - Hack the protocols (dataset available at www.its-rde.net)
  - Become politically engaged
  - Help find a way to fund the infrastructure without selling out
