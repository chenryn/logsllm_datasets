## Abstract
Despite the rapid evolution of large-scale computing and cloud-like deployments, the future of these infrastructures remains uncertain. One thing is clear: clouds present new, untested deployment models, adversarial threats, and vulnerabilities, leading to a distinct threat landscape. It is crucial for the research community to engage in shaping the future security of cloud computing. The CCSW workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to address all aspects of security and privacy in cloud-centric and outsourced computing.

## 1. Introduction
Cloud computing is the fastest-growing trend in large-scale industry. However, it also introduces a new set of security and privacy challenges that differ from traditional computing paradigms. The CCSW workshop has significantly impacted the research community and serves as a catalyst for new ideas in cloud computing security and privacy.

### Key Security and Privacy Challenges
- **Secure Virtualization**: Cloud infrastructures heavily rely on virtualization and co-location to increase resource utilization. Multi-tenancy, where multiple clients share resources such as processors, operating systems, or databases, is a core concept in cloud computing. To achieve similar levels of security as traditional computing, separation controls must be in place. If one tenant can access another tenant's data, it introduces significant security risks. Information flow policies, such as mandatory access control, are common controls to mitigate these risks.
  
- **Integrity Verification**: When computation is outsourced, ensuring the trustworthiness of the results is critical. Techniques like verifiable computation have gained interest due to their ability to reduce verification time. Verifying storage and retrieval results is also important, as it may not be feasible to retrieve all stored data. Proofs of retrievability and provable data possession allow clients to check if the cloud service provider stores the entire data with minimal local storage.

- **Computing on Encrypted Data**: Confidentiality is another major concern in cloud computing. The ideal scenario is to perform computations on encrypted data without decryption. Fully homomorphic encryption promises this but is currently impractical due to performance issues. Multi-party secure computation, while faster, requires splitting the computation among multiple, mutually distrustful parties. Industrial solutions like tokenization and deterministic encryption offer a compromise, requiring minimal changes to existing applications but with debatable security. Symmetric searchable encryption provides a stronger security model with acceptable performance.

These topics provide a glimpse into the security and privacy issues discussed at the CCSW workshop.

## 2. Scope and Objectives

## 3. Program
The 2015 ACM Cloud Computing Security Workshop (CCSW 2015) was held on October 16, 2015, in Denver, Colorado, USA, in conjunction with the 22nd ACM CCS Conference. We received twenty-one high-quality submissions, and six were selected through a rigorous review process. The program included three keynote talks by:
- Mike Reiter (University of North Carolina, USA)
- Chenxi Wang (Ciphercloud, USA)
- Bruce Grenfell (Concur / SAP, USA)
