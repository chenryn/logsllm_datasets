### Box in the Last Round of the DES Algorithm

In our experiment, we randomly selected 200 power traces from a total of 5000 and repeated this operation 200 times. The first-order success rate was approximately 0.74. For subsequent experiments, we used only the first 200 power traces from this set.

Next, we randomly selected 140 power traces from the 200 and repeated the operation 400 times using Algorithm 2. The success rate for this operation was about 28%.

### Correlation Coefficients Analysis

The correlation coefficients for the 14000th to 16000th time samples when performing traditional Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) with 4000 power traces are shown in Figure 9.

We set the parameter \( k \) to 2000, ensuring all time samples were within the time sample threshold. We then analyzed the distribution of correlation coefficients corresponding to the correct key and divided them into three thresholds: greater than 0.2, greater than 0.3, and greater than 0.35. We calculated the average number of time samples for each threshold \( k = TH \). The resulting correlation coefficient thresholds were 21, 71, and 218, as shown in Figure 10.

### Frequency of Interesting Points

The frequency of each interesting point is illustrated in Figure 11. The extracted time samples are located in regions with high correlation coefficients, indicating that our SIP-CPA accurately extracts these points. The accuracy of the frequency-based interesting points selection can be improved by appropriately increasing the threshold \( k \).

Figure 12 shows the sorted frequencies of all interesting points. The number of interesting points with the highest frequencies is 1, 6, and 49 for correlation coefficient thresholds of 21, 71, and 218, respectively. The total number of successful repetitions was 104, with corresponding frequencies of 85, 103, and 104, respectively. These interesting points may not be in the same clock cycle, but their mean correlation coefficients can still be used for SIP-CPA.

### Impact on Success Rate

We used the first 200 power traces from a total of 5000. The selected power traces may affect the success rate (SR) of our experiment. However, if we randomly choose 120 power traces from a total of 5000 and repeat this operation 200 times, the success rate SR satisfies \( < 0.06 \). Thus, the success rates of these two types of experiments are nearly identical.

Using the interesting points with the highest frequencies from Figure 12, we performed SIP-CPA. The first-order success rates with different numbers of power traces are shown in Figure 13. With 200 power traces, the first-order success rate is about 0.74. To achieve a success rate of 0.74, our SIP-CPA requires only about 85 power traces, saving approximately 57.5% of the power traces. Our SIP-CPA achieves a success rate of about 99% with 140 power traces, while the success rate is only about 30% with an average of 140 power traces.

### Guessing Entropy

The average guessing entropy of CPA is 32.65 with 10 power traces, as shown in Figure 14. The guessing entropy of our SIP-CPA is 21.41, 23.38, and 23.89, respectively, with the same number of power traces. As the number of power traces increases, the guessing entropy of CPA decreases slowly. With 60 power traces, the guessing entropy of CPA drops to 20.7, while the guessing entropy of our SIP-CPA drops to about 4.23 for correlation coefficient thresholds of 21, 71, or 218. When 140 power traces are used, the guessing entropy of CPA is 6.42, and the guessing entropy of our SIP-CPA is less than 6 with more than 50 power traces.

Both the success rate and guessing entropy of our SIP-CPA are very similar under the three correlation coefficient thresholds of 21, 71, and 218. The success rate does not significantly increase with a larger threshold \( k \). Attackers can use fewer interesting points to achieve the same success rate.

### Conclusion

From our experiments on AES implemented on an AT 89S52 single chip and DES on SASEBO, we conclude that our SIP-CPA significantly improves the efficiency of traditional CPA.
