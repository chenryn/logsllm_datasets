**Question:**
In Windows 10, which of the following security features would provide the best protection against a malicious application attempting to tamper with the memory space of a trusted application, and what is a potential drawback of this security measure?

**Options:**

- **A:** "SMB signing and mutual authentication for SYSVOL and NETLOGON shares – May prevent legitimate scripts from processing domain-based Group Policy if misconfigured."
- **B:** "Universal Windows apps running in an AppContainer sandbox – May limit the app's functionality due to restricted system-level access."
- **C:** "Protected Processes feature – May interfere with the performance of the system due to the extra validation required."
- **D:** "Heap allocation randomization – May cause compatibility issues with legacy applications expecting static memory allocation."

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
The Protected Processes feature in Windows 10 provides robust protection against a malicious application attempting to tamper with the memory space of a trusted application. This feature isolates critical processes, making it difficult for unauthorized code to manipulate their memory. However, a potential drawback is that the additional validation required for protected processes can introduce performance overhead, potentially slowing down the system.
