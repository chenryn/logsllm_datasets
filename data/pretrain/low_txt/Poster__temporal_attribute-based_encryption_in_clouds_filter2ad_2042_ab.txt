### Characteristics and Related Secret Trademark Keys
Characteristics, along with their corresponding secret trademark keys, are used to depict certain properties [4].

### Access Control Methodology
The access control methodology is characterized by a Boolean formula over these characteristics. The system ensures that only users whose attributes satisfy the access control policy can decrypt the ciphertext using their respective secret keys [5].

### Scheme Resistance Property
The system must also satisfy a collusion resistance property: it should be infeasible for a group of users to pool their attribute keys in such a way that they can decrypt a ciphertext that they could not decrypt individually [6].

### Alternative Transformation-Based Solutions
There are several other transformation-based solutions available, such as HNT Transformation [7], Bayes Network and HMM [8], and a hop-by-hop framework for authentication [9]. These security and authentication mechanisms can also be applied in various domains, such as in [10].

### Problem Statement
The proposed ABE (Attribute-Based Encryption) scheme with outsourced decryption aims to offload all decryption overhead from the users. In this system, a user provides an entrusted server, such as a cloud service provider, with a transformation key that allows the cloud to decrypt any ABE-encrypted data. This ensures that the data can only be accessed by users whose attributes match the specified parameters.

### User Access Privilege
Each user's access privilege must align with their attributes to ensure that the correct data is provided to the right users. This implies that every data access must adhere to the defined access control policies; otherwise, it could lead to unauthorized data exposure.

### Result Analysis
To implement the system, both hardware and software resources are required. This section lists the desired resources and their specific details. Additionally, it includes the reconfiguration parameters and the implemented system conditions. This part of the document provides insights into the implementation and its requirements. The previously discussed analysis and design of the required system are summarized here.

### Key Generation Policy & ABE
**Input Test Set for User 1 (Isolation & Encryption using ABE):**
- **Environment Variable Conditions:**
  - File Size: between 10KB to 100KB
- **Key 1 (Credential & Timestamp):**
  - `(harsh)XOR(123456789)XOR(Current Timestamp)`
- **Key 2 (Login Failed Attempt (LFA)):**
  - `2`
- **Key 3 (Type of File Access (TFA)):**
  - `(doc, txt, xls, jpeg, bmp)` (ID Values XORed)
- **Key 4 (Services):**
  - `(Chat, Calculator, Contact, File sharing, Map, Data Storage)` (ID Values XORed)

### Conclusions
The proposed key-based solution introduces a new feature: controlled end-user security, which, to the best of our knowledge, is not present in any previous key-based schemes. This feature allows the user to manage their own security, regardless of the system on which they operate. For example, if Alice needs to secure a file, she can use a key that only she can decrypt, provided she has the necessary attributes.

Data is a critical asset for individuals, businesses, and social and health information, often shared based on time and need. The lack of preparation time and resource constraints often leads to storing data with third-party cloud providers rather than using local resources. However, there are significant security concerns, as data may be exposed to unauthorized parties. To ensure user control over access to their own data, it is a promising strategy to make the data obfuscated and non-interpretable [11].
