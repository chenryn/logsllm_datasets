### Analysis of Price Discrimination and Personalization in E-Commerce

To analyze potential discrimination, we compare the average price differences relative to a control. In all figures presented in this section, the starred (*) feature in the key represents the control. For instance, in Figure 6, the control is a PhantomJS instance without a user account. Each data point is an average of the given metric across 20 queries on that day.

Our analysis generated over 360 plots for various features across 16 e-commerce sites. Overall, most experiments did not reveal evidence of steering or discrimination. Therefore, we focus on specific features and sites where personalization was observed. None of our tests revealed personalization on rental car sites, so they are omitted from further discussion.

### 5.2 Hotels

#### Cheaptickets and Orbitz

We begin by examining personalization on hotel sites. Cheaptickets and Orbitz, which are owned by the same company and use the same HTML structure and server-side logic, personalize hotel results based on user accounts. Figures 6(a) and (b) show that logged-in users receive slightly different sets of results compared to users without accounts or those who do not store cookies. Specifically, out of 25 results per page, approximately 2 are new and 1 is moved to a different location on average for logged-in users. In some cases, such as hotels in Bangkok and Montreal, the differences can be much larger, with up to 11 new and 11 moved results. However, the nDCG analysis in Figure 6(c) indicates that these alterations do not significantly impact the prices of highly-ranked search results.

Figure 6(d) reveals that logged-in users receive different prices on approximately 5% of hotels. As shown in Figure 6(e), the hotels with inconsistent prices are $12 cheaper on average for logged-in users. This demonstrates that Cheaptickets and Orbitz implement price discrimination in favor of users with accounts. Manual examination shows that these sites offer "Members Only" price reductions on certain hotels to logged-in users, as illustrated in Figure 7.

Although it is common for e-commerce sites to offer deals to members, our findings on Cheaptickets and Orbitz are significant for several reasons. First, while members-only prices may be an accepted practice, it still qualifies as price discrimination based on direct segmentation. Second, our methodology effectively identifies price discrimination through automated probes. Finally, our results reveal the actual price differences offered to members, which may not otherwise be public information.

#### Hotels.com and Expedia

Our analysis shows that Hotels.com and Expedia use the same personalization strategy: randomized A/B testing on users. We focus on Expedia, omitting details for Hotels.com.

Initially, we noticed that the search results for the control and its twin never matched. Additionally, the control results matched the results received by other specific treatments, and these matches were consistent over time. This led us to suspect that Expedia randomly assigns each treatment to a "bucket." Table 4, showing the Jaccard Index for 12 pairs of feature experiments on Expedia, confirms this. The perfect overlaps occur between random pairs of tests, suggesting that tests with perfect overlap have been assigned to the same bucket. We identified three buckets: 1) {Windows 7, account control, no account, logged-in, IE 8, Chrome}, 2) {XP, Linux, OS X, browser control, Firefox}, and 3) {OS control}.

To confirm our suspicion, we examined the behavior of the experimental treatment that clears its cookies after every query. Figure 8 shows the Jaccard overlap between search results received by the clear cookie treatment and results from other buckets. The clear cookie treatment is randomly assigned to a new bucket on each request, confirming that Expedia assigns users to buckets based on cookies.

Figure 9 presents the results of our analysis, using an account from bucket 1 as the control. Two conclusions can be drawn: first, users are periodically shuffled into different buckets. Second, Expedia steers users in some buckets towards more expensive hotels. Users in bucket 3 see >60% different search results compared to users in other buckets, and results served to users in buckets 1 and 2 have higher nDCG values, indicating higher-priced hotels at the top of the page. We did not observe price discrimination on Expedia or Hotels.com.

#### Priceline

Priceline alters hotel search results based on the user's history of clicks and purchases. Figures 10(a) and (b) show that users who clicked on or reserved low-price hotel rooms receive slightly different results in a different order compared to users who click on nothing or click/reserve expensive hotel rooms. The nDCG results in Figure 10(c) confirm that the reordering is not correlated with prices. Although account history impacts search results on Priceline, we cannot classify the changes as steering. We also found no evidence of price discrimination based on account history.

#### Travelocity

Travelocity alters hotel search results for users browsing from iOS devices. Figures 11(a) and (b) show that users browsing with Safari on iOS receive slightly different hotels and in a different order compared to users browsing from Chrome on Android, Safari on OS X, or other desktop browsers. Figure 11(c) shows that this reordering does not result in price steering, but Figures 11(d) and (e) indicate that Travelocity modifies prices for iOS users. Prices fall by ≈$15 on ≈5% of hotels for iOS users. This suggests price discrimination in favor of iOS users on Travelocity.

### 5.3 General Retailers

#### Home Depot

Among the 10 general retail sites we examined, only Home Depot showed evidence of personalization. Similar to our findings on Travelocity, Home Depot personalizes results for users with mobile browsers. The Home Depot website serves HTML with different structure and CSS to desktop browsers, Safari on iOS, and Chrome on Android.

Figure 12 depicts the results of our browser experiments on Home Depot. Home Depot serves 24 search results per page to desktop and Android browsers, but 48 to iOS. On most days, there is close to zero overlap between the results served to desktop and mobile browsers. The pool of results served to mobile browsers contains more expensive products overall, leading to higher nDCG scores for mobile browsers. Home Depot also discriminates against Android users, with the Android treatment consistently seeing differences on ≈6% of prices, though the practical impact is low, with an average price differential of ≈$0.41.

While the differences on Home Depot may be due to different server-side implementations for desktop and mobile users, they still qualify as personalization according to our definition, as the differences are deterministic and triggered by client-side state.
