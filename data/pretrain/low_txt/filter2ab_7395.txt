Cloud service providers often support IP-based restrictions to control access to cloud resources. To enhance security, consider implementing IP allowlisting in conjunction with robust user account management. This approach ensures that data access is restricted not only to authorized users but also to specific, expected IP ranges. By doing so, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized access using stolen credentials.
