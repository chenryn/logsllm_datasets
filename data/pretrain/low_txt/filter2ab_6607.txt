### Title: BlackHat US-19: Firmware Cartography - Charting the Course for Modern Server Compromise

**Abstract:**

Modern servers are akin to a Matryoshka doll, with layers of nested, often undocumented, components. These undocumented devices reside at unknown addresses, on buses, and in protocols that most server owners are unaware of. While these components and their secrets may seem hidden, they can be uncovered with the right approach.

In this talk, we will present our methodology for identifying vulnerabilities in undocumented server components by mapping the paths within binary firmware images. By tracing the interactions between software, hardware, and everything in-between, we expose the often permeable or non-existent security controls that attempt to prevent access to these components.

We will also demonstrate how to use Proof-of-Concept (PoC) helper libraries and chain useful primitives together, enabling you to explore these new worlds. In addition to uncovering new vulnerabilities, we will share case studies of publicly known vulnerabilities discovered by us and others, highlighting what makes them unique or common, and providing unreleased exploitation details.

Furthermore, we will release initial versions of Binary Ninja plugins developed at Atredis Partners, which bring UEFI coverage to the platform and its advanced Medium-Level Intermediate Language (MLIL). If possible, we may also disclose some new bugs or useful post-exploitation details.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Methodology for vulnerability hunting in undocumented server components
- Techniques for mapping and analyzing binary firmware images
- Case studies of public vulnerabilities and their unique characteristics
- Introduction to PoC helper libraries and primitive chaining
- Release of Binary Ninja plugins for UEFI coverage
- Potential disclosure of new bugs and post-exploitation details

Join us as we chart the course for modern server compromise and reveal the hidden world within your server's firmware.
