## Abstract
Android, as an open platform, dominates the booming mobile market. However, its permission mechanism is inflexible and often results in over-privileged applications, leading to significant security issues. To support the Principle of Least Privilege (PLP), we propose and implement a Dynamic Role-Based Access Control for Android (DR BACA) model to enhance Android security, particularly in corporate environments. Our system offers multi-user management on Android devices, comparable to traditional workstations, and provides fine-grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) at both the application and permission levels. Additionally, by leveraging context-aware capabilities and Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, our solution supports dynamic RBAC, providing more flexible access control while mitigating serious security risks. The DR BACA system is easily manageable, even in large business environments with many mobile devices. Our evaluation shows that DR BACA can effectively mitigate security risks posed by both malicious and vulnerable non-malicious applications with minimal system overhead.

## 1. Introduction
Mobile devices, particularly those running the Android operating system, have become pervasive and have changed the traditional IT environment in enterprises. With the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) trend, mobile devices are widely deployed in corporations. According to Gartner, smartphone sales increased by 47% in 2012, with Android-based smartphones accounting for 72.4% of total mobile device sales. However, the malware community has also targeted these devices, with mobile malware increasing by 700% since 2011, with 85% of attacks targeting Android smartphones, as reported by McAfee.

The popularity and openness of the Android platform contribute to the rise in malware. Android's permission model, which aims to provide better security for sensitive resources and functions, is inflexible and often results in over-privileged applications. This "install-time all or nothing" mechanism leaves many applications vulnerable. Malicious applications can exploit dangerous permissions, such as sending SMS to premium numbers, or launch permission re-delegation attacks. Over-privileged applications can inadvertently execute malicious code, violating the Principle of Least Privilege (PLP).

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a widely used approach in enterprises to support PLP by restricting resource access based on user roles. While RBAC has been implemented in various systems, its application to mobile systems like Android remains an open issue. We propose and implement a Dynamic Role-Based Access Control for Android (DR BACA) model to extend the current Android permission model. DR BACA enhances the Android system with the following capabilities:

- **Multi-User Management:** DR BACA offers multi-user functionality, allowing different users to share a single Android device without interference. It also enables a single user to seamlessly use different devices, ensuring uniform access control based on an organization-level security policy.
- **Static RBAC at Application and Permission Levels:** DR BACA provides fine-grained access control at both the application and permission levels, supporting PLP and mitigating the risk of malicious applications executing sensitive functions and reducing the risk of permission re-delegation attacks.
- **Dynamic RBAC with Flexibility:** DR BACA leverages the unique context-aware capabilities of mobile devices and NFC technology to offer more flexible fine-grained access control.
- **Simple Management:** DR BACA provides easy configuration and management options, especially for large corporate environments, by distributing a uniform security policy to all involved devices.

## 2. Android Security Issues
Android was designed with security in mind, with each application running in its own sandbox environment. Applications communicate through controlled interprocess communication channels, and the permission model protects sensitive resources and functions. During installation, users are asked to accept all requested permissions, resulting in over-privileged applications. Two possible attacks due to over-privileged applications include:

- **Granted Permission to Malicious Application:** Malicious applications trick users into accepting dangerous permissions, such as SEND SMS, to send messages to premium numbers or collect sensitive information.
- **Permission Re-Delegation (PRD) Attack:** A malicious application delegates a permission request to another application, which may not properly check the permissions of the requesting application, leading to stealthy malware.

## 3. DR BACA Model
To mitigate over-privileged applications, we propose a Dynamic Role-Based Access Control for Android (DR BACA) model. Figure 1 illustrates the basic elements of the DR BACA model and their associations. DR BACA enables multiple users to share mobile devices, with users assigned to roles. These roles are associated with privileges defined by a set of rules, extending Android's permission model with a static RBAC model for fine-grained access control.

### Multi-User Enabled
While current mobile devices are primarily designed for single users, the increasing computational power and business uses suggest that multi-user capabilities will become essential. Android version 4.2 introduced a feature for managing different users on the same device. In a corporate environment, such as a hospital, multi-user management can be particularly useful, allowing a single device to be shared by different employees and enabling a user to use different devices.

### Static Role-Based Access Control
In a traditional RBAC system, users are assigned roles, and role hierarchy can be applied in DR BACA. Instead of directly associating roles with permissions, DR BACA introduces an additional layer called rules. A rule is defined as a 6-tuple (ruleLabel, allowed, shareable, P, A, C):

- **ruleLabel:** Unique name of the rule.
- **allowed:** Flag indicating if the rule is granting (T) or denying (F).
- **shareable:** Flag indicating if the rule is shareable (T or F).
- **P:** Set of permissions {p1, p2, ..., pn} assigned to the rule.
- **A:** Set of applications {a1, a2, ..., an} assigned to the rule.
- **C:** Context set {c1, c2, ..., cn} assigned to the rule.

Rules allow DR BACA to define both static and dynamic access control. By associating rules with both applications and permissions, DR BACA provides fine-grained access control at both levels. The allowed flag determines whether the rule permits or forbids the execution or permission request. Table 2 shows the possible combinations of permissions and applications in a rule.

### Dynamic Role-Based Access Control
One drawback of static RBAC is its inflexibility. DR BACA addresses this by introducing dynamic RBAC, which leverages context-aware capabilities and NFC technology to provide more flexible access control. This allows for real-time adjustments to access control policies based on the current context, such as location, time, and user activity.
