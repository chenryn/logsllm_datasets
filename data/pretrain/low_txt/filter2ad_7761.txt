## Introduction

The vision of mobile and ubiquitous systems is becoming a reality, driven by advancements in wireless communication and device miniaturization. However, the widespread industrial adoption of these systems is still hindered by the highly error-prone and heterogeneous nature of mobile provisioning environments, which can lead to several operational impairments. Therefore, improving the dependability of these systems remains an open challenge.

Numerous research studies have proposed methods, proof-of-concept prototypes, and design disciplines for developing and maintaining novel ubiquitous services. Despite these efforts, it is unclear whether current solutions can achieve the required dependability levels for emerging mobile ubiquitous applications, such as smart urban mobility, wireless control of robots, and ambient-assisted living. This uncertainty is partly due to the lack of interaction between the ubiquitous computing and dependable computing research communities. Different research perspectives often result in similar problems being addressed in different ways, without fully leveraging the potential synergies from closer, multidisciplinary collaboration.

The mission of ADAMUS is to highlight these issues and bridge the gap between these seemingly distant research communities. The workshop aims to:

- Propose novel solutions for designing and developing adaptive and dependable mobile ubiquitous systems.
- Develop conceptual models and paradigms for change tolerance.
- Provide analytical and simulation models and tools to measure system resilience to faults and adaptability to new environments.
- Foster the exchange of ideas and lively discussions that can drive future research and development in this area.

## This Year’s Workshop

Building on the success of the previous four editions, ADAMUS 2011 serves as a platform for researchers and industry professionals to discuss and explore adaptive and dependable mobile ubiquitous systems. Participants were encouraged to submit high-quality papers that identify open issues, discuss the limitations and advantages of existing solutions, or propose innovative techniques for adaptive and dependable applications in mobile environments.

This fifth edition of ADAMUS maintains its multidisciplinary nature, with contributions ranging from privacy leakage in location-based social networks to dependability assessment through the dynamic collection of failure data from mobile phones. The workshop also addresses various aspects, including collaborative wireless sensing and quality-of-service routing in dynamic, wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks with frequent link breaks. Four high-quality papers are featured in this edition, and their main subjects are summarized below.

### Paper 1: "Adaptive Collaborative Sensing using Mobile Phones and Stationary Sensors" by Edith Ngai

This paper explores the opportunity of complementing sensor networks with the collaboration of mobile phones to improve overall sensing quality while addressing the known battery limitations and failure-prone behavior of sensor nodes. The author proposes an adaptive collaborative algorithm to coordinate sensing among stationary sensors and mobile users in the area of interest. The algorithm is shown to achieve the desired level of sensing quality while minimizing overall energy consumption, even when simulating unusual events.

### Paper 2: "Enabling On-Line Dependability Assessment of Android Smart Phones" by Marcello Cinque

This paper addresses the conflicting requirements of dependability and rapid time-to-market for mobile software. The author presents a logging platform for Android smartphones that allows for the dynamic collection and analysis of failure data, enabling the assessment of dependability despite the rapidly evolving scenarios brought about by the use of ever-changing third-party software and features.

### Paper 3: "A Novel Design of Node-Disjoint Multi-path QoS Routing in Multi-hop Ad Hoc Networks" by Szu-Lin Su and Yi-Wen Su

This paper deals with the problem of frequent link breaks in dynamic mobile ad-hoc networks by designing a novel QoS-aware routing protocol based on predetermined backup routes. The use of redundant paths avoids wasteful route discovery operations and contributes to the overall network quality in terms of delay, throughput, overhead, and blocking rate.

### Paper 4: "Privacy Leakage in Two-Party Group Nearest Neighbor Queries" by Yan Huang and Cai Chen

This paper focuses on group nearest neighbor queries in location-based social networks and assesses the inherent privacy leakage. The risks of attacks exploiting this leakage are quantified through a privacy leakage index, and a solution to mitigate this problem is briefly outlined.

These four papers present diverse approaches to designing, monitoring, and evaluating the dependability and security of adaptive and dependable mobile ubiquitous systems and enabling technologies. We believe this heterogeneity will significantly contribute to the discussions at the workshop, helping to define a more consolidated state-of-the-art and state-of-practice in the design and assessment of future dependable ubiquitous systems.
