## Windows Accessibility Tools
| Binary                | Description                           | Access Method                        |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Utilman.exe           | Utility Manager                       | Windows Key + U                      |
| Sethc.exe             | Accessibility shortcut keys           | Press Shift 5 times                  |
| Osk.exe               | On-Screen Keyboard                    | Locate option using mouse            |
| Magnify.exe           | Magnifier                             | Windows Key + [Equal Sign]           |
| Narrator.exe          | Narrator                              | Windows Key + Enter                  |
| DisplaySwitch.exe     | Display Switcher                      | Windows Key + P                      |
| AtBroker.exe          | Manages switching of apps between desktops | Open osk.exe, Magnify.exe, or Narrator.exe, then lock the computer. AtBroker.exe will be executed upon locking and unlocking |

## Historical Context
- **"How to Reset Windows Passwords" Websites**
  - Replace `sethc.exe` or `utilman.exe` with `cmd.exe`
  - Reboot, press Shift 5 times or WIN+U
  - Use `net user (username) (password)` to change password
  - Log in!
- **Persistence and Backdoor Usage**
  - Often not cleaned up after use
  - Can serve as a backdoor/persistence method
  - No Windows Event Logs are generated when the backdoor is executed

## Implementation
### Binary Replacement
- Replace any of the accessibility tool binaries
- Requires elevated rights
- May require taking ownership of files

### Registry (Debugger Method)
- **Registry Path:** `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\sethc.exe`
- **Debugger Value:** `REG_SZ C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`
- Requires elevated rights

## Limitations
- Elevated access or offline system required
- Replacing binary must be digitally signed
- Replacing binary must exist in `\System32\`
- Replacing binary must be in the Windows "Protected File" list
- Only `cmd.exe` or `cmd.exe /c file.bat` can be used

## Background
- While working with an Incident Response Team:
  - Discovered dozens of vulnerable servers and workstations via file checks
  - Identification was done from the filesystem side
  - Missed the Debugger Method
  - Missed unmanaged boxes
  - Needed a network-based scanner

- We wanted to develop our own network-based tool
- Started with JavaRDP
- Found @ztgraceâ€™s PoC script, Sticky Keys Hunter
  - Worked well and was a great starting point
  - Similar to "Peeping Tom"
  - Opens a Remote Desktop connection
  - Sends keyboard presses
  - Saves a screenshot to a file
  - Needed bug fixes, additional checks, and had a TODO list, but was not actively developed

## Our Solution
- Automated Command Prompt Detection
- Parallelized scanning of multiple hosts
- Numerous bug fixes
- Error handling
- Dynamic timing
- Requires `imagemagick`, `xdotool`, `bc`, and `parallel`
- All packages are available in the Kali repositories

### Demo
- Ties up a Linux VM while scanning
- Needed for window focus and screenshotting
- Will not catch binaries replaced with anything other than `cmd.exe`
- Involves scrolling through screenshots
- Encountered `taskmgr.exe`, `mmc.exe`, and other custom applications

## Statistics
- Scanned over 100,000 boxes on a large Business ISP
- Approximately 571 Command Prompts (1 out of every 175)
- Affects all types of institutions:
  - Educational Institutions
  - Law Offices
  - Manufacturing Facilities
  - Gaming Companies
  - Etc.

## Recommendations
### Remediation
- Delete or replace the affected file (`sethc.exe`, `utilman.exe`, etc.)
- Run `sfc.exe /scannow`
- Remove the affected registry entry

### Prevention and Detection
- Enable Network Level Authentication for Remote Desktop Connection
- Restrict local administrative access
- Enable Full Disk Encryption (FDE) and protect the key
- Implement endpoint monitoring

## Summary
- Multi-threaded scanner for binary replacement backdoors with command prompt detection
- TODO:
  - Code cleanup
  - Read in nmap output
  - Code will be available on GitHub
