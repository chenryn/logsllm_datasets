**Current Behavior**
Currently, the Angular router API does not provide an equivalent to `history.replaceState`. The only available method for redirection appears to be the `redirectTo` option in `RouterConfig`.

**Expected/Derived Behavior**
I would like to have the ability to dynamically redirect users within my application.

**Environment Details:**
- **Angular Version:** 2.0.0-rc.3
- **Browser:** All
- **Language:** All
