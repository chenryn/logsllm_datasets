**ATT&CK ID:** T0867  
**Technique Name:** Lateral Tool Transfer

Adversaries may transfer tools or other files from one system to another during an operation to stage adversary tools or other files. This lateral file transfer can also occur between internal victim systems to support lateral movement and remote execution. Adversaries often use inherent file-sharing protocols, such as SMB (Server Message Block), to copy files to connected network shares. This technique facilitates the spread of malicious tools and files across the network, enabling further compromise and persistence.
