# Sample B â€“ Data Exfiltration and Propagation

### Data Exfiltration
- **RAR Archives Creation**: The attacker created RAR archives using WinRar and protected them with a password.
  - **Password Recovery**: We retrieved the passwords for these RAR files by analyzing RAM dumps from the compromised systems and parsing for significant strings. 
  - **Recovered Password**: "SYSTEMNAME#623!" was identified and successfully used to decrypt the RAR files.
- **Data Export**: The data was exported over SSL to a host in South Korea (IP: 211.232.XXX.X).
- **Estimated Impact**: Based on the contents of the RAR files, it is estimated that 350,000 or more credit cards were exfiltrated during the time the attackers had access to the systems.

### Propagation
- **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Connection**: The attackers used RDP to connect to 35 other hotel locations via the corporate WAN.
- **On-Site Verification**: Upon visiting many of these locations, we found identical sets of tools and large quantities of RAR files containing credit card data.

### Live Demo
- **Process**: `WINMGMT.EXE`

### Additional Comments
- **Malware Detection Challenges**:
  - **Anti-Virus Limitations**: Anti-virus software often fails to detect this type of malware because they only recognize known threats.
  - **Lack of Log Review**: Insufficient log review processes.
  - **Prohibited Data Storage**: No checks for the storage of prohibited data, which is often a sign of unauthorized activity.
  - **IT Talent Issues**: In some cases, IT staff simply searched Google for the malware name, leading to ineffective results.

# Sample C: Video Poker in Lake Tahoe

### Introduction
- **Note**: This section is based on actual cases where "credentialed" malware was discovered. It does not imply that any specific Video Poker system is vulnerable to this attack method.

### Credentialed Malware
- **Definition**: A program designed to exploit functions of the target application that are not typically available to the normal end user.
- **Access Control**: Access to the malware's functions is controlled by the developer using various forms of "authentication" tokens.
- **Authentication Tokens**: These tokens can be sold or rented to criminals to illegally obtain whatever the target application provides.

### Architecture
- **A**: Video Poker Machine
- **B**: Voucher Reader/Printer
- **C**: Casino Network
- **D**: The Casino

### Common Problems
- **Maintenance and Monitoring**:
  - **Machine Maintenance**: Due to the high number of machines, maintenance is frequent.
  - **Monitoring Repair Personnel**: The "Eye in the Sky" (surveillance) may not always monitor repair personnel.
  - **Password Management**: Unique passwords are difficult to manage.
  - **Antivirus Software**: Running antivirus software on Video Poker machines is often overlooked.
  - **Hardware Vulnerabilities**: Under the hardened case, these machines are low-end PCs with USB ports, etc.
  - **Operating System and Patching**: What OS are they running? How often are they patched?

### Installation Vector
- **Scenario 1**:
  - **Attacker Disguise**: The attacker, dressed as casino repair staff, approaches the Video Poker Machine.
  - **Login**: They log in using a default/common password.
  - **Malware Deployment**: The attacker inserts a USB key with the malware, copies the dropper to the local file system, executes it, and then removes the USB key.
- **Scenario 2**:
  - **Backdoor at Manufacturer**: The malware is installed at the manufacturer as a backdoor, active on every deployed Video Poker machine.

### Analysis
- **VIDEOPOKER.EXE**:
  - **Voucher Parsing**: While active, the malware parses for valid vouchers and looks for a User Voucher.
  - **User Voucher Identification**: The value of the voucher is passed through a hashing algorithm and compared to set values stored in the malware.
  - **Functionality**:
    - **Uninstall**: Deletes the malware service and restores system logs.
    - **Display Stats**: Shows information on the number of User Vouchers used and the malware version.
    - **Odds Shift**: Modifies the odds by increasing face cards in the deck.
    - **Modify Credits**: Prompts the user to enter a credit value, adds it to the game, and allows cash out.
    - **Test Printer**: Prints 'hello world' to the voucher printer.
    - **Exit**: Returns to normal gameplay or enters a sub-function.

### Propagation
- **Network Vulnerability**: If the Video Poker machine is connected to the casino network, a service-based vulnerability would be required for propagation.
- **Verification**: Attackers can check for successful propagation by inserting a User Voucher into random machines, which will either be rejected or activate the malware.

### Live Demo
- **Process**: `VIDEOPOKER.EXE`

# Sample D: Restaurant in Michigan

### Architecture
- **Firewall/Linksys Router**: Allowing VNC (Port 5900)
- **Back of House Server**: No egress filtering
- **POS Terminals**: Internet access permitted

### Problems
- **VNC Access**: Allowed from the internet to the restaurant POS server.
- **Weak Passwords**: Common and weak passwords, e.g., Admin: support.
- **No Antivirus**: POS terminals were not running antivirus software.
- **Unrestricted Internet Access**: Allowed from all systems, including POS terminals.
- **Shared Passwords**: The POS integrator used the same passwords for all restaurants in the region.

# Conclusions
- **Malware Prevalence**: Malware remains a dominant threat.
- **Targeted Data**: Computer memory is a primary target for extracting sensitive data.
- **Security Gaps**: Companies still struggle with proper segmentation, password management, and firewall configurations, leading to easy entry points.
- **Attacker Sophistication**: Attackers invest time in learning even obscure business applications before creating targeted malware.
- **Rapid Spread**: Once malware proves successful, similar businesses and environments are quickly targeted.
