### Manual Filtering and Off-Net Footprint Identification
We classify Autonomous Systems (ASes) that do not belong to the Hypergiant (HG) organization but host IP addresses serving its associated certificates as part of the HG's off-net footprint (see §4 for more details).

### A.3 Characteristics of HG Certificates
We present key characteristics of certificates served by HGs.

#### Certificate Numbers and IP Groups
The total number of certificates varies significantly among HGs, ranging from a few hundred (e.g., Google in 2021) to many thousands (e.g., Facebook in 2021). The number of certificates tends to increase over time, though at different rates for each HG. Each certificate can be served by multiple IP addresses. Figure 11 illustrates the coverage of the top ten IP groups (each serving the same certificate) for Google and Facebook over time. For Google, the top ten groups account for over 90% of the certificate-serving IP addresses, with more than 50% serving the certificate for `*.googlevideo.com` and other DNS names associated with Google’s off-net services. Facebook, on the other hand, started with a highly aggregated pattern in 2014, which evolved into a more disaggregated pattern by 2021.

#### Expiration Times
The validity periods for HG TLS certificates vary widely, both across different HGs and over time. For example, Microsoft's certificates had a median duration of one year between 2013 and 2016, between one and two years from 2016 to 2017, and two years from 2018 to 2019. Google generally uses certificates with a median duration of three months. Netflix's median expiry times fluctuated between eight months and two years, but dropped to 35 days in 2019, aligning with their strategic shift towards short-lived certificates, first announced in 2016 [84].

### A.4 Survey Questions
The survey was conducted for the analysis of data on November 30, 2020. The questions are as follows:

1. **Overall, how do you rate the estimation of the off-net footprint of your HG?**
2. **Do we overestimate or underestimate the off-net footprint of your HG?**
   - Overestimate
   - Underestimate
   - Estimation is quite accurate
3. **What is our estimation error of the off-net footprint?**
   - Excellent
   - Very good
   - Good
   - Poor
   - 1%
   - 5%
   - 10%
   - 20%+
4. **Do we miss any AS when we report the off-net footprint of your HG? If yes, what type of ASes do we miss?**
   - Only a few ASes are missing
   - Datacenter ASes
   - Eyeball ASes
   - Transit ASes
   - Free text – report the type(s) of ASes

### A.5 List of Keywords and Headers
Table 4 presents the keywords and headers used in our study to identify HGs and validate the installation of their servers in off-nets (see Section 4.4). In addition to the HGs listed in Table 4, we used the following Hypergiant keywords: Bamtech, CDN77, Cachefly, Chinacache, Disney, Highwinds, and Yahoo. For these additional HGs, we were unable to identify unique HTTP(S) headers to extract fingerprints.

### A.6 User Population Coverage Based on Customer Cone
Section 6.5 examines the extent of Internet user population coverage that can be served from Google’s off-nets, including users within the hosting networks and their customer cones. Figure 12 plots the percentage of a country’s Internet users within the customer cones of ASes hosting Facebook, Netflix, and Akamai off-net servers (April 2021). Serving into the customer cone, rather than just the hosting networks, notably expands Facebook's coverage in parts of Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America, increasing service from 49.9% to 63.2%, a 26.8% increase in Internet users. For Netflix, this approach slightly increases population coverage in South America, North America, and Africa, raising the user population coverage from 16.3% to 26%, a 59.4% increase. For Akamai, the coverage increases significantly in Asia, Europe, and South America, resulting in a 49.1% increase, from 51.7% to 77%.

### A.7 Off-Net Growth per Network Type and Region
Combining Sections 6.3 and 6.4, Figure 13 shows the growth of the top-4 HGs (Google, Netflix, Facebook, and Akamai) per network type (Stub, Small, Medium, Large) in different regions. Our results indicate that the expansion of HG off-nets into more stub ASes slowed down in all regions until early 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. After the summer of 2020, expansion resumed across all HGs and regions, except for Akamai. The fraction of stub ASes with Akamai off-nets shrank by around 80% in North America but doubled in Asia, suggesting that large CDNs can flexibly rearrange their off-net footprint to better achieve their objectives. Akamai’s off-net footprint decreased by more than 50% in small ASes over the years, while it expanded in medium and larger ASes in Asia and South America.

### A.8 Willingness by Networks to Host HGs
We further investigate the symbiosis of HGs and networks, particularly for the four Hypergiants with the largest footprints. Figures 14a and 14b show the total number of ASes that host at least one top-4 HG in at least 25% and at least 50% of the dataset snapshots, respectively, and the percentage they represent of the total ASes that host ≥1 of the top-11 HGs in at least one data snapshot. Both figures indicate that the majority of ASes chose to host only one top-4 HG until late 2019, after which more ASes began to host up to all the top-4 HGs. This trend coincides with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as content providers adjusted their deployment strategies to meet the increased user traffic demand. The percentage of ASes hosting one to four top-4 HGs varied between 10% and 20% over the years, with a peak between 2017 and 2018. After 2018, the trend showed a slight decline.
