**Symfony Version**  
3.2.6

**Description:**

According to the Symfony documentation, the default value of the `empty_data` option for `\Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\Type\TextType` is an empty string (`''`):

> **empty_data**
>
> - **Type:** mixed
> - **Default Value:** `''` (the empty string)

However, in version 3.2.6, I have observed that the default value of `empty_data` is actually `null`.

I was unable to locate where this behavior is defined in the code, so I could not verify it directly.

This discrepancy between the documentation and the actual behavior may lead to unexpected results when using forms in Symfony 3.2.6.
