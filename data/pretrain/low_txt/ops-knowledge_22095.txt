### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:08:49 to 18:08:54 on October 18, highlights several key issues and actions within a Hadoop environment. The logs are generated by various components, including `RMCommunicator Allocator`, `LeaseRenewer`, and `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client`.

#### Key Observations:

1. **Address Changes**:
   - Multiple address changes are detected for both the `RMCommunicator Allocator` (port 8030) and `LeaseRenewer` (port 9000). The old address `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170` is replaced with `msra-sa-41`.

2. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component is unable to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`. This failure occurs repeatedly, with the duration increasing from 232 seconds to 236 seconds over the log period. The system indicates that it will retry shortly.

3. **Connection Retries to RM**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is attempting to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`. The connection attempts are failing, and the system is using a retry policy of `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between each attempt.
   - Each failed connection attempt is logged as an `ERROR IN CONTACTING RM`.

#### Detailed Breakdown:

- **10-18 18:08:49**:
  - Address change detected for `RMCommunicator Allocator` and `LeaseRenewer`.
  - Lease renewal failure for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` after 232 seconds.

- **10-18 18:08:50**:
  - Connection retry to `msra-sa-41:8030` with the specified retry policy.
  - Error in contacting the Resource Manager (RM).
  - Another address change detected for `LeaseRenewer`.
  - Lease renewal failure for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` after 233 seconds.

- **10-18 18:08:51**:
  - Address change detected for `RMCommunicator Allocator` and `LeaseRenewer`.
  - Lease renewal failure for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` after 234 seconds.

- **10-18 18:08:52**:
  - Connection retry to `msra-sa-41:8030` with the specified retry policy.
  - Error in contacting the Resource Manager (RM).
  - Another address change detected for `LeaseRenewer`.
  - Lease renewal failure for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` after 235 seconds.

- **10-18 18:08:53**:
  - Address change detected for `RMCommunicator Allocator` and `LeaseRenewer`.
  - Lease renewal failure for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` after 236 seconds.

- **10-18 18:08:54**:
  - Connection retry to `msra-sa-41:8030` with the specified retry policy.
  - Error in contacting the Resource Manager (RM).
  - Another address change detected for `LeaseRenewer`.

### Conclusion

The log chunk indicates ongoing issues with address changes, lease renewal failures, and connection attempts to the Resource Manager. The system is actively retrying these operations, but the underlying problems persist. Further investigation into the network configuration and the state of the Resource Manager may be necessary to resolve these issues.
