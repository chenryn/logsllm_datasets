### Synchronization Header in LTE and MegaMIMO

In LTE, it is not feasible to insert new headers between frames. To make MegaMIMO compatible with LTE, the leader node transmits its synchronization information using the same resource elements that Chorus uses for its synchronization signals. Since MegaMIMO does not have layers, a MegaMIMO leader broadcasts its synchronization signal across all layer channels.

### Deployment Scenario

We deployed our system across a single floor of a building, which includes both offices and conference rooms. The deployment consists of 20 nodes, with 10 acting as small cells and 10 as clients. To emulate a larger geographic area, we reduced the transmission power. We measured the pairwise link quality between all small cells to identify nodes with good mutual reception.

### Simulation Parameters

Our simulation adheres to the 3GPP TR 36.814 V9.0.0 Non Line of Sight (NLOS) propagation model for a Manhattan grid layout. Receivers have a noise floor of -100 dB, corresponding to a standard noise figure of 6 dB at 27°C for a 5 MHz bandwidth. This results in an SNR of 0 dB at around 300 meters. For dense deployments, we considered a scenario where small cells are separated by an average distance of 50 meters in an 8 km × 8 km grid, approximating the size of Manhattan. This setup includes 25,600 small cell nodes deployed uniformly at random. Each node has an oscillator model with a carrier frequency offset of ±100 ppb and phase noise of -88 dBc at 100 kHz for a 5 MHz bandwidth, typical for voltage, temperature, and oven-controlled oscillators used in small cells. The Chorus controller ensures phase synchronization despite oscillator offsets. We ran the layering algorithm on this simulated deployment and simulated network operation for 5 seconds, significantly longer than the typical channel coherence time of 100-200 ms.

### Layering Algorithm Visualization

Figure 10 visualizes the results of the layering algorithm, showing that the network has 19 layers. Chorus uses 8 distinct synchronization frequencies, which are reused as described in Section 5.

### Phase Variance Analysis

In our simulation, we can compute the absolute phase difference and phase variance between pairs of nodes. Figure 11 plots the median phase variance as a function of the distance between node pairs. The phase variance increases with distance but remains below 0.004 for nodes within 5 km of each other. This indicates that Chorus provides tight phase synchronization over distances much greater than the interference range, enabling joint transmission from multiple transmitters. For nodes farther apart, the higher phase variance is irrelevant because they are beyond the interference range, and no client will hear these distant nodes. Thus, Chorus's synchronization fabric scales well to large networks, allowing the creation of a distributed phase coherence abstraction across thousands of nodes.

### Conclusion

We presented Chorus, a new design for distributed MIMO with a fully distributed phase synchronization protocol. All nodes contribute equally to propagating the synchronization signal. Chorus enables dense 5G small cell deployments to coordinate transmissions, eliminate interference, and deliver high throughput. The resulting distributed MIMO network is scalable, resilient to failures, and adaptable to changes in connectivity. We integrated Chorus with an open-source LTE stack library and demonstrated its ability to provide tight synchronization and distributed-MIMO throughput gains with unmodified end-user devices. We believe Chorus's flexible and self-healing design will enable practical, manageable use in large networks, moving distributed-MIMO from small-scale demonstrations to real-world applications.
