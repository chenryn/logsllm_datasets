### Two-Factor Authentication Ripped by Phishers
**Date:** Sunday, June 29, 2008  
**Page:** 21

#### Bypassing the 2-Factor Authentication 1/3
1. The victim logs into the fake banking website using their username, password, and one-time-use security token generated from the security device provided by the bank.
2. The attacker uses the login information entered by the victim at the fake banking website to log into the real banking website.
3. To maintain access to the authenticated session, the attacker writes an automation script that reloads the real website or randomly clicks on main links at the website.

**Note:** The technique used in step 3 employs 'local session riding' at the attacker’s server to forge requests on behalf of the victim to the real banking site.

#### Bypassing the 2-Factor Authentication 2/3
1. The attacker retrieves information from the real banking website and stores it in the simulated fake banking website database:
   - Account number
   - Account Owner Full Name
   - Account Balance
   - Last Login Date and Time
   - Transaction history
   - Other Details

**Note:** The automation script written by the attacker will keep running at the simulated fake banking website to maintain the authenticated session with the real banking website.

#### Bypassing the 2-Factor Authentication 3/3
- In online banking systems protected with 2-factor authentication, a security token is required from the user for each transaction.
- Whenever the victim enters a security token to perform a transaction, the attacker uses the security token entered at the fake website to perform a fund transfer from the victim’s banking account to their money mule’s account.

**Note:** The automation script written by the attacker will keep running at the simulated fake banking website to maintain the authenticated session with the real banking website.
