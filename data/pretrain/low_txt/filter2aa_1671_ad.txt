### RTP Audio Streams
- **Find Reverse:** This function identifies both the sender and receiver RTP streams.
- **Analyse Spectrum:** The spectrum of the audio stream can be analyzed for further insights.
- **Save As:** You have the option to save the identified RTP streams for future reference.

### DTMF Tones in RTP
- DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) tones are encoded using RTP events.

### Media Transport Security
- **Secure Real-time Transfer Protocol (SRTP):** 
  - **Encryption:** Ensures that the media data is protected from unauthorized access.
  - **Message Authentication:** Verifies the integrity and origin of the messages.
  - **Integrity:** Ensures that the data has not been altered during transmission.
  - **Replay Protection:** Prevents the replay of previously transmitted data.
  - **Key Management for SRTP:** Manages the cryptographic keys used for encryption and authentication.
- **SDES (Session Description Protocol Security Descriptions):** While SDES provides a method for key management, it remains vulnerable when used without TLS (Transport Layer Security).
- **ZRTP/ZRTP/S:** Provides secure key exchange using Diffie-Hellman handshakes.
- **MIKEY (Multimedia Internet KEYing):** Supports public key encryption for key management.

### Advanced or Basic SRTP/RTP Attacks
- **Eavesdropping Techniques:**
  - ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) attacks
  - DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) attacks
  - Proxy attacks
- **RTP Information Overwriting:** The RTP information in SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) requests can be overwritten.
- **Master Key Extraction:** The master key can be extracted from the SDP (Session Description Protocol) content in SIP requests.
- **Network MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) Attacks for RTP:**

### Decoding SRTP
- **Hacking VoIP – Decrypting SDES Protected SRTP Phone Calls:**
  - Obtain a complete call, including the SIP exchange and RTP data, between two endpoints.
  - Extract the key and filter out a single SRTP stream using Wireshark.
  - Use `srtp-decrypt` (available at [GitHub](https://github.com/gteissier/srtp-decrypt)) to decrypt the SRTP.
  - Replay the decrypted RTP data in Wireshark.

### Eavesdropping Tools
- **Wireshark:** Can decode and play RTP streams, supporting different codecs and multiple streams.
- **Cain & Abel:** A popular tool for network packet analysis and eavesdropping.
- **UCSniff:** Used for call recording and other VoIP-related eavesdropping activities.
