**Title: Dependability Challenges and Strategies in the UK National Health Service's National Programme for Information Technology**

**Author: Brian Randell, Newcastle University**

The National Health Service (NHS) is the primary provider of healthcare in the United Kingdom. Serving a population of over 50 million, it employs approximately 40,000 general practitioners (family physicians), 80,000 other doctors, and 350,000 nurses. The NHS also operates more than 300 hospitals.

The National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT) is the largest civilian IT project globally, with estimated costs ranging from £6.2 billion to £20 billion. Launched in 2002, NPfIT aims to implement electronic care records, medical records, radiography, patient administration, and other health information services. These services will be accessible to all NHS professionals in England, with strictly controlled access to ensure reliability and security.

This special plenary session will provide an overview of NPfIT and its dependability challenges and strategies. It is anticipated that speakers will include representatives from Connecting for Health (the NHS agency responsible for NPfIT), the medical profession, and the dependability research community.
