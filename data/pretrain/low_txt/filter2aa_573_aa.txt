- **Key Strategies**
- **Cyberwar Potential Attacks**
- **Cyberarmy Tasks**
- **Possible Defenses**

### About This Talk
- **Originally Presented At**: Conference for Cyber Conflict, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence
- **Audience**: Technical and Policy Experts
- **Version**: More technical (and hopefully humorous)

## Speaker Bio
- **Education**: PhD in Mathematics, University of Notre Dame
- **Experience**:
  - 1 year as a Security Architect at a Financial Services firm
  - 5 years as an NSA Global Network Exploitation Analyst
  - 4 years as a consultant for Independent Security Evaluators
  - Specialized in application and network penetration testing, project planning, and scoping
  - First remote exploits against iPhone and G1 Android phone
  - 3-time winner of the Pwn2Own competition

### Career Highlights
- **NSA Approved Resume**:
  - **Computer Network Exploitation**: Performed computer network scanning and reconnaissance, executed numerous computer network exploitations against foreign targets.
  - **Network Intrusion Analysis**: Designed and developed network intrusion detection tools to find and stop exploitation of NIPRNET hosts and locate already compromised hosts.

## Why I Gave This Talk
- **Context**: Those in charge of "cyber" policy often lack technical understanding.
- **Purpose**: To help decision-makers discern fact from fiction in cyberwarfare.

### Basics
- **Comparison of Military Spending**:
  - **U.S. Annual Military Spending**: $708 Billion
  - **U.S. Cyber Command**: $105 Million
  - **North Korea Military Spending**: $5 Billion
  - **North Korean Cyber Warfare Spending**: $56 Million
  - **Iran Cyber Warfare Spending**: $76 Million
  - **Hypothetical Cyber Army Budget**: $49 Million

### Aspects of Cyberwarfare
- **Collect Intelligence**
- **Control Systems**
- **Deny or Disable Systems**
- **Cause Harm on the Level of Kinetic Attacks**

### Statistics
- **IP Addresses**: ~3.7 billion
- **Personal Computers**: ~2 billion
- **iPhones Worldwide**: ~41 million
- **Botnets**:
  - **Zeus**: 3.6 million (.1% of personal computers)
  - **Koobface**: 2.9 million
  - **TidServ**: 1.5 million
  - **Conficker**: 10 million+

### Key Concepts
- **Botnet**: A distributed set of software programs that run autonomously and automatically. The individual software running on each system is called a bot.
- **Remote Access Tool (RAT)**: A program that allows remote control of a device/computer, enabling search, monitoring, and attacks on other hosts.
- **Zero-Day Exploit**: A vulnerability or exploit for which there is no available patch or fix. These are difficult to defend against due to their unknown nature.

### Zero-Day Examples
- **Samba Bug**: Found in August 2005, sold in August 2006, fixed in May 2007.
- **Adobe JBIG2 Vulnerability**: Discovered in 2008, sold in January 2009, discussed in February 2009, patched in March 2009.
- **Pwn2Own 2008 Bug**: Used in Pwn2Own 2009, fixed two months later.

### Zero-Day Lifespan
- **Average Lifespan**: 348 days
- **Shortest-Lived**: 99 days
- **Longest-Lived**: 1080 days (nearly three years)

### Overall Strategies
- **Dominate Cyberspace**: Control as many devices as possible to maintain operational capability and attribution.
- **Infiltrate Key Systems in Advance**: Conduct research and intelligence gathering.
- **Use Known Exploits When Possible, Zero-Days When Necessary**: Balance between cost and effectiveness.

### Specific Strategies
- **Hack the Planet**: Control a large number of devices to ensure operational resilience.
- **Advance Planning**: Research and plan attacks on well-secured networks, avoiding quick, easily detected actions.
- **Research and Intelligence**: Understand key financial and SCADA systems, core Internet routers, DNS servers, and existing defenses.
- **To Zero-Day or Not**: Use known vulnerabilities and tools to avoid military attribution, but use zero-day exploits for critical operations.

### Other Strategies
- **Logic Bombs**: Implement Clarke's logic bombs.
- **Cyber Criminals**: Steal from or pay cyber criminals for access.
- **Insider Backdoors**: Utilize employees at major tech companies to create backdoors.

### Potential Cyberwar Attacks
- **Shut Down the Internet**
- **Take Financial Markets Offline**: Corrupt or destroy financial data.
- **Disrupt Shipping and Air Transportation**
- **Blackouts**
- **Disable Communication Within Military**
- **Disable Cell Phone Networks**

### Cyberarmy Tasks
- **Communication Redundancy**: Geographically distributed operators with multiple offices and redundant communication methods.
- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**: Flood targets with traffic to deny DNS, bandwidth, and server access.
- **Collecting Hosts**: Assume ownership of existing botnets, use client-side vulnerabilities, and clean up existing malware.
- **The North Korean Botnets**: Develop a large, diverse set of bot software, avoid central control, and ensure geographical diversity.

### Conclusion
- **Summary of Key Points**
- **Lessons Learned**

This talk aims to provide a comprehensive overview of building and deploying a cyber army, with a focus on strategic planning, operational tactics, and potential impacts.
