### Why Xprobe? - Cons

- **Protocol Limitation**: Xprobe is limited to the ICMP and UDP protocols only. 
- **Defeatable by Smart Firewalls**: Internet usage can be hindered by smart firewall rule bases.
- **TCP Correlation Needed**: For more accurate Active OS fingerprinting, a failover to TCP or a correlation with TCP needs to be implemented in a smart manner. This would enable a highly accurate tool that uses minimal traffic to determine the remote operating system.
- **Static Decision Tree Limitations**: The static decision tree, which is hardcoded into the binary, is limited in its ability to add new operating systems and networking devices.

### Xprobe – Inner Working

Xprobe has two development branches:
- **0.0.x (Static Decision Tree)**: Limited in the number of operating systems and networking devices it supports. Adding new systems requires hardcoding, making it a challenging task.
- **0.1.x (Signature Dynamic DB Support)**: Uses a signature database for adding support for new operating systems and networking devices. This makes it easier and more flexible to maintain and update signatures.

**Key Differences**:
- **0.0.x Dev-Tree**: Utilizes a predefined static decision tree, which is hardcoded. Adding new systems is difficult and requires changes to the binary.
- **0.1.x Dev-Tree**: Employs a signature database. To add support for a new system, an entry in the signature database is created, making it more manageable and flexible.

**Summary**:
- Version 0.1.x offers a more accurate, easier, and more flexible way to maintain and update signatures compared to version 0.0.x.
- Both development trees use the same Active OS fingerprinting methods based on the ICMP protocol.

### Xprobe - ICMP Error Message Echoing Integrity

Each ICMP error message includes the IP Header and at least the first 8 data bytes of the datagram that triggered the error. More than 8 bytes may be sent according to RFC 1122. Some stack implementations may alter the offending packet's IP header and the underlying protocol's data when sending back an ICMP error message. A malicious attacker could examine these alterations to make assumptions about the target operating system.

**Expected Alterations**:
- **IP Time-to-Live (TTL) Field**: Decreased by one each time the IP Header is processed.
- **IP Header Checksum**: Recalculated each time the TTL field value is decreased.

### Xprobe - ICMP Error Message Echoing Integrity

Xprobe leverages ICMP Port Unreachable error messages triggered by UDP datagrams sent to closed UDP ports. It examines several IP Header and UDP-related fields for alterations.

**Fields Examined**:
- **IP Total Length Field**:
  - Some operating systems add 20 bytes to the original IP total length field.
  - Others decrease 20 bytes from the original IP total length field.
  - Some echo the correct field value.
- **IPID Field**:
  - Some operating systems change the bit order of the IPID field.
  - Others echo the correct field value.

**Other Fields**:
- **3Bits Flags and Offset Fields**: Some operating systems change the bit order, while others echo correctly.
- **IP Header Checksum**: Some miscalculate or zero out the checksum, while others echo correctly.
- **UDP Header Checksum**: Some miscalculate or zero out the checksum, while others echo correctly.

**Multiple Tests**:
- Some operating system stacks do not echo several field values correctly in a single ICMP Error Message. This allows multiple echoing integrity tests to be performed using just one ICMP Error message.

### Xprobe - ICMP Error Message Echoing Integrity Examples

**Example 1: AIX 3.2**
- **IP Total Length Field Value**: Echoed as 118, while the original was 98.
- **IP Header Checksum**: Miscalculated.

**Example 2: OpenBSD 2.8**
- **IP Total Length Field Value**: Echoed 20 bytes less than the original.

### Xprobe - Precedence Bits Issues

Each IP Datagram has an 8-bit "TOS Byte" field, which includes:
- **Precedence Field (3 bits)**: Prioritizes the IP Datagram with eight levels.
- **Type-of-Service Field (4 bits)**: Describes how the network should handle tradeoffs between throughput, delay, reliability, and cost.
- **MBZ (Must Be Zero) Field (1 bit)**: Unused and must be zero.

**RFC 1812 Requirements**:
- **ICMP Source Quench Messages**: Must have the same IP Precedence field value as the triggering packet.
- **Other ICMP Error Messages**: Should have a precedence value of 6 (INTERNETWORK CONTROL) or 7 (NETWORK CONTROL).

**Implementations**:
- **Linux Kernel 2.0.x, 2.2.x, 2.4.x**: Set Precedence bits to 0xc0.
- **Cisco Routers (IOS 11.x-12.x) and Foundry Networks Switches**: Also set Precedence bits to 0xc0.

### Xprobe - ICMP Error Message Quoting Size

Each ICMP error message includes the IP Header and at least the first 8 data bytes of the offending datagram. Many operating systems quote the first 8 data bytes, but some echo more.

**Operating Systems Quoting More**:
- **Linux (Kernel 2.0.x/2.2.x/2.4.x)**
- **Sun Solaris 2.x**
- **HPUX 11.x**
- **MacOS 7.x-9.x**
- **Nokia FW boxes**

**Example with Linux Kernel 2.4.6**:
- **Precedence Field Value**: 0xc0
- **Data Echoed**: More than 8 bytes

### Xprobe - Using Code Field Values Different Than Zero with ICMP Echo Requests

When an ICMP code field value different than zero (0) is sent with an ICMP Echo request message (type 8), Microsoft-based operating systems will send back an ICMP code field value of zero with their ICMP Echo Reply. Other operating systems and networking devices will echo back the ICMP code field value used in the request.

**RFC 792 Guidelines**:
- The answering operating systems should only change the ICMP type to Echo reply (type 0), recalculate the checksums, and send the ICMP Echo reply.

### Xprobe - TOS Echoing

**RFC 1349** defines the usage of the Type-of-Service (TOS) field in ICMP messages:
- **ICMP Error Messages**: Always sent with the default TOS (0x0000).
- **ICMP Request Messages**: May be sent with any TOS value.
- **ICMP Reply Messages**: Sent with the same TOS value as the corresponding request message.

**Non-Compliance**:
- Some operating systems ignore RFC 1349 and do not send the same TOS value in the reply message as in the request message.
