### 5.5 Summary
In summary, faster sweeping rates generally result in lower runtime and memory overheads. However, pSweeper with faster sweeping rates will consume more energy and CPU resources. While this is acceptable when there are idle cores, it may significantly impact the performance of CPU-bound multi-threaded applications. Therefore, if an application is not memory-allocation-intensive, pSweeper should typically be configured to run at a lower sweeping rate.

### 6 Discussion & Limitations

#### Comparison to Garbage Collection (GC)
Garbage collection (GC) [6, 18] not only mitigates exploits but also prevents program crashes due to Use-After-Free (UaF) vulnerabilities. However, most GC algorithms consume more memory because they defer freeing until there is insufficient memory or when applications explicitly request it. Additionally, some dangling pointers can remain active for extended periods, preventing conservative GC from reclaiming freed memory. In contrast, pSweeper frees memory after one round of pointer sweeping and proactively eliminates dangling pointers. Moreover, stop-the-world GC can cause unpredictable interference with application performance. pSweeper, on the other hand, does not stall application threads. Finally, although pSweeper can only probabilistically mask program crashes, it guarantees to pinpoint the root causes of UaF vulnerabilities when programs crash.

#### pSweeper Metadata Protection
pSweeper does not specially protect its metadata, such as the MAS and PLM tables. However, this does not compromise our security guarantee. By design, all UaF exploits are disrupted. Thus, attackers can leak and tamper with metadata only through non-UaF vulnerabilities. As discussed in §2, orthogonal defenses should be used to protect against these vulnerabilities.

#### Accessing Freed Memory Due to Deferred Free
Since pSweeper defers object freeing until the end of a sweeping round, applications may access memory that should have been freed. This design is similar to garbage collection. Therefore, we believe this is not a critical concern in practice.

#### Energy Consumption
Since pSweeper continuously scans for dangling pointers in a concurrent thread, it consumes more power and energy. Consequently, it may not be suitable for deployment on battery-powered mobile devices. Instead, we envision pSweeper to be primarily deployed on desktops.

#### False Positives
False positives can occur in two cases. First, a pointer may be type-casted to and used as an integer. For example, a program might depend on the difference between two pointers, `p` and `q`. If `p` or `q` is neutralized by pSweeper, the value `(p - q)` will change. Second, applications may intentionally use the values in dangling pointers. Since these false positives are rare in practice, we believe they will not seriously affect the practicality of pSweeper. Notably, all three comparable approaches [36, 54, 58] suffer from the same false positives.

#### False Negatives
pSweeper relies on the types of global/local variables and operands in store instructions to identify live pointers. However, if an integer is type-casted to a pointer at runtime, or if pSweeper conservatively ignores unions containing non-pointer fields, pSweeper will experience false negatives if the missed pointers become dangling.

Another possible cause of false negatives is that pSweeper does not proactively neutralize dangling pointers in registers. Peeking into and tampering with the registers used by application threads would induce undue overhead. While these dangling pointers are theoretically false negatives, they are difficult to exploit in practice. Therefore, we do not currently address them, but we ensure they never propagate to memory (§4.5). All existing approaches [36, 54, 58] also do not handle dangling pointers in registers.

### 7 Related Work
We have compared pSweeper with DANGNULL [36], FreeSentry [58], and DangSan [54], which are the works closest to ours (§3.1). Here, we discuss the remaining related works.

#### Dangling Pointer Detection
Tools like Valgrind [45] and AddressSanitizer [51] track the (de)allocation status of each memory location. As long as a freed memory block is not reallocated, these tools can detect all dangling pointers. However, they can miss those pointing to a reallocated memory, which is common in UaF exploits. Another set of approaches extends each pointer with a unique identifier and checks the validity on every pointer dereference [15, 43, 56, 57]. Unfortunately, software-only explicit pointer checks can slow applications by an order of magnitude. Recently, Nagarakatte et al. [40, 41] proposed a hardware-assisted approach that provides full memory safety at low overheads. Undangle [19] detects dangling pointers using dynamic taint analysis to track pointer propagations at runtime. It can serve as an in-house testing tool but not a runtime defense system.

#### Safe Memory Allocators
Cling [14] is a safe memory allocator that avoids memory reuse among objects of different types, thwarting many, but not all, UaF exploits. DieHard [16] and DieHarder [47] are based on the idea of "infinite" heaps, which, while idealized, can only provide probabilistic memory safety. Exterminator [48] extends DieHard to automatically fix dangling pointers by delaying object frees. Dhurjati and Adve [26] used a new virtual page for each memory allocation and relied on page protection to detect dangling pointer accesses. Inspired by their work, Oscar [24] develops a page-permission-based protection scheme to ensure pointer safety. In contrast, pSweeper proactively neutralizes all dangling pointers.

#### Safe C Languages
Fail-safe C [49] implements a completely memory-safe compiler that is fully compatible with ANSI C, using garbage collection to protect against dangling pointers. There are also safe C dialects, such as Cyclone [28, 30] and CCured [21, 44]. Although they attempt to maintain compatibility with C/C++ specifications, significant efforts are still needed to retrofit legacy programs.

#### Parallelizing Security Checks
Concurrent security checks, as in pSweeper, have been adopted in several previous works. Speck [46] decouples security checks from applications and executes them in parallel on multiple cores. Unlike Speck, pSweeper does not use speculative execution. Cruiser [59] and Kruiser [52] use concurrent threads to detect buffer overflows in user applications and kernels, respectively. ShadowReplica [29] accelerates dynamic data flow tracking by running analysis on spare cores. However, pSweeper tackles a different problem and faces unique challenges. Finally, RCORE [27] detects program state invariant violations on idle cores. Although RCORE can also detect dangling pointers, it does not consider race conditions (e.g., dangling pointer propagation §4.5 and no deferred free in RCORE). RCORE also relies on static type analysis to identify pointers, which is challenging to be complete in real-world software. Therefore, pSweeper is more robust than RCORE.

### 8 Conclusion
This paper presents pSweeper, a system that effectively protects applications from UaF vulnerabilities with low overhead. The key feature of pSweeper is to iteratively sweep live pointers to neutralize dangling ones in concurrent threads. To accomplish this, we devise lock-free algorithms to address the entangled races among pSweeper and application threads, without using any heavyweight synchronization mechanisms that can stall application threads. We also propose encoding object origin information into dangling pointers to achieve object origin tracking, which helps pinpoint the root causes of UaF vulnerabilities. We implement a prototype of pSweeper and validate its effectiveness and efficiency in production environments.
