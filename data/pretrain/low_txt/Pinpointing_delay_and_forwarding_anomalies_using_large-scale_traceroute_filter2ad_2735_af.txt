### Appendix

#### A. Qualitative Comparison

Compared to Tulip [30], CING [11], Pong [17], and TSLP [28], our proposal offers several key advantages:
- **Compliance with Current Router Functionalities:** Our method aligns with existing router capabilities.
- **Robust Statistical Analysis:** We employ advanced statistical techniques for more accurate and reliable results.
- **Recycling of Existing Data:** Our approach leverages already available traceroute data, minimizing additional network load.

All these techniques, including ours, rely on routers sending back ICMP packets for TTL-expired packets. However, TSLP requires routers to implement IP options (pre-specified timestamps or record route). Tulip and CING require routers to implement ICMP Timestamp and have strong assumptions about IP ID implementation.

Additionally, some techniques have coverage limitations:
- **Pong** can only monitor paths between probes.
- **TSLP** considers only inter-domain symmetric links adjacent to the probes' ASs.
- **Our System** is constrained to links monitored by probes from at least three different ASs.

In terms of resource consumption, Tulip and CING are significantly more demanding. These methods rely on ICMP timestamps and require a large number of samples to correct for clock artifacts. For example, Tulip estimates delays using 1000 measurements per router plus an extra 500 measurements for packet loss estimation [30]. In contrast, our system requires as few as nine packets per router and utilizes existing traceroute data, adding no extra load to the network.

#### B. Theoretical Limitations

The sensitivity of our approach in detecting abnormal delay changes depends primarily on the size of the time bin, which is influenced by probe deployment and probing rate. A link is monitored only if it is traversed by vantage points within at least three different ASs (Section 4.3). Since traceroute sends three packets per hop, we expect at least \( m = 3 \times 3 \) packets per time bin for a link. Therefore, the number of vantage points monitoring a link and their probing rate \( r \) (i.e., number of traceroutes per hour) determine the minimum usable time bin \( T_{\text{min}} = \frac{m}{3rn} \).

Intuitively, experiments with many probes or a high probing rate would permit the use of shorter time bins. Let \( T \geq T_{\text{min}} \) be the selected time bin; then \( 3rnT \) is the expected number of packets obtained for a link per time bin. Since our approach relies on the median, 50% of these packets should be impacted by an event to be detected. In other words, an event is detected if it affects more than \( 1 + \frac{3rnT}{2} \) packets within a time bin. Consequently, the smallest detectable event in hours is:

\[
\frac{1}{3rn} \left(1 + \frac{3rnT}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{3rn} + \frac{T}{2}
\]

In Section 7, we analyze built-in measurements that initiate traceroute every 30 minutes (\( r = 2 \) traceroutes per hour), thus the minimum usable time bin is \( T_{\text{min}} = 0.5 \) hour. In our experiments, we conservatively set the time bin \( T = 1 \) hour. According to Equation 11, the shortest event we can detect for a link monitored by three vantage points (\( n = 3 \)) is 33 minutes. With the higher probing rate of anchoring measurements (\( r = 4 \)), one could detect events lasting only nine minutes with this dataset.
