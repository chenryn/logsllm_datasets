### 7.3 Analysis

Figure 5 presents the results of our CAT (Congestion-Aware Tor) simulations, comparing the performance with and without a relay adversary under a typical user model. Figure 5a shows that while CAT slightly reduces the time to first compromise, the difference is minimal. This is expected because congestion awareness influences circuit selection but does not affect the choice of entry guards, which are the primary factor in determining the time to first compromise. However, congestion awareness does impact the circuits used over time, which in turn affects the total fraction of compromised streams. Figure 5b illustrates a more significant increase in the total number of compromised streams. This is likely due to less congested adversarial relays biasing the client's circuit choices towards those controlled by the adversary.

This behavior introduces a new attack vector: an adversary can manipulate the client's circuit choices by increasing the response time for circuits they control but have not yet compromised. This active attack is similar to selective denial of service but is much harder to detect, and thus it falls outside the scope of our adversary model. Similar conclusions were drawn from the results of the BitTorrent and IRC user models.

### 8. Conclusion

In this paper, we present a realistic and comprehensive analysis of the security of Tor against traffic correlation. Our approach carefully defines adversaries and uses them to define security metrics that capture user security over time. We propose adversaries that control one or more fixed Autonomous Systems (ASes) or Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). We introduce new, practical security metrics that, for the first time, show how long a user can remain anonymous and how often an adversary can de-anonymize them.

We developed several tools and techniques to evaluate our security metrics on the live Tor network. These include models of user activity online, an up-to-date and comprehensive Internet map with BGP routes, and a model of relay congestion based on full-network simulations with Shadow.

Our results indicate that Tor faces even greater risks from traffic correlation than previous studies suggested. An adversary providing no more bandwidth than some current volunteers can de-anonymize any given user within three months of regular Tor use with over 50% probability and within six months with over 80% probability. We observe that using BitTorrent is particularly unsafe, and long-lived ports bear a large security cost for their performance needs. We also find that the Congestion-Aware Tor proposal exacerbates these vulnerabilities.

Some of our results against an adversary controlling ASs or IXPs are similarly concerning. Some users experience over a 95% chance of compromise within three months against a single AS or IXP. Users' security varies significantly with their location, but an adversary with additional ASes or IXPs can compromise even those in "safer" locations at a much higher rate. Such an adversary is highly relevant in today's setting, where many large organizations control multiple ASes or IXPs. Surprisingly, high destination diversity may actually improve security against a network adversary.

These results are somewhat discouraging for the current security of the Tor network. However, they suggest several ways to significantly improve security. For example, reducing the default number of guards would immediately cut compromise rates. Increasing the guard expiration time, which currently starts after 30 days, would also significantly delay the time to first compromise. Elahi et al. [16] report some results on how such changes in guard selection can improve security. Improving security against the network adversary is more challenging, but several proposals have been made [15, 19, 28]. We suggest evaluating these defenses using our methodology and designing new solutions with our adversary models and security metrics in mind.

Our results suggest that current Tor users should carefully consider whether it meets their security needs, especially those facing persistent adversaries who might run relays or monitor network traffic. While improved defenses are being developed, such users may take defensive measures on their own, such as manually configuring their client to limit the selection of relays. Johnson et al. [27] suggest an approach that balances per-client trust with blending in with other clients.

The goal of our analysis is to inform safer use of Tor and inspire more secure designs. Despite our pessimistic results, Tor has provided real and valuable privacy to thousands of users. We are optimistic that it can continue and improve this service.
