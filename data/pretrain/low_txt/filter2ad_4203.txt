### Dependability on the Last Frontier

**Author:** Alex Hills  
**Event:** International Conference on Dependable Systems & Networks, Anchorage, Alaska, June 24-27, 2008  
**Presentation Type:** First Keynote Address

#### Abstract
Alaska, often celebrated for its frontier spirit, is in fact highly dependent on technological systems and networks. These systems can be either reliable or unreliable, depending on various factors. Drawing from his 38 years of experience in "The Great Land," Dr. Alex Hills will share true and compelling stories about Alaskan systems that have proven dependable, as well as those that have fallen short.

#### Speaker Bio
**Dr. Alex Hills** is a Distinguished Service Professor at Carnegie Mellon University and the President of Alex Hills Associates, based in Palmer, Alaska. Since arriving in Alaska 38 years ago, Dr. Hills has spent seven years living and working in the remote regions, where he played a pivotal role in developing rural Alaska's broadcast and telecommunications infrastructure.

During his time in the bush, Dr. Hills served as the first full-time General Manager of KOTZ, the only radio station in northwest Alaska. He was also elected the first President of OTZ Telephone Cooperative, which provides telephone services to the region's villages. Additionally, he helped four other remote communities establish their own public radio stations.

Later in his career, at Carnegie Mellon University, Dr. Hills spearheaded the creation of the "Wireless Andrew" network, which laid the foundation for the technology now known as Wi-Fi.

Dr. Hills is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and was recently honored as the Alaska Engineer of the Year by the Alaska Engineering Societies.
