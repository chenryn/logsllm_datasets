#### Figure 17: Fraction of Prepended Prefixes with ROAs

We conducted our measurements from January 13th, 2020, to January 17th, 2020. In each round, we announced our prefix using two different Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) as originators. Initially, we announced the prefix via one of the PEERING Points of Presence (PoPs) to all attached upstreams using AS61574 as the originator, with 0, 1, 2, or 3 prepends. Fifteen minutes later, we announced the same prefix via a second PEERING PoP to all its upstreams without prepends, using AS61575. Thirty minutes after the second announcement, we withdrew all routes for the prefix. We repeated the experiment 30 minutes later, using a different combination of PoPs and/or number of prepends.

The PoPs were selected based on their location and the number of upstreams: Amsterdam (44), Seattle (33), GaTech (4), GRnet (4), and Clemson (1). To analyze the impact of prefix hijacking, we examined the fraction of BGP monitors that adopted the "hijacked route" via AS61575.

**Figure 16** shows the fraction of monitors that adopted the hijacked route per pair of PoPs and prepend size. The results confirm the intuition that the likelihood of successful prefix hijacking increases with the number of prepends. Overall, if the initial announcement used three prepends, at least 94% of the monitors adopted the hijacked route, even when the hijacking location had only a single upstream (e.g., Clemson). Connectivity plays a crucial role in the success of prefix hijacking. For all cases where we attempted to hijack the prefix from Amsterdam (a highly connected PoP), we succeeded for at least 93% of the monitors. In contrast, when we hijacked via Clemson (a poorly connected PoP), we only succeeded if the other PoP was prepending three times. Except for Clemson, all other PoPs were able to hijack routes from Seattle. Additionally, Seattle, with 33 upstreams, had less success in hijacking routes unless they had three prepends, highlighting the complexities of the Internet routing ecosystem.

Our results using a uniform prepending policy indicate how AS-Path Prepending (ASPP) can increase the success of a hijacking attempt. While in Section 5, we show that ASes uniformly prepend many prefixes, most ASes use a binary or diverse prepending policy, whereby one route is often not prepended. This means that the increased risk of hijacking only applies to the part of the Internet that chooses the prepended route.

More than 18% of prepended prefixes include apparently unnecessary prepending, which increases their exposure to hijacking and route leaks. For most prepended prefixes (169k), the minimum prepend size is 0, but many ASes originate prefixes with at least one prepend to all their neighbors, increasing their exposure to hijacks and/or route leaks. On May 4th, 2020, 6.9k ASes originated 38.5k prefixes with this characteristic (18.6% of all prepended prefixes). Among these, 29.4k/7.4k/2k used a uniform, binary, or diverse policy. All these routes contain at least one unnecessary prepend—all their policies can be implemented with less prepending (as observable at the BGP monitors). To further understand such potential risks, we analyzed the minimum prepending size for all prepended prefixes using the BGPWeekly dataset. Based on the results in **Figure 15**, we see that this finding holds over time, and the number of affected prefixes has grown.

### 7.3 RPKI-Covered Prepended Prefixes
One of the main techniques for enhancing routing security is the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). RPKI allows ASes to create Route Origination Authorizations (ROAs) for each of their prefixes, which other ASes can use to validate routes using Route Origin Validation (ROV). Although ROV cannot prevent the removal of prepends (see Section 7.1), it can protect against prefix hijacking attacks in which the hijacker alters the origin AS. Given that ASPP potentially increases the exposure during hijacking attacks, we analyzed the degree to which prepended prefixes are protected by ROAs.

Most prepended prefixes are not covered by ROAs. Using the ROAS dataset, we checked which of the prepended prefixes in the BGPWeekly dataset have a ROA object. **Figure 17** shows the coverage by ROAs of all prefixes in which all alternatives contain prepends and those without prepends.

First, we observe that the fraction of prefixes covered by ROAs has been increasing in recent years. However, no more than 25% of the prefixes in each prepending class have ROAs. This indicates that most prepended prefixes are not even partially protected against prefix hijacking attacks, regardless of the minimum number of prepends.

### Discussion
Our security-related results confirmed the assumptions shared by most network operators. Nevertheless, some operators argued that achieving a specific traffic distribution may be more important to some ASes than reducing the potential impact of prefix hijacks, especially with the added security due to the increasing deployment of ROV.

### 8. Related Work
Previous studies have focused on characterizing ASPP, understanding its effectiveness, and pointing out possible security aspects.

**Characterization:** To understand the characteristics of ASPP, previous work analyzed the views of ISPs [25], IXPs [10], and route collectors [11, 27, 67, 77]. Since their numbers were inconsistent, we refreshed and extended their findings by performing a 10-year analysis of the main properties of ASPP. Our work is the first to focus on prepending policies rather than just utilization rates.

**Effectiveness:** Swinnen et al. found—in simulations based on a degree-based network model—that ASPP cannot always move all traffic [64]. This finding was later confirmed in 2004 by Quoitin et al. when running measurements from a single vantage point connected to two upstreams [50] (similar to our effectiveness measurements). Unlike their methodologies, we emulated and tested more than 100 real-world location combinations and showed that the effectiveness of ASPP varies substantially by location and the number of upstreams through which an AS announces the prepended prefix.

**Security:** Zhang et al. analyzed the potential of interception-attacks exploiting ASPP based on simulations on an AS Graph extracted from the public BGP data of RouteViews and RIPE RIS [76]. They showed that well-connected ASes (e.g., Tier-1 ASes) are less prone to this type of attack and that longer prepends amplify their risks. We actively measured the security impact of ASPP based on hijack emulations from various locations and experiments to identify ASes that remove prepends. We also observed that 18.6% of prepended prefixes have unnecessary prepend sizes that increase their exposure to attacks.

### 9. Final Remarks
Despite mixed opinions about ASPP in the networking community, we find that ASPP is still widely used on the Internet, and its utilization is slightly increasing. Surprised by this, we consulted with operators and found that the main reasons are the simplicity of ASPP and the fact that it does not have any prerequisites. Our analysis of ASPP reveals that prepending policies are mostly stable over time; ASes use a wide range of policies when announcing their prefixes, and prepend sizes are becoming polarized—with either one or more than three prepends.

We unexpectedly found many ASes uniformly prepending all their prefixes to all neighbors, hence not influencing any remote routing decision. Through conversations with operators, we identified poor housekeeping of BGP configurations, limited knowledge about BGP, and a desire for stability as the possible leading causes. Our complementary analyses with traceroutes and cross-checks with CDN data confirm that the limited visibility of public route collector projects cannot explain most of our observations.

During our interviews, many operators pointed out that using ASPP suffices to accomplish their Inter-AS Traffic Engineering (ITE) goals. Our active measurements confirm that ASPP is effective—since even small prepend sizes can steer the traffic of multiple routes—if used with many upstreams. When using only two upstreams, ASPP's effectiveness is dependent on the AS location.

We also discuss the security implications of ASPP. First, we show through active measurements that some ASes remove prepends, but it appears to be rare at the moment. Second, we find that ASPP can increase the spread of prefix hijacks, as the hijacked route is more attractive to a larger fraction of ASes. Third, we detect that ASes originate 18% of the prepended prefixes with unnecessary prepends.

ASPP has value, and ASes are using it extensively on the Internet. However, as Internet paths are getting shorter (as the core is getting denser), the need for large prepend sizes is decreasing. Given the security implications of large prepends and the fact that small prepends are often sufficient for moving traffic, we recommend that network operators review their prepending policies, removing unnecessary prepends and using small prepend sizes when performing ITE.
