# Hypergiants' Off-Net Footprints and Growth: A Seven-Year Analysis

## Introduction
This section discusses the footprint and growth of hypergiants' (HGs) off-net deployments. We analyze their expansion by network type, region, and coverage of Internet users. Additionally, we provide insights into the network providers' hosting strategies for HGs.

## 6.1 Hypergiant Statistics

### Data Source and Methodology
We use the Rapid7 certificate dataset to analyze the number of IP addresses with valid certificates from October 2013 to April 2021. We report the raw data and then apply our methodology (§4.1-§4.3) to infer the IP addresses associated with any of the HGs. In Figure 2, we plot the percentage of IP addresses serving any of the HGs, either hosted in an HG AS or a non-HG AS.

At the start of 2021, only around 3.8% of the IP addresses with valid certificates in the Rapid7 dataset were associated with any of the HGs we studied, either hosted in one of the HGs' ASes or in a non-HG AS, potentially indicating HG off-nets.

### Table 3: HGs' Off-Net Footprint
Table 3 reports the number of ASes hosting each HG's off-net footprint at the beginning (October 2013) and end (April 2021) of our study period, validated with headers (§4.5). The middle columns show the maximum number of ASes observed hosting off-nets for a HG and the timestamp when that maximum deployment occurred. The table ranks HGs based on their maximum AS footprint.

For half of the HGs (Microsoft, Hulu, Disney, Yahoo!, Chinacache, Fastly, Cachefly, Incapsula, CDN77, Bamtech, and Highwinds), our methodology inferred no off-net footprint during the study period, so they are excluded from the table.

### Deployment Strategies
The deployment strategies of HGs differ. In Section 5, we explained that the absolute number of IP addresses is a good comparison metric. For some HGs, such as Google, Netflix, and Facebook, a high percentage of IP addresses with certificates were hosted in non-HG ASes. However, the total number of IP addresses is only a small percentage of the dataset of IP addresses with certificates.

There are two distinct groups of HGs. The four largest HGs—Google, Netflix, Facebook, and Akamai—have off-nets in more than 1,000 ASes at the beginning of 2021. For some HGs, like Google and Akamai, the size of the off-net footprint with server installations (after validation with headers) is very close to the service-present off-net footprint (as inferred by certificates alone; see values in parentheses). For others, like Alibaba, this is not the case, as they rely on servers operated by other HGs or datacenter providers.

Cloudflare poses an interesting case. Our manual investigation reveals that it does not have an off-net footprint, but because it issues and installs certificates in clients operating in other networks (and to support its DNS service 1.1.1.1), Cloudflare is misidentified as having off-nets.

## 6.2 Longitudinal Growth

### Top-4 HGs' Off-Net Footprint Growth
Figure 3 plots the off-net footprint growth (after validation with HTTP(S) headers) of the top-4 HGs (Google, Netflix, Facebook, and Akamai) based on our analysis of the Rapid7 certificate dataset. The off-net footprint of these HGs is growing substantially, with the exception of Akamai. Facebook has shown rapid growth since launching its own CDN in the summer of 2016 [61].

#### Netflix's Case
Netflix's off-net footprint grew consistently after 2015, possibly due to peering disputes with ISPs [72] and the strategic decision to launch Open Connect. However, we observed a significant fraction of IP addresses responding with an expired certificate after April 2017. This is visible in Figure 3 (solid line). When we ignore the expiration date of this certificate, we can restore the activity of Netflix as shown by the dashed line. In October 2019, the default certificate of these IP addresses changed back to a valid one, which we validate using PTR records.

We also observed that 26.8% of the IP addresses serving a certificate for Netflix before April 2017 and after July 2019 stopped responding to HTTPS requests on port 443. Further investigation using Rapid7 data showed that these IP addresses were active during this period but on HTTP instead of HTTPS. We conjecture that Netflix moved from HTTPS to HTTP to cope with high demand, as encryption requires additional resources, a challenge Netflix has admitted [99]. By restoring these IP addresses, we plot the number of ASes that hosted Netflix off-nets between October 2017 and November 2019 (dotted line).

## 6.3 Growth by Network Type

### AS Customer Cone Size
We are interested in understanding the "demographics" of ASes that host HGs. We label ASes that host HGs based on their AS customer cone size, using the CAIDA AS Relationships Dataset. We categorize ASes into five categories: Stub (no customer cone), Small (≤ 10 ASes), Medium (≤ 100 ASes), Large (≤ 1000 ASes), and XLarge (> 1000 ASes).

In Figure 5, we plot the top-4 HGs' off-net footprint in the form of stacked bars. Each bar refers to one of the AS categories: Stub, Small, Medium, Large, and XLarge. Smaller ASes (Stub, Small, and Medium) contribute most (between 93-96%) to the growth of Google, Netflix, and Facebook. For Akamai’s off-net footprint, the contribution of Stub ASes declines since 2018, while the contribution of Small and Medium ASes remains the same. The sum of the three categories remains high, reaching 84%.

To better understand the dynamics, we compute the number of ASes in the entire CAIDA dataset for all categories from 2013-2021. Even though the number of active ASes has increased from around 45k in 2013 to more than 71k in 2021, the percentage of ASes in each category is surprisingly stable. Specifically, Stub ASes are the most numerous, with around 85% of all ASes being Stubs. Small ASes are also common, around 12% of all ASes. The rest of the categories are smaller. Medium ASes have a share of 2.6%, Large ASes less than 0.5%, and XLarge ASes less than 0.1%. These differences highlight that the demographics of ASes that host the top HGs do not agree with the overall demographics of ASes in the Internet. In the case of Akamai’s off-net footprint, the percentage of Stub ASes is even smaller, 13%. Although the share of Large and XLarge ASes in the Internet is a bit more than 0.5%, more than 5% of the ASes that host HGs belong to this category (over 16% in the case of Akamai). Deploying in these large ASes can help HGs serve many users, a subject we elaborate on in Section 6.5.

## 6.4 Regional Growth

### Mapping ASes to Countries
To investigate the HGs' off-net footprint growth in different regions, we assign each AS to one country. We are aware that this may be misleading, especially for XLarge and Large ASes, as they may operate in multiple countries. However, studying a snapshot of the APNIC dataset [65], we observe that 95% of the 26K ASes included in this dataset have only one country of operation. To map ASes to countries, we used CAIDA’s AS Organizations Dataset [20], resulting in an AS-to-country dataset that spans 7 years and covers 99.9% of the ASes in our study. We compare our AS-to-country dataset with the APNIC dataset and find they agree for 97% of overlapping ASes. However, the APNIC dataset includes many fewer ASes.

The mapping of ASes to countries/regions may be influenced by geopolitics. For example, Hong Kong may appear as part of China. Figures 6d, 6e, and 6f present areas with lower growth, i.e., North America, Africa, and Oceania. The off-net footprint growth of Google, Netflix, and Facebook is between 200 and 400 ASes in North America, 60-150 ASes in Africa, and 20-30 ASes in Oceania. We attribute this to consolidation in the network market in North America and the relatively small network market in Africa and Oceania. Nevertheless, both Google’s and Facebook’s off-net footprints include many ASes in Africa. Appendix A.7 investigates the growth of off-net footprints per network type in different regions.

We also noticed a slowdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, but growth continued when the economy opened again in Summer 2020 and especially in the first months of 2021. Anecdotal evidence confirms that additional capacity was allocated in peerings during the pandemic (e.g., for Facebook [63]), as it was more difficult to increase capacity at off-nets inside eyeball networks, which can require sending engineers in the field during the lockdown.

## 6.5 Internet User Population Coverage

Next, we estimate the coverage of the Internet user population in a country that can access HGs services located inside their networks.
