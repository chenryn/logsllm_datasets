**Title: Botconf 2017 - Malware Uncertainty Principle: Alteration of Malware Behavior by Close Observation**

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the use of HTTPS by malware. The exact reasons for this trend are not yet fully understood, but it is hypothesized that it may be due to organizations allowing only web traffic to the Internet, and the fact that using HTTPS makes malware traffic appear more similar to legitimate connections. As a result, there is growing interest in understanding how malware utilizes HTTPS.

This paper presents our research on capturing large volumes of real-world malware traffic that uses HTTPS. We employed man-in-the-middle (MITM) HTTPS interceptor proxies to decrypt and analyze the content of this traffic. Our primary objective was to study how the behavior of malware changes when its traffic is intercepted.

Our findings indicate that the use of an interceptor proxy in a network can significantly alter the behavior of malware. Therefore, the deployment of such proxies should be carefully considered, as they can have unintended consequences on the detection and analysis of malicious activities.
