### Abstract
The objective is to analyze textures in breast histopathology images for cancer diagnosis. Breast cancer has the second-highest mortality rate among women. Early detection can provide more treatment options and reduce mortality. Traditional histopathological methods, which rely on cell morphology and tissue distribution, are time-consuming and sometimes lead to incorrect diagnoses. New techniques use computers, archived data, and standard algorithms to provide fast and accurate results. This work proposes a multiresolution statistical model in the wavelet domain, emphasizing the contribution of Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM) and related higher-order statistical features. The images are taken from the 'BreaKHis' database. The GLRLM feature dataset is classified using an SVM classifier with a linear kernel. The classification accuracies of single-resolution and multiresolution analyses are compared. The results show that GLRLM-based features provide exceptional distinguishing features for multiresolution analysis of histopathology images. This model will be suitable for cancer detection and offers an innovative way to extract underlying information in breast cancer images.

### 1. Introduction
Breast cancer is a significant health concern, with many women being diagnosed at later stages due to delayed detection. Early and accurate diagnosis can improve treatment outcomes. This study aims to automate the diagnosis by analyzing digitalized histopathology images in the multiresolution domain of wavelet subbands. The subbands are used to extract GLRLM features, which are then classified using an SVM classifier. The rest of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of histopathology image analysis, Section 3 describes the methodology, and Section 4 presents the experimental results. Section 5 concludes the study.

### 2. Histopathology
Histopathology is the study of diseased tissues. It involves the examination of whole tissue sections, while cytopathology focuses on the nucleus of cells within the tissue. The preparation of tissue slides includes several steps: tissue collection, fixation, embedding, sectioning, and staining. Standard staining protocols, such as Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) and Immunohistochemical (IHC), enhance the visibility of cellular structures.

#### 2.1. Tissue Preparation: Virtual Slide
Tissue preparation is crucial for histopathology image analysis. The process includes tissue collection, fixation, embedding, sectioning, and staining. The tissue is fixed with paraffin wax, embedded, and sliced into thin sections (approximately 3.5 µm). These sections are placed on glass slides and stained to improve visibility.

#### 2.2. Image Dataset ‘BreakHis’ - Breast Cancer Histopathological Database
The 'BreakHis' database, a collaboration between the P&DLaboratory and Pathological Anatomy and Cytopathology, Parana, Brazil, contains 9109 microscopic images of breast tumor tissue from 82 patients. The images are available at different magnification scales (×2, ×4, ×10, ×20, and ×40). Images at ×20 magnification (0.049 mm/pixel) were used for analysis. The dataset is divided into benign and malignant tumors. Benign tumors are non-invasive, while malignant tumors grow rapidly and invade nearby organs.

### 3. Methodology

#### 3.1. Medical Image Analysis
Medical image analysis is a non-invasive tool for detecting and diagnosing diseases accurately and efficiently. Techniques include image acquisition, storage, presentation, restoration, and communication. Common imaging modalities include microscopy, endoscopy, radiography, X-ray imaging, CT, MRI, ultrasound, PET, and mammography.

#### 3.2. Histopathology Image Processing
Image analysis using computers involves image acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Pre-processing improves image quality by removing noise and enhancing spatial information. Feature extraction represents the image using morphological, textural, and statistical features. These features are used to identify and quantify deformities, and the classification step categorizes them into different classes.

#### 3.3. Multiresolution Analysis (Wavelet Filters)
Multiresolution image modeling techniques have gained popularity in cancer research due to better computational resources and faster algorithms. Single-resolution analysis is limited in interpreting interactions between pixels in heterogeneous, nonlinear, and long-range textural patterns. In the wavelet domain, a long-range correlation model can be constructed with simpler models, reducing computational effort. The wavelet function, introduced by Mallat, offers a mathematical tool to extract scale-dependent and location-dependent structures in breast cancer histopathology images. A 2-dimensional wavelet transform can be implemented using digital filtering followed by sub-sampling.

### 4. Experimental Results
The results show that GLRLM-based features provide exceptional distinguishing features for multiresolution analysis of histopathology images. This model is suitable for cancer detection and offers an innovative way to extract underlying information in breast cancer images.

### 5. Conclusion
This work proposes an automated diagnosis method for breast cancer. The model focuses on long-range spatial dependencies in heterogeneous spatial processes and offers solutions for accurate classification in two-class problems. The use of GLRLM-based textural features provides a robust and efficient approach to extract underlying information in breast cancer images.
