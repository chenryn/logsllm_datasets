**Title: BotConf 2015 - BoxBotNet**

A hosted box botnet is a network of compromised web servers, often exploiting vulnerabilities in content management systems (CMS) on low-cost hosting services. Over the past year, I have been tracking an Indonesian group that operates this type of botnet and resells access to these compromised servers. What is particularly noteworthy about this botnet is its self-expanding nature: once a server is compromised, it automatically seeks out and compromises other servers, thereby growing the botnet.
