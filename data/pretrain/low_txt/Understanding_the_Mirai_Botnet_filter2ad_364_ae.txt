### 6000 Times Faster
The Witty worm scanned at an even faster rate of 3 megabytes/second [81], which suggests that Mirai was primarily powered by devices with limited computational capacity and/or located in regions with low bandwidth [3].

### 5. Ownership and Evolution

#### 5.1 Public Release and Variant Emergence
Following the public release of Mirai’s source code in late September 2016, multiple competing variants of the botnet emerged. We analyze the Command and Control (C2) infrastructure behind Mirai to uncover the relationships between these strains, their relative sizes, and the evolution of their capabilities.

#### 5.2 C2 Infrastructure Analysis
To identify the structure of Mirai's C2 servers, we utilized both active and passive DNS data. By clustering C2 IPs and domains based on shared network infrastructure, and starting with the two IPs and 67 domains collected from reverse-engineered Mirai binaries, we identified 33 independent C2 clusters with no shared infrastructure. These clusters ranged from a single host to the largest, which contained 112 C2 domains and 92 IP addresses. The connectivity of the top six clusters, based on the number of C2 domains, is shown in Figure 7. The lack of shared infrastructure between these clusters supports the idea that there were multiple active bot operators during our study period.

- **Majority of Probes**: Scanned below 250 Bps for over 2,700 seconds.

- **Cluster Characteristics**: Labeled with observed evolutionary patterns and associated attacks.

While we cannot conclusively link each cluster to distinct operators, the use of independent DNS infrastructure and evolving malware underscores the challenge of defending against these attacks through bespoke mitigations. Our results also confirm recent findings by Lever et al., who observed that the naming infrastructure used by malware is often active weeks before its operation [54]. For example, the first lookup of a C2 domain in cluster 2 occurred on August 1, 2016, significantly predating the peak lookup on October 21, 2016, and the first binary collected on October 24, 2016. This suggests that careful analysis of DNS infrastructure can guide preventative measures.

### 5.3 Evolution
Although the Mirai ecosystem expanded rapidly after the public source code release on September 30, 2016, this was not the botnet’s first major evolutionary step. Between August 7, 2016, and September 30, 2016, 24 unique Mirai binaries were uploaded to VirusTotal, which we used to explore the botnet’s initial maturation. Key developments during this period included:
- **C2 Infrastructure Upgrade**: From IP-based to domain-based in mid-September.
- **Malware Enhancements**: Deletion of executing binary, obfuscation of process ID, addition of more passwords, closing of infection ports TCP/23 and TCP/2323, and aggressive killing of competitive malware.

After the public release, new features emerged rapidly, including improved infection capabilities and hardened binaries to slow reverse engineering efforts. Between November 2, 2016, and February 28, 2017, we observed 48 new sets of usernames and passwords, as well as changes to the IP blacklist. Variants evolved to scan for new ports (TCP/7547 and TCP/5555) and some began using domain generation algorithms (DGA), though this feature was short-lived.

### 6. Mirai’s DDoS Attacks

#### 6.1 Types of Attacks
During our five-month botnet infiltration, we observed Mirai operators issuing 15,194 DDoS attack commands, excluding duplicates. These attacks employed various resource exhaustion strategies:
- **Volumetric Attacks**: 32.8%
- **TCP State Exhaustion**: 39.8%
- **Application-Layer Attacks**: 34.5%

This breakdown differs from the current landscape of DDoS attacks, where 65% are volumetric, 18% attempt TCP state exhaustion, and 18% are higher-level application attacks. Despite built-in support for bandwidth amplification, only 2.8% of Mirai attack commands relied on this method, highlighting its substantial capabilities despite the resource constraints of the devices involved.

- **Attack Types and Targets**: Detailed breakdown of the 15,194 attacks, including application-layer, volumetric, and TCP state exhaustion attacks.

#### 6.2 Attack Targets
Studying the victims targeted by Mirai provides insight into its operators. In total, we observed 15,194 attacks issued by 484 C2 IPs, overlapping with 24 DNS clusters. The attacks targeted 5,046 victims, comprising 4,730 individual IPs, 196 subnets, and 120 domain names. These victims ranged from game servers, telecoms, and anti-DDoS providers to political websites and relatively obscure Russian sites.

**Table 10: Victim Breakdown**
- **Targets**: Ranging from game servers, telecoms, and anti-DDoS providers to political websites and obscure Russian sites.

Mirai's source code supports targeting of IPv4 subnets, spreading DDoS firepower across entire network ranges. We observed 654 attacks (4.3%) targeting one or more subnets, with the most frequently targeted being Psychz Networks (102 attacks, 0.7%), a data center offering dedicated servers and DDoS mitigation services, and two subnets belonging to Lonestar Cell (65 combined attacks, 0.4%), a Liberian telecom. There was also evidence of attacks targeting large swathes of the IPv4 address space indiscriminately.
