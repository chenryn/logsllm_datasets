# Botnets and IRC: An Overview

## Malicious Activities
- **Selling Advertisements**
- **Manipulating Online Polls**
- **Sending Spam Emails**
- **Phishing**
- **Renting Bots**
- **Information Loss/Identity Theft/Sniffing**
- **Stealing CD-Keys and Online Game Goods**

## IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
### Introduction
- **IRC** is one of the earliest forms of online chat, established in 1993.
- **RFCs**: 1459, 2810, 2811, 2812, 2813
- **Real-time Communication**: Users can chat in channels in real time.
- **Channel Management** (RFC 2811, 2000)
  - **Channel Operator (+o)**
  - **Private (flag p) and Secret (flag s) Channels**
  - **Channel Topic (/topic #chan_name topic)**
  - **Channel Key (+k)**
  - **Banning Users**
- **CTCP/DCC (1994)**: Additional communication protocols.

### IRC Bots
- **Definition**: Programs that enforce channel policies.
- **Functions**:
  - Ban users for specific keywords.
  - Manage user levels.
  - Prevent flooding.
  - React to certain events.
- **Examples**:
  - Eggdrop
  - Perlbot
  - ircII script bot
  - mIRC script bot
- **Advanced Bots**:
  - P2P file sharing.
  - Gamebots and Talkbots.
  - Google bots and Sysbots.

### mIRC Bot Examples
- **Sysbot**:
  - `/load -rs SystemInfo.mrc`
  - `/ctcp sysbot systeminfo`
- **Google bot**:
  - P2P file sharing.

## How Bots Work
### Connecting to the Controller
1. **Connect to the Bot Controller (IRC Server)**:
   - `/server xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx serverpass`
2. **Enter Specific Channel with Password**:
   - Interpret the channel topic as a command.
3. **Bot List**:
   - Bots performing the same action in the channel.
   - Compromising other hosts using MS-0411 LSASS vulnerability.
4. **Hacker Control**:
   - Redirect bots to other channels or servers.

### Channel Modes
- **+s (Secret)**: The channel is not visible in the list.
- **+u (Hidden Userlist)**: The user list is hidden.
- **+m (Moderated)**: Only users with operator (@) access or +v voice can send messages.
- **+k (Key Required)**: A key is needed to enter the channel.

### Scanning and Spreading
- **Scanning for Vulnerabilities or Victims**:
  - Scan for SWAT (Samba Web Administration Tool) on port 901.

### Hiding the Bot Controller
- **Dynamic DNS**:
  - Specific IRC servers are set in the bot.
  - Bot owner uses Dynamic DNS to hide the controller and save bandwidth.
  - Bot will not connect if:
    - Network signal is lost.
    - Server name resolves to 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1.

- **Changing the Controller**:
  - Hacker can change the controller when a new victim is found.
  - Migration of bots over time.

## Variants of Bots
- **Agobot/Phatbot/Gaobot/XtremBot**:
  - Written in C++ with modular scalability.
  - Public under GPL, improved by many users.
  - Features rootkit technologies and debugger detection.
  - Developed by Ago alias Wonk, arrested in May 2004 for computer crime.
- **SDBot/RBot/UrBot/UrXBot**:
  - Written in C, with poor design.

- **mIRC-based Bots (GT-Bots)**:
  - Launch an instance of mIRC with scripts (.mrc) and binaries.
  - Symptoms include hiding mIRC processes and changing filenames.

### Writing Your Own Bot
- **mIRC Script â€“ Remote Event**:
  - Create scripts that react to IRC server events.
  - Example:
    - `on 1:TEXT:hello*:#:/msg $chan Welcome!!!! to $chan $nick!`
    - `ctcp ^*:DO:*:{ . $+ $2- | .halt }`

## Virus Kits and Bot Generators
- **Virus Kits**:
  - Agobot Config GUI for configuration generation.
  - VBS Worm Generator.

## Functions Inside a Bot
- **Modular Design**:
  - Easy to add new features.
- **Scanner Modules**:
  - Automated infection mechanisms.
- **Update Modules**:
  - Fetch and install the latest bot program.
- **DoS Modules**:
  - SYN, UDP, ICMP floods, password brute forcers.
- **Harvest Modules**:
  - Steal CD-keys, specific information, and use keyloggers.

## Protect Mechanisms
- **Rootkit**:
  - Hide processes.
- **Bot.secure**:
  - Fix vulnerabilities, close shares, remove viruses, and disable DCOM.

## Tracking and Combating Botnets
- **DDoS**:
  - No perfect solution.
- **Know Your Enemy**:
  - Understand botnets to survive.
- **Intranet Bots**:
  - Connect to the same bot controller.
  - Use NIDS signatures in gateway and DNS areas.
- **DDoS Attacks**:
  - Ask the ISP for help.

### Releasing Bots
- **Steps**:
  - Get the server/channel key from a compromised bot.
  - Get the authentication of the botnet controller.
  - Stop and release all bots.
- **Ethical Considerations**:
  - Unauthorized actions may be illegal.

### Conclusion
- **Active Phishing Scams**:
  - New threat of phishing attacks.
- **User Education**:
  - Essential but challenging.
- **Future of IRC**:
  - Not the only control mechanism for botnets.
- **Knowledge is Power**:
  - Understanding your enemy increases your chances of catching them.
