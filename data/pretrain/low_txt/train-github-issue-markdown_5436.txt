### Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

I would like to propose the addition of a fuzzy search functionality for Control Panel tasks, similar to the search feature available in the Start Menu. This enhancement would allow users to quickly find and access specific Control Panel tasks by entering relevant keywords.

For example:
- Searching for "partition" should return **Create and format hard disk partitions**, which would then direct the user to **Disk Management**.
- Typing "users" should display **Add, edit, or remove other users**.

This feature would significantly improve the usability and efficiency of the Control Panel by enabling users to locate and execute tasks more easily.
