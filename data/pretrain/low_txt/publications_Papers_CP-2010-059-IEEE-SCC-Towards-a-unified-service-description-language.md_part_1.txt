## Abstract
The integration of entire application suites through Multi-Enterprise Business Process Platforms (e.g., e2open) is becoming increasingly prevalent. Simultaneously, platforms are being offered as services to reduce in-house efforts for B2B interoperability, such as message translation provided by Crossgate and Sterling Commerce. Industries are seeking efficient ways to access and integrate services on a global scale. The European Council has approved a directive to facilitate cross-border market access for services, potentially increasing service consumption by 0.6% (â‚¬37 billion). A key technological question is how the Internet can support a genuine market for cross-border services. This paper introduces USDL (Unified Service Description Language), a specification language that describes services from business, operational, and technical perspectives. USDL plays a crucial role in the Internet of Services (IoS) by describing tradable services advertised in electronic marketplaces. The language has been tested using two service marketplaces as use cases.

## 1. Introduction
Service-oriented Architectures (SOA) and Web services have primarily served as technological solutions, enabling enterprise functionality to be made available as shared and reusable services over a network. While many Web services externalize business functionalities, existing specification languages like WSDL and BPEL focus only on the technical characteristics of services. For enterprises, the true value of services is realized when their business nature and characteristics are appropriately described and aligned with the IT perspective. 

The concept of business services has gained renewed importance with the rise of business intermediaries creating new market opportunities outside traditional company boundaries. For example, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) ventures, such as Salesforce.com, leverage electronic marketplaces to compete against traditional software vendors. This trend highlights the need for a more comprehensive description of services, including business, operational, and technical aspects.

This paper presents the Unified Service Description Language (USDL), which aims to capture the business and operational nature of services and align them with the technical perspective. USDL complements the current Web service stack and is used to describe business services in IoS applications. Although completeness is not claimed, USDL provides a structured way to understand and describe the fundamental characteristics of business services.

## 2. Service Marketplaces
### 2.1 Early Intermediaries
The first intermediaries were public software registries, providing single-stop brokerage of Web services from diverse sources. Despite support from major organizations, these registries declined after a few years, such as the UDDI Business Registry operated by Microsoft, IBM, and SAP from 2000 to 2006. This decline was due to the inadequacy of service metadata in facilitating independent discovery of services by consumers, as well as the absence of critical non-functional aspects related to service delivery.

### 2.2 One-Stop Citizen and Constituency Services
One-stop citizen and constituency services, such as DirectGov.uk and usa.gov, provide centralized channels for accessing government services. These platforms aim to improve efficiency, transparency, and community building, with an emphasis on cost savings and political incentives rather than revenue generation. They offer general service descriptions and facilitate functions like single-point payment and service tracking.

### 2.3 Business Service Marketplaces
Business service marketplaces, such as American Express Intelligent Online Marketplace (AXIOM), Intel Business Exchange, and IBM SmartMarket, are centrally governed by dominant commercial players. These marketplaces offer a wide range of services, often described using structured and unstructured text. Key features include pay-per-use pricing, commission fees, and referral rewards. The dominant player benefits from increased revenue by offering a wide choice and best deals for consumers, while partners gain greater market visibility.

## 3. Describing Business Services with USDL
### 3.1 Business Perspective
USDL includes a business-sensitive perspective, marking a paradigm shift from IT to the enterprise. This shift signals an evolution from a Web service orientation to a business service orientation, linking IT to business goals, strategies, and objectives. The business perspective of USDL empowers service providers to describe and publish their services by detailing business, operational, and technical (BOT) characteristics, enabling consumers to discover and select services.

### 3.2 Operational Perspective
The operational perspective in USDL is particularly important when multiple participants are involved in service provision. USDL identifies three major roles: Provider, Consumers, and Partners. The Provider class includes organizational information and the identity of the responsible person. Consumers are described using profiles, and depending on the use case, they may be humans or enterprise systems. The Partner class models associations between a provider and other organizations involved in service provisioning, such as partnerships and alliances.

### 3.3 Technical Perspective
The technical perspective in USDL builds on existing research and standards, such as WSDL, WSMO, and OWL-S. It includes details on technical protocols, performance, dependability, security, and service levels. This perspective ensures that the technical and implementation aspects of services are well-defined and aligned with the business and operational perspectives.

### 3.4 Legal Perspective
The legal perspective in USDL addresses the legal aspects of service provision and consumption. This includes service level agreements (SLAs), terms of use, and legal constraints. SLAs define conditions of operation and mutual obligations, and if violated, all partners rely on the terms of use to justify penalties. USDL allows for the inclusion of operational constraints based on different situations and the monitoring of SLAs during execution.

## 4. Conclusion
USDL is a unified service description language that bridges the gap between business, operational, and technical perspectives. It facilitates the description of services in a structured and comprehensive manner, enabling the discovery, selection, and integration of services with minimal manual interaction. By addressing the requirements of variability, bundling, multiple views, non-functional conformance, and extensibility, USDL provides a robust framework for the Internet of Services. The language has been tested in real-world scenarios, demonstrating its potential to support the development of a genuine market for cross-border services.
