**Abstract:**
The Internet of Services (IoS) introduces new requirements for service engineering, addressing both business and technical perspectives. The complexity of emerging services necessitates new approaches for effective and efficient service design. This chapter introduces the Integrated Service Engineering (ISE) framework and its ISE workbench, which can address the emerging requirements of IoS. The chapter presents the foundations of the service engineering process, applying the separation of concerns to model different service dimensions at various levels of abstraction. Additionally, three novel extensions to the ISE workbench are presented to enhance the capabilities of the service modeling process.

**Introduction:**
Several advances have been made in describing and modeling web services. Examples include the use of ontologies to describe services and interfaces (Kerrigan, 2005; Paolucci & Wagner, 2006), semantic annotation of web services (Paolucci & Wagner, 2006; Cardoso & Sheth, 2003), and the use of UML and UML extensions for web service modeling (Lopez-Sanz et al., 2008; Sadovykh et al., 2009; Dumez et al., 2008). These approaches primarily targeted the modeling of simple artifacts, such as web service interfaces composed of data inputs, outputs, and operations. Some approaches extended this to include goals, preconditions, participants, and control, but their scope and technical orientation limited their broader application.

Web services, such as WSDL or REST, are seen as IT entities. However, the Internet of Services (IoS) encompasses more than just web services; it also includes IoS-based services that require the integration of business and operational descriptions with existing IT-based descriptions. While web services define the pipeline between two companies, IoS-based services provide the business added-value of the pipeline itself, factoring in legal regulations, community ratings, service level agreements, pricing models, and payment.

Modeling IoS-based services is more complex due to their multifaceted nature, requiring the consideration of multiple aspects. To manage this complexity, we introduce the Integrated Service Engineering (ISE) framework and its workbench, which enable the structured modeling and design of IoS-based services. The ISE framework covers business, operational, and technical perspectives, providing a structured approach through the separation of concerns and a model-driven design inspired by the Zachman framework (Zachman, 1987).

In this chapter, we present the ISE framework in two main parts. The first part discusses the characteristics of IoS-based services and the basics of the ISE framework, including different service dimensions and aspects required in an engineering process. The second part presents three advanced extensions to the ISE workbench: (1) techniques for modeling service processes using pattern matching, (2) modeling of service context, and (3) Service Level Agreement (SLA) management for composite services. These extensions aim to enrich the capabilities of the service modeling process.

**Foundations:**

**Internet of Services (IoS):**
The term Internet of Services (IoS) encompasses ideas borrowed from other approaches with varying terminology. In this work, the terms (Web) Service Ecosystems and Digital Ecosystems are used synonymously with IoS. Tertiarisation describes a structural change in developed countries, shifting from an industry economy to a service economy. Drivers of this change include globalization, technological advancements, and an increasing demand for services (Peneder et al., 2003). As a result, services and the service economy play a significant role in today's and tomorrow's business. Internet marketplaces for services, such as Google Base, SalesForce.com, and SAP Business by Design, have emerged.

The vision of IoS is to evolve service orientation, making services available as tradable products on service delivery platforms (Barros & Dumas, 2006). The goal is to trade services over the Internet between different legal entities and compose complex services from existing ones, supported by IT (Janiesch et al., 2009).

**Service Taxonomy:**
Before delving into IoS definitions, this section outlines a comprehensive service taxonomy. The concept of a service is interpreted differently in business science, information science, and computer science. Baida et al. (2004) survey different definitions, leading to a taxonomy that distinguishes between business services, e-services, and technical services.

- **Business Services:** These are defined in a broad sense, encompassing sectors such as public services, healthcare, transportation, and travel. Economists categorize companies based on these definitions, where services are everything that is neither agriculture nor manufacturing (Sampson & Froehle, 2006; Teboul, 2005). Common classifications include Business-to-Business services (e.g., financing or logistics), Consumer services (e.g., banking, insurance, education), and Self services (e.g., washing salons).

- **E-Services:** Information sciences investigate how business services relate to information technology, referring to this subset as e-services (Baida et al., 2004).

- **Technical Services:** These are described as aggregations of functionalities specified in business and e-services, realized by underlying technological platforms like web services. According to the W3C Web Services Architecture Group (Booth et al., 2004), a service is defined as “an abstract resource that represents a capability of performing tasks that form a coherent functionality from the point of view of provider and requester entities.” A Web Service is a specific incarnation, defined as “a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network, with an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically WSDL).”

**Internet of Services as an Evolution of SoA toward Marketplaces:**
IoS comprises two main concepts: a network architecture that defines how services are provided and traded, and the ability to bundle services, opening new markets for small and medium enterprises (Janiesch et al., 2009). Briscoe and De Wilde (2006) see potential for optimization in the current way companies conduct business by relating biological ecosystems to business ecosystems, with the Internet as an enabler for this optimization.
