**RF-ID Gate**
- RF-ID gates can be installed at various locations, such as entrance and exit doors, stockrooms, and other critical points.

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 27
**ISO 15693 Tags**
- Each ISO 15693 tag has a unique identifier (UID).
- The UID is essential for the anti-collision algorithm when multiple tags are within the same field.
- The UID is factory-programmed and cannot be altered.
- The tag memory is divided into two main blocks:
  - **Administrative Block:**
    - Unique Identifier (UID)
    - Application Family Identifier (AFI)
    - Data Storage Format Identifier (DSFID)
  - **User Data:**
    - Can store up to 128 bytes of persistent user data.

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 28
**UID of the ISO 15693 Tag**
- **Unique Identifier Coding:**
  - Byte 7: E0h
  - Byte 6: MFR (Manufacturer Code)
  - Bytes 5-0: Serial Number

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 29
**MFR of the ISO 15693 Tag**
- **Manufacturer ID Coding:**
  - 02h: ST Microelectronics
  - 04h: Philips Semiconductors
  - 05h: Infineon Technologies AG
  - 07h: Texas Instruments
  - 16h: EM Microelectronic-Marin SA

**Memory Organization**
- **Memory Layout of the ISO 15693 Tag:**
  - Page 0: Administrative Block (Bytes 00h-03h)
  - Pages 1-63: User Data Block (Bytes 04h-3Fh)

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 31
**RF-DUMP**
- **Overview:**
  - A small tool developed by Boris Wolf and Lukas Grunwald for reading and writing ISO tags and smart labels.
  - Supports and detects nearly all smart labels.
  - Requires an ACG Compact-Flash RF-ID Reader.
  - Runs on PDAs and notebooks.
  - Free software (GPL) available at [http://www.rf-dump.org](http://www.rf-dump.org).

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 32
**The RSA Blocker-Tag Part 1**
- At CeBIT 2004, RSA Security introduced and demonstrated a "blocker-tag" designed to block any requests.
- They presented a demo with a box of drugs and a paper bag containing the blocker-tag.
- The blocker-tag was supposed to send all possible UIDs to protect customer privacy when leaving a drugstore.
- Verification of this claim using our new tool is necessary.

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 33
**The RSA Blocker-Tag Part 2**
- The pseudo-privacy feature is achieved through fake software.
- When both tags are in the RF-ID field, the RSA Demo-Application claims "BLOCKED."
- In reality, customer information remains accessible to attackers or spies.

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 34
**Attacks against Smart-Labels**
- Most smart labels lack write protection.
- The UID and administrative block cannot store the Electronic Product Code (EPC), which is stored in the user data area.
- Metadata, such as "best-before" dates, are also stored in the user data area.
- It is only a matter of time before everyone will wear at least one RF-ID tag.

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 35
**Privacy Concerns**
- RF-ID gates can be installed anywhere, raising privacy concerns.
- Competitors could read what type of underwear you wear or what else is in your shopping bag.
- Governments or other entities could track the types of books you read.
- Combined with passports or customer cards with RF-ID chips, this technology poses a significant risk to personal privacy.
- Customers become traceable to anyone with the right equipment.

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 36
**Environmental Pollution**
- If every retail packet contains an RF-ID chip, it could lead to significant environmental pollution.
- Transponders or tags may contain harmful substances.
- Non-ionizing radiation from these devices is a potential health concern.

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 37
**Technology Risks**
- Dependence on new technology introduces new risks.
- Attacks on the RF-ID infrastructure could severely impact businesses.
- This technology could provide new opportunities for terrorist attacks and create new critical infrastructure vulnerabilities.

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 38
**Real-Life Cookie**
- Similar to web cookies, a real-life cookie can be placed on someone wearing clothing with a smart label or carrying an item with a tag.
- Every time they pass an RF-ID gate or field, such as in front of a shop window, the count can be incremented.
- The next time they use their credit card, their tag can be written with a clear identifier, revealing who was looking at the shop window.
- It is also possible to check if a customer takes a product off the shelf and puts it back, allowing for instant discounts.

**The Metro Future-Store**

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 40
**The Metro Future-Store**
- Initiated by the Metro Corporation and several technology partners.
- First store to use RF-ID technology at some customer shelves.
- Uses RF-ID technology for age control on X-rated movies and for tracking palettes in stock.
- Customer cards also contain ISO tags.
- After significant protests from privacy organizations, a RF-ID deactivator was offered.
- More information is available at [http://www.future-store.org](http://www.future-store.org).

**The Metro Future-Store**

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 42
**The Metro Future-Store**
- Customers can use a Personal Shopping Assistant (PSA) to check every product they put in their shopping bag.
- Self-checkout options are available.
- Customers serve as test subjects for the new technology.
- Ideal location for the first field test of RF-Dump.

**Future-Store Test Field**

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 46
**The RFID-Deactivator**
- After checkout, Metro offers a "RFID-Deactivator" to customers.
- This device overwrites the user data area with zeros.
- The tag can be rewritten after deactivation.
- The serial ID and administrative block cannot be erased.
- At the exit gate, the tag can be instantly filled with new information.
- To use the deactivator, all user data areas must be writable in the shop, providing many opportunities for new attacks and mischief.

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 47
**Future-Store Test Field**

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 48
**Chaos in the Future-Store**
- You can convert the EPC of cream cheese to that of shampoo, causing the store computer to believe the cream cheese is misplaced.
- Place the cream cheese in the shampoo shelf.
- Change the rating of X-rated movies to G-rated, allowing children to purchase them via self-checkout.
- Convert the EPC of a new DVD to one on sale for 5 euros.

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 49
**Fun with the EAS**
- The Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) gate at the entrance checks if you have paid for your DVD via RF-ID.
- To deactivate this security system:
  1. Purchase a cheap tag for 50 cents.
  2. Copy the EPC from a DVD on the shelf.
  3. Transfer it to your own tag.
  4. Stick the tag under the gate.
  5. The gate will go on alert.
  6. A clerk will come to check, and after 5 minutes of continuous alarming, they will switch the EAS gate off.

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 50
**Further Attacks**
- Most supply chain software is written without security in mind, making it vulnerable to exploitation via manipulated data fields in the user data of an RF-ID tag.
- Some registers may reboot instantly after reading an RF-ID tag with a manipulated field.
- Shielding the field with aluminum foil can prevent EAS or RF-ID systems from reading a tag.

#### RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology, and Attacks – p. 51
**For Your Privacy**
- Avoid buying products with a credit card and do not use customer cards.
- If you must use a credit card, add entropy to your customer record.

**Risks for Companies**
- New forms of shoplifting are possible.
- Chaos and attacks are feasible.
- Customers can change the EPC, and no one will detect it when using self-checkout.
- Attacks can also target medical drugs and age-restricted materials.
- Attackers need only a publicly available RF-ID reader/writer.
