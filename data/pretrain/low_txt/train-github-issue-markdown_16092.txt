### Model Description

Hello,

My name is Alexander, and I am writing on behalf of Silero, the company that maintains the silero-models project. We have noticed that our models are being rehosted on your platform at the following links:
- [https://huggingface.co/spaces/pytorch/silero_tts](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pytorch/silero_tts)
- [https://huggingface.co/spaces?search=silero](https://huggingface.co/spaces?search=silero)

We did not explicitly grant Hugging Face, Inc. permission to rehost, relicense, or profit from our work and models. Furthermore, this action disregards our CC BY-NC-SA license.

Please remove any of our models from your website and all related resources immediately.

Best regards,  
Alexander
