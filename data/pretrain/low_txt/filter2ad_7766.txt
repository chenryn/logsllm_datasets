## Abstract
The Second Workshop on Forming an Ecosystem Around Software Transformation (FEAST 2017) is held in conjunction with the 24th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2017) on November 3, 2017, in Dallas, Texas. This workshop aims to facilitate discussions and understanding of critical topics related to software executable transformation, with a focus on improving the security and efficiency of software used in security-critical applications. The scope of the workshop includes topics necessary for fully exploiting the potential of late-stage software customization efforts.

## CCS Concepts
- **Security and Privacy:** Software reverse engineering, Software security engineering
- **Software and Its Engineering:** Software maintenance tools, Software verification and validation

## Keywords
- Software transformation
- Binary code
- Security
- Debloating

## 1. Introduction
Traditional software engineering methodologies primarily aim to enhance programmer productivity but often introduce significant execution inefficiencies as a side effect. Recent research has focused on improving software execution efficiency while preserving source code-level abstractions and object-orientation that enhance programmer productivity.

These efforts aim to mitigate the negative impacts on security and performance by reclaiming execution efficiency, reducing indirection, and performing automatic program de-layering and specialization (de-bloating). Promising results from these initiatives have demonstrated their potential to improve execution efficiency and reduce the attack surface for cyber security threats. Consequently, the community may benefit from investing in the development of tool ecosystems to leverage this progress, mature the technologies, and determine the best methods for transparent deployment.

## 2. Topics
The FEAST workshop will provide a platform for researchers to share ideas and developments in software transformation. Key topics include:

- **Understanding Issues:** Challenges in software executable transformation for various programming languages and environments, and potential methods to address these issues.
- **Tool Identification:** Tools needed for ensuring correctness, enhancing security, and enabling the removal of non-critical or undesired features.
- **Suitable Layers and Areas:** Identifying computing system layers and areas that can benefit from software customization/transformation, along with associated challenges and constraints, and the specific adaptations required.
- **Model Extraction:** Automated extraction of models from software executables that are amenable to formal methods analysis and verification.

## 3. Format
Submissions should be in a two-column, 10-point format, with a maximum length of 6 pages, plus additional pages for references as necessary.

## 4. Review Process
All accepted papers underwent double-blind reviews by two to three reviewers. We extend our gratitude to all Program Committee members and external reviewers for their contributions.

## 5. Invited Speakers
The workshop features an invited talk by Vikram S. Adve from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
