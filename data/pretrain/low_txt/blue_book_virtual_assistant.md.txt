A [virtual assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant) is a software agent designed to perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions. Among the open-source solutions, I have found [Kalliope](https://kalliope-project.github.io/) to be the most appealing. I also explored [Mycroft](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core), but it appears to be less focused on self-hosted solutions, although it is possible to do so. Mycroft, however, has a larger community behind it.

For interaction, I plan to start with the [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kalliope.project). Eventually, I intend to install a Raspberry Pi Zero equipped with [Pirate Audio](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/pirate-audio) and an [Akaso external microphone](https://www.akasotech.com/externalmic) in the kitchen to streamline [Grocy](grocy_management.md) inventory management.

## Speech-to-Text (STT) Solutions

Currently, the only self-hosted STT solution available for Kalliope is [CMUSphinx](https://kalliope-project.github.io/kalliope/settings/stt/CMUSphinx/), which is based on [pocketsphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx) and has 2.8k stars. However, its last update was on March 28, 2020.

The CMUSphinx documentation recommends using [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/), which is based on [vosk-api](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api). Vosk has 1.2k stars and was last updated just two days ago. There is an [open issue](https://github.com/kalliope-project/kalliope/issues/606) to support Vosk in Kalliope, with a [French proposal](https://github.com/veka-server/kalliope-vosk) already in place.

This led me to another [issue regarding DeepSpeech support](https://github.com/kalliope-project/kalliope/issues/513). [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) is Mozilla's STT solution, boasting 16.5k stars and being updated three days ago. In my opinion, if the existing solutions fail, DeepSpeech would be the best option. Currently, there is no support for DeepSpeech in Kalliope, but [this repository](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech-examples/blob/r0.9/mic_vad_streaming/) could serve as a starting point.

For Spanish, based on [a Mozilla Discourse thread](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/links-to-pretrained-models/62688), I discovered [DeepSpeech-Polyglot](https://gitlab.com/Jaco-Assistant/deepspeech-polyglot). This project has utilized various datasets, including [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets), to generate [models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-3UgQBtzEf8QcH2qc8TJHkUqCBp5BBmO?usp=sharing).

This structured approach should help in setting up a robust and versatile virtual assistant system.
