### What is the Smart Grid?
- **Current Infrastructure**: Overview of the existing power grid.
- **Future Infrastructure**: Vision for the next-generation smart grid.

### Components of the Smart Grid
- **Devices**: Smart meters, sensors, and other connected devices.
- **Network Infrastructure**: Communication networks and data management systems.
- **Bi-directional Communication**: Real-time data exchange between utilities and consumers.

### Known Problems and Security Challenges
- **Physical Security**: Protecting physical assets from theft and damage.
- **Bi-directional Communication Introduces Attack Vectors**: New vulnerabilities due to real-time data exchange.
- **Common Network Security Issues**: Similar to those found in other types of networks.

### Implications of Security Breaches
- **Google Maps Art**: Visual representation of security breaches.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks**: Disruption of services.
- **Electricity Theft**: Unauthorized consumption of electricity.

### Security Initiatives
- **The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007**: Legislation promoting energy efficiency and security.
- **NIST Interoperability Framework**: Standards for smart grid interoperability.
- **Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) System Security Requirements v1.01**: Guidelines for securing AMI systems.
- **Critical Electric Infrastructure Protection Act (CEIPA) (HR 2195)**: Legislative measures for protecting critical electric infrastructure.

### Timeline of Security Integration
- **Part 1: 2007 - 2009**
  - **Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007**: Key legislation.
  - **NIST Smart Grid Interoperability Framework**: Development of standards.
  - **Initial List of Standards for Inclusion in Version 1.0 (May 8, 2009)**: Release of initial standards.
  - **AMI System Security Requirements v1.01 (2007 - 2008)**: Early guidelines.
  - **CEIPA (HR 2195) (2009)**: Additional legislative support.
- **Part 2: Design and Implementation of the Smart Grid**
  - **Austin (2002)**: Early smart grid project.
  - **Salt River Project (2006)**: Another early implementation.

### Historical Context and Lessons Learned
- **PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard as a reference.
- **"Self-policing" and SAQs**: Self-assessment and reporting mechanisms.
- **NERC and FERC**: Regulatory bodies.
  - **Underreporting by Utilities**: Challenges in accurate reporting.
  - **Aurora Vulnerability**: Specific security threat.

### Recommendations
- **Addressing Missed Opportunities**: Learning from past mistakes.
- **Allowing Security to Mature**: Continuous improvement in security practices.
- **Implementing More Stringent Security Requirements**: Enhancing security measures.
- **Differentiating Between Compliance and Security**: Ensuring true security, not just compliance.
- **Tighter Regulation**: Strengthening regulatory frameworks.
