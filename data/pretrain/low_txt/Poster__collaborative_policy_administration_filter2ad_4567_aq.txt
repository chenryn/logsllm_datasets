### Social Capital, Historical Heritage, Traditional Craftsmanship, and Accessible Advanced Technology

The integration of social capital, historical heritage, traditional craftsmanship, and accessible advanced technology is aimed at achieving socially recognized goals in innovative ways. This type of innovation is driven by social demands rather than market or scientific and technological possibilities. In other words, the innovation is pursued because it is socially desirable, not merely because it is feasible. Typically, this form of social innovation is generated more by the actors involved than by specialists. For product designers, this may require a reorientation of focus, addressing both systems and objects in the design process. Systems thinking is an essential part of sustainability education, as it helps people understand the complexity of the world around them and encourages them to think in terms of relationships, connectedness, and context.

### Emerging Sustainable Ways of Living

Over the past decade, social innovation has spread globally, with various social actors (institutions, enterprises, non-profit organizations, and networks of collaborative individuals) moving beyond conventional models of thinking. These actors are generating a variety of promising initiatives, such as community-supported agriculture, co-housing, car-pooling, community gardens, neighborhood care, talent exchanges, and time banks. Examples of these initiatives can be found in case studies discussed in the book "What’s Mine is Yours" and on the DESIS website (http://www.desis-network.org/). Additionally, the special edition of Co Design (2011) Journal, edited by Lorraine Gamman and Adam Thorpe, provides further case studies. These initiatives offer viable solutions to complex contemporary problems, such as social cohesion, urban regeneration, access to healthy food, water management, and sustainable energy.

Some of your projects may involve encouraging the use of shared assets or promoting collaborations that create new products, services, environments, and experiences that foster sharing. There are numerous examples of such approaches in design. For instance, commercial service designs like StreetCar (now merged with Zipcar, http://www.zipcar.com/) and Zimride (http://public.zimride.com/) aim to reduce carbon emissions by promoting car-sharing. Architectural projects, such as those listed by RIBA, focus on longevity and deliver buildings that can withstand chronic use. Services like Neighborgoods (http://www.neighborgoods.net/) leverage technology to enable efficient and effective sharing of tangible products, spaces, and services in real-time within communities.

### Benefits of Sharing

Sharing among many people of the same product, space, or environment leads to long-term reductions in production and waste. Additionally, sharing is more cost-effective than buying something for a single use or occasion. In urban areas, where neighbors are plentiful and storage space is scarce, sharing is increasingly attractive. Such ideas can inform your project for Camden, but you will need to consult with the community to ensure the viability of your ideas. Many design agencies, such as IDEO, Participle, Think Public, Engine, the Helen Hamlyn Centre, Socially Responsive Design and Innovation Hub, Design Against Crime Research Centre, the Design Council, and Livework, are now engaged in delivering these types of design services. They co-design their ideas with the community and lead the generation of design-led social responses, providing new models of design that enable more sustainable ways of living, including collaborative consumption.

### Design for Social Innovation

Today, social innovation is generating a constellation of small, often design-led initiatives aimed at making the world a better and more sustainable place. If favorable conditions are created, these local social inventions and their working prototypes can spread, scale up, consolidate, replicate, and integrate with larger programs to generate large-scale sustainable changes. To achieve this, new design competencies are needed. Social innovation processes require visions, strategies, and co-design tools and approaches to move from ideas to mature solutions and viable programs. These new design capabilities, collectively, can be defined as design for social innovation.

### Public and Collaborative Services

A global trend is emerging: more people are choosing to behave actively and collaboratively, driven by social and economic factors and enabled by new technologies that facilitate higher levels of connectivity. In this new context, people can establish direct links between interested peers, opening new opportunities for meaningful activism and effective collaboration. Given this new social and technological environment, and the growing challenges people face in their everyday lives, new solutions are being invented and enhanced. Traditionally, individual end-users are becoming collaborative co-producers of the services and organizations that facilitate their daily lives. In these scenarios, the services generated by social innovations are co-designed and co-delivered with the involvement of the final users, leveraging their knowledge, creativity, time, energy, and expertise.

When these everyday life (or 'bottom-up') social innovations appear, they are often fragile and highly localized. To be sustainable and to spread, their value must be recognized and supported. A new generation of public services is needed to support local, collaboratively produced and delivered innovations, making them more effective and promoting their diffusion in other contexts.

### The Client

The Design Against Crime Research Centre (DACRC) and its Socially Responsive Design and Innovation hub (SRvDI) are working with Camden Council and student groups to develop ideas with residents and community groups to co-design sustainable change. Camden’s Green Camden campaign is already moving in the right direction, and our job is to use design to make such initiatives more effective and easier for residents to take green action linked to social innovation. As part of its Green Camden program, the Council has created and delivered several engagement streams, including a user-friendly website, a green directory of local businesses, a green map of resources and services, face-to-face workshops and stalls, a free phone helpline, and a Green Camden Zones program.

The client team includes Adam Thorpe (project lead), Professor Lorraine Gamman (SRvDI @ CSM), Anna Ware, Ines Carvalho, and Katy Mann (Green Camden).

### Brief

The program has five overarching aims:
- Reduce carbon emissions
- Adapt to a changing climate
- Reduce, reuse, and recycle, perhaps linked to collaborative/shared assets
- Improve air quality
- Improve biodiversity

The Council has identified 27 actions with 73 sub-actions that people can take to help achieve these aims. The Green Camden Zones program encourages residents to engage with their neighbors to take these actions collectively. Each zone focuses on at least one of the 27 actions (such as cycling or food growing) and creates an action plan to achieve their goals. Your task is to think about how, after consulting with residents, you can help us and them make effective change happen through co-design.

### Stages of the Project

**Stage 1: Sustainable Actions and Promising Cases (8th February - Green Week Events and Briefing)**
- Introduction to the project by tutors on 30th January.
- Attendance at the briefing on 8th February at 1.15 PM and Jonathan Chapman’s lecture in the afternoon.
- Familiarization with Green Camden’s sustainable actions during the early weeks.
- Listening to presentations introducing the ideas, approaches, processes, and methods proven effective in collaborative design of social innovations.
- Formation of student groups, selection of a set of actions, and research of precedent case studies.
- Creation of a first research presentation to communicate meaningful case studies and begin to collate an 'innovations pool'.

**Stage 2: Community Engagement and Collaborative Research (14th February, 21st February, and 20th February)**
- Matching each student group with one of the Camden Green Zones.
- Working with residents and community groups to explore the diverse demography of residents and their 'assets' and 'needs' related to sustainable objectives.

**Stage 3: Co-Design of Collaborative Innovations and Services (17th April - 30th April)**
- Using collected case studies and initial design concepts as a starting point for discussion.
- Delivering co-design workshops with Green Zone resident groups to explore ways design can facilitate the achievement of existing and newly identified actions and objectives.
- Visualizing the results of these workshops and iteratively co-developing proposals for innovations and services that residents consider viable and desirable.

**Stage 4: Public Service Facilitation and Integration (2nd May - 14th May)**
- Presenting final proposals to Camden Council and project partners to explore how the Council might enable and support the residents' active and collaborative proposals.

### Method

Many design agencies use a model of the design process to structure their activities. We recommend using an adapted version of the Design Council’s Double Diamond model (http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/designprocess) to structure your thinking. The stages include:

**Diagnose:**
- Familiarization and investigation of geographic and demographic study areas (Green Camden Zones) and high and low carbon behaviors (Green Camden actions).

**Discover:**
- 'Discovery mapping' of the geographic study area(s):
  - Journey/scenario mapping (activities of daily living)
  - Stakeholder mapping
  - Agenda/driver mapping
  - Resource mapping
- Learning about the needs and aspirations of Green Zone residents by studying their background, interests, and routines, and charting their activities of daily living.
- Visualizing insights to aid communication and understanding between diverse stakeholders and to locate specific opportunities for design intervention or further exploration.

**Define:**
- User-centered design research methods:
  - Observation
  - Shadowing
  - Design probes/video diaries
- Reviewing the findings of the discover phase to define the sustainable behaviors to be focused on and design of the co-design workshops to follow.
- Creating 'personas' that define the diverse demography and characteristics of the residents and visualizing user-centered research findings for the co-design workshop activities.

**Develop:**
- Student design teams, assisted by the SRvDI Hub team and BAPD tutors, will work with resident groups to deliver workshops to co-design proposals for innovations and services.
- Co-designed prototypes developed by student groups (Iteration 1).
- Feedback workshop 1: Developed proposals will be presented back to the residents for review and further collaborative development.
- Co-designed prototypes developed by student groups (Iteration 2).
- Feedback workshop 2: Co-designed proposals 'signed off' with resident groups.

**Deliver:**
- Student and resident group representatives will present the outcomes of their collaboration to Camden Council and other partners and stakeholders.

### Learning Outcomes and Course Submission

- On 15th May, you will give a formal visual presentation to the course team.
- You will show materials from up to four A3 boards (maximum 4) or digital material no longer than 5 minutes in running time, showing design development and final designs.
- You will produce a short, typewritten text not exceeding 200-300 words (one page) and set in 12pt type, describing your solution, the process by which you reached it, and the benefits you believe it will create. This may be used as your show board or a catalog entry if DACRC/SRvDI creates one.
- Any models or mock-ups in addition to your boards will be looked at or can be presented in Photoshop.
- We will also look briefly at any sketchbook or other material you submit illustrating the development of your solution in response to the brief, if you want us to. All work should be referenced for relevance in your final presentation and in the short typewritten write-up of the project if you want it assessed.

### Time-Scale

The project will run from 8th February to 15th May, when final presentations are made. After that, material will be prepared for your Summer Degree Show.

#### 1. Participatory Design for Social and Public Innovation: Living Labs as Spaces of Agonistic Experiments and Friendly Hacking
**Per-Anders Hillgren**

**Abstract:**
This article presents reflections on the role of a design school in running a DESIS lab that addresses urgent societal challenges. It introduces the intersection between social innovation, participatory design, and living labs. Four examples of agonistic small-scale experiments are provided, where we not only explore potential solutions but also raise questions and dilemmas, allowing controversies to coexist. Finally, four sets of reflections are offered, discussing the implications of conducting agonistic experiments and how we have tried to build alliances with other research disciplines and civil servants to perform 'friendly hacking,' pushing the boundaries of the lab and expanding the potential impact of our activities.

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Agonistic Public Participatory Design
Our background is in participatory design (PD), which emphasizes democracy and the idea that those affected by a design should have a say in the design process. PD has long been concerned with power relations, paying attention to 'weaker' voices and social exclusion. Recently, PD has shifted from a focus on workplace controversies related to information technology to engaging in public spheres and everyday life, where design activities are heterogeneous, partly open, and involve users and stakeholders across organizational and community borders. Inspired by the pragmatic philosopher Dewey, we emphasize the plural form of 'publics' emerging around issues. We acknowledge the need to test new design solutions in real-world contexts, integrating heterogeneous elements such as people, practices, processes, and artifacts. Prototyping is a well-established practice in design and social innovation, often used to test possible solutions. However, prototyping can also raise questions, controversies, and dilemmas. Inspired by Chantal Mouffe, we use the term 'agonism' to describe a political process that allows controversies to exist side by side, respecting each other despite their opposition, united by passionate engagement.
