## Abstract
This study develops a method for collecting security logs from industrial control systems (ICS) as a preliminary step towards ICS security log management and integrated monitoring. While traditional IT technology can be used to collect security logs, it is challenging for specialized ICS devices such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs). PLCs are often targeted by advanced persistent threats (APTs) because they can cause physical damage by directly interacting with sensors or actuators. According to NIST SP 800-92, managing security logs from PLCs is essential for enhancing ICS security. This study analyzes how to collect various types of information from PLCs and describes the results of an experiment that collected system logs from a PLC via its web interface.

## 1. Introduction
Advanced persistent threats (APTs) targeting industrial control systems (ICS) have been increasing. ICS, which integrates physical and virtual environments, has a broad attack surface due to the variety of devices. APT attacks on ICS can lead to national disasters and personal accidents. Single security appliances and technologies like IDS/IPS and firewalls are limited in mitigating these threats. Integrated log management is necessary to detect and respond to continuous APT attacks.

ICS consists of a hierarchical structure, with different types of devices and communication protocols at each level. APTs target the entire ICS, making it essential to examine the characteristics of nodes at each layer and the collectible logs. Comprehensive analysis of these logs can help operators design strategies to respond to APTs and mitigate them at the right time.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) emphasizes the importance of managing security logs to address malicious activities. These logs include those generated by security appliances, software, and system events. We are developing a system to collect security logs from Level 0 to Level 3 and detect ICS attacks through correlation analysis. For Levels 3 and 2, existing IT security technologies can be used. For Level 1, legacy devices pose challenges, and vendor-specific solutions are often required. Recently, many PLCs provide web interfaces, enabling the collection of security logs regardless of the vendor.

## 2. Analysis of PLC Security Log Collection
Figure 3 shows the collection points for security logs in a generic PLC. The PLC includes a CPU module, I/O modules, and a communication module. Security logs can be collected from each of these modules.

### 2.1 OPC-Based Collection
One method involves collecting security logs transferred to the OPC through the CM module. This method is relatively simple but does not collect data directly from the PLC, making it vulnerable to manipulation.

### 2.2 I/O Module Collection
Data can be collected from the communication between the I/O module and sensors/actuators using commercial solutions like Blackbox. However, this method is costly and may introduce latency.

### 2.3 CPU Module Collection
Recent PLCs generate system logs directly from the CPU module. Some PLCs have a built-in web server, allowing remote status checks. Software development is needed to collect this information.

## 3. Collecting PLC Security Logs Using Web Interface
This section describes an experiment to collect security logs from PLCs via their web interfaces. We targeted Siemens S7-1500 and developed a customizable security log collection method. The implemented software can be found at: [GitHub Link].

### 3.1 Identifying Collectable PLC Security Logs
Figure 4 shows the result of checking the PLC log by connecting to the web server in Siemens S7-1500. The information includes system events, CPU usage, and memory usage.

### 3.2 PLC Security Log Collection Results
Figure 5 illustrates log generation trends over five months. Our experiments confirmed that polling every second does not affect PLC operation. During a cyberattack, a large number of security logs were collected for analysis.

## 4. Conclusion
This study identified and analyzed various nodes for collecting security logs in an ICS environment. We collected security logs from an experimental setup with a real PLC providing a web interface. This method can be applied to PLCs from different manufacturers. To ensure safe use, PLC vendors should improve web interface security. This approach will be useful for future integrated monitoring systems.
