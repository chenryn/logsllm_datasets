### Intel 8051 Family Integrated Circuit
The Intel 8051 family integrated circuit is employed to evaluate signals from the remote station and to control all instrument link functions, with the exception of those associated with the one-second timer, the auto-transmit counter, and related components.

### Electronically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM)
The EEPROM interfaces with the microcontroller via a serial interface and provides 1 kilobit (Kbit) of non-volatile storage. This memory is used to store configuration parameters and data that must be retained even when the microcontroller is powered down, such as during the instrument link sleep mode. For instance, the EEPROM stores diagnostic data related to the performance of the instrument link and the remote station. A suitable EEPROM for this application could be the Thompson 93C46 or an equivalent model.

### Interrogation Signal and Message
An interrogation signal preamble is followed by an interrogation message, which is preferably Manchester encoded at a data rate of 1 kbit per second. The message includes various parameters such as:
- Interrogation mode (blind or geographic)
- Instrument link ID (with possible wildcards)
- Reply window length
- Reply RF channel
- Pseudorandom code for spread spectrum modulation
- Reading cycle number
- Data to be transmitted (e.g., register reading or diagnostic information)

To protect against transmission bit errors, the message typically includes a 16-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) field.

### 900 MHz Frequency
- **Usage:** 900 MHz is most commonly used for water meters in the USA.
- **Neptune Meter Specifications:**
  - **Transmit Period:** Every 14 seconds
  - **Transmitter Channels:** 50
  - **Channel Frequency:** 910-920 MHz
  - **FCC Part 15.247 (802.15.247)**
  - **Security:** No encryption, FHSS

### Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)
- **Layer One Method:** FHSS is a Layer One method of transmission.
- **Security Misconception:** Some believe that FHSS enhances security, but this is not accurate. The hopping codes are standardized and publicly available, making it an unreliable security measure.
- **Research Findings:** While FHSS can be an obstacle to eavesdropping, it has been shown that it can be cracked and should not be considered a robust security feature.

### Motivations for Hacking Water Meters
1. Reduce water bills
2. Steal water
3. Evade water restrictions
4. Surveillance
5. Increase others' water bills
6. Introduce malware into water SCADA systems
7. Gain access to other smart grid networks (e.g., electric grid)
8. Reconnaissance for potential attacks

### Evil Consumer
- **Theft of Services:** Consumers may build and distribute Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) devices to lower reported usage and reduce water bills, effectively stealing water and money.
- **Impact:** Reduced revenue for water utilities, leading to less maintenance and higher rates.

### Evil Insider
- **Insider Threat:** Individuals with inside knowledge or access can exploit vulnerabilities in the system to cause harm.
- **Example:** The Maroochie incident in 2000, where a disgruntled former contractor used inside information to release 800,000 liters of sewage into the environment via wireless network communications.

### Terrorist Attack
- **Reconnaissance:** Sending a worm to intercept signals and build a hydraulic map of the system for optimal results when injecting poison.
- **Disruption:** Shutting off water on a specific date and time, coinciding with other attacks, and updating firmware to keep the water off until the utility can update all devices.

### Smart Grid Vulnerability
- **Demonstrated Attacks:** Researchers have demonstrated successful worm attacks on wireless sensor networks, indicating that water smart grids could be equally vulnerable.

### Privacy Concerns
- **Big Brother Scenario:** There are concerns about the amount of personal data that utilities can collect, such as shower times and water usage patterns, raising privacy issues.

### Are We Being Paranoid?
- **Discussion:** It is important to balance the benefits of smart water meters with the potential risks and vulnerabilities.

### Hydrosense
- **Overview:** Hydrosense is a simple, single-point sensor that measures water pressure in a building, providing accurate information about water fixture usage.
- **Features:**
  - Easy installation without a plumber
  - Battery-powered or self-powered using WATTR
  - Measures pressure changes to estimate flow rate using Poiseuille’s Law
  - Sends data wirelessly to the water utility

### Vulnerabilities of Wireless Water Meters
- **Design Flaws:** Low onboard memory, lack of FHSS or encryption, and easily accessible transceivers.
- **Improvements:** More vendors are now incorporating encryption, such as AES 128-bit and 256-bit encryption.

### Design Advances in Water Meters
- **Third Generation Meters:** These meters do not require batteries and offer 99.9% accuracy.

### Ongoing Work
- **Tools and Kits:** Various development kits and software-defined radios are being tested to replicate and improve upon existing FHSS cracking techniques.
- **Future Plans:** Reverse engineering wireless water meters and experimenting with different tools and methodologies.

### Conclusion
- **Importance:** Water meters are critical components of the national drinking water infrastructure.
- **Financial and Security Impacts:** Tampering with water meters can result in financial losses and security vulnerabilities.
- **Recommendations:** Enhanced security measures, including encryption and robust design, are necessary to protect water systems.
