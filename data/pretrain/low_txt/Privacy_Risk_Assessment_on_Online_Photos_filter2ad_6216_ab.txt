### Metadata Fields in Photos

Photos typically contain embedded metadata fields, but often a significant portion of this information is missing. Our analysis indicates that two specific metadata fields, camera make and model, are the most fundamental. If these fields are absent, it is likely that other metadata fields are also missing. Therefore, we use the presence of either the camera make or model to determine if a photo contains metadata. A photo is considered to have metadata if at least one of these fields has a non-empty value.

### Prevalence of Metadata in Fresh Photos

Using a third-party library [2], we examined 612 "fresh" photos for the prevalence of metadata. We also checked for sensitive metadata fields such as geolocation, owner's information, and modification history, as discussed in Section 2. Figure 1 illustrates the percentages of photos containing metadata and sensitive metadata fields.

- **86.4%** of "fresh" photos contain metadata, highlighting the widespread presence of metadata in newly taken digital photos.
- **15%** of fresh photos include geolocation information, indicating that while most smartphones are GPS-equipped, not all users enable this feature. This percentage could decrease if more users become aware of the automatic embedding of geolocation data and choose to disable it.
- Virtually no "fresh" photos contain photographers' information or modification history, which we attribute to our strict task requirements and the fact that these fields may not be automatically embedded at the time of capture.

### Impact of Smartphone OS on Geolocation Metadata

We also investigated how different smartphone operating systems (OS) handle geolocation metadata. As shown in Figure 2, approximately one-third of iOS and Windows phones automatically embed geolocation into photos, whereas only about 10% of Android and BlackBerry phones do so.

### Intact Photos

In the "intact" stage, photos are posted online with their original metadata intact. This allows us to assess the status of metadata in digital photos at the time of sharing. In this section, we describe our data collection method and examine the metadata in these "intact" photos.

#### Data Collection

To gather these photos, we used Flickr's API to download photos in their original size, ensuring they remain unaltered. We collected two sets of "intact" photos:

- **Flickr p**: 18,404 photos taken exclusively with smartphones, sourced from the Flickr group "Smartphone Photography."
- **Flickr 6**: 43,704 photos uploaded between July 1, 2014, and December 31, 2014, of which 94.3% were taken with digital cameras.

#### Metadata Information Embedded

We analyzed the metadata in these "intact" photos, focusing on sensitive fields. The results, shown in Figure 3, indicate:

- **76.4%** of Flickr p and **94.1%** of Flickr 6 photos contain metadata.
- **37.1%** of Flickr p and **27.2%** of Flickr 6 photos include GPS information, suggesting some users may add this data during post-processing.
- **65.6%** of Flickr p and **88.1%** of Flickr 6 photos contain photographer information, posing a risk of identity leakage.
- About half of Flickr 6 photos include modification history, reflecting the use of image processing software by owners of professional digital cameras.

### Wild Photos

In the "wild" stage, photos have been online for some time and may have undergone multiple modifications. We aimed to determine the remaining metadata and explore how top media sites handle hosted photos.

#### Data Collection

We used two methods to collect "wild" photos:

1. **Google Images Search**: Collected 38,140 photos (denoted as GoogleImage) using specific search parameters.
2. **Top Media Sites**: Selected 700 unique top-ranked sites from seven categories (social networking, weblog, news, college, government, classified, and shopping). After filtering, we obtained 97,403 photos from 611 unique sites (denoted as TopSitesPhoto).

#### Metadata Information Embedded

Figure 5 shows the metadata in "wild" photos:

- **41.5%** of GoogleImage and **40.4%** of TopSitesPhoto photos contain metadata.
- Very few "wild" photos (0.6% of GoogleImage and 1.8% of TopSitesPhoto) include GPS coordinates.
- **13.2%** of GoogleImage and **8.7%** of TopSitesPhoto photos contain photographer identification.
- **25.4%** of GoogleImage and **14.1%** of TopSitesPhoto photos include modification history.

These results suggest that a significant proportion of "wild" photos have had their metadata stripped away.

### Inferring Online Sites' Photo Handling Policies

Based on the TopSitesPhoto dataset, we analyzed each site's photo handling policies, focusing on whether they resize photos and remove metadata. 

- **Resizing**: We determined if a site resizes its hosted photos.
- **Metadata Removal**: We assessed if a site removes embedded metadata from photos.

This analysis provides insights into the practices of various online platforms regarding the handling of digital photos.
