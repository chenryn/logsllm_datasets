**Recommendations:**
- Proactively recruit new participants, including regional, state, and federal agencies (e.g., FBI, BLM), and define roles and responsibilities for all governance group members.
- Review the strategic plan annually.
- Align regional and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met.

### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation
- **Existing SOPs:** Ada County has well-established SOPs for interoperability, which have been disseminated to participating agencies.
- **TICP Validation:** During the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) validation exercise, some regional SOPs were not followed, highlighting the need for further dissemination and training.
- **NIMS/ICS Implementation:** NIMS/ICS was implemented over a year ago, and the performance of the acting Communications Unit Leader during the exercise was noted as "noteworthy."

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure all participating agencies review and understand SOPs (e.g., gateway SOPs).
- Ensure that SOPs are consistent with regional and statewide interoperability communications plans.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

### Usage: Established Implementation
- **Daily Use:** Ada County reports daily use of shared channels, gateways, and the countyâ€™s shared system.
- **TICP Validation Exercise:** All available interoperability methods were successfully demonstrated during the TICP validation exercise. The limited scope of the exercise did not require extensive cross-jurisdictional communication, but the Boise Bomb Squad effectively communicated when needed.
- **User Proficiency:** Dispatchers appeared somewhat unfamiliar with identifying and manipulating existing patches, but the patch was used successfully to connect multiple agencies.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional communications interoperability resources to improve user proficiency.
- Consider adding interagency/multijurisdictional communications interoperability (including federal agencies) as a component for all future exercises.

### Technology Overview
- **Current Systems:** Ada County communications are fragmented between VHF and UHF bands. Law enforcement agencies primarily use UHF, while fire and emergency medical services use VHF.
- **Transition:** Ada County is transitioning to a new 700 MHz digital P25-compliant trunked system, scheduled to be complete by the end of the first quarter of 2007.
- **Statewide Plan:** The Idaho Statewide Interoperability Executive Council released a plan in July 2005, focusing on a 700 MHz statewide P25-compliant backbone. Cost issues may lead to an integrated P25 solution using 700 MHz in populated areas and a combination of UHF and VHF in rural areas.
