### Idaho: Ada County Metropolitan Area

**Designation:**
Ada County, Idaho, has been designated as the metropolitan area, encompassing unincorporated parts of Ada County, the cities of Boise, Eagle, Garden City, Kuna, Meridian, and Star, as well as the Boise Air Terminal.

**Governance: Advanced Implementation**
- **Interoperability Priority:** Ada County places a high priority on communications interoperability, as evidenced by the broad membership in the Ada County (Idaho) Emergency Communications Planning Committee (ECPC). This committee includes representatives from various agencies, such as Idaho State Communications.
- **System Transition:** The county is currently transitioning to a new system, with regular updates to agreements among all agencies to facilitate this change.
- **Strategic Plan:** A strategic plan for interoperability is in place, covering fire, public works, and hazardous materials agencies. Local organizations consider multi-agency interoperability when procuring communications equipment.
- **Funding:** Dedicated local funding, such as the 9-1-1 tax, supports new technology, upgrades, and maintenance, reducing reliance on federal grants.
- **Leadership Support:** The Ada County Sheriff, along with the governor, provides political and fiscal support for communications interoperability across the area.

**Recommendations:**
- Proactively recruit new participants, including regional, state, and federal agencies (e.g., FBI, BLM), and define roles and responsibilities for all governance group members.
- Review the strategic plan annually.
- Align regional and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met.

### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation
- **Existing SOPs:** Ada County has well-established SOPs for interoperability, which have been disseminated to participating agencies.
- **TICP Validation:** During the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) validation exercise, some regional SOPs were not followed, highlighting the need for further dissemination and training.
- **NIMS/ICS Implementation:** NIMS/ICS was implemented over a year ago, and the performance of the acting Communications Unit Leader during the exercise was noted as "noteworthy."

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure all participating agencies review and understand SOPs (e.g., gateway SOPs).
- Ensure that SOPs are consistent with regional and statewide interoperability communications plans.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

### Usage: Established Implementation
- **Daily Use:** Ada County reports daily use of shared channels, gateways, and the county’s shared system.
- **TICP Validation Exercise:** All available interoperability methods were successfully demonstrated during the TICP validation exercise. The limited scope of the exercise did not require extensive cross-jurisdictional communication, but the Boise Bomb Squad effectively communicated when needed.
- **User Proficiency:** Dispatchers appeared somewhat unfamiliar with identifying and manipulating existing patches, but the patch was used successfully to connect multiple agencies.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional communications interoperability resources to improve user proficiency.
- Consider adding interagency/multijurisdictional communications interoperability (including federal agencies) as a component for all future exercises.

### Technology Overview
- **Current Systems:** Ada County communications are fragmented between VHF and UHF bands. Law enforcement agencies primarily use UHF, while fire and emergency medical services use VHF.
- **Transition:** Ada County is transitioning to a new 700 MHz digital P25-compliant trunked system, scheduled to be complete by the end of the first quarter of 2007.
- **Statewide Plan:** The Idaho Statewide Interoperability Executive Council released a plan in July 2005, focusing on a 700 MHz statewide P25-compliant backbone. Cost issues may lead to an integrated P25 solution using 700 MHz in populated areas and a combination of UHF and VHF in rural areas.
