Welcome to my personal [digital garden](digital_garden.md), where I share my learnings and insights on a wide array of topics, including [antifascism](antifascism.md) and other forms of [activism](diversity.md), [life management](life_management.md), [health](sleep.md), [Python](python.md), [DevOps](devops.md), [software architecture](adr.md), [writing](writing.md), [dancing](rave_dances.md), and [data analysis](recommender_systems.md). Unlike traditional blogging, where articles are often written and then forgotten, the content here is treated as living, evolving entities. Some pieces may wither over time, while others will flourish, providing a continuous source of knowledge for both me and the community.

## Visiting the Garden

If this is your first visit, welcome! You might feel overwhelmed by the amount of content. Start by exploring the navigation tree on the left and dive into the first article that catches your interest. Feel free to follow the internal links to explore further. Alternatively, you can use the search bar at the top or clone the [git repository](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book) and use tools like `grep` for more advanced searches.

## Create Your Own Digital Garden

I encourage you to [create your own digital garden](build_your_own_wiki.md) and share your knowledge with the world. If you prefer, you can also [contribute](#contributing) to existing gardens, such as this one. I would be thrilled to see the blue-book maintained and expanded by others.

If you don't want to start from scratch, you can [fork the blue book](forking_this_wiki.md), rename it, and start writing right away. For inspiration, you can view [other similar gardens](digital_garden.md#existing-digital-gardens).

## History

In the past, I tried maintaining traditional blogs, but they didn't suit my style. I found it challenging to set aside time to write full articles about what I had done. Instead, I needed to document my thoughts and learnings in real-time. As I often engage in incremental reading and work on multiple projects simultaneously, I improve several articles at once in an unordered manner. This approach aligns with [Gwern's Long Content principle](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content).

The main drawback of this format is the lack of a user-friendly way for readers to stay updated with changes. To address this, I created [mkdocs-newsletter](https://lyz-code.github.io/mkdocs-newsletter/).

In 2016, I began writing summaries of various concepts, installation guides, and tool usage instructions in text files. Initially, these were in plaintext, then I moved to [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and later [Asciidoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc). Over three years, I wrote 7,422 articles and nearly 50 million lines of content, always with myself as the primary audience.

After discovering [Gwern's website](https://www.gwern.net/) and [Nikita's wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz), I decided to refactor my wiki to give it a semantic structure, making it more readable and accessible to the internet. Thus, the blue book was born.
