### Issue: Missing `anchorPosition` and `anchorReference` Props in Popover TypeScript Definition

**Description:**
The TypeScript definition file for the `Popover` component is missing the `anchorPosition` and `anchorReference` props, which were added in pull request #9004. I believe (though I am not familiar with Flow) that the Flow types for these props are present in the `.js` component file.

**Expected Behavior:**
In TypeScript projects, the `Popover` component should be able to accept `anchorPosition` and `anchorReference` props without causing type errors.

**Current Behavior:**
When using the `Popover` component in a TypeScript project, the following type errors are thrown:
- `TS2339: Property 'anchorPosition' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & PopoverProps & { children?: ReactNode; }'.`
- `TS2339: Property 'anchorReference' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & PopoverProps & { children?: ReactNode; }'`.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Add `anchorPosition` and `anchorReference` to the `Popover` component.
2. Compile the code with TypeScript.

**Environment:**
- **Material-UI:** 1.0.0-beta.22
- **React:** 16.1.1
- **Browser:** N/A
- **TypeScript:** 2.6.1

**Additional Context:**
I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
