### Users' Perspective on Device Locking

Users may be justified in not locking their devices, as the effort required to do so might outweigh the value of the data being protected. For instance, Harbach et al. [21] found that over a 27-day period, participants spent an average of more than an hour just unlocking their devices. This time investment can be significant and may deter users from implementing security measures.

### Contextual Security Practices

Locking one's device is not a one-size-fits-all solution. While many users benefit from this practice, it may not be universally applicable. Instead, systems should be designed to accommodate nuanced security policies, balancing user convenience with risk management.

### 6.4 Limitations

As with any human subjects experiment, our participants were limited to those who were willing to participate. Although the demographics of our online samples were representative of the U.S. Internet-using population, our interview sample lacked highly skilled professionals. None of our interview participants reported storing sensitive work-related documents on their smartphones. This absence may have affected the generalizability of our results. For example, doctors, lawyers, and tech workers might store more sensitive information on their devices and might take additional precautions to protect it. However, we believe that any bias here is limited, as highly skilled professionals make up a small proportion of the total population.

Similarly, few of our interview participants were parents. We suspect that parents would likely have photographs or other sensitive information about their children on their devices, which could increase their concern about unauthorized access to a stolen smartphone.

Our interviews and online survey relied on self-reported data. The email search task was self-reported because we could not ethically inspect the email accounts of others to measure the prevalence of sensitive information. We designed the experiment to provide the same incentive regardless of the outcome, leading us to believe that any bias would favor under-reporting. Therefore, the numbers we report on risks are likely lower bounds.

### 6.5 Conclusions

We examined the reasons why smartphone users choose or choose not to use a security lock on their phones. We followed this study with an online survey to generalize our findings to the larger U.S. population. We observed that all participants used their devices to check their email accounts, regardless of whether they chose to lock their devices. Consequently, we conducted another online experiment to quantify the frequency with which sensitive information could be obtained via an email account. Based on these experiments, we offered design suggestions to help platforms increase the number of users who use a security lock on their smartphones and to better communicate these risks to end users. However, further research is needed to validate these suggestions.

### Appendix A: Recruitment Advertisement

To recruit our 28 interview participants, we posted the following advertisement to the Craigslist Bay Area “et cetera jobs” forum:

**Subject: Smartphone owners - participate in a study!**

Do you own a smartphone?
Have you been using it for at least 6 months?

If you answered "yes" to both questions, you may be eligible to participate in a study that looks at how people use smartphones!

The study involves meeting a UC Berkeley researcher for an interview in a public place (e.g., a Starbucks near the Berkeley BART). During the interview, you will answer questions about the apps you have installed on your phone, the activities you typically use your phone for, and how you use various features on your phone.

The interview will take less than an hour. Participants will receive a $35 Visa gift card for participating in the study.

To be eligible for this study, you must:
- Be over 18
- Have owned a smartphone for at least 6 months

Please fill out the following survey, and we will contact you if you qualify: [URL to the screening survey on SurveyGizmo]
