**ATT&CK ID:** S0268  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Bisonal

Bisonal variants reported in 2014 and 2015 utilized a simple XOR cipher for command and control (C2) communications. However, some more recent Bisonal samples have been observed to encrypt C2 communications using the RC4 algorithm. [15][16][17]
