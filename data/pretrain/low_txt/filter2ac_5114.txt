**ATT&CK ID:** T1071.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Web Protocols

Adversaries may use application layer protocols associated with web traffic to blend in with legitimate network activity, thereby evading detection and network filtering. In this technique, commands sent to the remote system, as well as the results of those commands, are embedded within the protocol traffic exchanged between the client and server. This method allows malicious actors to conceal their activities by mimicking normal web traffic.
