### Certificate Authentication and Chain Verification

**Authentication Process:**
- **Chain of Trusted Certificates:** The authentication process often involves a chain of trusted certificates.
- **Verification of User Certificate:** The digital signature on a user certificate is verified using the public key from the issuing Certification Authority (CA) certificate.
- **Root CA Verification:** If the CA certificate is a root certificate, the verification process is complete.
- **Intermediate CA Verification:** If the CA certificate was issued by an intermediate CA, the digital signature on the intermediate CA certificate must be verified. This process continues until a root certificate is reached.
- **Complete Chain Verification:** In such cases, all certificates in the chain must be verified correctly.
- **Key Repository Check:** If the key repository on the computer performing the authentication does not contain a valid root certificate for the CA that issued the incoming user certificate, the authentication fails.

**TLS Implementations:**
- **GSKit, DCM, and RACF:** Certain TLS implementations, such as GSKit, DCM, and RACF, validate the certificates as long as the trust anchor (root CA) is present, even if some intermediate CAs are missing from the trust chain.
- **Server-Side Certificate Store:** It is important to ensure that the server-side certificate store contains the complete trust chain.
- **Avoid Selective Removal:** The technique of selectively removing signer (CA) certificates should not be used to control connectivity to the queue manager.

**Information Provided for Each Problem:**
- **Output from SystemOut.log or Console:** Details the cause of the exception.
- **Queue Manager Error Log Information.**
- **Solution to the Problem.**

**Note:**
- Always list out the stacks and the cause of the first exception.
- Whether the error information is written to the stdout log file depends on the application and the framework used.
- Sample code includes stacks and line numbers, which are useful for guidance but may change between fix packs. Use this information to locate the correct section, not for specific diagnostic purposes.

### Common TLS Problems and Solutions

#### Cipher Suite Not Set on Client
- **Output:**
  - `com.ibm.mq.jmqi.JmqiException: CC=2;RC=2397;AMQ9641: Remote CipherSpec error for channel 'SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN' to host ''. [3=SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN]`
- **Queue Manager Error Logs:**
  - `AMQ9639: Remote channel 'SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN' did not specify a CipherSpec.`
- **Solution:**
  - Set a CipherSuite on the client so that both ends of the channel have a matching CipherSuite or CipherSpec pair.

#### Cipher Suite Not Set on Server
- **Output:**
  - `com.ibm.mq.jmqi.JmqiException: CC=2;RC=2397;AMQ9641: Remote CipherSpec error for channel 'SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN' to host ''. [3=SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN]`
- **Queue Manager Error Logs:**
  - `AMQ9639: Remote channel 'SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN' did not specify a CipherSpec.`
- **Solution:**
  - Change the channel `SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN` to specify a valid CipherSpec.

#### Cipher Mismatch
- **Output:**
  - `com.ibm.mq.jmqi.JmqiException: CC=2;RC=2397;AMQ9641: Remote CipherSpec error for channel 'SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN' to host ''. [3=SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN]`
- **Queue Manager Error Logs:**
  - `AMQ9631: The CipherSpec negotiated during the TLS handshake does not match the required CipherSpec for channel 'SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN'.`
- **Solution:**
  - Change either the SSLCIPH definition of the server-connection channel or the Cipher suite of the client so that the two ends have a matching CipherSuite or CipherSpec pair.

#### Missing Client Personal Certificate
- **Output:**
  - `com.ibm.mq.jmqi.JmqiException: CC=2;RC=2059;AMQ9503: Channel negotiation failed. [3=SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN]`
- **Queue Manager Error Logs:**
  - `AMQ9637: Channel is lacking a certificate.`
- **Solution:**
  - Ensure that the key database of the queue manager contains a signed personal certificate from the truststore of the client.

#### Missing Server Personal Certificate
- **Output:**
  - `com.ibm.mq.jmqi.JmqiException: CC=2;RC=2397;AMQ9771: SSL handshake failed. [1=javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException[Remote host closed connection during handshake], 3=localhost/127.0.0.1:1418 (localhost), 4=SSLSocket.startHandshake, 5=default]`
- **Queue Manager Error Logs:**
  - `AMQ9637: Channel is lacking a certificate.`
- **Solution:**
  - Ensure that the key database of the queue manager contains a signed personal certificate from the truststore of the client.

#### Missing Server Signer on Client
- **Output:**
  - `com.ibm.mq.jmqi.JmqiException: CC=2;RC=2397;AMQ9771: SSL handshake failed. [1=javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException[PKIX path validation failed: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: The certificate issued by CN=JohnDoe, O=COMPANY, L=YOURSITE, C=XX is not trusted; internal cause is: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Signature does not match.], 3=localhost/127.0.0.1:1418 (localhost), 4=SSLSocket.startHandshake, 5=default]`
- **Queue Manager Error Logs:**
  - `AMQ9665: SSL connection closed by remote end of channel '????'.`
- **Solution:**
  - Add the certificate used to sign the personal certificate of the queue manager to the truststore of the client.

#### Missing Client Signer on Server
- **Output:**
  - `com.ibm.mq.jmqi.JmqiException: CC=2;RC=2397;AMQ9771: SSL handshake failed. [1=java.net.SocketException[Software caused connection abort: socket write error], 3=localhost/127.0.0.1:1418 (localhost), 4=SSLSocket.startHandshake, 5=default]`

  - `AMQ9633: Bad SSL certificate for channel '????'.`
- **Solution:**
  - Add the certificate used to sign the personal certificate of the client to the key database of the queue manager.

#### SSLPEER Set on Server Does Not Match Certificate
- **Output:**
  - `com.ibm.mq.jmqi.JmqiException: CC=2;RC=2397;AMQ9643: Remote SSL peer name error for channel 'SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN' on host ''. [3=SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN]`
