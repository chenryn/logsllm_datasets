**Abstract**  
Drawing on his experience within one of the world's largest social networks during the 2016 and 2018 elections, and leading an election integrity war room in 2020, the speaker will discuss the ways in which technology often fails to meet the needs of the people it aims to serve. The presentation will explore realistic assumptions about threats and user expectations, and propose a path forward for how cutting-edge security research can better inform engineers and product designers who are responsible for developing technologies used by billions of people.
