# DSN 2007 Tutorials
## Author: Luís E. T. Rodrigues, Universidade de Lisboa

### Message from the Tutorials Chair

Tutorials are a crucial component of the DSN (Dependable Systems and Networks) conference program. They offer attendees the opportunity to gain a foundational understanding of, and familiarity with, several state-of-the-art topics related to the dependability, security, and resilience of systems and networks. Proposals that provide practical guidance on the successful application of technology in real-world systems were especially encouraged.

This year, we received nine tutorial proposals. A two-phase selection process was employed to choose the final five tutorials. In the first phase, all proposals were carefully evaluated by a scientific panel consisting of Anish Arora, Danny Dolev, Shivakant Mishra, Michel Raynal, Neil Speirs, and myself. The panel prepared a recommendation, which was then discussed in the second phase by the DSN steering committee in collaboration with the DSN organizers. The final selection considered various factors, including the relevance of the topic to DSN attendees, the quality of the tutorial structure, the merit and qualifications of the speakers, as well as practical considerations such as logistical constraints.

Thanks to the high quality of the submissions, DSN 2007 is able to offer an excellent set of tutorials on timely and relevant topics. On behalf of the scientific panel, I would like to thank all the authors who submitted proposals, making it possible to assemble such a strong tutorial program. I also extend my gratitude to the members of the scientific panel for their insightful contributions to the selection process. Finally, I would like to thank the DSN 2007 organization, particularly Tom Anderson and Mohamed Kaaniche, for their support provided to our panel.
