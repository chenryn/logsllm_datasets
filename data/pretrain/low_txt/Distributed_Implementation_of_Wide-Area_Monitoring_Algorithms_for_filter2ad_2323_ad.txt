**Figure 8 Analysis:**
Figure 8 illustrates the estimation error per iteration using the proposed algorithm. It is important to note that Figure 8 only compares the estimation results per iteration for the proposed algorithms and does not account for the time required to execute each iteration. Each iteration of H-ADMM involves sequential communication between the hierarchies of PDCs, which increases the actual time for completing one iteration compared to S-ADMM. Similarly, D-ADMM may be slower than S-ADMM per iteration due to its sequential communication, while S-ADMM benefits from parallel communication between PDCs.

**Table II: Inter-Area Eigenvalue Estimation:**
Table II presents the estimates of the four inter-area eigenvalues obtained from the four algorithms and compares them with their actual values and the results of the centralized Prony method. The table shows that all the algorithms provide accurate estimates of the slow eigenvalues, with a relative error of less than 1 percent.

**Comparison with Centralized Prony:**
The drawbacks of these distributed architectures compared to the centralized Prony method are evident. S-ADMM requires both uplink and downlink communications, unlike the centralized Prony. D-ADMM compromises data privacy. H-ADMM incurs higher communication delays but reduces computational load.

**IEEE 145-Bus Model:**
We next consider the IEEE 145-bus model as a larger case study [24]. The system is divided into 8 areas, each containing 1 local PDC and 10 PMUs. The PMU bus identities are listed in Table III. Simulated measurements are obtained using the PST nonlinear dynamics simulation routine `s_simu` and the data file `data50m.m` [23]. A three-phase fault is applied on the line connecting buses 6 and 7, starting at \( t = 0.1 \) seconds, clearing at bus 6 at \( t = 0.15 \) seconds and at bus 7 at \( t = 0.20 \) seconds. The measurements are downsampled, and the initial 10 samples (1 second) are gathered before starting the iterations. We set \( 2n = 120 \) and \( \rho = 10^{-5} \). Figure 9 demonstrates the convergence of the estimates of \( \sigma \) and \( \Omega \) per iteration to the actual values for four selected slow modes of the system after 200 iterations.

**Computation Time:**
The average computation time per iteration per PDC in this case is 4.7 milliseconds. If we reduce the number of PMUs per PDC to 4, increasing the number of PDCs to 20, the average run-time per iteration decreases to 1.9 milliseconds. This highlights the computational efficiency of the proposed distributed algorithms as the network size increases, making it easier to control the ratio of PMUs and PDCs in each area.

**Real-Time Simulations Using ExoGENI:**
In addition to the conventional approach of estimating oscillation modes using offline software like MATLAB, we implemented our distributed algorithms using C/C++ in a realistic US-wide network testbed called ExoGENI [25]. This testbed supports research and innovation in networking, operating systems, future Internet architectures, and networked data-intensive cloud computing. Our Real-time Digital Simulator (RTDS)-based hardware-in-the-loop PMU testbed at NC State has been integrated with ExoGENI, forming a federated testbed called ExoGENI-WAMS. Details about this testbed can be found in [26]. An advantage of using ExoGENI is the ability to run parallel applications with performance isolation. Each application can run in its own virtual infrastructure, consisting of virtual machines (VMs) and storage connected by virtual networking channels. Therefore, the oscillation monitoring algorithms can operate in perfect isolation, even with varying PMU data resolutions without interference.

**End-to-End Delays:**
We used this federated testbed to evaluate the end-to-end delays in implementing the S-ADMM algorithm using real-time data streaming from multiple PMUs to multiple PDCs realized using VMs. ExoGENI allows users to create custom topologies using resources from multiple federated providers via a control and management software called the Open Resource Control Architecture (ORCA). We implemented Architecture 1, where four VMs serve as local PDCs (clients) and the fifth VM serves as the central server. The IEEE 39-bus power system model introduced in [17] is used. The clients accept local PMU data from the RTDS, execute the algorithm, and send the estimates to the server. The server averages the estimates and transmits the average back to the clients for the next step. The component-wise end-to-end delays for each iteration are shown in Table IV. Although S-ADMM has a significantly large delay \( T_3 \), its total end-to-end time is only 22% of that for the centralized Prony, due to much smaller \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) for the distributed case.

**Conclusions:**
In this paper, we presented four cyber-physical estimation algorithms for wide-area oscillation monitoring using Synchrophasors. These algorithms demonstrate how geographically dispersed PMUs and PDCs can communicate and how various binding factors in network protocols can pose bottlenecks. The results provide valuable insights and guidance for deploying future PMU and PDC infrastructures, not only for power systems but also for any generic cyber-physical sensor network where monitoring and control decisions need to be made under critical time constraints. Future work will focus on evaluating the reliability of the proposed architectures under different cyber-attack scenarios.
