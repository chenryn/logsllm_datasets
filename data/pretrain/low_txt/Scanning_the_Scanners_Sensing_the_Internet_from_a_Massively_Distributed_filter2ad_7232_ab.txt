### Table 1: Total Packets Logged in November 2018
- This table summarizes the total number of packets and bytes logged from 89,000 machines in November 2018.

### Token Bucket Sampling
During heavy bursts of unsolicited traffic, such as DDoS attacks on CDN machines, the logging of unsolicited packets is controlled via a token bucket mechanism. Each machine is configured with a local token bucket of capacity 10. Each logged packet consumes one token, and two new tokens are added to the bucket every second until it reaches its maximum capacity of 10. This limits prolonged traffic bursts to 2 packets per second. Sporadic traffic, however, is fully logged without sampling.

### 3.2 Dataset Characteristics
- **Table 1** shows the totals of logged packets and bytes from 89,000 machines in November 2018.
- TCP packets with the SYN flag set make up the majority of logged packets (approximately 98%), while UDP accounts for about 12% of the packets but 40% of the bytes.
- The high percentage of TCP SYN packets indicates that the logged data primarily consists of connection attempts to the servers, rather than backscatter traffic, which would show up with ACK or RST flags.
- Wustrow et al. reported an increase in the percentage of Internet Background Radiation with only the SYN flag set between 2006 and 2010, finding that 94% of TCP traffic had the SYN flag set in 2010 [32].

### Non-burst vs. Burst State
- We assess how often the token buckets are in a burst state, indicating large amounts of unsolicited traffic.
- **Figure 1a** partitions the logging into (machine, 10-second) bins, showing the number of packets each machine logs within each 10-second timeframe.
- In more than 50% of the bins, no unsolicited traffic was logged. In another 22% of bins, one packet was received, and in 10% of bins, two packets were received.
- Only in less than 0.1% of bins did machines log at least 20 packets, indicating a burst state.
- In November 2018, "burst packets" (packets logged by a machine that logged 20 or more packets in a 10-second bin) made up approximately 2.3% of the total dataset.
- In almost 99.9% of the bins, the machine was not in a burst state and logged all unsolicited traffic, providing excellent visibility into sporadic traffic, such as scanning.

### 3.3 Assessing Presence of Filtering
- The CDN servers are hosted in over 1,300 individual networks, and we do not control potential filtering at AS boundaries.
- Port-based filtering at network boundaries is common to prevent exploitation of well-known services.
- **Figure 1c** shows the percentage of ASes where no machine received probing packets, indicating port-based filtering.
- Up to 10% of ASes filter specific ports, such as port 445 (Windows Remote Desktop) and Windows NetBIOS (ports 137, 138, 139).
- Less than 3% of our servers are affected by port filtering, suggesting that disparate deployment of network filtering does not severely affect our inferences of scanning behavior.

### 3.4 Baseline Traffic and Local Concentrations
- **Figure 1b** suggests a consistent distribution of packets over machines.
- Each machine has two publicly routed IPv4 addresses: a client-facing IP and an operations IP.
- **Figure 2** shows the daily traffic on client-facing and operations interfaces for four example machines.
- Most machines show a steady number of packets received on both interfaces, with traffic balanced at approximately 3,000 packets per day and IP address.
- Some machines show traffic spikes, but these spikes are correlated over both IP addresses, indicating CDN-agnostic patterns.
- Other machines show spikes targeting the client-facing IP, indicating CDN-targeted patterns.
- All inspected machines fall into one of three behavioral patterns: baseline radiation, CDN-agnostic, or CDN-targeted traffic.

### 4. Scrutinizing Sources
- We present a source-centric perspective of unsolicited traffic arriving at our telescope.
- **Figure 3a** shows a heatmap of source IP addresses, binned by the number of destination IPs contacted (fan-out) and the total number of packets logged.
- **Figure 3b** partitions source IP addresses by fan-out and packet-to-IP ratio, showing the distribution of unique source IP addresses, total packets, and the share of packets received as part of bursts.
- The vast majority of source IP addresses contact a small number of machines and send a small number of packets, accounting for only 3% of the total packets.
- A small number of source IP addresses (about 0.001%) account for 28% of the overall packets, with most burst packets sent by sources hitting a small number of machines with a large number of packets.

### 4.2 CDN-targeted vs. CDN-agnostic
- We classify the behavior of source IP addresses based on whether they target client-facing IPs, operations IPs, or both.
- **Figure 4** shows the fraction of packets targeting client-facing IPs for each source IP.
- We define a scan as a sequence of probes from a given source address that hit at least n distinct destination IP addresses, with interarrival times of the probes to any address.
