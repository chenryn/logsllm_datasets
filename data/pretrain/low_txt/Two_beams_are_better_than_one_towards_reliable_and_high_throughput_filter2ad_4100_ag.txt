### Optimal Multi-Beam Patterns for SNR and Throughput in General k-Path Channels

In this section, we demonstrate that multi-beam patterns with appropriate power and phase control are optimal for maximizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the receiver. We first construct a maximum likelihood (ML) based solution and then show that the multi-beam approach closely approximates the ML estimate.

#### Optimal Beamforming Weights

The optimal beamforming weights for a general multi-path channel \( h \) are given by:
\[
w_{\text{opt}} = \frac{h^*}{||h||},
\]
which provides the maximum SNR of \( \frac{||h||^2 P_s}{P_\eta} \). Note that these optimal beamforming weights depend on the multi-path channel taps.

#### Geometric Channel Model

We represent the channel using a geometric model [93, 94]:
\[
h(t) = \sum_{\ell=0}^{L-1} a(\phi_\ell) \gamma_\ell e^{j 2\pi f_c \tau_\ell} \delta(t - \tau_\ell),
\]
where the channel is bounded by \( L \) paths, and \( \phi_\ell, \gamma_\ell, \tau_\ell \) represent the Angle of Departure (AoD), attenuation, and Time of Flight (ToF) of the \( \ell \)-th path, respectively. The steering vector \( a(\phi_\ell) \) represents the relative phase shift introduced by each path at every antenna element (out of \( N \) elements):
\[
a(\phi_\ell) = \left[1, e^{-j 2\pi \frac{d}{\lambda} \sin(\phi_\ell)}, \ldots, e^{-j 2\pi (N-1) \frac{d}{\lambda} \sin(\phi_\ell)}\right]^T.
\]

In the frequency domain, the channel at subcarrier \( k \) is written as:
\[
h(k) = \sum_{\ell=0}^{L-1} a(\phi_\ell) \gamma_\ell e^{j 2\pi (f_c + k \Delta f) \tau_\ell},
\]
where \( f_c \) is the center frequency and \( \Delta f \) is the subcarrier spacing.

#### Single-Beam vs. Multi-Beam

The traditional single-beam pattern creates a directional pattern along the strongest path (Line-of-Sight (LOS) or one of the reflectors). Assuming \( \phi_0 \) is the direction of the strongest path, the single-beam antenna weights are:
\[
w_{\text{single}} = \frac{a^*(\phi_0)}{||a(\phi_0)||} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \left[1, e^{j 2\pi \frac{d}{\lambda} \sin(\phi_0)}, \ldots, e^{j 2\pi (N-1) \frac{d}{\lambda} \sin(\phi_0)}\right]^T.
\]

The single-beam SNR, assuming it severely attenuates other channel paths, consists only of the strongest path:
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{single}} = \frac{|\gamma_0|^2 P_s}{P_\eta}.
\]

Instead, we design phase-coherent multi-beam patterns that exploit \( B \) channel directions out of \( L \) paths:
\[
w_{\text{multi}} = \frac{\sum_{b=0}^{B-1} a^*(\phi_b) \gamma_b e^{j \sigma_b}}{\left|\left|\sum_{b=0}^{B-1} a^*(\phi_b) \gamma_b e^{j \sigma_b}\right|\right|},
\]
where the \( B \) beams are oriented along the \( B \) strongest paths in the channel. When \( B = L \), the multi-beam weights are the same as the optimal weights:
\[
w_{\text{multi}} = w_{\text{opt}}, \quad \text{when} \quad B = L.
\]

The SNR for the multi-beam system is:
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{multi}} = \frac{\sum_{b=0}^{B-1} |\gamma_b|^2 P_s}{P_\eta},
\]
which converges to the optimal SNR when \( B = L \). The capacity of the multi-beam link is:
\[
C_{\text{mb}} = \log_2(1 + \text{SNR}_{\text{multi}}).
\]

The optimal ML beamformer requires per-antenna channel estimates, which have high complexity in terms of beam probing overhead [14]. Since mmWave channels are sparse and typically have only 1 or 2 strong reflected paths in addition to the direct path, a multi-beam with 2-3 beams provides SNR gain comparable to the optimal beam with significantly lower overhead.

### Simulation Results: 28 GHz vs. 60 GHz Links

To compare the performance of 28 GHz and 60 GHz links, we conducted a simulation study using Wireless Insite [95]. The simulation scenario is shown in Figure 16(a), where a directional link is established at 10 meters with a reflecting surface (made of concrete material) at 60 degrees. Other simulation parameters were set according to a recent large-scale study of a 60 GHz system [2].

The results in Figure 16(b) show that our multi-beam approach (mmReliable) outperforms the single-beam baseline [12] by a factor of 1.18 in throughput for a static user equipment (UE) with 10% blockages. Both 28 GHz and 60 GHz systems perform similarly, and the results are consistent across multiple UE locations. However, the 28 GHz throughput is 4.7 times higher than the 60 GHz throughput (not shown) for the same bandwidth due to higher path loss and attenuation at 60 GHz caused by environmental absorption. For longer links (AoD ≥ 15 degrees), the 28 GHz performance is better because 60 GHz links suffer from larger path loss and atmospheric absorption.

| User Location (AoD in Degrees) | 0° | 5° | 10° | 15° | 20° | 25° | 30° |
|--------------------------------|----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Throughput Gain                | 1.0 | 1.05 | 1.1 | 1.15 | 1.2 | 1.25 | 1.3 |
