### Overview of Security and Privacy in the Decentralised Web (DW)

A comprehensive overview of various protocols can be found in [21]. Researchers have also explored security and privacy in the DW, primarily focusing on securing data management [40, 44]. For instance, several projects have attempted to decentralize data, such as DataBox [38], SOLID [32], and SocialGate [26]. These projects operate local datastores for individual users, often running on physical home appliances. Applications that wish to access user data must be granted permission, typically through prior negotiation mechanisms.

### Social Network Measurements

Numerous measurement studies have analyzed "centralized" social networks like Facebook [39, 49] and Twitter [10, 15, 27]. These studies have revealed various properties, including attributes of the social graph and content generation. Bielenberg et al. conducted the first study of a DW application, Diaspora [5], and found that its network was significantly smaller than what is observed on Mastodon. Recent works have focused on Mastodon, with Zignani et al. collecting and releasing datasets, as well as exploring features such as the social graph, placement of instances, and content warnings [54, 55]. Other studies have concentrated on friend recommendations [47] and sentiment analysis [9]. Our work complements these by focusing on availability and key aspects of federation, as well as the nature and deployment of instances and their topical interests. To our knowledge, this paper represents the largest study of Mastodon to date.

### Conclusion

This paper presents a large-scale measurement study of the Decentralised Web (DW) through the lens of Mastodon. We focused on two key innovations introduced by the DW: (i) the decomposition of a global service into many independent instances; and (ii) the process of federation, whereby these instances collaborate and interact.

We found that Mastodon's design, which allows anyone to establish an independent instance, has led to a vibrant ecosystem with instances covering a wide variety of topics. However, our work also uncovered apparent forms of centralization within Mastodon. For example, 10% of instances host almost half of the users, and certain categories exhibit significant reliance on a small set of instances. This extends to hosting practices, with three Autonomous Systems (ASes) hosting nearly two-thirds of the users.

Our simulations confirmed that these natural pressures towards centralization create potential points of failure. For instance, removing five ASes could reduce the Largest Connected Component (LCC) in the federation graph from 92% to just 46% of all users. Similarly, outages in just 10 instances can remove almost half of all toots. This is not a theoretical problem, as we discovered regular instance (and occasional AS) outages. Exploring possible mitigations, we experimented with simple replication strategies and found that availability can be dramatically improved by copying toots onto secondary instances, thereby reducing the level of centralization. Interestingly, the subscription-based strategy currently used by Mastodon is not as effective as a random strategy due to the tendency to replicate toots onto the same set of instances where followers are based.

We argue that if these problems are ignored, the DW may risk converging towards a semi-centralized system. As part of future work, we plan to explore the longer-term properties of the DW more generally. We will also work on mitigations to some of the identified concerns (beyond the toot replication discussed in Section 5.2), including decentralized defenses against, e.g., malicious bots. One example of a possible mitigation is the existing instance blocking supported by Mastodon; our future work will investigate the impact this has on the social graph and how it can be used to filter malicious content. Importantly, we argue that mitigations and innovations (e.g., replication) should not depend on the exposure of user information to remote instances, and we plan to experiment with building privacy-preserving federation mechanisms. Finally, we intend to study the effects of hate speech activities, as well as alt-right communities like Gab [52] starting to use Mastodon forks [34].
