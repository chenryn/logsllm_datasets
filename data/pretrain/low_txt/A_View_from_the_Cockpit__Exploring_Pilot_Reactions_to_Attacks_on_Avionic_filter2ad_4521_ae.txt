### IX. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we examine the effects of three wireless interference attacks on avionic systems, specifically with respect to flight crew responses. We implemented these attacks in a flight simulator and tested the reactions of 30 commercial pilots. Our results show that all three attacks have the potential to cause disruption, which could lead to reduced safety, financial loss, or reputational damage. Notably, participants often had to choose between reducing distractions and turning off key safety systems, or keeping these systems operational. In over a third of cases, safety systems were switched off.

The attack on the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) was identified as the most concerning, due to its widespread inconvenience and potential to reduce safety. Both the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) and the Instrument Landing System (ILS) also pose significant problems, although they are easier to mitigate on the flight deck. We conclude that flight simulation for wireless attack awareness and training has the potential to better prepare and aid flight crews. Given that preventative security by design is not immediately deployable, such training could be highly valuable.

### APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL DETAILS ON THE ATTACKS

#### A. GPWS
A radio altimeter is a Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar, transmitting pulses on frequency sweeps between 4200 and 4400 MHz. It uses the frequency shift and round-trip time for the received signal to calculate the height above terrain, also referred to as above ground level (AGL). Its operation is illustrated in Fig. 11, where ∆t is the round-trip time, and ∆f is the frequency shift.

The attack aims to replicate the rapid closing of ground by transmitting a ramp of frequencies between 4200 MHz and 4400 MHz. The gradient of this ramp is crafted to incrementally reduce the round-trip time per frequency shift for the signal, creating the illusion of the ground approaching rapidly. This requires some prediction of the signal phase from the radio altimeter, as well as knowledge of the sweep frequency, which is standardized. Since Mode 2 alerts are based on the rate of descent, the attacker can at least calculate the target change in round-trip time (RTT) to trigger an alarm. For example, descending at 3000 ft/min (≈ 15.4 m/s) at 500 ft AGL (≈ 152.4 m) will trigger an alarm according to standard (Fig. A2b in [51]). Using a simple model of the aircraft moving a negligible amount during a pulse, we use the difference in RTT over the course of one second (i.e., the aircraft at 152.4 m AGL, then one second later having descended 15.4 m). Eq. 1 gives us the required change in RTT, in which trtt is RTT, h is height above ground, and c is the speed of light. This indicates a small jump in frequency per round-trip is needed.

\[ \Delta t_{rtt} = \frac{2(h_1 - h_2)}{c} = \frac{2(152.4 - 137.0)}{c} \approx 1.03 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s/m} \]

An attacker will need a number of directional antennae underneath the approach path to transmit to the radio altimeter. These will be fed by Software-Defined Radios (SDRs); such equipment would cost in the low $1000s. Although an attacker could operate such a system remotely, the hardware would need to be located near the runway. The ability to deploy consequently depends on the airfield security and perimeter size, an analysis of which is not within our scope.

#### B. TCAS
TCAS makes use of the Mode C or Mode S transponders fitted to an object aircraft to interrogate nearby aircraft [17]. Establishing nearby aircraft with Mode S requires the object aircraft to listen for IDs in Mode S 'squitters', which are messages in response to ground-based Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) interrogations. The object aircraft can then interrogate these IDs to calculate whether nearby aircraft will become too close [18]. An abstracted protocol diagram can be seen in Fig. 12a.

Mode C operates differently, shown in Fig. 12b. The object aircraft issues Mode C-only interrogations called all-calls, causing all nearby aircraft with Mode C transponders to respond once a second with their altitude. Since Mode C does not carry the same data fields as Mode S, the object aircraft estimates range and bearing [20]. To limit interference, it uses a whisper-shout transmission mechanism, gradually increasing power and suppressing aircraft who already responded.

Attacks on TCAS are feasible as all discussed underlying transmissions are sent in the clear with no authentication. Schäfer et al. exploit the weakness of such transponder transmissions [43], and the same fundamental wireless attack concepts can be translated to TCAS.

We first presume that we can establish the altitude, heading, and speed of the target aircraft from broadcast surveillance. The attacker can choose whether to cause the target to climb or descend by injecting an aircraft below or above the object aircraft, respectively.

Transmission by the attacker would require an off-the-shelf amplifier and antenna capable of directional transmission, with a high-powered setup costing $15,000. A transceiver is needed to both receive interrogations to establish the target aircraft's behavior and to transmit false aircraft messages.

#### C. ILS/GS
No significant technical barriers exist for an ILS attack. This is possible due to the simplistic nature of the system—while it is monitored for integrity as defined in ICAO Annex 10, this is for deviations in the legitimate signal rather than malicious interference [27]. An ILS system will normally shut down or notify ATC if excessive deviation is identified.

An attacker will need an SDR, amplifier, and directional antennae to replicate the antennae arrays used for the legitimate GS, costing around $10,000. Since no open-source tools exist to do this, software would need to be created, but this is achievable by a moderately resourced attacker as it involves implementing a standardized, static system. Furthermore, the transmission power is readily achievable with consumer amplifiers, as a typical GS is below 10 W. For reference, even the lowest level of licensed UK amateur radio operators can transmit in frequency bands surrounding aviation bands at up to 10 W [35].

Related work suggests that ILS course deviation attacks are possible using such equipment. Sathaye et al. describe two signal generation approaches that enable ILS signal interference, leading to an attacker being able to adjust the localizer or glideslope as seen in the cockpit [40]. This is fundamentally the same type of attack as we test in the simulator, made possible with the same equipment and resource level as in our threat model.

Similar to our GPWS attack, the attacker will have to locate close to the airport perimeter to have correct signal directionality along the runway.

### APPENDIX B: DEBRIEF INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

Below are the questions used in the debrief interview with participants. Each section was asked after participants had flown that scenario, with the final section being asked at the end of the session. Scales for answers match to scale points provided in App. C, Tab. VI, e.g., "Significant impact" matches to a score of 1.

1. **Glideslope**
   - During this scenario, did the aircraft perform as expected? [Yes/No]
   - In particular, did the ILS approach happen as you would normally expect it to? [Yes/No]
   - Briefly describe the impact of the ILS procedure not occurring as expected, particularly with respect to how this impacted the flight and the steps you had to take to account for this.
