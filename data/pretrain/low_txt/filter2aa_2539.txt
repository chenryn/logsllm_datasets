## Adding Trojans to Apps
- **Android Dominance**: 
  - 80% market share in 2014.
  - For more details, refer to Chapter 4a.

---

## App Signing
- **Signing Requirement**:
  - All apps must be signed to be installed.
  - Android allows self-signed certificates.
- **App Store**:
  - Google Play is the "official" app store.
  - However, Google's policing is not stringent.
  - Apps can be installed from emails, web pages, etc.

## Android Debug Bridge (ADB)
- **Overview**:
  - A command-line tool that facilitates communication with a mobile device via USB or an SVD running within an emulator.
  - Connects to the device's daemon on TCP port 5037.

- **Useful ADB Commands**:
  - **push**: Copies a file from your computer to the mobile device.
  - **pull**: Copies a file from the mobile device to your computer.
  - **logcat**: Displays logging information on the console, useful for detecting sensitive data.
  - **install**: Installs an application package file (APK) on the mobile device, useful for sideloading.
  - **shell**: Starts a remote shell on the mobile device, allowing execution of arbitrary commands.

## Decompiling and Disassembly
- **Static Analysis**:
  - Source code is generally kept confidential by developers.
  - A binary, compiled app can be analyzed by disassembling or decompiling it into:
    - Smali assembly code (used by Dalvik VM).
    - Java code.

- **Examples**:
  - **TD Ameritrade**: No obfuscation.
  - **Bank of America**: Uses ProGuard Free Obfuscator, which is ineffective.

- **Java vs. Smali Code**:
  - Comparison and analysis of both types of code.

- **Building and Signing an App**:
  - Steps and best practices.

- **Monitoring the Log**:
  - Use `./adb logcat` for monitoring logs.
  - Filter with `grep` for better results.

## Attacks via Decompiling and Disassembly
- **Common Attack Vectors**:
  - Inserting Trojan code like keyloggers.
  - Finding encryption methods and keys.
  - Changing variables to bypass client-side authentication or input validation.
  - Cheating in games.

- **Step-by-Step: Bank of America**:
  - Detailed steps and demonstrations.

- **DroidDream (2011)**:
  - Distributed primarily through the Google Play store.
  - Legitimate apps were repackaged to include DroidDream and then re-uploaded to the Play store.

- **Google's Response**:
  - Removed repackaged apps from the Play Store.
  - 50,000 to 200,000 users were already infected.

- **Google Application Verification Service**:
  - Launched in 2012.
  - Tries to detect malicious apps but is less effective than third-party antivirus solutions.

---

## Countermeasures
- **Decompiling, Disassembly, and Repackaging**:
  - Every binary can be reverse-engineered given enough time and effort.
  - Never store secrets on the client side.
  - Do not rely on client-side authentication or validation.
  - Obfuscate source code using tools like ProGuard (free) or Arxan (commercial).

- **DashO â€“ Powerful Obfuscator**:
  - Conceals all strings.
  - Costs $2000.

## Broken SSL
- **Repeating Old Work**:
  - CERT's test in 2014 found 23,667 vulnerable apps.
  - All were warned in 2014.

- **Simple SSL Test**:
  - Route Android traffic through Burp Proxy.
  - Do not install the PortSwigger root certificate.
  - This is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
  - The default browser detects this attack.

- **Demonstrations**:
  - **PicsArt (100 Million Users)**
  - **InstaChat (100 Million Users)**
  - **OKCupid (Fixed)**
  - **Safeway (1 Million Users)**

- **Broken SSL in Medical Apps**:
  - CERT found 265 vulnerable medical apps.

- **HIPAA Compliance**:
  - Importance and compliance issues.

- **My Repeat of CERT Tests**:
  - Demonstrations and findings.

- **LowestMed Response**:
  - Threatened lawsuit, but no PII beyond a certain point, so not a covered entity under HIPAA.

- **Testing New Apps**:
  - Responsible disclosure and giving companies time to respond.

- **Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina**:
  - Leaked credentials fixed in two days.

- **Security Products**:
  - **AIG MobileGuard**: Required for insurance coverage, removed from Google Play after reports.
  - **Already Trojaned!**

- **Local Storage of Sensitive Data**:
  - Examples and demonstrations of apps logging PINs and other sensitive data.
