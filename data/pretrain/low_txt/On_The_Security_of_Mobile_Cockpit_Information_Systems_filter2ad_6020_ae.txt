### Similar Avionics Systems: A Security Analysis

Our examination of three of the most popular avionics systems revealed that they are not immune to security threats. These systems allowed an attacker to compromise system integrity in multiple ways, enabling the presentation of false information to the pilot. To understand the potential impact of such attacks, we explored several scenarios where an attacker-controlled Mission-Critical Information System (MCIS) could severely compromise flight safety.

Fortunately, the vulnerabilities identified in these systems can be easily mitigated by adhering to established computer security best practices. We have presented a set of recommendations to eliminate these vulnerabilities.
