## Abstract

This paper analyzes mobile data traffic traces from a CDMA network, highlighting its unique characteristics compared to wired Internet traffic. The dataset was passively collected from the backbone of a commercial mobile service provider. Our study reveals highly uneven uplink and downlink traffic utilization, small packet sizes (often referred to as "mice" in the network), and short session lengths, reflecting user behavior in mobile data networks. We also observed a significant amount of retransmissions on the backbone and analyzed the consequences and potential causes of this phenomenon.

## 1. Introduction

The increasing availability of mobile data services has introduced new means of ubiquitous communication and entertainment, including multimedia short message service (SMS), content downloading (e.g., ring tones, mp3s, web-blog updates, e-books), online gaming, instant messaging, and multimedia streaming. Due to the high cost and unfavorable conditions in the wireless environment, the traffic characteristics of cellular networks for data services are distinct from those of wired Internet traffic.

Recent studies have analyzed traffic traces from CDMA 1xEVDO [3, 4, 5] and GPRS [2] networks, which are more suitable for carrying data traffic. However, these studies were limited to small-scale measurements at two end hosts and focused on TCP performance metrics rather than understanding user behavior and the root causes of unusual traffic patterns. Our analysis differs by investigating unique or unusual traffic characteristics that reflect user and data service patterns.

## 2. Mobile Data Traffic Characteristics

The mobile data traffic trace used in this paper covers a consecutive 12-hour period at the backbone of a commercial CDMA network. Over 85% of the total packets are less than 100 bytes, which is a significant difference from wired networks. These small packets are primarily used for signaling purposes, such as negotiating or maintaining connections, rather than transferring actual data. This observation suggests that the heavy-tailed flow length distribution theory may not be applicable to mobile data networks.

Most of the traffic is inbound, originating from content servers or WAP gateways to mobile devices. The ratios of inbound to outbound traffic in terms of packet counts and byte counts are 85:15 and 91:9, respectively. This pattern is similar to the HTTP request-response behavior, which is somewhat outdated for today's Internet.

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show that over 90% of data traffic sessions are terminated within 10-20 seconds. For UDP sessions, the proportion of sessions lasting 0-10 seconds is higher than for TCP sessions due to unwanted DNS packets. Figure 1(c) illustrates the distribution of flow lengths in the wired Internet, where longer data transmissions are common due to applications like P2P file sharing. In contrast, light SMS transfers dominate mobile data services, contributing to shorter average session lengths.

## 3. Retransmission Analysis

Figure 2 shows the total and retransmission packet counts over the 12-hour period. Approximately 80% of the total packets captured on the link are retransmission packets. Unnecessary retransmissions can waste network bandwidth and negatively impact the transparency of network usage billing.

**Figure 2: Total packet vs. Retransmission packet counts**

We selected two sample TCP sessions in a close time interval. Session A experienced a large number of retransmission packets: 237 out of 575 packets between 02:43 and 03:09. Session B, in contrast, had only one retransmission packet out of 237 packets between 02:41 and 03:01. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) illustrate the packets per second (PPS) measures over time for Sessions A and B, respectively. The PPS for both sessions remained steady at 1, but a sudden peak of 59 PPS was observed near the end of Session A, indicating retransmission attempts from the content server.

During the first half of our monitoring period, we detected 235,568 total TCP sessions, with approximately 77% experiencing packet retransmissions. Figure 3(c) shows the number of sessions sorted by their retransmission packet ratio to the total packet count of each session. Surprisingly, 38% of the total TCP sessions had a retransmission ratio of more than 0.9, meaning that 9 out of 10 packets were retransmission packets in these sessions. The majority of retransmissions in this experiment are likely not due to hardware duplication, as they occur at the end of transmission.

## 4. Concluding Remarks

This paper presents a study of mobile data traffic characteristics by analyzing traffic traces from a commercial CDMA backbone network. We observed several unique traffic characteristics, including uneven in/outbound traffic utilization, low average packet size, short session lengths, and a high retransmission ratio. While some of these characteristics resemble old patterns of wired Internet traffic, we also noted an unusually high amount of retransmissions at the backbone. This phenomenon could raise concerns about charging accuracy and performance degradation in mobile data services and may help in troubleshooting configuration issues in the service provider's network.
