# Rapid Deployment of Ransomware Prevention Measures

> [!Note]
> This guidance will be updated as new information becomes available.

Providing ransomware protection and mitigating extortion attacks is a top priority for organizations, regardless of size, due to the high impact and increasing likelihood of such attacks.

> [!NOTE]
> For a definition of ransomware, refer to the overview [here](/security/compass/human-operated-ransomware).

## Set Up Ransomware Protection Now

This guide provides concrete instructions on how to best prepare your organization against various forms of ransomware and extortion. The guidance is organized into prioritized phases, each linked to a separate article. The order is designed to reduce risk as quickly as possible, assuming a high level of urgency that may override normal security and IT priorities.

![The three phases to protecting against ransomware](media/protect-against-ransomware/protect-against-ransomware-phases.png)

**It is vital to note** that this guidance is structured as prioritized phases that you should follow in the prescribed order. To best adapt this guidance to your situation:

1. **Follow the Recommended Priorities**
   - Use the phases as a starting point for what to do first, next, and later. These recommendations are based on the [Zero Trust](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust) principle, which assumes a breach has already occurred. This approach helps minimize business risk by preparing for potential attacker access through various methods.

2. **Be Proactive and Flexible (but Don’t Skip Important Tasks)**
   - Review the implementation checklists for all sections of the three phases to identify tasks that can be completed early (e.g., configuring an underutilized cloud service). Be cautious not to delay critical tasks like backups and privileged access management.

3. **Execute Some Items in Parallel**
   - While it’s important to avoid overwhelming your team, some tasks can be done simultaneously. Different teams (e.g., backup, endpoint, identity) can work on their respective tasks while ensuring the phases are completed in the recommended order.

The items in the implementation checklists are prioritized based on their impact, not technical dependencies. Use the checklists to confirm and modify your existing configuration as needed.

> See the [3 steps to prevent and recover from ransomware (September 2021)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/07/3-steps-to-prevent-and-recover-from-ransomware/) Microsoft security blog post for an additional summary of this process.

### Phase 1: Prepare Your Recovery Plan

This phase aims to [minimize the monetary incentive for ransomware attackers](protect-against-ransomware-phase1.md) by making it:
- Much harder to access and disrupt systems or encrypt key organizational data.
- Easier for your organization to recover from an attack without paying the ransom.

> [!Note]
> While restoring many or all enterprise systems is challenging, the alternative of paying an attacker for a recovery key they may or may not deliver, and using tools written by the attackers to try to recover systems and data, is even more problematic.

### Phase 2: Limit the Scope of Damage

Make it much harder for attackers to [gain access to multiple business-critical systems through privileged access roles](protect-against-ransomware-phase2.md). By limiting their ability to obtain privileged access, you make it less profitable for them to target your organization, potentially deterring them from continuing the attack.

### Phase 3: Make It Hard to Get In

This final set of tasks raises the barrier for entry but will take time to complete as part of a larger security journey. The goal is to make it much harder for attackers to [obtain access to your on-premises or cloud infrastructures](protect-against-ransomware-phase3.md) at common points of entry. Prioritize these tasks based on how quickly you can accomplish them with your current resources.

While many of these tasks will be familiar and easy to complete, it is critically important that **your work on Phase 3 should not slow down your progress on Phases 1 and 2**.
