### Analysis of Passwords While Respecting User Privacy and Security

For researchers restricted to traditional mechanisms of password collection, such as lab or online studies and subsetting from leaked password data, we provide insights into the similarities and differences between those password sets and frequently used passwords protecting real-world, high-value accounts. Consistent with previous work [30], we find that subsetting passwords from those created under one policy to approximate passwords created under another policy is not an optimal solution. While these passwords may be similar on some metrics, their high variance makes them unreliable as proxies.

We also find that passwords created on MTurk are not a perfect substitute for high-value passwords; the simulated passwords we collected were slightly weaker than the genuine ones. However, the simulated passwords do seem to be reasonably close in several respects, including length and character composition. Furthermore, when used as training data for guessing genuine passwords, passwords from MTurk were just as effective as genuine passwords. These results indicate that passwords gathered from carefully controlled experimental studies may be an acceptable approximation of real-world, high-value passwords, while being much easier to collect.
