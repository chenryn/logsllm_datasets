## Gaining a Foothold
### Out-of-the-Box PowerShell Payloads
### Obfuscated PowerShell Payloads
- **They promised us freedom.**
- **But delivered slavery.**

### WMF 5 / Win10 1703 Security Improvements
- **PowerShell 5.1 Enhancements:**
  - Script Block Logging
  - Transaction/Transcription Logging
  - Suspicious Strings Detection
  - Constrained Language Mode
  - Just Enough Administration (JEA) Support
- **ATP Leverages Client-Side AMSI Detections for PowerShell, JavaScript, and VBScript in RS3**

### Additional Security Measures
- **Cannot Downgrade to PSv2**
- **System-wide Transcripts**
- **Common Techniques Using WScript.Shell Are Caught**
- **Forced to Use WMF 5 Even with NotPowerShell (NPS)**

### Defender ATP vs. Defender AV
- **Defender ATP ≠ Defender AV**

### Traditional Defender AV
- **By the time you read these tweets over your morning coffee, your target’s Defender AV instances were already patched...**

### Undetected Initial Foothold Techniques
- **Obfuscated JScript/VBscript Payloads (e.g., CACTUSTORCH)**
- **Using Signed Executables to Load Cobalt Stageless DNS-based Reverse Payloads**
- **Some Executables Created with Veil (Go-based) and Shellter**
  - [Payload Generation with CACTUSTORCH](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2017/07/payload-generation-with-cactustorch/)
  - [ScriptBlock Warning Event Logging Bypass](https://cobbr.io/ScriptBlock-Warning-Event-Logging-Bypass.html)
  - [Winpayloads GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nccgroup/winpayloads)

### Host Reconnaissance
- **Commands:**
  - `echo %userdomain%`
  - `echo %logonserver%`
  - `echo %homepath%`
  - `echo %homedrive%`
  - `net share`
  - `net accounts`
  - `systeminfo`
  - `tasklist /svc`
  - `gpresult /z`
  - `net localgroup Administrators`
  - `netsh advfirewall show allprofiles state`
  - `$env:ComSpec`
  - `$env:USERNAME`
  - `$env:USERDOMAIN`
  - `$env:LOGONSERVER`
  - `Tree $home`

### WMI Commands Not Detected
- **Commands:**
  - `wmic process list brief`
  - `wmic group list brief`
  - `wmic computersystem list`
  - `wmic process list /format:list`
  - `wmic ntdomain list /format:list`
  - `wmic useraccount list /format:list`
  - `wmic group list /format:list`
  - `wmic sysaccount list /format:list`
  - `Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_UserAccount -Filter "LocalAccount='True’"`

### Host Reconnaissance Using Windows APIs
- **Direct API Calls:**
  - Host-only information gathering using raw sockets, Metasploit railgun, etc.
  - MSF modules with local API calls (e.g., `file_from_raw_ntfs.rb`)
  - Avoid MSF modules like `local_admin_search_enum.rb`
  - CobaltStrike has several API-only modules

### ATP Process and Service Protection
- **Cannot stop ATP processes or services, even if running as system.**

### Uninstalling ATP
- **Unlike other PSP/cloud AV products, ATP requires a generated offboarding script with a SHA256 signed registry key.**

### Protected Process Light (PPL)
- **PPL Bypass:**
  - Defender AV service can be stopped/deleted via Project0’s privileged Antimalware PPL bypass.
  - Since RS2, ATP runs at a Windows PPL protection level and is configured as "NOT_STOPPABLE."

### Telemetry and Cloud Communications
- **ATP Sensor Communication:**
  - Uses Windows Telemetry (DiagTrack service).
  - Telemetry uses WinHTTP Services, independent of WinINet browser proxy settings.
  - Follows statically set proxy settings within HKCU.

### Blocking ATP Communications
- **Unprivileged User:**
  - Use registry commands to block ATP communications.
- **Privileged User:**
  - Block ATP communications via the DiagTrack service.
  - Block in/out traffic for WinRM, Sysmon, SCOM, etc.

### Why Block Instead of Disabling?
- **Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA):**
  - Captures and parses network traffic for authentication, authorization, and information gathering.
  - Designed to detect various attack techniques, including Pass-the-Ticket, Pass-the-Hash, Golden Ticket, and more.
  - Relies on specific Windows events (e.g., 4776, 4732, 4733, 4728, 4729, 4756, 4757).

### ATA Learning Period
- **1 Month:**
  - Abnormal behavior, sensitive group modifications, and reconnaissance using Directory Services.
- **1 Week:**
  - Encryption downgrades, brute force attacks, and other malicious activities.

### Internal Reconnaissance
- **Detected:**
  - Bulk DNS queries, nslookup, zone transfers.
  - AD Recon using SAMR protocol or tools like `net user /domain`.
- **Not Detected:**
  - LDAP/Powerview for gathering computers/users.
  - Enumeration via WMI Local Name Space.

### Lateral Movement
- **Detection (ATA):**
  - Usually detected against DCs: WMIexec, PSexec.
  - May be detected due to abnormal user behavior against domain members: WMIexec, PSexec, WinRM, DCOM, PSexec/SMBexec, RDP, Remote Registry, PSRemoting/WinRM.
- **Over-Pass-The-Hash:**
  - Detected when using KRBTGT NTLM hash.
  - Not detected when using all hashes/keys.
- **Silver Tickets:**
  - Not detected as they are forged TGS, valid for specific Kerberos services without contacting the DC.
- **SQL Authentication:**
  - SQL authentication events are local to the server.
  - Target sa accounts and compromise SQL servers with privileged AD user sessions using tools like PowerUpSQL.
  - Cross-Forest SQL trusts can also be targeted.

### Dominance
- **Detected (ATA):**
  - DCSync.
- **Partial Detection:**
  - Copying NTDS.dit file remotely using WMI.
- **Not Detected:**
  - PSRemoting with LSASS injection.
  - PSRemoting with raw disk access.
- **Golden Tickets:**
  - Detected when using KRBTGT NTLM hash.
  - Not detected when using AES keys.

### Blue Team Takeaways
- **Limit PS Remoting sources to dedicated admin workstations.**
- **Use JEA (Just Enough Administration) to prevent lateral movement success.**
- **Harden SQL servers and review forest trusts.**
- **Integrate SIEM/VPN logs into ATA.**
- **Use Event Log Forwarding for sysmon and WMI logging with shorter polling times.**
- **Integrate all new Defender-branded tools like Exploit Guard.**

### Red Team Takeaways
- **Return to living off the land and directly call APIs.**
- **Leverage host-based PowerShell tools only after blocking or disabling ATP and event log forwarding.**
- **Review RDP/PS/Session history to avoid user behavior analytics.**
- **Block event log forwarding to prevent Sysmon/WMI/PowerShell/Security logs from giving you away.**
- **Focus on info gathering and lateral movement techniques that do not communicate with the DC, such as SQL auth and Silver Tickets.**
- **Use AES for Over-PTH and Golden Tickets.**
- **Abuse Forest Trusts.**
