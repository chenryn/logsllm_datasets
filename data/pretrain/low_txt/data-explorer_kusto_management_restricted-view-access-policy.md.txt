# Restricted View Access Policy

The restricted view access policy is an optional security feature that controls view permissions on specific tables within a database. By default, this policy is disabled. When enabled, it adds an additional layer of permission requirements for principals to access and view the table.

For a table with an enabled restricted view access policy, only principals assigned the [UnrestrictedViewer](./access-control/role-based-access-control.md) role have the necessary permissions to view the table. Even principals with roles such as Table Admin or Database Admin are restricted unless they are also granted the UnrestrictedViewer role.

> [!NOTE]
> The UnrestrictedViewer role must be combined with another role assigned at the database level, such as Database Admin, Database User, or Database Viewer. If a principal does not have any of these prerequisite roles, they will not be able to query the database, which means they will not be able to query any table within the database.

While the restricted view access policy is specific to individual tables, the UnrestrictedViewer role operates at the database level. Therefore, a principal with the UnrestrictedViewer role has view permissions for all tables within the database. For more detailed information on managing table view access, see [Manage view access to tables in Azure Data Explorer](manage-table-view-access.md).

## Limitations

- The restricted view access policy cannot be configured on a table where a [Row Level Security policy](./row-level-security-policy.md) is enabled.
- A table with the restricted view access policy enabled cannot be used as the source of a materialized view. For more information, see [materialized views limitations and known issues](materialized-views/materialized-views-limitations.md#the-materialized-view-source).
