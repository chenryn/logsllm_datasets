### Security Research on Browser Extensions and Fingerprinting

Several security researchers have previously focused on the vulnerabilities associated with browser extensions, as documented in various blog posts [14], [23], [29], [30]. Sjösten et al. [47] conducted the first large-scale study, demonstrating how extensions expose Web Accessible Resources (WARs), which allow websites to identify and enumerate the installed extensions in a user's browser. Concurrently, Starov and Nikiforakis [52] proposed using Document Object Model (DOM) modifications as behavior-based fingerprints for extensions. They also conducted a user study involving 854 participants, finding that 14.1% of them had unique sets of extensions that could be detected by any website, thus uniquely identifying them. More recently, Gulyas et al. [24] performed a large-scale user study with over 16,000 participants, using the fingerprinting technique from [47], and found that 54.86% of users were uniquely identifiable based on their installed extensions.

An alternative approach, relying on a timing-based side-channel attack, was proposed by Sanchez-Rola et al. [44]. This attack exploits the access control mechanisms enforced by browsers to prevent unauthorized access to extension resources, thereby revealing the existence or absence of specific extensions. Van Goethem and Joosen [56] presented a variation of this time-based attack, exploring fingerprinting techniques that can link users' isolated browsing sessions.

### Privacy Implications of Browser Extensions

In addition to the fingerprintability of extensions, prior work has explored the privacy risks associated with them. Motivated by the seminal work of Krishnamurthy and Wills on privacy diffusion on the web [31] and leakage in requests to third parties [32], Starov and Nikiforakis developed a dynamic analysis framework to detect information leakage (e.g., browsing history and search queries) from Chrome extensions to third parties [51]. Recent studies have also demonstrated how publicly available data can enable the inference of sensitive information [17] or lead to the de-anonymization of users [54].

### Conclusions

As browser vendors implement countermeasures against cookie-based tracking, user tracking techniques that rely on browser fingerprinting are becoming more prevalent. Modern browsers have introduced or announced mechanisms to mitigate these techniques. However, recent research has exposed vulnerabilities in these countermeasures and proposed additional measures. In this paper, we present the largest study to date on the unicity of extension fingerprints, revealing their discriminatory effect in real-world settings. Our findings show that attackers can use these fingerprints to uniquely identify a device and track users, and we outline a de-anonymization attack leveraging publicly available extension reviews to reveal a user's identity. We also conducted the first detailed study on how attackers can infer sensitive or personal user information from detected extensions. The practicality of our attacks is highlighted by our comprehensive exploration of multiple extension fingerprinting techniques, including two novel approaches, and their evaluation under practical settings. Our experimental evaluation also demonstrated the robustness of our fingerprinting techniques against state-of-the-art countermeasures proposed by the research community, thus motivating the need for additional research on potential countermeasures. Overall, we hope that our research sheds more light on the risks users face and leads to a more critical view of extensions.
