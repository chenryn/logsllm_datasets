## Abstract
This paper investigates the dynamics of scam hosting infrastructure, with a particular focus on fast-flux service networks. By monitoring changes in DNS records of over 350 distinct spam-advertised domains collected from 115,000 spam emails, we measure the rates and locations of remapping DNS records and the frequency of "fresh" IP address usage. Our findings indicate that, despite the short-lived nature of scams, their hosting infrastructure exhibits relatively persistent features that may aid in detection.

## 1. Introduction
Online scam hosting infrastructure is crucial for the profitability of spam campaigns; victims must contact point-of-sale websites, which must be highly available and dynamic to evade detection and blocking. Historically, many scam sites were hosted by a single IP address for extended periods (up to a week). However, simple countermeasures like IP blocking have led to more sophisticated techniques, such as the rise of "fast-flux service networks," which allow rapid changes in hosting infrastructure.

This study examines the dynamics of the Internet infrastructure hosting point-of-sale sites for email scam campaigns, focusing on the use of fast-flux service networks. Our goal is to better understand the characteristics of this infrastructure and to identify invariant features that may help in faster detection of scams and the spam messages advertising them.

We analyzed 384 domains involved in 21 scam campaigns, extracted from over 115,000 spam emails collected over a month at a large spam sinkhole. Our study focuses on two main aspects:
1. **Rates and Extent of Change:** We examine the rates at which scam infrastructures, using fast-flux service networks, redirect clients to different authoritative name servers or Web sites. We find that while the DNS TTL values of scam sites are similar to those of legitimate load-balancing activities, the rates of change differ significantly.
2. **Mechanics of Change:** We investigate how scam hosting infrastructures change the Web servers to which clients are redirected. We monitor changes in authoritative nameservers, A records, and the IP addresses of NS records. We find that behavior varies by campaign, with many scam campaigns changing all three types of mappings, unlike most legitimate load-balancing activities which only involve changes to A records.

### Background
Fast-flux is a DNS-based method used by cybercriminals to organize, sustain, and protect their service infrastructures, such as illegal web hosting and spamming. Similar to techniques used by content distribution networks (CDNs) like Akamai, fast-flux domains are served by many distributed machines, and short TTL values allow quick changes in domain-to-IP mappings. This renders traditional blacklisting largely ineffective. Table 1 illustrates an example of a fast-flux domain, pathsouth.com, monitored on January 20, 2008.

### Related Work
The operation of fast-flux service networks and their use in spam was first detailed by the Honeynet Project. Our study is the largest to date, focusing on the location within the DNS hierarchy of dynamics and the behavior of hosting infrastructure across campaigns. We use both spam trap data and content-based scam campaign clustering, drawing on previous studies that analyzed spam trap data or performed content-based analysis. Previous work has also used passive DNS monitoring to study the dynamics of botnets, some of which are now believed to host fast-flux networks.

## 2. Data Collection
Our data collection and processing involve three steps: (1) passive collection of spam data, (2) active DNS monitoring of domains, and (3) clustering of spam and DNS data by scam campaign. We collected 3,360 distinct domain names from spam emails received at a large spam sinkhole from October 1, 2007, to December 31, 2007. We used a URL pattern matcher to extract URLs from the message bodies and an iterative resolver to resolve every domain name every five minutes. The resolver recorded DNS mappings at each level of the DNS hierarchy, allowing us to monitor fast-flux networks for changes in A records, NS records, and the IP addresses of NS records. To avoid caching effects, the resolver randomly selected a DNS root server for each query.

To compare the dynamics of scam domains with "legitimate" domains, we used the same iterative resolution process to study the 500 most popular web server domains according to Alexa. We clustered spam messages into scam campaigns based on the content retrieved from the URLs, grouping emails whose URLs retrieve common content. Table 2 summarizes the data for the three campaigns that used the most hosting servers.

### Limitations
Our data is derived from a single spam trap, which may introduce some bias. However, since we focus on widespread campaigns, this limitation should not significantly affect our results. Another limitation is that our data may not include all domains for a particular scam. Some measurements occurred months after the spam was received, but our results suggest that the dynamics of these domains remain consistent over the monitored period.

## 3. Dynamics
We studied three aspects of dynamics:
1. **Rate of Change:** We examined the rates at which DNS records change at each level of the hierarchy and the corresponding TTL values. We found that scam sites have slightly shorter A record TTL values than popular websites, but both classes have a wide range of TTL values. Almost all scam domains had NS record TTL values longer than a day.
2. **Accumulation of New IPs:** We analyzed the rate at which new IP addresses are accumulated by scam hosting infrastructure, both overall and by campaign.
3. **Location of Changes:** We determined where changes occur in the DNS hierarchy, comparing these with the behavior of 500 popular Alexa-listed sites.

Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the distribution of average time between changes for A, NS, and IP of NS records, and the cumulative distribution of unique IP addresses over time for different campaigns.

## 4. Topological and Geographical Location
We also analyzed the topological and geographical locations of scam hosts and the countries in which the domains were registered. Table 3 shows that about 70% of the 384 scam hosting domains were still active and registered with just eight registrars, primarily in China, India, and the US.

## 5. Conclusion
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of online scam hosting infrastructure, focusing on the role of fast-flux service networks. Our findings highlight the persistent features of this infrastructure and suggest potential avenues for faster detection of scams and the spam messages that advertise them. Future work will explore additional methods for identifying and mitigating these threats.
