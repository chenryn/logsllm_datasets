### Troubleshooting XMS .NET Problems

#### Overview
This section provides troubleshooting information to help you solve problems with running XMS .NET applications.

#### Related Tasks
- **Tracing XMS .NET Applications** (Page 468)
  - If you are using IBM MQ classes for XMS .NET Framework, you can configure trace from an application configuration file as well as from the XMS environment variables.
  - If you are using IBM MQ classes for XMS .NET (.NET Standard and .NET 6 libraries), you must configure trace from the XMS environment variables. You can select the components that you want to trace. Trace is normally used under the guidance of IBM Support.

- **Contacting IBM Support** (Page 301)

#### Developing XMS .NET Applications
- **Troubleshooting Tips for XMS .NET Problems**
  - Use these tips to help you troubleshoot problems with using XMS .NET.

##### Common Issues
- **XMS Application Cannot Connect to a Queue Manager (MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED)**
  - The XMS .NET client may have different behavior from the IBM MQ JMS client. Therefore, you may find that your XMS application cannot connect to your queue manager, although your JMS application can.
  - **Solutions:**
    - Try using a user ID that is no more than 12 characters long and is authorized completely in the queue manager's authority list.
    - Use security exits if the above solution is not ideal.
    - Set the `XMSC_USERID` property of the connection factory to match the user ID and password of the logged-on user. If not set, the queue manager uses the user ID of the logged-on user by default.
    - User authentication for IBM MQ is performed using the details of the currently logged-on user, not the information provided in the `XMSC.USERID` and `XMSC.PASSWORD` fields. For more information on authentication, see Connection Authentication.

- **Connection Redirected to the Messaging Engine**
  - When connecting to a WebSphere Application Server 6.0.2 service integration bus, all connections may be redirected from the original provider endpoint to the messaging engine chosen by the bus. The connection will always be redirected to a host server specified by the host name, rather than by an IP address. Therefore, you may experience connection problems if the host name cannot be resolved.
  - **Solution:**
    - Provide a mapping between the host names and IP addresses on your client host machine. For example, you can specify the mapping in a local hosts table on your client host machine.

- **Support for Telnet-Like Password Authentication**
  - The XMS .NET Real Time Transport protocol supports only simple telnet-like password authentication and does not support Quality Of Protection.

- **Setting Values for Property Type Double**
  - On a Windows 64-bit platform, the `SetDoubleProperty()` or `GetDoubleProperty()` methods may not work correctly when setting or getting values for the property type double if the values are smaller than `Double.Epsilon`.
  - **Example:**
    - If you try to set a value of `4.9E-324` for a property with type double, the Windows 64-bit platforms treat it as `0.0`. In a distributed messaging environment, if a JMS or another application sets the value for a double property as `4.9E-324` on any AIX, Linux, or Windows 32-bit machine, and XMS .NET runs on a 64-bit machine, the value returned by `GetDoubleProperty()` is `0.0`. This is a known issue with Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0.

- **Resolving FileLoadException Errors for amqmxmsstd.dll**
  - From IBM MQ 9.3.1, if you try to run a .NET Framework application using the .NET 6 based `amqmxmsstd.dll` client library and the application was compiled using the `amqmxmsstd.dll` client library from a version lower than IBM MQ 9.3.1, this causes .NET to throw a `FileLoadException` error.
  - **Solution:**
    - Copy the `amqmxmsstd.dll` library present in `MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH/bin/netstandard2.0` to the directory from where the .NET Framework application is running.

- **Common SSL Error Codes Thrown by XMS .NET Client Libraries**
  - From IBM MQ 9.3.3, improvements to the XMS .NET client (`amqmxmsstd.dll`) diagnostic messages provide a more specific exception mechanism for SSL-related issues.
  - **Table 7. Comparison of Error Messages:**
    - The following table shows some scenarios where, from IBM MQ 9.3.3, XMS .NET client libraries throw errors that are aligned with other client .NET libraries:
      | Scenario | Error Message Before IBM MQ 9.3.3 | Error Message from IBM MQ 9.3.3 |
      |----------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
      | Incorrect SSL key repository parameter | 2059 – 2381 – MQRC_Q_MGR_NOT_AVAILABLE | 2381 – MQRC_KEY_REPOSITORY_ERROR |
      | Invalid cipher suite | 2538 – 2393 – MQRC_HOST_NOT_AVAILABLE | 2393 – MQRC_KEY_REPOSITORY_ERROR |
      | Invalid peer name | 2059 – 2399 – MQRC_Q_MGR_NOT_AVAILABLE | 2399 – MQRC_SSL_PEER_NAME_ERROR |
      | Peer names do not match | 2059 – 2398 – MQRC_Q_MGR_NOT_AVAILABLE | 2398 – MQRC_SSL_PEER_NAME_ERROR |
      | Invalid certificate | 2059 – 2393 – MQRC_Q_MGR_NOT_AVAILABLE | 2393 – MQRC_KEY_REPOSITORY_ERROR |
      | Channel does not provide a cipher suite | 2059 – 2393 – MQRC_Q_MGR_NOT_AVAILABLE | 2393 – MQRC_KEY_REPOSITORY_ERROR |
      | Mismatch between cipher suite algorithms | 2059 – 2393 – MQRC_Q_MGR_NOT_AVAILABLE | 2393 – MQRC_KEY_REPOSITORY_ERROR |
      | No permission to folder for key repository | 2059 – 2393 – MQRC_Q_MGR_NOT_AVAILABLE | 2393 – MQRC_KEY_REPOSITORY_ERROR |

- **IBM MQ for z/OS Performance Constraints**
  - Use this topic to investigate z/OS resources that can cause performance constraints.
  - **Log Buffer Pools:**
    - Insufficient log buffers can cause applications to wait until a log buffer is available, which can affect IBM MQ performance. RMF reports might show heavy I/O to volumes that hold log data sets.
    - **Parameters to Tune Log Buffers:**
      - `OUTBUFF`: Controls the size of the output buffer (in the range 40 KB through 4000 KB).
      - `WRTHRSH`: Controls the number of buffers to be filled before they are written to the active log data sets (in the range 1 through 256).
      - `LOGLOAD`: Specifies the number of log records that are written between checkpoint records (range 200 through 16,000,000).

- **Buffer Pool Size:**
  - Incorrect specification of buffer pool size can adversely affect IBM MQ performance. The smaller the buffer pool, the more frequently physical I/O is required. RMF might show heavy I/O to volumes that hold page sets.

- **Distribution of Data Sets on Available DASD:**
  - Place log data sets on low usage volumes with log n and log n+1 on different volumes. Ensure that dual logs are placed on DASD on different control units and that the volumes are not on the same physical disk.

- **Distribution of Queues on Page Sets:**
  - The distribution of queues on page sets can affect performance. RMF reports might show heavy I/O to volumes containing the affected page sets. You can assign queues to specific page sets by defining storage class (STGCLASS) objects specifying a particular page set, and then defining the STGCLASS parameter in the queue definition.

- **Distribution of Queues on Coupling Facility Structures:**
  - The distribution of queues on Coupling Facility structures can affect performance. A queue sharing group can connect to up to 64 Coupling Facility structures, one of which must be the administration structure. You can use the remaining 63 Coupling Facility structures for IBM MQ data with each structure holding up to 512 queues.

- **Limitation of Concurrent Threads:**
  - The number of tasks accessing the queue manager can also affect performance, particularly if there are other constraints, such as storage, or there are many tasks accessing a few queues. The symptoms can be heavy I/O against one or more page sets, or poor response times from tasks known to access the same queues. The number of threads in IBM MQ is limited to 32,767 for both TSO and Batch.

- **Using the IBM MQ Trace for Administration:**
  - Although you might have to use specific traces on occasion, using the trace facility has a negative effect on the performance of your systems. Consider what destination you want your trace information sent to. Using the internal trace table saves I/O, but it is not large enough for traces that produce large volumes of data.

- **IBM MQ for z/OS Recovery Actions:**
  - Use this topic to understand some of the recovery actions for user-detected and queue manager-detected errors. IBM MQ for z/OS can recover from program checks caused by incorrect user data. A completion and reason code are issued to the caller. These codes are documented in IBM MQ for z/OS messages, completion, and reason codes.
