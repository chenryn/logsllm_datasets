## Introduction

### Who is l0stkn0wledge?
- **Professional Experience**: Over five years of direct work with FIPS 140, having reviewed hundreds of implementations.
- **Outside Interests**: 
  - Programmer
  - Lock picker
  - Security enthusiast

### Why am I Here?
- **Objective**: To shed new light on security standards.
- **Context**: Security standards are often criticized as being meaningless, but they can serve as a valuable starting point.
- **Limitations**:
  - Standards do not protect against everything.
  - They can become outdated and take time to maintain.
  - Enforcement ultimately relies on administrators or end-users.
  - They may provide a false sense of security.

## Understanding FIPS 140

### What is FIPS 140?
- **Definition**: Federal Information Processing Standard 140, which defines requirements for cryptographic systems used in sensitive government systems.
- **Key Entities**:
  - Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)
  - National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
  - Communications Security Establishment of Canada (CSEC)
- **Adoption**: Increasingly accepted in non-government sectors.

### Past, Present, and Future of FIPS 140
- **FIPS 140-1**:
  - Published in 1994.
  - Validations under this standard remain valid.
- **FIPS 140-2**:
  - Published in 2001.
  - Current standard.
- **FIPS 140-3**:
  - Currently in draft form.
  - Drafting began in 2005.
  - Publishing date is unknown.

### The Validation Process
- **Parties Involved**:
  - Product vendors
  - Accredited Labs (over 15 labs)
  - CMVP (NIST and CSEC)
- **Process**:
  - Vendors submit products for validation.
  - Labs conduct tests and generate reports.
  - Government reviews lab reports and issues certificates.
- **Challenges**:
  - Variance in testing due to multiple labs.
  - Consistency in enforcement and interpretation.

### Key Components of FIPS 140-2
- **Core Documents**:
  - **FIPS 140-2 Standard**: Defines requirements and terminology.
  - **Derived Test Requirements (DTR)**: Detailed information on required tests.
  - **Implementation Guidance (IG)**: Provides clarification and ties back to the standard and DTR.
- **Security Levels**: Four increasing levels of security.

### Eleven Sections of Security
1. **Cryptographic Module Specification**
2. **Cryptographic Ports and Interfaces**
3. **Roles, Services, and Authentication**
4. **Finite State Model**
5. **Physical Security**
6. **Operational Environment**
7. **Cryptographic Key Management**
8. **EMI/EMC**
9. **Self-Tests**
10. **Design Assurance**
11. **Mitigation of Other Attacks**

### Detailed Requirements
- **Cryptographic Module Specification**:
  - Defines approved behavior.
  - Level 1 and 2: Behavior enforced by user configuration.
  - Level 3 and 4: Behavior enforced through configuration.
- **Cryptographic Ports and Interfaces**:
  - Views module as a black box.
  - Level 1 and 2: No physical or logical separation of critical data.
  - Level 3 and 4: Physical or logical separation of critical data.
- **Roles, Services, and Authentication**:
  - Level 1: No authentication.
  - Level 2: Role-based authentication.
  - Level 3 and 4: Identity-based authentication.
- **Password Requirements**:
  - Fall short of required security.
  - Simple passwords meet the criteria.
  - No restriction on types of passwords.
- **Physical Security**:
  - Not applicable to software modules.
  - Level 1: No physical security.
  - Level 2: Opacity and tamper evidence.
  - Level 3: Tamper response.
  - Level 4: Tamper detection.
- **Operational Environment**:
  - Level 1: Single-user mode.
  - Level 2+: Requirement for Common Criteria (CC) validated operating systems.
- **Cryptographic Key Management**:
  - Random Number Generation
  - Key Generation
  - Key Establishment
  - Key Entry/Output
  - Key Storage
  - Key Zeroization
- **Self-Tests**:
  - Power-up Self-Tests
  - Conditional self-tests
  - Continuous RNG Test
  - Pairwise consistency test
  - Firmware load test
  - Bypass Test
  - Manual Key Entry Test

### Best and Worst of the Requirements
- **Best**:
  - Enforcing stronger algorithms.
  - Physical security at higher levels.
  - Bypass tests.
- **Worst**:
  - Limitations on physical security testing.
  - Limited zeroization requirement.
  - Hardware-centric.
  - No key storage protection required.
  - Ignorant of side-channel attacks.

## The Future of FIPS 140

### FIPS 140-3
- **Development**:
  - Over 7 years in development.
  - New requirements include:
    - Authentication enforced by the module.
    - Side-channel testing requirements at higher levels.
    - Improved zeroization requirements.
- **Timeline**:
  - Unclear, best guesses are 2012/2013.
  - Current public draft is dated.
  - Newer NIST internal drafts likely have changes.
- **Improvement**:
  - Expected to be an improvement over FIPS 140-2, though not perfect.

## Summary
- **Benefits**:
  - FIPS 140-2 provides a good baseline for security.
- **Limitations**:
  - It does not guarantee complete security.
  - Recommend incorporating the best practices into projects.
