One of the features I frequently use in Sublime Text 2 is the ability to save all open tabs and window layouts as a 'Project.' This feature is particularly useful for designers working on applications with multiple views and SCSS files. The project is saved as a `project_name.sublime-project` file, which allows me to quickly switch between different projects and return to a complex setup with a single action.

To further enhance user experience, I suggest adding more functions, actions, or default key commands to the appropriate file menus in the application bar. This would significantly improve the discoverability of features and functions. Many designers may not have experience with tools like Vim and might prefer to start using Atom with its out-of-the-box settings before customizing keybindings.

I am excited about transitioning to Atom full-time and would like to extend my sincere appreciation to your team. It's truly inspiring to see Atom evolve and come to life.
