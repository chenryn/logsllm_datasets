### Length of AS_PATH and Signature Verification Time

The length of the AS_PATH is a critical factor in determining the time required for signature verification in received route updates. In these schemes, the time required for signature verification is super-linear with respect to the length of the AS_PATH. However, PATH only requires one public key signature verification, resulting in similar convergence performance to TBGP.

### Impact of TBGP on Message Size and Memory Costs

Figure 9 illustrates the impact of TBGP on message size and memory costs in a topology with 110 ASes. The baseline average announcement message size and memory cost in our experiment are 36.09 bytes and 9 KB, respectively. On average, the message size increase in SBGP is more than 763%, while in TBGP, it is only about 96%. Compared to S-A, SAS, and PATH, TBGP achieves much better performance. For example, the average message size of BGP updates in PATH is 34 times larger than that in TBGP due to the need to generate and piggyback tree-based authentication proofs in updates.

Furthermore, TBGP significantly improves memory consumption. As shown, the SBGP scheme consumes an additional 1140% of memory to cache routes and their signatures, whereas TBGP only requires about 1.1 times more memory to cache routes, representing a 9.26 times improvement over SBGP. Similarly, memory consumption in S-A, SAS, and PATH is more than 130% higher than in TBGP. The low cost in TBGP is attributed to the elimination of the need to cache received route signatures for further propagation, thus reducing storage complexity.

### Discussion

#### Key Distribution

The prototype of TBGP adopts Identity-Based Signatures (IBS) and relaxes the centralization requirement of authorities. Different prefix/AS assignment organizations can independently generate private keys, eliminating the need for additional infrastructure and mechanisms to manage and distribute certificates. These authorities are authorized to generate and bind private keys with prefixes/ASes they are authorized to assign. Before this, PKG services provided by these authorities were necessary.

#### Convergence Time

Figure 7 shows the impact of TBGP on convergence time compared to ordinary BGP. In four different topologies, TBGP introduces 7%, 10%, 4%, and 0% extra convergence time, respectively. Notably, TBGP does not introduce extra convergence delay in large-scale topologies, such as the 208 ASes topology, because the MRAI timer of 30 seconds becomes the major cause of convergence delay. Compared to SBGP, which has a convergence time over 200% larger than ordinary BGP, TBGP achieves much better performance.

Figure 8 illustrates the impact of TBGP on the increase ratio of convergence time in the 110 ASes topology. TBGP only increases convergence delay by 4%, achieving much better routing performance compared to SBGP and other variants. For instance, the convergence performance in SBGP more than doubles, S-A introduces 9% extra convergence delay, and SAS increases convergence time by over three times at the cost of increased memory consumption. Compared to SBGP, S-A, and SAS, TBGP has 56.5, 1.25, and 75 times improvements in convergence time, respectively.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we propose TBGP, a lightweight secure BGP solution designed to prevent BGP routing attacks. TBGP enforces a set of route attestation rules in each router to simplify route attestations and build a trusted Internet routing infrastructure, thereby eliminating the need for aggregated signatures without compromising BGP security. Our prototype leverages trusted computing (TC) technology to establish transitive trust relationships between BGP speakers and uses IBS to sign and verify BGP routes, reducing the complexity of security operations in existing secure BGP solutions. Our security analysis and performance study show that TBGP meets the security goals of BGP with significantly better convergence performance and lower resource costs than traditional solutions.
