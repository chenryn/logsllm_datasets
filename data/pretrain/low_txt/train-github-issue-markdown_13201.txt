I appreciate the excellent idea of incorporating the best tools into PowerToys. I have fond memories of using PowerToys in the past.

One tool that I would love to see integrated into PowerToys is ZoomIT. This utility is invaluable for presenters and for collaborating with colleagues. For more information about ZoomIT, you can visit the following link: [ZoomIT Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/zoomit)
