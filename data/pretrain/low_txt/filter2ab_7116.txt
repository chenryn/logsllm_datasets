**Title: Practical Experiences of Building an IPFIX-Based Open Source Botnet Detector for BotConf 2015**

**Abstract:**
The academic research on flow-based malware detection has predominantly focused on NetFlow v5 and v9. However, in 2013, IPFIX (Internet Protocol Flow Information Export) was ratified as the new standard for flow export. This paper is part of a broader initiative aimed at developing protection methods for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) against botnet threats. It specifically addresses the challenges associated with designing an open-source, IPFIX-based botnet detection system.

This study details the solutions implemented to overcome these challenges and introduces an open-source system built on the Xen hypervisor and Open vSwitch. The system is designed to detect and visualize botnet traffic in virtualized environments typical of CSPs. By leveraging Euler property graphs, the system can effectively display suspected "botnests" within these environments.

The proposed framework offers a vendor-neutral, real-time detection mechanism for monitoring botnet communication traffic, not only in cloud architectures but also in the Internet of Things (IoT). This approach provides a robust and flexible solution for enhancing the security posture of modern, interconnected systems.
