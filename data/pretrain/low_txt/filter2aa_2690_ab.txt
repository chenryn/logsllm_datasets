# Authentication and Authorization

- **Irrespective of the attack vectors (old, new, or emerging):**
  - **Identity and Access Management (IAM) is crucial.**
  - **Broad scope and considerations:**
    - Enrollment, lifecycle, credentials, and key management.
    - Identity management for authentication.
    - Access control and attribute management for authorization.
    - Levels of identity or authentication assurance.
    - Monitoring for suspicious behaviors.
    - Policy enforcement, etc.

# Network Segmentation

- **Develop a stable and updated policy:**
  - Subnet-based
  - Hardware-based
  - Role or function-based
  - Usage-based

# Incident Detection and Response

- **Detect incidents as soon as possible:**
  - Disable access from the affected terminal immediately.
  - Remote erase.
  - Kill switch.
  - Monitoring and logging.

- **Key Considerations:**
  - Synchronize clocks.
  - Focus on detection.
  - Continuously verify unmonitored areas.
  - Identify and prioritize what can be "NOT NORMAL."
  - Monitor time, geolocation, and mobile devices.
  - Prepare to block threats at any time.

- **Check Outsourced Resources:**
  - Reassess what data can be outsourced.
  - Confirm terms and conditions, contracts, and SLAs.
  - Use strong authentication.
  - Check your "neighbors."
  - Regularly review access logs.
  - Ensure providers are secure.

# Post-Disaster Actions

- **Update Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans:**
  - Analyze the impact as if it had happened to your business.
  - Be aware of attacks after disasters, such as malicious emails pretending to be donations or breaking news.

# Incident Response

- **Best Practices:**
  - Be prepared before incidents occur.
  - Train and exercise regularly.
  - Identify and involve stakeholders in advance.
  - Establish a CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team).

# Communication with Others

- **Expand Your Capability to Learn from Each Other:**
  - Share information.
  - Learn from others.
  - Notify and be notified.
  - Collaborate with other companies, even competitors.
  - Engage with government agencies, including LEAs and regulators.

# Future Challenges

- **IoT (Internet of Things):**
  - IoT devices are actively penetrating highly regulated industries such as healthcare, energy infrastructure, government, financial services, and retail.
  - Key Risks:
    1. IoT devices introduce new avenues for potential remote exploitation of enterprise networks.
    2 - The infrastructure used to enable IoT devices is beyond both the user's and IT's control.
    3 - IT's often casual approach to IoT device management can leave devices unmonitored and unpatched.
  - Additional Concerns:
    - Some infrastructures hosting IoT data are susceptible to highly publicized and patchable vulnerabilities like FREAK and Heartbleed.
    - Prominent technology vendors operate their IoT platforms in known "bad Internet neighborhoods," placing their customers at risk.
    - Consumer devices continuously beacon out to servers in the US, Asia, and Europe, even when not in use.
    - Western Digital cloud-enabled hard drives are now some of the most prevalent IoT endpoints, transferring data to insecure cloud servers.
    - A survey found that 23% of respondents have no mitigating controls to prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to their company’s networks.

# Conclusion

- **Do everything we can now:**
  - Before creating or exacerbating incidents.
  - Before making excuses.
- **Keep learning and questioning:**
  - "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing." — Albert Einstein
- **Know yourself and know your enemy:**
  - If you know both, you will win many battles.
  - If you know only yourself, you will win some and lose some.
  - If you know neither, you will lose every battle.
