When I attempted to use `f2py` with Intel Fortran, `distutils` was unable to locate `ifort` on my system, resulting in a `numpy.distutils.fcompiler.CompilerNotFound` error. The root cause of this issue is that the Intel Compilers are configured to print their version information to standard error (stderr) rather than standard output (stdout). Consequently, the `subprocess.check_output` function in `numpy/distutils/ccompiler.py` could not capture this information.

To resolve this, I added `stderr=subprocess.STDOUT` to the `check_output` call. This change redirects the standard error to standard output, allowing the version information to be captured correctly. As a result, `f2py` now works as expected with Intel Fortran.
