**Title: Botconf2017 - Stantinko: A Massive Adware Campaign Operating Covertly Since 2012**

Stantinko is a botnet that we estimate has infected approximately 500,000 machines, primarily located in the Russian Federation and Ukraine. This botnet is notable not only for its widespread presence but also for its sophisticated use of advanced anti-analysis techniques, extensive encryption to conceal malicious code, and effective evasion tactics that have allowed it to remain undetected for over five years.

The primary objective of Stantinko is to perpetrate advertisement fraud. However, it also installs a backdoor, enabling the attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The Stantinko malware family has been active since at least 2012. We observed a significant shift in the group's toolset at the beginning of 2015, which made it considerably more challenging to track and analyze this threat.

When we initiated our analysis, we were initially uncertain about the nature of the malware. The fileless modular architecture of Stantinko added to the complexity, making it difficult to understand its purpose. After reverse-engineering its network protocol, we were able to gather the modules containing the actual malicious code, which gradually revealed the full scope of its activities. Our findings indicated that Stantinko engages in advertising fraud, Facebook fraud, and brute-forcing administrator credentials of Joomla and WordPress content management systems.

These discoveries confirmed that Stantinko is a crimeware botnet. In this presentation, we will share the results of our six-month investigation into this large-scale, stealthy botnet.
