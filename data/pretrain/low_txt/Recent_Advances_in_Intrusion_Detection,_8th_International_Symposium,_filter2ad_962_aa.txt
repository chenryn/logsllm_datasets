## Preface
On behalf of the Program Committee, it is our pleasure to present the proceedings of the 8th Symposium on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID 2005), which took place in Seattle, Washington, USA, from September 7-9, 2005.

The symposium brought together leading researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to discuss intrusion detection from both research and commercial perspectives. The event also encouraged discussions on broader issues such as monitoring, performance, and validation. Sessions covered topics including the detection and containment of Internet worm attacks, anomaly detection, automated response to intrusions, host-based intrusion detection using system calls, network intrusion detection, and intrusion detection in mobile wireless networks.

The RAID 2005 Program Committee received 83 paper submissions from around the world. All submissions were carefully reviewed by several members of the Program Committee, and selections were made based on scientific novelty, importance to the field, and technical quality. The final selection was made at a Program Committee meeting held on May 11-12 in Oakland, California. Fifteen papers and two practical experience reports were selected for presentation and publication in the conference proceedings. The keynote address was given by Phil Attfield of the Northwest Security Institute.

We would like to thank all authors who submitted papers, whether accepted or not. Our thanks also go to the Program Committee members and additional reviewers for their hard work with the large number of submissions. Additionally, we want to thank the General Chair, Ming-Yuh Huang, for handling conference arrangements and securing support from our sponsors. Finally, we extend our thanks to the sponsors: Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, The Boeing Company, the University of Idaho, and Conjungi Security Technologies.

### Abstract
To detect and defend against Internet worms, researchers have long hoped to have a safe and convenient environment to unleash and run real-world worms for close observation of their infection, damage, and propagation. However, major challenges exist in realizing such "worm playgrounds," including the playgrounds' fidelity, confinement, scalability, and convenience in worm experiments. In this paper, we present a virtualization-based platform to create virtual worm playgrounds, called vGrounds, on top of a physical infrastructure. A vGround is an all-software virtual environment dynamically created for a specific experiment, providing a high-fidelity, confined, and scalable testbed for studying worm behavior.
