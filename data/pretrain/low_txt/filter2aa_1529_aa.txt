### How I Got Here
- **Contagion Effect:** Exposure to suicide or suicidal behavior, directly or indirectly (e.g., through media), can influence others to attempt suicide.
- **Responsible Journalism & Social Media Standards:**
  - Use "completed" or "died by" instead of "committed" when referring to suicide.
  - Emphasize that suicide is the result of complex interactions between psychological, social, and medical issues, rather than a single factor or event.
  - Avoid presenting suicide as a means to an end, a valid coping mechanism, or an understandable solution to a specific problem.
  - Refrain from making venerating statements out of context (e.g., "She was a great kid with a bright future.").
  - Temper coverage of displays of grief.
  - Promote coping strategies and provide links to prevention resources.

### Where Do We Seek Help?
- **Online Resources:**
  - /r/SuicideWatch
  - Online crisis response networks (e.g., IMAlive)

- **Efficacy of Online Response Networks:**
  - 30% of callers to suicide hotlines hang up
  - Online response networks offer more anonymity for both the caller and volunteer
  - Efficacy appears to be equivalent, though data analysis is more challenging online
  - IMAlive provides consistent training
  - Volunteer pairing has the same "luck of the draw" as phone hotlines

### Crisis Intervention
- **Supporting a Depressed Friend:**
  - Burden of initiation on the Person In Crisis (PIC)
  - PIC assumes you are qualified, which adds to your credibility
  - Interactions have finite bounds
  - Hotline volunteers must remain anonymous
  - Therapists can set their hours of availability

- **Friendship-Based Intervention:**
  - You may need to initiate
  - Friend sees you as a peer
  - Friends may expect "always on" access
  - Lack of improvement in their situation may degrade your credibility over time
  - Emotional exhaustion

### Rethinking Our Service Model
- **Identifying Risk:**
  - Direct verbal clues
  - Indirect verbal clues
  - Behavioral clues
  - Situational clues

- **Myths:**
  - Myth: If someone is talking about suicide, they won’t do it.
  - Myth: Talking to someone about suicide might put the idea in their head.

- **Take all red flags seriously and confront them immediately.**

### Conclusion
- Let’s continue to encourage people to open up and seek help.
- Let’s also start proactively screening and responding to potential threats.

Thank you for your attention.
