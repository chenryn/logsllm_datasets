Recently, the Full Stack certificate that I had previously claimed was removed. However, the associated waypoint remained marked as completed and was repurposed for the new Back End certificate. I have since finished the additional API challenges required for the Back End certificate. Despite this, when I navigate through the waypoint again, the Back End certificate is not being added to my profile, which can be found at [http://www.freecodecamp.com/george-stepanek](http://www.freecodecamp.com/george-stepanek).
