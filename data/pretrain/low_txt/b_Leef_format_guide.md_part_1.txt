# IBM QRadar Log Event Extended Format (LEEF) Version 2

## Introduction
The IBM® QRadar® Log Event Extended Format (LEEF) Guide provides comprehensive information on constructing and implementing syslog events for QRadar products in the LEEF format. This guide is intended for all QRadar users responsible for investigating and managing network security. To effectively use this information, you should have access to QRadar products and a solid understanding of your corporate network and networking technologies.

### Statement of Good Security Practices
IT system security involves protecting systems and information through prevention, detection, and response to improper access from both internal and external sources. No IT system or product can be considered completely secure, and no single measure can prevent all improper use or access. IBM systems, products, and services are designed to be part of a comprehensive security approach, which may involve additional operational procedures and other systems, products, or services.

## Chapter 1: LEEF Overview
### Introduction to LEEF
The Log Event Extended Format (LEEF) is a customized event format for IBM Security QRadar. Any vendor can use this documentation to generate LEEF events. QRadar can integrate, identify, and process LEEF events, which must use UTF-8 character encoding. You can send LEEF events to QRadar using the following protocols:
- Syslog
- File import with the Log File Protocol

**Important:**
Before QRadar can use LEEF events, you must complete Universal LEEF configuration tasks. For more information on configuring the log file protocol to collect Universal LEEF events, see the DSM Configuration Guide.

### LEEF Event Components
The LEEF format consists of the following components:

#### Syslog Header
- **Optional Component**: Contains the timestamp and IPv4 address or host name of the system providing the event.
- **Format**: Must conform to RFC 3164 or RFC 5424.
- **Examples**:
  - **RFC 3164**: `Jan 18 11:07:53 192.168.1.1`
  - **RFC 5424**: `1 2019-01-18T11:07:53.520Z 192.168.1.1`

#### LEEF Header
- **Required Field**: Identifies your software or appliance to QRadar.
- **Format**: Pipe-delimited (`|`) set of values.
- **Examples**:
  - `LEEF:Version|Vendor|Product|Version|EventID|`
  - `LEEF:1.0|Microsoft|MSExchange|4.0 SP1|15345|`

#### Event Attributes
- **Key-Value Pairs**: Identify the payload information of the event.
- **Delimiter**: Tab or specified delimiter character.
- **Example**:
  - `src=192.0.2.0 dst=172.50.123.1 sev=5 cat=anomaly srcPort=81 dstPort=21 usrName=joe.black`

### Predefined LEEF Event Attributes
LEEF supports several predefined event attributes for the event payload. These keys help QRadar categorize and display the event. The following table describes the predefined event attributes:

| Key | Value Type | Normalized Event Field? | Description |
|-----|------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| `cat` | String | Yes | An abbreviation for event category, extending the EventID field with more specific information about the LEEF event. The value must be consistent and static across multi-language products. |

**Example Usage:**
- `LEEF:1.0|Microsoft|Exchange|2013|Login Event|cat=Failed`
- `LEEF:1.0|Microsoft|Exchange|2013|Login Event|cat=Success`

### Best Practices for LEEF Events
- Ensure consistency and static values for EventID and category fields.
- Use predefined LEEF event attributes where possible.
- Add custom event keys as needed, but ensure they are clearly defined and documented.

### Custom Event Date Format
Custom date formats can be used, but it is recommended to follow standard formats for consistency and ease of processing.

### Notices
- **Trademarks**: Refer to the Trademarks section for details.
- **Terms and Conditions**: Review the terms and conditions for product documentation.
- **Privacy Statement**: Consult the IBM Online Privacy Statement for privacy considerations.
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Ensure compliance with GDPR and other relevant privacy policies.
