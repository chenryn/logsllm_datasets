### Title: BlackHat US-20: You Have No Idea Who Sent That Email: 18 Attacks on Email Sender Authentication

Our study reveals a troubling reality: even the most diligent security professionals using advanced email services like Gmail cannot confidently determine the authenticity of an incoming email. 

We identified 18 types of attacks that can bypass email sender authentication mechanisms, including SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. These techniques allow attackers to impersonate any sender without failing authentication checks, and even to forge DKIM-signed emails with legitimate signatures.

To evaluate the effectiveness of these attacks, we tested them against 10 popular email providers (e.g., Gmail.com, iCloud.com) and 19 email clients (e.g., Outlook, Thunderbird). Our findings indicate that all tested systems are vulnerable to various forms of these attacks.

We have reported our findings to the affected vendors, who have acknowledged the issues and are actively working to address them.

The root cause of this problem is insecure composition, a growing threat in today's distributed systems. The methods we developed can be used to identify similar vulnerabilities in other systems. To assist the community in securing additional email systems, we will make our testing tool available on GitHub.
