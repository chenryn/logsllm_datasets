### Overview of Child Pornography-Related Hidden Service Websites

Many hidden service websites on the dark web are associated with child pornography. One such hosting service, Freedom Hosting, came under attack by the hacker group Anonymous during Operation Darknet due to its involvement in hosting such content.

### FBI Compromise of Freedom Hosting

In July 2013, the FBI compromised Freedom Hosting and inserted malicious JavaScript that exploited a Firefox vulnerability (CVE-PI:EMAIL). The Tor Browser Bundle, which is based on Firefox, had already been patched in its latest version, but not all users had updated their software.

The payload, known as "Magneto," reported back to servers in Virginia using the host's public IP address. It also gathered the following information:
- MAC address
- Windows host name
- Unique serial number to identify a user to a site

This exploit may be related to another tool called EgoisticalGiraffe.

### Eric Eoin Marques and Freedom Hosting

An Irish man, Eric Eoin Marques, was alleged to be the operator of Freedom Hosting. The servers were linked to him through payment records. During a police raid, Marques reportedly dived for his laptop to shut it down.

### Lessons Learned

- Do not host illegal content.
- Regularly patch and update software.
- Follow the money trail.
- Keep encrypted laptops powered down when not in use.

### Vulnerability Testing

To test if a hidden server application is vulnerable to an exploit (e.g., buffer overflow, web app shell execution), send a payload that contacts an IP you monitor.

### Silk Road and Dread Pirate Roberts

The Silk Road, operated by someone using the handle "Dread Pirate Roberts," was a platform for exchanging illegal goods and services. With over $1.2 billion in transactions, the FBI sought to uncover the identity of the operator.

### Early References to Silk Road

The earliest references to Silk Road were found on Shroomery.org forums (January 27, 2011) and Bitcointalk.org (January 29, 2011). An account named "altoid" posted about looking for an IT professional in the Bitcoin community and provided an email address (rossulbricht-at-gmail-dot-com).

### Ross Ulbricht and Dread Pirate Roberts

Ross Ulbricht's Google+ profile showed an interest in the Mises Institute, a center for Austrian economics. This was also reflected in Dread Pirate Roberts' signature on the Silk Road forums. Ulbricht's Stack Overflow account, initially under his real name, was quickly changed to "frosty."

### Investigation and Arrest

Ulbricht was identified as a suspect after connecting to a Silk Road server from an internet caf√© near his residence in San Francisco. The FBI eventually arrested him at a library while he was entering his laptop password.

### Lessons Learned

- Keep online identities separate.
- Use different usernames and locations.
- Maintain a consistent story.
- Avoid discussing personal interests.
- Do not volunteer information.
