### Methodology and Results
We developed an expressive model and validated it as characterizing an invariant property of the system using cross-validation and statistical model checking. The simulator was subjected to 55 network and code modification attacks. Our invariant detected 47 out of these 55 attacks, missing only 8 code modification attacks that had a limited effect on water tank levels. This suggests its efficacy for monitoring attacks and physically attesting the PLCs at runtime.

### Future Work
Future work should address the current complexity of the learned invariants without reducing their effectiveness in detecting attacks. This would enable the use of stronger validation approaches than Statistical Model Checking (SMC), such as symbolic execution [11]. Additionally, the approach should be made more practical for real Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) like the SWaT testbed, not just its simulator. This can be achieved by reducing the amount of data that must be collected. One way to achieve this is by applying mutations more effectively, thereby reducing the amount of abnormal data that is indistinguishable from normal traces. For example, domain knowledge can be used to focus mutation operators on parts of the PLC code that are more likely to generate useful abnormal traces.

In future work, we also aim to assess the generalizability of our approach by implementing it on other testbeds or simulators, especially those for applications other than water treatment. Finally, we plan to compare our supervised learning approach with recently proposed unsupervised ones for SWaT [5, 6] to determine whether the overhead of collecting abnormal data pays off in terms of the accuracy of the invariant and its ability to detect attacks.
