### 5.2.3 Discussions

#### ME Values in Three Cases
In the three cases discussed, the Maximum Entropy (ME) value decreases from case 1 to case 3. 
- **Case 1:** We only know the proportion of clusters joining the multicast group.
- **Case 2:** We have additional information: different clusters have different probabilities of joining the group.
- **Case 3:** In addition to the information in Case 2, we also know the pairwise correlations between clusters, which imposes more constraints on the ME distribution, resulting in a smaller ME value compared to Case 2.

#### Input Distribution Validation
The technique used in Case 3 can be shown to lead to the correct distribution if such a solution exists. However, in some cases, the given distribution may be self-contradictory. For example, if cluster A and B have high positive correlation, and B and C also have high positive correlation, but C and A have a negative correlation, it may not be possible to satisfy all these constraints simultaneously. Therefore, GEM must check the validity of the input distributions. Given \( p_i \), \( p_j \), and \( p_{i,j} \), the only constraint to consider is \( p_i + p_j \leq 1 + p_{i,j} \), which can be derived from basic probability and joint probability definitions.

#### Bounded Size Group Generation
Sometimes, we need to control the size of the groups in simulations. Constraints can be imposed to stop group creation once a certain size is reached. However, this may affect the correlations and probabilities in Case 3. A suggested method is to recompute the probabilities and correlations under the bounded group size condition, but this introduces additional computation. Future work could investigate the design of an efficient heuristic algorithm for bounded size group generation.

### 6. Experimental Validation

#### 6.1 Experiment Design
Based on our measurement results and analysis, GEM can model both MBONE applications and net games. For net games, Algorithm 1 can be used as they are characterized by uniform distribution without correlation. For MBONE applications like IETF and NASA, GEM employs Algorithm 3 due to their non-uniform distribution and strong correlations. To validate GEM, we focus on MBONE applications (IETF and NASA) using Algorithm 3.

We provide inputs such as the distributions of group participation probability, pairwise correlation of clusters, and the distribution of member cluster size to GEM. GEM then generates multicast groups. In our validation experiments, we only consider member clusters with a participation probability greater than zero, consistent with our measurement methodology. We analyze the generated multicast groups and compute the distributions of group participation probability, pairwise correlation, and member cluster size. Finally, we compare the results from real measurement data and simulation data (generated by GEM).

#### 6.2 Results and Analysis
As an example, we present the comparison results for the IETF43-Video dataset. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) curves for cluster size, participation probability, and correlation coefficient are shown in Figures 13, 14, and 15, respectively. To highlight the limitations of the uniform random model, we also plot the corresponding simulation data in Figures 14 and 15.

**Figure 13:** Comparison of cluster size distribution for IETF43-Video between measurement and modeling data.

**Figure 14:** Comparison of group participation probability distribution of clusters for IETF43-Video between measurement and modeling data (GEM and Uniform model).

From Figures 13 and 14, we observe that the CDF curves for cluster size and participation probability match "perfectly" between the measurement and GEM simulation data. For the correlation coefficient (Figure 15), the CDF curves for measurement and GEM simulation data are "nearly" matched. The difference is due to the accumulative nature of the CDF, and the CDF of the correlation coefficient involves more variables (total \( K^2 \)) than the CDF of participation probability (total \( K \)). Simulation errors accumulate over these variables.

**Figure 15:** Comparison of correlation coefficient distribution of clusters for IETF43-Video between measurement and modeling data (GEM and Uniform model).

In addition, to facilitate computation, very small (in absolute value) correlation coefficients are approximated as zero, which means the corresponding constraints can be ignored. This approximation introduces some experimental errors. Another observation from Figures 14 and 15 is that the uniform random model cannot generate realistic multicast groups, highlighting its limitations.

For other sessions, such as IETF Audio and NASA, similar results were obtained. Based on our experimental results, we conclude that our model can successfully produce group members that follow the given distribution.

### 7. Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we measured and modeled the spatial properties of multicast members. Our contributions are summarized as follows:
1. **Identification and Quantification:** We identified and quantified the spatial properties of members, including member clustering, group participation probability, and pairwise correlation, in net games and large audio-video broadcasts from IETF and NASA.
2. **Observations on MBONE Members:** We observed that MBONE multicast members are highly clustered, with skewed distribution and strong pairwise correlations in their participation.
3. **Net Game Members:** Net game members are less clustered, and there is no strong correlation between users. The uniform random membership model can roughly model net games (e.g., Quake), but this may be partially due to the small scale of the games we measured. We also observed a strong daily periodicity.
4. **GEM Model Development:** We developed GEM, a powerful group membership model that can generate realistic member distributions. GEM maximizes the entropy of the distribution while trying to match given constraints.
5. **Validation:** We validated our model with great success, as the generated groups match the real data very well.

We provide our data and model as a contribution to the community, hoping it can be part of a realistic and systematic multicast evaluation methodology.
