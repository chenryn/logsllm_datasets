### Abstract

In this paper, we introduce a novel, reproducible RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) measurement framework that emphasizes the role of relying party (RP) cache servers in providing a comprehensive and up-to-date view of RPKI data. Our deployment model, which includes child CAs and publication points, advances the understanding of RPKI systems. Initial results indicate that a significant portion of deployed RPs do not obtain a complete or timely copy of RPKI data. Refresh intervals are critical, but we have also identified systemic issues in multiple implementations that may cause RPs to lose access to child CAs and publication points. Our study suggests that up to 20% of deployed RPs may currently be affected by these issues. Given the increasing trend in both child CA deployments and RPKI-based route filtering, addressing these fetching errors is crucial to prevent larger disturbances in Internet routing.

### Introduction

Our approach enhances data transparency, allowing RP connection data to be shared and made available to third parties. We plan to extend our measurement platform to include child CAs and publication points under all Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). This is important because some operators choose not to accept the licensing agreements of certain RIRs. Future work will help us understand the prevalence of such decisions.

We also aim to further examine RP cache servers directly to complement the completeness work started here. It is essential to know not only that an RP contacted a publication point but also the outcome of that contact. Key questions include: Are RPs adhering to certificate expiration dates? Do RPs correctly validate all Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)? Are there ROAs that trigger different validation results across RP deployments due to policy or implementation differences?

Finally, we will explore whether this new data source can be leveraged outside the RPKI context, such as extending IP hit lists with RP addresses.

### Figures and Data

- **Figure 8: RP Software Popularity**
  - Shows the number of distinct RP IP addresses that fetch data via RRDP and are visible at our research PP. Each RP is mapped to RP software based on the user agent string in HTTP.
  
- **Figure 9: Set Diagram of RP IP Addresses**
  - Illustrates the overlap of distinct RP IP addresses for a single day, measured across all three PPs.
  
- **Figure 10: Average Connection Interval at Research PP**
  - Displays the refresh intervals of RPs measured at our research PP. Details for AFRINIC and APNIC are presented in Section 3.3.

### Ethical Considerations

We release all data gathered at our delegated CAs on https://rp-study.rpki.net. This will include IP addresses of the relying parties. We do not consider this data privacy-sensitive as the RPKI is a public repository.
