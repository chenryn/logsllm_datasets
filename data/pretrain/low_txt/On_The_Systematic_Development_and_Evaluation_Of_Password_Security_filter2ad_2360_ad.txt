### Systematic Creation of Awareness-Raising Materials on Password Security

#### Abstract
This study evaluates the effectiveness of awareness-raising materials in enhancing users' understanding of password-related behavior in various information security scenarios. The materials were designed to help users distinguish between secure and insecure password practices and improve their overall password security. Results indicate that participants retained or even improved their knowledge six months after reading the materials, and the materials were well-received by all participants. The study also highlights areas for future work, including the need for additional materials on password managers and secure password composition.

#### Introduction
The systematic creation of awareness-raising materials is crucial for improving password security. This paper presents a study that evaluates the effectiveness of such materials in helping users understand the security implications of their password-related behaviors. The materials were designed to be accessible to lay-users, avoiding technical jargon and using simple language and examples.

#### Methodology
The awareness-raising materials were developed through an iterative process, ensuring they were both informative and engaging. The study involved a group of employees who read the materials and were subsequently tested on their understanding of password security. Follow-up assessments were conducted six months later to evaluate long-term retention.

#### Results
The results of our study show that participants were able to accurately identify whether password-related behaviors in different information security scenarios were secure or insecure. Additionally, their understanding of password security was retained or even improved six months after reading the materials. All participants provided positive feedback on the materials.

The study also identified areas for future work. Participants expressed a desire to learn more about password managers and the composition of secure passwords. Therefore, it may be beneficial to create additional awareness-raising materials on these topics. Furthermore, investigating methods to ease the transition to using password managers could be valuable.

#### Discussion
Beyond the scope of password security, the iterative process used to create the awareness-raising materials can be applied to other information security contexts. This approach ensures that the materials are both effective and user-friendly.

#### Appendix A: Description of the Awareness-Raising Material
The awareness-raising material is designed to be understandable for lay-users by avoiding technical terms, using simple language, and providing a wide range of examples. Due to space constraints, only a high-level summary is provided here. The full, improved version of the material can be accessed online [2].

**A.1 Introductory Sections**
- **Possible Attackers**: This section provides an overview of potential attackers, including criminal hackers, social engineers, insider threats, spouses, acquaintances, and IT service providers. It also explains where these attackers target their attacks.
- **Possible Consequences of Successful Attacks**: This section discusses the goals of attackers, emphasizing the consequences while focusing on positive phrasing. Examples include accessing email accounts to send phishing emails, accessing cloud storage for blackmail, and accessing bank accounts to withdraw funds.

**A.2 Types of Attacks**
- **Fraudulent Messages**: Explains how attackers send messages to trick victims into providing credentials, following malicious links, or opening attachments. Defenses include deleting suspicious messages, verifying sender and content, and analyzing links and attachments.
- **Insecurely Stored Password Notes**: Describes how attackers obtain physically stored passwords. Defenses include securely storing physical copies and being cautious with passwords sent via mail.
- **Shoulder-Surfing**: Explains how attackers observe users entering passwords. Defenses include ensuring privacy, using privacy filters, and cleaning touch screens.
- **Compromising User Devices**: Describes how attackers use malware to compromise devices. Defenses include installing security patches, enabling automatic updates, using anti-virus software, and protecting devices with strong passwords.
- **Eavesdropping on Unencrypted Communication**: Explains how attackers intercept unencrypted communication. Defenses include using HTTPS connections and logging out from web services after use.
- **Eavesdropping on Encrypted Communication**: Describes how attackers impersonate remote services or perform man-in-the-middle attacks. Defenses include recognizing browser warnings and never downgrading HTTPS to HTTP.
- **Targeted Guessing**: Explains how attackers guess specific user passwords using publicly available information. Defenses include selecting passwords that cannot be associated with the user.
- **Untargeted Guessing**: Describes how attackers attempt to guess many user passwords at once. Defenses include choosing infrequently used passwords.
- **Guessing After a Break-In**: Explains how attackers crack hashed passwords after compromising a service. Defenses include selecting long, strong passwords.
- **Unencrypted Digital Password Notes**: Describes how attackers target unencrypted digital password notes. Defenses include using encrypted password managers and changing passwords if sent unencrypted.
- **Exploiting Weak Reset Mechanisms**: Explains how attackers exploit weak password reset mechanisms. Defenses include securing email accounts and treating security question answers as passwords.
