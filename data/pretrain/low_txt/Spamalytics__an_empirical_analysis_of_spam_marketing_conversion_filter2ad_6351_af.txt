### 8. Conclusions

This paper presents what we believe to be the first large-scale quantitative study of spam conversion. We developed a methodology that uses botnet infiltration to indirectly instrument spam emails, such that user clicks on these messages are directed to replica websites under our control. Using this methodology, we instrumented nearly 500 million spam messages across three major campaigns, allowing us to quantitatively characterize both the delivery process and the conversion rate.

We acknowledge that our results represent a single data point and may not be representative of all spam campaigns. Different campaigns, employing various tactics and marketing different products, will likely produce different outcomes. Therefore, we strongly caution against using the conversion rates we measured for Storm-based campaigns to justify assumptions in other contexts. However, it is tempting to speculate on the implications of our findings, with the understanding that many of our speculations cannot be empirically validated at this time.

After 26 days and almost 350 million email messages, only 28 sales were recorded, resulting in a conversion rate of well under 0.00001%. All but one of these sales were for male-enhancement products, with an average purchase price of approximately $100. These conversions would have generated revenues of $2,731.88, or about $100 per day over the measurement period, and $140 per day during active campaign periods. However, our study captured only a small fraction (approximately 1.5%) of the overall Storm network. Thus, the total daily revenue attributable to Storm's pharmacy campaign is likely closer to $7,000 (or $9,500 during active periods). By the same logic, we estimate that Storm self-propagation campaigns can generate between 3,500 and 8,500 new bots per day.

Assuming our measurements are representative over time (an admittedly dangerous assumption given the small sample size), we can extrapolate that, if sent continuously at the same rate, Storm-generated pharmaceutical spam would produce roughly $3.5 million in annual revenue. This figure could be even higher if spam-advertised pharmacies experience repeat business. While this is less than "millions of dollars every day," it still represents a significant and profitable enterprise.

The next obvious question is, "How much of this revenue is profit?" Here, the situation becomes more complex. First, we must consider how much of the gross revenue is actually recovered from each sale. Assuming the pharmacy campaign drives traffic to an affiliate program (which there are strong anecdotal reasons to believe is the case), the gross revenue is likely split between the affiliate and the program, resulting in an estimated net revenue of $1.75 million annually. Next, we must subtract business costs, which include fixed sunk costs (such as domain registration and bullet-proof hosting fees) and the cost of distributing the spam itself.

Anecdotal reports suggest that the retail price for spam delivery is around $80 per million emails. This cost, while significantly lower than what legitimate commercial mailers charge, is still a substantial overhead; sending 350 million emails would cost more than $25,000. Given our net revenue estimates, retail spam delivery would only make sense if it were 20 times cheaper. Yet, Storm continues to distribute pharmacy spam, suggesting that it is indeed profitable. One explanation is that Storm's operators are vertically integrated, meaning the purveyors of the pharmacy spam are the same as the operators of the botnet. There is some evidence for this, as the distribution of target email domain names between the self-propagation and pharmacy campaigns is virtually identical. Additionally, the harvesting of email addresses from the local hard drives of Storm hosts, which subsequently appear in the target address lists of both campaigns, further supports this hypothesis. Neither of these behaviors is observed in other (smaller) campaigns distributed by Storm, suggesting that those may be fee-for-service arrangements. If true, the cost of distribution is largely the labor used in the development and maintenance of the botnet software. While we cannot provide meaningful estimates of this cost, we surmise it is roughly equivalent to the cost of two or three skilled programmers.

If this hypothesis holds, it is encouraging because it suggests that the third-party retail market for spam distribution has not grown large or efficient enough to produce competitive pricing. Thus, profitable spam campaigns require organizations that can assemble complete, end-to-end teams. In other words, the profit margin for spam (at least for this pharmacy campaign) may be so slim that spammers must be highly sensitive to the details of their operations and are economically vulnerable to new defenses.

### 9. Acknowledgments

This was one of the most complex measurement studies our group has ever conducted, and it would have been impossible without the contributions of a large and supportive team. We extend our thanks for their insightful feedback and individual contributions to our effort.

Jordan Hayes provided significant assistance with site domain registration. Peter Blair, Paul Karkas, Jamie Knight, and Garrick Lau at Tucows supported this activity (once we convinced them we weren't spammers) and allowed us to use reputable registrars. Randy Bush provided overall guidance and help concerning Internet operations and policy issues, while Erin Kenneally advised us on legal matters. Brian Kantor set up and managed our DNS, Web, and SMTP servers, while Scott Campbell and Stephen Chan performed massive DNS lookups for us. Jef Poskanzer provided data access for debugging our experiment, Stephen Chenette provided technical assistance, and Fallon Chen was our in-house graphic designer. Bill Young and Gregory Ruiz-Ade set up target email accounts in UCSD’s CSE department. Special thanks to Gabriel Lawrence and Jim Madden of UCSD’s ACT for supporting this activity on UCSD’s systems and networks. Finally, our thanks to the anonymous reviewers for their time and commentary.
