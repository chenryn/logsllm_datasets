**Synopsis:**

Cloud-based infrastructures are rapidly becoming a preferred choice for hosting a wide range of applications, from high-availability enterprise services and online TV stations to batch-oriented scientific computations. With billions of dollars invested, the success of cloud computing is evident. However, it remains unclear whether cloud services can be a dependable alternative to dedicated infrastructure. While availability and privacy are significant challenges, cloud providers' economies of scale enable substantial investments in redundancy and dependability that smaller operators struggle to match. Additionally, the ability to monitor large numbers of applications can enhance security through "wisdom of crowds" approaches, similar to how network providers have managed worms and DDoS attacks.

This panel will discuss the new dependability-related challenges and opportunities in cloud computing, including:

### 1. Challenges

- **Common Mode Outages:** An environment dominated by a few large cloud providers increases the risk of common mode outages, affecting numerous applications. These providers also become highly visible targets for attackers. Community-driven sites like [1] track and document outages and security vulnerabilities, which have impacted hundreds of Internet sites over the past two years.
  
- **Resource Sharing Risks:** The sharing of cloud resources by entities with varying behaviors and best practices can expose applications to increased risks. For example, on April 26, 2008, Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) experienced an outage due to a single customer applying a large set of unusual firewall rules and instantiating many instances simultaneously, triggering a performance degradation bug in Amazon’s distributed firewall [2].

- **Administrative Complexity:** Multiple administrative domains between application and infrastructure operators reduce end-to-end system visibility and error propagation information, making problem detection and diagnosis difficult. Cloud providers may not fully disclose the causes of outages or detailed infrastructure design information, raising questions about the verifiability of dependability claims.

- **Legal and Privacy Implications:** Hosting data on outsourced and shared infrastructure in different legal jurisdictions has serious legal and privacy implications. Legislation such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 create obstacles for the financial, healthcare, and telecom industries. For instance, ITricity, a European cloud provider, could not offer services to these sectors until it began offering owner-hosted private cloud services [3]. The Cloud Security Alliance [4] addresses the interplay of cloud computing and legal requirements.

### 2. Opportunities

- **Economies of Scale:** Cloud computing enables large-scale redundancy and wide geographical footprints. For example, Amazon’s EC2 supports two regions in the US and Europe, each split into independent “availability zones,” while AT&T’s Synaptic cloud computing offers five “super IDCs” globally. Techniques like virtual machine migration and cloning can provide better fault tolerance and disaster recovery, especially for smaller applications that might not afford such capabilities otherwise.

- **Enhanced Security Services:** New security and reliability services can be enabled or strengthened in the cloud. For instance, Gmail uses manual feedback from users to provide automatic spam filtering. Oberheide et al. [5] describe a cloud-based antivirus solution that leverages multiple vendors for better coverage, compares data blocks across users for efficiency, and provides an archival service for forensic analysis.

- **Managed Cloud Services:** Managed cloud services with OS-level support can improve reliability and security through consistent centralized administration and timely application of patches and upgrades.
