### Overview of Xserve Hardware, Setup, and Safety

#### Unpacking and Removing the Protective Faceplate
To protect its precision components, the Xserve is shipped in special packaging, including a temporary plastic faceplate covering the front panel. This faceplate must be removed before opening the server or installing it in a rack.

**Important:**
- Xserve is designed for rack mounting and should not be used as a desktop computer.
- It is recommended to work with another person when handling the server.

**Steps to Remove the Server from Its Packaging:**

1. **Open the Carton:**
   - Open the carton, remove any foam or other packaging, and fold back the plastic covering the server.

2. **Lift the Server:**
   - With one person holding each side, carefully lift the unit and place it on a table.
   - **Warning:** Do not place a monitor or any other equipment on top of the server. Any weight on the server’s case could damage the internal components.

3. **Remove the Protective Faceplate:**
   - Unscrew the thumbscrews at each side of the faceplate and lift it off.
   - Remove the additional shipping screws on either side of the server (these do not need to be reinstalled unless you intend to transport the server again).

4. **Remove Plastic Film:**
   - Remove any plastic film from the front and rear of the server’s cover.

For more information about installing the server in a rack, see “Summary of Hardware Installation” on page 12.
