## Abstract
To protect against attacks, networks must enforce ingress filtering, which involves blocking inbound packets with spoofed IP addresses. Despite being a well-known best practice, it remains unclear how many networks fail to block such packets. Inferring the extent of spoofability on an Internet scale is challenging, and existing studies cover only a limited subset of Internet networks. These studies either measure networks with faulty network-stack implementations, require the installation of measurement software on volunteer networks, or assume specific properties like traceroute loops. Improving the coverage of spoofing measurements is crucial.

In this work, we present the Spoofing Mapper (SMap), the first scanner designed for performing Internet-wide studies of ingress filtering. SMap evaluates the spoofability of networks using standard protocols that are nearly ubiquitous in any Internet network. Our application of SMap for Internet-wide measurements revealed that 69.8% of all Autonomous Systems (ASes) do not filter spoofed packets, and we identified 46,880 new spoofable ASes that were not previously detected. Our measurements provide the first comprehensive view of ingress filtering deployment across the Internet, as well as the progress in filtering spoofed packets over a two-year period up to May 2021.

We have established a web service at [https://smap.cad.sit.fraunhofer.de](https://smap.cad.sit.fraunhofer.de) for continuous Internet-wide data collection and to display statistics from spoofing evaluations. We make our datasets, as well as the SMap implementation and source code, publicly available to enable researchers to reproduce and validate our results, and to continuously track changes in the filtering of spoofed packets in the Internet.

## 1 Introduction
Source IP address spoofing allows attackers to generate and send packets with false source IP addresses, impersonating other Internet hosts. This can be used to avoid detection, reflect traffic during DDoS attacks, launch DNS cache poisoning, gain spoofed management access to networking equipment, and trigger services accessible only to internal users [8, 11, 13, 32, 39]. The best way to prevent IP spoofing is by enforcing Source Address Validation (SAV) on packets, a practice standardized in 2000 as BCP38 [19], which includes ingress filtering for blocking inbound packets and egress filtering for blocking outbound packets with spoofed IP source addresses.

While egress filtering has been extensively measured over the past 15 years, only a few recent studies have provided measurements on the extent of ingress filtering. To enforce ingress filtering, networks should check the source address of an inbound packet against a set of permitted addresses before allowing it into the network. Failure to do so can allow attackers to exploit internal services and launch attacks. For example, by spoofing internal source IP addresses, attackers can obtain access to services like RPC, or spoofed management access to networking equipment [RFC3704]. They can also cause DoS amplification by triggering ICMP error messages from attacked hosts to other internal hosts whose IP addresses the attacker spoofed. Enforcing ingress filtering is therefore critical for protecting networks and internal hosts against attacks. However, despite efforts to prevent IP spoofing, it remains a significant problem, with attacks utilizing IP spoofing still widespread [8, 10, 18, 35, 38, 41].

### How Widespread is the Ability to Spoof?
Significant research and operational efforts have been made to understand the extent and scope of ingress and egress filtering enforcement and to characterize networks that do not filter spoofed packets. While existing studies and tools, such as the Open Resolver [34] and the Spoofer [5–7, 28, 30] projects, provide valuable insights, they are insufficient due to their limited and often non-uniform coverage of Internet networks.

### SMap (The Spoofing Mapper)
In this work, we introduce the first Internet-wide scanner for networks that filter spoofed inbound packets, called the Spoofing Mapper (SMap). We applied SMap to scan more than 90% of the Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the Internet. Our measurements show that more than 80% of the tested ASes do not enforce ingress filtering (i.e., 72.4% of all ASes in the routing system), compared to 2.4% identified by the latest Spoofer Project measurement [30]. This significant difference is due to the limitations of previous studies, which focused on a small set of networks.

### Limitations of Filtering Studies
Previous studies have provided essential insights into "spoofability" in the Internet, but their methods, such as installing agents on networks or analyzing offline traffic, limit their coverage and representativeness. These studies typically infer that at least 30% of Internet networks do not filter spoofed packets [30, 32]. However, our findings indicate that the number of spoofable networks is above 72%, significantly higher than previously believed.

### Requirements for Internet Studies
Key requirements for conducting Internet studies include scalable measurement infrastructure, good coverage, and representative selection of vantage points. We summarize the limitations of previous studies and compare them to SMap:

- **Limited Coverage:** Previous studies infer spoofability based on a limited set of networks, such as those with faulty network stacks or volunteers running measurement software. SMap uses standard protocols supported by almost any network, providing the first comprehensive study of ingress filtering across the entire IPv4 space.
- **Limited Scalability:** Previous approaches require installing agents, reproducing traceroute loops, or exploiting misconfigurations, limiting their scalability. SMap is more scalable, using a fixed infrastructure of probers to exchange requests and responses with networks.
- **Limited Representativeness:** Volunteer-based studies, like the Spoofer Project, are inherently biased due to the limited number of vantage points. SMap measures almost all IPv4 networks, ensuring more representative results.
- **Limited Stability:** Current studies use unstable infrastructures, leading to discrepancies in longitudinal studies. SMap's stable infrastructure allows for more accurate and reliable long-term measurements.

### Ethical Considerations
Internet-wide scans are important for security research and have proven valuable in improving the security landscape of the Internet. However, they also introduce ethical challenges. We communicated with network operators to address these concerns, focusing on traffic load and consent. To minimize traffic load, we periodically download a dataset of a full Internet scan done by Sonar. For consent, we provide an option for networks to opt out of our scans by providing their network block, domain, or ASN through our contact page.

### Organization
Our work is organized as follows:
- Section 2 compares our study and SMap to related work.
- Section 3 presents the design and implementation of SMap and the measurement techniques it uses.
- Section 4 reports on the data collected with SMap and the derived statistics.
- Section 5 characterizes the networks that do not enforce ingress filtering.
- Section 6 concludes the work.

## 2 Overview of Spoofing Studies
### 2.1 Egress vs. Ingress
Most studies of spoofing focus on egress filtering, with fewer studies on ingress filtering. What can be inferred from egress filtering about ingress filtering and vice versa?

Recent measurements of ingress and egress filtering [30] concluded that filtering of inbound spoofed packets is less deployed than filtering of outbound packets, despite the threat posed by spoofed inbound packets. [25] analyzed networks from the Spoofer and open resolver projects and found that 74% of networks that do not filter outbound spoofed packets also do not filter inbound spoofed packets. A more recent study [24] of 515 ASes found that ingress filtering of inbound spoofed packets is more widely deployed than egress filtering of outbound packets.

The correlation between egress and ingress filtering in previous work suggests that measurements of ingress filtering also provide a lower bound on the number of networks that enforce egress filtering. Therefore, our results on networks that do not enforce ingress filtering imply that at least as many networks do not perform egress filtering.

### 2.2 Measurements of Spoofability
Previous studies of networks that filter spoofed packets in the Internet used network traces or vantage points. We summarize the results of these studies in Table 1 and briefly explain them below.

**Vantage Points:** The Spoofer Project, launched in 2005 [5], was the first to measure networks that do not perform egress filtering of packets with spoofed IP addresses. The project crafts packets with spoofed IP addresses and checks their receipt on vantage points operated by volunteers who run the "spoofer" software provided by the authors. Based on the data collected by the Spoofer Project, many studies have been conducted, but they are limited in coverage and representativeness.
