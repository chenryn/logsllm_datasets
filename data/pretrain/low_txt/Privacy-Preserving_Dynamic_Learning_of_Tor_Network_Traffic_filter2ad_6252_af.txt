### 5.3 Resource Requirements and Inactive Clients

Our analysis revealed that the PrivCount model demands more computational and memory resources to run in Shadow compared to the single file and protocol models. We hypothesize that this is due to the larger number of clients in the PrivCount model. Based on our findings, we suspect that excluding inactive clients could reduce resource consumption without significantly affecting the model's accuracy. Future research should explore the impact of running fewer but more active clients on experimental accuracy and how these changes affect research conclusions.

#### 7.1 Measuring Tor

To understand the usage and performance of distributed systems like Tor, a measurement process is essential. Early studies by McCoy et al. [39] and Chaabane et al. [8] used a straightforward approach: directly logging traffic and later analyzing it for statistical insights. However, these studies faced significant criticism from the privacy community because they recorded and manually analyzed sensitive data, including packet headers and some packet payloads.

Soghoian [49] raised ethical and legal concerns, calling for better standards for safer Tor research. Loesing [37] provided guidelines for safely measuring anonymity networks and conducted a privacy-preserving study on the number of connecting clients and exit traffic by port. The privacy techniques included simple rounding and per-relay aggregation over time, though secure aggregation across relays and rigorous privacy guarantees were not considered. Our study benefits from these advancements through the use of PrivCount [26].

Despite these efforts, direct logging approaches continued to be used. For example, Ling et al. [35] measured and classified malicious traffic on Tor using the Snort intrusion detection system. More recently, Owen and Savage [42] collected unique hidden service addresses by running numerous hidden service directories and recording lookups. While these studies provide valuable insights, they lack adequate privacy protections, raising ethical questions.

Recent years have seen significant progress in privacy-preserving Tor measurement techniques. Elahi et al. [13] designed PrivEx, a system based on distributed differential privacy and secure multiparty computation. Jansen and Johnson [26] extended this work to develop PrivCount, which they used to measure a wide range of Tor traffic statistics. Jansen et al. [28] further extended PrivCount to classify circuits and webpages, measuring the popularity of hidden services. Our work builds on PrivCount to support the measurement and processing of hidden Markov traffic models. Additionally, Mani and Sherr [38] developed Historϵ, a robust distributed measurement system, while Fenske et al. [14] designed Private Set-union Cardinality, a cryptographic protocol for aggregating unique item counts.

#### 7.2 Modeling Tor

Early Tor client models were created for discrete-event simulators to explore the performance benefits of Tor incentive schemes [25, 41]. These models, which correspond to our single file models (Section 5.2.1), became an unofficial standard in Tor performance research because they were based on actual Tor measurements and it was challenging to collect new, ethically sound measurements. Our goal is to improve the accuracy and fidelity of these models using recent privacy-preserving measurement tools to create more representative models of the current Tor network.

Jansen et al. [22] first rigorously defined models of Tor network structure, including Internet paths, latency, packet loss rates, and relay and client types and distribution. Wacek et al. [51] independently improved these topologies, and Jansen et al. [23] integrated and validated them for Shadow. Our most recent model uses real Internet measurements from RIPE Atlas and the latest bandwidth data from speedtest.net. We believe our topology provides the best balance between fidelity, measurement overhead, and processing delays during simulation.

### 8. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive measurement study of Tor, focusing on clients, circuits, streams, bytes, and their distributions for modeling purposes. We also collected data to dynamically learn hidden Markov stream and packet models. Using these measurements, we designed a traffic generation model for private Tor networks and demonstrated its superiority over previous and alternative models. We identified several areas for future work, including extending the measurement of HMM stream and packet models beyond 24 hours and investigating how network accuracy impacts research conclusions across different network scales.
