# Weaknesses in Municipal Mesh Network Deployments

## Presenters
- **Dustin Hoffman**: Senior Engineer at Exigent Systems, Principal at various other concerns. (Note: The researcher, not the actor)
- **Thomas (TK) Kinsey**: Senior Engineer at Exigent Systems, Principal at 3Kappa Research

## Presentation at DEF CON 22

### What the Watchers See
The presentation began with the observation of open Wi-Fi networks, which sparked the interest in municipal mesh network deployments.

### The Transparent Society
- Reference: [David Brin's "The Transparent Society" on Wired](http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/4.12/Wransparent_pr.html)

### Motivations for Municipal Deployments
- **City Services**: Police, traffic, two-way audio, site monitoring, force multiplier, and budget constraints.
- **Network Implementation**: Wireless mesh networks are chosen for their lower costs, quicker installation, no need for trenching, and simpler permitting processes.

### Project and Integration Vendors
- Example: LeverageIS ([Website](http://www.leverageis.com/))

### Implementation Hardware
- Common off-the-shelf hardware, such as Firetide/UNICOM, Bosch cameras, and DVR/NVRs.

### Our Lab
- Detailed information on Firetide-specific filesystem reverse engineering and other technical aspects.

### Implementation Protocols
- **802.11 Standards**: 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 900MHz.
- **Mesh Networking**: Open standards vs. AutoMesh.
- **Interesting Note**: 2.4GHz is in use, though not explicitly mentioned in some documents.

### General Characteristics of Mesh Networks
- Multiple wireless paths.
- Nodes may not have a reliable connection to the backhaul.
- Protocol provides node IDs and mesh health information.

### Specific Case Study
- [Google Maps Engine](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zLPNQqdIZ4w4.klDGLs4MNr3w)
- Previously open, now secured with WEP.

### Security Concerns
- **Access to Transmission Medium** and **Node Authentication** (e.g., bank calling/GSM).
- **Link Encryption** and **Content Encryption**.
- **Node Authentication via PKI** (not always enabled).
- **AutoMesh as a Security Layer**.
- **Sloppy Integrators** and lack of in-house expertise or ongoing testing/pen-testing due to budget constraints.

### Potential Threats
- **Legal Considerations**: Federal and state wiretapping laws may apply. Contact a legal professional.
- **Observing Video Streams** and **Multicast Subscriptions**.
- **Denial of Service Attacks** via flooding, crude jamming, and oversubscription.
- **ARP Spoofing** to become a node or the NVR/DVR.
- **Joining the Mesh Legitimately**: Only 256 "mesh IDs" available.
- **Access to Internal Municipal Networks**.
- **Video Manipulation/Injection** and **UDP Increment Attack**.
- **Non-Video Manipulation**: Infrared tripwires and area sensors to direct police resources or draw attention.

### Privacy Abuse and Misuse
- **Long-Term Archival** and **General Shenanigans** (e.g., Verizon tech, NSA activities).

### Demo
- Demonstrated the vulnerability of WEP encryption.

### Conclusion
- **Thank You!**

This revised version aims to provide a clear, coherent, and professional overview of the presentation.
