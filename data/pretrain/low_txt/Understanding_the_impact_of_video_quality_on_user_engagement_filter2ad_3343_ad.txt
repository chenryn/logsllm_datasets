### LiveH3 and LiveH1 Comparison
LiveH3 exhibits almost identical characteristics to LiveH1; thus, for brevity, we do not present the results for LiveH3. These preliminary results suggest that our observations are also applicable to singular events.

### Impact of Quality Metrics on LiveH1
**Figure 12: Impact of Two Quality Metrics for LiveH1**
- **(a) BufRatio**
- **(b) AvgBitrate**

This figure illustrates the impact of two quality metrics (BufRatio and AvgBitrate) on LiveH1, one of the three final games from the 2010 FIFA World Cup. A linear data fit is shown over the 0-10% subrange of BufRatio. The results for LiveH2 and LiveH3 are nearly identical and are omitted for brevity.

#### Average Bitrate Analysis
- **Play Time Peak**: The play time peaks around a bitrate of 1.2 Mbps.
- **Engagement Decrease**: Beyond 1.2 Mbps, engagement decreases.
- **Reason**: Most end-users (e.g., DSL, cable broadband users) cannot sustain such high bandwidth streams, leading to buffering and midstream bitrate switching. Buffering negatively impacts user experience.

### Correlation Coefficients for SvodA and SvodB
**Table 4: Median Values of Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficients**
- **SvodA**
  - JoinTime: 0.12
  - BufRatio: -0.38
  - RendQual: 0.33
- **SvodB**
  - JoinTime: 0.06
  - BufRatio: -0.53
  - RendQual: 0.34

Note: AvgBitrate and RateBuf are not shown because the player did not switch bitrates and did not gather buffering event data. The results are consistent with SvodA.

### Short VoD Content
For short VoD content, the player uses a discrete set of 2-3 bitrates without switching and was not instrumented to gather buffering event data. Thus, AvgBitrate and RateBuf are not shown. Figure 13 and Table 4 summarize the correlation coefficients for SvodA and SvodB.

#### Key Observations
- **Critical Metrics**: BufRatio and RendQual are the most critical metrics impacting PlayTime.
- **Correlation**: BufRatio and RendQual are strongly correlated.
- **JoinTime**: Weakly correlated.
- **Univariate/Bivariate Information Gain**: Not shown for short VoD as they mirror the correlation analysis results.

### Negative Correlation Between RendQual and PlayTime
**Figure 10: Univariate Gain Distribution for LiveA**
- **BufRatio**: Very low values indicate no network issues, but RendQual drops, yet users continue to watch for a long duration.

**Figure 11: Scatter Plot Between Play Time and Rendering Quality**
- **Observation**: Many points show very low rendering quality but high play time.

**Hypothesis**
- **User Behavior**: Live video viewers often run the video player in the background (e.g., listening to sports commentary).
- **Player Optimization**: The player reduces CPU consumption by decreasing frame rendering rate when the video is in the background.
- **Controlled Experiments**: Confirmed that the player drops RendQual to 20% (rendering 6-7 out of 30 frames per second).

### Case Study with High Impact Events
**LiveH Dataset**
- **Concern**: Whether observations from typical events apply to high-impact events.
- **Key Finding**: Similar trends observed, confirming the applicability of the findings.

### Quantitative Impact of BufRatio
**Figure 14: CDF of Linear-Fit Slopes for BufRatio**
- **Linear Fit**: Applied to the 0-10% range of BufRatio.
- **Slopes**: Median magnitudes are one for long VoD, two for live, and close to zero for short VoD.
- **Impact**: BufRatio has the strongest quantitative impact on live, then long VoD, and least on short VoD.

### Summary of View-Level Analysis
- **Long and Short VoD**: BufRatio is the most important quality metric.
- **Live Content**: AvgBitrate and BufRatio are key metrics.
- **Buffering Events**: Small buffer requirements exacerbate buffering for live videos.
- **Engagement**: A 1% increase in BufRatio can decrease play time by 1 to 3 minutes.
- **JoinTime**: Has significantly lower impact on view-level engagement.
- **RendQual**: Negative correlation in live video highlights the need to consider user and system behavior.

### Viewer-Level Engagement
**Content Providers' Interest**
- **Number of Views**: Analyzed the number of views per viewer and total play time aggregated over all videos watched by the viewer in a one-week interval.
- **Quality Metrics**: Correlated average quality metrics with engagement metrics.

**Figure 15: Impact of JoinTime and BufRatio on Number of Views and Play Time for LvodA**
- **Curious Observation**: Number of views increases in the range 1-15 seconds before decreasing.
- **Speculation**: Users sample content and leave if not interested, while engaged users tolerate longer join times up to a point.

**Figure 16: Viewer-Level Correlations**
- **Consistency**: Qualitative consistency across different datasets.
- **JoinTime**: More pronounced impact at the viewer level compared to the view level.

### Quantitative Results
**Figure 17: Linear Data Fitting for Total Play Time**
- **LvodA and LiveA**: Reducing BufRatio by 1% translates to an effective increase in total play time by 1.2 minutes for long VoD and 2.4 minutes for live content on average per user.

### Discussion
**Lessons Learned**
- **Complementary Analysis**: Multiple views from complementary techniques are valuable in large dataset analysis.
- **Context Importance**: Statistical data mining techniques must be used with caution, considering human and operational factors.

**Example**: Naively acting on the negative correlation between rendering quality and engagement in live content without context could lead to incorrect conclusions. User behavior and player optimizations explain this phenomenon.

### Conclusion
The findings highlight the importance of multiple analysis techniques and contextual understanding in interpreting statistical data, especially in the context of Internet video measurement.
