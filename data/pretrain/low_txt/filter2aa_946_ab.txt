### Possibility of Preserving the Status Quo Pending Appeal

In considering the public interest, it appears that maintaining the current status quo until the appeal is resolved would be favorable. The Court concludes that this factor slightly favors Blizzard; however, it is not sufficient to outweigh the significant questions and the balance of hardships, which support the entry of a stay. Consequently, the Court has decided that the permanent injunction based on the copyright and DMCA violations should be stayed pending the appeal.

### Tortious Interference

The law clearly provides that MDY and Donnelly may be enjoined from engaging in tortious interference. This is supported by several legal precedents, including:

- **Restatement (Second) of Torts § 766, cmt. u**: Equity will act to prevent unjustified interference with contractual relations.
- **Graham v. Mary Kay Inc., 25 W.W.3d 749, 755 (Tex. Ct. App. 2000)**: Injunctive relief is appropriate when a claim of tortious interference is involved.
- **Adler, Barish, Daniels, Levin & Creskoff v. Epstein, 393 A.2d 1175, 436 n.21 (Pa. 1978)**: Equity will act to prevent unjustified interference with contractual relations.
- **Walt Peabody Advertising Serv. v. Pecora, 393 F. Supp. 328, 333 (W.D. Ky. 1975)**: Injunctive relief is appropriate if the loss of a contractual customer to a third party who induces the breach of the contractual relationship constitutes injury.
- **Special Purpose Accounts Receivable Cooperative Corp. v. Prime One Capital Co., 125 F. Supp. 2d 1093, 1106 (S.D. Fla. 2000)**: Injunctive relief is appropriate if the plaintiffs establish tortious interference, otherwise, the plaintiff would be compelled to bring a claim against the defendants each time they interfere with the plaintiffs' protected rights.
- **Transgo, Inc. v. Ajac Transmission Parts Corp., 768 F.2d 1001, 1022 (9th Cir. 1985)**: An injunction may be framed to bar future violations that are likely to occur.

MDY and Donnelly do not dispute that injunctive relief may be entered on the tortious interference claim, nor do they identify serious questions that will be raised by their appeal on this claim. Instead, they argue that serious questions exist regarding the copyright and DMCA claims, and that without these violations, Blizzard could not meet the elements for tortious interference with contract. The Court disagrees with this argument.

To establish tortious interference, Blizzard was required to show:
- A valid contract exists between Blizzard and its customers.
- MDY and Donnelly know of the contract.
- MDY and Donnelly intentionally and improperly interfere with the contract, causing a breach.
- Blizzard is damaged as a result.

MDY and Donnelly conceded most of these elements, including the existence of a valid contract, their knowledge of the contract, and that the use of Glider breaches the contract. They also did not genuinely dispute that they intentionally interfered with the contract by promoting the use of Glider, and that Blizzard is damaged as a result. The key question, then, is whether MDY’s and Donnelly’s actions are improper as a matter of law.

The Court found MDY and Donnelly’s conduct to be improper because:
- They profit from the sale of Glider, knowing that its use constitutes a direct breach of Blizzard’s legitimate and substantial contract rights.
- Their interference causes Blizzard to lose customers and revenue.
- The use of Glider by WoW users upsets the carefully balanced competitive environment of WoW.

Thus, even if MDY and Donnelly have raised serious questions regarding their copyright and DMCA liability, they have not identified such questions on their tortious interference liability. Nor have they made any effort to show that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their appeal of the tortious interference claim.

Since MDY and Donnelly have not shown a probability of success on the merits or that their appeal will raise serious questions concerning the tortious interference claim, they cannot meet the requirements for a stay pending appeal. The Court does not need to address the hardship or public interest aspects of the stay analysis.

### Stay Summary and Injunction Bond

The Court concludes that MDY and Donnelly have established their right to a stay of the permanent injunction regarding the copyright and DMCA claims but not the permanent injunction on the tortious interference claim. The Court recognizes that the separate treatment of these issues is likely to have little practical effect. The permanent injunction on the tortious interference claim will foreclose MDY and Donnelly’s continued marketing, distribution, and support of Glider for use in WoW. For this reason, the Court concludes that Blizzard is not likely to be harmed by the stay of the copyright and DMCA injunction, and no bond is necessary.

### Bond for Stay of Damages

The parties stipulated to a $6,500,000 judgment against MDY and Donnelly on the tortious interference and copyright infringement claims. Pursuant to Rule 62(d), MDY and Donnelly may obtain a stay of that judgment pending appeal by posting a supersedeas bond.

A full bond is generally required under Rule 62(d) to secure the appellees from a loss resulting from the stay of execution. However, in unusual circumstances, the district court may order partially secured or unsecured stays if they do not unduly endanger the judgment creditor’s interest in ultimate recovery. Where the judgment debtor’s present financial condition is such that the posting of a full bond would impose an undue financial burden, the court may fashion some other arrangement for substitute security through an appropriate restraint on the judgment debtor’s financial dealings, which would provide equal protection to the judgment creditor.

MDY and Donnelly cannot post anything close to a full bond amount of $6,500,000 and therefore request an alternative form of security for the stay of the monetary judgment pending appeal. They propose placing all but the necessary funds to operate MDY for fixed overhead and salaries in an escrow account monthly and reporting both monthly income and expenses to Blizzard during the pendency of the appeal. Donnelly also testified at trial that while he has not set aside a separate reserve to satisfy the monetary judgment, he has not spent any profits from the sale of Glider since this litigation began.

The Court concludes that an alternative form of security is appropriate. The appeal will raise serious questions concerning the copyright and DMCA claims, and MDY and Donnelly have shown that their financial condition is so impaired that they would have difficulty securing a supersedeas bond. The Court will require MDY and Donnelly to place all profits obtained from the sale of Glider or other operations of MDY, including all monies set aside by MDY and Donnelly since the commencement of this suit, in an escrow account approved by Blizzard. Such funds shall remain in escrow pending further order of the Court. MDY shall report its monthly income and expenses to Blizzard during the pendency of the appeal. Within 30 days after all appeals being exhausted, the parties shall file a joint status report regarding the appropriate disposition of the escrow funds.
