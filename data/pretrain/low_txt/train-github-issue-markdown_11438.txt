### Environment Details
- **Dubbo Version:** 2.7.7
- **Operating System:** Windows 64-bit
- **Java Version:** 1.8

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue
The `dubboBootstrapApplicationListener` is being registered multiple times within the `ServiceClassPostProcessor`. This listener is already registered as a bean through the following mechanisms:
- `DubboBeanUtils.registerCommonBeans` by `DubboNamespaceHandler`
- `@EnableDubboConfig` annotation
- `@DubboComponentScan` annotation

This repeated registration may cause conflicts or unexpected behavior.
