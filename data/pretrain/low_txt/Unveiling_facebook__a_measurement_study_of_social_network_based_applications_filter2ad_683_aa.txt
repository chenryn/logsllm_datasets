## Abstract
Online social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace have become increasingly popular, with nearly 500 million users as of August 2008. The introduction of the Facebook Developer Platform and OpenSocial has enabled third-party developers to create applications for these platforms, leading to a viral growth in social applications. This growth can potentially influence how content is produced and consumed on the future Internet.

To gain a better understanding, we conducted a large-scale measurement study of the usage characteristics of online social network-based applications. We developed and launched three Facebook applications, which collectively achieved over 8 million subscribers. Using the rich dataset gathered through these applications, we analyzed the aggregate workload characteristics, including temporal and geographical distributions, and the structure of user interactions. Our findings reveal the existence of 'communities' with high internal interaction and limited external interaction. A small fraction of users accounts for the majority of activity within our Facebook applications, and a small number of applications account for the majority of users on Facebook. Additionally, user response times for Facebook applications are independent of the source/destination user locality. We also investigated the distinguishing characteristics of social gaming applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing user activities on online social applications.

## 1. Introduction
Over the past few years, online social networks (OSNs) have attracted a massive following, with nearly 90% of undergraduate students in the United States using one or more social networks regularly [6]. As a result, two OSNs, Facebook and MySpace, are now among the top ten most visited websites on the Internet [26].

OSNs have an inherent viral property, allowing applications' user base to grow exponentially due to the rapid spread of information, much like real-world social networks. Through open developer platforms, large OSNs such as Facebook and MySpace have recently opened their doors to developers worldwide, enabling even amateur developers to create applications by leveraging the underlying social graphs. The introduction of these third-party applications has led to even higher traffic on the corresponding social networks. For example, there was a 30% increase in Facebook’s site traffic in the week following the launch of its developer platform. Given the increasing popularity of these applications, it is important to characterize such social network-based applications as an emerging type of workload.

This paper presents a detailed study of the usage characteristics and the nature of user interactions for three home-grown applications launched using Facebook’s pioneering Developer Platform [14]. We believe this is the first analysis of its kind. The key contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

- **Application Development and Launch:** We developed and launched three applications using the Facebook Developer Platform. These applications have achieved a combined user base of over 8 million users, placing them in the top 1% of Facebook applications at the time of writing. We used these applications to gather a rich dataset on the usage of social network applications, which has been made available to the Internet measurement community [2].
- **Usage Characteristics Analysis:** We analyze various usage characteristics of our applications, such as geographical distribution of users, user interactions, and response times, and how they vary with respect to the application type.
- **User Interaction Modeling:** We use our dataset to infer the nature of user interaction through Facebook applications. We model this interaction through interaction graphs and show that it exhibits small-world properties. One of our key findings is that application dynamics can significantly affect the structure of interaction graphs, thereby weakening the association between them and the underlying real-world (friendship) relationships between users. For example, user interaction graphs for non-gaming applications exhibit stronger community structures compared to gaming applications.
- **Global Usage Data Analysis:** We also analyze global usage data for a broader set of Facebook applications and show that application popularity follows a power-law distribution with exponential decay. We use our findings to provide insights into the underlying mechanisms behind application subscription and usage.

The paper is structured as follows. We begin with a brief overview of related work in Section 2. Section 3 describes our data collection methodology and the design of our applications in detail. We then present high-level characteristics of Facebook applications in Section 4, our findings regarding community structures for our applications in Section 5, and our findings related to user-level behavior for those applications in Section 6. We conclude with a discussion of our results and future work in Section 7.

## 2. Related Work
Over the past few years, there has been a flurry of research on social network analysis. While some researchers have focused on graph-theoretic properties of social networks [7, 9, 10], others have analyzed individual networks' usage patterns [2, 6]. However, there has not been a detailed study of third-party applications developed and launched on OSNs with a massive user base such as Facebook. We believe this paper is the first to measure and characterize this new workload, the user interaction, and its relationship to the underlying social networks.

Facebook has been the focus of several recent studies. A newly published study on the characterization of Facebook applications [5] uses profile crawling to explore the high-level characteristics of application users on Facebook, as well as growth patterns of applications using publicly available usage statistics from Adonomics [16]. We confirm some of the findings of this paper and extend the scope of the study by analyzing activity data from our home-grown applications.

Another important study by Golder et al. [6] on messaging activity inside Facebook highlights Facebook-specific characteristics such as regularities in daily and weekly traffic and its relation to the use of Facebook by a select demographic (college students). The same study found that activity on Facebook seems to be focused on individual 'networks' and is related to temporal usage patterns of those networks. Here, 'networks' refer to Facebook’s classification of users into different networks of school, college, work, and regional categories. We were able to confirm the findings of [6] regarding the periodicity of traffic on Facebook and extend our understanding of traffic patterns and user behavior to third-party Facebook applications.

Other relevant studies include Newman's work on community extraction algorithms [13] and Liben-Nowell's work on the relationship between geography and online friendships [8]. We utilize results from the former and attempt to extend Liben-Nowell’s findings by examining user interaction on social applications and its relation to users' geographical placement.

A recent study by Mislove et al. [10] focused on the graph-theoretic properties of large OSNs such as YouTube [31], Flickr [24], and Orkut [29]. It discussed the existence of small-world and scale-free properties. While we touch upon similar aspects in this study, we focus on a new workload, namely third-party applications on OSNs. In our study, we analyzed actual user interactions through our home-grown applications rather than focusing on the social networks determined through user friendship profiles.

## 3. Background and Methodology
Facebook is a social networking website that has recently gained immense popularity. Part of the reason for Facebook’s success is its developer platform, which we will discuss shortly. A friendship is formed on Facebook when one Facebook user extends a (friendship) invitation to another user. Upon confirmation by the latter, the friendship relationship is formed. Much of the activity on Facebook occurs due to these friendship relationships. However, due to the introduction of the Developer Platform, non-friend interactions are now rising through interaction on social applications. Therefore, it is important to analyze users' interactions through these social applications, beyond the definition of 'friends' through Facebook profiles.

In this section, we provide a brief overview of the Facebook Developer Platform, followed by details of the applications we implemented and a description of the dataset used for our study.

### 3.1 Facebook Developer Platform
The Facebook Developer Platform was launched in May 2007 [14] with little fanfare and only about eight applications in its roster. Over the subsequent months, the Platform experienced phenomenal growth, showcasing more than 35,000 applications by July 2008 [16]. The launch of the Platform also increased Facebook’s traffic by about 30% in the opening week, and it has seen overall growth since [30].

Figure 1 shows aspects of the Facebook Developer Platform’s architecture that are relevant to our applications. In this architecture, a user interacts indirectly with the application servers through Facebook’s API servers. This enables Facebook to protect users from malicious content that may be embedded in the response data by the application servers, as Facebook can process and strip undesirable content from the server responses before forwarding them to users. However, Facebook has an alternate method for deploying applications on its Platform that enables users to interact directly with the application servers. The architecture shown in Figure 1 is the dominant architecture used, primarily due to the ease of displaying content to the application users and the protection of the application servers' identity from the end-users. We adopt this architecture to develop our own Facebook applications to limit the resources required to render content to users.

### 3.2 Implementation of Social Applications
For the purpose of this study, we implemented three Facebook applications: Fighters’ Club, Got Love, and Hugged, which will be discussed below. At the time of writing this paper, these applications had been used by a total of 8.24 million users (7.23 million unique Facebook identities). There are some overlapping users across the three applications. Note that applications on Facebook generally require user subscription (or installation). Once a user installs an application, it may provide updates on users’ and their friends’ activities through the profile page.

#### 3.2.1 Social Gaming: Fighters’ Club (FC)
Fighters’ Club (FC) [23] was launched on June 19, 2007, on the Facebook Developer Platform. It is one of the first games to launch on Facebook and has evolved over a period of 9 months to have been played by over 3.44 million users on Facebook. FC allows users to pick virtual fights with their Facebook friends that last from 15 to 48 hours. During the fight, each player may request support from their Facebook friends, who then help the individual’s team defeat the opposing user’s team through a series of virtual 'hits' decreasing the (limited) strength of the target opponent(s). The team with the higher cumulative strength at the end of the fight is declared the winner.

Users on FC may have one of the following three roles in a given game instance (fight):

- **Offender:** The user instigating the fight is the offender. This user must choose a friend to fight against, provide a reason for picking the fight, and select a fight duration (from 15 to 48 hours).
- **Defender:** The Facebook friend 'picked on' by the offender is the defender.
- **Supporter:** The offender and defender may advertise the fight to their Facebook friends. These friends then pick one side (the offender’s or the defender’s) and support the chosen user’s team. Supporters may withdraw support from fights or change sides until the last 2 hours of the fight.

We decided to make the games last at least 15 hours due to the wide geographical distribution of users possible on social networks and to accommodate users' inability to react instantly when games are formed against them. This delay in reaction is an artifact of OSNs and is discussed later in Section 4.2.3.

#### 3.2.2 Non-Gaming: Got Love (GL)
Got Love (GL) [27] was launched on the Facebook Developer Platform on November 27, 2007, and has been used by a striking 4.07 million users since. The purpose of the application is to enable users to pick a set of 'special' friends they admire in order to display them as a distinct set of 'loved' friends on their user profile page.

#### 3.2.3 Non-Gaming: Hugged
The third application, Hugged [28], was launched on Facebook on January 29, 2008, and has since been used by more than 730,000 users. Like GL, Hugged is also a simple application where users are able to send virtual 'hugs' to their friends. However, unlike GL where a user targets the same friend only once, Hugged allows users to send virtual 'hugs' repeatedly to the same friends.

### 3.3 Data Collection
Most of the data analyzed in this paper is from a 3-week trace, starting March 20, 2008, taken at the respective applications' servers. By recording and time-stamping each user request forwarded by Facebook to our application servers, we were able to trace all activities on FC, GL, and Hugged for the 3-week period. Formally, we define activity as an action performed by a subscribing user on FC, GL, or Hugged on another user. More specifically:

- **On FC:** An activity involves picking a fight with a friend, supporting a fighter in a given fight, and hitting an opponent in a fight. Note that a user may support and hit non-friends.
- **On GL:** An activity occurs when a user A sends 'love' to user B. An individual B may be 'loved' by A only once. In this case, A and B must be Facebook friends.
- **On Hugged:** An activity occurs when a user A sends a virtual 'hug' to a user B. Individual A may send multiple virtual 'hugs' to B. In this case, too, A and B must be Facebook friends.

Table 1 summarizes our dataset from the three applications, along with the following user statistics:

- **Total Unique Users:** Total number of unique Facebook identities that appear in our 3-week long trace.
- **Total Subscribing Users:** Unique Users that had installed our applications on Facebook.
- **Total Active Users:** Subscribing Users that instigated at least one activity on our applications.
- **(Active) Users w/ Geo Info:** Active Users for whom we have geographical information.
- **Users w/ Friendship Data:** Active Users for whom we have friendship data.

| Application | Total Activities | Total Unique Users | Total Subscribing Users | Total Active Users | (Active) Users w/ Geo Info | Users w/ Friendship Data |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Fighters’ Club | 25,911,335 | 154,681 | 85,928 | 43,669 | 40,982 | 35,349 |
| Got Love | 7,196,302 | 5,376,704 | 1,518,767 | 642,088 | 97,465 | 72,074 |
| Hugged | 2,146,819 | 1,322,631 | 408,651 | 198,379 | 180,216 | 121,389 |

However, since we use the indirection-based platform architecture described previously (Section 3.1), we had to separately capture IP addresses of the users to map individual users to different geographical locations. We achieved this by having users' browsers initiate HTTP requests directly to our application servers using FBML IFrames at every visit to the application home page. We were then able to capture users' IP addresses and the respective Facebook user IDs.

To map IP addresses to geographical locations (countries), we used longest-prefix matching with the legacy country zones provided in [18]. We were able to track IP addresses for only a portion of the active users (see Table 1). Moreover, for users who visited our application sites, we tracked the number of their friends and the subset of their friends who also subscribed to our applications (referred to as 'subscribing friends' in the remaining discussions). This is feasible since Facebook provides each user’s friends list data with every request sent to an application server. Note that we gathered IP addresses and friendship data for application users over the period of one week, ending April 1, 2008.

Furthermore, we utilized bandwidth consumption data tracked directly at the application servers, as well as the 'average time spent' metric tracked through Google Analytics [17] for each application. We also acquired daily unique usage activity data for the top 200 applications on Facebook (as of April 22, 2008) from Developer Analytics [19] for the period starting January 29, 2008, and ending April 22, 2008. However, many applications' statistics were missing for days in between. For the analysis in the next section, we selected 160 out of the 200 applications that have clean data for a total of 79 days.

## 4. High-Level Characteristics

### 4.1 Global Facebook Application Statistics
We use the top applications' data from Developer Analytics to study the daily volume of users that use a particular application. We define the Daily Active Usage (DAU) as the number of unique users that visit the application at least once during a given day. Figure 2 plots the mean DAU for the entire set of the top 160 applications that we selected. The dotted vertical lines delineate weekends over the 79-day period. We see a consistent pattern showing that Facebook applications attract a relatively smaller number of unique users on weekends compared to weekdays. Our data also shows that application usage generally peaks on Tuesdays.

To show the relative popularity of our three applications (FC, GL, and Hugged), we rank the 160 applications in our dataset in decreasing order of their DAU over the 79-day measurement period. We divide the 160 applications into 4 tiers by DAU and plot the mean DAU for each quartile. Figure 2 shows that the DAU of our three applications is comparable to the mean DAU for the bottom two quartiles of applications (divided DAU-wise). Since Facebook hosts more than 35,000 applications [16], this shows that our applications are comfortably placed within the top 1% of all applications.

We also looked at the distribution of DAU across our set of the 160 top applications. Figure 3 plots the fraction of the sum of DAU values averaged over the 79-day period that is accounted for by the top x percent of the applications. The Pareto principle or the 80-20 rule is evident in that 20% of the most popular applications account for approximately 69% of the daily active users. Figure 4 compares the distribution of average DAU across the 160 top applications in greater detail against the best-fit power-law and exponential curves. It suggests that application popularity follows a power-law distribution with an exponential cutoff, which is characterized by an exponential decay term that dominates the power-law behavior after a certain threshold. [2] showed the popularity distribution of user-generated video content on YouTube, and our findings are consistent with this.

[Figures 2, 3, and 4 would be included here to illustrate the data and trends discussed.]

## 5. Community Structures
In this section, we analyze the community structures within our applications. We use interaction graphs to model the interactions between users and identify communities with high internal interaction and limited external interaction. Our findings reveal that non-gaming applications exhibit stronger community structures compared to gaming applications. This suggests that the nature of the application can significantly influence the structure of user interactions.

## 6. User-Level Behavior
We also investigate the user-level behavior within our applications. We analyze the temporal and geographical distributions of user activities and find that a small fraction of users accounts for the majority of activity. Additionally, user response times for Facebook applications are independent of the source/destination user locality. These findings provide insights into the dynamics of user engagement and the factors that influence it.

## 7. Conclusion and Future Work
In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the usage characteristics and user interactions within Facebook applications. We developed and launched three applications, which collectively achieved over 8 million subscribers, and used the rich dataset gathered to analyze various aspects of user behavior. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding the nature of user interactions and the role of application dynamics in shaping these interactions.

Future work could include a more detailed analysis of the factors that drive user engagement and the long-term impact of social applications on user behavior. Additionally, further research could explore the implications of these findings for the design and development of future social applications.
