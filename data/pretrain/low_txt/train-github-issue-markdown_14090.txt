This week, Chrome announced its plans to release WebGL 2.0, which signals that it's the right time for us to start adding support for it.

While there are already some pull requests (PRs) that introduce support for some of the new features in `WebGLRenderer`, it didn't seem like a good idea to make `WebGLRenderer` compatible with both `webgl` and `webgl2`. 

To address this, we are introducing `WebGL2Renderer`! (Commit: 2ff9d41) ðŸ™Œ This new renderer will not only help us avoid numerous conditional statements but also provide an opportunity to clean up our codebase. We will begin by supporting only `BufferGeometry`.

I apologize to those whose PRs were not merged due to my indecision. I appreciate your contributions and patience. ðŸ˜”
