**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Application Access Token

Adversaries may exploit stolen application access tokens to circumvent the standard authentication process, thereby gaining unauthorized access to restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems. These tokens, often obtained through the compromise of user or service credentials, can be used in place of traditional login credentials to authenticate and perform actions as if they were the legitimate user or service.
