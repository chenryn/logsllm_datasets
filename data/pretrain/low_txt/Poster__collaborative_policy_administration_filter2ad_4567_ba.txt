### Fundamental Belief in the Value of Good Design

At the core of every Designmatters project at Art Center College of Design is the fundamental belief that good design brings value to society, with the potential for especially transformative impact in the context of "wicked" problems and entrenched social inequities. The Teen Art Park project exemplifies this belief, providing a significant case study. The collaborative framework it offers embodies bottom-up social innovation, as defined by the DESIS Collaborative and Public Sector cluster, and serves as a platform to "trigger, enable, and support active collaborative behavior on the part of citizens."

As one of the design teams articulated, the Teen Art Park project is envisioned "to be a place for transformation, where you could become the best version of who you can possibly be." This aspiration and unwavering commitment to collaboration continue to drive the project forward, serving some of the most vulnerable and promising youth in the community.

### Implications for Design Practice, Education, and Policymaking

#### Design Practice
Design for Social Sustainability is a framework for creating thriving new communities. Current tools and metrics for urban development are often biased toward environmental and economic sustainability. The Teen Art Park Project exemplifies an effort to achieve the social sustainability called for by the Young Foundation’s Future Communities program.

#### Design Education
Incorporating participatory design research and co-design into the curriculum is essential for community design initiatives that aim to add value to the community. Active listening, fostering a two-way learning process with and from users, and establishing trust among partners are paramount goals of engaged social impact design education.

#### Policymaking
Successful and socially sustainable communities require mechanisms and policies that allow residents to shape their own physical surroundings. Planning, designing, and developing such communities necessitate these supportive frameworks.

### Collaborative Design Strategies: Helping to Change the Practice of Care

**Authors:** Kristin Hughes, Peter Scupelli

**Abstract:**
Over the past four decades, the number of obese children in the U.S. has increased dramatically. Despite this, physicians still find it challenging to address issues of weight and health with young patients and their families during annual well-child check-ups. Physicians have few resources to help them overcome barriers such as time constraints, perceived ineffectiveness, and uncomfortable confrontation. Using a design-led approach, we help physicians facilitate conversations around obesity prevention. This highly participatory and transparent approach educates and motivates physicians to change their perceptions of effective ways to deliver health education. This process informed the design of a product and service known as Fitwits MD. Our paper argues that scaffolds are necessary for determining the sustainability and evolution of a product or service. Illustrated examples show the efforts of physicians who initiated and co-designed new products, services, and policies to improve their own lives and those of their patients. We describe the design process, dissemination, and evaluation linked to the making and development of Fitwits MD.

**Introduction:**
Obesity is an escalating problem in the United States. In the last quarter century, the prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents has tripled. Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control (Ogden and Carroll 2012) estimates that 17% of children and adolescents are obese, and 33% of children aged 6-11 years are overweight or obese. Many physicians feel unprepared due to a lack of training and the absence of an effective strategy to discuss child obesity prevention and improvement (Perrin et al. 2005). In a 2005 Ambulatory Pediatrics article, only 12% of pediatricians providing routine office care felt high self-efficacy in counseling about childhood obesity; 39% felt they could be effective with improved training and tools. Physicians also feel pressed for time during well-child visits. Physician organizations and national agencies stress the importance of better health messaging, annual body mass index (BMI) assessment, and related counseling during well-child visits. However, a minority of family physicians and pediatricians feel prepared to provide this counseling. Physicians and health educators alike are looking for evidence-based educational programs to assist in broaching the subject of obesity with their patients (McGaffey et al. 2011). As noted by a local pediatrician, “A pediatrician’s number one clinical dilemma is how to counsel families about preventing and managing childhood obesity.” In fact, it is a dilemma for all who provide routine childcare (McGaffey et al. 2011).

**What is Fitwits?**
Fitwits advocates for improved health education and resources in all facets of individuals’ lives and has been designed to reduce counseling barriers, educate, and stimulate conversations between children, parents, teachers, and healthcare providers. Fitwits is a system of games, educational products, and services that enable kids and their families to adopt and maintain healthier lifestyles. At the heart of the brand are novel cartoon characters called the Fitwits and Nitwits. The Fitwits epitomize healthy foods and model good lifestyle choices, like physical activities. The Nitwits typify unhealthy food choices and the struggle to make better health decisions. The novelty of Fitwits makes teaching and learning about health fun. It is designed to create interesting hybrid experiences merging technology with hands-on learning, allowing people of all ages to interact, ask questions, make decisions, and "try on" new health behaviors. The Fitwits Program grew out of concern for the lack of available health-related resources used to encourage positive lifestyle changes.

In this paper, we describe one aspect of the Fitwits Program in which designers worked with family medicine, pediatric care physicians, dietitians, and their patients to design an effective tool to be used during well-child visits with 9-12-year-old patients and families. During the early stages of our initial investigation, we learned that preventative care for obesity-related illness has been known to increase patient health literacy (Hughes et al. 2009). Health literacy is often narrowly defined as a method of dissemination for use when making health decisions (Peerson and Saunders 2009), but recent health experts have observed a greater effectiveness of health communications' potential positive impact when people directly interact with and use the messages to change or take action to improve their health.

**Participating in the Design Process:**
When asked, “What are the boundaries of design?” Charles Eames replied, “What are the boundaries of problems?” (Eames et al. 1989). The general boundaries of obesity prevention described in this paper include health literacy, co-creation, and adaptable co-design practices. The particular boundaries are tied to the context and the actors involved in obesity prevention. A collaborative and transparent design process allows the community of use to not only be part of the initial discussion and emergence of the design but also to take ownership of the process and resulting design solutions and to adapt over time as needed.

**Defining Co-Creation:**
Co-creation happens when designers and non-designers are engaged and encouraged to participate in the design process. The role of the design team in a co-creation process is to create hands-on design activities that encourage participation and open engagement in a workshop-like setting. The design activities are ordered to:
- Offer authorship opportunities
- Build trust between the participants and the design team
- Acquire local knowledge and skills
- Iterate and refine the problem definition
- Learn about local community values, culture, and practice
- Allow the designer to enter the problem space without a pre-determined outcome

Co-creation is challenging because both designers and, in our case, medical professionals are called to work outside their area of expertise. Designers must acquire medical domain knowledge (e.g., related medical research, clinical practice) while physicians are asked to participate in conceiving, making, and prototyping future products and/or services, iteratively beta testing them, and then integrating varied prototypes into their practice. Specific to our process, it was highly beneficial that physician staff participated in design workshops. Without their expertise, challenges specific to a medical educational program, such as a physician-training program, would have been difficult to ascertain. The task for the design team was to work alongside healthcare practitioners to articulate the difficulties they encounter in their practices and construct a framework for communicating the essentials of obesity prevention both visually and in simple language.

To reach this stage, we needed to better understand what and for whom we were designing. We ran several participatory design workshops during which we helped lead participants through activities aimed at identifying misused and confusing health terminology, illuminating barriers that prevent open discussions about obesity with families, pinpointing issues they believed were most important to convey to patients, and discussing the types of physical aids that might help them during such interventions. Participants included faculty, a social worker, and a librarian from a family medicine residency program, family and pediatric physicians who provide routine childcare in Pittsburgh communities, registered dietitians, a faculty member from a research university, and four design students.

**Description of Design Research Activities and Synthesis:**
Our first activity identified barriers to discussing weight, nutrition, and exercise with patients. Participants were provided with sticky notes identifying many possible barriers to in-office counseling. Results showed that the two most important barriers are 1) time constraints and 2) the fact that many patients are unwilling to change. Other barriers included patient issues (low educational level, denial, lack of interest, and perceived benefits of obesity), provider issues (lack of time, lack of training or knowledge), and community factors (high cost of healthy food, limited access to healthy foods, lack of role models).

We then asked participants to help write definitions for nine health-related terms. The word lists included a wide range of definitions, euphemisms for potentially offensive words, and misused terms. Participants provided a surprisingly large range of answers for most of the terms and seemed to have varying degrees of understanding about many of the terms and reasons for why they would use, for example, the word "overweight" versus the word "obese." Many doctors defined "obesity" and "weight problem" using a Body Mass Index (BMI) classification. Some explained that they prefer to use the terms "overweight" or "weight problem" with children to avoid "obesity," which they deemed an offensive term; one even shied away from saying "problem." The most important terms were also the hardest to define and describe, again pointing to a communication breakdown between physicians and patients during health education discussions. Clinical expertise did not translate into the ability to consistently and simply impart knowledge to patients.

Participants were then split into "doctor-patient" pairs to role-play an encounter between a 9-to-12-year-old attending a well-child check-up and his/her doctor. Prior to the workshop, the design team developed two, three-minute scenarios. In the first, doctors received cue cards to help prompt questions regarding health and nutrition. In the second, we provided a "physician tool" to the doctor roles. After each scenario, roles were reversed, and participants switched partners. We ran each scenario twice. Many doctors made little progress in the allotted time, often starting slowly and awkwardly by asking patients about favorite things they like to do at school and making light conversation. Participants were engaged but had trouble speaking confidently about obesity, continually reverting back to confusing "doctor speak." Participants noted that this activity was a good opportunity for them to practice under a time constraint, a major barrier identified earlier. And, although not planned, what emerged in our discussions with workshop participants was the need to look at the larger systems that would ensure our product would be used. It was clear that intra- and inter-office leadership and coordination are necessary to ensure participation, understanding, and use.

**Participant Reflections:**
Several months after the workshops, the design team asked participants to reflect on the following topics: 1) their perceived agency over co-created health communications, 2) the role of physicians as designers, and 3) the effectiveness of a "training the trainer" method. One physician noted how her perspective of design changed through her experience of the participatory design process.
