### Part 78: Our Focus (1)
Supporting web processes on a multi-enterprise and web scale requires addressing challenges such as heterogeneity, integration, scalability, dynamic change, and performance. Semantics is seen as the key enabler to tackle these issues. Semantic Web Processes build upon Web Services and Semantic Web technologies. This tutorial part focuses on adding semantics to Web Services and leveraging them in the Web Process Lifecycle, including specification, discovery, composition, and execution.

- **Functional Perspective**: Involves process composition, Web Service Discovery, and handling semantic heterogeneity (modeling data I/O, state (pre/post conditions), and function).
- **Operational Perspective**: Involves research on QoS specification for Web Services and processes (modeling QoS and execution behavior).

### Part 80: The Basics
- **What are Web Services, Web Processes, and Semantics?**

### Part 81: Web Services: Definition
"Web services are self-contained, self-describing, modular applications that can be published, located, and invoked across the Web. They perform functions ranging from simple requests to complex business processes. Once a Web service is deployed, other applications (and other Web services) can discover and invoke the deployed service." - IBM Web Service Tutorial

### Part 82: Why Web Services?
Web services offer a standardized way to integrate different systems and applications. They use protocols like SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI, and can be compared to other technologies such as Jini, Enterprise Java Beans, RMI, Microsoft DCOM, CORBA, and others. The key advantage is their ability to work over the internet, enabling interoperability and flexibility.

### Part 83: Web Process Example
An example of a web process involving multiple organizations:
- **Organization A** performs setup.
- **Organization B** tests quality.
- **Organization C** processes sequences and generates reports.

### Part 84: What are Web Processes (1)?
Web Processes are next-generation workflow technologies that facilitate interactions between organizations, markets, competitors, suppliers, and customers. They support enterprise-level and core business activities and encompass both intra- and inter-organizational workflows. Web processes are created by composing Web services and can be represented using BPEL4WS, but the challenge lies in how to achieve this composition.

### Part 85: What are Web Processes (2)?
Web processes describe how Web services are connected to create reliable and dependable business solutions. They allow businesses to define sophisticated processes that can both consume and provide Web services. The role of Web processes within an enterprise is to simplify the integration of business and application processes across technological and corporate domains.

### Part 86: Web Process Example
A graphical example of a web process, such as the BarnesBookPurchase process, which involves various steps and interactions.

### Part 87: Web Processes Composition
Web processes are composed of multiple Web services, each performing a specific task. An example of a web process design shows the interaction and composition of several Web services.

### Part 88: Globalization of Processes
Web processes drive the networked economy by enabling B2B e-services, distributed workflows, and global processes. They span from enterprise-level to inter-enterprise and global scales.

### Part 89: Big Challenges
- **Heterogeneity and Autonomy**: Syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic differences, along with complex rules and regulations.
- **Dynamic Nature of Business Interactions**: Requires efficient discovery, composition, and scalability.
- **Scalability**: From enterprises to the web scale.
- **Solution**: Machine-processable descriptions and semantics.

### Part 90: Semantics, Ontologies, and Semantic Web Processes
When Web services and other descriptions that define a Web process are semantically described, they form Semantic Web Processes. An ontology provides a vocabulary and meaning, enabling an agreed-upon structure for exchanging information in a domain.

### Part 91: Broad Scope of Semantic (Web) Technology
The scope of semantic technology ranges from informal to formal, with varying degrees of agreement and interoperability. It includes ontologies, thesauri, and various representation methods.

### Part 92: Representation and Ontologies
Different types of ontologies, such as TAMBIS, KEGG, BioPAX, and others, are used to represent and organize knowledge. These ontologies vary in complexity and expressiveness.

### Part 93: Using WordNet
WordNet is a lexical database that organizes English words into synonym sets, representing underlying lexical concepts. It models the lexical organization used by humans, providing a thesaurus rather than a dictionary.

### Part 94-95: Using WordNet (Examples)
- **Sense 1 of "eagle"**: Any of various large keen-sighted diurnal birds of prey.
- **Sense 2 of "eagle"**: A score of two strokes under par on a golf hole.

### Part 97: Semantics for Web Processes
- **Data/Information Semantics**: Formal definition of data in input and output messages for discovery and interoperability.
- **Functional/Operational Semantics**: Representing capabilities of Web services for discovery and composition.
- **Execution Semantics**: Representing the flow of services for analysis, validation, and execution.
- **QoS Semantics**: Describing operational metrics for selecting suitable services.

### Part 98-105: Semantics for Web Process Lifecycle
- **Development and Execution**: Includes description, annotation, and orchestration.
- **Publication and Discovery**: Enabling scalable and efficient publication and discovery.
- **Flow Layer**: Design, analysis, validation, and execution of processes.

### Part 106-110: Semantics at Different Layers
- **Description Layer**: Unambiguously understanding the functionality and operational data using ontologies.
- **Publication and Discovery Layers**: Enabling scalable and dynamic publication and discovery.
- **Flow Layer**: Design, analysis, validation, and execution of processes.
