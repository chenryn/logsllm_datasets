## Abstract
This paper presents the first comprehensive study of network access link performance measured directly from home gateway devices. Policymakers, ISPs, and users are increasingly interested in understanding the performance of Internet access links. However, many confounding factors in home networks or on end hosts make it challenging to thoroughly analyze access network performance without deploying measurement infrastructure in users' homes.

In collaboration with the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) study of broadband Internet access in the United States, we conducted longitudinal measurements from nearly 4,000 gateway devices across 8 ISPs, out of a total deployment of over 4,200 devices. Our study examines the throughput and latency of network access links, and how various factors, such as the user's choice of modem and the ISP's traffic shaping policies, can affect performance.

Our findings provide important insights into the characteristics of existing access networks and offer guidance on how access network performance should be measured and presented to users. These insights can inform broader efforts to benchmark the performance of access networks.

## 1. Introduction
With nearly two billion Internet users worldwide, approximately 500 million are residential broadband subscribers. As broadband penetration increases, people rely more on home connectivity for daily and critical activities. The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) is actively developing performance-testing metrics for access providers. Policymakers, home users, and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are seeking better ways to benchmark home broadband Internet performance.

Benchmarking home Internet performance is not as simple as running one-time "speed tests." While numerous tools exist to measure Internet performance, previous studies have typically run one-time measurements either from an end-host inside the home or from a server on the wide-area Internet. These methods cannot account for confounding factors such as home network cross-traffic, wireless network issues, or end-host configuration. Additionally, one-time measurements do not provide a baseline performance level or observe how performance varies over time.

This paper measures and characterizes broadband Internet performance from home gateways, which connect the home network to the user's modem. This vantage point allows us to control for many confounding factors, such as the home wireless network and load on the measurement host. Deploying gateways in many homes is difficult and expensive, but we were able to leverage the ongoing FCC broadband study to achieve this unique deployment.

We perform our measurements using two complementary deployments: a large FCC-sponsored study by SamKnows, which has installed gateways in over 4,200 homes across the United States, and BISMark, deployed in 16 homes across three ISPs in Atlanta. Both deployments run a comprehensive suite of measurement tools that periodically measure throughput, latency, packet loss, and jitter.

We characterize access network throughput and latency from the SamKnows and BISMark deployments. We explain how our throughput measurements differ from common "speed tests" and propose several different latency metrics. When our measurements cannot fully explain observed behavior, we model the access link and verify our hypotheses using controlled experiments. We find that the most significant sources of throughput variability are the access technology, ISPs' traffic shaping policies, and congestion during peak hours. Latency is mostly affected by the quality of the access link, modem buffering, and cross-traffic within the home.

This study offers insights into both access network performance and appropriate measurement methods for benchmarking home broadband performance. Our key lessons include:
- ISPs use different policies and traffic shaping behaviors, making it difficult to compare measurements across ISPs.
- There is no "best" ISP for all users; different users may prefer different ISPs based on their usage profiles and performance dimensions.
- Home network equipment and infrastructure can significantly affect performance.

As the first in-depth analysis of home access network performance, our study provides valuable insights for users, ISPs, and policymakers. Users and ISPs can better understand the performance of the access link, and our results can serve as a foundation for benchmarking efforts.

## 2. Related Work
Previous work has characterized access networks using passive traffic measurements from DSL provider networks in Japan, France, and Europe. These studies focus on traffic patterns and application usage but also infer round-trip time and throughput. Without active measurements or a vantage point within the home network, it is not possible to measure the actual performance that users receive from their ISPs, as user traffic does not always saturate the access network connection.

Other studies have characterized access network performance by probing access links from servers in the wide area. Active probing from a fixed set of servers can characterize many access links, but measurements may be inaccurate or inconsistent due to the distance between the server and the access network. Isolating the performance of the access network from the end-to-end path can be challenging, and dynamic IP addressing complicates repeated measurements.

The Grenouille project in France measures the performance of access links using a monitoring agent that runs from a user’s machine inside the home network. Neti@Home and BSense also use this approach, although with fewer users. PeerMetric measured P2P performance from about 25 end hosts. Installing software at the end-host measures the access network from the user’s perspective and can gather continuous measurements. Han et al. measured access network performance from a laptop that searched for open wireless networks, but this approach does not scale and offers no insights into the specifics of the home network configuration.

Other studies have performed "one-time" measurements of access-link performance, helping users troubleshoot by asking them to run tests from a website. Netalyzr, Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT), and Network Path and Application Diagnostics (NPAD) send active probes to detect client performance issues. Glasnost performs active measurements to determine whether the user’s ISP is blocking BitTorrent traffic. These tools are typically run once, so they cannot capture a longitudinal view of any single access link. None of these studies measure the access link directly from the home network gateway.

## 3. Access Networks: Background
We describe the two most common access technologies: Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and cable. We also explain how a user’s choice of service plan and local configuration can affect performance. Although some users in our deployments have fiber-to-the-node (FTTN), fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP), and WiMax, we do not have enough users to analyze these technologies.

### DSL Networks
DSL networks use telephone lines, with subscribers having dedicated lines between their DSL modems and the closest DSL Access Multiplexer (DSLAM). The DSLAM multiplexes data between the access modems and upstream networks. The most common type of DSL access is asymmetric (ADSL), which provides different upload and download rates.

#### ADSL Capacity
The ITU-T standardization body specifies that the achievable rate for ADSL 1 is 12 Mbps downstream and 1.8 Mbps upstream. The ADSL2+ specification extends the capacity to up to 24 Mbps download and 3.5 Mbps upload. The actual capacity depends on the quality of the local loop, which is influenced by the distance to the DSLAM and line noise. The maximum IP link capacity is lower than the sync rate due to protocol overhead. The best service plan usually represents the rate customers can achieve with a good connection to the DSLAM. Providers also offer lower-rate plans and can rate-limit customer traffic at the DSLAM.

Modem configuration can affect performance. ADSL users or providers configure their modems to operate in either fastpath or interleaved mode. Fastpath minimizes latency but prevents error correction, while interleaving increases robustness to line noise at the cost of increased latency.

### Cable Networks
Cable networks use shared media (typically coaxial cable) to transmit data. At a regional headend, a Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) receives signals and converts them to Ethernet. The physical connection between a customer’s home and the CMTS is often referred to as the local loop or last mile.

#### Cable Capacity
The most widely deployed version of the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) is DOCSIS 2.0, which specifies download rates up to 42.88 Mbps and upload rates up to 30.72 Mbps in the United States. DOCSIS 3.0 allows for hundreds of megabits per second by bundling multiple channels. Cable providers often offer service plans with lower rates, implemented using a token bucket rate shaper. Many cable providers offer PowerBoost, which temporarily increases download speeds.
