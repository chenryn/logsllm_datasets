Today, we encountered a serious issue that resulted in the termination of all our pods. This was due to an AWS EC2 service disruption in the Ireland region, which began at 6:00 AM PDT. 

During this disruption, the kubelet was unable to list EC2 instances for approximately 40 seconds, which is the `node-monitor-grace-period`. After this period, the kubelet reached the maximum node status retry count and initiated the termination of all pods.

Here are some relevant log entries:
- 12:44:22: `kubelet.go:1933` - Error updating node status, will retry: failed to get node address from cloud provider: error listing AWS instances: Unavailable: The service is unavailable. Please try again shortly. (status code: 503, request id: [])
- 12:45:04: `kubelet.go:839` - Unable to update node status: update node status exceeds retry count
- 12:45:10: `kubelet.go:1518` - Killing unwanted pod "swagger-extcs"
- 12:45:10: `manager.go:1123` - Killing container with id "aa4a55984..."
- 12:45:10: `manager.go:1123` - Killing container with id "9bdb1788e..."
- 12:45:10: `kubelet.go:1343` - Orphaned volume "5796b5eb..." found, tearing down volume

One potential solution could be to increase the `node-monitor-grace-period` and `pod-eviction-timeout` in the kube-controller-manager, assuming that AWS downtimes will not exceed a certain duration `t`. However, this approach is risky because it relies solely on the cloud provider to determine the health of the nodes. A non-responsive cloud provider does not necessarily mean the platform is entirely unhealthy.

Today, we learned this lesson the hard way when our entire production cluster went down, even though the instances themselves were functioning correctly.
