Subject: Issue with Navbar Links in Version 3.0 RC1 on Firefox

Hello,

I am currently testing version 3.0 RC1 and have encountered an issue while building my website with this version.

The problem I am facing is that the links in the navigation bar are not working as expected when using the Firefox browser. Specifically, the links appear to be disabled.

Could you please look into this matter and provide any available solutions or workarounds?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
Lefandordinateur
