To find more information about Alexander Taylor, we check his LinkedIn profile and discover that he attended the University of South Florida. We then look up the computer club associated with this university and find that its URL starts with `wcsc`.

Next, we navigate to `http://fuzyll.com/csaw2015/wcsc` and receive another clue:
`CSAW 2015 FUZYLL RECON PART 2 OF ?: TmljZSB3b3JrISBUaGUgbmV4dCBwYXJ0IGlzIGF0IC9jc2F3MjAxNS88bXkgc3VwZXIgc21hc2ggYnJvdGhlcnMgbWFpbj4uCg==`

var s = "THIS IS THE INPUT"
var c = ""
for (i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    c += String.fromCharCode((s[i]).charCodeAt(0) ^ 0x4);
}
console.log(c);`

The provided code is a simple XOR encryption with a static key. Applying the same operation to decode the message, we get: `they_see_me_rollin`. We then navigate to:
