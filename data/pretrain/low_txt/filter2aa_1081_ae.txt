### OCZ Agility 3, 60GB
- **Controller:** SandForce SF-2281
- **Capacity:** Half the usable flash memory compared to the Patriot drive
- **Purpose:** To test consistent behavior across different manufacturers using the same controller
- **Note:** The drive failed during timed deletion tests and was not used for several final experiments.
- **Info Screenshot:** Not available due to drive failure

### SuperTalent MasterDrive, 64GB
- **Unique Feature:** PATA flash drive with a SATA-to-PATA bridge chip
- **Generation:** One of the earliest generations of SSDs

## Forensic Lab Configuration

The forensic lab setup included two separate computers:
1. **Evidence Creation Machine:**
   - **Hardware:** Dell Latitude E6500 laptop
   - **Operating System:** Windows 7 Professional 64-bit (majority of tests), Windows XP 32-bit (small sampling)
   - **Interfaces:** eSATA and USB
   - **Purpose:** Direct interaction with the drive's controller for native ATA commands like TRIM
   - **Isolation:** Drive being tested was independent of the boot drive to limit write and access activity

2. **Data Acquisition Machine:**
   - **Hardware:** HP DC7700 desktop
   - **Operating System:** Caine 2.0 forensic distribution (Ubuntu 12.04 based)
   - **Tools:**
     - Diskology Disk Jockey Pro Forensic write-blocker
     - Guymager for image creation/acquisition
     - Selective File Dumper (SFDUMPER) for file recovery and carving
     - Linux tar binary for image compression
   - **Storage:** External 3TB USB hard drive for long-term storage

## Experiments

### Test 1, Part 1: Text File Deletion
- **Procedure:**
  - Drives formatted to full capacity and connected via eSATA
  - Single text file created with "Test File" content
  - File copied, unmounted, re-mounted, and deleted
  - Drive imaged and investigated for recoverability
- **Results:**
  - Text file was recoverable on all drives

### Test 1, Part 2: Text File Deletion – Quick Format
- **Procedure:**
  - Quick format performed via eSATA
  - Drives imaged and checked for recoverability using the Unix "strings" command
- **Results:**
  - Text string was recoverable from the control hard drive and the Patriot SSD
  - Other SSDs did not contain the text string

### Test 2
- **Note:** Omitted due to numbering error. All tests are referenced by their original numbers.

### Test 3, Part 1: Single JPG File
- **Procedure:**
  - Single JPG file saved to each drive via eSATA
  - TRIM command enabled (Windows 7 default)
  - File copied, unmounted, re-mounted, and deleted
  - Drive imaged and investigated for recoverability
- **Results:**
  - Recoverable on the control hard drive
  - Not recoverable on Crucial and Intel SSDs
  - Partially recoverable on Samsung SSD
  - Recoverable with file carving on SuperTalent SSD

### Test 3, Part 2: Single JPG File – Quick Format
- **Procedure:**
  - Quick format performed via eSATA
  - Drives imaged and checked for recoverability using file carving
- **Results:**
  - Quick format did not change the results of Part 1

### Test 4, Part 1: Single JPG File, TRIM Disabled
- **Procedure:**
  - Single JPG file saved to each drive via eSATA
  - TRIM command disabled in the operating system
  - File copied, unmounted, re-mounted, and deleted
  - Drive imaged and investigated for recoverability
- **Results:**
  - [To be filled in with specific results]
