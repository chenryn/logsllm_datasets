### Reasonable Performance Even in Crowded Spaces

To study the worst-case scenarios for SDDR, we estimate the reduction in battery life, assuming 255 new device responses for every inquiry scan. Our energy consumption estimate consists of three components: idle with Bluetooth running in discoverable mode (EBT), epoch changes (EEC), and discoveries (ED). Each component represents the energy consumed in millijoules (mJ) over a full day (24 hours). The total energy consumption while running the SDDR protocol is given by:

\[ E_{\text{SDDR}}(d, i) = E_{\text{BT}}(d, i) + E_{\text{EC}} + E_{\text{D}}(d, i) \]

where:
- \( E_{\text{BT}}(d, i) \) and \( E_{\text{D}}(d, i) \) vary with the number of nearby devices (d) and the discovery interval in seconds (i).
- \( E_{\text{EC}} \) does not vary with d or i.

We measured the average energy consumption for 1, 3, and 5 discovering devices, with discovery intervals of 60 and 120 seconds. We used microbenchmark results from Table 2 to provide formulas for the energy consumed by epoch changes and discoveries. We assume a linear model for \( E_{\text{BT}}(d, i) \) and \( E_{\text{D}}(d, i) \) with respect to the number of nearby devices (d) for each i (either 60 or 120 seconds).

### Validation of Energy Consumption Model

Equation 1 was validated by comparing its results with the measured values from Table 3. Without any nearby devices, our estimates were off by 1.96% and 0.66% for 60 and 120-second discovery intervals, respectively. For the case of 5 devices, our estimates deviated from the measurement results by 4.61% and 1.74%.

Figure 4 shows the estimated daily battery life consumption for varying numbers of nearby devices. In the worst-case scenario, running the SDDR protocol with a 120-second discovery interval consumes 27.82% of the battery life over an entire day.

### Comparison with SmokeScreen

We compared the performance of our protocol with SmokeScreen's discovery protocol [27]. SmokeScreen requires sending one clique signal per advertised ID and does not use a set-digest data structure (e.g., Bloom filter) to aggregate them. In the authors' implementation, clique signals are sent over a Bluetooth name request, which holds 248 bytes of data, i.e., roughly 4 clique signals. This makes SmokeScreen less scalable for larger advertised sets:
1. For more than 4 advertised IDs, multiple Bluetooth name requests are needed, increasing discovery latency.
2. Sending multiple name requests for large advertised sets also leads to additional energy consumption.

SDDR, on the other hand, requires a constant amount of time to detect linkability to a given false positive rate, while SmokeScreen's detection time increases linearly with the number of clique signals.

Since the SmokeScreen measurements were reported several years ago, we re-evaluated the energy consumption on a recent device. Our conservative estimate, considering only communication-related energy overhead, suggests that in the case of one nearby device, SmokeScreen’s communication consumes 1,628 mJ of energy; for three devices, this increases to 2,071 mJ. The cost of performing a name request for each individual nearby device is prohibitively expensive. For the same amount of energy spent by SmokeScreen with 3 nearby devices, SDDR can discover and process 35 nearby devices (from Equation 1).

### Discussion

In this section, we discuss the properties and implications of the unique communication model provided by SDDR, which departs from the norm in two basic ways:
1. **Confidentiality without Identity**: Encounter peers can communicate securely even though they do not know each other and cannot recognize each other during future encounters.
2. **Radio-Range Limited Communication**: Communication within SDDR is defined and limited by radio range, which may not necessarily conform to application semantics.

#### Confidentiality without Identity

SDDR's secure encounter primitive provides a per-encounter mutual pseudonym for the encounter peers and an associated shared key. This enables the peers to name each other and communicate securely during their encounter and at any time after via an untrusted rendezvous service. The peers can name and authenticate each other as participants in a specific encounter while remaining anonymous and unlinkable otherwise (assuming they do not reveal linkable information within their communication).

Interestingly, if the users choose, this type of anonymous interaction during an encounter can form the basis for mutual identification and authentication. Prior systems, such as SMILE [43] and SmokeScreen [27], rely on anonymous or unlinkable encounters between peers.

#### Radio-Range Limited Communication

SDDR communication is limited to radio range, nominally 10 meters for Bluetooth 2.1 (50 meters for the latest Bluetooth 4.0 standard). From an application design perspective, range-limited communication may inhibit but can also prove useful.

Without a third-party data repository or additional protocol mechanisms, applications that provide notifications among devices beyond radio range cannot be implemented. For example, SDDR cannot replicate the functionality of Google Latitude, which provides updates on friend locations independent of physical distance.

Another issue is that the radio range might not be limiting enough. For instance, an application that wants to create pairwise encounters and share a group secret only between users in the same room may face challenges, as messages can be received outside the room, enabling a passive eavesdropper to learn the group secret. External mechanisms, such as a fast-attenuating ultrasound identification beacon, may be required to manage the impedance mismatch between application semantics and radio range.

In general, application designers may choose to use SDDR for a base level of peer detection and impose criteria to filter unwanted peers. However, radio range-limited communication can have beneficial effects. In many situations, the Bluetooth radio range includes the attendees of a socially meaningful event—those with whom a user is likely to interact or share an experience.

Finally, the confidentiality and anonymity provided by SDDR may disproportionately empower abusive users who could spam or otherwise abuse those nearby. Here, radio range-limited communication provides both a bound on abusive communication and a rudimentary form of accountability. If SDDR is used for malice, the victim is assured that the source of the communication is nearby. The victim could move or provide evidence of misbehavior (received messages) to law enforcement authorities. The physical proximity (either of the sender or an accomplice) required for communication within SDDR can potentially serve as a deterrent to abusive communication.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we articulate the need for efficient secure mobile encounters and their requirements, including selective linkability and efficient revocation. We propose a lightweight protocol called SDDR, which provably meets the security requirements under the random oracle model and enables highly scalable and energy-efficient implementations using Bluetooth. Experimental results show that our protocol outperforms standard Private Set Intersection by four orders of magnitude. Additionally, its energy efficiency exceeds that of SmokeScreen by an order of magnitude while supporting stronger guarantees. Energy consumption (and the resulting battery life) remains practical even under worst-case conditions like dense crowds or DoS attacks.
