### Impact of Device Usage Patterns

The varying utility of cross-device data in different prediction tasks raises an important question: what factors contribute to these differences? Our experimental results suggest that the availability of cross-device data does not always lead to better predictions. 

#### Analysis of Device Usage Patterns

To understand this, we examined the device usage patterns of users in our dataset. Specifically, we observed that some users access finance and value shopping domains exclusively from either their desktop or mobile devices (e.g., through a mobile website or app). This pattern was evident for both users interested in finance and those identified as value shoppers, a randomly selected persona category.

For both interest groups, we evaluated the extent to which users accessed the top 25 finance and value shopping domains on their mobile and desktop devices. The results, illustrated in Figure 8, indicate that having data from both mobile and desktop devices increases the likelihood of capturing more salient features for these predictions. For instance, an ad network without access to desktop data would struggle to correctly classify users who only access these domains via their desktops.

However, it is important to note that these observations are based on a small number of users, and further investigation is warranted.

#### Absence of Device Usage

During our study, we also explored the possibility of making predictions about users who do not use their devices. An illustrative example is predicting a user's adherence to the Jewish faith. While religious web domains and apps can be meaningful features, subtler behaviors can also provide insights. For example, during the last two days of the Jewish Passover holiday, we noticed that some users did not use any of their devices, adhering to the religious practice of abstaining from electronics. This pattern was particularly clear when considering multiple devices; while some users might not use one device, only those observing Passover refrained from using both. This example demonstrates that device activity (or lack thereof) can be a useful predictor in cross-device tracking.

### Scope of Cross-Device Tracking

The extent of cross-device tracking on the Internet remains largely unexplored. Companies like Facebook and Google, with their extensive reach into various devices, appear to have the capability to deterministically match users across devices. However, the percentage of typical Internet users tracked by such companies is unknown. We address this question by examining the presence of cross-device trackers in the browsing and app histories of users in our dataset.

#### Detecting Cross-Device Trackers

**Procedure:**
We used an automated Firefox browser with Selenium, equipped with Lightbeam and User Agent Switcher extensions, to record trackers on each domain for both mobile and desktop websites. Third-party trackers found in subdomains were added to the main domain, but not vice versa. For apps, we selected 153 third-party SDKs from AppBrain, covering ad networks, social networks, and analytics services. We then determined which SDKs were included in the apps in our dataset. A company was classified as a cross-device tracker if their trackers were detected on both mobile and desktop domains, and if their websites claimed they perform cross-device tracking. We used Whois domain searches and tracker blocking lists, especially the Better tracker blocker list, to identify these trackers. For some companies, such as Google AdSense, Rubicon Project, Skimlinks, Tapad, and Lotame, our information flow experiment provided empirical support for their classification as cross-device trackers.

**Lower Bound:**
Our approach for detecting trackers should be considered a lower bound. Some trackers not identified by Lightbeam and SDKs not included in our predefined set will remain undetected. Additionally, we only detect app tracking via SDKs and do not account for Android WebViews and app-internal browsers, which may contain traditional online tracking mechanisms. Further investigation into these technologies is necessary.

**Limitations:**
Our crawl had limitations, such as inaccessible websites requiring user login, redirects, and missing pages. These issues affected only a few URLs. Additionally, the sites were crawled about a month after data collection, so some trackers may have changed. Ideally, live tracking from users' devices during the study would have been preferable, but this is challenging due to the constraints of the Android environment, particularly the sandboxing of mobile browsers.

#### Cross-Device Tracking Analysis

As shown in Figure 10, we found 9,732 unique third-party trackers on desktop websites and 3,243 on mobile websites. Of these, 2,571 trackers were present on both types of websites. From the 153 SDKs, we identified 81 in our dataset. In total, we found 124 cross-device trackers belonging to 87 different companies. It appears that 22 companies follow a deterministic approach, 39 use probabilistic techniques, and 26 leverage both.

On average, each user in our dataset is tracked across devices in 67% of desktop website visits and 64% of mobile web visits. Table 5 shows the reach of individual companies, with Google Analytics, Google Display, and Facebook capturing at least 20% of an average user's online traffic across devices. This percentage is consistent with previous studies on tracking of individual devices.

Partnerships between cross-device companies extend their reach. For example, Atlas receives user data from Facebook to track users deterministically, extending Facebook's mobile web reach. Similarly, the partnership between Lotame and Skimlinks, observed in our initial experiment, also extends their respective reach.

#### Domains with Cross-Device Company Concentration

Media websites, particularly those of newspapers, contain the highest concentration of cross-device trackers. Table 6 shows the top ten domains with the highest number of trackers from the 87 identified cross-device companies, separated for desktop and mobile websites. Many of these websites are popular, as indicated by their Quantcast country rank. However, while there is a tendency for domains hosting many cross-device companies on their desktop sites to also host many on their mobile sites, no statistically significant correlation was found. Figure 11 illustrates this distribution.

### Does Self-Regulation Work?

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that cross-device companies be transparent about their data practices. While there are no specific statutes or regulations for cross-device tracking in the U.S., the field is subject to self-regulation, primarily by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and the Network Advertising Initiative. The DAA requires its member companies to disclose that data collected from one device may be used with another linked device.
