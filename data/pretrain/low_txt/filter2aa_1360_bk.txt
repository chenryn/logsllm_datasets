This robust solution combines the features of many resources into a single search. It relies on the Twitter API, which limits the analysis to the most recent 3,200 Tweets. When I searched my own account, I received a summary that included the following investigative benefits:

- **Tweet sources:** This discloses the source of submission, such as mobile, desktop, or API.
- **Domains shared:** This summarizes the web links posted within Tweets.
- **Word cloud:** This provides a summary of the most common words posted.

- **Real World Application:** In 2017, I assisted a law enforcement agency with a missing juvenile case. The Twitter profile had no valuable Tweets, but Spoonbill revealed a log of changes, including a Snapchat username added two months before her disappearance. This led to new leads and eventually to the safe location of the juvenile.

These tools can help identify location data in Tweets. While privacy-aware individuals have disabled the location feature, many users still broadcast their location. Historical data is often more useful for geolocation, as many users unknowingly shared their location for years.
