# Analysis of TCP Round-Trip Times (RTTs) Variability

## 1. Introduction
This document presents an analysis of the variability in round-trip times (RTTs) within TCP connections. The study is based on passive analysis of over one million TCP connections between a large campus and more than 20,000 destinations.

## 2. RTT Distribution and Variability

### 2.1 Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
Figure 2(a) shows the CDF of minimum, median, mean, 90th percentile, and maximum per-connection RTTs. The x-axis represents RTT values in milliseconds, and the y-axis represents the cumulative probability.

### 2.2 Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF)
Figure 2(b) shows the CCDF of the same RTT metrics. The x-axis represents RTT values in milliseconds, and the y-axis represents the complementary cumulative probability.

### 2.3 Standard Deviation of RTTs
Figure 3(a) shows the CDF of the standard deviation of RTTs. The x-axis represents the standard deviation in milliseconds, and the y-axis represents the cumulative probability. Figure 3(b) shows the relationship between the average and 90th percentile standard deviations and the minimum RTT.

### 2.4 Inter-Quartile Range (IQR)
Figure 4(a) shows the CDF of the IQR of RTTs. The x-axis represents the IQR in milliseconds, and the y-axis represents the cumulative probability. Figure 4(b) shows the relationship between the IQR and the difference between the median and minimum RTT.

### 2.5 Comparison of Max, 90th, and Median RTTs to Min RTT
Figure 5(a) shows the CDF of the ratios of maximum, 90th percentile, and median RTTs to the minimum RTT. The x-axis represents the ratio, and the y-axis represents the cumulative probability. Figure 5(b) shows the relationship between the 90th percentile RTT and the minimum RTT.

### 2.6 Distribution of IQR/(Median - Min)
Figure 6 shows the CDF of the ratio of IQR to (median - min) RTT. The x-axis represents the ratio, and the y-axis represents the cumulative probability.

## 3. Key Findings

### 3.1 IQR and RTT Variability
- The IQR of RTTs within a TCP connection can be as large as several seconds.
- A significant fraction of connections have an IQR of more than 1 second.
- The IQR increases linearly with the translated median RTT (median - min RTT).
- Connections with higher median RTTs exhibit larger disparities in RTT distribution.
- For connections with a minimum RTT of 100 ms or less, the 90th percentile IQR is substantially higher than the average, indicating greater variability in RTTs.

### 3.2 RTT Ratios
- Over 80% of connections have an IQR value greater than their translated median, indicating high RTT variability.
- Approximately 10% of connections have an IQR to translated median ratio greater than 2, indicating extreme RTT variability.
- Approximately 10% of connections have a ratio less than 0.5, indicating little RTT variability. The remainder experience moderate variability.

### 3.3 Median, 90th, and Max RTTs vs. Min RTT
- Around 70% of connections see a median RTT that is 1.5 to 2 times the minimum RTT.
- Around 30% of connections see a median RTT that is more than 2.5 times the minimum RTT.
- Around 20% of connections see a maximum RTT and 90th percentile RTT that is more than 5 times the minimum RTT.

### 3.4 SYN/SYN+ACK RTTs
- For almost 90% of connections, the minimum RTT is equal to the SYN RTT.
- For 10% of connections, the SYN RTT exceeds the minimum RTT by more than 20%.
- Around 20% of connections sample a SYN RTT that differs from the median RTT by more than 20%, indicating that the SYN RTT may not be a good approximation of the typical RTT.

## 4. Related Work
- Previous studies have reported similar distributions of mean RTTs but have not extensively analyzed RTT variability.
- Some studies have used a single per-connection RTT, often derived from the SYN/SYN+ACK method, which may not accurately represent the typical RTT.

## 5. Summary
The study reveals significant variability in the per-segment RTTs of TCP connections. This variability has important implications for network performance and should be considered in future analyses and designs.
