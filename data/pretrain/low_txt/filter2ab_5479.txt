### Title: Making and Breaking NSA's Codebreaker Challenge

For the past decade, the National Security Agency (NSA) has hosted the Codebreaker Challenge, an annual competition designed and run by the agency's technical experts. Each year, the challenge features a new theme and a series of increasingly difficult rounds, including code analysis and reverse engineering. These challenges are meticulously crafted to simulate real-world problems that the NSA encounters in its mission.

The program has seen exponential growth since its inception. In 2013, only five schools participated, but by 2022, the competition attracted more than 4,800 participants from 449 schools across the United States. Last year, just 104 individuals (approximately 2% of participants) successfully completed all nine rounds of the challenge.

For the first time at Black Hat, the NSA will publicly share insights and lessons learned from running the Codebreaker Challenge. The presentation will delve into the design of the 2022 challenge, which focused on the NSA assisting FBI agents in responding to a U.S. company crippled by a ransomware attack.
