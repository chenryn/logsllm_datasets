### Investigating IAC Performance in Large Networks with Multiple Active Clients

We examine the performance of Interference Alignment and Cancellation (IAC) in a large network with many active clients, such as a large conference room. When the number of clients exceeds the maximum number of concurrent packets, there are multiple options for which clients can transmit simultaneously, both on the uplink and downlink. The choice of which clients to allow to transmit concurrently affects both fairness and the total data rate.

In any wireless network, there is an inherent trade-off between maximizing the transfer rate and ensuring fairness. The optimal choice for maximizing the rate would always favor the client with the best channel conditions, potentially starving other clients. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the performance of IAC in terms of both fairness and rate maximization.

#### Comparison of 802.11-MIMO and IAC Concurrency Algorithms

We compare 802.11-MIMO against three algorithms for selecting concurrent clients. All three algorithms select the packet at the head of the queue for transmission but differ in their approach to choosing additional packets for concurrent transmission:

1. **Brute Force Search**: This algorithm finds packets in the queue that maximize the overall rate.
2. **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**: This algorithm combines packets according to their arrival order.
3. **Best of Two Choices**: This algorithm, explained in §7.2, is the one adopted by IAC.

### Experimental Setup

The experiment involves all nodes in the testbed shown in Fig. 11. We designate three nodes as Access Points (APs) and the remaining 17 nodes as clients. Each client has infinite demands, ensuring that the throughput is not limited by the client's own demand but by the concurrency algorithm's decisions. Packets from different clients arrive in a random order. Each run involves using the medium for 1000 timeslots, and we repeat each run three times to compute the average rate per client. We test four designs: 802.11-MIMO, IAC+best-of-two, IAC+brute-force, and IAC+FIFO. For each client, we calculate the average rate achieved under 802.11-MIMO and the three IAC variants. We then compute the change in client transfer rate for each IAC variant compared to 802.11-MIMO.

### Results

Figures 15a and 15b show the Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) of the gains of the three IAC concurrency algorithms relative to 802.11-MIMO, both on the uplink and downlink. The key findings are:

- **Significant Gains Over 802.11-MIMO**:
  - Uplink: 
    - Brute force: 2.32x
    - FIFO: 1.9x
    - Best-of-two: 2.08x
  - Downlink:
    - Brute force: 1.58x
    - FIFO: 1.23x
    - Best-of-two: 1.52x
  (Note: While IAC’s multiplexing gain is capped at 2x, the total gain can be higher due to diversity gains.)

- **Fairness**:
  - The brute-force approach is highly unfair, with a few clients experiencing a significant boost in transfer rate while others have lower rates than with 802.11-MIMO.
  - The FIFO and best-of-two approaches offer better fairness, with the best-of-two approach providing the best balance between fairness and throughput.

- **Overall Performance**:
  - IAC, using the best-of-two approach, provides good fairness and high throughput. It delivers an average rate increase of 2.08x on the uplink and 1.52x on the downlink, without significantly reducing the rate for any client compared to 802.11-MIMO.

### Channel Reciprocity

We also investigate whether channel estimates based on reciprocity are accurate enough for use in IAC. We measure the uplink and downlink channels for 17 random client-AP pairs from the testbed and compute the calibration matrices. For each pair, we fix the AP and move the client, causing the uplink and downlink channels to change. The AP measures the uplink channel \( H^u \), multiplies it by the calibration matrices to estimate the downlink channel \( H^d_{\text{reciprocity}} \), and compares this estimate with the actual downlink channel \( H^d_{\text{true}} \). We compute the fractional error \( \text{Err} = \frac{\|H^d_{\text{true}} - H^d_{\text{reciprocity}}\|}{\|H^d_{\text{true}}\|} \) and plot the average fractional error in Fig. 16.

The results show that reciprocity holds to a large extent, with the fractional error between the actual downlink channel and the estimate based on reciprocity remaining small. This indicates that reciprocity is reasonably accurate even with client movement.

### Conclusion

This paper introduces IAC, which combines interference alignment and cancellation to double the throughput of MIMO LANs. IAC can provide benefits in various scenarios, including clustered MIMO networks, where links within clusters are strong and inter-cluster links are weak. Future work will explore IAC in ad-hoc and mesh settings.
