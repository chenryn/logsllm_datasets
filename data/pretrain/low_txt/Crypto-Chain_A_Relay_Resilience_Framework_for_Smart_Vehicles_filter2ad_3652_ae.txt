### Key Derivation Security Guarantees

Using FMK D provides an Enhanced Megamos Crypto, as described in the above fixes. The Enhanced Megamos Crypto theorem is provided in Appendix F.

### 7.2 Hitag-AES/Pro

The Hitag-AES/Pro [31] is a smart vehicle immobilizer transponder based on the AES 128-bit encryption algorithm. We extract the authentication protocol in Hitag-AES/Pro, as depicted in Figure 4. This protocol is designed to provide mutual authentication during communication between a reader and a transponder using a pre-established shared secret key.

**Figure 4: Hitag-AES/Pro Authentication Protocol**
- **Abbreviations:**
  - `auth` - Authentication request
  - `nR, nT` - Random nonces
  - `k` - Pre-established shared secret key
  - `PW DB` - Responder password

We model the initiator (i.e., the reader) and responder (i.e., the transponder in a car key) in a similar way to the Megamos Crypto, except that we use two machines, MA(H P) and MB(H B), to model the initiator and responder, respectively, of the Hitag-AES/Pro. At the end of the protocol execution, the instances exchange messages to authenticate each other in an ideal manner.

While Hitag-AES/Pro is widely used in the automotive industry, implementing the AES 128-bit encryption algorithm does not guarantee relay resilience. A relay attack can still be performed, regardless of the cryptographic algorithms deployed. Thus, Hitag-AES/Pro does not realize FMK D. To illustrate this, consider a setting where the honest initiator decrypts the fourth message `m` of the protocol, i.e., `Deck(m) = Deck(Enck(nR, PW DB))`, received from the honest responder, as per Figure 4. If `m` was sent or not sent by the responder, the initiator will still decrypt the message and act according to the protocol execution because `Enck(.)/Deck(.)` do not guarantee any relay resilience. Similar to the Megamos Crypto, this is not a direct attack on the protocol but rather shows that the security of `Enc(.)/Dec(.)` is insufficient to prove that a protocol is resilient against a relay attack.

A fix for this problem in our setting is to include a cryptographic proof during `Enck(.)` and verify the proof during `Deck(.)` using the `ComP&E` and `VerP/ValT` commands of FCC, respectively. Then, use the `VerETimeMKD` operation of FMK D to validate the expected time of completing the protocol execution. This allows the enhancement of the protocol using FMK D, resulting in an Enhanced Hitag-AES/Pro. Other commands of FMK D and FCC can also be used in the protocol. The Enhanced Hitag-AES/Pro theorem is provided in Appendix G.

### 8. Related Work

The role of relay attacks in exploits against cryptographic protocols in smart vehicles has been widely recognized, with practical implementations detailed in [14, 34, 36]. We adopt the practical implementation in [36] and focus on proving relay security as a form of relay resilience solution and enhancement to existing related work. Verdult et al. [35] discussed an effective authentication protocol for mitigating relay attacks. The protocol relies on the AES 128-bit encryption algorithm, which is already implemented in ATA5795C and Hitag-AES/Pro. However, the AES 128-bit encryption algorithm does not solve the problem of relay attacks, as encrypted data can be relayed without decryption. Relay attacks are independent of the cipher used in designing the protocol.

Similarly, using authentication for relay resilience is frequently discussed in [25, 26, 39], and poor implementation of authentication protocols can expose applications to relay attacks due to errors such as lack of key update and randomization during authentication. Ahmad et al. [2] presented a secure passive keyless entry and start method using machine learning. While the method supports the detection of relay attacks in a challenge-response setting between a key fob and a vehicle, it does not support mutual authentication between the devices, i.e., the key fob and the vehicle. Mutual authentication between the devices is crucial to mitigate authentication evasion.

Wang et al. [37] proposed a context-based secure keyless entry system that supports communication over Bluetooth between the key fob and vehicle. The system grants access to the vehicle via a connection established using information extracted from the surrounding environment. At the end of the connection establishment, the vehicle generates a signature for the key fob. However, the system relies on public and private keys issued by either an authority or another device, presenting a single point of failure and introducing extra communication and computational overheads. Thus, the system does not support key derivation for signatures between the key fob and vehicle.

Choi et al. [8] proposed a sound-based proximity-detection method for relay attack mitigation on PKES systems. However, the method presents a single point of failure due to reliance on a pre-shared key for authentication between the key fob and vehicle. Such reliance makes the implementation very difficult and expensive in real-world environments.

In this paper, we argue that mutual authentication and key derivation are required to verify user identity and derive a shared secret session key, respectively. Mutual authentication is applied to prevent an attacker from interfering with transmitted messages between two users. Our framework, built irrespective of hardware compatibility, uses the combination of cryptographic operations, knowledge of the computation time of the operations, and cryptographic timestamps to mitigate relay attacks based on universal composability. While many existing solutions did not prove relay security, we provide a framework that proves relay protection for smart vehicles. Our result allows proving relay security as long as we restrict smart vehicles to our cryptographic operations, knowledge of the computation time of the operations, and cryptographic timestamps. Our framework provides a strong form of relay security for users of smart vehicles.

### 9. Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we present a universally composable framework, Crypto-Chain, to analyze relay security of many real-world protocols in smart vehicles and provide relay resilience solutions. Crypto-Chain consists of an ideal crypto-chain functionality FCC for cryptographic operations and an ideal functionality for mutual authentication and key derivation FMK D. FCC models various cryptographic primitives, including our new DMA and KKE. These primitives can be combined and used to negotiate a shared secret session key for relay resilience.

We have provided a mutual authentication and key derivation protocol MKD to further validate the beneficial use of Crypto-Chain for the design of relay resilience cryptographic protocols in smart vehicles. We have implemented MKD and validated its performance and relay resilience capabilities. We demonstrated the usefulness of Crypto-Chain in two case studies, namely Megamos Crypto and Hitag-AES/Pro. We uncovered some weaknesses in the relay security of the protocols and used Crypto-Chain to provide relay resilience by enhancing the security of the protocols. In future work, we will apply Crypto-Chain to other real-world protocols and extend it to further mitigate ransomware attacks in smart vehicles.
