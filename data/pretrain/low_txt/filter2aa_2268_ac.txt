# Advanced Malwares and Security Protections

## Overview
This presentation by Alexandre Borges, a malware and security researcher, delves into the intricacies of advanced malware, particularly those targeting the UEFI/BIOS and other low-level system components. The discussion includes various security features and vulnerabilities, as well as tools and techniques for detecting and mitigating these threats.

## Key Components and Threats

### System Components
- **Loader**
- **Operating System (OS)**
- **SPI Flash**
- **Ring 0 Malware (e.g., Rootkits)**
- **SPI Malware**
- **Bootkit Malware**
- **UEFI Files: Bootx64.efi and Bootmgfw.efi**
- **Kernel Code Signing Policies**
- **UEFI Services**
- **System Management Mode (SMM)**
- **SMM Malware**
- **UEFI/BIOS Malware**
- **Flash Write Protection**

### UEFI Initialization Phases
- **SEC (Security Phase)**: Initializes caches, TPM, and MTRR.
- **PEI (Pre-EFI Initialization Phase)**: Manages SMM and memory.
- **DXE (Driver Execution Environment Phase)**: Initializes platform and devices, dispatches drivers, and enumerates firmware volumes.
- **BDS (Boot Device Selection Phase)**: Selects boot device and loads the EFI Shell or OS Boot Loader.
- **TSL (Transient System Load Phase)**
- **RT (Run Time Phase)**

### Hardware and Software Security Features
- **Boot Guard**: Validates the boot process using public keys associated with BIOS signatures.
- **OS Secure Boot**
- **UEFI Secure Boot**
- **Initial Boot Block (IBB)**
- **Hypervisor**
- **Windows Boot Loader**
- **Kernel Drivers**
- **Early Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM)**
- **Third-Party Drivers**
- **Applications**

### SPI Flash Regions
- **Flash Descriptors**
- **BIOS**
- **ME (Management Engine)**
- **GbE (Gigabit Ethernet)**
- **ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) EC (Embedded Controller)**

### Management Engine (ME)
- **Access to DRAM and network interface**
- **Always active, even when the system is powered off**
- **Potential security risk due to its extensive access and invisibility**

### Intel Boot Guard
- **Validates the boot process using public keys in FPFs (Field Programmable Fuses)**
- **Requires the SPI region to be locked and properly configured to prevent SMM driver rootkits**

### BIOS Guard
- **Runs in SMM to protect against unauthorized SPI flash access and BIOS updates**
- **Ensures only trusted modules can modify the SPI flash memory**

### Secure Boot
- **Protects the boot path from bootkit infections**
- **Verifies key components, drivers, and system files using digital signatures**
- **Prevents loading of unsigned code**

### Secure Boot Components
- **Platform Key (PK)**
- **Key Exchange Key (KEK)**
- **Authorized Database (db)**
- **Forbidden Database (dbx)**

### Vulnerabilities and Mitigations
- **UEFI Image Integrity**: Ensuring the integrity of UEFI images prevents rootkits from loading malicious images.
- **Terse Executable (TE) Format**: UEFI BIOS should not load TE format images as they do not support signatures.
- **Windows SMM Security Mitigation Table (WSMT)**: Introduced in Windows 10 version 1607, it ensures that SMM firmware is authorized and trusted by Virtualized Based Security (VBS).

### Tools and Techniques
- **Chipsec Utility**: Used for analyzing and securing the SPI flash and other system components.
  - `chipsec_util.py spi dump spi.bin`
  - `chipsec_util.py decode spi.bin`
  - `chipsec_main --module common.bios_wp`
  - `chipsec_main.py -m common.bios_smi`
  - `chipsec_main.py -m common.spi_lock`
  - `python chipsec_main.py --module common.bios_ts`
  - `chipsec_main.py -m common.smrr`

### Conclusion
- **Challenges in Analyzing Malicious Drivers**: The complexity of the theory and lack of awareness among users.
- **Firmware Update Awareness**: Many users are unaware of the importance of updating their systems' firmware.
- **Integrity-Based Protections**: Current protections rely on digital certificates and signatures, which may be vulnerable to future quantum computing attacks.
