**ATT&CK ID:** T0878  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Alarm Suppression

Adversaries may target and suppress protection function alarms to prevent operators from being notified of critical conditions. These alarm messages are often a key component of an overall reporting system and can be of particular interest to adversaries. It is important to note that the disruption of the alarm system does not necessarily imply the disruption of the entire reporting system.
