## 1. Context, Motivation, and Focus

Advancements in semiconductor technologies are enabling unprecedented levels of information processing, novel architectural solutions, and a new realm of applications by integrating extremely large numbers of scaled-down transistors or processing elements into a single chip. Two main tracks are being considered to achieve this:

1. **Top-down "More Moore":** This track continues the long-standing trend based on Moore's Law, aiming to reduce the dimensions of silicon microelectronics to the nanometric scale.
2. **Bottom-up "Beyond Moore":** This track departs from classical silicon technologies and includes assemblies of nanoscale devices such as nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and organic molecules, extending to quantum computing, optical computing, and micro/nanofluidics.

Due to the differences in relative advances and current industrial concerns, this second edition of the workshop will emphasize the top-down track, which poses serious challenges from both dependability and security perspectives.

The ongoing trend in IC development is aimed at achieving nanometric-scale elementary devices. Emerging downsized technologies are already facing significant variations in process parameters, making it difficult for reliability engineers to achieve an acceptable manufacturing yield at a viable cost. The dramatic reduction in digital device sizes is accompanied by lower power supply and threshold levels, leading to reduced noise immunity and greater sensitivity to radiation particles. Additionally, operational instabilities, such as negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) in CMOS devices, can affect circuits over time.

Beyond the impact of accidental defects and disturbances, one must also consider vulnerabilities and malicious threats related to hardware chips. These include information leakages due to side-channel attacks or differential fault analysis, which can be facilitated by environmental disturbances or fault injection. While device downsizing and increased chip complexity are often seen as positive factors in reducing hardware vulnerabilities, the observability and controllability provided by testing devices incorporated into the chips should not be neglected.

Emerging nanoscale technologies are inherently exposed to a significant rate of residual defects and fault occurrences. Manufacturing processes, while rapidly evolving, still suffer from significant statistical variability in key physical, chemical, and electrical properties. These devices, due to their very small scale, are prone to various kinds of noise, including energy coupling, temperature variations, and single-event upsets. At this scale, there is limited ability to monitor what is happening, making failure analysis extraordinarily difficult. Planning and developing tools suitable for nanoscale devices and circuit fabrics will be a new frontier for the digital circuit and system design process in the coming years. Recent advances in hybrid chip design are paving the way for significant achievements.

## 2. Towards Resilient Nanocomputing

For both the top-down and bottom-up tracks, the key challenge is building resilient systems from imperfect devices. This question harkens back to the early days of digital computers and relates to seminal work on improving reliability by Moore, Shannon, and Von Neumann, revisited in recent studies.

Several recent advances have been made to address these issues, such as the concept of "probabilistic chips," which relax the correctness requirement to produce significant energy savings. High degrees of parallelization, relying on a very large number of computing nodes, are also being considered as fitting alternatives to common scalar or superscalar architectures. Such designs favor online reconfiguration and resilience enhancement via accelerated aging and other techniques.

There is a strong demand for solutions to improve dependability and security. Issues at stake include managing complexity and manufacturing defects, as well as susceptibility to environmental disturbances. These solutions extend beyond hardware, microelectronics, or physics, encompassing major computing-related issues such as architecture, networks, communication, synchronization, and task parallelization.

The workshop aims to further characterize these impairments and threats, as well as distinguish possible alternative design approaches and operation control paradigms that need to be enforced or favored to achieve dependable and secure computing. Assessment methods, such as risk evaluation, validation, and testing, should also play a fundamental role. For these reasons, we believe that DSN is an ideal forum to address these issues and foster fruitful exchanges on a long-term basis.

**Main topics of interest include:**
- Failure modes specific to nanocomputing technologies
- Soft errors in nanocomputing devices
- Yield and mitigation techniques in nanocomputing
- Online monitoring of physical parameters as reliability indicators
- Fault tolerance mechanisms for nanoscale chips
- Online adaptive and reconfigurable nanoarchitectures
- Scalable verification, testing, and diagnosis methods
- Failure modes assessment and risk analysis
- Malicious threats and security issues
- Resilience issues in emerging nanoscale fabrics and technologies

**Three main goals for the workshop:**
1. Review the state-of-knowledge concerning the threats in nanocomputing technologies, including manufacturing defects, accidental operational faults, and malicious attacks.
2. Identify existing solutions and propose new solutions for mitigating faults and implementing secure and resilient computing devices and systems.
3. Forecast the risks associated with emerging technologies and foster new trends for cooperative work, possibly combining various alternatives to increase the pace of advances and solutions.

To achieve these goals, the planned program features invited talks, submitted papers, and a panel. We hope you will enjoy the workshop and actively participate by interacting with the various contributors. Your comments and suggestions for future plans of this event are also welcome.
