### Explorations and Methodology

**Introduction:**
First, users may not be fully aware of how their PIN management behavior varies across different assets. To address this, we conducted semi-structured interviews, allowing participants to openly discuss their PIN management experiences. This format not only provided quantitative data but also enabled us to ask clarifying and follow-up questions, enhancing the qualitative analysis.

**Challenges in Data Collection:**
Collecting user-selected PINs for a wide range of assets can become impractical due to the many-to-many mapping between PINs and asset categories. Such a study, while valuable, would be extremely time-consuming and prone to errors. Semi-structured interviews allowed us to perform exploratory analysis on the types of assets protected by PINs and to investigate usage strategies, providing a deeper understanding of the specific PINs used in each asset class.

**Pilot Study:**
To develop our survey instrument, we initially conducted a pilot study with four participants from the first author’s department. These participants were invited to a lab where they completed a structured survey covering demographics, self-reported proficiency with technology and computer security, and living arrangements (see Appendix A.1 for details). Participants then enumerated all the PINs they use, providing information on selection, resources protected, and perceived sensitivity. We also inquired about the frequency of PIN entry, sharing practices, and any encountered attacks and their responses.

**Survey Redesign:**
During the pilot, participants found the survey cumbersome due to repetitive questions. We addressed this by redesigning the survey into four sections: one for questions independent of or pertaining to all asset categories, and three for category-specific questions. This redesign allowed us to collect qualitative data effectively without fatiguing participants. We also noted that users often use multiple PINs within each category. In the updated survey, we collected information on the number of PINs used per category and asked participants to respond to category-specific questions for their most frequently used PIN in each category. This design choice balanced data quality and participant engagement.

**Main Study:**
The redesigned survey was conducted with a new group of 35 participants (Table 1). All participants completed the surveys within an hour, a more acceptable timeframe. The categorization of questions provided meaningful insights into participants’ behavior regarding the PIN lifecycle.

**Methodology:**
We received ethical approval for this study. Participants were recruited through local classified ads, flyers, and word-of-mouth, and were offered $25 for their participation in a one-hour study at the University of Guelph. They were instructed not to reveal their actual PINs to the researchers.

**Asset Categorization:**
Before the interview, we defined digital asset PINs as those used to unlock digital devices or authenticate to mobile and web apps. Financial asset PINs controlled access to financial assets like ATM cards and banking apps. Physical asset PINs controlled access to physical assets such as home locks and security systems.

**Results:**
In total, 140 PINs were reported, with an average of 4 PINs per participant. These PINs protected 231 assets, categorized as digital (41%), financial (36%), and physical (23%). Participants rated the security of their assets highly, with no significant differences between asset groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, p(2)=4.98, p=0.08).

**PIN Usage Frequency:**
Participants authenticated to digital assets more frequently than financial or physical assets. Daily usage for digital assets was 94%, compared to 41% for financial and 48% for physical assets. Some participants preferred NFC-based tap-to-pay for financial transactions.

**PIN Age and Updates:**
The median age of PINs for digital, financial, and physical assets was 5, 8.5, and 4.5 years, respectively. Six participants never changed their PINs. PIN updates were often due to compromise (18%) or preventive security measures (31%). Other reasons included memorability (24%) and device upgrades (32% for digital assets). Popular PIN update strategies included choosing easy-to-remember numbers or significant dates.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings highlight the importance of PIN management and the need for better security practices. Despite the prevalence of insecure PIN selection strategies, participants often prioritized memorability over security. Further research is needed to understand and improve PIN management behaviors.
