**Title: Is the Mafia Taking Over Cybercrime?**

Claims that the Mafia is not only getting involved in, but also taking a leading role in cybercrime, are widespread. These assertions can be found in media articles, blogs, and discussions with information security professionals, and have become a mainstream position. However, what evidence supports these claims?

Drawing on a seven-year University of Oxford study into the organization of cybercrime, this talk evaluates whether the Mafia is indeed taking over cybercrime or if the structure of the cybercriminal underground represents something entirely new. The analysis brings serious empirical rigor to a question where such evidence is often lacking. It is based on nearly 250 interviews with law enforcement, private sector experts, and former cybercriminals, conducted in approximately 20 countries, including known cybercrime "hotspots" such as Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Nigeria, Brazil, and China.

The talk broadly addresses the connections between Mafias, organized crime, and cybercrime, with a particular focus on the so-called "Russian Mafia." This focus is due to the frequent mention of the Russian Mafia in many claims and the fact that some of the most sophisticated cybercriminals are based in the former Soviet Bloc. The discussion will provide a more informed understanding of what constitutes a Mafia, the evolution of the Russian Mafia, and known cases where organized criminals have been directly involved in cybercrime.

In determining whether cybercrime is best conceptualized and addressed through an organized crime framework, this talk is relevant to a range of cybersecurity community members, including policymakers, law enforcement, and the private sector. The presentation is an exclusive preview of material from a book to be published by Harvard University Press in the fall.
