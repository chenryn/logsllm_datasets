# Android Malware Characterization and Security Software Evaluation

## Abstract
This study presents a comprehensive characterization of existing Android malware, covering 1260 samples across 49 different families from August 2010 to October 2011. The analysis reveals that 86.0% of the malware repackages legitimate apps, 36.7% contains platform-level exploits, and 93.0% exhibits bot-like capabilities. An evaluation of four popular mobile security software (Lookout, TrendMicro, AVG, and Norton) shows detection rates ranging from 20.2% to 79.6%. These findings highlight the need for more advanced anti-malware solutions.

## Introduction
The rapid growth of smartphone usage has led to an increase in mobile malware. This paper characterizes Android malware and evaluates the effectiveness of current mobile security software. The dataset includes 1260 malware samples from 49 families, collected over a year. The analysis covers various aspects of malware, including repackaging, privilege escalation, and bot-like behavior. The results show significant challenges in detecting and mitigating these threats.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
- **Dataset**: 1260 Android malware samples from 49 families.
- **Time Frame**: August 2010 to October 2011.
- **Sources**: Official and alternative Android markets, security alerts, and reports.

### Analysis
- **Repackaging**: 86.0% of malware repackages legitimate apps.
- **Privilege Escalation**: 36.7% of malware contains platform-level exploits.
- **Bot-like Behavior**: 93.0% of malware exhibits bot-like capabilities.

### Security Software Evaluation
- **Software Tested**: Lookout, TrendMicro, AVG, Norton.
- **Detection Rates**:
  - Lookout: 79.6%
  - TrendMicro: 76.7%
  - AVG: 54.7%
  - Norton: 20.2%

## Results
### Scanning Results
The scanning results are summarized in Table VII, which lists the malware families, sample counts, and detection rates by each security software. For example, Lookout detected 1003 out of 1260 samples, while Norton detected only 254.

### Detection Challenges
- **Diverse Approaches**: Different security software use varying methods, leading to inconsistent detection rates.
- **New Malware**: Some malware families (e.g., BeanBot, CoinPirate, DroidCoupon, DroidKungFuSapp, NickyBot, RogueLemon) were not detected, likely due to their recent discovery and lack of signatures.

## Discussion
### Key Findings
1. **Repackaging**: Most Android malware (86.0%) repackages legitimate apps, indicating the need for better market policing and repackaging detection.
2. **Exploits**: Over one-third (36.7%) of malware uses platform-level exploits, highlighting the need for improved security features like ASLR and TrustZone.
3. **SMS Abuse**: Many malware (45.3%) subscribe to premium-rate services via background SMS messages and intercept incoming SMS messages.
4. **Security Software Limitations**: Traditional signature-based approaches are insufficient, and new models are needed for effective mobile malware detection.

### Recommendations
- **Market Policing**: Collaborative efforts to detect and discourage repackaged apps.
- **Platform Security**: Enhance security features and address fragmentation issues.
- **Fine-Grained Permissions**: Expand the Android permission model to include context information.
- **Advanced Detection**: Develop more sophisticated detection techniques beyond traditional signatures.

## Related Work
- **Privacy and Security**: Studies like TaintDroid, PiOS, Comdroid, and Woodpecker have exposed privacy leaks and confused deputy problems on Android.
- **Platform Extensions**: Proposals like Apex, MockDroid, TISSA, and AppFence aim to provide finer-grained controls and enhanced security.
- **Malware Surveys**: Felt et al. surveyed 46 malware samples on iOS, Android, and Symbian, while Becher et al. provided a survey of mobile network security.

## Conclusion
This study provides a systematic characterization of Android malware, revealing the prevalence of repackaging, privilege escalation, and bot-like behavior. The evaluation of existing security software highlights the need for more advanced anti-malware solutions. Future work should focus on developing and implementing these solutions to effectively combat mobile malware.
