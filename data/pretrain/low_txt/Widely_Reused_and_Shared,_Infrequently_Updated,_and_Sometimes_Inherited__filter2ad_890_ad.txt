### 4. Weakness and Vulnerability of PINs

Four participants indicated that they were aware their PINs were weak and could be easily guessed. One participant, P25, commented, "I didn’t ask how he [the perpetrator] got to know, but I guess he watched me type it or he may have guessed it since it was simple enough."

Participants also relied on other security measures to complement the protection provided by PINs. These included:
- Risk aversion of attackers against financial and physical assets (discussed earlier).
- Deterrence due to the presence of surveillance cameras.
- Being cautious with their belongings in the presence of potential attackers.

For example, P33 noted, "For the gym locker PIN, I am worried sometimes because many people are around, and I leave my wallet and phone in the bag when going for a shower. But there are cameras in some areas, so I think people would not try something silly."

Two participants expressed dissatisfaction with the PIN entry interface for Netflix's Parental Lock. They found that on large screens, the interface did not provide a way to enter the PIN discreetly in shared spaces, especially with children nearby. P24 stated, "When my kids ask me to play specific content, I have to ask them to leave the room."

The ease with which PINs can be shoulder-surfed is well-documented [28]. Our study confirms that users are aware of this issue, which negatively impacts their trust in PINs as an effective security control. We will discuss some remediation strategies in Section 6.

### 5. Memorability Issues

Participants ranked memorability as the most important criterion for selecting PINs. This high ranking may be attributed to the desire to avoid inconvenience. For instance, P32 explained, "You have to be really quick in restaurants or stores; you can’t be guessing and trying to remember it. That’s why I keep the same PIN."

Even when participants decided to update their PINs, memorability and ease of entry often took precedence over security. Three participants reported reverting to their old PINs due to frequent errors. P27 stated, "I did change after [my girlfriend learned it] because we were living in the same shared space, but made so many mistakes that I reverted; entry mistakes from muscle memory."

Stobert and Biddle [44] found that users develop coping mechanisms to deal with the difficulties of password authentication. Similarly, PIN users employ strategies to manage memorability challenges, often at the expense of security. In Section 6, we will discuss approaches to mitigate these memorability-related issues.

### 6. PINs and Past Relationships

Park et al. [37] conducted an online survey and found that marriage and cohabitation often result in the sharing of online accounts. Our findings are consistent with theirs. Participants frequently reported sharing their PINs with romantic partners.

Nine participants shared their digital PINs with former romantic partners. Three of these participants did not change their PINs, either because they still trusted the person or felt it unnecessary since the other person no longer had access to their assets. P6 remarked, "I changed it just for more privacy, but didn’t feel the need to change it." Other participants updated their PINs, though one reported, "[Did] nothing as I had the device" (P3). One participant changed their PIN because the other person still lived with them.

For financial assets, five participants shared their PINs with former partners, and only two updated them. These participants also updated their digital PINs after ending the relationship. Only four participants shared their physical PINs with past relationships, and only one updated it. These PINs were for home or garage access, and participants did not change them because they still trusted their ex-partners. P13 stated, "Nothing was done as there was never a problem."

While Park et al. [37] found that individuals often attempt to remove or disable a partner’s access to online accounts, our participants did not do this for PIN-protected assets. Unlike online accounts, accessing these assets requires both the PIN and physical access. However, with the increasing number of online services accepting PINs and widespread reuse, this poses a threat to accounts where PINs are reused. For such cases, it would be beneficial to consider the guidelines suggested by Obada-Obieh et al. [36] for improving the design of online accounts to better support users when they end account sharing.

### 7. Physical PIN Inheritance and Update

An interesting finding was the "inheritance" of physical PINs for garage doors. Nine participants moved into homes with pre-existing garage door PINs, but only three updated them. The remaining six kept the PIN set by the previous owner. One participant even reused the inherited PIN for their home lock: "Garage [PIN was set] by previous owner. [I] used it again for home lock that was installed afterwards" (P27).

Since four of these six participants changed their home locks, the lack of updating the garage door PIN cannot be attributed to trust. Instead, this insecure behavior is due to a lack of knowledge on how to update the PIN. P34 stated, "No, the garage was set up by the previous owner. We did change the key locks and considered updating the garage PIN, but there is no information available on how to do that."

This inability to update the garage door PIN was also voiced by participants when the PIN was accidentally divulged. P35 commented, "Once a person who was delivering a package [saw it]. My husband was concerned about it, but neither knew how to change it."

While instructions on how to update these PINs were missing, two participants acknowledged that laziness also contributed to the situation, and they had other resources available. P26 said, "[It was shared with the] Garage door repair person when they were here to fix the door. Didn’t change it... don’t know how to although I can google [search]."

One participant complained that the previous owner did not share the Master PIN, eliminating their ability to update it. The inability of users to effortlessly update PINs in case of a compromise could potentially result in security issues. In Section 6, we will discuss possible remediation strategies.

### 8. Future Research Directions

#### 8.1 PIN Choices and Management Strategies

Our participants widely shared and reused PINs and infrequently changed them, even after they were compromised. The main driving factor behind this risky behavior was the memorability of PINs. Most participants did not adopt a PIN management strategy by explicitly considering threat actors. When prompted to choose a PIN, they chose one they remembered well. Only a few participants considered the circles they had to share the PIN with before choosing it. Other factors to consider include the nature of the asset, the susceptibility to attacks (e.g., shoulder surfing is more of a threat for a smartphone than an ATM PIN), and the type of recourse available in the event of a compromise. Additional research is needed to understand how users with average technology and security proficiency can make secure PIN choices given these factors. This will enable researchers to create improvements that match user expectations in their everyday lives.

#### 8.2 PIN Recall for Multiple Assets

Participants use PIN-based authentication for an average of six assets, and recalling the correct PIN for each asset is problematic for several participants. Existing proposals on the memorability of PINs (discussed in Section 2) do not improve the situation with multiple assets and multiple PINs. A cued recall-based approach that allows participants to associate pairs of assets and PINs (or corresponding word representations of PINs) may offer mitigation. Digital wallets, for example, enable users to perform secure transactions without entering PINs, but such features are not available for all PINs, particularly physical ones. Digital apps for smartphones could be designed to help people with recall issues, similar to a password manager but enabling quick recall for digital, financial, and physical PINs.

#### 8.3 Confidence in PINs as a Security Control

Prior empirical studies report on the susceptibility of PINs to shoulder surfing attacks and users’ experiences of such attacks [4, 18, 22, 28]. Our study also uncovered limited levels of faith in PINs' resistance to shoulder surfing (see Section 4.6). While simple defenses like shielding the keypad while entering a PIN are effective, they are not widely used, indicating a lack of trust in observers.

Improved PIN entry interfaces have been proposed to provide defenses against shoulder surfing (discussed in Section 2), but their limited availability on smartphones may reduce the effectiveness of PINs as a security control. We also noted several cases where participants had to inadvertently share their PINs or enter PINs in front of others. The availability of a short-term device access approach like SnapApp [9] may help users greatly improve the security posture of their digital PINs.

#### 8.4 Improved Interfaces for PIN Update

PIN-based authentication on devices with limited interfaces (e.g., garage doors and digital home locks) introduces unique challenges. Our study shows that users are more likely to continue using inherited PINs for such assets due to a lack of clear and readily available instructions on how to update PINs. Furthermore, such assets may require a master PIN to update or reset PINs, and the storage and management of such a PIN further complicate the situation. One participant reported sharing the same PIN with people of different trust levels (e.g., family vs. pet caretaker) despite the availability of the digital home lock to create different PINs. This was primarily due to the inability of the device to report which PINs were used.

As the security of an asset depends on the ability to change the PIN in case of a compromise, there is a need to design a standard way to update and reset PINs on devices with limited interfaces (i.e., only keypad). Alternatively, instructions could be provided on physical locks to reduce barriers to PIN updates. While the availability of such unifying methods for updating PINs on future devices would encourage PIN updates after compromise, the challenge remains for millions of devices currently in use. One possible approach is to design augmented reality tools to address this gap by linking physical assists to known documentation and instructions for updating PINs.

### 9. Limitations

Our study has some inherent limitations, similar to other user studies. Many findings are based on self-reported data from willing participants. Prior empirical studies of PIN usage on smartphones [22] indicated that participants under-report their daily PIN usage, which may also be the case here. As a result, our results may underestimate the total number of PINs used across asset types, compounded by the fact that some categories, such as banking app PINs, could be classified as both digital and financial. To mitigate this limitation, we used a semi-structured interview method that included suggestions of assets to ensure participants thought of the diversity of assets where PINs are used.

Additionally, we asked several contextual questions for the most widely used PIN in each category. As a result, our study is limited in scope regarding the most widely used PINs, but we were able to collect quality responses from participants in a time-constrained lab-based study regarding the PINs that protect the most assets.

We were also geographically limited, with participants from the Waterloo and Guelph regions in Canada. This is a relatively safe place to work and live (as self-reported by the participants). The safe environment may have implicitly encouraged some unsafe practices among our participants for PINs protecting their physical assets. However, we believe this convenience sample generalizes to many other populations, though not all, and more research is needed to understand how different populations approach PIN security.

Finally, interviews were conducted by two researchers sequentially, using the same semi-structured script of questions. We found that the second researcher elicited more detailed quotes from participants, which are cited more throughout the document. However, data collected by the first researcher are still ecologically valid and were fully used in data analysis.

### 10. Conclusion

We conducted a study with 35 participants to understand how they manage PINs across different assets. Our findings show behavior that may result in potential compromises due to widespread sharing and reuse of PINs across different asset categories, primarily motivated by memorability. Memorability concerns also deter users from updating PINs after they are compromised. Participants reported a lack of confidence in PINs due to their susceptibility to shoulder surfing attacks—a concern that can be mitigated using PIN entry interfaces that resist shoulder surfing. Our study also shows that participants change their PIN management behavior for different types of assets due to the availability of other recourse in case of a compromise. Finally, we propose further research directions for researchers. With the increasing options to use PINs for authentication purposes for different types of assets, our findings will help researchers design tools and strategies to improve the security of PIN-protected assets.
