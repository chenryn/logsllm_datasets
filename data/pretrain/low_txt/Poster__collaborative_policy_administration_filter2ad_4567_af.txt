### Relocation, Redirection, and Evolution of Services

The involvement of a diverse range of individuals in the activities of relocation, redirection, and evolution of services has implications that extend beyond mere productivity, efficiency, or user experience. We must also consider the potential for new forms of co-governance, whether open or closed by design. These processes diverge from the traditional project-based engagement typical of design consultancy (Kimbell, 2012) and instead incorporate aspects that resemble activism (Julier, 2011) and even participation in social movement creation (Seppälä, 2012).

### Case Study: Cleaning Day (Siivouspäivä)

One example analyzed in our Special Interest Group (SIG) is the Cleaning Day (Siivouspäivä), a carnival-like event held twice a year. The event encourages people to sell, swap, and donate items they no longer use. The idea originated from informal conversations among friends about reducing household clutter while promoting recycling, upcycling, and community building. After an enthusiastic response to a Facebook post, a working group was formed to create a platform (including tools, information, resources, and communication channels) that citizens could use to transform Helsinki into a giant flea market for a day (Seppälä, 2012). Now in its third iteration, the initiative has spread to other cities.

This self-organizing group leveraged social media and distributed design skills to build momentum and mobilize participants. The event has also influenced how city authorities handle permits for selling second-hand goods in public spaces. Following the first Cleaning Day, the public works department of the City of Helsinki approached the organizing group to discuss cooperation. One outcome was the use of the Cleaning Day online platform to formalize flea-market activities without requiring individual permits. This collaboration between the Cleaning Day group and city officials exemplifies how "design-in-use" can emerge through practical, on-the-ground collaboration, hinting at the potential for new service constellations with various partnership models.

### Shifting Design Engagement

In these contexts, design engagement is evolving to focus on the resilience of co-designed services through active management of "design-in-use." This process involves not just designers and their methods but also the integration of designed artifacts and processes into everyday life, which may align with activist agendas but are not necessarily limited to them.

The concept of "design-in-use" now encompasses practices such as configuration, customization, adaptation, maintenance, reuse, and even redesign through "artful integrations" (Suchman, 1994) and bricolage-type activities (Büscher et al., 2001; Karasti & Syrjänen, 2004; Botero et al., 2010; Botero, 2013). Recent discussions under the rubric of infrastructuring and prototyping (Hillgren et al., 2011; Hillgren, 2013) highlight the need for more work in this area, especially given the different timeframes and rhythms of public and collaborative ventures compared to traditional design projects.

### Time, New Engagements, and Partnerships

Design interventions typically aim to produce specific outcomes or apply "designerly" techniques to service innovation problems within a set timeframe. However, the emergence of co-production and peer production of services requires a framework of co-governance and "design-in-use." This necessitates a new understanding of the timeframe for design and collaboration in public and collaborative settings.

Many of the cases presented in our book and analyzed in the SIG are not staged by designers or facilitators but are initiatives by active citizens who have recognized a need for action (e.g., Time banking, Cleaning Day, community spaces) and have sought out partners and tools to support their efforts. For designers to position themselves in the context of co-governance and "design-in-use," several challenges must be addressed, including ensuring the sustainability of co-produced services after the design research project ends.

### Responsibilities of Designers

What are the responsibilities of designers in this expanded timeframe? How long should designers remain involved in the evolution of a service? In our work, we have observed that sometimes it becomes necessary to disengage, yet we want to maintain accountability to the settings and people we have come to know and appreciate. When should this separation occur, or should further commitment, such as social entrepreneurship, be considered? Is the co-design setting the only factor maintaining the link between people and designers, or can there be other types of engagements and partnerships?

We welcome feedback, ideas, and fruitful conversations with the DESIS community to further develop these issues.

### Implications for Design Practice, Education, and Policymaking

#### Design Practice
- Develop new ways of engagement beyond traditional R&D project forms and consultancy models.
- Recognize that public and collaborative endeavors have different timeframes.
- Identify opportunities for participation and collaboration beyond designer-staged activities.
- Design for peer production and co-production, contributing to the creation of commons.

#### Design Education
- Foster cross-disciplinary study projects for the public sector.
- Educate designers in communication with policy experts, providing them with the necessary vocabulary and understanding of governance issues.
- Equip social workers, political scientists, and sociologists with basic design vocabulary.

#### Policymaking
- Create policies that provide spaces for experimentation and risk-taking in the public sector.
- Facilitate collaboration with community-led initiatives to scale them up and make them sustainable, including supporting infrastructure, recognition, and shared language.

### About the Authors

**Andrea Botero** is a doctoral candidate at the School of Arts, Design, and Architecture of Aalto University, where she also works as a project lead and designer in externally funded R&D projects. Her research focuses on the theoretical and practical implications of broad participation in creative design processes and how this relates to "innovation." Her design work explores services, media formats, genres, and technologies for communities and their social practices.

**Joanna Saad-Sulonen** is a doctoral candidate at the School of Arts, Design, and Architecture of Aalto University. With a background in architecture and new media and digital design, her research addresses the limitations of the current approach to participatory e-planning. She proposes a new conceptualization of participatory e-planning that enables the collaborative development of both technologies and participation processes concurrently.
