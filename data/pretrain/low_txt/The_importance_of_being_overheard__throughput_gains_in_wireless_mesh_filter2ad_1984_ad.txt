### Late-Night Testing to Minimize Interference

To minimize interference from the 802.11g production network, tests were conducted late at night. The Jigsaw nodes, which are significantly less powerful than those in the ALIX testbed, were found to be CPU-limited when using the MORE protocol. Therefore, results for MORE are not reported.

### Jigsaw Node Density and Layout

The Jigsaw nodes, originally deployed as a passive sniffer network, are densely packed. This density means that the overall results closely resemble those from the maximum-power ALIX experiment: there is little difference between ExOR and its variants, including modrate. However, due to the varying layouts of different floors, there is significant variation in connectivity. To account for this, we present performance data for each floor individually.

### Floor-Specific Performance Analysis

Figures 12 and 13 show the results for floors two and three, respectively. Each floor has a similar area and node density, allowing us to compare similar networks in different physical locations.

- **Floor Two:** Shows substantial improvement with modrate and bulk transport, similar to power level 50 in the ALIX testbed.
- **Floor Three:** Exhibits dramatic improvements under modrate, with some routes showing over 100% improvement, even beyond the already significant gains from group acknowledgments.
- **Floor Four (not shown):** Had several routes where modrate negatively impacted performance, likely due to discrepancies between predicted and actual reception rates, possibly caused by broadband interference or hidden terminals. Notably, the hidden terminals previously reported in the Jigsaw testbed [10] were located on the fourth floor.

### Summary of Findings

Most opportunistic bulk-transfer schemes in the literature use a single, fixed link rate. Our findings indicate that an adaptive scheme, even if it only considers the immediate next hop, is almost always superior. While joint optimization of link rates and overhearing potential may not significantly enhance ExOR's performance in many cases (a conclusion also reached by Chachulski regarding MORE [7]), our study reveals that overhearing itself often contributes minimally to ExOR's performance. Instead, more practical aspects like bulk transport and group acknowledgments provide the majority of the improvement. In only one configuration (the ALIX testbed at power level 40) did overhearing contribute more than a few percent to the median route's performance over a simple group-acknowledgment, bulk transfer scheme. In all other instances, nearly all improvements were achieved without relying on overhearing, regardless of whether link rates were optimized.
