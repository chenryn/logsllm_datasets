### Advantages of Our Scheme Over µTESLA

Our proposed scheme has four main advantages over µTESLA, which are detailed below:

1. **No Time Synchronization Requirement:**
   - In µTESLA, the sender and receivers rely on time synchronization and delayed disclosure to achieve the asymmetry needed for broadcast authentication. Our scheme, on the other hand, uses public-private key pairs, eliminating the need for time synchronization. This is particularly beneficial in large Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) where maintaining precise time synchronization can be impractical.

2. **No Buffering Needed by Receiver:**
   - µTESLA requires receivers to buffer messages until the corresponding MAC key is disclosed. In contrast, our scheme does not require receivers to buffer messages, as they can authenticate messages immediately upon receipt.

3. **Individual Authentication of Messages:**
   - With our scheme, receivers can individually authenticate a received packet without waiting for another packet. In µTESLA, receivers must wait for the packet containing the disclosed MAC key before they can authenticate a message.

4. **Instant Authentication of Messages:**
   - Our scheme allows receivers to instantly authenticate a received packet. In µTESLA, receivers must wait one or more time periods for the packet containing the disclosed MAC key, delaying the authentication process.

### Comparison with BiBa and HORS

We also compared our scheme with two other efficient one-time signature schemes, BiBa [2] and HORS [3]. At the same security level with system parameters \( t=1024 \), \( k=16 \), \( r=10 \), and \( h=5 \), our proposed scheme outperformed BiBa and HORS in three areas: computation, communication, and storage overhead. The results of our experiment are summarized in Table 4.1.

**Table 4-2: Signature Scheme Comparison**

| Metric | BiBa | HORS | Proposed Scheme |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Generation Overhead (hash computation) | 2048 | 1 | \( h=5 \) |
| Verification Overhead (hash computation) | 100 | \( 1+k=17 \) | \( h=5 \) |
| Communication (bytes) | 5250 | 5152 | 288 |
| Storage (bytes) | Large | Large | Small |
| Energy Cost | Large | Large | Small |
| Time Synchronization | Yes | Yes | No |

### Conclusion

In this paper, we propose an efficient broadcast authentication scheme for wireless sensor networks that utilizes a one-time signature scheme and a re-keying mechanism. Our scheme offers several desirable properties, including individual and instant authentication, robustness to packet loss, and low overhead in computation, communication, and storage. We improve upon the HORS one-time signature scheme by using Merkle hash trees to generate the key pair, thereby reducing the large key storage requirement. Although this increases computation and communication overhead, it significantly decreases storage space usage. Additionally, we devise a simple yet efficient re-keying mechanism for our scheme.
