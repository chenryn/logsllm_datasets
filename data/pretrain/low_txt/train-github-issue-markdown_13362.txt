On December 18, 2012, the AWS `us-east-1` region experienced an outage that affected the `DescribeInstances` and `DescribeTags` APIs. This, in turn, impacted our two independent clusters operating in the region, as the Kubelet AWS clustering mechanisms rely on the `DescribeInstances` API. However, networking was unaffected, and the master and nodes could still communicate without any issues.

I propose that such an AWS failure should not bring down a cluster. The relevant Kubelet log message is as follows:
```
Error updating node status, will retry: failed to get node address from cloud provider: no instances found for name: ip- _-_ - _-_.ec2.internal
```

There are several related issues that need to be addressed to ensure that Kubernetes is not unnecessarily vulnerable to this type of outage. I am filing this issue to highlight these concerns.

- #17643: Use private IP instead of local hostname for AWS
- #18525: We shouldn't use node names as addresses

**Incident Details from [AWS Status Page](http://status.aws.amazon.com/):**

- **1:02 PM PST:** We are investigating elevated latencies and error rates for the `DescribeInstances` and `DescribeTags` APIs in the `us-east-1` region. Customers may observe elevated error rates or missing tags for instances in the AWS Management Console.
- **1:44 PM PST:** We have identified the root cause of the elevated latencies and error rates for the `DescribeInstances` and `DescribeTags` APIs and are currently working to resolve the issue. Customers may observe elevated error rates or missing tags for instances in the AWS Management Console.
- **3:03 PM PST:** Between 12:30 PM and 2:44 PM PST, we experienced elevated latencies and error rates for the `DescribeInstances` and `DescribeTags` APIs. During this period, customers may have observed elevated error rates and missing tags for instances in the AWS Management Console. However, instances continued running normally. Tags requested during this period are now visible. The issue has been resolved, and the service is operating normally.
