### Abstract

Using DNS data collected through active DNS measurements, we investigated the extent of co-hosting in the current web and its implications for the privacy benefits offered by Encrypted Server Name Indication (ESNI). By quantifying these benefits using k-anonymity, we found that the majority of popular websites (approximately half of all domains studied) will gain only a modest privacy benefit (k < 500). Websites with higher k-anonymity values (k > 500) are mostly less popular and hosted by smaller providers. Additionally, about 20% of the websites will not gain any privacy benefit due to their one-to-one mapping between domain name and hosting IP address.

We hope our findings will raise awareness about the remaining efforts required to ensure meaningful privacy benefits from ESNI deployment. In the meantime, privacy-conscious website owners may consider hosting services provided by companies with a high ratio of co-hosted domains per IP address and highly dynamic domain-to-IP mappings.
