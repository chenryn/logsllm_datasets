### Future Work
As part of our future work, we plan to explore additional pattern features, such as "pattern lengths," and design other types of password composition policies for pattern-based authentication.

### Appendix B: Visualization of Authentication Time for the Online User Study
Figure 11 visually compares the authentication time results between all the policies based on the data collected through the online study. All policies, except for Random, showed similar authentication times.

### Appendix C: Top 20 Most Likely Used Patterns in SysPal and Original Policies
We used the 3-gram Markov model to find the top 20 most likely used patterns in the SysPal policies and the Original policy. Figures 12, 13, 14, and 15 show the results.

These results indicate that even when SysPal policies are in place, users still tend to choose patterns that are relatively easy to draw.

**Table XIV: Number of Overlapped Patterns Among Each Policy**

| **Policy** | **Original** | **1-Point** | **2-Point** | **3-Point** |
|------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Original** | -            | 7 (35%)     | 7 (35%)     | 9 (40%)     |
| **1-Point**  | 7 (35%)      | -           | 11 (55%)    | 8 (40%)     |
| **2-Point**  | 7 (35%)      | 11 (55%)    | -           | 12 (60%)    |
| **3-Point**  | 9 (40%)      | 8 (40%)     | 12 (60%)    | -           |

**Figures:**
- **Figure 12:** Top 20 most likely used patterns in Original.
- **Figure 13:** Top 20 most likely used patterns in 1-Point.
- **Figure 14:** Top 20 most likely used patterns in 2-Point.
- **Figure 15:** Top 20 most likely used patterns in 3-Point.

### Appendix D: Responses of Participants in the Lab Study
After participating in the lab study for a day, participants were asked several survey questions. First, we asked, "How difficult was it for you to remember your pattern?" (Q2 in Table II). Most participants answered that it was easy to set up their patterns (93.3% for Original, 92.3% for 1-Point, 81.3% for 2-Point, respectively).

We also asked Q3 in Table II. Out of the 44 participants, 16 responded that they used shapes that are "easy to generate" or "easy to draw." These results were consistent with those observed in the online study (see Section IV-G).
