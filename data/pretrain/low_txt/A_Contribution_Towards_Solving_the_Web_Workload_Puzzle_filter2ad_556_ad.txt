### Analysis of Intra-Session Characteristics

The analysis of the intra-session characteristics, including session length in time, number of requests per session, and bytes transferred per session, reveals several key insights:

1. **Consistency Between Methods**: The LLCD plot and Hill estimator generally provide consistent results.
2. **Modeling with Distributions**: The curvature test indicates that the intra-session parameters can be well-modeled using both Pareto and lognormal distributions.
3. **Sensitivity to Tail Index**: The results of the curvature test for the Pareto distribution are somewhat sensitive to the estimated values of the tail index and the simulated sample of the Pareto distribution.
4. **Statistical Distinction**: The difficulty in statistically distinguishing between Pareto and lognormal distributions is attributed to the small number of observations in the extreme tail.
5. **Heavy-Tailed Behavior**: Under the Pareto model, some intervals exhibit heavy-tailed behavior for intra-session characteristics.

### Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we present a rigorous statistical analysis of request-level and session-level Web workloads based on data from four real Web servers. Our objectives include developing a comprehensive FULL-Web model and identifying specific limitations associated with methods used for establishing long-range dependence and heavy-tailed behavior.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Long-Range Dependence**: All Web servers considered in this study have long-range dependent request arrival processes. Unlike previous studies, we tested the stationarity of the request-based time series and eliminated trend and periodicity before studying long-range dependence, showing that not accounting for these factors leads to overestimating the level of long-range dependence.
2. **Piecewise Poisson Process**: We demonstrate that the piecewise Poisson process with fixed 1-hour or 10-minute rates is not suitable for modeling the request arrival process.
3. **Session-Based Workload**: We provide a comprehensive model of session-based Web workload, which has not been extensively studied. We show that the Web session arrival process is long-range dependent for all servers, unlike TELNET and FTP traffic.
4. **Intra-Session Characteristics**: We analyze several intra-session characteristics, such as session length in time, number of requests per session, and bytes transferred per session. We use multiple methods (LLCD plot, Hill plot, and curvature test) to examine whether these characteristics follow heavy-tailed distributions.

**Future Work:**
Despite significant research efforts, several challenges remain to be addressed in future work. This comprehensive model contributes to a better understanding of Web workloads and highlights areas for further investigation.
