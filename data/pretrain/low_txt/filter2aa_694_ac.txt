## clientlessTGXf (New, Xmas '14!)
- **Introduction:**
  - **Making good on the ASCII threat:**
    - TGXf is a Transport Protocol at Layer 4.
    - Datagram Protocols at Layer 3 could include:
      - Graphics: Pixels, Images (e.g., F500 logos)
      - Text: Letters, Words, Phrases
  - **Proof of Concept (PoC) published in December:**
    - Uses text letters to enable clientless access.
    - Minimal server-side Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
    - Demonstrates the futility of QR code detection.

## clientlessTGXf from BASH
- **Terminal Setup:**
  - Monospace Bold font at 16pt, black text on white background.
  - About 300 bytes of script (counter+data, FD3).

```bash
IFS="" ; LANG=C ; c=0 ; while read -s -u 3 -d '' -r -n 1 i ; do
  printf -v b "%i" "'$i" ; 
  echo " $((($c&128)>>7))$((($c&64)>>6))$((($c&32)>>5))$((($c&16)>>4))$((($c&8)>>3))$((($c&4)>>2))$((($c&2)>>1))$(($c&1))  $((($b&128)>>7))$((($b&64)>>6))$((($b&32)>>5))$((($b&16)>>4))$((($b&8)>>3))$((($b&4)>>2))$((($b&2)>>1))$(($b&1))" ; 
  ((c++)) ; 
  (($c==256)) && c=0 ; 
  sleep 0.005 ; 
done
```

## clientlessTGXf & HDMI Capture
- **Capture (1kbps):**
  - **HDMI Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):**
    - AverMedia Game Capture II (with remote control)
    - Up to 1920x1080x30fps captured to MP4 on USB Mass Storage
- **Recovery (100bps):**
  - Data recovered from MP4 file by Linux application.

## clientlessTGXf in the Red Room
- **USB HDD and Red Room Protocols:**
  - **Device Entry:**
    - Must be blanked (except for firmware).
    - Should not have a problem getting capture equipment into the Red Room.
  - **Device Exit:**
    - Must be blanked (except for firmware).
    - Will have a problem bringing back the USB mass storage with MP4.

## Hiding USB keys?
- **Creative Solutions:**
  - Captain Koons says “be creative”...

## clientlessTGXf Upload
- **Native 1920x1080 HDMI capture with clientlessTGXf BASH upload.**

## clientlessTGXf Download
- **Decoding TGXf video stream to disk as original file.**

## TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION 3
- **Engineering a faster Proof of Concept.**

## highspeedTGXf (New, Today!)
- **Introduction:**
  - **Making good on the PIXEL threat:**
    - TGXf updated Transport Protocol at Layer 4.
    - CRC32 per Frame/Packet.
    - Datagram Protocol at Layer 3 is pixels.
  - **HTML5 canvas and JavaScript:**
    - hsTGXf PoC (published today).
    - Uses ~20k of JavaScript to enable clientless access.
    - Again, minimal server-side IOCs.
    - Demonstrates the futility of targeting a specific implementation.

## hsTGXf & HDMI Capture
- **Capture (1.3Mbps @ 2FPS, 1BPP):**
  - **HDMI MITM:**
    - AverMedia Game Capture II (with remote control)
    - Up to 1280x720x60fps captured to MP4 on USB Mass Storage
  - **Demo 1240x650x2fps:**
    - 100,750 bytes per frame
  - **Recovery:**
    - Data recovered from MP4 file by Linux application.

## highspeedTGXf “client”
- **Uploading the HTML5 and JavaScript client via keyboard.**

## highspeedTGXf Upload
- **Native 1280x720 HDMI capture with web browser upload.**

## hsTGXf Download
- **Decoding 1.3Mbps TGXf video stream to disk as original file.**

## hsTGXf & HDMI Capture
- **Capture (4.7Mbps @ 8FPS, 1BPP):**
  - **HDMI MITM:**
    - Black Magic Design DeckLink Mini Recorder
    - Up to 1280x720x60fps captured to local SATA HDD
  - **Demo 1240x650x8fps:**
    - 100,750 bytes per frame
  - **Recovery:**
    - Data recovered from AVI file (YUV) by Linux application.

## Architecture
- **Impact on Enterprise Architecture.**

## Architectural Analysis
- **Human versus Machine:**
  - Leaving out the PPP example, no variation in access was granted to the user.
  - TCXf can only type and read what the user can.
- **Distinct Properties of Delta:**
  - **Volume:** Transfer rate in bits per second or number of bits at rest.
  - **Accuracy:** Of data transferred or stored.
  - **Structure:** Of the data transferred.
  - **Utility:** Of the over-arching capability.

## The Problem? Legal
- **Use vs. Disclosure (Australian Privacy Act):**
  - An Australian organisation (APP entity) that holds personal information must ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles.
  - Personal information is disclosed when the Australian organisation releases the subsequent handling of the information from its effective control.
  - The reasonable steps include implementing strategies to manage ICT Security, data breaches, and regular monitoring and review.
  - **Question:** What's a reasonable monitoring step?

## History – Lampson, 1973
- **“A note on the Confinement Problem”:**
  - Enforcement: The supervisor must ensure that a confined program's input to covert channels conforms to the caller's specifications.
  - A cheaper alternative is to bound the capacity of the covert channels.

## History – DoD 1983-2002
- **Trusted Computer Security Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC):**
  - **Performance:**
    - Covert channel bandwidth exceeding 100 bits per second is considered high.
    - Take note: TGXf v1f1 = 80bps; TGXf v1f2 = 160bps; BASH TGXf example = v1f5.
    - HDMI = 1080 x 1920 x 24bit x 24fps = 150MBps (> 1Gbps).
  - **Acceptability:**
    - Covert channels with maximum bandwidths of less than one bit per second are acceptable in most environments.
    - It is possible to audit their use without adversely affecting system performance.

## Punch-line – Use and Off-shore
- **The new equilibrium:**
  - Use vs. Disclosure (HIPAA, FISMA, etc.): Functionally identical (Display = Upload).
  - Off-shoring / Right-Sourcing / Best-shoring: If you like your data to be yours alone, it is not currently, and is unlikely to ever be, “safe”.
  - **Question:** How many bps data loss is "too many" to accept?
