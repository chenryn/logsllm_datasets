## ABSTRACT

The ACM Workshop on Digital Identity Management (DIM) has evolved over the past decade into one of the most significant events in the field of identity management. Initially, it was a community with a predominantly technical focus, but it has since developed into an interdisciplinary workshop where a vibrant, interactive community discusses identity topics from various perspectives, including technical, sociological, economic, legal, and psychological angles. The primary goal of this workshop is to share the latest findings, identify key challenges, inspire debates, and foster collaboration between industry and academia towards interoperable identity service infrastructures.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

"Identity at the crossroads" is the central theme of DIM 2013. While identity management has become a standard method for authentication in the digital world, many of its facets remain poorly understood. Key discussions include identifying optimal solutions for different application areas, promoting positive aspects for individuals and society while mitigating negative effects, and translating research results into practical applications.

At the same time, the environment of our digital lives and identity management systems is rapidly changing:

- **Mobile and Social Internet:** In October 2012, the number of smartphones in use exceeded 1 billion and is projected to double by 2015 [1]. Facebook has also surpassed the 1 billion user mark [2].
- **Identity Federation Systems:** We are seeing the adoption of identity federation systems and other digital identity platforms, such as Google Accounts and Facebook Connect, which enable single sign-on for multiple applications.
- **Technological Advances:** There have been significant improvements in identity management technologies, particularly in attribute-based credential systems, cryptography, and privacy-preserving or privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) [3, 4].
- **Government Initiatives:** Governments worldwide are proposing eID solutions that support privacy mechanisms and integrate government-issued identity credentials into identity federation ecosystems.
- **Emerging Technologies:** Advances in technology and operating environments, such as social networks, mobile devices, smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and wearable computing (e.g., Google Glass, iWatch), are impacting social habits and individual behavior. These developments are often accompanied by news reports on privacy violations and surveillance, raising questions about their societal impact.

Identity is at a critical juncture. It remains an open question how identity technologies will affect societies, especially in the context of mobile computing, social network services, cloud data processing, comprehensive monitoring, and emerging technologies like ubiquitous computing and cyber-physical systems. Will these technologies make users' lives easier, or will they compromise their privacy?

We believe that the ACM Digital Identity Management workshop series must address these issues comprehensively, covering foundational technologies such as cryptography and integration with eID systems, investigating technological and architectural challenges, and exploring the social impact of identity management. This year's workshop aims to cover these areas with a program featuring experts from various fields of identity.

## 2. WORKSHOP FORMAT

The DIM 2013 workshop will be a full-day event, beginning with a keynote by Claudia Díaz from KU Leuven on privacy-enhancing technologies and their role in identity management. The day will feature four sessions with accepted full and short papers, covering a range of topics from cryptographic foundations to socio-psychological findings. In the afternoon, a panel discussion will explore eIDs and their development from different perspectives. All participants are invited to contribute to shaping the future of identity, whether through research or the deployment of better identity management solutions.

## 3. WORKSHOP CONTRIBUTIONS

We have organized the eight full papers and three short papers into four groups. Following the keynote on privacy-enhancing technologies, the "Cryptographic Methods" session will delve into components that support privacy and security features in identity management systems. Papers include "Universally Composable Adaptive Oblivious Transfer (with Access Control) from Standard Assumptions," "A Secure Channel for Attribute-Based Credentials," and "UbiKiMa: Ubiquitous Authentication Using a Smartphone, Migrating from Passwords to Strong Cryptography."

The second session, "Human Factors and Socio-Economic Aspects," will focus on user acceptance and the employment of identity-related functionality. Contributions include "A Comparison of Users’ Perceptions of and Willingness to Use Google, Facebook, and Google+ Single-Sign-On Functionality," "Taboos and Desires of the UK Public for Identity Management in the Future; General Findings from Two Survey Games," and "Probing Identity Management – Preliminary Findings."

The third session, "Security Considerations," will discuss potential attacks, countermeasures, and improvements to existing systems. Papers include "Geo-Location Based QR-Code Authentication Scheme to Defeat Active Real-Time Phishing Attack," "Towards Standardizing Trusted Evidence of Identity," and "Reachability Analysis for Role-Based Administration of Attributes."

The final session, "eIDs and Identity Management," will mix contributions from various disciplines. After a presentation on a technical approach for an eID architecture in "Options for Integrating eID and SAML," the perspective of citizens will be highlighted in "Federated Identity to Access e-Government Services – Are Citizens Ready for This?" The findings from these papers will be discussed in the concluding panel on the future of eIDs and identity management.
