### Potential Vulnerabilities and Mitigation Strategies for Zune’s Content Blocking Mechanism

#### Introduction
The Zune, a portable media player, allows users to share content with nearby devices. However, the current blocking mechanism is vulnerable to several types of attacks, which can be exploited by malicious users to bypass the intended privacy and security features. This document outlines these vulnerabilities and proposes potential solutions.

#### Attack Scenarios

1. **Name Spoofing**
   - **Scenario**: Before sending inappropriate content to Alice, Bob can scan his nearby community, find a nearby Zune named "CharlieZune," and rename his own Zune to "CharlieZune." If Bob sends the inappropriate content and then turns off his wireless, Alice might block the real "CharlieZune" instead.
   - **Mitigation**: The Zune should record the specific device that sent the content, allowing Alice to block the actual sender even if they are not currently nearby.

2. **Fake MAC Addresses**
   - **Scenario**: The Zune's neighbor discovery process and blocking mechanism rely on 802.11 probe-responses and MAC addresses. Using a Linux laptop, Bob can spoof MAC addresses to trick Alice into thinking she has blocked BobZune when she has not.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement a more robust authentication mechanism that goes beyond just MAC addresses. For example, using digital signatures or other cryptographic methods to verify the identity of the sender.

3. **Post-Blocking Privacy**
   - **Scenario**: Even after Alice blocks BobZune, Bob can still detect Alice's presence unless she turns off her Zune's wireless capability entirely, which would prevent her from sharing any media.
   - **Mitigation**: Enhance the blocking mechanism to also prevent the detection of the blocked user's presence. This could involve using temporary, non-persistent identifiers or implementing a more sophisticated privacy-preserving protocol.

#### Improving User Control

- **Buddy List Approach**: One natural method to protect against unsolicited content is to adopt a "buddy list" system, where only known and trusted users can send content. This approach, however, conflicts with the Zune's goal of facilitating ad hoc interactions with strangers.
- **Enhanced Blocking Mechanism**: A simple solution is to record which Zune sent the specific media and allow the user to block the sender even if they are not currently nearby. This requires careful consideration to avoid circumvention through MAC address rewriting.
- **Secure Hardware Module**: In a homogeneous environment with secure hardware, the hardware can control what information is shared and ensure that some information (like unique identifiers) is not mutable by the user. This can help in managing blocking and privacy.

#### Challenges

- **Privacy in Social Networks**: While there has been significant research on controlling private information in social networks, much of it focuses on complex relationships like boss/spouse/friend. The Zune presents a different scenario where the key application is sharing content with strangers, making blocking challenging.
- **Heterogeneous Environment**: Solving the problem in a heterogeneous environment with devices from different manufacturers is particularly challenging. Possible solutions include restricted behavior on secure hardware and symmetric key agreement using anonymous public keys signed with group signature schemes.

#### Conclusions

- **Privacy and Security in UbiComp Products**: Despite research and public awareness, many commercial UbiComp products, including the Zune, do not provide strong levels of privacy protection and do not put the user in control of their private information.
- **Information Leakage**: Our analysis of the encrypted SlingBox stream shows that transmission characteristics can cause information leakage, putting users' privacy at risk.
- **Persistent Identifiers**: Persistent identifiers in the Nike+iPod Sport Kit and Zune can reveal user presence. These should be replaced with privacy-preserving mechanisms in future devices.
- **Design Considerations**: Interface design and technology choices can take control away from consumers and give it to malicious users. Privacy must be designed into all levels of the protocol stack.
