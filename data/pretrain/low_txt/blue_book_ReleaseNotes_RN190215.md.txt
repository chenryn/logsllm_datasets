## 1902 Sprint Release Update

During the 1902 sprint, we initiated the migration from the AzureRM module to the Az-* module. This process has taken longer than anticipated due to several issues with the Az-* cmdlets.

We will continue our efforts to resolve these issues and stabilize the module in the 1903 sprint. Our goal is to release a combined 1902 and 1903 update by mid-March.
