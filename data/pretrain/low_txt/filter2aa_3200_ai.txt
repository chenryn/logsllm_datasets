- **FY 2003**: $76
- **FY 2004**: $76
- **FY 2005**: $76

**State Interoperable Communications: DHS-Funded Activities (May 2006)**

In both the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program (LETPP) and Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), similar expenses were prioritized. These included:
- **$2M (LETPP)** for replacing outdated VHF transceivers.
- **$2.8M (UASI)** for wide-area seamless roaming coverage.
- **$2.4M (UASI)** to ensure the City of North Las Vegas is compatible with other state and local entities.

For FY 2005, although the number and cost of interoperable radio equipment purchases were lower, several significant projects were still funded in southern Nevada:
- **$1.8M (SHSP)** for the City of Boulder City to achieve interoperability with surrounding jurisdictions by upgrading their old VHF system to an APCO 25 compliant 800 MHz system.
- **$700K (SHSP)** for continuing microwave expansion projects in the southern region.

Additionally, numerous smaller communities used their funding to improve and/or upgrade their communications systems.

### New Hampshire State Summary

**Interoperable Communications Spending (in Millions)**
- **FY 2003**: $0.00
- **FY 2004**: $15.059
- **FY 2005**: $5.968
- **Total**: $21.027

**State Interoperable Communications: DHS-Funded Activities (May 2006)**

**Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives**:
- **FY 2004**: $11.2 million for statewide interoperable communications upgrades.
- **FY 2005**: $4.5 million for statewide multi-discipline interoperable communications upgrades.

**Summary**:
Interoperable communications is the top priority in New Hampshire. Both the state and local entities have invested the majority of their grant and training (G&T) funding into a statewide interoperability project. Modeled after the successful LAWNET program, which created statewide interoperability for law enforcement, the current project aims to integrate fire and EMS into the system, creating statewide interoperability among all three disciplines.

### New Jersey State Summary

**Interoperable Communications Spending (in Millions)**
- **FY 2003**: $0.093
- **FY 2004**: $24.202
- **FY 2005**: $11.541
- **Total**: $35.836

**State Interoperable Communications: DHS-Funded Activities (May 2006)**

**New Jersey Interoperability Communications System (NJICS)**:
The NJICS is a statewide communication system comprising specific interoperable communication assets in each of New Jersey's five regions. These assets include:
- Radio cache radios
- Interconnect switches
- Tactical interoperability channels
- Region-wide interoperability channels

Using the NJICS, municipal, county, state, and federal public safety agencies can achieve interoperability via the radios they currently own.

**Enhancements Using G&T Funding (SHSP & UASI)**:
- Regional Central Dispatch
- Regional tactical interoperability channels
- Over 2,000 radio cache radios distributed throughout the state
- At least 24 radio cache radios at each county Office of Emergency Management (OEM) statewide
- Uniformly preprogrammed radio caches with all interoperability channels
- 21 interconnect switches for tactical operations
- Direct interconnect to NYC agencies (NYFD, NYPD, NYOEM)

**Specific to Rep. Pascrell's District (Essex and Passaic Counties)**:
Rep. Pascrell's district falls within New Jersey's UASI region, which includes Morris, Hudson, Bergen, Union, Essex, and Passaic counties. The NJICS in the UASI region is the most developed and serves as a model for other regions.

**Source**: 2004 and 2005 BSIR (December 2005). Grant Programs Included: CCP, LETPP, SHSP, UASI, TSP, EMPG, MMRS, BZPP, and TSGP.

The State of New York has committed $2.05 billion over the next 20 years to engineer, deploy, manage, and operate a SAFECOM P-25 compliant, IP-addressable wireless voice and data communications network. Construction and development are underway, with various regions becoming operational by March 2007. All regions will be operational by 2010.

- **State Agencies**: Required to migrate their LMR communications systems to the new network as each region is built.
- **Local, County, Tribal Public Safety, and Public Safety Entities**: Participation is voluntary, and the level of interoperability desired will determine the amount of IP-addressable communications equipment needed.
- **Funding**: SHSP funding is being utilized to offset some local purchase costs during the grant years.

**Significant Transition Planning**:
- Fleet mapping
- Operational consolidation
- Training programs for each interoperable partner

**NYS Investment**: $2.05 billion for building, maintaining, and administering the statewide infrastructure and network.
