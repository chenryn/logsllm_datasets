## Monetization of Social Networks
### How Do Social Networks Make Money?
- **User Profiles:** The more information you share, the more valuable your profile becomes.
- **Targeted Advertising:** Advertisers pay for access to specific demographics.
- **Selling Demographic Information:** User data is a valuable commodity.
- **Privacy Policies:** Often vague or misleading, allowing for extensive data collection.

## Trust and Exploitation
### Trust is Everything
- **Foundation of Social Networks:** Trust is essential for social networks to function.
- **Exploitation by Attackers:** Cybercriminals leverage trust relationships to carry out attacks.

### Fake Profiles
- **Identity Verification:** Who is behind the account? Bots are widespread and easy to create.
- **User Verification Failures:** Social networks often fail to verify user identities effectively.
- **Connection Validation:** Connections are often based on other "friends," making it easy for fake profiles to infiltrate.

## Privacy Concerns
### Sharing Personal Information
- **Innocent Posts:** Even seemingly harmless posts can be used for password reset questions.
- **Corporate Espionage:** Social network information is highly valuable for penetration tests and large-scale information leaks.

### Default Privacy Settings
- **Wide Open:** Default settings are often permissive.
- **Control Availability:** Facebook has good privacy controls, but many users are unaware of them or do not use them.
- **Family and Friends:** Are they aware of and using these controls?

## Security Concerns
### Malware and Spam
- **Top Target for Malware:** Social networks are a primary target for malware, spam, and disinformation.
- **XSS, CSRF, and More:** These vulnerabilities are frequently exploited.

### Twitter Clickjacking & XSS
- **Koobface Revisited:** Recycled exploits that still work due to trust exploitation.

### Social Network Bots
- **Delivery via API:** Automated tools and scripts, such as n0tab0t and Realboy, are used to deliver bots.
- **Browser-Based Bots:** JavaScript and other technologies can be used to hook browsers.
- **Frameworks:** Tools like BeEF, BrowserRider, and Anehta are available for this purpose.

### SocNet Delivery
- **Embedded Applications:** Can insert JavaScript and redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Why Allow This?** Popular games like Mafia Wars demonstrate the ease of embedding malicious code.

## Information Collection
### Server-Side Data Gathering
- **Information is Power:** Access to data is key, and social networks are rich with it.
- **Connecting the Dots:** Third-party apps help connect and exploit this information.

### Third-Party Apps
- **Access to Everything:** These apps have broad permissions and can collect extensive data.
- **APIs for All:** Both MySpace and Facebook provide APIs that allow for deep integration and data collection.

### Social Butterfly
- **Third-Party Application:** Runs on attacker-controlled servers and collects data from users across different sites.
- **TOS Violations:** There is a fine line between legitimate and illegitimate use of these apps.

## Prevention
### Strategies for Protection
- **User Education:** Educate users about the risks and best practices.
- **Opt-In Models:** End the current opt-in model for developers.
- **API Control:** Better control over API usage.
- **Account Verification:** Improve user verification processes.
