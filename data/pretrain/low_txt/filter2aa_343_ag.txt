### Mac OS X Server and Kerberos Single Sign-On

Starting with Mac OS X Server version 10.3, the following services do not require any additional configuration for single sign-on (SSO) or Kerberos:

- Login window
- Mail service
- FTP
- AFP service
- SSH

These services are "Kerberized" by default, whether they are running or not, on any server that is an Open Directory master or has joined one.

### Setting Up an Open Directory Master for SSO and Kerberos

To enable SSO and Kerberos authentication on your network, you can set up an Open Directory master. This can be done during the initial configuration after installing Mac OS X Server version 10.3 or later. If your server is already configured with a different Open Directory role, you can change it to an Open Directory master using Server Admin.

An Open Directory master server requires no additional configuration to support SSO and Kerberos for all Kerberized services it provides. It can also support SSO and Kerberos for Kerberized services on other servers in the network, provided those servers are set up to join the Open Directory master.

For detailed instructions, refer to:
- "Setting Up an Open Directory Master" on page 56
- "Delegating Authority to Join an Open Directory Master for SSO and Kerberos" on page 62
- "Joining a Server to an Open Directory Master for SSO and Kerberos" on page 63

### Delegating Authority to Join an Open Directory Master for SSO and Kerberos

Using Server Admin, you can delegate the authority to join a server to an Open Directory master for SSO and Kerberos authentication. You can delegate this authority to one or more user accounts on a server. The delegated user accounts must have a password type of Open Directory and must reside in the LDAP directory of the Open Directory master. The server for which you are delegating authority must run Mac OS X Server version 10.3 or later.

If you need to delegate authority for multiple servers, repeat the procedure for each one.

**Important Note:** If a delegated administrator's account is deleted and recreated on the target server, the new account will not have the authority to join the Kerberos server. As a precaution, delegate authority to at least two accounts on the target server. One account can belong to a network administrator (an administrator of the Kerberos domain).

#### Steps to Delegate Authority

1. **Open Workgroup Manager:**
   - Ensure the target server has been added to a computer account in the LDAP directory domain of the server from which you are delegating authority.
   - Note the name of the target server in the computer account.

2. **Add the Target Server:**
   - The name of the target server in the computer account corresponds to the name of the server’s computer record in the LDAP directory domain.
   - For instructions on adding the server to a computer account, see the computer accounts chapter of the user management guide.

3. **Open Server Admin:**
   - Select Open Directory for the Open Directory master server in the Computers & Services list.
   - Click Settings, then click General.

4. **Configure Kerberos Record:**
   - Confirm the Role is Open Directory Master.
   - Click Add Kerberos Record and enter the requested information:
     - **Administrator Name:** Enter the name of an LDAP directory administrator on the Open Directory master server.
     - **Administrator Password:** Enter the password of the administrator account.
     - **Configuration Record Name:** Enter the computer record name of the server for which you are delegating authority to join Kerberos.
     - **Delegated Administrators:** Enter the short name or long name for each user account to which you want to delegate authority. Separate multiple names by pressing Return after each name.

### Joining a Server to an Open Directory Master for SSO and Kerberos

Using Server Admin, a server administrator whose user account has the properly delegated authority can join a server to an Open Directory master for SSO and Kerberos authentication. This authority must be delegated in advance by an administrator of the Open Directory master.

#### Steps to Join a Server

1. **Open Server Admin:**
   - Select Open Directory for the target server in the Computers & Services list.
   - Click Settings, then click General.

2. **Confirm and Join:**
   - Confirm the Role is Connected to a Directory System.
   - Click Join Kerberos and enter the name and password of a user account that has been delegated authority for the target server.

### Setting LDAP Options

You can configure several options for LDAP directories of an Open Directory master or replica. Refer to the following sections for more details:

- "Setting the Replication Frequency of an Open Directory Master" (next)
- "Changing the Location of an LDAP Database" on page 64
- "Limiting Search Results for LDAP Service" on page 65
- "Changing the Search Timeout for LDAP Service" on page 65
- "Setting up SSL for LDAP Service" on page 65

### Setting the Replication Frequency of an Open Directory Master

Using Server Admin, you can specify how frequently an Open Directory master updates its replicas with changes to directory and authentication information. The master can update the replicas whenever a change occurs in the master directory domain or on a schedule you specify.

#### Steps to Set Replication Frequency

1. **Open Server Admin:**
   - Select Open Directory for an Open Directory master server in the Computers & Services list.
   - Click Settings, then click General.

2. **Specify Replication Frequency:**
   - Choose between:
     - **Replicate to clients whenever the directory is modified:** Keeps replicas accurate but increases network load. May impair the performance of the master if a replica is connected via a slow network link.
     - **Replicate to clients every __:** Allows you to schedule less frequent updates. Less frequent updates trade accuracy for fewer network connections, which may be desirable if replicas are not on the same LAN as the master.

3. **Click Save.**

### Changing the Location of an LDAP Database

Using Server Admin, you can specify the disk location of the database that stores user records and other information in an LDAP directory domain of an Open Directory master or replica. The LDAP database is usually located on the startup volume but can be on a different local volume.

**Note:** Databases that store authentication information for Open Directory and Kerberos are always located on the startup volume for security purposes, regardless of the LDAP database location.

#### Steps to Change the Location

1. **Open Server Admin:**
   - Select Open Directory for a server that is an Open Directory master or an Open Directory replica in the Computers & Services list.
   - Click Settings, then click Protocols.

2. **Configure LDAP Settings:**
   - Choose LDAP Settings from the Configure pop-up menu.
   - Specify the folder path where you want the LDAP database to be located.

3. **Click Save.**

### Limiting Search Results for LDAP Service

Using Server Admin, you can prevent denial-of-service attacks by limiting the number of search results returned by the server’s shared LDAP directory domain. Limiting the number of search results prevents a malicious user from tying up the server with multiple all-inclusive LDAP search requests.

#### Steps to Set Maximum Search Results

1. **Open Server Admin:**
   - Select Open Directory for a server that is an Open Directory master or an Open Directory replica in the Computers & Services list.
   - Click Settings, then click Protocols.

2. **Configure LDAP Settings:**
   - Choose LDAP Settings from the Configure pop-up menu.
   - Enter the maximum number of search results.

3. **Click Save.**

### Changing the Search Timeout for LDAP Service

Using Server Admin, you can prevent denial-of-service attacks by setting a search timeout interval for the server’s shared LDAP directory domain. Setting a search timeout prevents a malicious user from tying up the server with an exceptionally complex LDAP search request.

#### Steps to Set Search Timeout

1. **Open Server Admin:**
   - Select Open Directory for a server that is an Open Directory master or an Open Directory replica in the Computers & Services list.
   - Click Settings, then click Protocols.

2. **Configure LDAP Settings:**
   - Choose LDAP Settings from the Configure pop-up menu.
   - Specify a search timeout interval.

3. **Click Save.**

### Setting up SSL for LDAP Service

Using Server Admin, you can set up encrypted communications between a shared LDAP directory domain on Mac OS X Server and other servers that connect to the directory domain. You can enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for encrypted LDAP communications and specify the location of the SSL certificate file, key file, and certificate authority (CA) certificate file.

**Note:** SSL communications for LDAP use port 636. If SSL is disabled for LDAP service, communications are sent as clear text on port 389.

#### Steps to Set Up SSL

1. **Open Server Admin:**
   - Select Open Directory for a server that is an Open Directory master or an Open Directory replica in the Computers & Services list.
   - Click Settings, then click Protocols.

2. **Configure LDAP Settings:**
   - Choose LDAP Settings from the Configure pop-up menu.
   - Select Use SSL.
   - Enter the location and name for the SSL Certificate, SSL Key, and CA Certificate. Alternatively, locate these files by clicking the Browse button next to the field.

3. **Click Save.**

### Migrating a Directory Domain From NetInfo to LDAP

You can use Server Admin to migrate a shared NetInfo directory domain to LDAP. The migration process irreversibly replaces the directory domain’s NetInfo back-end database with a Berkeley DB back-end database. After migration, client computers that were configured to use NetInfo to access the directory domain will be able to continue accessing it.

After migration, you can configure DHCP service to provide the migrated directory domain as an LDAP server to client computers with Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server version 10.2 and later that have automatic authentication search policies. Client computers with Mac OS X version 10.3 or Mac OS X Server version 10.3 can automatically switch to using LDAP to access the migrated directory domain.

The migration process can store auto-switch information in the directory domain. When Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server version 10.3 and later use NetInfo to access a directory domain that has been migrated to LDAP, they pick up the auto-switch information from the directory domain and reconfigure themselves to access the directory domain using LDAP henceforth.

When you set up migration, you can specify a date on which NetInfo access to the migrated directory domain will be disabled. Alternatively, you can disable NetInfo access at any time by clicking a button. After NetInfo is disabled, client computers cannot switch automatically to LDAP.

The migration process moves all standard record types and data types from the NetInfo database to an LDAP database. Custom record types or data types in the NetInfo directory domain are not moved to the LDAP database.

Migration to LDAP does not change how user passwords are validated, except for passwords validated by Authentication Manager. Passwords that were validated by a Password Server continue to be validated by the same Password Server. If any user accounts in the NetInfo domain used Authentication Manager for password validation, the migration process converts them to have a password type of Open Directory. An administrator can change the password type of any migrated user account to Open Directory so that the user account can take advantage of SSO and Kerberos authentication.

**Important Note:** Do not click the Disable NetInfo button by accident. Clicking Disable NetInfo immediately disables NetInfo access to the directory domain. You cannot undo this change. After disabling NetInfo, all computers that need to connect to the directory domain must be configured to do so using LDAP.

#### Steps to Migrate a Directory Domain

1. **Open Server Admin:**
   - Select Open Directory for an Open Directory master server in the Computers & Services list.
   - Click Settings, then click Protocols.

2. **Configure NetInfo Migration:**
   - Choose NetInfo Migration from the Configure pop-up menu.
   - Click Migrate and set the migration options:
     - **Administrator short name:** The short name of an administrator account in the server’s local directory domain that you want to have copied to the migrated LDAP directory.
     - **Administrator password:** The password for the administrator account whose short name you entered.
     - **Kerberos realm name:** By convention, the Kerberos realm name is the same as the server’s DNS name but in all uppercase letters.
     - **Search base (optional):** The search base suffix for the migrated LDAP directory.
     - **Switch existing NetInfo clients to LDAP:** Enables client computers with Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server version 10.3 to automatically reconfigure themselves to access the migrated directory domain using LDAP instead of NetInfo.
     - **Shut down NetInfo Server at 2:00 am on __:** Enter a date when you want to end NetInfo access to the migrated directory domain.

3. **Click OK to begin migration.**
   - The migration process can take some time.

4. **After migration finishes:**
   - Set up DHCP service to provide the LDAP server’s address to client computers with automatic search policies.

### Switching Directory Access From NetInfo to LDAP

After migrating a shared directory domain of Mac OS X Server from NetInfo to LDAP, some clients will switch to LDAP automatically, but you may need to configure other clients to use LDAP and reconfigure DHCP service.

- **Computers with an automatic authentication search policy** get the address of their directory server from DHCP service. Therefore, you need to change DHCP service to supply the address of the migrated LDAP directory’s server.
- **Computers with Mac OS X Server version 10.3** that were using NetInfo to access the migrated directory domain can switch to LDAP automatically. Automatic switching must be enabled when the directory domain is migrated from NetInfo to LDAP. Mac OS X can no longer switch automatically to LDAP after you disable NetInfo on the migrated directory domain’s server.
- **Manually switch a Mac OS X computer to LDAP** using Directory Access.
- **Configure the computer to use an automatic authentication search policy.** In this case, you also need to configure DHCP service to supply the migrated LDAP directory server’s address to its clients.
- **Alternatively, set up an LDAPv3 configuration on the computer** and add this LDAPv3 configuration to the computer’s custom authentication search policy.
- **After you disable NetInfo on the server, ensure DHCP is not supplying the server’s address for NetInfo binding.**

For more information, see:
- "Migrating a Directory Domain From Netinfo to LDAP" on page 66
- "Setting Up the Authentication and Contacts Search Policies" on page 87
- "Accessing LDAP Directories" on page 90
- The DHCP chapter in the network services administration guide.

### Disabling NetInfo After Migrating to LDAP

If none of the client computers on your network needs NetInfo access to a directory domain that has been migrated to LDAP, you can use Server Admin to disable NetInfo. You can manually disable the NetInfo server even if you scheduled a shutdown of the NetInfo server while setting up the migration to LDAP.

**Important Note:** Do not disable NetInfo prematurely. After disabling NetInfo, all computers that need to connect to the directory domain must be configured to do so using LDAP.

#### Steps to Disable NetInfo

1. **Open Server Admin:**
   - Select Open Directory for an Open Directory master server in the Computers & Services list.
   - Click Settings, then click Protocols.

2. **Configure NetInfo Migration:**
   - Choose NetInfo Migration from the Configure pop-up menu.
   - Click Disable NetInfo.
   - Clicking Disable NetInfo immediately disables NetInfo access to the directory domain. You cannot undo this change.

### Managing User Authentication

The authentication services included with Mac OS X Server do not require any setup, but you can change how each user is authenticated. Mac OS X Server can authenticate users by:

- Using SSO with the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) built into Mac OS X Server
- Using a password stored securely in the Open Directory Password Server database
- Using a shadow password stored as several hashes, including NT and LAN Manager, in a file that only the root user can access
- Using a crypt password stored directly in the user’s account
- Using a non-Apple LDAP server for simple LDAP bind authentication

SSO and Kerberos authentication require minimal setup of Mac OS X Server. The other authentication options require no setup of Mac OS X Server.

You can manage how Mac OS X Server uses the available options to authenticate users. For task descriptions and instructions, see:

- "Composing a Password" on page 72
- "Changing a User’s Password" on page 72
- "Resetting the Passwords of Multiple Users" on page 73
- "Changing the Global Password Policy" on page 74
- "Setting Password Policies for Individual Users" on page 75
- "Changing a User’s Password Type" on page 76
- "Assigning Administrator Rights for Open Directory Authentication" on page 80
- "Exporting and Importing Users Whose Password Type Is Open Directory" on page 81
- "Migrating Passwords to Open Directory Authentication" on page 82

### Composing a Password

The password associated with a user’s account must be entered by the user when they authenticate for login or other services. The password is case sensitive (except for SMB LAN Manager passwords) and is masked on the screen as it is entered. Here are some guidelines for composing a password for Mac OS X Server users:

- A password should contain letters, numbers, and symbols in combinations that won’t be easily guessed by unauthorized users. Passwords should not consist of actual words. Good passwords might include digits and symbols (such as # or $). Use both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Avoid spaces and Option-key combinations.
- Avoid characters that cannot be entered on computers the user will be using or that might require knowing a special keystroke combination to enter correctly on different keyboards and platforms.
- Some network protocols do not support passwords that contain leading spaces, embedded spaces, or trailing spaces.
- A zero-length password is not recommended; Open Directory and some systems (such as LDAP bind) do not support a zero-length password.

For maximum compatibility with computers and services your users might use, use only ASCII characters in passwords.

### Changing a User’s Password

You can use Workgroup Manager to change a user’s password.

#### Steps to Change a User’s Password

1. **Open Workgroup Manager:**
   - Click the Accounts button, then click the User button.
   - Open the directory domain that contains the user account whose password you want to change, and authenticate as an administrator of the domain.
   - To open a directory domain, click the small globe icon above the list of users and choose from the pop-up menu.
   - If the user’s password type is Open Directory, you must authenticate as an administrator whose password type is Open Directory.

2. **Select the Account:**
   - Select the account whose password needs to be changed.
   - Enter a password on the Basic pane, then click Save.

3. **Inform the User:**
   - Tell the user the new password so they can log in.
   - After the user logs in to Mac OS X with the new password, they can change the password by clicking Accounts in System Preferences.

If you change the password of an account whose password type is Open Directory and the account resides in the LDAP directory of an Open Directory replica or master, the change will eventually be synchronized with the master and all its replicas. Mac OS X Server automatically synchronizes changes to Open Directory passwords among a master and its replicas.

### Resetting the Passwords of Multiple Users

You can use Workgroup Manager to simultaneously select multiple user accounts and change them all to have the same password type and the same temporary password.

#### Steps to Change Passwords of Multiple Users

1. **Open Workgroup Manager:**
   - Click the Accounts button, then click the User button.
   - Open the directory domain that contains the user accounts whose passwords you want to change, and authenticate as an administrator of the domain.
   - To open a directory domain, click the small globe icon above the list of users and choose from the pop-up menu.
   - If the user’s password type is Open Directory, you must authenticate as an administrator whose password type is Open Directory.

2. **Select Multiple Accounts:**
   - Select the accounts whose passwords need to be changed.
   - Enter a password on the Basic pane, then click Save.

3. **Inform the Users:**
   - Tell the users the new password so they can log in.
   - After the users log in to Mac OS X with the new password, they can change the password by clicking Accounts in System Preferences.
