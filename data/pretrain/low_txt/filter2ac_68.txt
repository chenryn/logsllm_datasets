**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Office Test

Adversaries may exploit the Microsoft Office "Office Test" Registry key to achieve persistence on a compromised system. This specific Registry key allows a user to specify an arbitrary DLL, which will be executed each time an Office application is launched. The "Office Test" Registry key is believed to be used by Microsoft for loading DLLs during the testing and debugging phases of Office application development. It is important to note that this Registry key is not created by default during a standard Office installation.
