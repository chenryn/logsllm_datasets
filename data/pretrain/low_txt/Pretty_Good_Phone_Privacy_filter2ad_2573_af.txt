### Glossary

- **AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement)**: The process by which the UE and the AUSF exchange information to verify a secret key held by each other, and calculate keys for ciphering and integrity protection of data transmitted between the UE and the network.
- **AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function)**: The control entity that manages signaling between the UE and the core network. It supports functions related to bearer and connection management and manages mobility between gNodeBs.
- **AUSF (Authentication Server Function)**: The entity that holds subscription information to allow or deny access to the network.
- **Diameter**: The authentication, authorization, and accounting protocol used by 4G/5G cellular networks, enabling roaming between modern cellular networks.
- **EIR (Equipment Identity Register)**: A database that stores IMEIs of devices in cellular systems. IMEIs can be white-listed, grey-listed, or black-listed. The EIR allows a device’s identity to be checked for blacklisting.
- **gNodeB (Next Generation NodeB)**: The base station in 5G.
- **GUTI (Globally Unique Temporary Identity)**: A temporary identifier that can be used in lieu of an IMSI to identify a subscriber to the core network.
- **IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity)**: A globally unique, permanent device identifier allocated to each individual mobile device by the manufacturer.
- **IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem)**: The entity that provides voice and messaging services for the network.
- **IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)**: A globally unique identifier associated with each mobile phone subscriber in 4G LTE. It is stored in the SIM inside the phone and sent to the network.
- **MNO (Mobile Network Operator)**: A cellular service provider.
- **MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator)**: A cellular operator that does not necessarily own its own spectrum or all of the network equipment it operates upon. MVNOs run on top of MNO networks.
- **NG-RAN (Next Generation Radio Access Network)**: The network that serves to connect UEs and gNodeBs.
- **NGC (Next Generation Core)**: The core network in 5G. Main logical nodes include the User Plane Function (UPF), Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF), Session Management Function (SMF), and Authentication Server Function (AUSF).
- **PGPP-GW (PGPP Gateway)**: A proposed gateway for PGPP that sits between the UPF and the global Internet, allowing for billing without requiring the user’s identity.
- **RNTI (Radio Network Temporary Identifier)**: A unique identifier for a UE in a given cell, used to connect over layer 2.
- **SIM (Subscriber Identity Module)**: An entity that holds the IMSI, uniquely identifying a subscriber. SIMs are used to authenticate a user to the network.
- **SMF (Session Management Function)**: Supports session management and IP address allocation.
- **SQN (Sequence Number)**: A value stored at the AUSF and the SIM to maintain synchrony between the entities.
- **SS7 (Signaling System 7)**: The protocol standard used by entities on public switched telephone networks to communicate with one another. SS7 is used to set up and tear down voice calls, deliver SMS, etc. It has been largely replaced by Diameter in modern cellular standards.
- **SUCI (Subscription Concealed Identifier)**: A temporary identifier that can be used in lieu of a SUPI to identify a subscriber to the 5G network. The SUCI uses cryptographic primitives to hide the SUPI from eavesdroppers.
- **SUPI (Subscription Permanent Identifier)**: A globally unique identifier associated with each mobile phone subscriber in 5G networks. It is stored in the SIM inside the phone and sent to the network.
- **TA (Tracking Area)**: A tracking area includes one or many gNodeBs. Typically, the UE can move freely within gNodeBs in a tracking area without notifying the AMF with a tracking area update.
- **TAL (Tracking Area List)**: A list of tracking areas stored on the device that the device can enter without triggering a tracking area update.
- **TAP (Transferred Account Procedure)**: A file detailing usage and wholesale charges due to roaming.
- **UE (User Equipment)**: The mobile device that allows a user to access network services, connecting to the UTRAN or E-UTRAN via the radio interface. Commonly understood to be a mobile phone.
- **UPF (User Plane Function)**: The gateway that provides global IP connectivity from the NGC.
