## Prior Work
- **"Derivative Local Admin"** by Justin Warner (@sixdub) - [Link](http://www.sixdub.net/?p=591)
- **Active Directory Control Paths** by Emmanuel Gras and Lucas Bouillot - [GitHub](https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/AD-control-paths)
- **One of the Best AD Security Resources** - [adsecurity.org](https://adsecurity.org/)

## The Current State of Active Directory Domain Privilege Escalation
- **Ubiquity of Active Directory**: Extensive security research has been devoted to Active Directory.
- **Easy Buttons**: While sometimes available, they tend to disappear quickly.
- **Best Tradecraft**: Includes, but does not rely on, easy buttons.

## A Tale of Two Networks
- **Network Comparison**: Highlighting the importance of understanding different network configurations and their vulnerabilities.

## The Concept of “Derivative Local Admin”
- **Definition**: Chaining or linking administrator rights through compromising other privileged accounts.
- **Terminology**: Also known as a “Snowball attack” (coined by Microsoft Research in 2009).
- **Blog Post**: First coined in a blog post by Justin Warner - [Link](http://www.sixdub.net/asdf)

### Example
- **Runaway Nested Groups**: Makes it difficult to determine who the effective admins are on a given system.
- **Forward Escalation**: Chaining privileges to escalate access.
- **Reverse Analysis**: Identifying paths from a compromised account back to higher privileges.
- **Combinatorial Explosion**: The complexity of identifying all possible paths.

### Challenges
- **Scalability**: Does not scale well.
- **Time-Consuming and Tedious**: Manual analysis is extremely time-consuming.
- **Path Identification**: May not identify the shortest or all possible paths.
- **Domain Admin Not Always Necessary**: Limited situational awareness.

## A Crash Course in Graph Theory
- **Graph Components**: Comprised of vertices (nodes) and edges (relationships).
- **Adjacency**: Vertices that share an edge are adjacent.
- **Edge Types**: Directed (one-way) or undirected (bidirectional).
- **Paths**: A set of vertices and edges linking one vertex to another, whether adjacent or not.

### Example
- **Vertices and Edges**: Basic components of a graph.
- **BloodHound Graph Design**: Utilizing graph theory for visualizing and analyzing privilege escalation paths.

## Stealthy Data Collection with PowerView
- **Tool Description**: A pure PowerShell v2.0 tool for domain and network situational awareness.
- **Features**: Self-contained, loadable in memory, part of PowerSploit.
- **Data Collection**: Automates large components of red team tradecraft and collects data for BloodHound.

### Use Cases
- **User Hunting**: Identifying logged-in users on remote machines.
- **Admin Rights Enumeration**: Determining local admin rights on remote machines.
- **GPO Correlation**: Analyzing GPO settings to determine admin rights.
- **Group Membership**: Enumerating group members through LDAP/ADSI searches.

### Bringing It All Together
- **BloodHound Ingestor**: Customized version of PowerView with added functions for data export and ingestion.
- **Capabilities**: No need for admin rights to pull data, direct ingestion into BloodHound.

## The Release of BloodHound
- **Web Interface**: Easy-to-use, intuitive interface for interacting with a graph database.
- **Built With**: Linkurious.js
- **Demo**: Fun capabilities demonstrated by Rohan Vazarkar.

## Closing Remarks and Future Plans
### Future Plans
- **Expand Scope**: Model more elements in the BloodHound graph, including AD object ACLs, GPOs, etc.
- **Continued Research**: Applications of graph theory to Active Directory security.
- **Defense-Centric Capabilities**: Maturing data collection, ingestion, and analysis methods.

### Closing Remarks
- **Improving Defensive Postures**: Attack paths will increasingly rely on environmental misconfigurations and poor implementations of least privilege and admin account hygiene.
- **Graph Theory**: Enables rapid attack path analysis.
- **BloodHound**: A free and open-source tool for Active Directory domain privilege escalation using graph theory.
