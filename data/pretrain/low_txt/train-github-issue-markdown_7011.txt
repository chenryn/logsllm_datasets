I am currently using Neo4j version 1.9.1 and have encountered an issue with the node count displayed in the red bubble, which indicates the number of nodes with a specific relationship. This discrepancy occurs after I select one of the nodes from that bubble.

To illustrate this, I downloaded the Cineast database and navigated to the data browser. I then searched for node 431, which has 14 incoming relationships of type `ACTS_IN`. When I clicked on the red bubble displaying "14" nodes, a pop-up list appeared. I selected node 434 from this list, and after doing so, the node count in the red bubble decreased to 12 instead of the expected 13. Upon re-clicking the red bubble, I confirmed that the list still contains 13 nodes. Therefore, the error lies in the node count display.

Thank you for your attention.
