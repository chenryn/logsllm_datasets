## Abstract
Content delivery systems are a significant component of today's Internet traffic. While they generate substantial revenue for Internet Service Providers (ISPs), the large volume of content delivery traffic also presents a considerable challenge in terms of traffic engineering. The difficulty arises from the immense volume of transfers, and the traffic engineering challenge is due to the distributed nature of most content delivery systems, which perform their own traffic flow optimization using the DNS system. These systems often prioritize user performance but do not consider ISP constraints, leading to a loss of control over a major portion of the ISP's traffic.

To address this issue, we propose a Provider-aided Distance Information System (PaDIS). PaDIS leverages information available only to the ISP to rank client-host pairs based on distance metrics such as delay, bandwidth, and number of hops. Our study shows that more than 70% of the HTTP traffic of a major European ISP can be accessed via multiple different locations. Experiments with various content providers demonstrate that PaDIS can improve download times by up to a factor of four. We also describe a high-performance implementation of PaDIS and its deployment within an ISP.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet has evolved into a platform where users can easily share content through applications such as online social networks, video portals, One-Click Hosters, Web services, wikis, blogs, and P2P file-sharing applications. In terms of volume, multimedia content, including photos, music, and videos, as well as software downloads and updates, are major contributors to Internet traffic. HTTP accounts for more than 50% of the traffic, and it is primarily used for accessing this information. The increase in HTTP traffic is driven by the rise of streaming content and the popularity of One-Click Hosters like rapidshare.com and uploaded.to.

This content is hosted by "Hyper Giants" such as Google, Yahoo, and Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) like Akamai and Limelight. These entities operate a substantial number of data centers and build their own networks. Some researchers argue that the topological structure of the Internet must be redrawn to include these Hyper Giants, along with global transit and backbone networks, as part of the Internet core, potentially leaving ISPs as mere pipe providers to consumers.

Most content delivery architectures rely on a distributed infrastructure to achieve high performance and scalability. They can optimize traffic flows to minimize operational costs while meeting quality of service agreements. However, this may result in sub-optimal content delivery performance for end-users and impose a heavy burden on ISPs. If ISPs change their routing for traffic engineering, the content delivery network may re-optimize, rendering the ISP's traffic engineering choices ineffective.

Despite the availability of diverse hosts for any requested object, ISPs have no control over where users fetch content. However, ISPs have valuable information that can be used to improve overall traffic flow and content delivery performance. This information is not readily available to CDNs, which must infer it via active measurements or client reports. Therefore, we propose using Provider-Aided Distance Information (PaDIS) to improve content delivery, similar to how ISP-P2P collaboration can improve P2P content delivery.

Previous work has shown potential for biasing location choices. For example, we proposed that ISPs offer a service to P2P users, helping them choose "good" neighbors by ranking possible peers. Such traffic localization mechanisms for P2P traffic are currently under discussion within the IETF ALTO working group.

Network-based information is particularly useful for circumventing bottlenecks and handling application flash crowds. By having more control over traffic flows, ISPs can choose servers more intelligently, reducing overall traffic volume and network utilization, and improving user performance.

In this paper, we show that more than half of the total traffic, including dominant HTTP traffic, can be delivered from multiple servers at diverse network locations. We propose deploying PaDIS as a content location recommendation system within the ISP, interfacing with the ISP's DNS to redirect traffic or being contacted directly by the client system. We quantify the content delivery performance improvement when using PaDIS, reporting significant potential for performance improvements.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes application and ISP collaboration based on the observation that content is usually accessible at multiple locations due to the prevalence of distributed content delivery architectures. While there is a risk that content delivery architectures may try to boycott the ISP's choice by no longer exposing multiple locations, ISPs still control access and can use this approach as a negotiation tool.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows:
- **Section 2:** Evidence of host diversity for content delivery.
- **Section 3:** Architecture and deployment of PaDIS.
- **Section 4:** Quantification of content delivery performance improvement using PaDIS.
- **Section 5:** Related work.
- **Section 6:** Conclusion.

## 2. Content Server Diversity
To highlight the potential diversity of hosts from which content can be downloaded, we use passive network traces to identify popular services and active measurements to identify server location diversity.

### 2.1 Residential ISP Traces
Our study is based on three sets of anonymized packet-level observations of residential DSL connections collected at aggregation points within a large European ISP. Our monitoring setup, using Endace monitoring cards, allows us to observe the traffic of more than 20,000 DSL lines. Data anonymization, classification, and protocol-specific header extraction are performed immediately on the secured measurement infrastructure using the Bro NIDS with dynamic protocol detection (DPD).

We use an anonymized 24-hour packet trace collected in March 2010 (MAR10) for detailed analysis of protocol behavior. For longer-term trends, we used Bro's online analysis capabilities to collect an anonymized protocol-specific trace summary (HTTP-14d) spanning two weeks. Additionally, we collected an anonymized 5-day DNS trace (DNS-5d) in February 2010 to understand how hostnames are resolved by different sites. Due to the high volume of traffic and resource-intensive analysis, we gathered the online trace summaries one at a time.

Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the traces, including start date, duration, size, and protocol volume. It is not possible to determine the exact application mix for the protocol-specific traces, but we use full traces to cross-check the general application mix evolution.

#### 2.1.1 Popular Services
Regarding the application mix, Maier et al. [24] find that HTTP, BitTorrent, and eDonkey each contribute significantly to traffic. In MAR10, HTTP alone contributes almost 60% of the overall traffic, while BitTorrent and eDonkey contribute more than 10%. Similar protocol distributions have been observed at different times and other locations of the same ISP, consistent with previous studies.
