**Abstract:**
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) botnets are highly resilient to takedown attempts, which often exploit vulnerabilities in the bots' communication protocols. However, failed takedown attempts can alert botmasters, allowing them to patch their vulnerabilities and thwart subsequent efforts. To mitigate this, takedowns could be evaluated in simulation environments before being executed in the real world. For these simulations to be realistic, it is essential to accurately measure the churn behavior of botnets. This paper discusses potential pitfalls in measuring churn in live P2P botnets and proposes a botnet monitoring framework for uniform data collection and churn measurement.

**1. Introduction**
Botnets are networks of malware-infected machines, known as bots, that can be remotely controlled by attackers, or botmasters, to perform criminal activities such as spam distribution and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Countermeasures against botnets depend significantly on the structure of the Command and Control (C2) channel. While centralized C2 channels are common, they have a single point of failure. To overcome this, botmasters have adopted more resilient, fully distributed P2P botnets, where each bot can disseminate commands.

To successfully attack such botnets, detailed information about their population and interconnectivity is required. Even with sufficient information, takedown attempts are challenging and can fail, potentially alerting botmasters to patch vulnerabilities. Simulators, such as the open-source Botnet Simulation Framework (BSF), offer a solution by allowing the evaluation of takedown approaches in a dynamic environment.

For realistic and accurate simulations, two key components are crucial: 1) the communication protocol and membership management, and 2) the churn behavior of the botnet, i.e., nodes joining and leaving. While the former can be extracted through reverse engineering, the churn behavior must be measured on the live botnet. Accurate measurements are essential as they influence the botnet's topology, resilience, and resistance to monitoring.

This paper aims to discuss the challenges of accurate churn measurements and proposes the Botnet Monitoring Framework (BMF) for uniform data collection across multiple P2P botnets. The collected data can then be used to facilitate accurate simulations of P2P botnets.

**2. Related Work**
In this section, we provide an overview of related work on measuring churn in P2P networks and botnets.

Stutzbach et al. [4] analyzed the characteristics of churn in P2P file-sharing networks, emphasizing the importance of high-speed crawling for accurate measurements. They also found that Weibull distributions fit churn data better than exponential distributions.

Karuppayah [7] provided measurements and Weibull distribution fits for the Sality and ZeroAccess P2P botnets. Although the churn behavior differs between file-sharing and botnet P2P networks, Weibull distributions were suitable for fitting churn in botnets.

Böck et al. [2] presented an algorithm to replicate churn measurements accurately within their botnet simulation framework, highlighting the importance of accurate measurements for replicating churn behaviors in simulators.

Other works [5, 6, 8] have discussed the effects of churn in P2P botnets and the significance of obtaining accurate churn behavior. These studies did not report distribution fits but discussed the impact of churn on measurement accuracy and diurnal patterns. Most of these works used standalone crawlers, sometimes combined with sensors, to measure churn. As we will discuss, such standalone monitoring approaches have limitations.

**3. Common Pitfalls and Proposed Methodology**
In this section, we discuss potential pitfalls in measuring churn on live P2P botnets and introduce an efficient and scalable botnet monitoring framework to address these issues.

**3.1 Pitfalls for Accurate Churn Measurements**
To ensure accurate churn measurements, potential errors in data collection and interpretation must be considered. Stutzbach et al. [4] identified several pitfalls, which we summarize (1-7) and add three new ones (8-10) specific to P2P botnets.

- **P1: Missing Data** - Data must be complete for the period of distribution fitting. Otherwise, missing data will adversely affect the churn measurements of the affected nodes.
- **P2: Biased Peer Selection** - If a subset of peers is selected, they may not represent the entire network, leading to biased results.
