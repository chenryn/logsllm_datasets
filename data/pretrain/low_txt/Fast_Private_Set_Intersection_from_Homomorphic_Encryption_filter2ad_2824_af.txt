### Communication Complexity and Performance Comparison

The communication complexity of our protocol is given by the equation:
\[ Nxsv + k(1.2Ny + s), \]
where:
- \( s = 6 \) is the stash size in cuckoo hashing,
- \( k \approx 444 \) is the width of the pseudorandom code,
- \( v = \lambda + \log_2(NxNy) \) is the size of the OPRF output, and
- \( 1.2 \) is a factor related to cuckoo hashing utilization.

The communication complexity of [PSZ16] follows the same equation but with a smaller \( k \) due to a more optimized oblivious transfer sub-protocol. In contrast, our protocol requires:
\[ 1.5C\sigma Ny \log_2 Nx \text{ bits of communication}, \]
where:
- \( C \) is a small constant for ciphertext expansion,
- \( \sigma = 32 \) is the string length, and
- \( 1.5 \) is a factor related to cuckoo hashing utilization without a stash.

For example, when \( Nx = 224 \) and \( Ny = 5535 \), our protocol requires only 12.5 MB of communication, whereas the empirical communication of [KKRT16] in this setting is almost 115 times larger.

### Running Time Comparison

This increase in communication translates into increased running times compared to [PSZ16] and our protocol in WAN settings. For instance, when intersecting 5535 and 224 items on a 10 Mbps connection, our protocol is more than 57 times faster, while [PSZ16] is only 3 times faster. The total running times are summarized in Table 5 for easy comparison.

Since the implementation of [KKRT16] does not support multi-threading, we only present results for \( T = 1 \).

### Conclusions

Although there has been significant progress in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes since Craig Gentry's groundbreaking work in 2009, it is still considered too expensive for many practical use-cases. However, in this paper, we have constructed a practical private set intersection (PSI) protocol using the Fan-Vercauteren scheme, incorporating and combining optimizations from both FHE and cutting-edge PSI research. Our protocol is particularly interesting for the private contact discovery use-case, achieving a very low communication overhead: about 12 MB to intersect a set of 5 thousand items with a set of 16 million items, which is significantly lower than in previous state-of-the-art protocols.

We regard our work as a first step in exploring the possibilities of applying FHE to PSI and look forward to further discussions and optimizations.
