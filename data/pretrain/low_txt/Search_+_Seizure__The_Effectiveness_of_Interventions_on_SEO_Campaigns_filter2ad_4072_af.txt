### Domain Seizures and Their Impact on Online Counterfeit Stores

From December 2012 to June 2014, GBC, representing 17 brand holders, seized 31,000 domains using 69 court orders. Similarly, SMGPA, representing 11 brand holders, seized 8,000 domains using 47 court orders from February 2012 to July 2014.

Seizing domains can disrupt online counterfeit stores. For example, Figure 6 illustrates the order numbers over time for four stores promoted by the PHP?P= campaign. The domain for the Abercrombie UK store was seized on February 9, 2014 (indicated by a vertical dotted line), and its rate of new orders declined immediately. However, it did not stop completely due to the SEO campaign's rapid response, as discussed in Section 5.3.2.

Despite these efforts, brand holders need to be more aggressive in seizing domains. From the PSRs crawled, we directly observed 290 seizures over an eight-month period: 214 by GBC and 76 by SMGPA. Compared to the total number of storefronts observed (7,484), these domain seizures represent only a small percentage (3.9%) of the stores used by the campaigns.

Another option is to seize doorway domains, but this presents two significant obstacles: there are two orders of magnitude more doorway domains than stores (Table 2), and many of these doorways are compromised sites.

### SEO Campaigns and Domain Seizures

SEO campaigns play a crucial role in maintaining the traffic and customer base for counterfeit stores. As shown in Figure 6, even when one store's domain is seized, orders remain steady at other stores whose domains were not seized, and the SEO campaign remains effective overall.

### Reaction Time to Domain Seizures

Even if brands eventually seize all storefront domains, the current environment still favors attackers due to the slow pace of domain seizures and the quick response of attackers. The time between when a storefront goes live and when a brand seizes the domain represents the window of opportunity for a counterfeit store to monetize traffic. We define the lifetime of seized stores as the period from the first appearance of the storefront in PSRs to the time the domain was seized.

We find that the average lifetime of seized stores lies between 58-68 days for GBC and 48-56 days for SMGPA. Due to the nature of our data collection, we can only observe seizures when our crawlers redirect to seized stores. Therefore, we present two bounded numbers approximating the true lifetime: the smaller duration ends when we last saw the store actively poisoning search results, and the larger ends when we first definitively observed the seizure.

However, even when brands seize storefront domains, SEO campaigns have backup domains ready and can quickly react to continue monetizing traffic without significant interruption. For instance, when the Abercrombie UK domain was seized, the PHP?P= campaign redirected to a new store domain within 24 hours. This domain agility is a critical weakness of seizures: even though a store domain is seized, SEO campaigns can easily modify their doorways to redirect users to backup domains.

### Evidence of Attackers' Adaptability

We found widespread evidence of attackers exploiting this weakness as a countermeasure to domain seizures. Specifically, of the 214 seized stores from GBC, 130 were redirected to new stores (59 of which were subsequently seized). Among the 76 seized by SMGPA, 57 were redirected to new stores (22 of which were subsequently seized). These responses by counterfeiters happened on average within 7 and 15 days of the initial seizure, respectively, for GBC and SMGPA. This domain agility suggests that counterfeiters are well-prepared for domain seizures, making such interventions less effective.

### Conclusion

The online business in counterfeit luxury goods is thriving, with over 250,000 successfully delivered orders from just one supplier in nine months. These businesses prosper by poisoning search results for popular luxury goods to attract customers to their online storefronts. In this paper, we presented techniques for detecting poisoned search results and classifying the Web sites of these stores into distinct SEO campaigns. From eight months of crawled search results for 16 brand verticals, we detected 2.7 million PSRs using 27,000 doorway pages that redirect users to 7,484 storefronts, and classified over half of the PSRs into 52 distinct SEO campaigns. We also created test orders on stores to estimate their order volume over time.

Finally, we used our crawler and order data to study the effects of both search engine and domain seizure interventions on these abusive SEO activities. Although we find instances where both can disrupt counterfeit sales activity, overall, neither are currently employed with the level of coverage or responsiveness necessary to be broadly effective against the actors in this market. Search engines and brand holders should target the infrastructure at the granularity of these campaigns, as partial interventions allow campaigns to adapt and fill gaps left by the disappearance of other campaigns. The measurement and classification techniques described in this paper could provide the improved targeting required for more robust intervention.
