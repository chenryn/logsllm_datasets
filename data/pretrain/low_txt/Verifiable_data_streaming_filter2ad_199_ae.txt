### Transformations from a One-Time Signature (OTS) to a Many-Time Signature (MTS) Scheme

#### 9.1 Construction

The fundamental concept of our construction is to store the keys of the one-time signature scheme in the leaves of the Chameleon Authentication Tree (CAT). Since the keys are generated uniformly at random and independently of the message to be signed, a weaker security notion than that provided in Definition 4.2 is sufficient. For a detailed explanation, we refer the reader to the full version [SS12].

**Construction 3:**
Let \( \text{Sig} = (\text{Gen}, \text{Sign}, \text{Vrfy}) \) be a signature scheme defined over the message space \( M = \{0, 1\}^\lambda \), and let \( \text{wCAT} = (\text{wcatGen}, \text{waddLeaf}, \text{wcatVrfy}) \) be a chameleon authentication tree. We define the signature scheme \( \text{cSig} = (\text{cGen}, \text{cSign}, \text{cVrfy}) \) as follows:

- **Key Generation Algorithm (cGen):**
  - The key generation algorithm runs \( (\text{wsp}, \text{wvp}) \leftarrow \text{wcatGen}(1^\lambda) \).
  - It returns the private key \( \text{SK} \leftarrow \text{wsp} \) and the corresponding public key \( \text{PK} \leftarrow \text{wvp} \).

- **Signing Algorithm (cSign):**
  - To sign a message \( m \in \{0, 1\}^\lambda \), the signing algorithm generates a key pair \( (\text{SK}', \text{PK}') \leftarrow \text{Gen}(1^\lambda) \).
  - It signs the message \( \sigma_0 \leftarrow \text{Sign}(\text{SK}', m) \).
  - It adds the public key to the CAT by computing \( (\text{wsp}', i, \text{waPath}) \leftarrow \text{waddLeaf}(\text{wsp}, \text{PK}') \).
  - It sets \( \sigma_1 \leftarrow (i, \text{waPath}) \) and returns the signature \( \sigma \leftarrow (\sigma_0, \sigma_1, \text{PK}') \).

- **Verification Algorithm (cVrfy):**
  - The verification algorithm parses \( \text{PK} = \text{wvp} \) and \( \sigma = (\sigma_0, \sigma_1, \text{PK}') \) with \( \sigma_1 = (i, \text{waPath}) \).
  - It outputs 1 if both conditions hold:
    - \( \text{wcatVrfy}(\text{wvp}, i, \text{PK}', \text{waPath}) = 1 \)
    - \( \text{Vrfy}(\text{PK}', m, \sigma_0) = 1 \)

As discussed in Section 6.1, the security of our construction holds for a tree that authenticates an exponential number of \( 2^\lambda \) signatures. This follows from our construction, as we never store all elements simultaneously.

Let \( q := q(\lambda) \) be an upper bound on the number of signing queries from the adversary. We distinguish two cases:
- **Case 1:** The adversary outputs a forgery for a leaf \( 1 \leq i^* \leq q \). In this case, we build an adversary that either breaks the structure-preserving property of the CAT or forges the one-time signature scheme.
- **Case 2:** The adversary outputs a forgery for a leaf \( q + 1 \leq i^* \leq 2^\lambda \). In this case, we show how to break the one-wayness of the CAT.

**Theorem 4:**
If \( \text{Sig} \) is a secure one-time signature scheme and \( \text{CAT} \) is a weakly structure-preserving and weakly one-way chameleon authentication tree, then Construction 3 is unforgeable under adaptive chosen message attacks.

The proof is given in the full version of this paper [SS12].
