#### A.1 5G Throughput Performance Impact Factor Analysis: Extended Results

**A.1.1 Impact of Geolocation**

Figure 17 shows extended results for the normality and Levene tests for §4.1. Using a significance value of 0.001, the normality test indicates that throughput measurements at approximately 48% of geolocations (i.e., almost half the area) in the indoor (Airport) setting do not follow a normal distribution. Similarly, for the outdoor (Intersection) setting, the percentage of geolocations is about 33%. Using a significance value of 0.1, the Levene test shows that the variances of throughput measurements for 64.26% and 61.06% of geolocation pairs significantly differ from each other for the Indoor (Airport) and the outdoor (Intersection) settings, respectively.

**Figure 17: Indoor v/s Outdoor: Normality & Levene Tests**

**A.1.2 (Indoor) Impact of Mobility Direction**

With the same mobility direction, 78.05% of geolocations have throughput samples that are normally distributed, representing an increase of over 25% compared to when the mobility direction is ignored, as shown in Table 4. For the pairwise t-test, considering the mobility direction information, 80.87% of the geolocation pairs have significantly different throughput means, which is an increase of 10.01%. Additionally, 29.76% of geolocations have throughput samples with CV values greater than 50%, a decrease of 23% when the mobility direction is accounted for. This suggests that the variances of throughput samples at a given geolocation decrease when the mobility direction is considered. Figure 19 shows extended results for the impact of mobility direction in the indoor (Airport) area, including both trajectories (NB, SB) and the combined trajectories when the mobility direction is ignored (NB+SB).

**Figure 19: (Indoor) Impact of Mobility Trajectory on Normality Test, t-test, Levene Test & CV**

**A.1.3 Impact of UE-Panel Mobility Angle**

Figure 18 illustrates the effect of the UE-panel mobility angle \(\theta_m\) on 5G throughput with respect to the south and north panels. It can be observed that, for both panels, throughput is high when the UE is moving straight towards either panel—i.e., \(\theta_m\) is in the range [165°, 180°) (see illustration of \(\theta_m\) values in Fig. 8). The south panel appears to have better coverage, as the UE can achieve relatively good throughput even while moving away from the panel (i.e., when \(\theta_m\) is in [30°, 75°]). For certain ranges, such as [210°, 240°) for the south panel and [90°, 120°) for the north panel, poor throughput is observed, likely due to poor NLoS paths in the airport's mall area.

**Figure 18: Impact of UE-Panel Mobility Angle \(\theta_p\) by Individual 5G Panels on 5G Throughput at the Airport Area**

**A.1.4 Congestion with Other UEs**

To investigate how 5G throughput is affected when multiple UEs connect to the same 5G panel, we conducted an experiment in the Airport area. We placed multiple UEs side-by-side within the coverage footprint of a single 5G panel, at a distance of approximately 25m with clear line of sight (LoS). We used four UEs (UE1, UE2, UE3, UE4), each scheduled to start an iPerf session with a 1-minute gap between session start times and the same end time. Each iPerf session was at least 1 minute long, resulting in a 4-minute-long experiment set. This allowed us to observe the impact of "artificially induced" congestion. iPerf servers were running on VMs provisioned in different public clouds (e.g., Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure). To avoid Internet bottlenecks, we repeated the experiment sets and shuffled the UE-VM combinations in each iteration.

Figure 21 shows a representative run of this experiment, reporting the throughput perceived by UE1, which ran for the entire 4-minute duration. In the first minute, when UE1’s iPerf session was running alone, throughput exceeded 1.5 Gbps. However, as soon as UE2 started its session, UE1’s throughput nearly halved. Similar behavior was observed when the iPerf sessions of UE3 and UE4 began. This experiment highlights the dynamic factor of time-of-day effects on 5G throughput, which could be further improved by incorporating the number of subscribers connected to a 5G panel as an input feature.

**Figure 21: Impact on 5G Throughput Perceived by a Single UE When Multiple UEs Are Connected to the Same 5G Panel**

**A.1.5 Statistical Analysis for Intersection Area**

Similar to Table 4, which summarizes the statistical analysis for the Indoor/Airport area, Table 10 provides the statistical analysis for the Outdoor (Intersection) area. The observations for the Indoor area also hold true for the Outdoor area: (i) Geolocation alone is insufficient to characterize and predict 5G throughput, but it remains a key factor; (ii) Accounting for mobility-related factors along with geolocation decreases variation in 5G throughput and improves its predictability.

**Table 10: Summary of Factors Affecting 5G Throughput and Its Predictability for the Outdoor (Intersection) Area**

#### A.2 Feature Importance

Using GDBT’s ability to report global feature importance, Figure 22 shows the feature importance scores in 5G throughput prediction. The score is a value between 0 and 100%, where the sum of all features' scores equals 100%. Key observations include: (1) No single feature dominates the throughput prediction problem in 5G. For instance, in the case of T+M+C, connection status (Radio Type/Strength), UE-Panel mobility angle, UE-Panel distance, UE-Panel positional angle, and UE’s moving speed all show significant importance in predicting throughput. (2) The performance of both L+M and T+M feature groups is comparable, which is intuitive as they are the same, just from different perspectives (UE and 5G panel).

**Figure 22: Feature Importance Using GDBT**

#### A.3 Performance Improvement of Lumos5G Over Existing Baselines

Figure 23 compares the performance of our models to existing approaches in different areas using feature groups. Approaches using naive location-based models (L) and spatial interpolation methods (OK) perform poorly compared to our models, which account for mobility and connection information. Our models achieve 16% to 113% higher w-avgF1 than pure-location-based Kriging methods and 5% to 88% higher w-avgF1 than pure-location-based KNN and RF models. This demonstrates the importance of mobility and connection features for 5G throughput prediction. Our results clearly indicate the superiority of both Seq2Seq and GDBT models over existing throughput prediction methods.

#### A.4 4G v/s. 5G Throughput Prediction

In 3G/4G, location alone is known to be useful for predicting cellular performance [43, 56]. To further investigate, we constructed a dataset by holding two 5G smartphones side-by-side, one connected to 4G and the other to 5G, and walked a 1300m loop over 30 times spanning multiple days, logging the perceived throughput traces. We then applied existing approaches such as KNN, OK [26], and RF [20] to the 5G traces. Results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) on 4G traces is about [29.01, 69.13, 25.94] Mbps for KNN, OK, and RF, respectively, while the same approaches on 5G traces show the MAE to be 10× higher—[325.95, 625.83, 339.57] Mbps, respectively. These results exemplify that while existing models work well for predicting 4G throughput, they are unable to predict 5G throughput. This is because such methods cannot account for the sensitivity of mmWave-based 5G to the environment, where small perturbations (e.g., device orientation, moving direction, moving speed) affect 5G performance. Therefore, geolocation alone is infeasible for estimating mmWave-based 5G performance. In this paper, we propose the Lumos5G framework, which generalizes classical location-based cellular performance prediction into a context-aware prediction problem. The framework shows that in the future, a data-driven model could use a wide range of contextual and environmental data to model and predict 5G (all bands) + LTE + other lower band performance, accounting for several challenges faced by mmWave.
