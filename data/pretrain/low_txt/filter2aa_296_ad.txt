### Important Considerations for Multiple NetBoot Servers

If your network has more than one NetBoot server, be cautious as the client may restart from a disk image on a different server than the one you are working with. When using Macintosh Manager with NetBoot client computers, each time you start or restart the client, log in as a Macintosh Manager administrator who is part of the System Access workgroup.

### Installing Software or Changing the Mac OS 9 Disk Image

1. **Log in to the Server Volume:**
   - Log in to the server volume as a user with read/write access (e.g., an administrator).

2. **Log in to All Server Volumes:**
   - Use the Chooser to log in to all the server volumes on the client.

3. **Copy and Open NetBoot Desktop Admin:**
   - Copy the NetBoot Desktop Admin application to a local volume on the client, then open the application.
   - Note: NetBoot Desktop Admin is provided on the NetBoot for Mac OS 9 CD (available separately).

4. **Create a Private Copy:**
   - Click "Make Private Copy."
   - This process may take several minutes and should not be interrupted. Upon completion, the NetBoot client computer will automatically restart.

### Important Notes

- The copy of the disk image is associated with the NetBoot client computer used to create it. Therefore, any changes must be made using the same computer. Changing computers will result in the loss of visibility of the changes and increase the risk of unauthorized modifications to the disk image.

5. **Adjust Disk Image Size:**
   - If installing a new version of the Mac OS or adding system extensions, ensure the disk image is large enough to accommodate the new system and extensions.
   - Increasing the size of an image is irreversible without reverting to a smaller backup copy.

6. **Install New Application Software:**
   - Ensure the disk image has sufficient space for the new software. Increase the size of the image only as much as necessary, as reducing the size is not possible without reverting to a smaller backup copy.

7. **Install Software or Make System Changes:**
   - Install the latest updates for the system software.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided with the software. Restart the computer if necessary.
   - After installing an application, open it to enter a registration number if required. This step also creates a preferences file in the System Folder, which is essential for users to open the application.

8. **Empty the Trash:**
   - Ensure there are no files in the Trash that you want to save, as the Trash will be emptied automatically in the next step.
   - If you cannot empty the Trash due to in-use files, you may need to restart the computer.

9. **Log Back In to Server Volumes:**
   - If necessary, use the Chooser to log back in to all the server volumes.

10. **Save and Restart:**
    - Open the NetBoot Desktop Admin application and click "Save." The computer will restart automatically.
    - If additional changes are needed, click "Quit" and return to Step 7.
    - Clicking "Discard" will remove the changes made to the disk image.

### Final Steps

11. **Restart and Log In:**
    - Start the NetBoot client computer again and log back in to all the server volumes.

12. **Backup Old Disk Images:**
    - Open NetBoot Desktop Admin.
    - If you want to keep a backup copy of the old disk image, select the "Keep previous disks as backup" option. Backup copies are stored in the Backup Images folder within the Shared Images folder on the NetBoot server.
    - Note: There is only one backup folder, so the current backup will overwrite any previous backups.

13. **Save and Restart:**
    - If you clicked "Save" in Step 10, click "Restart." Otherwise, click "OK."
    - Clicking "Restart" will save your changes, delete the old disk image, and restart the computer. Changes will be available the next time a NetBoot client computer restarts. Clicking "OK" will delete the old disk image without saving changes.

### Setting Up Multiple Mac OS 9 Images

To create more than one Mac OS 9 disk image:
1. Copy the preconfigured disk image from the NetBoot for Mac OS 9 CD into the directory `/Library/NetBoot/NetBootSPn` on any server volume.
2. Use NetBoot Desktop Admin to modify the Mac OS 9 disk images as desired.
3. Use Server Admin to enable disk images and select the default disk image. See “Enabling Images” on page 34 and “Specifying the Default Image” on page 37.

### Unlocking an Image

If an image is locked, you must unlock it before making any changes:
1. Log in as the root user.
2. Select the image file and choose `File > Show Info`.
3. Uncheck the "Locked" checkbox.

### Creating Install Images

#### Creating an OS Install Image

To create an image for installing the OS software on a client computer, use the Network Image Utility found in `/Applications/Server/`.

1. **Log in to the Server:**
   - Log in to the server as an administrative user.

2. **Open Network Image Utility:**
   - Open Network Image Utility and click "New Install."

3. **General Pane:**

   - If creating the image on the same server, choose a volume from the "Serve from NetBoot share point on" pop-up menu.
   - To save the image elsewhere, choose a location from the Where pop-up menu or navigate to a folder.

10. **Save:**
    - Click "Save."
    - Check the progress in the lower-left corner of the window. If prompted to insert another CD, follow the instructions.

### Adding Software to Boot and Install Images

There are two methods to include additional software in an image:
1. Add applications and files to an existing system before creating an image.
2. Add packages containing the additional applications and files to an existing image.

### About Packages

A package is a collection of compressed files and related information used to install software. The contents of a package are contained within a single `.pkg` file. The following table lists the components of a package:

| File in Package | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `product.pax.gz` | Compressed and archived files to be installed. |
| `product.bom` | Bill of Materials: record of file installation locations. |
| `product.info` | Information displayed during installation. |
| `product.sizes` | Text file containing the number of files in the package. |
| `product.tiff` | Custom icon for the package. |
| `product.status` | Created during installation, indicates "installed" or "compressed." |
| `product.location` | Shows the installation location. |
| `software_version` | (Optional) Version of the package to be installed. |

### Creating Packages

Use PackageMaker to create packages containing the application or files. PackageMaker is located in the Utilities folder on the Mac OS X Server Administration Tools CD.

For more information, open PackageMaker and choose "PackageMaker Help," "PackageMaker Release Notes," or "Package Format Notes" from the Help menu.

After creating the packages, add them to your boot or install image using the Network Image Utility. See “Creating an Application-Only Install Image” on page 30 or “Adding Packages to a Boot or Install Image” on page 30.

### Adding Packages to a Boot or Install Image

To include additional application or file packages in an image:
1. **Add to a New Image:**
   - Click the Add (+) button after selecting the image source in the Contents pane.
2. **Add to an Existing Image:**
   - Open Network Image Utility, click "Images," select the image, click "Edit," and then click the Add (+) button in the Contents pane.
   - Alternatively, drag package icons from the Finder to the Other Items list in the Contents tab.

Note: You cannot add metapackages to an image using the Network Image Utility.

### From the Command Line

You can also add packages to a boot or install image by modifying the image and its associated `rc.cdrom.packagePath` or `minstallconfig.xml` file in Terminal. For more information, see the system image chapter of the command-line administration guide.

### Creating an Application-Only Install Image

To create an install image that contains application software but no OS software, deselect the "Include Mac OS X" option in the Contents pane in the Network Image Utility.

Note: You cannot use the Network Image Utility to create an automated install image that contains a metapackage or more than one regular package. This can be done using commands in Terminal. For more information, see the system image chapter of the command-line administration guide.

### Automating Installation of an Image

To install Mac OS software with limited or no interaction from the client computer, use the Network Image Utility to create an automated install image.

1. **Open Network Image Utility:**
   - Open Network Image Utility and click "New Install."

2. **General and Contents Panes:**
   - Provide the necessary information in the General and Contents panes.

3. **Installation Options:**
   - Select "Enable automated installation."
   - Configure the options, such as target volume, erasing the target volume, and requiring user confirmation.

4. **Create Image:**
   - Click "Create Image."
   - If the name provided for the install volume does not match a volume on the client computer, a user at the client computer must respond to an installer prompt.

### From the Command Line

You can also set up an image for automated installation by modifying the associated `minstallconfig.xml` file using Terminal. For more information, see the system image chapter of the command-line administration guide.

### Viewing the Contents of a Package

To view the contents of a package, hold down the Control key, click the package in a Finder window, and choose "Show Package Contents" from the context menu.

### Installing Mac OS Updates

To use Network Install to install operating system updates on client computers, add the system update package to an installer image in the same way you would add any other package. See “Creating an Application-Only Install Image” on page 30.

You can download Mac OS updates from [www.apple.com/support](http://www.apple.com/support).
