## A Tale of Two Approaches

### C. Lueless
- **Mission:** Perform a weekly vulnerability scan of all public IP addresses.
- **Process:**
  - Manually starts the scan very early in the morning.
  - Waits for the scan to complete and goes back to sleep.
  - Analyzes the report in the morning.

### B. Rightlad
- **Uses Seccubus:**
  - Spends the morning configuring Seccubus.
  - Relaxes while the scanning happens at night.
  - Analyzes the findings and remediates upon waking up.

## Problem Description
- **Nessus:**
  - Powerful and free TCP/IP security scanner.
  - Best-valued security scanner (sectools.org surveys of 2000, 2003, and 2006).
  - Generates a large amount of output, which can be overwhelming.
  - Scanning is time-consuming and not automated.
  - Analysis is labor-intensive.
  - GUI is not ideal for analyzing scans.
  - Work risk ratio is high.

## What is Seccubus?
- **Overview:**
  - A wrapper around vulnerability scanners.
  - GUI designed for analyzing and "ticking-off" findings.
  - Compares consecutive scans.
  - Supports multiple scanners: Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto, and more.

## How Seccubus Works Differently
- **Scanning:**
  - Initiated from the command line, allowing scheduling via cron.
- **Data Storage:**
  - Findings stored in a directory structure (currently acting as a database).
- **Presentation:**
  - WebGUI for easy triage and filtering.
  - Status tracking to "tick-off" findings.

## Under the Hood
- **Nessus Client:**
  - Started via the command line.
  - Results saved in HTML, XML (no longer supported in Nessus 4.x), and NBE formats.

## The Scanning Cycle
- **Week 1:**
  - C. Lueless manually starts and analyzes the scan.
  - B. Rightlad schedules the scan and relaxes.
- **Week 2:**
  - C. Lueless repeats the manual process.
  - B. Rightlad continues to benefit from scheduled scans.
- **Week 3:**
  - C. Lueless remains in the manual loop.
  - B. Rightlad enjoys the efficiency of Seccubus.

## Status Management
- **Automatically Assigned:**
  - **NEW:** Found for the first time.
  - **CHANGED:** Output has changed.
  - **GONE:** Not found anymore.
- **User-Assigned:**
  - **OPEN:** Risk present.
  - **NO ISSUE:** No risk.
  - **FIXED:** Should not trigger again.
  - **HARD MASKED:** Ignore this finding.

## Why Seccubus?
- **Manual Scanning:**
  - Requires getting up at night to start scans.
  - Involves looking at non-informative findings every month.
  - High chance of errors due to repetitive work.
- **Seccubus:**
  - Schedules scans via crontab.
  - Focuses on findings that need attention.
  - Reduces errors through automation.
  - Effort proportional to changes in infrastructure.
  - Risk proportional to changes.

## Development and Open Source
- **Why We Developed Seccubus:**
  - Needed an efficient tool.
  - Gave back to the open-source community.
  - Utilized many open-source tools: Nagios, CFEngine, Rancid, MRTG, RRDtool, Cacti, LAMP, CVS, etc.

## Roadmap
- **Future Versions:**
  - Database backend for better performance and easier issue linking.
  - Support for more scanners: Nikto, NMAP, Metasploit, and others.
  - Open architecture for adding more scanners, pluggable authentication, and trouble ticket integration.
  - Managerial information: graphs and dashboards.
