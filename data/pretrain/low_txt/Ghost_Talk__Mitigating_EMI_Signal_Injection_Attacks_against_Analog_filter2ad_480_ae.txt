### U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) FIPS 140-2 Document

The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued the FIPS 140-2 document [36], which specifies defense techniques against electromagnetic radiation exfiltration for unintentional radiators and digital devices that comply with the requirements outlined in 47 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 15, Subpart B, Class A and B. We did not expect commodity electronics to meet the FIPS 140-2 standards; however, we were surprised by how easily we could penetrate the device's analog sensing system with rogue signals. Given the critical role of commodity and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) electronics in today’s systems, it is essential to understand the extent of vulnerabilities in analog sensing circuits.

### Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)

The field of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is primarily concerned with avoiding, minimizing, or coping with induced voltages on electronic circuits. However, the proposed techniques have not been implemented in most of the devices tested in this work. These techniques include the removal of random noise, such as broadband additive white Gaussian (AWG) noise, or narrowband interferences. Both types of noise are generally considered benign. Our focus was on malicious signal injection using in-band signals to obscure the actual signal. While Mansson [4] has investigated the disruption of digital circuits by intentional and high-intensity radiation, our work specifically addresses signal injection.

### Medical Devices

Halperin et al. have demonstrated vulnerabilities in Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs), but their approach differs from ours [39]. Halperin et al. identified vulnerabilities in the digital control channels used to communicate with IMDs, whereas our work exploits faults in the analog sensing apparatus of pacemakers and defibrillators. This approach is broadly applicable to electronics with analog sensing inputs, regardless of the specific protocol or sensor type.

### Fault Injection

The use of hardware fault injection to cause security breaches has been studied previously [16], [37], [38]. These attacks typically target digital circuits to corrupt memory and force the execution of arbitrary code. In contrast, our work does not alter the system's logic but exploits vulnerabilities in the analog inputs to modify the system's behavior based on the current unaltered programming logic.

### Cardiac Tissue Response to Pacing Pulses

Figure 16 illustrates the cardiac tissue response to pacing pulses. The top panel shows no pacing, the middle panel shows a pacing pulse during the absolute refractory period, and the bottom panel shows a pacing pulse after the absolute refractory period. Note that the cardiac wave occurs immediately after our pacing pulse.

During a cardiac probe test, an attacker might attempt to cheat the test by sending a high-amplitude pulse during the absolute refractory period, even though the real cardiac tissue is not reacting. Since the attack is blind, the attacker cannot see the actual cardiac signals, making it a random hit. The probability of landing in the absolute refractory period (ARP) is given by \( P(\text{ARP}) = \frac{t_{\text{arp}}}{t_{\text{interval}}} \), where \( t_{\text{arp}} \) is the absolute refractory period and \( t_{\text{interval}} \) is the beat-to-beat interval. To reduce the attacker’s success probability, multiple probes can be conducted, forcing the attacker to repeatedly send pulses in the ARP to avoid detection. For successful inhibition of pacing, the forged pulses need to be sent continuously. The probability of success decreases with the number of probes, but not as rapidly as if the pulses were independent events. Thus, the lower bound of the probability of avoiding detection is \( P(\text{ARP})^n \), where \( n \) is the number of probes used.

### Reverting to a Safe Default

If the previous test determines that the signal is not trustworthy, the system has three options:
1. Disconnect the output from the input.
2. Limit the output to a known safe range.
3. Remove the victim from the environment.

In the first case, the system can revert to asynchronous pacing—Atrial (AOO), Ventricular (VOO), or Dual (DOO)—as programmed by medical personnel. In the second case, the output can be adjusted based on the specific requirements. CIEDs have been reported to be affected by static magnetic fields [40] but only at very short distances (under 3 cm) and Low Frequency RFID emissions [24], though these waveforms were not intentionally crafted to force a mis-sense on the device.

### Conclusion

Analog sensors inherently trust what they measure, and digital systems trust the input provided by these sensors. As a result, intentional electromagnetic interference can trick sensors into providing false information to higher-level applications. This can have serious implications, ranging from causing pacemakers to stop pacing to injecting chosen touch-tone numbers during phone calls with a Bluetooth headset to an automated bank service center. Our experiments found no clinically relevant risks for completely implanted medical devices at distances under 5 cm for a 10 W adversary. In free air, our experiments caused measurable interference at 1-2 m. We do not believe the current situation poses an urgent public health risk. Our proposed defenses include traditional analog shielding and a digital signal contamination metric based on the root mean square of waveform amplitudes. Our cardiac defense mechanism detects suspicious sensor input by checking whether pacing pulses are consistent with the refractory period of cardiac tissue. Secure websites follow the principle of not trusting unvalidated user input, and this advice should also apply to sensor systems.
