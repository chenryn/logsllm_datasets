### Attack to Learn Host Communication Patterns and ACL Entries

Even if injected packets do not trigger replies, attacks can still learn host communication patterns and ACL entries. However, none of the existing methods can be used to find target paths containing shared links with control paths.

### Attacks on SDN and Related Defenses

**SE-Floodlight [48] and SDNShield [63]** are designed to provide permission control for malicious SDN applications. Some studies focus on the security of controllers, including network poisoning [31], identifier binding attacks [35], subverting SDN controllers [49], and exploiting harmful race conditions in SDN controllers [65]. Other studies address data plane security, such as low-rate flow table overflow attacks [22], SDN teleportation, and detection of abnormal data plane behavior [51].

Our paper focuses on the security of the control channel, which is orthogonal to existing work. We uncover a new type of attack that has not been discovered by existing automatic attack discovery tools [34, 43, 59] in SDN. The packet-in flooding attack [55, 60] is the closest to ours, as it saturates the control channel with a large number of packet-in messages. To trigger these control messages, the attack requires generating massive bogus packets that do not match any rules in the switches. In contrast, our attack generates low-rate data traffic to implicitly disrupt control traffic in shared links, rather than directly generating massive control traffic. Our attack can bypass previous defenses [55, 60, 52, 27] against packet-in flooding attacks because they detect and throttle malicious control traffic.

### LDoS Attacks in Traditional IP Networks

Kuzmanovic et al. [41] developed low-rate TCP-targeted DoS attacks to disrupt TCP connections. Zhang et al. [66] demonstrated the severe impact of these attacks on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) through real experiments. Schuchard et al. [50] extended this attack and designed the Coordinated Cross Plane Session Termination (CXPST) attack, which allows an attacker to use only data traffic to attack the Internet control plane. Our attack differs from previous work in three key aspects:
1. **Focus on SDN Control Channel**: Our attack targets the SDN control channel, which shares a limited number of links with data paths.
2. **Probing Techniques**: Probing techniques are required to identify target data paths containing shared links, ensuring the effectiveness of the attack.
3. **Impact on Diverse Network Functions**: Our attack has significant impacts on various network functionalities, including layer 2, 3, and 4 functions.

### Defenses Against LDoS in Traditional IP Networks

Several countermeasures have been proposed for traditional IP networks, such as randomizing RTO [42] and complex signal analysis [58, 53, 23, 64, 46, 24]. However, randomizing RTO cannot fully mitigate the attack [66], and no method has been shown to be sufficiently accurate and scalable for deployment in real networks. These defenses are generally aimed at LDoS in traditional IP networks and are not designed to protect the SDN control channel. For BGP, defenses like BGP Graceful Restart [50] have been described, but they are not suitable for protecting the SDN control channel with "dumb" SDN switches.

### Link Flooding Attacks in Traditional IP Networks

Studer et al. [38] and Kang et al. [57] introduced link flooding attacks, which generate large-scale legitimate low-speed flows to flood and congest critical network links. They use traceroute to find critical links in traditional IP networks. Our crosspath attack also congests critical links that deliver both control and data traffic in SDN. A major difference is that our crosspath attack identifies critical links using unique SDN reconnaissance techniques. Moreover, the crosspath attack can cause various damages across the entire network due to the centralized control in SDN. Although some SDN defense systems [67, 61, 62, 37] detect link flooding attacks, they cannot defend against the crosspath attack, which disrupts the control channel on which these systems depend.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we present a novel attack in SDN that disrupts the control channel by crafting data traffic to implicitly interfere with control traffic in shared links. We develop adversarial path reconnaissance to find a target data path containing shared links for the attack. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our reconnaissance works in real networks. We demonstrate that the attack can significantly disrupt various network functionalities in SDN. We hope this work draws more attention to SDN security, especially the possible attacks on the SDN control channel when deploying SDN for innovative network applications.
