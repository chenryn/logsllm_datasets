### 4.1 Additional Query Corpus

In our previous work [15], we demonstrated that the attack primarily affects individuals with non-illicit intentions. To further investigate the scope of search poisoning, we constructed an additional query corpus, \( Q' \), consisting of 600 search terms. The purpose of this new corpus is to provide evidence that search poisoning is not limited to pharmaceutical-related terms and to study whether malicious actors share parts of their infrastructure to promote different products and services.

The \( Q' \) corpus includes six categories:
- Antivirus
- General software
- Pirated software
- E-books
- Online gambling
- Luxury items (specifically, watches)

These categories were chosen based on the volume of email spam received in our spam traps. For each category, we used Googleâ€™s Keyword Planner to select the 100 most queried keyword suggestions associated with the category name. We manually filtered out queries that did not denote benign or gray intent, except for pirated software queries.

### 4.2 Search Result Datasets

We collected data on a daily basis from April 12, 2010, to September 16, 2013. While some smaller, older portions of this data have already been made public, we are making all datasets used in this paper publicly available for research reproducibility purposes. Each dataset has its own characteristics, summarized in Table 2.

#### Dataset 1 (April 12, 2010 - November 15, 2010)
- **Period**: April 12, 2010 - November 15, 2010
- **Queries Used**: Pharmaceutical query corpus \( Q \)
- **Search Results per Query**: Top 64 results (at most)
- **Ranking Information**: None
- **Redirections**: Only HTTP 302 redirects
- **Total Size of Result Corpus**: 260,824
- **Unique URLs in Results**: 150,955
- **Unique Domains in Results**: 25,182
- **Total Size of Redirection Corpus**: 50,821
- **Unique Redirection URLs**: 50,784
- **Unique Redirection Domains**: 5,546

This dataset was used in previous work to examine the impact of the attack and the characteristics of the victims.

#### Dataset 2 (November 15, 2010 - October 8, 2011)
- **Period**: November 15, 2010 - October 8, 2011
- **Queries Used**: Pharmaceutical query corpus \( Q \)
- **Search Results per Query**: Top 64 results
- **Ranking Information**: Aggregate only
- **Mapping Queries-Results**: Partial
- **Total Size of Result Corpus**: 3,609,675
- **Unique URLs in Results**: 189,023
- **Unique Domains in Results**: 36,557
- **Total Size of Redirection Corpus**: 929,809
- **Unique Redirection URLs**: 71,935
- **Unique Redirection Domains**: 8,738

This dataset contains information about the search rankings but lacks full mapping between queries, results, and their ranks.

#### Dataset 3 (October 13, 2011 - September 16, 2013)
- **Period**: October 13, 2011 - September 16, 2013
- **Queries Used**: Time-varying subset of \( Q \) and \( Q' \)
- **Search Results per Query**: 16 to 32 results
- **Ranking Information**: Yes
- **Mapping Queries-Results**: Yes
- **Total Size of Result Corpus**: 1,530,099
- **Unique URLs in Results**: 122,382
- **Unique Domains in Results**: 30,881
- **Total Size of Redirection Corpus**: 522,017
- **Unique Redirection URLs**: 62,288
- **Unique Redirection Domains**: 11,157

This dataset provides complete mapping between queries, results, and their ranks, as well as redirection chains. It was collected using an automated script to increase the level of automation.

### Data Collection Methodology

To mitigate potential cloaking by attackers, we periodically spot-checked the results gathered by our automated infrastructure with those obtained using a full-fledged graphical browser. Additionally, we ran all queries over the Tor network, changing Tor circuits frequently to achieve geographical diversity and avoid IP-based detection.

On November 30, 2011, Google introduced API restrictions, limiting the number of queries and results we could collect. As a result, we could only run a random subset of \( Q \) daily, averaging 64 queries. We also updated our collection infrastructure on April 9, 2012, to detect more advanced redirection techniques, including cookie-based redirections.

### Dataset 4 (October 31, 2011 - September 16, 2013)
- **Period**: October 31, 2011 - September 16, 2013
- **Queries Used**: Time-varying subset of \( Q' \)
- **Search Results per Query**: 16 to 32 results
- **Ranking Information**: Yes
- **Mapping Queries-Results**: Yes
- **Total Size of Result Corpus**: 2,244,723
- **Unique URLs in Results**: 122,567
- **Unique Domains in Results**: 24,339
- **Total Size of Redirection Corpus**: 111,361
- **Unique Redirection URLs**: 27,973
- **Unique Redirection Domains**: 3,974

This dataset has the same properties as Dataset 3 but uses the query set \( Q' \).

### 4.3 Combining the Datasets

Given the comprehensive mappings in Datasets 3 and 4, we can perform more in-depth analysis. However, the reduced number of queries and results in these datasets complicates combining them with Datasets 1 and 2.

#### Sampling Queries
- In Datasets 1 and 2, all queries in \( Q \) are issued daily.
- In Dataset 3, a random subset \( Q(t) \subseteq Q \) is used, with proportions of illicit, benign, and gray queries following specific distributions.
- To compare datasets, we sample queries from Datasets 1 and 2 to match the statistical properties of Dataset 3.

#### Sampling Results
- Dataset 3 is often limited to 32 results, while Datasets 1 and 2 contain the top 64 results.
- For Dataset 2, we include results with a probability based on their frequency in the top 32 positions.
- Combining query and result sampling, we use approximately 14.7% of the search results in Dataset 2, with another 12.3% included probabilistically.

### 5. Search Result Analysis

We now analyze the datasets, focusing on the evolution of search results over intervals T2 and T3 (November 15, 2010 - September 16, 2013).
