### Introduction

Drive-by downloads, particularly those leading to malware installations on unsuspecting victims, have garnered significant attention from researchers. In 2005, Moshchuk et al. [22] investigated the threats, distribution, and evolution of spyware by examining over 18 million URLs, finding that 5.9% of the pages visited contained scripted drive-by downloads. Seifert et al. [31] used the Capture-HPC client honeypot to study the prevalence and distribution of malicious web servers, identifying more than 300 such sites. Provos et al. [27] provided a detailed analysis of the sophisticated methods employed by attackers and the steps involved in executing a typical drive-by download exploit. In a subsequent study [26], the authors offered extensive quantitative measurements of the global prevalence and distribution of parties (landing sites, redirection sites, and script hosting sites) involved in drive-by downloads by analyzing billions of URLs in the Google web archive. These studies highlight the significance of the drive-by download malware problem and motivate the development of the BLADE system.

### Website Survey Systems and Proxy Services

Blacklist services like stopbadware.org [5] provide alerts on malicious software and websites, currently listing over 392,000 malicious sites. Tools such as Strider HoneyMonkey [34] and phoneyc [23] crawl the Internet to find websites hosting malicious code. While Strider HoneyMonkey uses Virtual Machines with different operating systems and patch levels, phoneyc is a lightweight, low-interaction system that emulates browser execution of JavaScript. SpyBye [25] operates as a proxy server, classifying URLs into three categories: harmless, unknown, or dangerous. This classification process can be error-prone and is intended as a tool for webmasters to track the security of their sites. The SecureBrowsing software plug-in developed by Finjan [4] scans web pages in real time for viruses and malware using proprietary detection methods, likely combining attack signatures and URL blacklists. BrowserShield [30] is a proxy system that rewrites scripts and applies vulnerability-driven filtering to transform inbound web pages into safe equivalents by disabling the execution of malicious JavaScript and VBScript at runtime. Wepawet [13] is an online service for detecting and analyzing malicious URLs, capable of analyzing exploits in Flash, JavaScript, and PDF files. Unlike these approaches, BLADE does not require attack signatures and is effective against zero-day attacks.

SpyProxy [21] is an execution-based malware detection proxy system that executes active web content in a virtual machine environment before it reaches the browser. A limitation is that protection is guaranteed only when the host machine and the proxy machine maintain identical software configurations.

### Network- and Host-Based Malware Defense Systems

Systems like BotHunter [14] and BotSniffer [15] are designed to detect infected enterprise systems based on post-infection network dialog but do not prevent malware execution. AntiVirus systems [6] and services like CloudAV [24], which attempt to block malware execution, rely on binary signatures. For drive-by attacks, BLADE addresses the limitations of these approaches by acting as an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) that thwarts the execution of malware without relying on signatures.

Egele et al. [12] proposed using x86 emulation techniques to defend browsers against heap-spraying code injection attacks. Their objective is similar to that of NOZZLE [29], which uses static analysis of objects in the heap to detect such attacks. BLADE differs from these systems in that it prevents the execution of malware rather than detecting the attack. Our approach provides comprehensive defense against all forms of web-based surreptitious-download exploits, including those using heap-spraying code injection attacks.

### Sandboxing/Isolation Systems

Solitude [17] and Alcatraz [19] are systems that limit the effects of attacks by providing support for application-level isolation and recovery. Secure browsers [9, 33] use sandboxing techniques to prevent malware installations. The Chromium sandbox [9] mitigates browser exploits by separating the trusted browser kernel (running with high-privilege outside the sandbox) from the untrusted rendering engine. However, published client-side exploits for Chrome indicate that such strategies are not foolproof. Recently, Barth et al. [7] proposed a browser extension system that uses privilege separation and isolation to limit the impact of untrusted extensions. The Polaris system [32] restricts the impact of running untrusted applications using the principle of least authority. BLADE’s prevention of unconsented content execution is similar to sandboxing. However, BLADE fully prevents binary execution rather than imposing privilege limitations and is more transparent in how it uses user-dialog confirmation to auto-remap user-initiated downloads. Unlike secure browser frameworks that require the adoption of a new browser, BLADE security protections can be deployed under a wide range of current and legacy Internet browsers.

### Conclusion and Future Work

We introduced the BLADE system as a novel approach to immunizing vulnerable Windows hosts from surreptitious drive-by download infections. BLADE incorporates a kernel module to track all browser-to-human interactions, distinguishing consented web-based binary downloads from covert binary installations. In the case of user-consented binaries, BLADE transparently remaps them to the filesystem without perceptible runtime behavioral changes or performance impacts on the browser. In the case of malicious links and binaries, BLADE isolates and reports them to the user, ensuring that these binaries are never executed, unlike traditional sandboxes.

We presented results from an ongoing evaluation of BLADE against thousands of active drive-by exploits currently plaguing the Internet. Our evaluation results are unfiltered, auto-generated, and publicly available at www.blade-defender.org. To date, BLADE’s interception logic has demonstrated 100% effectiveness in preventing covert binary installations using widely deployed browsers, including Firefox 3.5, IE 7.0, and IE 8.0. Furthermore, over the past six months, we have tested BLADE against the newest 0-day drive-by exploit attacks within days of their release, and none have circumvented BLADE. In the next phase, we plan to extend BLADE support to other network-capable applications subject to drive-by download attacks.
