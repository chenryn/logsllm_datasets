### Automated Attacks on CAPTCHAs

Over the years, various automated attacks have been launched against CAPTCHAs [16, 18, 41, 45, 47]. For instance, Tam et al. analyzed the security of audio CAPTCHAs from popular websites using machine learning techniques and were able to break many of them, including an earlier version of reCAPTCHA [47]. In 2017, Bock et al. introduced an automated system called unCaptcha, which could break reCAPTCHA’s audio challenges with an accuracy exceeding 85% [16]. Additionally, Solanki et al. proposed a low-cost attack against several popular audio CAPTCHAs using off-the-shelf speech recognition services in 2017 [45].

### Conclusion

CAPTCHAs have become a standard security mechanism for protecting websites from abusive bots. In this work, we demonstrated that one of the most widely used image CAPTCHA schemes, reCAPTCHA v2, can be broken by an automated solver based on object detection methods with a high success rate. Our extensive analysis revealed that despite multiple major security updates aimed at countering automated attacks, which rendered previous image recognition and classification-based solvers ineffective, reCAPTCHA remains vulnerable to advanced object detection systems. Given the capabilities of current object detection systems, we conclude that reCAPTCHA is essentially broken because its reverse Turing tests, designed to distinguish humans from bots, are easily solvable by an object detection-based automated solver.
