In the `bootstrap.css` file used on the demo site, at line 97, there are selectors for `body`, `a`, and `a:hover`. However, these selectors are missing in the downloadable version available from [http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/download.html](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/download.html). 

Currently, the `scaffolding.less` file (as of commit `7f32d15`) only contains these lines and no other content. It appears that this `.less` file may be excluded from the build generated via the Customize page.
