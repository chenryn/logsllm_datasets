### Visibility and Control Over Running Applications

1. **Visibility and Access Control**: The system should provide visibility into all running applications, enabling the application of access control policies and obfuscation techniques.
2. **Automation with Minimal User Involvement**: The solution should be highly automated, requiring minimal user involvement and decision-making.
3. **Comprehensive Privacy Exposure Analysis**: As proposed in our study, the system should analyze privacy exposure not only at the individual application level but also by examining the entire network traffic. This holistic approach helps mitigate the risk of a network eavesdropper adversary.
4. **Intelligent Machine Learning Techniques**: The system should employ intelligent machine learning techniques to automatically identify leaks of location data and other personally identifiable information (PII). This will enable the profiling of applications to understand the granularity of location data required by each application and to intelligently obfuscate points of interest (POIs) that can be inferred from transmitted data.

Given the complexity and resource-intensive nature of this research, we plan to leave the design, development, and evaluation of these defense approaches, particularly the application of PII obfuscation as an adversarial learning approach on clustering algorithms [55], for future work.

### Figure 13: TF-IDF Values for Each Host Name and App

This figure presents the TF-IDF values for each host name and app, which can help users become more aware of privacy risks by presenting alerts and providing the ability to override sensitive transmitted information.

### Operating System Policies and Tools

The Android OS provides built-in standard security features such as isolation, encryption, memory management, and user-granted permissions for phone resources and sensors. Once permission is granted, PII handling is guided by best practice recommendations [44]. This may include enforcing encryption for applications that send sensitive information, such as location data, over the Internet. Additionally, tools like PrivacyGuard [19] can detect and modify leaked information in network traffic, replacing it with data crafted for privacy protection.

Other tools, such as MockDroid [45] and LP-Guardian [46], can block applications from accessing the location sensor at runtime. Future versions of the Android OS could enhance privacy by allowing users to make decisions about background operations involving sensitive data.

### Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we demonstrated the extent of location leakage from mobile devices and presented a systematic process for extracting location traces from raw network traffic. We analyzed the results of three geo-clustering methods applied to inconsistent network traffic data and found that existing algorithms yield good results, even with inconsistent location data. This makes user location privacy vulnerable, even with a low rate of location leakage.

Our work enables the assessment of location exposure by monitoring network traffic and reveals that even relatively low location leakage rates (once every six hours) and coverage of only 20% can expose approximately 70% of the weighted POIs. In future work, we plan to further automate the POI identification process by automatically setting up clustering algorithm parameters, evaluate the extent to which leaked data can be used to predict future user locations, and develop a mitigation approach based on adversarial learning techniques. This approach will involve injecting a minimal number of false locations into the network traffic to deceive clustering algorithms, thereby obfuscating PII.
