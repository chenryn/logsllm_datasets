### General Knowledge Representation (GKR) for Arithmetic Circuits
GKR enables the verification of general arithmetic circuits while maintaining a linear-time prover and sublinear verification time, particularly for structured circuits. The proof size in this construction scales with the depth of the circuit.

### Inner Product Arguments
Building on the work by Bayer and Groth [12, 73], Bootle et al. [34] introduced zero-knowledge arguments for arithmetic circuit satisfiability based on inner product arguments. Bünz et al. [43] further improved this construction to achieve shorter proofs and faster verification times. Although the proofs are short, the verification time scales linearly with the circuit size, and these constructions rely on pre-quantum assumptions.

### Lattice-Based Constructions
In the lattice-based setting, several instantiations have been developed in the designated-verifier model using linear PCPs [31, 32, 65]. Baum et al. [11] presented the first publicly-verifiable argument from standard lattice assumptions, with proofs of size \(\tilde{O}(\sqrt{N})\). Bootle et al. [37] reduced the proof size further to polylogarithmic in \(N\). In both cases, the verifier is not succinct and runs in linear time.
