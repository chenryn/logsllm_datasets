I have a client for a web interface that interacts with a long-running process. I would like to display the output from this process in real-time as it becomes available. Using `urllib.urlopen()` works well for this purpose, but it lacks a timeout parameter. On the other hand, `urllib2.urlopen()` buffers the output, which is not suitable for my needs.

Is there an easy way to disable the buffer in `urllib2.urlopen()`?

One quick workaround that I considered is to use `urllib.urlopen()` in combination with `threading.Timer()` to emulate a timeout. However, this is only a quick and dirty solution.
