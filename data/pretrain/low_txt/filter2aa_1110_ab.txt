The following list identifies potential bitsquat domains based on the letter "o" and their corresponding country code top-level domains (ccTLDs):

- `.exchange` -> `excha.ge` (Georgia)
- `.helsinki` -> `helsi.ki` (Kiribati)
- `.holdings` -> `holdi.gs` (South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands)

Additionally, several proposed new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) have URL delimiter bitsquats in ccTLD space. Here is a list based on the letter "o":

- `.boo` -> `.bo` (Bolivia)
- `.bio` -> `.bi` (Burundi)
- `.cooking` -> `.co` (Colombia)
- `.cool` -> `.co` (Colombia)

### Past Bitsquatting: Domainers Capitalize on Bitsquat Domains

An examination of whois records for some already registered bitsquat domains reveals interesting findings. For example, the domain `wwwnfacebook.com` was registered in 2009, two years before the initial research paper on bitsquatting was published. Similarly, the domain `otwitter.com` was also registered early. These early registrations were made by "domainers" — organizations that register domain names to place ads or redirect traffic for profit. Domainers noticed and capitalized on the traffic destined for bitsquat domains long before any bitsquatting research was conducted. This suggests that domainers can provide insights into the popularity threshold required for a domain to generate a worthwhile number of bitsquat requests. The tools used by domainers to analyze potential domains for purchase would also be valuable to potential bitsquatters.

### Section II - Mitigation of Bitsquatting Attacks

The original research by Dinaburg suggested two possible mitigations:

1. **Self-registration of bitsquat domain variants** to remove the possibility of data misdirection.
2. **Installation of ECC memory** to reduce bit errors.

However, these mitigations are not optimal. Self-registration can be costly, especially for long domain names, and there is always the risk that someone else has already registered the domain. While ECC memory sounds promising, it would require a simultaneous upgrade of all devices worldwide to prevent bitsquatting globally.

Fortunately, there are additional techniques that network defenders can use to protect users from accidentally misdirecting their Internet traffic. With sufficient adoption, these techniques could nearly eliminate the bitsquatting problem.

#### Choose a TLD with No Bitsquats

Except for the URL delimiter bitsquats available for `.pro` and `.coop`, there are no TLD bitsquats available for the currently available gTLDs or IDN TLDs (including the newly approved gTLDs from 2013). Choosing a domain at one of these TLDs effectively removes the possibility of a bit error in the TLD misdirecting traffic.

#### If Using a ccTLD, Choose Your Domain Name Carefully

Restricting the second-level domains that can be registered, as the ccTLD `.uk` (United Kingdom) does, is not an effective way to prevent bitsquats. In fact, it can be even more dangerous. For example, for a few thousand dollars, one could register `ltd.tk`, `plc.tk`, `sch.tk`, `ac.tk`, `mod.tk`, and `tld.tk` from Tokelau, capturing bitsquats from every domain registered under the corresponding second-level domains in `.uk`. Another ccTLD with a similarly restrictive policy is `.br` (Brazil). A domain like `eng.cr` in Costa Rica can capture traffic from every domain registered under `eng.br`.

Fortunately, many ccTLDs do not allow certain common keywords (such as “www”, “gov”, etc.) to be registered, or do not allow second-level domains shorter than three characters. These restrictions make such names good choices for third-level subdomains and provide protection against URL delimiter bitsquatting.

### Change/Rotate Subdomains Frequently – The Moving Target Defense

Both domain delimiter and URL delimiter bitsquatting attacks can target a domain’s third-level domain name label. Clever use of third-level subdomains can thwart bitsquatters.

If a second-level domain eliminates the use of third-level subdomains (a.k.a. "naked" domains), then registering a URL delimiter bitsquat in a ccTLD and a domain delimiter bitsquat using a third-level subdomain become impossible. However, this exposes the domain to URL delimiter bitsquats based on the second slash of a URL, plus an additional bitsquat if the domain begins with the letter "o". As of December 2012, the team from no-www.org had cataloged 60,000 domains that do not use third-level subdomains. While eliminating subdomains helps, there are better mitigations.

A more effective technique is to distribute traffic among a large number of third-level domains. Each subdomain takes on a small slice of the overall potential bitsquat traffic, making a successful bitsquat attack less likely. Frequent changes to these subdomains further complicate attempts by bitsquatters.

For example, Amazon includes content from `cloudfront.com` in their web pages. The third-level domain names here normally would make great URL delimiter bitsquats because the "o" in `cloudfront` yields a valid ccTLD in `.cl` (Chile). However, Amazon frequently changes the subdomain at `cloudfront.com`, thwarting bitsquat attempts. This technique is the most effective protection against both domain delimiter and URL delimiter-based bitsquat attacks.

### Use Relative Instead of Absolute References in HTML

Bit errors can affect domain names loaded from memory. To reduce exposure to potential URL delimiter bitsquats, it is best to reference links and content in HTML pages relatively instead of absolutely. By using the current URL as a base href or establishing a base href for an HTML page, the relative hrefs in the rest of the document will eliminate many places where bitsquats might occur. The downside is that if a bit error occurs in the base href, all links in the document would go to the same bitsquat domain.

### Use CAPITAL Letters in URLs

The ASCII table is structured so that lowercase letters differ by only one bit from their uppercase equivalents. Bit errors in lowercase 'p' through 'y' can result in digits, but uppercase versions do not have these numeric bitsquats. Additionally, capital letters are immune to several punctuation-based bitsquats. Storing domain names in HTML pages in capital letters can help avoid domain delimiter, URL delimiter, and individual bitsquats involving lowercase letters changing to digits.

### Create a Bitsquat Response Policy Zone (RPZ)

Response Policy Zones (RPZs) have been a configuration option since BIND v9.8.1. An RPZ is a local zone file that allows the DNS resolver to respond to specific DNS requests by indicating that the domain name does not exist (NXDOMAIN) or redirecting the user to a walled garden. To mitigate single-bit errors, a DNS resolver administrator can create an RPZ that protects against bitsquats of frequently resolved or internal-only domain names. For example, the RPZ can be set up to return NXDOMAIN responses for bitsquat variants of these domains, silently correcting bit errors without client intervention.

The downside is the possibility of false positives. For example, a legitimate site like `raypal.com` (one bit different from `paypal.com`) could be blocked, preventing users from accessing it. Careful consideration must be given to the one-bit variants blocked to prevent false positives.

### Conclusion

While there is no wide adoption of bitsquatting as a real-world attack vector, the vulnerability of critical domains, including those belonging to education, government, and military, is concerning. The ease and relative anonymity of bitsquatting mean that society needs to take precautions to protect the critical domain name infrastructure that provides essential services and information.
