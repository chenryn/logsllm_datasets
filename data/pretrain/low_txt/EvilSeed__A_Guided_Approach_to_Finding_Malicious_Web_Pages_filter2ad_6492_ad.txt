### Higher Efficiency in Malware Detection: Focusing on EVILSEED

#### A. Effectiveness of EVILSEED

**Objective and Complementary Role:**
EVILSEED is designed to complement traditional crawler-based approaches for detecting malicious URLs. To evaluate its effectiveness, we ran EVILSEED in parallel with a traditional web crawler. Both systems submitted URLs to oracles, including Wepawet, Google Safe Browsing, and a custom fake AV detector (see Section II). The evaluation was conducted over 25 days, using all available gadgets except DNS queries (due to lack of trace data) and the domain registration gadget (developed later).

**Experimental Setup:**
- **Crawler & Prefilter:** A traditional web crawler traverses the web, and a fast prefilter selects pages for analysis by the oracles. The crawler is seeded with trending terms from Google Trends and Twitter, which are often exploited by attackers.
- **Web Searches:** Various queries are sent to search engines, and the results are submitted to the oracles. This approach helps contrast the toxicity of URLs found by EVILSEED with that of search engine results, which are influenced by both attacker SEO tactics and search engine pruning.

**Query Generation Strategies:**
- Random alphabetic phrases (1-5 words, 3-10 characters).
- Random phrases from the English dictionary (1-5 words).
- Trending topics from Twitter and Google Hot Trends.
- Manually-generated Google dorks (e.g., "allinurl:forcedownload.php?file=" for vulnerable WordPress sites).

**Results:**
- **EVILSEED:** Submitted 226,140 URLs, with 3,036 (1.34%) identified as malicious.
- **Crawler & Prefilter:** Discovered 604 malicious URLs, with a toxicity of 0.14%.
- **Web Search:** Found 219 malicious URLs, with a total toxicity of 0.34%.

**Key Observations:**
- EVILSEED outperformed both the Crawler & Prefilter (1.34% vs. 0.14%) and Web Search (1.34% vs. 0.34%) in terms of toxicity.
- The seed expansion (ratio of identified malicious pages to initial seeds) showed that EVILSEED could generate a significant number of malicious URLs, except for the SEO gadget, which found only 16 malicious URLs due to the absence of live SEO campaigns during the experiment.

#### B. Cost and Domain Coverage

**Cost of Querying Search Engines:**
- EVILSEED's gadgets query search engines to identify likely malicious pages. The number of queries scales linearly with the number of malicious URLs discovered, with approximately one in four queries leading to a malicious URL.

**Domain Coverage:**
- EVILSEED maintained similar domain coverage to the Crawler & Prefilter, finding an average of 6.14 malicious pages per domain compared to 6.16 for the crawler.

**Sustained Performance:**
- Over 25 days, EVILSEED consistently detected malicious pages, with a steady number of detections per day (Figure 3).

#### C. SEO Gadget Evaluation

**Initial Experiment:**
- The SEO gadget performed poorly initially, likely due to a change in the Twitter API that reduced the maliciousness of seeds based on trending topics.

**Follow-up Experiment:**
- We fetched hourly top trends from Twitter and Google Hot Trends, searched for them on Google, and analyzed the results with a cloaking detection heuristic.
- Out of 110,894 URLs collected, 248 were detected as cloaking (46 at the domain level).
- Seeding the SEO gadget with these cloaking URLs resulted in a high detection rate, indicating the effectiveness of the cloaking detection technique and the strong indication of maliciousness provided by redirection-based cloaking.

**Conclusion:**
- EVILSEED significantly outperforms traditional methods in locating malicious URLs, demonstrating higher toxicity and consistent performance over time. The SEO gadget, when properly seeded, also shows promise in detecting cloaked and malicious websites.
