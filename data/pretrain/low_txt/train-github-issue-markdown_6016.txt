Based on the discussion in issue #18115, we should implement the Double Submit Cookies CSRF prevention strategy, as described in the OWASP CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSRF_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#Double_Submit_Cookies). If feasible, this method should be set as the default CSRF prevention strategy in Symfony.

This approach enhances security by requiring both a cookie and a request parameter to contain the same value, thereby mitigating the risk of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
