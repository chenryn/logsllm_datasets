**Question:**
Where can I view the calls made to EXE programs, including their arguments? Is there a log file in Windows that tracks all EXE calls, or can such a log be enabled? Would this log include the arguments/parameters of these calls?

**Answer:**
To track the calls made to EXE programs, including their arguments, you can use the "Audit Process Creation" policy. This policy can be enabled via Group Policy if you are in a domain environment, or through Local Security Policy on an individual workstation.

**Steps to Enable Audit Process Creation:**

1. **Group Policy (Domain Environment):**
   - Navigate to: `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > System Audit Policies > Detailed Tracking`
   - Enable the "Audit Process Creation" policy.

2. **Local Security Policy (Individual Workstation):**
   - Navigate to: `Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > System Audit Policies > Detailed Tracking`
   - Enable the "Audit Process Creation" policy.

Once enabled, each time a process is started, an event with ID 4688 will be recorded in the Windows Event Log.

**Recording Command Line Arguments:**

For more recent versions of Windows and Windows Server (Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and later), you can also record the command line arguments by enabling an additional policy setting:

- **Setting:** "Include command line in process creation events"
- **Location:** `Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > System Audit Policies > Detailed Tracking`

Enabling this setting will ensure that the command line arguments are included in the event log entries for process creation.
