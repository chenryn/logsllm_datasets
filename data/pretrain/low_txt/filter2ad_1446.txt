## Abstract
This workshop focuses on physical attacks and their countermeasures. With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), interest in embedded cryptographic systems and physical attacks on these systems is increasing in both academia and industry. Sophisticated security certification and evaluation methods have been established to provide assurance about security claims through independent testing. However, these certifications are time-consuming and expensive. There is a need for further development of provably secure protection methods and automated verification tools, as well as improvements in the efficiency and quality of certification by integrating these tools and methods. These challenges motivate research in the Theory of Implementation Security.

## Background and Motivation
As information and communication technology (ICT) becomes increasingly important in our professional and private lives, the trustworthiness of this technology is paramount. Cryptography is a fundamental component in ensuring security and privacy. Traditionally, cryptography has been used to protect communication lines, assuming that both sender and receiver have physically protected equipment. Given this assumption, there are well-defined and standardized algorithms and protocols in use today. 

However, in modern applications such as payment cards, set-top boxes, and IoT devices, this assumption no longer holds. Attackers often have physical access to the device executing the cryptographic algorithm and can measure side channels (execution time, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation) or perform fault attacks (glitching, laser injection, electromagnetic perturbation). The deployment of IoT has further increased interest in physical attacks on embedded systems and the implementation security of these systems, both in academia and industry.

Sophisticated security certification and evaluation methods (e.g., FIPS, CC) have been established to provide assurance about security claims through independent testing. However, these certifications are time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes not repeatable. There is a growing need to develop provably secure protection methods and automated verification tools, as well as to improve the efficiency and quality of certification by integrating these tools and methods. This will allow for the assessment of the physical attack resilience of implementations with lower costs and reduced time.

These challenges underscore the importance of research in the Theory of Implementation Security, which is reflected in the landscape of papers presented at recent ACM CCS editions. Each of the last five years has included at least one session or tutorial on secure implementations and countermeasures against physical attacks.

## Scope and Objectives
In this workshop, we focus on physical attacks and their countermeasures, particularly considering the limitations of IoT devices. We emphasize efficiency, applicability, and tools for sophisticated security certification and evaluation. The workshop topics include:
- Physical attacks and countermeasures
- Secure and efficient implementations of cryptographic algorithms
- Designs of cryptographic algorithms with physical attack resistance
- Verification and evaluation tools

## Workshop Summary
The previous two editions of the TIS workshop were held in 2016, co-located with ACM CCS 2016 in Vienna, and in 2018, co-located with RWC 2018 in Zurich. The program for the current edition consists of four technical contributed talks and three invited lectures.
