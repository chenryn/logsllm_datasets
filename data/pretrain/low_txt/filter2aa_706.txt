## Programming and Secure Programming for Embedded/ICS Devices
- **Embedded/ICS Device Security**
- **ICS Security**

### Best Conference (after Defcon)
- **Disclaimer**: Testing industrial systems is dangerous. It can impact physical processes and people's safety, leading to accidents or disabling safety controls. Always test in controlled environments.

## Building Management Systems (BMS)
- **Components Automation & Control**: Home, buildings, factories, hospitals, offices, etc.
- **Features**: HVAC, lighting, shutters, elevators, access control, intrusion detection, safety, and security.

### BMS in Popular Culture
- **"Hackers" (1995)**: Features a BMS hacking scene: "The pool on the roof has a leak."

## The Field Network
- **Actuator, Sensor, Controller, Field Bus**
- **IP Network**: IP server, IP gateway, IP interface, operator, maintainer, and remote control.

### Why Examine Industrial Protocols and Devices?
- **Legacy Software and Protocols**: Not designed to handle cybersecurity issues.
- **Operational Mindset**: Not operated with cybersecurity in mind.

### The Interface Device
- **Reachable from the LAN**: Usually found in electrical cabinets.
- **Scanning Ports**:
  - 21/tcp: FTP
  - 22/tcp: SSH
  - 23/tcp: Telnet
  - 80/tcp: HTTP
  - 443/tcp: HTTPS
  - 3671/udp: KNXnet
  - 47808/udp: BACnet

### BMS Security Wrap-Up
- **New Attack Surface**: Unknown protocols provide new entry points.
- **What Can We Do?**
  - #1: Send valid commands.
  - #2: Send invalid commands.

### Attack Scenarios
1. **Change BMS Behavior**:
   - Enable sprinklers.
   - Disable fire detection.
   - Change thresholds.
   - Turn everything off.
   - Example: Listen to traffic, replay BACnet frames, and turn off HVAC.
   ```python
   s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM) # UDP
   s.connect(("192.168.1.1", 47808))
   try:
       while 1:
           s.send(payload_ventilation_off)
           sleep(1) # (Different kind of) DoS if we don’t wait
   except KeyboardInterrupt:
       pass
   s.close()
   ```

2. **Unintended Use of Devices**:
   - Flat network: IT and OT.
   - Network intrusion from the Internet.
   - Pivoting from local network to reach segregated areas.

### What We Know So Far
- **Introduction to BMS Security**:
  - **InSecurity in Building Automation** by Thomas Brandstetter @ Defcon 25 (2017).
  - **KNX Security or How to Steal a Skyscraper** by Yegor Litvinov (2015).
  - **Pwning KNX & ZigBee Networks** by HuiYu Wu, YuXiang Li, & Yong Yang (2018).
  - **BMS Exploitation Talks (Discovery)**: Learn how to control every room at a luxury hotel remotely by Jesus Molina @ Defcon 22 (2014).

- **Advanced Attacks and Fuzzing**:
  - **HVACking Understand the Delta Between Security and Reality** by Douglas McKee & Mark Bereza @ Defcon 27.
  - **Anomaly Detection in BACnet/IP Managed Building Automation Systems** by Matthew Peacock, 2019.

### KNX Overview
- **European Standards (1980s)**: Merged into KNX (1999), KNXNET/IP (2007), 1st Security Extension (2013), KNX Standard Free (2016).
- **Documentation and Research**: Hard to find and use documentation, limited research on KNX security.
- **Security Concerns**:
  - Authentication as an option, disabled by default.
  - Security extensions: KNX IP Secure, KNX Data Secure.
  - Security is optional.

### Getting Started
- **The Boring Way**:
  - KNX specifications free since 2016.
  - Create a fake account on KNX’s website.
  - Useful part: "Volume 3 – System Specifications."
- **The Hacker Way**:
  - Set up a test environment with KNX Virtual and ETS.
  - Listen to the traffic and learn.
  - Replay it.
  - **Tools**:
    - ETS: Engineering Tool Software provided by KNX association.
    - Wireshark: Has a KNXnet/IP dissector.

### Deciphering KNX
- **KNXnet/IP Interface**:
  - Operator, KNXnet/IP (UDP), KNX (field bus).
  - KNX Individual Address (1.1.1) = devices.
  - KNX Group Address (1/1/1) = functions.
  - Example: Scan KNX network, run commands.

### Tooling for Testing
- **ETS**
- **KNXmap**: https://github.com/takeshixx/knxmap
- **Scapy**: New KNXnet/IP layer by Julien Bedel @ Orange Cyberdefense.
- **BOF (Boiboite Opener Framework)**:
  - Python 3.6+ library.
  - Created for writing attack scripts.
  - GitHub: https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/bof

### Usage and Demos
- **High-Level Discovery**
- **Intermediate Usage**
- **Low-Level Testing**
- **Demo: Setting Up a Test Environment, Basic Operation, Advanced Testing**

### Expected Outcomes
- **Crashes and Errors**:
  - KNXnet/IP frame errors.
  - Service or software interpreting frames.
  - Possible compromise of the interface.
  - KNX frame (cEMI) errors.
  - Denial of service on devices.
  - Possible compromise of the interface.

### Wrap-Up
- **Major Impact, Minor Concern**: No need to bypass protections yet.
- **Further Exploration**:
  - Widely-used implementations.
  - KNXnet/IP security extensions.
  - Efficient security measures.

### Call to Action
- **Vendors**: Stop assuming security is the user’s problem.
- **Users**: Stop assuming security is the vendor’s problem.
- **Attackers**: New attack surface; be careful and take care of people.
- **Defenders**: New defense surface; quick win: don’t expose devices.
