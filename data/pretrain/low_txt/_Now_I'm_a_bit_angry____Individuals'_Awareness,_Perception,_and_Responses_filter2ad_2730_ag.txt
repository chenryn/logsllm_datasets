### Survey Material

#### A.1 Informed Consent

**Study Title:** Awareness, Risk Perception, and Reaction Toward Data Breaches  
**Principal Investigators:** [REDACTED]  
**Purpose of this Study:** We are conducting a research study to understand how users perceive and react to data breaches.

**Description of Your Involvement:**  
If you agree to participate in this research study, we will ask you to complete an online survey. The survey will involve reviewing data breach records associated with one of your email addresses, based on a public database of security breaches (haveibeenpwned.com), and answering a few questions about the displayed records. The survey is expected to take approximately 15 minutes.

**Requirements:**
- You must be 18 years old or older.
- You must currently live in the United States.

**Benefits:**  
While you may not receive a direct benefit from participating, this study will help us develop better systems and technologies to empower Internet users to protect themselves against data breaches.

**Risks:**  
The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during use of the Internet.

**Compensation:**  
You will be compensated $2.50 upon completing the survey.

**Confidentiality:**  
By participating in the study, you understand and agree that [REDACTED] may be required to disclose your consent form, data, and other personally identifiable information as required by law, regulation, subpoena, or court order. Otherwise, your confidentiality will be maintained as follows:
- Your data and consent form will be kept separate.

- By participating, you understand and agree that the data and information gathered during this study may be published in an academic journal or conference paper.
- You will not be asked to provide any direct personal identifiers in the study apart from your email address.
- We do not track or store your email address as part of this study, and we will not be able to tie your email address to any results or analysis.
- All records of your email address will reside only in temporary storage to facilitate the lookup of data breaches involving your email address and will be deleted following the completion of this task. The researchers will never see your email address.

**Right to Ask Questions & Contact Information:**  
If you have any questions about this research, you may contact the study team at [REDACTED].  
The [REDACTED] Institutional Review Board has determined that this study is exempt from IRB oversight.

### A.2 Email Address-Related Questions

We will ask you to enter your most commonly used email address at the bottom of this page. We will use your email address to look up whether it has been disclosed in any data breaches (also called "security breaches") using the public lookup service for data breaches, haveibeenpwned.com. If your email address was involved in any data breaches, we will ask you some questions about those breaches.

**Privacy Notice:**
- We do not track or store your email address as part of this study, and we will not be able to tie your email address to any results or analysis.
- All records of your email address will reside only in temporary storage to facilitate the lookup of data breaches involving your email address and will be deleted following the completion of this task. The researchers will never see your email address.
- To access information about breaches, your email address will be communicated to haveibeenpwned.com, a public service not operated by us, which maintains a database of data breaches involving email addresses.
- Communication with haveibeenpwned.com will occur on secure and encrypted channels, and haveibeenpwned.com also does not permanently store email addresses used in queries.
- As described in their privacy policy: "Searching for an email address only ever retrieves the address from storage then returns it in the response; the searched address is never explicitly stored anywhere."

If you have any further concerns about providing your email address, you may opt out of the survey at this time. We will remove any record of your participation. Note that if you choose to opt out, you will not be compensated.
