## Flash Remoting Technologies and Flex Data Services

### Data Management
- **Data Synchronization**: Update client and/or server when data changes.

### Messaging
- **Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP)**: Facilitates real-time data streaming.
- **Publish-Subscribe Model**: Enables efficient data distribution.

### Remoting
- **Protocols**: HTTP, SOAP, AMF.
- **Automatic Data Marshalling**: Simplifies data exchange between client and server.

### PDF Handling
- **Create and Edit PDFs**: Tools and libraries for PDF manipulation.

## CrossDomain.xml
- **Purpose**: Controls cross-domain access for Flash applications.

## Flash Remoting Insecurity
- **Common Issues**:
  - **Inadequate Access Control**: Developers often fail to implement proper authentication and authorization.
  - **Brute-Forcing Method and Service Names**: Predictable naming conventions can be exploited.
  - **Server Fingerprinting**: Flex servers can be identified, leading to targeted attacks.
  - **Vulnerabilities in Remote Methods**:
    - **Injections**
    - **Information Leakage**
    - **Denial of Service (DoS)**
    - **Privilege Escalation**

## Finding Methods and Services
- **Decompile SWF Files**: Use tools like Sothink SWF Decompiler or HP SWFScan to search for remoting calls.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Monitor network traffic to identify remoting calls.
- **Dictionary Attacks**: Perform dictionary attacks on the server to discover valid services and methods.

### Analyzing SWF Remoting Calls
- **Download and Decompile SWF File**: Extract the content.
- **Analyze ServerConfig.xml**: Look for URLs and service names.
- **Regex for Remoting Methods**: Search for keywords like "send," "service," and "remote."

### Example ServerConfig.xml
- **Embedded in SWF**: Contains URLs and service names.
- **Destination IDs**: Represent services (e.g., `securityService`, `exampleService`, `mathService`).

### Searching for Remoting Methods
- **Keywords**: Use commands like `findstr /I /N /S "sender." *.as` to search for remoting methods.

## AMF Network Traffic
- **AMF Overview**:
  - **Serialized ActionScript Object**: Transported as an HTTP POST body.
- **Interception and Decoding**:
  - **Charles Proxy**: Can intercept and decode AMF traffic.
  - **Wireshark**: Captures URLs, services, and methods (no native AMF decoder).

### AMF Network Tools
- **Charles Proxy**: For intercepting and decoding AMF traffic.
- **Wireshark**: For capturing and analyzing network traffic.

## Dictionary Attacks
- **Determining Valid Services and Methods**:
  - **Error Messages**: Use error messages to identify valid services and methods.
  - **Predictable Names**: Common method/service names (e.g., `login`, `getters`, `setters`).
  - **Default Wordlist**: Build a wordlist based on common naming conventions.

## Securing Flash Remoting
### BlazeDS
- **Public Methods**: Only methods defined in `remoting-config` can be called.
- **Security Constraints**: Use `include-methods` and `exclude-methods` in `remoting-config.xml`.
- **Documentation**: Refer to Adobe BlazeDS security documentation.

### AMFPHP
- **Protected Methods**: Methods starting with an underscore cannot be remotely called.
- **Disable Service Browser and DiscoveryService**: Remove unnecessary services.
- **Disable Remote Tracing and Debugging**: Set `PRODUCTION_SERVER` to disable these features.
- **Authorization Controls**: Use `beforeFilter` for authorization.

### PYAMF
- **Authentication**: Enable server-side authentication.

## Questions and Next Steps
- **Future Research**: Areas for further investigation.
- **Latest Code**: Available at [deblaze-tool.appspot.com](http://deblaze-tool.appspot.com/).
