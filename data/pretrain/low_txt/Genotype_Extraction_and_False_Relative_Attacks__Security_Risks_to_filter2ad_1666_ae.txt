### Pathological Kits that Match All GDFs in the Genetic Database

#### C. Generalizability of Attacks

This work focused on a security analysis of GEDmatch, but an important question is how these results might generalize to other genetic genealogy services. GEDmatch is unique due to its size (it is the largest third-party genetic genealogy service), the breadth of its API, and its prominent use in criminal forensics. However, many features, such as relative matching, chromosome visualizations, and segment coordinates in results, are common among third-party and direct-to-consumer (DTC) services.

The other significant third-party genetic genealogy service is an academic research effort called DNA.Land, which maintains a genetic database with over 160,000 GDFs [38]. Similar to GEDmatch, DNA.Land supports relative matching, providing chromosome visualizations and precise matching segment coordinates [11]. However, DNA.Land has a much more restrictive API than GEDmatch, which we suspect makes marker extraction attacks more difficult in practice.

DNA.Land does not support direct comparisons between arbitrary kits, making it more challenging to target specific users. Additionally, the resolution of chromosome visualizations is lower, which obfuscates single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level details. Although the matching coordinates appear to be high resolution, single SNP extraction (as demonstrated in Section VII) may still be possible. DNA.Land also performs significant preprocessing of each kit before analysis, including imputation, and uses a different matching technique based on the GERMLINE algorithm [20], [38]. These factors further complicate potential attacks. Therefore, we believe the risk from marker extraction is much less severe on DNA.Land compared to GEDmatch, primarily due to its more restricted API and different comparison algorithms.

Without DTC-authentication, it will be difficult to prevent false relative GDFs from being uploaded to any service as long as the attacker has access to a target’s genetic sample or GDF. Thus, an adversary could still upload false relatives to DNA.Land. However, this attack is more severe on GEDmatch because the attacker can first extract the target’s genotype, enabling them to target anyone in the database. Vulnerabilities in another service, like GEDmatch, could potentially help bootstrap relative spoofing attacks on DNA.Land by allowing the attacker to gather more information about the target, such as the underlying genotype, using the vulnerabilities in the other service.

To summarize, while we did not experiment with DNA.Land, we believe the more restrictive API and algorithmic differences make DNA.Land significantly less vulnerable to the security issues raised in this paper. If security issues were to manifest, they would be much harder to target and scale. This highlights how variations in APIs and other design choices can lead to significant differences in security, but improved security may come at the cost of reduced functionality for users. We also suspect that feature-rich APIs provide value to the genetic genealogy community, contributing to GEDmatch’s popularity. Should new services emerge, they may face similar security challenges if they also provide broad APIs favored by customers.

### X. Conclusion

In this paper, we explored new threats to genetic genealogy beyond identity inference attacks. As this work demonstrates, genetic genealogy services can be difficult to secure due to their open nature and the rich set of features they support. We hope this contributes to a discussion in the computer security and broader genetics community about emerging security risks to genetic genealogy services and spurs future research on the secure design of genetic genealogy systems, especially as these services continue to be used in high-stakes applications, such as criminal forensics.

### Appendix A: Reverse Engineering One-to-One Comparisons

We began our investigation of one-to-one comparisons by running a comparison between two kits. See Table I for a description of the kits we used during experimentation.

To construct these two kits, which we denote as `match(1)-kit` and `match(2)-kit`, we copied short runs of SNPs of varying lengths (ranging from 25 to 10,000 SNPs) from `match(1)-kit` and replaced them in `match(2)-kit` to simulate small matching DNA segments. In some cases, we copied just one base from each SNP to replicate half-matches; other times, we copied both bases to replicate full-matches (recall that each SNP has two bases, one from each parent).

#### A. Interpreting the Marker Indication Bar: Filtering SNPs

To better understand the relationship between SNPs and the 22 marker indication bars, we uploaded a third kit, called `marker-ind-kit`, and ran an additional one-to-one comparison at full resolution between `marker-ind-kit` and itself. (GEDmatch allows a kit to be compared to itself.) As anticipated, this returned 22 marker indication bars that were all green pixels — at every SNP, you are comparing the same DNA bases because `marker-ind-kit` is being compared to itself. Below the colored bars for chromosomes 1, 2, 3, and 6, it was printed: “Image Size Reduction: 1/2”. For each chromosome, the number of pixels in the marker indication bar was substantially less than the number of SNPs.

We used the GEDmatch “DNA file diagnostic utility” to get additional details about the `marker-ind-kit`. Most importantly, this utility reports the number of “Tokens” per chromosome. The number of marker indication pixels, henceforth referred to simply as pixels, for each chromosome matched the number of tokens exactly — the exceptions were chromosomes 1, 2, 3, and 6, which had twice as many tokens as pixels (to account for the 1/2 image size reduction). This suggested that after a kit is uploaded to GEDmatch, certain SNPs are removed when a kit is tokenized (a procedure that happens soon after uploading a kit). Furthermore, it indicates that each token has a one-to-one correspondence with each marker indication pixel; therefore, each tokenized SNP is compared individually between the two kits.

Our investigation of public discussions on GEDmatch led us to an online blog post suggesting that GEDmatch might discard SNPs with a low minor allele frequency (MAF) [26]. To test this hypothesis, we used allele frequency data from the 1000 Genomes project to filter out SNPs in `marker-ind-kit` with a MAF of less than 1% and re-uploaded this kit to GEDmatch. We call this new kit `filtered-kit`. After filtering, the percentage of SNPs missing dropped precipitously from 19.3% to 2.1%. Therefore, GEDmatch seems to be filtering out many SNPs with a low MAF in one-to-one comparisons.

#### B. Additional Comparison Details

This section describes additional experiments that were necessary to fully understand GEDmatch’s one-to-one comparisons.

- **Only SNPs which are present in both of the kits are compared.** We also hypothesized that only SNPs that are present in both kits will be used in a comparison. To test this, we uploaded two kits, `overlap(1)-kit` and `overlap(2)-kit`, which were designed to have overlapping and non-overlapping SNPs.
