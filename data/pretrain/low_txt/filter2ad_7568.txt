# Title: You Can't Do Today's Security With Yesterday's Methods
## Author: Joe Sullivan

### Innovation in Security
Innovation distinguishes a leader from a follower, as Steve Jobs once said. Woody Allen also emphasized that if you're not failing occasionally, it means you're not doing anything very innovative. In the context of security, a "hack" often refers to a creative solution to a programming limitation.

### The Scale of Facebook
- **Daily Activity:**
  - Over 2.5 billion shares
  - Over 2.7 billion likes
  - Over 300 million photos
  - Over 500 TB of new data
- **Infrastructure:**
  - Over 100 PB cluster
  - Code updated twice daily

### Evolving Threats
Threats are constantly evolving, and so must our security measures. This includes areas such as:
- **Product:**
  - User education
  - Content screening
  - Event screening
- **Non-Product:**
  - Enforcement
  - Bug bounty programs
  - Drills
  - Employee education
  - Corporate information security (InfoSec)

### Data-Driven User Education
Data shows that user education is effective. For example:
- **Contextual Messaging:** Provides real-time warnings and guidance.
- **Social Reporting:** 85% of the time, it leads to content removal or further conversation.
- **HTTPS Adoption:** Encourages secure connections.

### Impact of Self-XSS Education
- **Spam Distribution:** Reduced by educating users about self-XSS.
- **Checkpoints:** Increased to prevent and detect malicious activities.

### Security Features
- **Login Approvals:** Adds an extra layer of verification.
- **Link Shim:**
  - Intercepts off-site links
  - Screens against classifiers and industry lists
  - Provides real-time warnings
  - Prevents referrer leakage
  - Uses hashes to avoid open redirects
  - Dynamically rewrites for better usability

### Photo DNA
- **Image Hashes:** Runs all uploaded photos against hashes provided by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC).
- **Immediate Action:** Disables users who upload images on the hash list and sends the image and user information to NCMEC.
- **Investigation:** Investigates users caught by Photo DNA to locate other images and potentially escalate to law enforcement.

### Facebook Immune System
- **Real-Time Classification:** Every event is a classification problem.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Utilizes Random Forests, Logistic Regression, SVMs, Naive Bayes, and Boosting Trees.
- **Combined Resources:** Integrates with other resources and inputs for comprehensive analysis.

### Classifying Spam
- **User Reports:** Collects feedback from users.
- **Keywords and Links:** Analyzes text and URLs.
- **IP Addresses:** Tracks and evaluates IP addresses.
- **Additional Factors:** Considers various other indicators.

### Classifying Compromised Logins
- **Recent Failures:** Monitors the number of recent login attempts.
- **Geographic Location:** Evaluates the location of the login attempt.
- **Device Recognition:** Identifies known and unknown devices.
- **Additional Factors:** Considers various other indicators.

### Security Roadblocks
- **CAPTCHAs:** Verifies human interaction.
- **Rate Limiting:** Restricts the rate of actions to prevent abuse.
- **Disabling:** Temporarily or permanently disables accounts.

### Malware Checkpoint
- **Detection:** Identifies malware behaviors.
- **Prompt for Antivirus:** Suggests downloading free antivirus software.
- **Block Login:** Prevents login until malware is cleared.

### Social Authentication
- **Photo Verification:** Shows photos of a friend and requires identification.
- **Ease for Account Owners:** Easy for the account owner but difficult for attackers.

### Proactive Defense
- **Escalating Cases:**
  - Investigates high-value suspects.
  - Ties suspects to real Facebook accounts.
  - Coordinates with the industry for technical takedowns.
  - Works with legal teams on lawsuits.
  - Escalates to law enforcement when necessary.

### Bug Bounty Program
- **Hack Facebook:** Encourages ethical hacking.
- **Get Paid:** Offers financial incentives.
- **Get Press:** Provides recognition and publicity.

### Political and Security Issues
- **Filtering:** Deals with content filtering.
- **Forced Downgrades:** Manages forced downgrades.
- **MITM Attacks:** Detects and mitigates man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Malicious JavaScript:** Protects against malicious scripts.
- **Bogus Certificates:** Identifies and blocks fake certificates.
- **Account Takeovers:** Prevents unauthorized access to accounts.

### Corporate Information Security
- **Importance:** Just as critical as product security.
- **Expanded Bug Bounty:** Includes corporate systems.
- **Team Collaboration:** Teams cover both areas and think holistically.
- **Challenges:**
  - Disappointing products
  - Insecure endpoints
  - Interesting big data investments
  - Lack of talent for hardening work

### Research and Partnerships
- **Michigan Partnership:** Recently announced.
- **Stanford Dialogue:** Regular discussions on projects.
- **Foundation Work:** Enterprise anomalous behavior detection by a 2012 intern.
- **MITM Detection Paper:** Forthcoming.
- **Social Authentication:** Related to Microsoft research.
- **User Trust Work:** Ongoing.

### Conclusion
- **Innovation is Essential:** Critical for internet security.
- **Security Teams Must Adapt:** Cannot say no to opportunities; must show how to do it safely.
- **Culture of Innovation:** Starts at the top.
- **Broad Responsibility:** Any team can be innovative if everyone feels responsible.
