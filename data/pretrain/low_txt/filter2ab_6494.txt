### Title: BlackHat Asia-19: Make Redirection Evil Again - URL Parser Issues in OAuth

Since 2012, OAuth 2.0 has been widely adopted by online service providers around the world. Security-related issues related to OAuth have periodically made headlines, with many of these problems stemming from incorrect implementations of the protocol or services. One of the more vulnerable aspects of OAuth is the User-Agent Redirection mechanism. This feature is challenging for developers and operators to fully understand and implement correctly, leading to subtle but critical security vulnerabilities.

In this presentation, we will begin by tracing the evolution of the security community's understanding of OAuth redirection threats. We will discuss the changes and improvements made to the OAuth specification over time, as well as the best current practices for its implementation and deployment. 

We will then introduce new techniques for OAuth redirection attacks that exploit URL parsing issues in mainstream browsers and mobile applications. Specifically, some of these attacks leverage newly discovered URL interpretation bugs in popular browsers and the Android platform. These bugs were independently identified and have recently been patched.

Our empirical study, which analyzed 50 OAuth service providers globally, revealed that numerous top-tier providers, with over 10,000 OAuth client applications and tens of millions of end-users, are vulnerable to these new attack vectors. The potential impact is severe, as these attacks can enable an attacker to hijack third-party (relying party) application or web-based service accounts. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive private information and protected resources, and even allow the attacker to perform privileged actions on behalf of the victim users.

By highlighting these vulnerabilities and discussing the latest developments in OAuth security, we aim to raise awareness and help mitigate these risks.
