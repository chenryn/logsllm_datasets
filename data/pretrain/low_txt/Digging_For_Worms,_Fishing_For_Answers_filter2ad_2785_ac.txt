### Observations and Infection Likelihood

If both the presence of a file that resembles a worm and attempts to propagate are observed, the likelihood of an infection is significantly higher than if only one of these observations were made.

### Conclusions

Current efforts to combat worms primarily focus on the first three stages of their lifecycle: target selection, exploitation, and infection. Firewalls can block network probes, while network and host-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS and HIDS) can detect attempts to exploit vulnerabilities and modifications to files. However, despite these measures, sophisticated worms can still evade detection.

Little attention has been given to detecting worms during the fourth stage of their lifecycle: propagation. This paper proposes using a standard method of monitoring for a specific number of events within a given time frame, but applying it to outbound traffic rather than inbound. This approach offers the advantage of visibility into all network traffic associated with a particular host, potentially allowing for the detection of worms that were not identified in the earlier stages.

Since the fourth stage occurs post-infection, techniques in this area do not directly protect the network. Instead, they serve to contain the worm, increase confidence in alerts, and safeguard public relations. More emphasis should be placed on this phase of the worm's lifecycle, and this paper aims to contribute to that effort.
