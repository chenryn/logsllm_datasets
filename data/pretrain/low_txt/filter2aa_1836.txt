# Olympic-Sized Trunking

This article originally appeared in the December 2001 issue of *Monitoring Times*.

## Introduction
The 2002 Winter Olympic Games, scheduled to begin on February 8, 2002, will host more than two weeks of athletic events in and around Salt Lake City, Utah. With an estimated 1.5 million spectators expected to attend, radio communication will play a crucial role in ensuring the smooth, rapid, and safe operation of each event. This month, I will provide an overview of the major trunked radio networks that will be operational during the Olympics.

## Frequency Management and Coordination
As is common for large-scale events, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has delegated the task of radio frequency management and coordination to the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC). From December 1, 2001, through March 31, 2002, SLOC will coordinate all radio frequency use in the four designated radio zones: Salt Lake City, Park City, Ogden, and Provo. All broadcasters and organizations planning to use wireless audio, video, data communication, or other radio equipment must coordinate their frequency usage with SLOC.

## Public Safety and Security
Public safety personnel will also be heavily involved. The federal government has allocated approximately $200 million for security at the Olympic Winter Games, with additional funds potentially available after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The State of Utah has contributed $35 million, and SLOC has earmarked over $30 million for safety measures.

- **Secret Service**: Lead agency for security planning.
- **FBI**: Responsible for intelligence gathering and law enforcement response.
- **Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)**: In charge of consequence management.
- **Utah Olympic Public Safety Command (UOPSC)**: Coordinates state and local law enforcement activities.

Approximately 5,000 to 7,000 law enforcement officers, along with several thousand additional security personnel, will be deployed. Military personnel will also be on hand to provide assistance, ensuring a high level of public safety radio activity.

### Radio System Plan
SLOC, in collaboration with the State of Utah and the Utah Communications Agency Network (UCAN), has established a comprehensive plan for their radio system. Over 7,000 two-way radios are expected to be in use, operating in the 150 MHz and 800 MHz bands for both short-range and long-distance communication.

## Utah Communications Agency Network (UCAN)
UCAN, a quasi-governmental agency created by the Utah State Legislature in 1997, aims to transition various state, local, and private safety organizations from older, incompatible systems in the 150 MHz and 450 MHz bands to a common 800 MHz trunked radio network. Funding for the system comes from federal grants, state coffers, and monthly user fees ranging from $15 to $30 per radio, depending on the user's status as a state agency. Congress approved an additional $5 million for UCAN to upgrade security and communications equipment for law enforcement during the Olympics.

### Phase I Coverage
Phase I of the UCAN master plan provides coverage in Davis, Morgan, Salt Lake, Summit, Tooele, Utah, Wasatch, and Weber counties, covering about 80% of Utah's population.

## Valley Emergency Communications Center (VECC)
Located southwest of Salt Lake City in West Valley City, VECC provides dispatch services for 15 fire departments and 8 law enforcement agencies. It handles approximately 3,500 9-1-1 calls daily from 20 municipalities across a 120-square-mile area. VECC also serves as the headquarters for UCAN.

### Data Services
VECC offers data services to police, fire, and rescue units using Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) technology. Vehicles equipped with laptops and CDPD modems can access public safety databases, allowing officers to perform license checks and warrant requests without contacting a dispatcher. Future plans include "voiceless dispatch," where assignments are delivered via CDPD, freeing up officers and dispatchers from routine messages and providing more detailed information, such as mug shots and fingerprints, at the time of dispatch.

## UCAN SmartZone Network
The UCAN network is a Motorola Type II SmartZone system with multiple sites grouped into cells. Transmissions are simulcast from each site within a cell. Below is a compilation of the first eleven cells, which handle the majority of calls:

## Tooele, Utah
Tooele, located 45 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, is home to the Army's Desert Chemical Depot, which houses the world's largest single stockpile of chemical weapons. The depot operates a five-channel Motorola Type II system on the UHF frequencies: 406.350, 407.150, 407.950, 408.750, and 409.550 MHz.

## Computerized Talkgroup Logging
Scanning trunked frequencies often requires manually writing down each talkgroup that appears on the scanner display. A reader, David K5DMH, has developed a program for Bearcat 245XLT and 780XLT scanners to automate this process. The software, available for free, can be found at [http://personal.lig.bellsouth.net/lig/k/d/kd5eis/IDTracker/IDTracker.htm](http://personal.lig.bellsouth.net/lig/k/d/kd5eis/IDTracker/IDTracker.htm).
