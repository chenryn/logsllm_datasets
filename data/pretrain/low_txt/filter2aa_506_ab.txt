### SAP End-User and Back-End Security

#### SAP GUI Scripts - Prevention
1. **Disabling SAP GUI Scripts:**
   - If your organization does not require SAP GUI scripts, you can disable this functionality by setting the `sapgui/user_scripting` profile parameter to `FALSE`.

2. **Enabling SAP GUI Scripts with Restrictions:**
   - For organizations that need to use SAP GUI scripts, you can enable them but restrict their usage:
     - Set the `script/user_scripting_per_user` parameter to `TRUE`.
     - Assign the authorization object `S_SCR` with value `16` to only the users who are allowed to use this functionality.

3. **Client-Level Notifications:**
   - At the client level, ensure that the "Notify when a script attaches to SAP GUI" option is selected. This will provide a warning from the SAP GUI whenever a script attempts to execute.

### Ransomware and the Weaponization of Weaknesses

#### Chapter 04: Weaponization & Prevention

##### The Ransomware Approach
- **Initial Thoughts:**
  - After analyzing SAP systems exposed to the Internet, one recurring concern was the potential catastrophic impact of a ransomware attack on these systems.
  - To recommend effective countermeasures, we first needed to understand how an attacker might attempt to take over these assets.

- **Common Characteristics of Ransomware:**
  - Designed for maximum impact.
  - Prioritize quick lateral movement.
  - Do not prioritize stealth.
  - Often repurpose previously reported vulnerabilities.

##### Hypothetical Ransomware Scenario
- **Network Diagram:**
  - DMZ: Front-End SAP Java
  - Internal Network: Back-End SAP ABAP
  - Attacker

- **Ransomware Phases:**
  - **Intrusion:**
    - **Action:** Remote Command Execution via SAP Java Invoker Servlet.
    - **Countermeasure:** Implement SAP Notes 1445998, 1589525, and 1624450. Ensure the InvokerServlet is globally disabled using the SAP Java config-tool or Netweaver administrator webpage. Be aware of the known issue in SAP Note 1467771.
  - **Credential Gathering:**
    - **Action:** Decrypting SAP Secure Storage.
    - **Countermeasure:** Protect access to the SAP J2EE Secure Storage. Ensure files are accessible only by the SAP operating system user, local administrators, and global admins. Use a different encryption key phrase from the SAP master password and ensure the SAP Administrator password is different from the SAP database user.
  - **Lateral Movement:**
    - **Action:** SSH/Password Guessing/Brute-force via RFC.
    - **Countermeasure:** Follow the least privileged approach. Avoid using hardcoded credentials for RFC destinations. Review and restrict firewall rules to allow only necessary services.
  - **DMZ Escape:**
    - **Action:** Credential Reutilization using SOAPRFC/Master Password.
    - **Countermeasure:** Avoid using a single master password for all key accounts. Each account should have its own unique password.
  - **Ransom & Expansion:**
    - **Action:** Encrypt all data.
    - **Countermeasure:** Regularly patch and update your SAP systems. Conduct regular penetration testing and maintain audit trails.

##### Additional Considerations
- **Master Password:**
  - During installation, SAP suggests using a master password for key accounts. However, it is highly recommended to use unique passwords for each account to prevent a single point of failure.

- **Bonus Track:**
  - Once the DMZ is compromised, the malware can target adjacent networks by reusing obtained credentials and exploiting services like SOAPRFC. It may also send fake messages to end-users, prompting them to install malicious add-ons.

### Key Takeaways
- **Minimize Exposure:**
  - Only expose the bare minimum of your SAP system to the internet. Use an SAP Web-dispatcher to restrict access to unnecessary webpages.
- **Regular Patching:**
  - Keep your internet-facing SAP systems patched according to SAP's security notes release cycle (new patches available the second Tuesday of each month).
- **Audit Trails:**
  - Maintain comprehensive audit trails to aid in incident response.
- **Security Operations Center (SOC):**
  - Ensure your SOC is "SAP Aware" to effectively monitor and respond to threats.
- **Prevention:**
  - Conduct regular penetration testing, distrust default configurations, and always follow the least privileged approach.
