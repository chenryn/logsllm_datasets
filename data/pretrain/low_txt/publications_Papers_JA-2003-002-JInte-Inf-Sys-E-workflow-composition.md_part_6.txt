### Differences in Web Service Discovery and Integration

The operational metrics of web services are not taken into account when discovering services. Gonzalez-Castillo et al. (2001) use DAML + OIL to semantically describe web services. Their algorithm follows a similar approach to that of Paolucci et al. (2002). However, their system does not use DAML-S for the description of web services, as it was developed before its existence. Instead, they developed their own specification for web service description, but did not define inputs and outputs. As a result, the matching of web services is based on service descriptions, without considering inputs and outputs. Their approach does not target the discovery of web services based on operational metrics, nor does it address the web service integration problem.

Another approach that uses a specific language to describe service advertisements and requests is the LARKS (Language for Advertisement and Request for Knowledge Sharing) system (Sycara et al., 1999). The LARKS language can be seen as a precursor to the DAML-S specification. The system uses ontologies defined by a concept language (ITL). Their approach does not provide an automatic solution for computing the similarity of concepts defined in distinct ontologies. Additionally, the technique used to calculate the similarity of ontological concepts involves constructing a weighted associative network, where the weights indicate the belief in relationships. While they argue that the weights can be set automatically by default, it is clear that the construction of realistically weighted relationships requires human involvement, which becomes a challenging task when thousands of agents are involved. Their work does not consider the matchmaking of agent-based operational metrics. Although the output and input parameters of agents are compared using syntactic and semantic matching methods, the algorithm presented does not supply a mapping of potential connections between the outputs and inputs of two agents that yields maximum integration.

In the information retrieval area, Benjamins et al. (1998) present the (KA)² system, an ontology-based information retrieval system for the World-Wide Web. The system allows a community to build a knowledge base collectively, based on consensual knowledge, by populating a shared ontology. Using the shared ontology, a web crawler accesses web pages and infers answers. The use of ontologies has been shown to improve search from the perspectives of recall and precision, as well as ease of query formation. The OntoSeek project (Guarino et al., 1999) has also demonstrated that ontologies improve content-based searches, focusing on specific classes of information repositories such as yellow pages and product catalogs.

Ontologies have been employed as a common basis for information integration. They allow for the modeling of the semantic structure of individual information sources, as well as describing models of a domain independent of any particular information source. Several systems have been developed using this solution, including Carnot (Woelk et al., 1993), InfoSleuth (Bayardo et al., 1997), OBSERVER (Mena et al., 1996; Kashyap and Sheth, 1998), and COIN (Bressan et al., 1997). These projects differ from our work in the number of ontologies involved in the integration process and do not face the schema polarity problem (see Section 1 for a description of the schema polarity problem). Additionally, much of the work done is directed at solving schematic differences in multi-database systems (Kashyap and Sheth, 1996), and similar work is being addressed in addressing ontology mismatch (Noy and Musen, 2000; Klein, 2001).

### Conclusions

In this paper, we have presented a set of challenges that the emergence of web services and e-services has brought to organizations. While web services may sometimes be utilized in isolation, it is common to expect them to be integrated as part of workflow processes. This entails research in two areas: mechanisms to efficiently discover web services during an e-workflow composition process and to facilitate their subsequent integration with the e-workflow host.

We present a methodology and a set of algorithms for web service discovery based on three dimensions: syntax, operational metrics, and semantics. This approach allows for web service discovery not only based on functional requirements but also on operational metrics.

The need to discover workflow components based on operational metrics is more significant when web services are involved compared to traditional workflow tasks. The autonomy of web services does not allow users to identify their operational metrics at design time or prior to actual execution. Developing mechanisms for the discovery of web services based on operational metrics allows organizations to translate their vision into business processes more efficiently, as e-workflows can be designed according to QoS requirements, goals, and objectives.

To facilitate the discovery and subsequent integration of web services into workflows, we propose an approach based on the use of ontologies to describe workflow tasks and web service interfaces. Ontology-based approaches have already proven to be an important solution for information integration to achieve interoperability. During an e-workflow composition, there is a loss of information associated with web service task interfaces because a large part of the domain knowledge a developer employs when deploying a web service is not present at composition time.

In our work, we have devised an algorithm and implemented a prototype to discover and facilitate the resolution of structural and semantic differences during the integration process with an e-workflow. The algorithm uses a feature-based model to find similarities across workflow tasks and web service interfaces. The system determines and evaluates the best mapping between the outputs and inputs of a SO and the workflow host that yields the highest degree of integration.
