### Communicate through a Shared Event Log

The Cobalt Strike client can connect to multiple team servers. To initiate a new connection, go to **Cobalt Strike -> New Connection**. When connected to multiple servers, a switchbar will appear at the bottom of your Cobalt Strike window.

#### Figure 7: Server Switchbar
This switchbar allows you to switch between active Cobalt Strike server instances. Each server has its own button. Right-click a button and select **Rename** to customize the button’s text to reflect the role of the server during your engagement. The button name will also identify the server in the Cobalt Strike Activity Report.

When connected to multiple servers, Cobalt Strike aggregates listeners from all the connected servers. This aggregation allows you to send a phishing email from one server that references a malicious website hosted on another server. At the end of your engagement, Cobalt Strike’s reporting feature will query all the connected servers and merge the data to provide a comprehensive report.

### 1.6 Scripting Cobalt Strike
Cobalt Strike is scriptable through its Aggressor Script language, which is the spiritual successor to Armitage’s Cortana scripting language. However, the two languages are not compatible.

To manage scripts, go to **Cobalt Strike -> Script Manager**.

#### Figure 8: Script Manager
A default script within Cobalt Strike defines all of its popup menus and formats information displayed in the consoles. Using the Aggressor Script engine, you can override these defaults and customize Cobalt Strike to your preferences. You can also use Aggressor Script to add new features to Cobalt Strike’s Beacon and automate certain tasks.

For more information about Aggressor Script, consult its documentation at:

#### 2.3 Session and Target Visualizations
Cobalt Strike offers several visualizations designed to aid different aspects of your engagement. You can switch between visualizations using the toolbar or the **Cobalt Strike -> Visualization** menu.

##### Targets Table
The Targets Table displays the targets in Cobalt Strike’s data model, including their IP address, NetBIOS name, and any notes assigned by you or your team members. The icon to the left of a target indicates its operating system. A red icon with lightning bolts signifies that the target has an active Cobalt Strike Beacon session.

#### Figure 10: Cobalt Strike Targets View
- Click any table header to sort the hosts.
- Highlight a row and right-click it to bring up a menu with options for that host.
- Press **Ctrl + Alt** and click to select and deselect individual hosts.

The Targets Table is useful for lateral movement and understanding your target’s network.

##### Sessions Table
The Sessions Table shows which Beacons are communicating with this Cobalt Strike instance. Here, you will see the external and internal IP addresses, the egress listener, the last call time, and other information for each Beacon. The icon next to each row indicates the operating system of the compromised target. A red icon with lightning bolts indicates that the Beacon is running with administrator privileges, while a faded icon indicates that the Beacon session was asked to exit and acknowledged the command.

#### Figure 11: Cobalt Strike Beacon Management Tool
- If using a DNS Beacon listener, Cobalt Strike will not know anything about a host until it checks in for the first time. If you see an entry with only a last call time, you will need to give that Beacon its first task to see more information.
- Right-click one or more Beacons to see post-exploitation options.

##### Pivot Graph
Cobalt Strike can link multiple Beacons into a chain, where commands and output are relayed through the parent Beacon. This chaining is useful for controlling egress points and emulating disciplined actors who restrict communication paths. The Pivot Graph visualizes these chains.

#### Figure 12: Cobalt Strike Graph View
- Each Beacon session is represented by an icon indicating its operating system.
- A firewall icon represents the egress point of your Beacon payload.
- Dashed green lines indicate HTTP/HTTPS connections, and dashed yellow lines indicate DNS connections.
- An arrow connecting one Beacon to another represents a link. Orange arrows indicate named pipe channels, and blue arrows indicate TCP socket channels. Red (named pipe) or purple (TCP) arrows indicate broken links.
- Click a Beacon to select it. You can select multiple Beacons by clicking and dragging a box over the desired hosts. Use **Ctrl + Shift** to select or unselect an individual Beacon.
- Right-click a Beacon to bring up a menu with available post-exploitation options.

Several keyboard shortcuts are available in the Pivot Graph:
- **Ctrl + Plus** — Zoom in
- **Ctrl + Minus** — Zoom out
- **Ctrl + 0** — Reset zoom level
- **Ctrl + A** — Select all hosts
- **Escape** — Clear selection
- **Ctrl + C** — Arrange hosts into a circle
- **Ctrl + S** — Arrange hosts into a stack
- **Ctrl + H** — Arrange hosts into a hierarchy

Right-click the Pivot Graph with no selected Beacons to configure the layout. The Unlinked menu allows you to hide or show unlinked sessions.

#### 2.4 Tabs
Cobalt Strike opens each dialog, console, and table in a tab. Click the **X** button to close a tab. Use **Ctrl + D** to close the active tab, and **Ctrl + Shift + D** to close all tabs except the active one.

- Right-click the **X** button to open a tab in a window, take a screenshot, or close all tabs with the same name.
- **Ctrl + W** — Open the active tab in its own window
- **Ctrl + T** — Save a screenshot of the active tab
- **Ctrl + B** — Send the current tab to the bottom of the Cobalt Strike window
- **Ctrl + E** — Remove the tab from the bottom of the Cobalt Strike window
- **Shift + X** — Close all tabs with the same name
- **Shift + Ctrl + X** — Open the tab in its own window
- **Ctrl + Left** and **Ctrl + Right** — Quickly switch tabs
- Drag and drop tabs to change their order

#### 2.5 Consoles
Cobalt Strike provides a console for interacting with Beacon sessions, scripts, and chatting with teammates.

#### Figure 13: A Console Tab
- The console tracks your command history. Use the up and down arrows to cycle through previously typed commands.
- Use the **Tab** key to complete commands and parameters.
- **Ctrl + Plus** — Increase font size
- **Ctrl + Minus** — Decrease font size
- **Ctrl + 0** — Reset font size
- **Ctrl + F** — Search for text within the console
- **Ctrl + A** — Select all text in the console’s buffer

#### 2.6 Tables
Cobalt Strike uses tables to display sessions, credentials, targets, and other engagement information.

- Most tables have an option to assign a color highlight to the highlighted rows. These highlights are visible to other Cobalt Strike clients. Right-click and look for the **Color** menu.
- **Ctrl + F** — Show the table search panel to filter the current table.

#### Figure 14: Table with Search Panel
- Type your filter criteria in the text field. The format depends on the column you choose to apply the filter to. Use CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) and host ranges (192.168.1-192.169.200) for columns containing addresses. Use numbers or ranges for numeric columns and wildcard characters (*, ?) for string columns.
- **!** — Negate the current criteria
- **Enter** — Apply the specified criteria
- **Reset** — Remove the filters applied to the current table

### 3. Data Management

#### 3.1 Overview
Cobalt Strike’s team server acts as a broker for information collected during your engagement. Cobalt Strike parses output from its Beacon payload to extract targets, services, and credentials.

- Export Cobalt Strike’s data through **Reporting -> Export Data**. Options include TSV and XML formats. The export feature merges data from all connected team servers.

#### 3.2 Targets
Interact with Cobalt Strike’s target information through **View -> Targets**. This tab displays the same information as the Targets Visualization.

- **Import** — Import a file with target information. Cobalt Strike accepts flat text files (one host per line) and Nmap XML files (using the -oX option).
- **Add** — Add new targets to Cobalt Strike’s data model.

#### Figure 15: Add a Target
- Specify a range of IP addresses or use CIDR notation in the Address field to add multiple hosts at once.
- Hold **Shift** when clicking **Save** to keep the dialog open.
- Select one or more hosts and right-click to bring up the hosts menu to change notes, set operating system information, or remove hosts.

#### 3.3 Services
From the Targets display, right-click a host and select **Services** to open Cobalt Strike’s services browser. Here, you can browse services, assign notes, and remove service entries.

#### Figure 16: The Services Dialog

#### 3.4 Credentials
Go to **View -> Credentials** to interact with Cobalt Strike’s credential model.

- **Add** — Add an entry to the credential model. Hold **Shift** and press **Save** to keep the dialog open.
- **Copy** — Copy the highlighted entries to your clipboard.
- **Export** — Export credentials in PWDump format.

#### Figure 17: The Credential Model

#### 3.5 Maintenance
Cobalt Strike’s data model keeps all state and metadata in the `data/` folder, located in the directory from which you ran the team server.

- To clear the data model, stop the team server, delete the `data/` folder and its contents, and restart the server.
- To archive the data model, stop the team server, and use your preferred method to store the `data/` folder and its files elsewhere. To restore, stop the team server and replace the `data/` folder with the archived content.
- **Reporting -> Reset Data** — Resets Cobalt Strike’s Data Model without a team server restart.

### 4. Listener and Infrastructure Management

#### 4.1 Overview
Setting up infrastructure is the first step in any engagement. For Cobalt Strike, this includes team servers, redirectors, and DNS records. Once a team server is running, connect to it and configure it to receive connections from compromised systems. Listeners are used for this purpose.

A listener is both configuration information for a payload and a directive for Cobalt Strike to set up a server to receive connections from that payload. A listener consists of a user-defined name, the type of payload, and several payload-specific options.

#### 4.2 Listener Management
To manage Cobalt Strike listeners, go to **Cobalt Strike -> Listeners**. This will open a tab listing all configured payloads and listeners.

#### Figure 18: Listener Management Tab
- **Add** — Create a new listener
- **Edit** — Edit a listener
- **Remove** — Remove a listener

Ensure you give each listener a memorable name, as this is how you will refer to it through Cobalt Strike’s commands and workflows.

#### 4.3 Cobalt Strike’s Beacon Payload
Most commonly, you will configure listeners for Cobalt Strike’s Beacon payload, which models advanced attackers. Use Beacon to egress a network over HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS. You can also control peer-to-peer Beacons over Windows named pipes and TCP sockets.

Beacon supports asynchronous and interactive communication. Asynchronous communication is low and slow, with Beacon phoning home, downloading tasks, and going to sleep. Interactive communication happens in real-time.

Beacon’s network indicators are malleable. Use Cobalt Strike’s malleable C2 language to redefine Beacon’s communication, allowing you to cloak activity to look like other malware or blend in with legitimate traffic. Chapter 11 discusses this feature.

#### 4.4 Payload Staging
Payload staging is a background topic worth mentioning. Many attack frameworks decouple the initial exploit from the payload it executes. The payload is often divided into a stager and a stage. The stager is a small program that downloads the stage, injects it into memory, and passes execution to it. This process is called staging.

Staging is necessary in some offensive actions due to limitations on the amount of data that can be loaded and executed after successful exploitation. Cobalt Strike uses staging in user-driven attacks, such as those under **Attacks -> Packages** and **Attacks -> Web Drive-by**. The stagers used depend on the payload paired with the attack.

If you don’t need payload staging, you can turn it off by setting the `host_stage` option in your Malleable C2 profile to `false`. This prevents Cobalt Strike from hosting payload stages on its web and DNS servers, providing an OPSEC benefit.

In Cobalt Strike 4.0 and later, post-exploitation and lateral movement actions eschew stagers and deliver full payloads where possible. Disabling payload staging should not affect post-exploitation once you are ready.

#### 4.5 HTTP Beacon and HTTPS Beacon
The HTTP and HTTPS beacons download tasks with an HTTP GET request and send data back with an HTTP POST request. You have significant control over the configuration of these beacons, allowing for customization to fit your operational needs.
