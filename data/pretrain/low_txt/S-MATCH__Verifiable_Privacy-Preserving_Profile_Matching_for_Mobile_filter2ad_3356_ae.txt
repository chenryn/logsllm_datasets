## Computation and Communication Cost Analysis in Privacy-Preserving Profile Matching

### Figures and Analysis

**Figure 5.** The server computation cost under three datasets is shown in (a), (b), and (c). The communication cost of S-MATCH under the Infocom06, Sigcomm09, and Weibo datasets is presented in (d), (e), and (f).

- **(b) Computation cost of the server under Sigcomm09 dataset**
- **(c) Computation cost of the server under Weibo dataset**

**Computation Cost:**
- **Client Side:** The client-side computation cost of our scheme (PM and PM+V) is compared to that of homoPM [8] under the three real-world datasets. As the plaintext size increases, the encryption and data processing times for both schemes increase. In our profile matching scheme with verification, the key generation, which involves the RS Decoder and RSA-OPRF algorithms, contributes significantly to the computation cost when the plaintext size is small. This cost remains relatively stable as the plaintext size increases. For larger plaintext sizes (greater than 256 bits), the computation cost of our scheme is significantly lower than that of the homomorphic encryption-based scheme.
- **Server Side:** The server computation cost of our scheme (PM) is compared to that of homoPM [8] under the three real-world datasets. Homomorphic encryption, implemented using Paillier's cryptosystem [18], requires additional modular multiplication operations on the server after encryption, leading to higher computation costs. This includes offline computation (encryption) and online computation (modular multiplication on ciphertexts), which increases with the number of users and attributes. Our PPE-based scheme is more advantageous, especially with large datasets and plaintext sizes, due to its lower server computation cost.

**Communication Cost:**
- **Infocom06, Sigcomm09, and Weibo Datasets:** The communication cost of S-MATCH is evaluated between a mobile device and a PC. The user ID length is defined as 32 bits, and the number of query results is 5. The communication primarily occurs between the untrusted server and the users, involving the exchange of encrypted attribute values and profile matching results. The verification protocol introduces additional communication for authentication information. The communication cost under the Weibo dataset is higher due to the larger number of attributes. Our scheme is feasible for low-bandwidth scenarios.

### Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving profile matching scheme for large-scale mobile social networks. Our scheme is based on property-preserving encryption (PPE) and includes a key generation scheme to prevent key-sharing problems. We also demonstrate the necessity of entropy increase in social attribute data for achieving privacy. The security of PPE is evaluated over three real-world datasets, and a verification protocol is proposed to allow users to verify profile matching results without learning other users' profile attributes. Evaluation results indicate the efficiency and validity of our scheme. Future work will focus on improving the efficiency of order-preserving encryption (OPE) by designing an adaptive OPE scheme based on the entropy of social attributes.
