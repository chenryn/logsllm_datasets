## Abstract

Enterprises are increasingly adopting multi-cloud strategies, which involve end-to-end connectivity between multiple cloud providers (CPs). This trend is driven by the rapid expansion of global-scale private backbones by large CPs, a robust private peering fabric, and the emergence of new third-party private connectivity providers (e.g., DataPipe, HopOne). However, there is limited understanding of the performance, routing, and topological characteristics of these multi-cloud connectivity options. To address this, we conducted a cloud-centric measurement study of a coast-to-coast multi-cloud deployment, typical for a modern U.S. enterprise. We deployed VMs in two regions (VA and CA) across three major CPs (AWS, Azure, and GCP) and connected them using three different methods: (i) transit provider-based best-effort public Internet (BEP), (ii) third-party provider-based private (TPP) connectivity, and (iii) CP-based private (CPP) connectivity. Our active measurements provide insights into the variability in TPP performance, the stability of CPP performance and topology, and the absence of transit providers in CPP.

## 1. Introduction

Modern enterprises are rapidly adopting multi-cloud strategies, defined as end-to-end connectivity between multiple cloud providers (CPs). These strategies are essential for supporting distributed applications such as geographically distributed analytics and genome sequencing studies. Other benefits include competitive pricing, vendor independence, global reach, and data sovereignty. According to recent reports, over 85% of enterprises have already adopted multi-cloud strategies [39].

Two new trends in Internet connectivity are emerging due to the adoption of multi-cloud strategies. First, there is the rise of third-party private connectivity providers (TPPs) like DataPipe and HopOne, which offer direct, secure, and private Layer 3 connectivity between CPs at a monthly cost of a few hundred dollars. TPPs bypass the public Internet at Cloud Exchanges, allowing customers to form virtualized peering sessions with CPs without needing an Autonomous System Number (ASN) or physical infrastructure. Second, large CPs are expanding their infrastructures, including direct connect locations, where enterprises can access the cloud via private connectivity (CPP) using CP-specific interconnection services or third-party private connectivity providers at colocation facilities. Alternatively, multi-cloud users can rely on traditional best-effort connectivity over the public Internet (BEP).

## 2. Background and Related Work

The connectivity ecosystem of the Internet has been extensively studied, including router-level, POP-level, and AS-level mappings. Recent efforts have focused on the rise of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), the "flattening" of the Internet's peering structure, and the physical infrastructure of the Internet. With the advent of virtual private interconnections, large CPs have experienced significant growth in both ingress and midgress traffic, leading to the expansion of their presence at colocation facilities and the construction of private optical backbones. While previous research has compared the performance of CPs and their BEP properties, our study is one of the first to examine and characterize TPP, CPP, and BEP connectivity options from a cloud-to-cloud (C2C) perspective and elucidate their performance trade-offs and routing issues.

## 3. Measurement Methodology

### 3.1 Measurement Setting

We explore three types of multi-cloud connectivity options: TPP, CPP, and BEP. For TPP, we deploy cloud routers via a third-party connectivity providerâ€™s network, establishing a virtual circuit and BGP peering session. For CPP, participating CPs automatically select private peering locations. For BEP, we measure connectivity through the public Internet and towards Looking Glasses (LGs) in the colocation facility hosting our cloud routers.

### 3.2 Measurement Scenario and Cloud Providers

Our study focuses on a coast-to-coast, multi-cloud deployment in the U.S., involving AWS, Azure, and GCP. We deployed two cloud routers in Santa Clara, CA, and Ashburn, VA, interconnected with native cloud VMs from the three CPs. The cloud VMs are connected to cloud routers with 50 Mb/s links, and the cloud routers are interconnected with a 150 Mb/s link. Each cloud VM has at least 2 vCPU cores, 4 GB of memory, and runs Ubuntu server 18.04 LTS. We perform measurements between all CP VMs within and across regions, and between our cloud VMs and LGs in California and Virginia.

### 3.3 Data Collection and Performance Metrics

We conducted measurements over a month-long period in Spring 2019, with 10-minute rounds. In each round, we performed latency, path, and throughput measurements between all pairs of relevant nodes. Latency was measured using 10 ping probes paced in 1-second intervals. Paths were measured using 10 attempts of paris-traceroute. Throughput was measured using iperf3, configured to transmit data over a 10-second interval using TCP. We discarded the first 5 seconds to account for TCP's slow-start phase and considered the median throughput for the remaining 5 seconds. This resulted in approximately 48,000 samples of latency, path, and throughput measurements for each unique source-destination pair and connectivity option.

## 4. Results and Discussion

Our results show that CPP routes exhibit lower latency and higher stability compared to BEP and TPP routes. CPP also offers higher throughput with less variation. Despite the higher cost of TPP, its performance is inconsistent due to factors such as border routers, queuing delays, and higher loss rates. The superior performance of CPP is attributed to the private optical backbones of CPs, rich inter-CP connectivity, and the fact that CPs' traffic bypasses BEP transits. Our findings highlight the need for open measurement platforms and more transparency from multi-cloud connectivity providers.

## 5. Conclusion

This paper presents one of the first comparative characterizations of multi-cloud connectivity in today's Internet. We identify and discuss the issues, differences, and trade-offs associated with TPP, CPP, and BEP connectivity options. Our results underscore the critical need for open measurement platforms and greater transparency from multi-cloud connectivity providers. All relevant datasets will be released for independent validation, properly anonymized to remove TPP-related information.
