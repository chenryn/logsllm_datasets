### Traffic Manager Description and Rationale

#### Control: Minimum Required Permissions via RBAC
- **Control Severity:** Medium
- **Automated Fix Script Available:** No

**Description:**
All users and identities must be granted the minimum required permissions using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This ensures that users are provided with just enough permissions to perform their tasks, thereby minimizing the exposure of resources in the event of a user or service account compromise.

**Rationale:**
By leveraging the RBAC feature to grant only the necessary permissions, the risk of unauthorized access and potential damage is significantly reduced. This approach adheres to the principle of least privilege, enhancing overall security.

#### Control: Use HTTPS for Endpoint Monitoring
- **Control Severity:** Medium
- **Automated Fix Script Available:** Yes

**Description:**
The Traffic Manager profile should use the HTTPS protocol for endpoint monitoring. 

**Rationale:**
Using HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from various types of attacks, including man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking. This enhances the security of the communication between the Traffic Manager and the monitored endpoints.
