### COUNTS NINE THROUGH THIRTEEN
(18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 1343 - Fraud by Wire & Aiding and Abetting Fraud by Wire)

**THE GRAND JURY CHARGES THAT:**

98. The factual allegations in paragraphs 1 through 45 and 53 through 73 are re-alleged and incorporated as if set forth here in their entirety.

99. Beginning in at least September 2005 and continuing until January 19, 2012, in the Eastern District of Virginia and elsewhere, the defendants, KIM DOTCOM, MEGAUPLOAD LIMITED, VESTOR LIMITED, FINN BATATO, JULIUS BENCKO, SVEN ECHTERNACH, MATHIAS ORTMANN, ANDRUS NOMM, and BRAM VAN DER KOLK, knowingly devised and intended to devise a scheme to defraud and to obtain money by means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises.

100. It was part of the scheme that the defendants and others would mislead copyright holders into believing that their notifications of infringing copies of copyrighted works would result in the removal of the file or that access to the file would be disabled, when in fact, only the link(s) identified by the copyright holder would be disabled.

101. The scheme allowed infringing copies of copyrighted works to remain on the servers controlled by the Mega Conspiracy and accessible to members of the public (as long as at least one link remained unknown to the copyright holder providing the notification), and further allowed new links to the infringing copy to be created, even though the infringing copy had already been identified as infringing by the copyright holder.

102. It was further part of the scheme that the defendants and others would represent to copyright holders and others that repeat copyright infringers would have their user access terminated pursuant to terms of service announced by the Mega Conspiracy, when, in fact, repeat infringers were allowed to continue their infringement and at times even rewarded financially for it.

103. It was further part of the scheme that the Mega Conspiracy obtained advertising revenue as a result of the continued availability of files known to be infringing when members of the public were able to view and download them, and provided additional incentive for users to purchase premium subscriptions due to continuous access to infringing copies of copyrighted works.

104. It was further part of the scheme to defraud that the defendants and others misrepresented the Mega Conspiracy's Abuse Tool and notice-and-takedown procedure in various e-mails to copyright holders and others, including:
- Notification through the Abuse Tool would "remove a batch of files from [Mega's] servers."
- The takedown process enabled copyright holders to "take down illegal content in real time."
- The Mega Conspiracy would be "taking great care in expeditiously deleting any material reported to [them] through DMCA takedown notices."
- The "takedown tool" would "remove" videos and/or files "from our system immediately."
- The Abuse Tool granted copyright holders "direct deletion rights," allowing them to "take files and films offline immediately."
- Megavideo was "one of the few online video communities that make it impossible to fraudulently host full-length feature movies due to a human-assisted automatic detection/deletion mechanism."
- Identifying a URL link to infringing material through the Abuse Tool would "take down material from Megavideo."

105. On or about the dates listed below, in the Eastern District of Virginia and elsewhere, the defendants, KIM DOTCOM, MEGAUPLOAD LIMITED, VESTOR LIMITED, FINN BATATO, and others, engaged in the above-described fraudulent activities.
