**System Accessibility:**
The system may take up to 1 minute to become accessible again.

**Obtaining Information from Listing 376:**
To demonstrate how to obtain information from Listing 376, we will connect to the target system using `netcat` and execute the `whoami` command to retrieve the username and hostname.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ nc 192.168.50.220 4444
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.22000.318]
(c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
C:\Users\dave> whoami
clientwk220\dave
C:\Users\dave>
```

**Listing 377 - Connect to the Bind Shell and Obtain Username and Hostname:**
The output of Listing 377 indicates that we have command execution as the user `dave`. The hostname `clientwk220` suggests that our bind shell is running on a client system rather than a server. The hostname can often provide insights into the purpose and type of the machine, such as `WEB01` for a web server or `MSSQL01` for an MSSQL server.

**Checking Group Memberships:**
Next, we will check which groups `dave` belongs to by using the `whoami /groups` command.

```bash
C:\Users\dave> whoami /groups
GROUP INFORMATION
-----------------
Group Name                  Type             SID                                  Attributes
=================================================================================================
Everyone                    Well-known group S-1-1-0                             Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
CLIENTWK220\helpdesk        Alias            S-1-5-21-2309961351-4093026482-2223492918-1008 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
BUILTIN\Remote Desktop Users Alias            S-1-5-32-555                         Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
BUILTIN\Users               Alias            S-1-5-32-545                         Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
NT AUTHORITY\BATCH          Well-known group S-1-5-3                             Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group

NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users Well-known group S-1-5-11                        Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
...
```

**Listing 378 - Group Memberships of User `dave`:**
The output shows that `dave` is a member of the `helpdesk` group, which typically has additional permissions compared to standard users. Additionally, `dave` is a member of `BUILTIN\Remote Desktop Users`, allowing RDP access. Other groups, such as `Everyone` and `BUILTIN\Users`, are standard for non-privileged users.

**Enumerating Local Users:**
To list all local users on the system, we can use the `Get-LocalUser` cmdlet in PowerShell.

```powershell
C:\Users\dave> powershell
Windows PowerShell
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
Install the latest PowerShell for new features and improvements!
https://aka.ms/PSWindows
PS C:\Users\dave> Get-LocalUser

Name         Enabled Description
----         ------- -----------
Administrator False  Built-in account for administering the computer/domain
BackupAdmin  True
dave         True    dave
daveadmin    True
DefaultAccount False  A user account managed by the system.
Guest        False   Built-in account for guest access to the computer/domain
offsec       True
steve        True
...
```

**Listing 379 - Display Local Users on `CLIENT220`:**
The output reveals several interesting items:
- The built-in `Administrator` account is disabled.
- Regular users `steve` and `dave` exist.
- Two other users, `daveadmin` and `BackupAdmin`, are identified, with usernames suggesting they are administrative accounts.

**Enumerating Local Groups:**
To list the existing groups on `CLIENTWK220`, we can use the `Get-LocalGroup` cmdlet in PowerShell.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\dave> Get-LocalGroup

Name            Description
----            -----------
adminteam       Members of this group are admins to all workstations on the second floor
BackupUsers
helpdesk
...
Administrators  Administrators have complete and unrestricted access to the computer/domain
...
Remote Desktop Users  Members in this group are granted the right to logon remotely
...
```

**Listing 380 - Display Local Groups on `CLIENT220`:**
- The `adminteam` group is of interest, as it contains the string "admin" and has a custom description indicating administrative privileges on the second floor.
- The `BackupUsers` group, along with the `BackupAdmin` user, suggests extensive file system permissions.
- Built-in groups like `Administrators`, `Backup Operators`, `Remote Desktop Users`, and `Remote Management Users` also provide valuable information.

**Reviewing Group Members:**
To review the members of `adminteam` and `Administrators`, we can use the `Get-LocalGroupMember` cmdlet.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\dave> Get-LocalGroupMember adminteam

ObjectClass Name            PrincipalSource
----------- ----            ---------------
User        CLIENTWK220\daveadmin Local

PS C:\Users\dave> Get-LocalGroupMember Administrators

ObjectClass Name            PrincipalSource
----------- ----            ---------------
User        CLIENTWK220\Administrator Local
User        CLIENTWK220\daveadmin     Local
User        CLIENTWK220\backupadmin   Local
User        CLIENTWK220\offsec        Local
```

**Listing 381 - Display Members of the `adminteam` Group:**
- Only `daveadmin` is a member of `adminteam`.
- `daveadmin` and `BackupAdmin` are members of the `Administrators` group, making them highly valuable targets.

**Summarizing Collected Information:**
- Our bind shell runs as `dave` on `CLIENTWK220`.
- `dave` is in the `helpdesk` group.
- Another user, `daveadmin`, is likely the privileged account.
- `daveadmin` is in the `adminteam` group, which has administrative privileges on the second floor.
- `daveadmin` and `BackupAdmin` are local administrators.

**Gathering System Information:**
Next, we will gather information about the operating system, version, and architecture using the `systeminfo` command.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\dave> systeminfo

Host Name: CLIENT220
OS Name: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro
OS Version: 10.0.22000 N/A Build 22000
...
System Type: x64-based PC
...
```

**Listing 382 - Information About the Operating System and Architecture:**
- The system is running Windows 11 Pro, build 22000 (version 21H2).
- It is a 64-bit system.

**Network Information:**
To identify network interfaces, routes, and active connections, we can use the `ipconfig /all` and `route print` commands.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\dave> ipconfig /all
