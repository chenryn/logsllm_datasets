### Abstract
This study investigates the security threats posed by abandoned Internet resources used by Android apps. We define "abandoned" as Internet resources that support published and available apps but have not been maintained, making them vulnerable to exploitation. These resources include domain names and hard-coded IP addresses, which can be used for malicious activities such as stealing sensitive information, scamming, phishing, click fraud, and malware distribution. Our analysis of 1.1 million Android apps from the official marketplace identified 3,628 abandoned Internet resources associated with 7,331 apps. Among these, 13 apps have been installed over a million times, indicating a significant threat. Based on our empirical findings, we discuss potential threats and propose countermeasures.

### Introduction
Mobile applications (apps) often rely on Internet resources to provide rich features such as voice recognition, real-time cryptocurrency charts, and personalized weather notifications. These resources, including domain names and public IP addresses, are typically managed by app developers or third-party providers. However, once an app is published, developers often neglect to maintain these resources, leading to their abandonment. This poses a significant security risk, as abandoned resources can be hijacked and used for malicious purposes.

Previous studies have explored the threats of abandoned Internet resources, but none have specifically addressed the context of mobile apps and their users. Our study aims to fill this gap by conducting a large-scale empirical analysis of abandoned Internet resources used by Android apps. We found that 3,628 such resources were associated with 7,331 apps, with 13 of these apps having over one million installations. We also observed that personally identifiable information, such as device IDs and geolocation data, was being transmitted through these abandoned resources.

### Contributions
- **New Security Problem**: We highlight a new security issue related to abandoned Internet resources in the context of mobile platforms and their users.
- **Empirical Study**: Our large-scale study reveals the prevalence of this threat, identifying 3,628 abandoned resources used by 7,331 apps, with 13 apps having over one million installations.
- **Traffic Analysis**: We observed significant traffic from Android and cross-platform users, including the transmission of personally identifiable information.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: We discuss potential countermeasures and ethical considerations for addressing this problem.

### Background
#### 2.1 Internet-Assisted Apps
Mobile apps often use Internet resources to provide enhanced features. These resources can be categorized into private services managed by the app developer and public services managed by third-party providers. Private services are backend services supporting the main functions of the app, while public services are provided by third-party libraries or open services.

#### 2.2 Hijack-able Internet Resources
Internet resources used by mobile apps can be hijacked if they are abandoned. This includes expired domains, parked domains, and dangling records (Dare). Expired domains can be re-registered by attackers, parked domains can be purchased, and Dare refers to valid domains pointing to non-functional resources.

#### 2.3 Widespread Impact
The impact of hijacking varies depending on the resource owner. For private services, the attacker can control all apps connected to the service. For third-party libraries, the attacker can affect all apps using the library. For third-party services, the impact depends on the specific service and its usage.

### Methodology
#### 3.1 Dataset
We used the Playdrone dataset, which contains over 1.1 million free Android apps from Google Play in 2014. We selected apps that required Internet permission and were still available on Google Play. We confirmed the availability and version consistency of these apps to ensure they had not been updated since 2014.

### Conclusion
Our study highlights the significant security risks posed by abandoned Internet resources used by Android apps. By conducting a large-scale empirical analysis, we identified numerous instances of these resources and discussed the potential threats and mitigation strategies. Further research is needed to develop more robust solutions to address this emerging security issue.
