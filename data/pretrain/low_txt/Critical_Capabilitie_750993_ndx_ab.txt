### Context and Use Cases

Given the increased adoption of hybrid and multicloud technologies to support digital transformation initiatives, APM and observability software solutions have become critical to the success of a growing set of stakeholders in IT, software development, and the business. These solutions help organizations improve UX, shorten mean time to repair (MTTR), improve service availability, detect anomalous application behavior, and forecast future problems. They also provide critical data that is useful outside a purely IT operations context, including insight into the impact that performance has on customer behavior and business processes.

**Critical Capabilities:**

- **Business Analysis:** Identifies the health of the organization with respect to KPIs, including financial metrics. Business processes describe and track the flow and status across the underlying infrastructure.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Determines the probable cause of a problem and constructs a causality chain linking cause and effect.
- **IT Service/Infrastructure Monitoring:** Reflects whether agreed-on commitments regarding responsiveness and uptime are being met, including adherence to SLAs, OLAs, and SLOs.
- **ADDP (Application Debugging and Distributed Profiling):** Identifies sources of defects and errors in computer and program code and mitigates performance degradation.
- **RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection):** Provides an additional layer in a defense-in-depth strategy by identifying and blocking attempts to exploit vulnerable components.
- **Behavior Analysis:** Facilitates the discovery and classification of user and application behavior through guided or ad hoc access to raw telemetry.

**Use Cases:**

- **IT Operations:** Tasked with keeping the infrastructure operating efficiently.
- **Security Operations:** Maximizes organizational resilience against business risks, threats, and exposure, and enables prevention, detection, and response.
- **Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM):** Monitors availability, performance, and experience quality as end users interact with applications and supporting infrastructure.
- **DevOps/AppDev:** Rapidly assesses the quality and effectiveness of recent releases to detect and diagnose issues quickly.
- **Application Owner/Line of Business:** Interested in APM technologies to make business decisions based on business metrics and customer journeys.
- **SRE/Platform Operations:** Manages cloud-native applications and is responsible for their performance and availability, often combining DevOps and traditional ITOps skills.
