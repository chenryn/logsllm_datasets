#### Introduction to Cognitive Radio
- **Radio**
- **Software Defined Radio (SDR)**
- **Cognitive Radio (CR)**
- **Cognitive Radio Network (CRN)**

#### Key Components of Cognitive Radio
- **Cognitive Engine**: The brain of the CR system that makes decisions based on environmental conditions.
- **Center Frequency**: The frequency at which the radio operates.
- **Bandwidth**: The range of frequencies available for transmission.
- **Transmit Power**: The power level used for transmission.
- **Type of Modulation**: The method used to encode information onto a carrier signal.
- **Coding Rate**: The rate at which data is encoded.
- **Channel Access Protocol**: The rules for accessing and sharing the communication channel.
- **Encryption Algorithm**: The method used to secure data.
- **Frame Size**: The size of the data packets transmitted.

#### Attacks Specific to Cognitive Radio Networks
- **Modification of Cognitive Messages**: Altering the messages sent through the network.
- **Incumbent on Channel 6**: Simulating an incumbent user on channel 6.
- **Incumbent on Channel 1**: Simulating an incumbent user on channel 1.
- **Routing Disruption**: Interfering with the routing process.
- **Sybil Attack**: Creating multiple fake identities to disrupt the network.
- **Priority Attack**: Manipulating the priority of users or messages.
- **Attacks on Cryptography**: Targeting the encryption mechanisms.
- **Attacks on Data Privacy**: Compromising the privacy of the data.
- **Primary User Emulation (PUE)**: Mimicking a primary user to gain unauthorized access.

#### Countermeasures
- **Cooperative Intrusion Detection**: Collaborative detection of intrusions.
- **Device Reputation**: Maintaining a reputation system for devices.
- **Device Location**: Using location-based services to verify device authenticity.

#### Why This Matters
- **Tools and Equipment**
  - **Frequency Range**: 30 MHz to 4.4 GHz
  - **Power Output**: 60 mW
  - **SimpliciTI**: Fits Arduino shields
  - **Cost**: ~$100 in quantity
  - **MyriadRF**: $300
  - **HackRF**: $300 (by Michael Ossmann)
  - **BladeRF**: $420 (by Nuand)
