### Concerns and Threats of Virtual Reality and Computer Vision in Authentication Systems

A growing concern is the increasing threat posed by virtual reality (VR) and computer vision as potential adversarial tools. It appears that the designers of face authentication systems have assumed a relatively weak adversarial model, where attackers are presumed to have limited technical skills and access only to inexpensive materials. This assumption is, at best, risky.

Unfortunately, VR technology is rapidly becoming more commonplace, affordable, and user-friendly. Additionally, the visualizations produced by VR are becoming increasingly convincing, making it easier to create realistic 3D environments that can deceive visual security systems. As a result, we believe that future authentication mechanisms must proactively anticipate and adapt to the rapid advancements in the virtual and online realms.

### Appendix: Multi-Image Facial Model Estimation

In Section 3.2, we describe how to associate 2D facial landmarks with corresponding 3D points on an underlying facial model. Contour landmarks pose a significant challenge for this 2D-to-3D correspondence problem because the associated set of 3D points for these features is dependent on the pose. Zhu et al. [63] address this issue by modeling contour landmarks with parallel curved line segments and iteratively optimizing head orientation and 2D-to-3D correspondence. For a specific head orientation \( R_j \), the corresponding landmark points on the 3D model are found using an explicit function based on rotation angle:

\[ s_{i,j} = f_j P R_j (S_{i',j} + t_j) \]
\[ S_{i',j} = \bar{S}_{i'} + A_{id} \alpha_{id} \]
\[ i' = \text{land}(i, R_j) \]
\[ \alpha_{id} = \alpha_{id} + A_{\text{exp}} \alpha_{\text{exp}} \]

However, this approach yields inferior results when multiple input images are used, especially for corner landmarks. Therefore, we adopt a different approach from Zhu et al. [63] and use Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation to compute the 3D facial model. We assume that the alignment error of each 3D landmark independently follows a Gaussian distribution. The most probable parameters \(\theta := (\{f_j\}, \{R_j\}, \{t_j\}, \{\alpha_{\text{exp}}^j\}, \alpha_{id})\) can be estimated by minimizing the cost function:

\[ \theta = \arg\max_{\theta} \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^M \frac{1}{(\sigma_s^i)^2} \| s_{i,j} - f_j P R_j (S_{i',j} + t_j) \|^2 + \sum_{j=1}^M \alpha_{\text{exp}}^{jT} \Sigma_{\text{exp}}^{-1} \alpha_{\text{exp}}^j + \alpha_{id}^T \Sigma_{id}^{-1} \alpha_{id} \right\} \]

Here, \( S_{i',j} \) is computed using Equation (6). \(\Sigma_{id}\) and \(\Sigma_{\text{exp}}\) are covariance matrices of \(\alpha_{id}\) and \(\alpha_{\text{exp}}\), which can be obtained from a pre-existing face model. \((\sigma_s^i)^2\) is the variance of the alignment error of the \(i\)-th landmark and is derived from a separate training set consisting of 20 images with hand-labeled landmarks. The cost function in Equation (7) can be efficiently computed, leading to the estimated identity weight \(\alpha_{id}\), with which we can compute the neutral-expression model \( S_i (= \bar{S}_{i'} + A_{id} \alpha_{id}) \).
