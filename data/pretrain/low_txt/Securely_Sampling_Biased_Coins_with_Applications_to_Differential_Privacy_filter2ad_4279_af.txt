### d-Sample Wall-clock, East-West

**MNM (ε = 2⁻³ ln 2)**
- δ = 2⁻⁶⁰
- MNM (ε = 0.1)
- ODO (ε = 0.1, 2⁻³ ln 2)
- δ = 2⁻⁸⁰

**Figure 3: d-Sample Benchmark Results**
We measured the time and communication required to produce \(d\) samples from a geometric distribution \(Geo(2/ε)\) in two network settings. In these graphs, \(d\) varies for two choices of \(ε\) and two values of \(δ\) for each \(ε\). Note that the ODO method does not change based on the form of \(ε\), so we use a single plot for the two values of \(ε\). Across all parameters, the MNM technique outperforms the ODO method. In graph (c), the gray lines represent the same MNM performance lines from graph (a) for comparison purposes.
