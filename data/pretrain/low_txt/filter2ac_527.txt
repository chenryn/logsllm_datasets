**ATT&CK ID:** T1006  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Direct Volume Access

Adversaries may use direct volume access to bypass file access controls and file system monitoring. On Windows, programs can be granted direct access to logical volumes, allowing them to read and write files directly from the drive by analyzing file system data structures. This technique circumvents both Windows file access controls and file system monitoring tools, enabling adversaries to manipulate files without triggering security mechanisms.
