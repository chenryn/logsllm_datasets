### Limitations on Flexibility and Traffic Engineering

Restricting the use of more specific routes can limit network flexibility, particularly in scenarios where traffic engineering or rerouting through DDoS mitigation services is necessary. These situations often require the announcement of more specific routes at unpredictable times. Authorizing such announcements just in time may not be practical, as it takes time for new Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) to be published and validated. Additionally, routers may not immediately use the updated Validated ROA Payloads (VRPs), as some operators update their static filter lists only every 24 hours.

### Trade-offs in Network Security and Flexibility

Operators must consider a trade-off between security and flexibility. Strictly speaking, networks are more secure against malicious hijacks when more specific routes are not allowed. However, this also means that legitimate traffic engineering will be indistinguishable from such hijacks. If an operator never uses traffic engineering, the decision is straightforward. For networks that do use traffic engineering regularly, allowing more specific routes may be necessary. While this increases vulnerability to malicious attacks, it still provides protection against accidental hijacks, which are more common.

This balance will continue to be a point of discussion among operators until practical path verification mechanisms are available. Currently, operators rely on out-of-band mechanisms, such as Peering DB, to assess the plausibility and validity of BGP paths.

### RPKI and Path Validity

The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) standards include a specification for BGPsec, which makes entire BGP paths verifiable. Unfortunately, BGPsec has not been widely deployed due to several challenges. For instance, BGPsec requires participation from every Autonomous System (AS) on a path and cryptographic signing and validation by BGP speakers, which is currently supported by only a few BGP software solutions like Quagga and Bird.

To address these issues, the SIDROPS working group in the IETF is considering a pragmatic approach with two new drafts. The proposal involves allowing any AS to publish a list of ASes they authorize to advertise their routes, known as Autonomous System Provider Authorizations (ASPAs). This allows routers to validate adjacencies in a BGP path and reject any path where an unauthorized adjacency is present. This approach mitigates concerns around using the MaxLength attribute in VRPs, as spoofing the origin AS becomes more detectable with ASPA objects.

Furthermore, the ASPA approach supports incremental adoption. If no ASPA object is published for an AS, any adjacency is simply unknown rather than invalid. This encourages individual ASes to protect themselves by publishing ASPA objects, and the more ASes participate, the better BGP is protected overall.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we examined the deployment and evolution of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) over the past eight years. RPKI has seen significant deployment, with 12.1% of the global IPv4 address space now covered by ROAs. Our analysis showed that data quality has improved dramatically, with over 94.3% of announcements covered by ROAs being valid.

While misconfigurations still occur, RPKI is highly successful in filtering out unauthorized BGP updates. We believe RPKI is ready for broader adoption, and operators can start relying on it to drop invalid announcements. Prominent operators, such as AT&T, have already begun dropping invalids, and common practices are emerging in the operator community.

### Future Work

Currently, there is no reliable way to detect if an announcement is actually malicious. Existing systems like BGPStream use heuristics for this purpose. As RPKI coverage expands and data quality improves, invalid announcements detected by RPKI may become a valuable source of evidence of malicious intent. Observations in this paper suggest that malicious announcements have a shorter lifetime than actual misconfigurations, which could help in identifying hijacks.
