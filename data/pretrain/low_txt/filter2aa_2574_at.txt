#### 5.3. Collecting Local Copy of Target Facebook Data
If you are collecting evidence from Facebook for a lawsuit, it is crucial to save a copy of your findings. Facebook content can be deleted or made private at any time. You can save a page using your browser's "Save Page As" feature, print the page, or take a screen capture.

For OSINT analysts, an offline version of the target’s Facebook data is essential for advanced analysis or report creation. The ExtractFace tool, available at http://le-tools.com, automates the extraction of data from Facebook profiles. Here are the steps to use this tool:

1. **Download the Tool**: Download ExtractFace from https://sourceforge.net/projects/extractface/?source=typ_redirect.
2. **Prerequisites**:
   - Use Firefox ESR edition (download from https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/).
   - Install the MozRepl add-on (available at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mozrepl/). Start it or set the “Activate on startup” option.
   - Ensure you have a valid Facebook account and are signed in.
3. **Configure Firewall**: Deactivate your firewall or allow connections to port 4242 before using the tool.
4. **Launch Options Menu**: Go to the target’s profile, right-click the ExtractFace icon in the Windows taskbar, and select the options menu (see Figure 5-20).
5. **Scroll and Expand**: Use the "Scroll and Expand" option to scroll through the entire page before harvesting data to avoid partial results.
6. **Harvest Data**: For example, to harvest a target’s friend list, go to their Facebook friend page, click "Scroll and Expand," and then "Dump Friends." Select the location to store the dump files and click "Dump now" (see Figure 5-21).
