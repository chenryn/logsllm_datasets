### Periodicity and Webmail Server Identification

We believe that the fundamental concept behind our approach can generally be applied to differentiate between user- and machine-initiated traffic. Consequently, a wide range of other applications are likely to exhibit characteristic fingerprints related to flow timing (our preliminary results already suggest this).

### 4. Evaluation

The results from the previous section (Section 3) are promising, as they indicate the feasibility of distinguishing between email-related web traffic and other HTTPS traffic by leveraging correlations across protocols and time. In this section, we detail how to build a classifier using the proposed features and present initial results. Our primary goal is not to achieve maximum accuracy but to demonstrate the general feasibility and potential of our approach in a proof-of-concept study.

#### General Approach

We use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) library provided by [4]. For classification, we rely on the four features introduced in Section 3: service proximity, activity profiles, session duration, and periodicity. These features are used to distinguish between two classes: mail and non-mail. To estimate classification accuracy, we employ 5-fold cross-validation. We partition the set of hosts into five complementary subsets of equal size. Four subsets are used for training, and the remaining subset serves as validation data. This process is repeated five times, ensuring each subset is used exactly once as validation data.

#### Classification Results

Using the top500 dataset (see Table 1), we classify webmail hosts within the SWITCH network.

| **Classified As** | **Mail** | **Non-Mail** | **Accuracy (Mean)** |
|------------------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **True HTTPS Mail Servers** | 61 | 16 | 93.2% (±3) |
| **Non-Mail Servers** | 16 | 382 | - |

**Table 2: Classification of internal HTTPS servers.**

As shown in Table 2, our classification achieves a mean accuracy of 93.2% (with a standard deviation of 3.0) across the five runs of 5-fold cross-validation. The precision for the mail class is 79.2%, which is reasonable given the reliance solely on flow data. Further optimization of the classifier could improve this precision. Manual scrutiny of the classification results reveals that our classifier effectively distinguishes between webmail and Skype nodes, primarily due to the service proximity feature (Section 3.1), and between webmail and authentication services, mainly due to the session duration feature (Section 3.2.2). However, distinguishing between VPN and webmail servers remains challenging, leading to some false negatives when classifying webmail hosts.

Popular webmail platforms like GMail, Yahoo!, and Hotmail do not maintain servers within the SWITCH network and have thus been excluded from our discussion and analysis so far. We briefly illustrate that our approach can also uncover arbitrary webmail applications, regardless of whether the hosts are internal or external.

To this end, we extract additional data from our trace collected in March 2010. Following the methodology outlined in Section 2, we select 500 popular external HTTPS hosts/sockets. Manually labeling this dataset reveals 32 GMail servers. For the remaining 452 HTTPS servers, we established that they provide other non-mail services such as online banking, updates, and Facebook login servers.

We merge the original top500 dataset with the labeled external hosts, creating a new dataset with 1000 HTTPS servers. Using our proposed features, we build a classifier and again apply 5-fold cross-validation.

| **Classified As** | **Mail** | **Non-Mail** | **Accuracy (Mean)** |
|------------------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **True HTTPS Mail Servers** | 94 | 19 | 94.8% (±3) |
| **Non-Mail Servers** | 30 | 820 | - |

**Table 3: Classification of internal and external HTTPS servers.**

Table 3 shows that we can classify both internal and external HTTPS servers with an overall accuracy of 94.8% ± 3 and a precision of 75.8% for the mail class. Although these results are preliminary, they suggest that it is possible to detect mail servers outside the SWITCH network using the same features, even with only a small sample of their total traffic visible in our network. Our case study on GMail indicates that the techniques proposed in this paper are not limited to specific applications (e.g., Outlook Web Access, Horde).

### 5. Related Work

Extensive research has focused on traffic classification, but only a small portion has studied methods for dissecting WWW traffic. Schneider et al. [29] extracted traffic to four popular Ajax-based sites from full packet traces and characterized differences between Ajax and HTTP traffic. Li et al. used manually constructed payload signatures to classify HTTP traffic into 14 applications and discussed trends from the early analysis [18] of two datasets collected three years apart. Compared to previous studies, our work focuses on extracting mail traffic from WWW traces and operates on flows, addressing a more challenging problem than previous HTTP classification studies, which used full packet traces (e.g., [8]).

Some recent research has focused on the traffic characteristics of mail. Ramachandran et al. [26] characterized several network properties of spammers, emphasizing that while spammers can alter the content of spam to evade filters, they cannot easily change their network-level footprint. This work suggested the plausibility of network-based spam filtering and was followed by the SNARE system [10], which uses a few simple traffic features to block spammers with reasonable accuracy.

Compared to host-based classification, the novelty of our method lies in the addition of two "dimensions": (i) we introduce a timing dimension, as it contains valuable information about user- and machine-behaviors; (ii) while earlier host-based approaches [14] attempt to identify a common communication pattern shared by all hosts of an application, we try to correlate the unknown host behavior to known hosts running a different, but related application, allowing hosts with different patterns to be validly identified under one class.

### 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented several flow-level techniques for separating webmail traffic from other HTTPS traffic. The novelty of our approach lies in two main directions: (i) leveraging correlations across related protocols (e.g., IMAP, POP, SMTP, and webmail) and among hosts sharing a similar client base, and (ii) identifying and exploiting the timing characteristics of webmail applications. Based on these, we introduced novel features, investigated their efficiency on a large flow dataset, and used them to produce preliminary classification results on internal and external HTTPS servers. This is the first work to show that it is possible to uncover HTTPS webmail applications solely based on flow-level data with approximately 93.2% accuracy and 79.2% precision.

While the main focus of this paper has been the presented novel features, future work will aim to optimize the classifier and, if necessary, extend our set of features to improve classification precision. We also plan to test the effect of sampling on our techniques, as we believe most of the features presented are likely immune to sampling. Furthermore, we believe our features are of broader interest for traffic classification and could be used, for example, to facilitate demultiplexing of HTTP(S) traffic in general. Finally, with a reliable method to extract webmail traffic, we intend to perform an extensive characterization of the long-term evolution of mail-related traffic, including usage trends and the mix between classical delivery and web-mail protocols.
