## Abstract
Recent research on intrusion tolerance has demonstrated that resilience to sophisticated network attacks necessitates the deployment of system replicas across at least three geographically distributed sites. While commodity data centers offer a cost-effective and manageable solution for hosting these sites, their use raises significant confidentiality concerns. System operators may be reluctant to expose private data or proprietary algorithms to servers outside their direct control.

We introduce a new model for Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) replicated systems that moves toward "intrusion tolerance as a service." In this model, application logic and data are only exposed to servers hosted on the system operator's premises. Additional offsite servers, hosted in data centers, can support the required resilience without executing application logic or accessing unencrypted state. We have implemented this approach in the open-source Spire system, and our evaluation shows that the performance overhead of providing confidentiality is less than 4% in terms of latency.

## I. Introduction
Intrusion tolerance, the ability to operate correctly even when partially compromised by an attacker, is a critical concern for high-value systems such as power grid Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). These systems are often targets for sophisticated nation-state-level attacks, leading to extensive research on making them intrusion-tolerant through BFT replication of control servers (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]).

While this research has produced solutions with strong correctness and performance guarantees, deploying and managing these systems remains challenging. Tools like BFT-SMaRt [6], [7] have been developed to simplify this process, but a high level of expertise is still required. For utility operators, it is impractical to develop and maintain this expertise in-house [8], and similar challenges exist in other domains.

Further complicating deployment, recent work indicates that resilience to sophisticated network attacks, which can isolate a targeted site from the rest of the network, requires a significantly higher number of system replicas, deployed across at least three geographically distributed sites [4]. Commodity data centers offer a cost-effective and manageable solution for constructing and operating these additional sites. However, using these data centers raises significant confidentiality concerns [8]: system operators may consider exposing private data or proprietary algorithms to external servers unacceptable.

We propose a new model for BFT systems that moves toward "intrusion tolerance as a service." In this model, application logic and data are only exposed to servers hosted on the system operator's premises. The intrusion-tolerant system architecture can be designed by a service provider, with additional offsite servers hosted in data centers managed by the service provider to provide the necessary resilience. These offsite servers participate in the BFT replication protocol but do not execute application logic and only store encrypted state and updates. Our approach provides the same resilience to system compromises and network attacks as in [4], without exposing application state and logic to data center replicas.

We implement our new partially cloud-based architecture and protocols in Confidential Spire, a SCADA system for the power grid based on Spire 1.2 [4], [9]. Our evaluation in an emulated power grid SCADA setup shows that Confidential Spire adds an overhead of about 2ms compared to Spire 1.2 when tolerating one intrusion (less than 4% increase in latency), and an overhead of 6.8ms when tolerating two intrusions (less than 13% increase in latency). In both cases, latency remains below 100ms for all requests, meeting the timing requirements of power grid SCADA systems [10], [11].

The key contributions of this work are:
- The design of the first BFT system that leverages offsite data centers to achieve resilience to simultaneous network attacks and system compromises, without exposing confidential state or algorithms to data center servers.
- Extensions to the basic system to provide well-defined confidentiality guarantees in the case of an on-premises server compromise.
- An implementation and evaluation of the system in the context of SCADA for the power grid, demonstrating acceptable performance overhead and compliance with latency requirements.

## II. Background and Related Work

### A. BFT Basics
Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) state machine replication is a well-known technique for providing intrusion tolerance. It ensures safety (correctness and consistency of the system state) and liveness (progress in processing updates) even if up to a certain threshold of replicas are compromised (e.g., [12]). The number of tolerated compromises depends on the system's design and the number of replicas.
