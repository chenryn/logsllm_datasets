### Appendix A: Interview Script

**Introduction:**
The purpose of this study is to inform the design of an app to help users like you learn more about browsing the internet and online trackers. You are allowed to leave at any time. If you still consent to being part of this study, please say, "Yes." [Wait] Are you okay with me recording audio for our session? [Wait]

Today's study has three parts:
1. I have some introductory questions about your experiences with online tracking, and I’ll also explain what the app is supposed to do.
2. The main part, where we’ll go through each page of the app.
3. A few short closing questions.

**Initial Questions:**
- On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the least and 5 being the most, how knowledgeable would you say you are about online tracking and how it works?
- On a scale of 1 to 5, how interested would you say that you are in learning more about online tracking? Why did you choose that number?
- In your own words, could you explain to me what you know about online tracking?

**App Introduction:**
Today we are testing an app called "Tracking Transparency." It was developed by researchers at the University of Chicago, and we were hired by these researchers to get feedback about the app. The app is a browser extension that shows your browsing history, which trackers you have encountered online, and what inferences they might have made about you based on web pages you have visited.

Now, I’m going to read a short description of online tracking that the researchers want you to know: When you browse the internet, your online activity is tracked by the website you are visiting, as well as by third-party advertising and analytics companies. These third-party companies use logs of your browsing behavior to infer your interests, preferences, and demographics. They can then tailor your internet experience in part based on those inferences, impacting the search results, ads, and social feeds that you see. For example, if you visit a blog about traveling with dogs and a third-party tracker on that site infers that you are interested in dogs, later, you might encounter an ad that was targeted specifically to dog lovers.

Again, we were hired by the researchers to get feedback on their Tracking Transparency browser extension. I didn’t make the app, so please feel free to give me any and all feedback; I won’t be offended! There is not one particular design they hope you’ll like better than the others; they’re most interested in your honest and blunt feedback for everything you see. As you go through the app, I would like you to think aloud for me as you answer. You know the little voice in your head that sometimes narrates as you answer questions or take surveys? I just want you to vocalize that little voice out loud for me as you go through.

Let’s get started. We have a copy of the extension on this computer for you to use. As you can see, the browser extension logo is in the upper right corner. If we click on the extension logo, the extension provides an overview of the tracking information, and by clicking on the "Show me more..." button, we will get to the main pages of the browser extension. You can access the individual tabs at the top of the browser extension: trackers, inferences, domain, recent activity, and time. Please think aloud as you go to each of these tabs.

**Guiding Questions:**
- What are you thinking now?
- Why did you do that?
- What is this tab telling you?
- What do you think the graph is showing you?
- What do you think the table is showing you?
- What is confusing on this tab to you? (Change/add/remove to make clearer?)
- What do you think would happen if you clicked this link?
- Do you think the graph is interesting?
- Would you add/change/remove anything to make this tab more interesting?
- Would you return to this tab after the first time you see it? Why?
- What is the most interesting thing on this page to you?
- Is there anything you would want to know but isn’t explained on this tab?
- Do you feel like this tab is telling you new and interesting information, compared to previous tabs?

**Closing Questions:**
- On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the least and 5 being the most, how informative would you say the app was?
- On a scale of 1 to 5, how knowledgeable would you say you are now, after this session, about how online tracking works?
- On a scale of 1 to 5, how interested would you say that you are now, after this session, in learning more about online tracking? Why did you choose that number?

And finally, do you have any questions for us? Thank you so much for your participation in today’s session. We are very grateful for all your comments today, and will be passing them on to the researchers for their final design. Here is a $10 Amazon gift card. If you have any questions about this research, you may contact our Principal Investigator or the IRB at the contact info on the consent form. Thank you again!
