**Description:**

We are currently using the `requests` package for our application development, and our framework automatically updates to the latest version of `requests` during each build. Today, we encountered an issue where our application broke due to the new version, `requests 2.16.0`. Specifically, the "Packages" module is completely missing in this version, which has caused a critical block in our delivery process.

Could you please investigate this issue and let us know if a quick fix can be expected?

**Working Versions:**
- `requests 2.14.2`
- `requests 2.15.1`

Thank you for your assistance.
