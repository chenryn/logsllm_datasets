### Users

#### Overview

The ArcSight UBA application provides security professionals with relevant intelligence regarding the risk posture of the organization. Users interacting with the organization’s IT assets are a cornerstone of the platform. The entire purpose of information security is to detect and prevent rogue users from conducting harmful activities that may damage the well-being of the organization.

In the context of the application, "users" refers to all individuals interacting with the IT infrastructure, including employees, contractors, temporary workers, partners, vendors, suppliers, and even customers.

#### Managing Users

Before you can view and manage users, you must import user data into ArcSight UBA. For instructions on importing user data, refer to the [ArcSight UBA Administration Guide].

After importing user data, navigate to **Menu > Views > Users** to view and manage user identities. By default, the list is sorted by Employee ID in ascending order. Click a column heading to sort the list by that attribute.

#### Advanced Options

You can choose to view users by department or division by clicking the **Advanced Options** icon in the left navigation panel. Use the filter icon to type text and filter the list of departments or divisions.

#### Investigation Workbench

Click the binoculars icon to launch the Investigation Workbench for a user. For more information, see [Investigation Workbench].

#### Viewing User Details

Click an Employee ID to view user details. See [Viewing User Details] for information about what you can do from this screen.

### Performing User Searches

#### Simple User Search

To perform a simple user search, navigate to **Menu > Views > Users**. In the search bar, select a field to search from the dropdown list, enter the search criteria, and click the search icon to display the results.

#### Advanced User Search

The Advanced search option enables you to use multiple search conditions. To open the Advanced Search options, click the **icon** on the search bar. Use the dropdowns to select the following search parameters:

- **Search on**: Select User or Peer Group.
- **Search by**: Select an available attribute (e.g., location).
- **Select Condition**: Select from the dropdown (e.g., Equal To).
- **Provide Value**: Enter the value to search.
- **Select Operator**: Select from the dropdown.
- **+/-**: Add or remove search criteria.

When search results appear, click an Employee ID to view user details.

### Viewing User Details

Security administrators can view and monitor the following details for each user:

- **General Details**
- **Organizations**
- **Peer Groups**
- **Access**
- **Activities**
- **Behavior Profile**

To view the details of a user, navigate to **Menu > Views > Users**, and then click the Employee ID for the user you wish to view. By default, the General Details screen appears.

#### General Details

This screen displays the identity details for the selected user. The information displayed represents the data collected during the import process. In the lower right corner of the screen, a collapsible menu allows you to select from the following options to jump to that section of the user details:

- **General Details**
- **Contact Details**
- **Workflow Details**
- **Employment History**
- **Custom Properties**
- **Change History**

#### Peer Groups

A user may belong to one or multiple Peer Groups, typically based on HR attributes such as job code, title, and manager. The application uses peer groups to compare the user’s access and activities and determine outlier behavior or anomalies.

To add a Peer Group for a user, click **Add Peer Groups**, search for peer groups, select them, and click **Add Peer Groups**.

#### Monitor Access

The **Monitor Access** option allows you to view the accounts, access privileges, and profiles held by a user on each resource. To view details of an account, click the **Account Name**. The Account Details include:

- **General Details** about the account, including the type, risk score, criticality, and status.
- **Access Details** about the account, including the values for each attribute mapped to the account (e.g., employeeID).

#### Monitor Activities

The **Monitor Activities** option allows you to view all activities performed by a user across all resources for a selected period. Click on any data point or field to filter events, enter a custom Spotter query, or export the search results as reports. For more information, see [Spotter].

#### Behavior Profile

ArcSight UBA generates behavior profiles for users, which are comprehensive and can store up to 120 characteristics for each user. These characteristics include time slices, activity, and IP address/hostname. Behavior profiles are used to establish a baseline of behavior for a user to determine when the user conducts abnormal or outlier behavior that indicates a threat.

You can perform the following actions on this screen:

- Select a policy for which you want to view the Behavior Profile from the dropdown.
- View activity for a different account from the **Resource** dropdown.
- Select a time range to view the behavior baseline: daily, weekly, monthly, day of week, or time of day.
- Click **All Attributes** to filter the data points on which to view the baseline.
- View **Valid Clusters** on which the profiles are generated.
- View a **Summary** of the events associated with the behavior profile.

For more information about behavior profiles, see [Behavior Profiles] in the ArcSight UBA Administration Guide.

### Editing Users

Administrative users can make changes to individual users or groups of users. To maintain the integrity of user data, any changes to user information should be made in the source application (HR data source) and then imported into ArcSight UBA using a data feed. If users are updated in ArcSight UBA, and a new data feed is imported from the source application, the latest information from the source will overwrite any manual changes made in ArcSight UBA.

#### Manage Bulk Changes to Users

To manage bulk changes to users, navigate to **Menu > Views > Users**. From the Users screen, you can search for specific users using either a simple or advanced user search. To select individual users, click the checkboxes on the left side of each user you want to edit or click the top checkbox in the user edit column to select all users. When users are selected, the edit icon appears.

Click the edit icon to open the **Modify Selected Users** dialog box. In the dialog box, you can update the following items:

- **Criticality**: Change the criticality level.
- **Watchlist**: Add the users to a watchlist.
- **Whitelist**: Add the users to a whitelist. When you select this option, additional date range fields appear. Enter a **Date From** and **Date To** for the date range that the users should be added to the selected whitelist.

When you have finished modifying the selected users, click **Save**. If your system is configured to encrypt user data, you will have an option to decrypt the selected users.

#### Edit a Single User

To edit a single user, navigate to **Menu > Views > Users** and click the Employee ID for the user you want to edit. When the User Details screen appears, scroll to the bottom and click **Edit** or **Disable** to disable the user. Edit the details for the user and click **Update** or **Delete** to delete the user.

### Peers

#### Overview

A Peer Group is a grouping of users that perform similar job functions. Peer Groups can be created using any of the user attributes. You can define any number of peer groups and assign any number of users to peer groups. Peer Groups are created to manage access outliers, access logs, and activity logs of the users that belong to a particular peer group. Users are assigned to one or multiple peer groups based on their identity attributes. Each peer group contains additional sets of users with access privileges assigned to each of them. Each access privilege held by a user is compared with all the members of each Peer Group to determine the number of users that hold the same access privilege. The greater the number of users that hold the same entitlement, the lower the probability of the access privilege being an outlier. The entitlement is determined to be an outlier if it crosses a threshold. Each user within the Peer Group may have one or multiple access privileges that are outliers. The greater the number of access privileges that are outliers, the higher the overall access risk for the user.

There are three ways to create new peer groups:

- **Peer Creation Rules**: Create Peer Groups using HR attributes and assign users based on selection criteria.
- **Peer Assignment Rules**: Assigns users to the appropriate Peer Groups based on the specified criteria.

For additional information, see [Peer Groups] in the ArcSight UBA Administration Guide.

#### Managing Peers

To manage Peer Groups, navigate to **Menu > Views > Peers**. The screen displays two tabs:

- **User Peer**: View a list of peer groups for users.
- **Resource Peer**: View a list of peer groups for resources.

In the left navigation panel, you can select a **Peer Group Type** or **Peer Name** to filter the list. Use the **Advanced Options** menu to switch the left navigation panel options between **Peer Group Types** or **Peer Names**.

- **Peer Group Types**: Lists all the peer groups of the selected Peer Group Type.
- **Peer Name**: Lists all the peers within the selected peer group.

From the left navigation panel, you can type text to filter the list of **Peer Group Types** and **Peer Names**. Click the edit or delete icons to edit or delete a **Peer Group Type**.

#### Viewing Peer Groups

Click a peer group to view details about the group.

- On the **User Peer** tab, view information about user peer groups.
- On the **Resource Peer** tab, view details of the resource peers grouped by IP addresses or server names. When you click on a resource, you can view detailed information, such as general information about the resource and who is accessing those resource peers.

#### General Details

View general details about the peer group. From this screen, you can edit the peer group information and click **Update**.

#### Members

View the list of members in the peer group. You can add members or select one or multiple members to remove. Click on a member to view details about the member.

#### Editing Peers

To select peers to edit, click the checkboxes on the left side of each peer group you want to edit, or click the top checkbox in the user edit column to select all users. Click the edit icon to open the **Modify Selected Peer Groups** dialog box. In the dialog box, you can update the following items:

- **Criticality**: Change the criticality level.
- **Watchlist**: Add the peer groups to a watchlist.
- **Whitelist**: Add the peer groups to a whitelist. When you select this option, additional date range fields appear. Enter a **Date From** and **Date To** for the date range that the peer groups should be added to the selected whitelist.
