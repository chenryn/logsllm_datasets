**Title: Botconf 2016: Dridex Goes Phishing**

In January 2016, we identified a new operational strategy employed by Evil Corp, the group behind the Dridex banking Trojan. This new variant was distributed via the Andromeda botnet platform, primarily targeting users in the United Kingdom. Our analysis of the attacks associated with this new Dridex campaign revealed that the malware's operators had significantly invested in a novel attack methodology.

Instead of using traditional web injections, the updated Dridex began to employ redirection attacks. In these attacks, victims are redirected to a completely fraudulent website that mimics the appearance of their bank's official site. Notably, the fake site even presents a valid security certificate, making it difficult for users to detect the deception.
