### Service Discovery and Anycast Scalability

Anycast, a network addressing and routing methodology, is utilized in service discovery and various applications for both IPv4 and IPv6. Katabi and Wroclawski [34] proposed an architecture that allows IP anycast to scale based on the number of groups. Their approach leverages the observation that services exhibit a skewed popularity distribution, ensuring that less popular groups do not impose significant load on the routing infrastructure, thus addressing scalability issues. However, the requirement to modify routers diminishes the practicality of this approach. Additionally, as a router-based solution, it inherits many of the limitations associated with IPv4 anycast.

### Application Layer Anycast Implementations

Due to the limitations of traditional anycast approaches, modern implementations often occur at the application layer. This method provides a form of anycast service discovery, where DNS-based approaches use DNS redirection, and URL-rewriting techniques dynamically adjust URL links to redirect clients to the appropriate server. Academic proposals, such as those in [35][36], involve using an application-level name that is initially mapped to the unicast address of a group member. By relying on underlying unicast support, these methods circumvent the limitations of IP anycast. The primary challenge here is to efficiently and robustly collect selection metrics about group members.

### i3 and PIAS: Indirection Architectures

Another approach in this design space is the use of indirection architectures, such as i3 [37]. i3 uses identifiers as a layer of indirection, providing the receiver with extensive control over how it can be reached by senders. One of the services i3 can provide is anycast. Compared to i3, PIAS (Practical IP Anycast Service) offers several advantages for anycast. First, PIAS requires no changes to the protocol stack, whereas i3 necessitates the insertion of a new layer below transport. Second, PIAS, which uses native IP anycast, makes it easier to derive proximity, as it only needs to measure distances between proxies, unlike i3, which must measure distances to clients and targets.

However, i3 has the advantage of being easier to deploy, as it does not require IP anycast. The scalability of i3's anycast, as described, would not handle very large or dynamic groups, as a single node holds all targets and receives pings from them. It may be possible to improve this with a model similar to their multicast approach, but this remains uncertain.

### Broader Indirection Capabilities

While i3 is more general in terms of indirection, offering powerful chaining capabilities and an elegant security model, PIAS also provides indirection benefits beyond anycast. For unicast communications, PIAS can offer mobility, anonymity, DoS protection, and global connectivity through NATs. In an ideal world, a combination of i3 running over PIAS would be optimal. However, given the backward compatibility of PIAS, it may be the more compelling solution in practice.

### Anycast Applications

#### 6.1 Peer Discovery

PIAS opens up new possibilities for peer discovery in P2P networks, where there is no clear client-server distinction, and peers must frequently find and be found by multiple other peers. Traditional IP anycast has not been suitable for peer discovery due to the inability of group members to send packets to the group. With PIAS, random selection can help peers find arbitrary other peers, useful for unstructured P2P networks. Proximity-based selection, combined with a mechanism to exclude already-discovered peers, can ensure that a peer finds multiple nearby peers.

#### 6.2 Reaching an Overlay Network

PIAS can be used to scale overlay networks like RON [14] to thousands of members, allowing these members to exchange packets with each other and with any host on the Internet. A high-level description of this approach involves a set of 50-100 RON "infrastructure" nodes that join a large set of anycast groups. Clients discover nearby RON nodes using one of the anycast groups and establish a unicast tunnel (e.g., a VPN tunnel) with the RON node. When a client wants to connect to a remote host, it does so through its RON tunnel. The local RON assigns a transport address (TA) to the connection using NAT and forwards the packet to the remote host. The remote host returns the packet to a nearby RON node, which identifies the local RON node and tags the packet with its identity, forwarding it through the RON network to the local RON node. This process ensures subsequent packets traverse the RON network efficiently.

This technique can also be applied to route optimization in Mobile IP (for v4 or v6) or for anonymizing traffic without sacrificing performance.

### Discussion

In this paper, we have presented the basic aspects of PIAS, a practical IP anycast service. Key features, such as scoping to ensure that packets from clients within a domain are served by targets within the same domain, can be achieved by deploying a PIAS proxy in the domain or using intra-domain native IP anycast.

Security is another critical issue. While PIAS involves advertising a prefix into inter-domain routing, it does not exacerbate existing security issues. PIAS must explicitly secure its join and leave primitives, which can be achieved using standard admission control schemes, such as EAP [39].

An implicit assumption in PIAS is the proximity of the client to the IAP and the server to the JAP. This assumption is justified by the use of native IP anycast, which discovers these relations using inter-domain routing metrics. However, preliminary measurements show that native IP anycast does not always select the closest locations, as seen in the j-root server anycast deployment. For example, 40% of measured clients experienced a stretch of more than 4 when accessing the anycasted j-root server.

The ineffectiveness of anycast in selecting close-by root servers might be due to the deployment strategy, where all 13 anycasted servers for j-root are placed in POPs of different ISPs. This can lead to suboptimal routing, as illustrated in Figure 9. To achieve low-latency paths, an ISP involved in the deployment should have clusters at a decent number of POPs.

### Conclusions

We propose PIAS, a proxy-based IP anycast service that addresses the limitations of native IP anycast. The unique features of PIAS, such as scalability with group size and dynamics, open new avenues for anycast usage. Simulations on the real tier-1 topology of the Internet demonstrate the efficiency of our approach. PIAS uses native IP anycast, making it a simple and general means of discovery and bootstrapping. A PIAS prototype has been built, and deployment efforts are underway. We believe PIAS has the potential to fulfill the need for a generic, Internet-wide anycast service that can serve as a building block for various applications, both old and new.
