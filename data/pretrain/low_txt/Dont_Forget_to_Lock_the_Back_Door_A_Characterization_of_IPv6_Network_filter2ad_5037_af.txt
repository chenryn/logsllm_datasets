### Introduction

We were unaware of any data that could provide insight into the extent of real-world deployment of security filtering for IPv6. Our motivation for this work was to measure and raise awareness about the fundamental disparities in security controls between IPv6 and IPv4. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study of deployed IPv6 security policies.

### Background

The IPv6 protocol was standardized nearly two decades ago, before many of the lessons about Internet security had been learned. Additionally, IPv6 introduces numerous changes and features that go beyond merely increasing address space. As a result, issues with the design and implementation of IPv6 have become more apparent as it has undergone greater scrutiny by early adopters and researchers. For example, Ullrich et al. identified 36 known design and implementation weaknesses in IPv6 [51]. Several of these issues, such as those related to fragmentation headers and hop-by-hop headers, have been discussed for some time by practitioners and non-academic security researchers (e.g., [8]). Consequently, there have been several updates to the original IPv6 specifications in recent years (e.g., [7], [25], [27]). However, the hardware changes required to support these updated specifications in policy enforcement devices are taking time for vendors to implement and operators to deploy (e.g., [5]), leaving some networks vulnerable. A detailed study of such vulnerabilities would be an interesting area for future research. 

Our paper, however, focuses on characterizing the apparent misalignment of network security policies between IPv4 and IPv6, as measured by relatively reachable application ports. This highlights the vulnerability that IPv6 poses as a path to exploit upper-layer applications, rather than exploring weaknesses in IPv6 itself. Thus, our work is largely orthogonal to such research and standards changes.

### Previous Work

There has been significant interest in characterizing the size of the open or vulnerable IPv4 host population for various ports, with several recent studies related to large-scale IPv4 application discovery (e.g., [21], [44]). Our study seeks to measure the commonly vulnerable or high-value open applications on IPv6 versus IPv4. Recent studies (e.g., [17], [20]) and data (e.g., [29]) have shown a surge in IPv6 deployment, making security weaknesses related to the rise of IPv6 a natural concern for the network security community. Our study is the first large-scale examination of the degree to which dual-stacked hosts provide the same services across both protocols, a metric pertinent to the study of IPv6 adoption.

### Methodology

IPv6 host addressing schemes deployed in the wild were last studied at scale by Malone in 2008 [38]. Since then, there have been several orders of magnitude more IPv6 deployment, and the phasing out of EUI-64-based host identifiers by common operating systems. Malone's September 2007 traceroute data, likely dominated by routers, showed that 80-90% of host IDs used just the lower 8 bits, suggesting some improvement in the randomness of HIDs over the intervening eight years (we observed 68%). Methods for discovering IPv6 hosts via secondary information sources, such as DNS (earlier discussed by Bellovin et al. [11], then in RFC 5157 [16], and more recently in an IETF draft [28]), have been successfully applied to IPv6 client discovery in recent years (e.g., [41]). Our analysis of the host IDs used by servers and routers, in particular, showed that secondary sources were not necessary for identifying large fractions of these high-value hosts given today’s address allocation patterns. This should help dispel the myth that simple scanning on IPv6 is futile and somewhat heighten the risk associated with our main application openness findings.

### Results and Discussion

We built lists of 25,000 dual-stacked pingable routers and 520,000 dual-stacked pingable servers and tested connectivity over IPv4 and IPv6 to a set of common application ports. Our experiments showed that for both routers and servers, 26% of the hosts were more open for IPv6 than for IPv4 for at least one tested application (versus 18% and 17%, respectively, that were more open for IPv4). For routers, the average application was open for 84% more hosts via IPv6 than IPv4, including SSH, which was reachable via IPv6 for a staggering 166% more routers than over IPv4. For servers, this number was a lower but still significant 12%, which notably included SSH (5%) and Telnet (46%). The numbers were even higher for the 37% of servers that did not support HTTP (and thus were less likely to be behind load balancers or gateways). Among those 191,000 servers, 49% more servers were open for IPv6 than IPv4 on the often-attacked server message block (SMB) protocol, 112% for Telnet, and 343% for SNMP, for example. Deeper probing using traceroutes also showed that even when both protocols blocked an application, the manner in which policy is deployed (i.e., discrete firewall or host firewall) differed between IPv4 and IPv6.

Even when IPv6 was less open, there were hundreds or thousands of hosts for many applications that were only reachable via IPv6. While we can speculate that hosts which only support a service on IPv4 have yet to configure IPv6, it is more difficult to imagine plausible scenarios where a service is not intended to be available on IPv4 but is intentionally so on IPv6. This is the reason we are concerned even when, for applications where there are relatively more IPv4-reachable hosts, we still find hundreds or thousands only accessible over IPv6. While the lack of IPv6 connectivity may be an adoption problem, it is not a security problem; whereas, each of the hosts that do have a service reachable over IPv6 only, even if they are a minority of the hosts, could be exposing the system to an unexpected attack vector—a back door waiting for an IPv6-savvy attacker to come along and knock on it.

To gain more confidence in both our findings and our assumptions of policy parity intent, we contacted a sample of network operators who had applications reachable over IPv6 but not IPv4. We received responses from twelve of sixteen networks contacted. They validated that (i) our mappings between IPv4 and IPv6 generally appeared correct, (ii) indeed these applications were reachable, and (iii) the openness on IPv6 was, in fact, not intentional.

We note that the risk due to these services being reachable—where intended policy appears to be that they are not—is likely exacerbated by the lack of maturity of IPv6 tools and processes. For instance, older NetFlow version 5 systems, which are essential for aggregating, transmitting, and storing network traffic data for many network operators, do not support IPv6 (the newer Cisco NetFlow v9 and IETF standard IPFIX do), requiring both sources of flow information and sinks to be updated to have visibility into IPv6 traffic. Aside from NetFlow, anecdotal evidence suggests that some large organizations, including service providers, run various homegrown or legacy network management software that simply does not yet support IPv6.

There is growing awareness of the fundamental yet basic challenges in securely operating IPv6 networks, including address presentation differences and IPv6 address agility. In an IPv4 network, it is easy to correlate multiple logs, for example, to find events related to a specific IPv4 address. A simple Unix `grep` command was enough to scan through multiple text-based files and extract all lines relevant to a specific IPv4 address. In an IPv6 network, this is slightly more difficult because different character strings can express the same IPv6 address. Therefore, the simple Unix `grep` command cannot be used. Moreover, an IPv6 node can have multiple IPv6 addresses. To correlate IPv6-related logs, it is advised to have all logs with canonical IPv6 addresses. Then, the neighbor cache current (or historical) data set must be searched to find the data-link layer address of the IPv6 address. Finally, the current and historical neighbor cache data sets must be searched for all IPv6 addresses associated with this data-link layer address: this is the search set. The last step is to search in all log files (containing only IPv6 addresses in canonical format) for any IPv6 addresses in the search set [15].

We highlight this quote to underline that the deployment of IPv6 has implications far exceeding merely a larger address space. The complexity introduced by its many features, as well as the lack of stack robustness, process maturity, and available tooling that come from decades of deployment for IPv4, are evident both in the number of issues and standards changes seen in recent years and the breadth of deployments we were able to find with IPv6 unprotected. We call on operators and researchers to give IPv6 security a deeper look.
