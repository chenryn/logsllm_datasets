### Additional Results

This appendix presents the complete list of graphs for the results discussed in previous sections, including those illustrating the relationship between CDN demand and mobility for 20 of the top US counties based on population density and Internet penetration (§A.1), between demand and growth rate of infection for the 25 counties with the highest number of reported COVID-19 cases by April 2020 (§A.2), and between demand and incidence of COVID-19 cases before and after campus closing in college towns around the US (§A.3).

#### A.1 Demand and Mobility

Figures 6 and 7 show the correlation between human mobility (Google CMR) and CDN demand during April and May 2020. See Section 4 for a discussion of the results.

#### A.2 Demand and Infection Growth Rate

Figure 8 shows the correlation between CDN demand and infection growth rate in 25 US counties. The reader is referred to Section 5 for the discussion of key findings.

#### A.3 Demand and Infection Ratio in College Towns

Figure 9 shows the correlation between CDN demand and COVID-19 incidence. Table 5 lists the different campuses and student enrollments, their college town (county) and their population, as well as the population ratio [29]. The reader is referred to Section 6 for the discussion of key findings.
