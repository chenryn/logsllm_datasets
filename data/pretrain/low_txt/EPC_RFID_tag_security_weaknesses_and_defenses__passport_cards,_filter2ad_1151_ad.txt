# Table 7: Scaled KBA Timing Results

The scaled KBA algorithm produces a small rate of unintentional killing in the range of 130–150 cm. The exact cause is unclear, but multipath effects may introduce unpredictable phenomena into wireless environments. In well-controlled physical environments, such as an "authentication chamber" at a border crossing, it might be possible to largely eliminate the power fluctuations that cause unintentional killing. In such environments, the simple KBA algorithm might also be effective. Reducing \(N\) or disregarding failed responses to spurious PINs, with an appropriate adjustment in authentication confidence, would also be advantageous.

Another potential approach to the problem of unintentional killing is to constrain the power delivered to a tag by modifying the reader protocol. An abrupt cutting of a reader's emission during a KILL command might reliably place a tag in the low-power regime. However, such approaches would require modifications to reader firmware and/or hardware, which we reserve for future work.

In summary, our experiments show that KBA authentication is viable and can be an attractive complement or alternative to ABA for off-the-shelf EPC tags.

**Remark:** As noted, the write operation is not a mandatory feature in Gen-2 tags. Our scaled KBA algorithm only attempts authentication when the minimum power level is above 16 dBm. For tags that do not support the write operation, a variant of our simple KBA algorithm that first checks that the minimum read-power level is 16 dBm may be reasonable. Since Passport Cards are permalocked and read-only, this variant seems the most promising approach if KBA is to be integrated.

## 5. Conclusion

In this paper, we have explored the issue of cloning in Class-1 Gen-2 EPC tags, focusing on their deployment in Passport Cards and Enhanced Drivers Licenses. We have shown that radio-layer cloning is straightforward, but the implications in the operational setting of border control are more complex.

The lessons learned on cloning and anti-cloning extend beyond EDLs and Passport Cards to EPC deployments wherever cloning or counterfeiting poses a risk. For example, the pharmaceutical industry is embracing EPC for tracking and anti-counterfeiting, foreshadowing the technology's broad use as a security tool. Counterfeiting of consumer goods is a risk in nearly every industry. Thus, the facts, observations, lessons, and new defensive directions presented here are of general interest in EPC deployments.
