### 2.3.2 Data Conversion

Both systems, workflow management systems (WfMS) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, offer solutions for application integration. During the implementation of these systems, some form of data manipulation or conversion is often necessary. However, the requirements and approaches for data conversion differ between WfMS and ERP systems.

**Workflow Management Systems (WfMS):**
- **Data Infrastructure:** WfMS do not require a uniform and interoperable data infrastructure, allowing legacy database systems to be integrated with minimal changes.
- **Data Conversion:** While data conversion is not mandatory for WfMS, it can be beneficial for optimization and organizational purposes. Converting data into a more compatible format can enhance system performance and usability.

**Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems:**
- **Data Infrastructure:** ERP systems typically define a specific architecture for data storage, necessitating the replacement of legacy databases with ERP-compatible ones.
- **Data Conversion:** The conversion process in ERP systems involves standardizing, transferring, and "cleaning" existing data elements to ensure compatibility and integrity within the new system.

### 3 Application Integration

System interoperability and application integration are critical areas of concern and are often the cause of many failures. For example:
- **Gateway:** Gateway wrote off $140 million due to a failed attempt to integrate their online store with a purchased software system that did not work well with their existing systems [38].
- **Hershey Foods:** Hershey Foods installed three software application packages as part of a $112 million system, resulting in disastrous outcomes due to incompatibilities with other application programs [38].

Both WfMS and ERP systems are promoted based on their application integration capabilities. This section discusses how WfMS and ERP systems can be used independently or together to address intra- and inter-organizational application integration needs. We also explore the impact of Web Services in this context.

### 3.1 Enterprise Integration

ERP vendors aim to provide organizations with a comprehensive set of integrated applications that meet all organizational needs. However, despite the advantages of dealing with a single vendor, ERP vendors often cannot meet all needs with high-quality software. As a result, organizations may integrate different vendors' ERP components, even in key domains. For example, the US Navy uses PeopleSoft for human resources and SAP for supply chain management.

**Challenges and Solutions:**
- **Process Flow Model:** A key challenge for developers is understanding and modifying the process flow model embedded in ERP applications and parameter tables. To address this, a recent trend has been to incorporate workflow components into ERP systems.
- **Integration Strategies:**
  - **Initial Strategy:** Initially, WfMS were used as standalone tools to document and implement workflows.
  - **Current Trend:** The current trend is to make ERP systems more workflow-driven by integrating WfMS. This involves replacing the embedded flow logic in ERP applications with a WfMS, which manages the flow logic and invokes applications as needed.

**Future Directions:**
- **Two-Level Programming Model:** The adoption of a two-level programming model in WfMS (separating flow logic from function logic) enables more agile and responsive application creation and integration.
- **Middleware Functionality:** WfMS can act as middleware, orchestrating and initiating other applications such as spreadsheets, legacy systems, and ERP systems. This makes them ideal for implementing workflows involving multiple systems and applications.

**Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) and Business Process Management (BPM):**
- **Second-Generation WfMS:** EAI and BPM systems, often referred to as second-generation WfMS, provide richer integration capabilities than traditional WfMS. These systems use graphical tools to model processes, allowing for easy construction, modification, and adaptation of process models.
- **Example:** At Bose, an EAI toolset was used to link two legacy call center applications and an e-Commerce web application to an underlying database connected to an ERP system [46].

### 3.2 E-Commerce: Value/Supply Chain Integration

Interoperability is crucial in e-Commerce, especially as more companies create B2B links to manage their value chains. Heterogeneous systems from multiple companies must interoperate seamlessly for successful B2B integration.

**Challenges and Solutions:**
- **ERP Integration:** Integrating ERP systems into a supply chain is complex because ERP modules are designed to reflect specific business practices. Organizations often need to adapt to the ERP system rather than vice versa.
- **Workflow Systems:** Using a WfMS to integrate a supply chain can be simpler than using an ERP system. A WfMS can serve as a bridge between organizations, creating a workflow process that spans the supply chain topology without requiring radical changes to basic applications and data infrastructures.

**Ongoing Efforts:**
- **e-Commerce Workflows:** There are ongoing efforts to develop WfMS specifically for e-Commerce workflows. EAI/BPM tools are also used for real-time management of B2B processes. Future developments in this area will likely involve the implementation of Web Services.

### 3.3 Web Services: The Future of Application Integration

Major software and service providers are investing heavily in Web Services, promoting a new approach to information systems (IS) and IS architecture. Web Services promise to enable organizations to integrate and reuse existing software, reducing the complexity and cost of systems integration.

**Web Services Architecture:**
- **Foundational Standards:** Web Services are built on software standards and communication protocols such as XML and SOAP, allowing for easy information exchange among different programs.
- **Integration Capabilities:** Web Services provide a core architecture that allows any two web applications to communicate, offering a solution to enterprise and e-Commerce application integration.

**Role of Workflow and ERP Technology:**
- **Workflow Technology:** Workflows are identified as a computing model that enables a standard method of building Web Services applications and processes. Tools like IBMâ€™s WebSphere 5.0 include a workflow engine built around the Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS).
- **ERP Integration:** ERP vendors are moving towards workflow-enabling ERP applications to make them available as Web services. This integration will allow ERP applications to be components in component-based systems made possible by Web Services.

**Future Trends:**
- **Process-Centric Approach:** Current EAI/BPM software and future Web Services adopt a process-centric approach to integration, moving away from the data-centric approach of ERP systems.
- **Best-of-Breed Applications:** Many companies are seeking best-of-breed applications and moving away from ERP suites due to greater flexibility, deeper functionality, lower costs, and easier implementation. However, ERP systems will continue to play a role, particularly in providing a solid core infrastructure.

### 4 Implications for Research and Education

Stohr and Zhao [2] and Basu and Kumar [39] have outlined key research issues in the workflow area. While integration issues were cited as critical, the emerging role of workflow technology in EAI and Web Services, and the relationship between WfMS and ERP systems, were not extensively covered. These areas should be added to the research agenda.

**Research and Collaboration:**
- **Academic Research:** Most workflow research has been conducted in Europe and published in Computer Science literature, while ERP research has primarily taken place in the United States and appeared in IS journals.
- **Integrated Research Teams:** There is a need for integrated research teams from Computer Science and IS to address key workflow issues and challenges. The authors of this paper, including computer scientists and an IS Professor, exemplify such an integrated team.

**Key Research Areas:**
- **Technical Issues:** Technical issues have received the most focus in Computer Science.
- **Management and Organizational Issues:** ERP researchers in IS bring important expertise, relevant research models, and empirical data in these areas.
- **Market, Economic, and Social Issues:** These areas also require attention to fully understand the implications of workflow and ERP technologies in various contexts.
