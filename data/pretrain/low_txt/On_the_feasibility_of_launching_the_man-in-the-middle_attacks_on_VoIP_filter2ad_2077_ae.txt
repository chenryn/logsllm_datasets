### Strategies for VoIP Phone and Protocol Security

To enhance the security of VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) phones and protocols, we recommend the following strategies:

1. **Use SSL/TLS and SRTP:**
   - Implement SSL/TLS and SRTP to protect SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) messages and voice RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) streams whenever possible.
   - Note that the implementation of SSL/TLS or SRTP may introduce new vulnerabilities. For example, OpenSSL versions 0.98 are vulnerable to a remote heap overflow exploit, which could allow arbitrary code execution [5].
   - Our experiments show that major commercial VoIP services (e.g., Vonage, AT&T, Broadvoice) do not use SSL or SRTP for VoIP traffic between the phone and the server. It would be beneficial to investigate the reasons preventing these service providers from deploying SSL/TLS and SRTP in their VoIP services.

2. **Fuzz Testing:**
   - Conduct extensive and in-depth fuzz testing on VoIP phones before deployment. While this may not identify all exploitable vulnerabilities, it will raise the bar for attackers to find and exploit any remaining vulnerabilities.

3. **Intrusion Detection Systems:**
   - Develop lightweight VoIP intrusion detection systems (IDS) for deployment on VoIP phones. For instance, a VoIP traffic anomaly IDS should be able to detect DNS spoofing attacks by identifying unusually high volumes of DNS packets within a short period.

### Related Work

Previous research has primarily focused on threats and intrusion detection approaches for VoIP servers. Here are some notable works:

- **Reynolds et al. [19]** proposed multi-protocol protection against flooding DoS (Denial of Service) attacks on VoIP servers.
- **Wu et al. [25]** presented a cross-protocol intrusion detection architecture to detect certain DoS attacks on VoIP servers.
- **Sengar et al. [23]** suggested using interactive protocol state machines to build intrusion detection systems.
- **Dantu et al. [16]** proposed a multi-stage spam filter based on trust and reputation.

These methods, while effective for protecting VoIP servers, are less likely to be effective against attacks targeting end VoIP users.

- **Arkko et al. [12]** proposed a scheme to negotiate security mechanisms between two SIP entities.
- **Baugher et al. [13]** introduced SRTP to protect media traffic. However, SRTP is not widely adopted in deployed VoIP systems.
- **Salsano et al. [21]** evaluated the overhead of SIP processing when SIP authentication and TLS are employed.
- **Bellovin et al. [14]** analyzed the challenges in applying the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) to wiretap VoIP calls.
- **McGann and Sicker [17]** assessed the detection capabilities of several VoIP security tools, including SiVuS, PROTOS SIP Fuzzer [6], SIP Forum Test Framework, and some commercial products. They found a significant gap between known VoIP security vulnerabilities and the tools' detection capabilities.
- **Zhang et al. [26]** demonstrated that Vonage and AT&T CallVantage were vulnerable to billing attacks.
- **Wang et al. [24]** systematically studied the trust in current SIP-based VoIP and demonstrated call diversion attacks on Vonage and AT&T VoIP users, which can be used to launch voice phishing (vishing) attacks.

Several studies have explored weaknesses in DNS [3] [7]. However, to our knowledge, there is no published work on exploiting DNS weaknesses in deployed VoIP environments.

### Conclusion

While Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks on VoIP have been known for years, their feasibility in deployed VoIP systems has been underestimated. Previous MITM attacks required the adversary to be initially in the path of VoIP traffic.

The key contribution of this paper is demonstrating that an adversary does not need to be initially in the path of VoIP traffic to conduct a MITM attack. Our case study of Vonage VoIP service shows that a remote attacker can stealthily become a remote MITM and launch various MITM attacks (e.g., wiretapping, call hijacking) if they know the target's phone number and IP address. Our results highlight that:

1. The MITM attack on VoIP is more realistic than previously thought.
2. Securing all nodes along the path of VoIP traffic is insufficient to prevent MITM attacks.
3. Vulnerabilities in non-VoIP-specific protocols (e.g., DNS) can lead to the compromise of VoIP.
