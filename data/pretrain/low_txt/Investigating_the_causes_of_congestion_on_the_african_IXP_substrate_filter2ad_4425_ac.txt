### GHANATEL and GIXA: Congestion Analysis

**ISP Services and Link Capacities**
GHANATEL, the Internet Service Provider (ISP), offered transit services through a 100 Mbps link. This ISP served its clients via a main peering link of 1 Gbps. Our measurements identified the 100 Mbps transit link as the one suffering from congestion. Consequently, GHANATEL users were likely not directly impacted during the initial phase (Phase 1).

**Phase 2: Congestion and Transit Service Shutdown**
The amplitude of the waveform decreased to 10 ms from June 15, 2016, to August 6, 2016, which we term Phase 2 (Figure 2a). This period coincides with the shutdown of the transit service. The IXP operator explained that GHANATEL terminated the transit service to compel the IXP to pay for it. Subsequently, GHANATEL used this link for peering until early October, leaving the Google Global Cache (GGC) non-functional.

We observed a diurnal pattern, confirmed by an increase in loss rates during this phase (Figure 2b). Although Figure 2b shows loss rates up to 25%, our measurements indicate that the loss rate varied between 0% and 85% from July 21, 2016, to August 6, 2017. We hypothesize that during Phase 2, GHANATEL end-users may have been affected by the congested peering link. Additionally, all end-users of networks peering at GIXA might have experienced disruptions while accessing Google content, which was no longer cached at the IXP.

**Policy Changes and Impact**
In early October, GHANATEL ceased using the problematic link. The IXP then started using an intercontinental ISP as a transit provider for the GGC, with a higher capacity link of 620 Mbps. The IXP now pays for the transit services, and members are required to register to access content. This policy change led to a decrease in the number of peers connected to the content network, as noted in Section 6.1 and Table 2.

**Weekly Patterns and Sustained Congestion**
In both phases, far-end RTTs correlated with days of the week. During Phase 1, five large spikes corresponded to business days, while the rest were weekends (Figure 1). As congestion events persisted until the link shutdown, the congestion was sustained.

### GIXA–KNET: Congestion Analysis

**KNET Overview**
KNET provides high-quality video, data, and voice solutions throughout West and Central Africa [23]. Its link with GIXA was discovered by bdrmap on June 29, 2016. From August 6, 2016, RTTs to the far end showed a diurnal waveform, while those to the near end remained constant and below 1 ms (Figure 3a). This pattern was consistent until the end of our measurements, approximately 8 months later.

**Congestion Characteristics**
Route symmetry was evident throughout our measurements. The waveform characteristics revealed an average magnitude \( A_w \) of 17.5 ms, with a congestion event duration \( \Delta t_{UD} \) of 2 hours and 14 minutes after level shifts sanitization.

**Causal Relationship and Further Investigation**
Although congestion on the GIXA–KNET link began on the same day as the GIXA–GHANATEL link disappeared, further investigation showed no causal relationship. KNET does not provide transit services. On October 6, 2016, the GIXA operator stated that they did not believe the KNET port at the IXP was congested. Potential causes include:
- Overloaded KNET router at peak times, resulting in slow ICMP responses.
- Congested link with the GIXA content network.

**KNET's Response**
On May 5, 2017, KNET informed the IXP that they were not experiencing congestion and had not received any complaints from customers. The average loss rate on the link from July 21, 2016, to March 29, 2017, was low (0.1%). The observed pattern was consistent regardless of the day type, showing a decrease around midnight, an increase at different times, and a constant RTT value of around 20 ms in the afternoon. This pattern was sustained until the end of the campaign.

### QCELL–NETPAGE: Congestion Analysis

**VP4 and SIXP**
VP4 is hosted within QCELL (AS37309), a member of SIXP. In August 2014, Fanou et al. [13] found that RTTs between QCELL and NETPAGE were constant around 1.5 ms. However, from February 29, 2016, to April 28, 2016 (Phase 1, Figure 4a), RTTs across the link showed repeating diurnal patterns, indicating congestion. From April 28, 2016, to March 30, 2017 (Phase 2), the diurnal waveform disappeared, and most RTT values were below 10 ms.

**Congestion Mitigation**
During Phase 1, the demand to access the GGCs (for which QCELL provides transit) from NETPAGE was high. NETPAGE engineers noticed that high bandwidth usage by Google traffic from their users was degrading performance and causing congestion. They requested an upgrade of their link with SIXP from 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps. After the upgrade on April 28, 2016, congestion events disappeared and were not evident until the end of the measurement period (Figure 4b). We believe NETPAGE’s users may have been affected by these congestion events.

**RTTs and Losses: QCELL–NETPAGE (Figure 4)**
- **(a)** RTTs to both sides of the link in Phase 1, hinting at congestion.
- **(b)** RTTs to both sides of the link in Phase 2: the diurnal pattern disappeared, and congestion events were not seen until the end of the measurement period.

### Implications for Network/IXP Operators
- **Monitoring Content Links**: Links used to access content at IXPs are susceptible to congestion and need careful monitoring.
- **Transit Services Management**: Local IXP operators hosting content caches must ensure functional transit services. Mismanagement can lead to disputes, especially if demand increases without updating Service Level Agreements or if transit services are provided for free.

### Conclusions and Future Work
Our study detected congestion on only a small fraction (2.2%) of the monitored links. The IXP ecosystem in Africa is highly dynamic, with changing ISP presence, policies, and content provider involvement. Longitudinal measurement and monitoring are essential for understanding and managing this evolving infrastructure. The TSLP technique can detect congestion, but collaboration with stakeholders is crucial for accurate interpretation. We plan to deploy additional Ark probes and analyze TSLP data to further investigate congestion dynamics and compare results with current findings.
