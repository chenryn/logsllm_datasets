### Evaluations on the Additional Delay Added by Buddies

We constructed a network consisting of 8 server machines and 64 client machines, with the number of clients ranging from 8 to 512 (up to 8 clients per client machine). Each client has a 50-millisecond delay and an aggregate 100 Mbit/s connection to the servers. The servers, on the other hand, have a 10-millisecond delay to each other and a dedicated 100 Mbit/s connection to every other server.

To focus on the overheads incurred by Buddies, we avoided sending anonymous plaintexts across Dissent. The results, shown in Figure 8, indicate that Buddies imposes negligible overhead over Dissent—within the margin of measurement error—because the performance costs are dominated by the expensive asymmetric cryptography used for signing and verifying messages.

### Related Work

The utility of pseudonyms has been well-recognized since Chaum’s seminal paper on mix networks [8]. Pseudonymity has motivated extensive research in anonymous authentication [36] and signature schemes [24, 35]. One approach to protect distributed systems from Sybil attacks [19] is to build online pseudonyms atop "real-world" identities [22]. However, these approaches do not protect the pseudonym's owner from being traced via network monitoring. We agree with recent proposals to integrate pseudonymity into network architecture [29], although this gateway-based proposal suffers from the same "single point of failure" weakness as conventional single-hop proxies or commercial VPN services [1].

Multi-hop mix networks [15] and onion routing systems [18] address the single point of failure but remain vulnerable to many traffic analysis attacks. Pseudonymous communication is known to be highly susceptible to long-term intersection attacks [31, 42], which were later strengthened into statistical disclosure attacks [16, 37, 53]. Padding communications with dummy traffic [4, 6, 14, 23] can slow, but not stop, passive intersection attacks [37]. Additionally, padding may not even slow active attacks, where an attacker deliberately perturbs performance to trace a circuit [20, 38, 45]. Active attacks are realistic and are already widely used for Internet censorship [26, 49].

Buddies is the only architecture we are aware of that addresses both passive and active intersection attacks. It does so by "collectivizing" the anonymizer's control plane logic into a Policy Oracle component that cannot see—and thus cannot leak—sensitive information (Section 2), even when replicated for accountability (Section 4.3). This architecture ensures that Buddies' attack mitigation policies apply regardless of whether clients churn normally or are forced to slow down or go offline due to deliberate denial-of-service.

The Java Anonymous Proxy [3] incorporates an "Anonym-O-Meter" [21] to give users an indication of their current anonymity level. While this meter does not address intersection attacks, it serves as a precedent for Buddies' computation and reporting of possinymity and indinymity metrics.

Prior systems also protect anonymity within well-defined groups. Tarzan [23] organizes an overlay of mimics, where each user maintains constant cover traffic with k other mimics to mitigate traffic analysis attacks. Systems based on DC-nets [9], such as Herbivore [46] and earlier versions of Dissent [11, 13, 52], achieve provable traffic analysis resistance for unlinkable messages in a single communication round. Since every group member typically knows the online status of every other, linkable transmissions using pseudonyms can make such systems more vulnerable to intersection attacks than "amorphous" systems like Tor. Buddies addresses this risk by using linkable ring signatures to authenticate and "tag" users (Section 4.3).

Hopper and Vasserman [30] establish anonymity among sets of k members in a mix, similar to buddy sets, and explore the resistance of these k-anonymity sets to statistical disclosure attacks. Buddies builds on this approach to offer users dynamic anonymity monitoring and active controls over trade-offs between anonymity and performance. Aqua [6] uses padded, multipath onion routing to achieve efficiency and reduce vulnerability to traffic analysis. We expect Buddies to be synergistic with designs like Aqua's, by providing a stronger and more controllable notion of intersection attack resistance than currently provided by Aqua's k-sets.

### Conclusion

Buddies offers the first systematic architecture addressing long-term intersection attacks in anonymity systems by providing passive metrics of vulnerability and active control policies. While this is only a first step leaving many open questions, our trace-based simulations and working prototype suggest that Buddies may point to practical ways of further protecting anonymity-sensitive users of online forums.
