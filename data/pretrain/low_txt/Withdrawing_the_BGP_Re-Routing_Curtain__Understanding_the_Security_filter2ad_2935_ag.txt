### Live Fire Testing and Ethical Considerations

Academic researchers should not conduct live fire testing of weapons, nor should they attempt to measure the effectiveness of their tools on the live Internet without adhering to ethical standards. The goal is to determine whether an attack can withstand real-world execution. Some systems from both past and recent literature have tested their hypotheses using actual Internet routing behavior, rather than relying solely on simulations.

An example of an offensive tool that tests using real-world BGP advertisements is SICO, which can launch interception attacks with BGP communities. SICO leverages PEERING [5], as does this paper. Another example is Blink, developed by Apostolaki et al., which establishes fast connectivity using the data plane [17] and was also tested on the live Internet. SCION [66] and Named Data Networking [65], both proposed "future Internet architectures," are actively deployed on the live Internet.

### Related Measurements

In the background, we covered relevant security literature. Here, we discuss related Internet measurement research. LIFE-GUARD by Katz-Bassett et al. [22], [23] and Anwar et al.’s Interdomain Policy Exploration [1] use algorithms similar to our return path steering methodology. These works addressed steering return traffic around link failures between Amazon EC2 servers distributed among data centers. However, our algorithm explores greater depths in its breadth-first search of all possible paths from a single remote AS, rather than aggregating paths available from multiple poisoning ASes. While not directly related to our steering algorithm, work on BGP communities can influence inbound paths similarly to poisoning. Communities in the wild have been studied by Streibelt et al. [57].

### Conclusion

We have presented measurements demonstrating the limitations of leveraging BGP poisoning in the real world. Notably, we found that 77% of the evaluated ASes could be successfully maneuvered onto new, previously unreachable AS-links at some point. Among the types of AS connectivity, only highly connected ASes were strictly incompatible with BGP poisoning. When poisoning an AS, we demonstrated that for roughly 30% of the Internet, using non-standard IPv4 prefixes will maintain connectivity when no other routable prefixes are available. Beyond connectivity, we investigated default routing on the Internet and found that for 36% of ASes with only two providers, even in cases where the primary provider is poisoned, the AS being maneuvered will continue to route through the poisoned upstream AS. Finally, we established the first upper bound on the maximum AS-path length routable on the Internet via an exhaustive search, discovering that paths of up to 251 in length are accepted by 99% of the Internet when considering the customer cones of ASes advertising such paths.

Our key results, major takeaways, and security ramifications are summarized in Table I at the beginning of this paper, with additional discussion provided in the prior section. With these findings, we have validated or invalidated specific assumptions for systems such as Nyx, RAD, Waterfall, and others. For instance, the placement of decoy routers can effectively mitigate the impact of a RAD adversary, while poorly placing decoy routers in the core of the Internet leaves censors with vast territory to intercept traffic. For defense systems like Nyx, we demonstrated that, to some extent, the ability to defend against DDoS under their presented bandwidth models holds; however, the assumptions made about the amount of poisons possible overall and the specific ASes on the Internet that can be poisoned require significant changes to their described algorithms to achieve real-world viability in the range of cases our study shows.

Beyond Nyx, RAD, Waterfall, and decoy routing, the study we have presented has implications for potential avenues to better Internet model-building and other Internet simulation/emulation systems that must model the Internet’s de facto routing infrastructure. Most notably, we strongly recommend that all future work targeting the Internet for real-world deployment go beyond simulation and passive measurement. Researchers should intentionally conduct ethical, well-designed experiments that validate simulations in practice. We have shown that inferred topologies alone or passive measurements cannot be the sole validation in an era where the true behavior of the inherently human-driven Internet deviates strongly from inference. Like many other fields of science, security researchers’ proposed hypotheses for building, defending, and attacking distributed systems need to be conducted in the real world before the proposed work is disseminated into the literature and public discourse.
