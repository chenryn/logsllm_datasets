### The Future of Cybertravel: Legal Implications of the Evasion of Geolocation
**Presenter: Marketa Trimble, William S. Boyd School of Law, University of Nevada, Las Vegas**

#### Overview
This presentation will explore the legal implications of geolocation evasion, often referred to as "cybertravel." It will address the legality of actions where a user manipulates geolocation tools to appear as if they are physically located in a different place. For example, a user in the U.S. might use a service like MyExpatNetwork.co.uk to acquire a U.K. IP address and thus appear to be connected from the U.K. This talk will examine whether such practices are legal, whether the law currently addresses them, and how the law might evolve in the future.
