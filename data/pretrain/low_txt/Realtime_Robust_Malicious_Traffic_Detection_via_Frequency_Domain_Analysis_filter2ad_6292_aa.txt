## Abstract
Machine learning (ML)-based malicious traffic detection is an emerging security paradigm, particularly for zero-day attack detection, which complements existing rule-based detection. However, current ML-based methods suffer from low detection accuracy and throughput due to inefficient feature extraction. Consequently, they cannot detect attacks in real-time, especially in high-throughput networks. Additionally, these systems, like rule-based methods, are vulnerable to evasion by sophisticated attacks. To address these issues, we propose Whisper, a real-time ML-based malicious traffic detection system that leverages frequency domain features. Whisper utilizes sequential information represented in the frequency domain to achieve bounded information loss, ensuring high detection accuracy while maintaining high throughput. The robustness of Whisper against various evasion attacks stems from the difficulty in interfering with frequency domain features. Our experiments with 42 types of attacks show that Whisper outperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving up to a 18.36% improvement in AUC and two orders of magnitude higher throughput. Even under various evasion attacks, Whisper maintains around 90% detection accuracy.

## 1 Introduction
Traditional malicious traffic detection relies on preconfigured rules to analyze traffic features, aiming to protect legitimate Internet users from network attacks. While rule-based detection can achieve high accuracy and throughput in high-bandwidth networks, it is ineffective against zero-day attacks. Machine learning (ML) based detection has emerged as a promising complement to rule-based methods, capable of identifying zero-day attacks. However, existing ML-based methods suffer from low throughput and are often deployed offline, making real-time detection in high-performance networks challenging. Moreover, these methods are susceptible to evasion by injecting noise packets.

In this paper, we introduce Whisper, a real-time ML-based malicious traffic detection system that utilizes frequency domain analysis. Whisper effectively extracts and analyzes sequential information from network traffic, achieving low information loss and high throughput. The frequency domain features efficiently represent packet ordering patterns with minimal redundancy, enabling robust detection even under evasion attacks. We develop a three-step frequency domain feature extraction process, including vector encoding, Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT), and logarithmic transformation, to ensure accurate and efficient feature extraction. Additionally, we propose an automatic parameter selection module to reduce manual efforts in selecting encoding vectors, ensuring high detection accuracy.

We theoretically prove that Whisper is more efficient than packet-level and traditional flow-level detection methods. Our experimental results, using 42 types of attacks, demonstrate that Whisper achieves AUC values between 0.891 and 0.999, with a throughput of 1,310,000 PPS, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Whisper also detects various evasion attacks with a 35% improvement in AUC and maintains real-time detection with a detection latency of 0.06 seconds in high-throughput networks.

## 2 Threat Model and Design Goals

### 2.1 Threat Model
Whisper is designed as a plug-in module for middleboxes, receiving replicated traffic through port mirroring. The system does not interfere with benign traffic forwarding and assumes no prior knowledge of threats, enabling detection of zero-day attacks. We do not consider defenses against detected attacks, as existing malicious traffic defenses can be deployed to throttle the detected traffic. Whisper focuses on detecting active attacks, not passive ones like eavesdropping or intercept attacks.

### 2.2 Design Goals
Our primary goals are to develop a real-time, robust malicious traffic detection system that achieves high detection accuracy and task-agnostic detection. Specifically, Whisper aims to:
- **Robust Accurate Detection:** Detect various zero-day attacks and evade attempts by attackers who inject noise packets.
- **Real-time Detection with High Throughput:** Be deployable in high-throughput networks, such as 10 Gigabit Ethernet, with low detection latency.

## 3 Overview of Whisper
Whisper achieves high-performance detection by encoding per-packet feature sequences as vectors and extracting sequential information via frequency domain analysis. This ensures detection accuracy and robustness, even under evasion attacks. Figure 1 provides an overview of Whisper's architecture.

### High-Speed Packet Parser Module
This module extracts per-packet features, such as packet length and arrival time intervals, at high speed to ensure processing efficiency in both training and detection phases. It provides the per-packet feature sequences to the feature extraction module and the automatic parameter selection module.

### Frequency Features Extraction Module
This module extracts frequency domain features in both training and detection phases. It includes vector encoding, DFT, and logarithmic transformation to ensure accurate and efficient feature extraction.
