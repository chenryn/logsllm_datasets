### I Fight For The Users
#### Episode I: Attacks Against Top Consumer Products

**Who are we?**
- @zfasel
- @SecBarbie

**Our Credentials?**
- (null)

**Before We Begin...**
- **Conference Speaker Rule 101:** If you're naming vendors and don't want your talk pulled, even if the information is already known and the impact is low, avoid disclosing too much ahead of time.

**TL;DR:**
- **Bluetooth:** All the things!
- **Wireless Security Products:** CCTV vulnerabilities
- **Consumer Windows Install:** Common oversights
- **Q&A Session:** After the talk

**Three Topics in One Talk?**
- **Timing:** Keep each topic to around 20 minutes
- **Math:** 15+15+15 = 45 minutes total
- **Also, squirrel.**

### Bluetooth: All the Things!

**Another Bluetooth Talk?**
- **BlueHydra*:** Zero_Chaos & Granolocks
- **BLE Locks From Miles Away:** Rose & Ramsey
- **BLE GATT Proxy Tool:** Jasek
- **BLE-REPLAY & BLESUITE:** Foringer & Trabun

**What's Different Here?**
- **Rules:**
  - Never reveal the secret.
  - Never repeat a trick for the same audience.
  - Practice. Over and over.

**How Do You Wirelessly Identify Someone?**
- **Car on the Way In?**
  - ALPR
  - ETC RFID
  - Bluetooth
- **Came in by Foot?**
  - Facial Recognition
  - Voice Recognition
  - Cell Phone?
    - WiFi
    - Bluetooth
    - IMSI Catcher
    - Proximity
    - Credit Card RFID
    - Car Keys RFID
    - Work Badges
- **Not-So-Fancy Methods:**
  - Reservation Names
  - RFID Loyalty Cards
  - Credit Cards
  - Social Engineering

**Say It Isn't So!**
- **WiFi Caught On:**
  - iOS8 and Android 6.0
  - Historical SSIDs identify real MAC addresses
  - Take it as a data point, but not a trusted one

**That Leaves Us With:**
- **Came in by Foot?**
- **Cell Phone?**
- **Bluetooth**
- **Proximity**
- **Car Keys RFID**
- **The Not-So-Fancy Ways**
- **RFID Loyalty Cards**

**I’m Blue (dabadeedabad1e)**
- **Bluetooth Classic:**
  - 79+1 1MHz channels, 1600 hops/second
  - NAP + UAP and LAP make up the hop sequence
  - LAP is included in every message
  - Many personal devices now use Bluetooth Smart (except headsets/headphones).
- **BLE (Bluetooth Smart):**
  - 37+3 2MHz channels, interval/increment/channels dictated by master upon connection
  - 4-byte access address
  - 6-byte MAC address in advertising announcements

**Does Bluetooth Have Security Too?**
- **Access Address:**
  - Used once connected
  - Changes upon disconnect/reconnect
  - Long-term tracking is not reliable
  - Provides good short-term tracking as random broadcast MAC addresses, but applies to connected devices.

**GAP and GATT:**
- **Generic Access Profile (GAP)**
- **Generic Attribute Profile (GATT)**
- **Summary:** Methods for sharing info about the connection or devices.

**In Preparation for Takeoff:**
- **Why Are All These New Devices Advertising?**
- **Wait a Second...**
- **if (paired == FALSE) ble.mode(“advertise”)**

**Can We Disconnect BLE?**
- **Yes, Momentarily and Proximity Dependent:**
  - USRP b210 = 56MHz bandwidth
  - BLE = 80MHz, minus 6MHz broadcast
  - 50-75% coverage
  - Jam 2428 to 2478 MHz...
  - GNURadio + Random Noise = some success
  - Odd reliability depending on the host

**Option 2 – Spoof Disconnect:**
- **Blast LL_TERMINATE_IND Control Packet:**
  - Sniff the Access Address first and catch it on the right channel/right time
  - Some devices don’t take kindly to this and won’t reconnect well

**We’ve Talked About Tracking Before, Right?**
- **Sort Of:**
  - Focused on “it’s possible,” but not researching specific device behaviors.

**Leaves Us With Implementation Issues:**
- **Hello Amazon/Best Buy:**
  - **Pavlok:**
    - Static MAC
    - MAC in Name (Pavlok-XXXX)
    - Serial is its MAC, also available via GATT
  - **Trackr:**
    - Effectively Static MAC Address
    - Manufacturer Data in broadcast = MAC
    - Broadcasts Constantly
  - **Tile:**
    - Effectively Static MAC Address
    - “Tile Identifier” in GATT
    - Stays connected only while the app is open.
  - **Fitbit One:**
    - Randomized MAC, but effectively static after >4 months
    - Doesn’t remain connected, so it broadcasts
  - **Withings Active:**
    - MAC Randomizes
    - Advertises MAC as Manufacturer Data in Advertisement Data (ADV_IND)
  - **Pebble Steel:**
    - 2 Bytes of MAC in Manufacturer Name - “Pebble Time LE XXXX”
    - Says MAC is random, but after days was still the same even after reboots
    - Serial Number in Device Info
    - Goes to sleep every so often
    - Uses both Classic and BLE
  - **Fitbit Alta:**
    - Randomized MAC, but effectively static after >4 months and battery loss
    - Unlike the One, stays connected for notifications
  - **Garmin vivofit:**
    - Static MAC, but Bluetooth only works when in a “sync” mode.
  - **Microsoft Band 2:**
    - Dynamic MAC on reboot
    - “’s Band LE” as device name
  - **Apple Watch:**
    - Dynamic MAC
    - Maintains dynamic MAC between disconnects
    - Rotates appear time-based, but not 100% sure how often
  - **Huawei Watch:**
    - Android Wear
    - Random MAC, and doesn’t respond to BLE broadcasts
  - **iOS Devices:**
    - BLE for Safari and other apps
    - Heavily randomized, and while it announces as an i, no trackability

**So Who’s Doing It Right?**
- **Apple Watch**
- **Android Wear**
- **iOS Itself**

**Tool?**
- **This is where we were going to release a tool to track LAP / BLE Access Addresses / BLE Broadcast MACs.**
- **BlueHydra totally one-upped us, and we had no idea...**
- **Go try it out and contribute (we will be).**

**Where Do We Go From Here?**
- **We need to continue to test devices to document implementation issues regarding Bluetooth device privacy.**
- **GitHub Repository:** github.com/urbanesec/bledevices

**TL;DR:**
- **When MACs are random, look for:**
  - Lack of randomization, even if it says it is.
  - GAPs leaking serials
  - GATTs leaking serials
  - Device Names
- **You can deauth BLE devices to get some to respond to advertisement channel requests to get advertisement addresses (MACs).**
- **While the standard supports it, devices don’t.**
