### Abstract
Residential and small business users often connect to the Internet via home gateways, such as DSL and cable modems. The characteristics of these devices significantly influence the quality and performance of the Internet service. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a wide variety of behaviors exist in deployed home gateways, which forces application developers to design for the lowest common denominator. This paper experimentally analyzes several characteristics of a substantial number of different home gateways, including binding timeouts, queuing delays, throughput, and protocol support.

## 1. Introduction
Many residential and small business users connect to the Internet through "home gateways," which include customer-premises equipment (CPE) such as DSL and cable modems, WLAN access points, and even some types of Ethernet switches. Home gateways perform higher-layer operations like network address translation (NAT), network address and port translation (NAPT), traffic filtering (firewall functions), DHCP server, and DNS proxy. Many models also offer advanced features like traffic prioritization, shaping, web and email virus protection, and more.

Despite their widespread use, few standards regulate the functions and performance of home gateways. Relevant standards bodies have only recently begun to document best practices for some functions, such as protocol translation and DNS proxying. As a result, the performance and behavior of the network service experienced by applications in residential and small-business deployments depend heavily on the specific home gateway model. Different home gateways vary in many observable aspects, including NAT schemes, NAT binding timeouts, ICMP handling, traffic filtering, queuing, buffer sizes, and incomplete or buggy implementations of common functions like DNS or DHCP.

This experimental study measures and analyzes the behavior of a substantial number of home gateways, focusing on NAT binding timeouts, queuing delay, throughput, and protocol support, to characterize typical behaviors found in many home gateway models. This allows applications to understand the kinds of practices they can expect to encounter in the deployed base.

## 2. Related Work
Previous studies have focused on measuring NAT binding timeouts. For example, a study of UDP binding timeouts in a peer-to-peer network found that the majority (62%) of bindings timed out between 2 and 2.5 minutes. Other studies have examined inbound packet filtering behavior of NATs, hair-pinning, and ICMP forwarding. Techniques to systematically investigate binding timeout behavior have been highlighted, but no binding timeout results were presented.

Peer-to-peer NAT traversal for UDP and TCP has been covered, with a focus on "hole-punching" techniques. The success rates of various NAT traversal techniques for establishing direct TCP connections are not as good as those for UDP. Some traversal techniques would benefit from a better understanding of how NATs handle unusual packet sequences or ICMP packets.

Other studies have measured various aspects of TCP interactions with the network, suggesting that different TCP options do not cause significant problems, except in rare cases. Our study does not currently replicate these measurements but plans to expand in the future to confirm their results.

Several studies have evaluated the support of DNSSEC in home gateways, including testing for support of DNS over TCP, which our study also measures, but we do not currently perform exhaustive tests for DNSSEC support.

## 3. Experimental Methodology
### 3.1 Testbed Setup
The experimental testbed consists of a test server and a test client, both running Linux 2.6.26 kernels, VLAN switches, and various home gateway models listed in Table 1. All network links use 100Mb/sec Ethernet. The "WAN" uplink port of each home gateway connects to the test server through a switch on a separate VLAN. The test server runs a DHCP service that provides information about the global DNS server and leases a different private address block on each VLAN, which the home gateways use to configure their uplink "WAN" interfaces and DNS proxies.

The "LAN" port of each home gateway connects to the test client through a second switch, again on a separate VLAN. The test client runs a separate DHCP client to set up each VLAN interface with the information provided by each home gateway's DHCP server. The DHCP client is modified to configure only interface-specific routes.

The test server and test client are directly connected through a management link used to coordinate the measurements. Both run an instance of the `testrund` daemon, which sets up and performs each measurement and exports all captured data.

### 3.2 Measurement Methodology
Using the described testbed, several measurements were performed across the set of home gateways, including determining the timeout values for UDP and TCP bindings under various conditions, testing TCP throughput, and determining whether UDP- and TCP-related ICMP messages are translated correctly.

#### 3.2.1 UDP Binding Timeouts
UDP is a connectionless protocol without explicit connection setup or teardown. NATs create UDP bindings when they observe a packet exchange and remove bindings after a period of inactivity. Understanding the binding timeouts applied to UDP traffic is important, e.g., to determine the rate at which keepalives need to be sent.

We define several experiments to measure UDP binding timeouts under different conditions:
- **UDP-1**: Solitary outbound packet. Measures how long a NAT maintains a UDP binding after the client sends a single UDP packet.
- **UDP-2**: Solitary outbound packet, multiple inbound packets. Determines if inbound traffic refreshes a binding.
- **UDP-3**: Multiple outbound and inbound packets. Determines if outbound traffic refreshes a binding.
- **UDP-4**: Binding and port-pair reuse behavior. Determines if a home gateway prefers to use the original source port and waits before reusing an expired binding.
- **UDP-5**: Binding timeout variations for different services. Tests different well-known server ports.

#### 3.2.2 TCP Handling
TCP connections involve explicit creation and teardown phases. NATs can observe the teardown handshake to remove bindings immediately. However, idle TCP connections may not always allow the NAT to observe a teardown handshake. The following TCP tests are carried out using Linux 2.6.26 on both the client and server, with the congestion control algorithm set to Reno and certain TCP options disabled.

- **TCP-1**: TCP binding timeouts. Determines the existence of a static timeout for idle TCP connections.
- **TCP-2**: TCP throughput. Measures the performance of a 100 MB bulk transfer, including upload, download, and simultaneous up- and downloads.
- **TCP-3**: Queuing and processing delay. Measures the end-to-end delay by embedding timestamps into the payload of the throughput tests.
- **TCP-4**: Maximum number of TCP bindings. Measures the maximum number of TCP bindings a NAT supports.

#### 3.2.3 Other Tests
Additional tests will be described in subsequent sections.
