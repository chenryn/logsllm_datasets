### 3. Simplification of Equation (20)

When \( n_1 = n_2 = \cdots = n_g = \frac{k}{g} \), Equation (20) can be simplified as follows:
\[
D_{\text{past}} = \sum_{i=1}^{r} \binom{r}{i} \left( \frac{k}{t} \right)^i \left[ 1 - \left( 1 - \frac{k}{t} \right)^{r-i} \right] \sum_{d=0}^{r-1} \left( \frac{(d+1)w_g - i}{2} \right) \left( \frac{g - i}{2} \right)
\]
\[
= \frac{2tw_g - kr(g + 1)}{2t \left[ 1 - \left( 1 - \frac{k}{t} \right)^r \right]}
\]
\[
= \frac{tw_g}{kr}
\]

Since a signature has \( k \) signature elements, the expected distance \( C_v \) between \( s_{1,x} \) and the last received signature element is:
\[
C_v = \frac{tw_g}{r}
\]
for the special case of uniform group sizes.

### 4. Analysis of \( S \)

In Figure 4, where \( k = 2 \), if an attacker (i) captures the signature elements marked by thick frames, namely \( s_{1,1}, s_{2,2}, s_{2,3}, \) and \( s_{3,2} \), and (ii) blocks these signature elements from the recipients, then the attacker can forge a signature using any two of the elements surrounded by the red dashed contour. In reality, \( r \) captured signatures use at most \( rk \) distinct one-way chains. For small \( \frac{k}{t} \) and \( r \), it is approximately true that \( r \) captured signatures use exactly \( rk \) distinct one-way chains (as used in the approximation for (17)).

Let \( G_i \) denote the set of one-way chains corresponding to the \( i \)-th group. The value \( S \) is given by:
\[
S = \log_2 \left( \prod_{i=1}^{g-1} \frac{r n_i + (r-1)}{n_i} \cdot \prod_{j=i+1}^{g} n_j \right)
\]
which is different from Li and Cao's \( k \log_2 t \), because they consider \( H(\text{M}_\text{att}) \) instead of \( H(\text{M}_\text{att} \cup \text{c}_\text{att}) \).

### 6. Application to Wide-Area Measurement Systems

The analysis in the previous section forms the basis for comparing BiBa, TV-HORS, SCU+, and TSV+ in the context of wide-area measurement systems (WAMS). An introduction to WAMS is provided here.

A WAMS is a high-speed network of phasor measurement units (PMUs) designed to report voltage and current phasor measurements (amplitude, frequency, and phase). Real-time phasors enable tracking of the grid state, providing enhanced situational awareness. This awareness offers several advantages: improved operation planning, optimized transmission asset utilization, system stabilization, and disturbance containment. The lack of such awareness contributed to major blackouts, such as the 2003 North America and Italy blackouts [28, 30].

WAMS consists of four components:
1. **Synchronized PMUs (Synchrophasors)**: Report time-stamped phasors at 10-30 frames per second.
2. **Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs)**: Correlate time-tagged data and forward it to the Applications Data Buffer.
3. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: Facilitates data transmission.
4. **Real-Time Database and Data Archiver**: Collects and archives data for post-incident analysis and assessment.

Figure 6 shows the four-layer generic architecture of the WAMS [16]. PMUs are required to multicast phasor data to multiple consumers, including PDCs, for communication redundancy. PDCs at the same hierarchical level share data through multicast [1].

### 7. Comparing Multicast Authentication Schemes

With the application to WAMS in mind, the MA schemes BiBa, TV-HORS, SCU+, and TSV+ are evaluated in terms of the metrics \( \frac{L_\sigma}{S} \), \( \frac{C_\sigma}{S} \), and \( \frac{C_v}{S} \). The parameters of each scheme are set under the following constraints:
- **Security Level**: Each scheme must provide at least 80 bits of security.
- **Signature Length**: A signature should be at most 300 bytes.
- **Hash Length**: An 80-bit truncated SHA-384 hash is used.
- **Number of One-Way Chains**: \( t = 1024 \) for all schemes except SCU+.

By default, the parameters are configured according to Table 1 to satisfy the constraints and minimize the signature length due to the large data volume in a WAMS. For BiBa, two configurations are provided: BiBa0 (default) and BiBa1 (additional constraint \( C_\sigma \leq 10 C_v \)). For SCU+ and TSV+, no suitable parameter values satisfy the constraints for \( r \geq 3 \). Two TSV+ configurations are provided: TSV+0 (default) and TSV+1 (additional constraints \( C_\sigma \leq 10 C_v \) and \( C_v \leq 10 C_\sigma \)).

Figures 7 to 9 show the bar charts for \( \frac{L_\sigma}{S} \), \( \frac{C_\sigma}{S} \), and \( \frac{C_v}{S} \). The charts only show \( r = 1, 2 \) since not all configurations support \( r \geq 3 \). BiBa0 performs best in signature length but has poor signing efficiency. BiBa1 produces slightly longer signatures but has significantly better signing efficiency. SCU+ is efficient in signing and verification but requires longer signatures. TSV+ (both TSV+0 and TSV+1) is more efficient than TV-HORS in signature length when \( r = 1 \), but not when \( r = 2 \); moreover, TSV+ is several orders of magnitude slower in signing and verification. TSV+1 has more balanced signing and verification costs. Despite its simplicity, TV-HORS is a good performer in all categories.

### 8. Conclusion and Future Work

This work aims to find an efficient multicast authentication (MA) scheme for securing real-time multicast traffic within a WAMS. For real-time systems like the WAMS, an MA scheme is best constructed from a multiple-time signature (MTS) scheme rather than a conventional digital signature scheme [15, 31].

Instead of designing a new MTS-based MA scheme, we first identified four representative MA schemes: BiBa, TV-HORS, SCU+, and TSV+. Among these, SCU+ is an MA scheme constructed from an MTS scheme designed for secure code update [29], and TSV+ is our patched version of TSV [15], which we showed to be vulnerable. We provided rigorous mathematical analysis of these schemes, filling gaps and improving existing analyses. Our comparison shows that TV-HORS, while algorithmically simple, has the most balanced computational and communication efficiencies relative to security levels. SCU+, TSV+, and by extension SCU and TSV, do not offer clear advantages over BiBa, the oldest among the studied schemes.

As a follow-up, we aim to expand our analysis and comparison to cover more schemes. Theoretical accounting of memory costs is nontrivial and will be attempted in future work. Naming a single superior MTS or MA scheme is nontrivial, but this preliminary work serves as a first step, showing that TV-HORS has set a benchmark.
