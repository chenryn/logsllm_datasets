### Table 4: Providers with the Most Let’s Encrypt Domains on Live Websites

| Provider | Total Let's Encrypt Certificates (in Millions) | Percentage of Total |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Wix      | 4.0M                                         | 57%                 |
| Hetzner  | 2.5M                                         | 80%                 |
| Google   | 3.9%                                         | -                   |
| PDR      | 2.0M                                         | 59%                 |
| SingleHop| 2.0M                                         | 64%                 |

**Note:** The percentages represent the proportion of Let’s Encrypt certificates relative to the total number of certificates issued by each provider.

### Automatic Provisioning and Let’s Encrypt Growth

The rapid growth of Let’s Encrypt can be attributed, in part, to the automatic provisioning of its certificates by hosting and Content Delivery Network (CDN) providers. For instance, Wix, a drag-and-drop website building service, provides HTTPS for all users using Let’s Encrypt certificates [105]. As shown in Table 4, there are nearly 4 million unique active Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) with Let’s Encrypt certificates pointing to servers in the Wix Autonomous System (AS).

Unified Layer, a subsidiary of Endurance International Group (EIG), which provides public hosting through brands like Bluehost and HostGator, hosts nearly 34 million sites with Let’s Encrypt certificates, accounting for 27% of publicly accessible names found in Let’s Encrypt certificates.

However, the concentration of Let’s Encrypt certificates in just 10 ASes (accounting for half of all names) and 100 ASes (accounting for 80%) does not necessarily indicate that these providers are automatically issuing Let’s Encrypt certificates for every site. Instead, it reflects the broader centralization of the web. Many of the networks with the most Let’s Encrypt certificates are large cloud providers such as OVH, Amazon, Hetzner, and Digital Ocean, where customers provision certificates from various Certificate Authorities (CAs).

Of the top ten largest Let’s Encrypt clients by network (i.e., ASN), only three use Let’s Encrypt for over 90% of their HTTPS sites. This centralization is also observed for other CAs. After Unified Layer, the next largest provider that automatically provisions certificates for all customers is Squarespace, which accounts for under 4% of Let’s Encrypt domains. In total, the largest providers that automatically provision certificates for all customers account for only 34% of Let’s Encrypt names (Table 4).

### Web Servers and Let’s Encrypt Usage

While some web servers like Caddy automatically provision Let’s Encrypt certificates, the majority of sites are served from traditional web servers like Nginx and Apache. Let’s Encrypt usage varies significantly between different web servers (Table 5). For example, 85% of sites hosted on Nginx use Let’s Encrypt, whereas less than half of Apache and IIS sites do. Nginx is the most popular web server used to host public Let’s Encrypt-protected domains, while Caddy is the most popular server with near 100% Let’s Encrypt usage.

### User Demographics and Geographical Distribution

Let’s Encrypt usage is broadly similar to that of other CAs in terms of geographical breakdown and Top-Level Domain (TLD) distribution. However, adoption rates vary by country (Table 6). For example, while only 49% of .com domains use Let’s Encrypt, around 80% of .ru and .fr domains do.

There are several public suffixes with a disproportionate number of Let’s Encrypt certificates. For instance, 30 suffixes have more than 100,000 domains and greater than 95% Let’s Encrypt adoption. These fall into several broad categories:

- **Blog and Hosting Providers:** Several large blog providers create a unique subdomain for each blog they host. For example, there are certificates for 1.3 million subdomains of home.blog and 287,000 domains under automattic.com.
- **IoT Devices:** Some IoT manufacturers create a subdomain and certificate for each deployed IoT device. For example, there are 875,000 domains under keenetic.io, 384,000 under remotewd.com, 182,000 under freeboxos.fr, and 237,000 under myfritz.net. Over 99% of these subdomains use Let’s Encrypt.
- **TLDs:** Three TLDs have near 100% Let’s Encrypt usage: .blog (2.3 million), .jobs (165,000), and .ir (792,000). Let’s Encrypt is one of a small number of CAs that issue certificates for names in Iran’s TLD.

### Certificate Renewals

Compared to other sites, fewer sites with Let’s Encrypt certificates serve expired certificates. Only 2.2% of sites in the Alexa Top Million with Let’s Encrypt certificates currently serve expired certificates, compared to 3.9% of all HTTPS sites. Most renewals occur in the last 30 days before the validity period of a certificate expires (64%), but over a third of renewals occur in the early (19%) and middle (16%) periods of the first 30 days and 30-60 days, respectively. This indicates that organizations are able to maintain an improved security posture through automation despite shorter certificate lifespans.

### Discussion and Security Lessons

When Let’s Encrypt was launched, the two main criticisms of the Web Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) were that it was too difficult for server operators to use and that it wasn’t secure. Let’s Encrypt aimed to address the usability problem, which was seen as the more serious issue and a key factor in the low deployment of HTTPS. The data in Section 7 (and particularly in Figure 4b) suggest that this approach was successful, as Let’s Encrypt has been responsible for significant growth in HTTPS deployment.

In contrast, Let’s Encrypt’s impact on the security of the HTTPS ecosystem itself has been indirect. The security of certificates is dictated by the weakest CA, and security only improves when all CAs improve. Browser-makers and security advocates within the Web PKI community have been working to increase PKI security through tightened requirements for CAs, promotion of new security mechanisms such as Certificate Transparency, and enforcement of greater CA transparency and accountability. Let’s Encrypt has been an eager participant in these changes, setting an example of good PKI citizenship through its commitment to openness and fast, complete incident disclosure.

### Why Was Let’s Encrypt Successful?

The success of Let’s Encrypt can be attributed to its free and easy-to-use nature, combined with automation. While some previous CAs offered free tiers or some level of automation, no CA had combined these two features into a single service offering. Automation is necessary to keep per-certificate costs down, making it feasible to offer free certificates. Removing humans from the validation process also reduces the risk of misissuance due to social engineering or simple misjudgment.

Automation not only lowers the direct monetary cost of certificates but also reduces the administrative burden of managing them. Manual management, especially for large server farms, is inherently expensive and introduces the risk of configuration errors, such as failing to renew certificates, which can lead to downtime. Together with free certificates, the net impact is a significant reduction in the overall cost of serving HTTPS.

Free certificates, in turn, make automation practical. Although it is technically possible to have automation with non-free certificates, the requirement for payment makes automation less valuable. This is particularly evident for large hosting providers like Automattic and Squarespace, which have been responsible for a large fraction of Let’s Encrypt usage. These providers used Let’s Encrypt’s APIs to automatically issue certificates for a large fraction of their users, which would have been more difficult, if not impossible, without free certificates.
