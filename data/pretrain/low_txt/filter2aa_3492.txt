- **Happy Fun Exploit Time (with Demos)**
  - Live demonstrations of cloud exploitation techniques

- **Countermeasures and Proper Protection**
  - Best practices for securing cloud environments
  - Recommendations for managing and monitoring cloud assets

## Cloud Matters for Business
- **Why Cloud Matters**
  - Many businesses use cloud services, often without fully realizing their exposure
  - Traditional attack techniques may not work in cloud environments, requiring new approaches

## Case Study: SithCo
- **Background**
  - Red team hired to test SithCo's security
  - Domain admin access on a subsidiary domain
  - SithCo uses public cloud resources for web applications

- **Hacker Quest**
  - How to leverage domain admin access to gain entry into SithCo's corporate environment
  - Identifying and exploiting cloud deployments

## Staying Clean While Being Mean
- **Ethical Considerations**
  - Avoiding actions that could cause significant harm or legal issues
  - Necessity of having a lawyer to review and approve the scope of the engagement

- **Cloud Provider Requirements**
  - Pre-approval by account owners for attacks on Azure and AWS
  - Standard RoE, including limitations on DoS attacks and attempts to break isolation

## Buzzword Bingo
- **Key Terms in Cloud Computing**
  - Accessibility modifiers, public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, and various aaS models
  - CloudOS and its terminology (e.g., subscription, subscription admin, management APIs)

## Pathfinding, Recon, and Targeting
- **Identifying Cloud Deployments**
  - Using DNS records (MX, TXT, SPF) to identify cloud services
  - Discovering federation servers and OWA versions

- **Federation and Identity Management**
  - Understanding modern authentication and authorization in the cloud
  - Techniques for stealing identities via federated authentication

## Currency Exchange – What Do I Do with All These Hashes?
- **Credential Management**
  - Leveraging hashes and tokens in cloud environments
  - Tools for password spraying and credential extraction

- **DevOops**
  - Exploiting DevOps practices, such as API keys and shared secrets
  - Accessing source code and deployment configurations

## The Circle of Access
- **Access Between On-Premises and Cloud**
  - Bidirectional access and shared authentication methods
  - Evaluating the likelihood of cloud services needing on-premises resources

## Happy Fun Exploit Time
- **Live Demonstrations**
  - Showcasing cloud exploitation techniques in real-time

## Countermeasures and Proper Protection
- **Basic Security Practices**
  - Properly handling, storing, and managing credentials and secrets
  - Enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and least privilege principles

- **Securing Federation**
  - Protecting federation servers and using proxies
  - Auditing and logging federation events
  - Controlling cloud authentication via federation rules

- **Monitoring and Alerting**
  - Integrating cloud resources and data into defensive designs
  - Familiarizing with cloud provider security tools
  - Log collection and management for cloud assets
