### Structure of a Bitcoin Block

| Field | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Transactions List | Variable | A list of transactions included in the block. |
| Value | 4 bytes | Always set to `0xD9B4BEF9`. |
| Number of Bytes Following | 4 bytes | Indicates the number of bytes from this point to the end of the block. |
| Witness Data | 80 bytes | Segregated witness (SegWit) data, placed at the end of the block. |
| Additional Data | 1-9 bytes | Variable-sized additional data. |

**Table 4: Structure of a Bitcoin Block**

Each block is identified by a hash, which is generated by running the SHA256 cryptographic hash algorithm twice on the block. This hash is placed at the end of the block as specified by the Segregated Witness (SegWit) protocol. This approach inherits all the advantages of SegWit, including more compact witness data.

When a miner finds a solution nonce that, when inserted into the block header, results in a block header hash less than the target, the miner immediately transmits the candidate block to all its peers. By the consensus mechanism of Bitcoin, every node independently validates the new block before propagating it to its peers, ensuring that only valid blocks are propagated on the network.

With our modifications, each node only needs to verify one aggregate signature using the `AддV eri f y( ˆT , ˆA, z)` algorithm, as follows:

1. **Distinct Elements Check:**
   - Both `ˆT` and `ˆA` are ordered.
   - Traverse the lists `ˆT` and `ˆA` to confirm that every two adjacent elements are different and monotonically incremented.
   - If the elements are not distinct, abort and output `REJECT`. Otherwise, continue with the next step.

2. **Aggregate Signature Validation:**
   - Execute the aggregate signature validation.
   - Output `ACCEPT` if the verification is successful. Otherwise, output `REJECT`.

### Conclusion and Future Work

In this work, we present the first aggregate signature (AS) scheme from general elliptic curve groups without bilinear maps. Compared to a list of individual signatures, the storage volume of signatures reduces by about 49.8%, and the signature verification time can be reduced by about 72% with the proposed AS scheme. The security of this scheme is based on a new assumption called the non-malleable discrete logarithm (NMDL), which is proven in the generic group and random oracle model. We suggest that the NMDL assumption should be of independent interest.

We detail the application of the proposed AS scheme to Bitcoin, aiming to maximize performance and compatibility. To achieve this, we adopt a Merkle-Patricia tree-based implementation of our AS scheme. Besides inheriting the security features of Bitcoin, the AS-aided system is more compatible with segregated witness and provides better protection against transaction malleability attacks.

Although using both the generic group model and the random oracle model is common for practical cryptographic schemes, it is interesting to investigate whether practical AS schemes from general groups can be built with provable security only in the random oracle model. Note that our aggregate signature approximately halves the bandwidth or storage volume of signatures. Studying the (im)possibility of constant-size AS from general groups is an important question for future research, and we are inclined towards a theoretical impossibility result (at least for the case of black-box security reduction).
