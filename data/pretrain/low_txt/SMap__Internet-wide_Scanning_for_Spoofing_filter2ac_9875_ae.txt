## Figure 13: Spoofable Ratio According to Network Sizes
Network size is calculated from the GeoLite2-ASN database. For example, most NSP networks are large, with a CIDR/6. This aligns with our finding that among NSP networks, there was the highest number of spoofable networks.

## 6. Conclusions
Significant effort has been invested in understanding the extent of spoofability on the Internet. However, current measurement studies have limited applicability, providing results that apply to only a small subset of Internet networks.

Our work provides the first comprehensive view of ingress filtering on the Internet. We demonstrated how to improve the coverage of the Internet in ingress filtering measurements to include many more ASes that were previously not studied. Our techniques allow for covering more than 90% of the Internet ASes, compared to the best coverage so far, which covered only 7.5% of the ASes as performed by the Spoofer Project. This coverage can be further extended to include 100% of the Internet's ASes by scanning the entire IPv4 range instead of using the dataset from [2], which we used in our study.

The most significant aspect of our methodologies is that they do not require coordination with the scanned networks. SMap can measure spoofability in any TCP/IP network with standard and widely supported services, such as email and web. We integrated three techniques for testing ingress filtering into SMap: DNS-based, IPID-based, and PMTUD-based. Our experimental comparison of the effectiveness of these techniques demonstrated that the DNS-based technique has a wider applicability rate on networks that operate DNS resolvers than the other two techniques, while the detection of spoofability is more accurate with PMTUD.

We set up SMap as a public service for continuous collection and analysis of ingress filtering on the Internet at https://smap.cad.sit.fraunhofer.de.
