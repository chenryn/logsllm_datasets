### Delivering an E-Book to Your Kindle Device
There are several methods to deliver an e-book to your Kindle device:

- **When Logged into Your Amazon Account:**
  - From your browser (Chrome browser extension)
  - From your desktop (PC application)
  - From your Android device (Android application)

- **Without Authentication:**
  - Via USB cable
  - From your email (as an attachment) to your Kindle's email address

**Note:** The ability to spoof emails was fixed at the end of 2020. A verification link will now be sent to your Amazon account to ensure security.

### Phishing Campaigns and Free Online Libraries
A phishing campaign can be an effective method to distribute malicious e-books. There are numerous free online libraries available, such as:

- Kindle Store
- Project Gutenberg
- Open Library
- The Online Books Page
- The Literature Network
- Classic Reader
- Classic Bookshelf
- Chest of Books
- Fiction.us
- PublicLiterature.org
- Authorama
- Bibliomania
- International Children's Digital Library

### Uploading Malware E-Books
Malware can be embedded within e-books and uploaded to these platforms. Understanding the internal architecture of the Kindle is crucial for this process.

### Researching the Kindle Device
The official source code of the Kindle includes third-party open-source projects with minor Amazon-specific modifications. Key points include:

- **Latest Firmware:** Available for download.
- **Jailbreaking:** Possible on certain models.

#### Kindle Touch Architecture
- **Operating System:** Linux
- **Communication Framework:** D-Bus
- **Application Management:** LIPC + app registry
- **Native Applications:** Busybox
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** Used for Java applications
- **Booklets:** Various types of e-books
- **Pillow:** User interface
- **Webkit:** HTML/JavaScript rendering
- **X.org:** User interface
- **High-level Services:** User-facing features
- **Low-level Services/System:** Core system functions

### Components Responsible for Parsing E-Books
The `/usr/bin/scanner` service periodically scans `/mnt/us/documents` for new files and uses "extractor" libraries to extract metadata from e-books. These libraries include:

- **kfx:** `/usr/lib/ccat/libyjextractorE.so`
- **azw1, tpz:** `/usr/lib/ccat/libtopazE.so`
- **pdf:** `/usr/lib/ccat/libpdfE.so`
- **azw3:** `/usr/lib/ccat/libmobi8extractorE.so`
- **azw, mbp, mobi, prc:** `/usr/lib/ccat/libEBridge.so`

If the scanner does not match the file extension or encounters a parsing error, the e-book is not displayed to the user.

### Opening an E-Book
The Java framework is responsible for opening the book when clicked. Relevant JAR files include:

- `MobiReader-impl.jar`
- `YJReader-impl.jar`
- `PDFReader-impl.jar`
- `HTMLReader-impl.jar`
- `TopazReader-impl.jar`

For example, `com.amazon.ebook.booklet.pdfreader.impl.PDFModel`.

### Opening a PDF File
- **Process Flow:**
  - `PDFReader-impl.jar`
  - `nativeOpenPDFDocument`
  - `/usr/java/lib/libPDFClientJNI.so`
  - `/usr/bin/pdfreader`
  - `/usr/lib/libFoxitWrapper.so`
  - `fork`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:7667/command/openBook`
  - `openPDFDocumentFromLibrary`
  - `getCurrentPage`
  - `renderPageFromLibrary`

This process involves parsing and rendering the PDF page, converting it to an image. The Foxit PDF SDK, presented by `/usr/lib/libfpdfemb.so`, is used for this purpose.

### Fuzzing PDF Filters
Kindle devices use NXP i.MX processors (ARM). The following filters are supported:

- Predictor
- Decrypt
- Flate
- Fax
- Lzw
- AsciiHex
- RunLen
- Ascii85
- Jpeg
- Jbig2
- Jpx

### Vulnerabilities and Exploits
#### CVE-2021-30354: Integer Overflow
- **Description:** Malformed JBIG2Globals stream
- **Details:**
  - Image information region (width: 0x80, height: 1, stride: 0x10)
  - Refinement region (width: 0, height: 0x10, (0, 0x40000000))
  - Height_new = height + y = 0x40000010
  - Mem_size = (height + y) * stride = 0x100 (Integer Overflow)
  - Managed heap overflow
  - Decompress jbig2 data and XOR with the heap content
  - Writing through the XOR allows bypassing ASLR
  - Code execution in the `pdfreader` process
  - Data segments are Read/Write/Execute
  - Base address of data segments is not randomized
  - Operates with framework user rights

#### CVE-2021-30355: Improper Privilege Management
- **Description:** Patching the Application Registry
- **Details:**
  - Framework user has read/write access to `/var/local/appreg.db`
  - Link a “command” entry to our payload.sh
  - `appmgrd` service operates with root user rights
  - Framework user can send a LIPC message to start an application
  - Payload.sh logs out as root

### Demonstration: Remote Command and Control (C&C)
- **Summary:**
  - Execute malicious code hidden in an e-book (CVE-2021-30354)
  - Gain root privileges on Kindle devices (CVE-2021-30355)

### Potential Actions
- **Own the Kindle Device:**
  - Brick the device
  - Convert it to a bot
  - Attack other devices in the local network

- **Own the Amazon Account:**
  - Remove or resell e-books, taking money for yourself
