### 6.2.3 Open-World Performance

Figure 2 illustrates the True Discovery Rate (TDR) for the top 100 Alexa sites when they are subjected to an ideal adversary and defended by BuFLO, Tamaraw (with overheads of 200% and 687%), or no defense. To compute these curves, we first built an ideal closed-world classifier using the top 800 Alexa sites. The ideal attacker is based on the ambiguity sets described earlier. 

The results show that even with a more practical configuration, Tamaraw's overhead ratio is less than one-sixtieth of BuFLO's. This comparison highlights Tamaraw's efficiency in terms of overhead while maintaining a high level of security.

### Appendix: Lower Bound Proofs

#### Lemma 1
Suppose websites \( w_1, \ldots, w_n \) have sizes \( s_1 < s_2 < \ldots < s_n \). Let \( p_{ij} \) be the probability that the defense transmits \( j \) bytes when loading website \( w_i \).

1. For all \( i \), \( \sum_{j=s_i}^{s_n} p_{ij} = 1 \).
2. For all \( i \) and \( j > s_i \), if \( p_{ij} \neq 0 \), then \( p_{ij'} = 0 \) for all \( j' > j \).
3. For all \( j \), \( p_{kj} \leq p_{k+1,j} \) for \( k \in [1, i] \), where \( s_i \leq j \).

From these conditions, it follows that:
- \( \sum_{j=s_k}^{s_{k+1}-1} p_{k+1,j} = 1 \).
- \( p_{kj} \neq 0 \) implies \( p_{kj'} = \max_{i} p_{ij'} \) for all \( j' \in \{s_k, \ldots, j-1\} \).

#### Lemma 2
The linear program for computing the optimal \( p_{ij} \) values has an integral solution.

**Proof:**
Linear programs with Totally Unimodular (TU) constraint matrices and integral objective functions have integral solutions [7]. We prove that the constraint matrix \( A \) (derived from the constraints (a), (b), and (c) of the LP) is TU. To prove TU-ness of \( A \), it is sufficient to show:
- Every column contains at most 2 non-zero entries.
- Every entry is 0, 1, or -1.
- If two non-zero entries in any column of \( A \) have the same sign, then the row of each belongs in two disjoint partitions of \( A \).

Since the set of TU matrices is closed under the operation of adding a row or column with at most one non-zero entry [16], we may delete the 2n rows of \( A \) corresponding to constraint (c) and prove that the remaining constraint matrix \( A' \) satisfies the TU conditions (i) - (iii).

**Properties of \( A' \):**
- There are \( n \) rows (WLOG, rows 1 to \( n \)) induced by the constraint (a). These are such that: \( A_{i,(i-1)n}, \ldots, A_{i,in-1} = 1 \), for all \( i \in \{1, \ldots, n\} \) and 0 for all other entries. Therefore, each column of the partition \( B \) composed of these \( n \) rows contains only a single non-zero entry (i.e., +1).
- There is only 1 row (WLOG, row \( n+1 \)) induced by the constraint (b). This row has the form: \( A_{n+1,j} = 1 \), for all \( j \in \{12, \ldots, n^2\} \) and 0 for all other entries. Each column of the partition \( C \) composed of this single vector may contain only a single non-zero entry (i.e., +1).

From the above properties, it is clear that matrix \( A' \) is TU since:
- Each column contains at most 2 non-zero entries (+1).
- It can be partitioned into matrices \( B \) and \( C \) such that condition (iii) is satisfied.

Therefore, the matrices \( A' \) and \( A \) are TU, and the LP describing \( A \) has only integral optima.

In an integral solution of the linear program, all the probabilities are 0 or 1, so the solution is equivalent to a function \( f: S \to S \) satisfying:
- \( |f(S)| \leq \epsilon n \).
- \( \sum_{i=1}^n f(s_i) / \sum_{i=1}^n s_i \leq \text{BWRatio}_D(W) \).

We now show there is a similar function for any deterministic uniformly secure defense \( D \). Set \( f(s_i) = b_i \) where \( b_i \) is the number of bytes transmitted when the defense \( D \) loads website \( w_i \). Since \( D \) does not compress or truncate websites, we must have \( b_i \geq \max_{s \in f^{-1}(b_i)} s \) for all \( i \). Observe that we can assume \( b_i = \max_{s \in f^{-1}(b_i)} s \) without harming security or efficiency, so that \( f: S \to S \). Thus, \( f \) satisfies the security constraint \( \min_i |f^{-1}(s_i)| \geq 1/\epsilon \), and \( \sum_{i=1}^n f(s_i) / \sum_{i=1}^n s_i \leq \text{BWRatio}_D(W) \).

#### Lemma 3
The mapping function \( f \) corresponding to an optimal non-uniformly \( \epsilon \)-secure defense, or a deterministic uniformly \( \epsilon \)-secure defense, is monotonic.

**Proof:**
Consider any partition of \( \{s_1, \ldots, s_n\} \) into sets \( S_1, \ldots, S_k \). Let \( m_i = \max_{s \in S_i} s \). Without loss of generality, assume \( m_1 \leq m_2 \leq \cdots \leq m_k \). Now consider the monotonic allocation of traces into sets \( S_1^*, \ldots, S_k^* \) where \( |S_i^*| = |S_i| \). Let \( m_i^* = \max_{s \in S_i^*} s \). Observe that \( m_i^* \leq m_i \) for all \( i \), i.e., the new allocation has lower bandwidth.

Since the number of sets in the partition and the sizes of those sets are unchanged, this new allocation has the same uniform and non-uniform security as the original, but lower bandwidth. Hence, the optimal \( f \) must be monotonic.
