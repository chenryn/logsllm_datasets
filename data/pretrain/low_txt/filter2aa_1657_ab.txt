# Open Crypto Audit Project: A Comprehensive Overview

## Key Figures
- Moxie Marlinspike
- Trevor Perrin
- Joseph Lorenzo Hall

## Event Details
**Event:** DEF CON 22  
**Date:** August 8, 2014

## Formation and Leadership
The Open Crypto Audit Project (OCAP) was established to ensure the security and integrity of cryptographic software. The project's key officers and directors include:
- Matthew Green
- Marcia Hoffman
- Kenneth White

### First Board Meeting
The first board meeting of OCAP took place at DEF CON 22 on August 8, 2014.

### Initial Outreach
- **Organizations Contacted:** A few select organizations capable of conducting such audits.
- **Response from iSec Labs:** Highly positive.
- **Funding Support:** Open Technology Fund provided a matching grant.

## Fast Forward: iSec's Security Assessment
iSec Labs conducted a final security assessment, which revealed several issues:
- **Weak Volume Header Key Derivation:** Low KDF iteration count.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Risk of sensitive data being paged out from kernel stacks.
- **Boot Loader Decompressor Issues:** Potential vulnerabilities.
- **Use of `memset()` for Clearing Sensitive Data:** Insecure practice.
- **Overall Findings:** No evidence of backdoors or intentional flaws.

### Implications
- **Password Strength:** Critical as always.
- **Physical Access Required:** Exploiting vulnerabilities would likely require physical access to a mounted volume.
- **TrueCrypt Security Model:** Does not cover these attack vectors.
- **Compromised Machines:** Disk encryption will not help if the machine is already compromised.
- **PSA:** Major FDEs (BitLocker, DM-Crypt, FileVault) have similar vulnerabilities.

## Unexpected Developments
### TrueCrypt.org Goes Dark
- **Version 7.2 Released:** Signed with developer keys (updated certificate).
- **Read-Only Mode:** Site became read-only.
- **Archive Offline:** Source code and binaries archive taken offline.
- **Alternative Recommendations:** Not optimal.

### OCAP's Response
- **Continuing Phase II:** Formal cryptanalysis.
- **Trusted Repository:** Created for source and binaries across all platforms.
- **Phase II Organization:** Led by Thomas Ptacek and Nate Lawson.
- **Post-Audit Scenarios:** Considering various options, including financial support for a trusted fork.
- **Challenges and Questions:** Many remain unresolved.

## Secure Coding and Trust
### Cryptographic Engineering
> "From an attacker's perspective, gross and tiny errors are equally exploitable. This lesson is hard to internalize. In the real world, a loose screw in a bookshelf does not burn down your house."
— Maciej Cegowski

### Secure Coding Practices
- **Unintended Compiler Optimizations**
- **Primitive Type Transpositions**
- **Pointer Assignments vs. Array Assignments/Terminators**

### Expert Insights
- **Richard George (Former Technical Director, NSA IAD):** 
  > "Source code is interesting, but it’s a misconception that having it means you can find everything wrong. It’s useful for checking odd behavior, but manual analysis of millions of lines is impractical."

### Hypothetical Scenario
- **Visual Studio 2010 Example:** 
  - `memset()` did not work as expected.
  - `RtlSecureZeroMemory()` was more effective.

### Best Practices
- **Prefer Secure Memory/Copy Functions:** Use standard library functions.
- **Review Language/Framework Limitations:** Understand the constraints.
- **Compiler Optimization Side-Effects:** Be aware of potential issues.
- **GCC 4.4+ Pragma:** Offers function-level optimization control.
- **Learn from Others:** Leverage collective experience.

## Case Studies
### The Onion Router (TOR)
- **Key Files:** `crypto.c`, `tortls.c`, `connection_or.c`, `onion.c`, `rendclient.c`, `tor-gencert.c`

### Network Security Services (NSS)
- **Key File:** `sha512.c`

### OpenSSL
- **Key File:** `ec_mult.c`

## On Trust
### Threat Models
- **Complexity of Trust:** Understanding and managing trust in cryptographic systems is intricate.
- **Strong Crypto vs. Secure Code:** Strong cryptography does not guarantee secure code.
- **Forward Secrecy:** Does not address all security concerns.
- **Design Flaws:** Even the best designs can have vulnerabilities.

### Usable Crypto
- **Usability Challenges:** Implementing usable and secure cryptographic solutions is difficult.

## Takeaways
- **Recent Failures:** Often due to secure coding errors, not cryptographic flaws.
- **Static Analyzers:** Insufficient on their own.
- **Manual Inspection:** Also insufficient.
- **Binary Code:** Can differ unexpectedly from source code.
- **Subject Matter Experts:** Essential for comprehensive review.

### Final Thoughts
- **Volunteers and Bug Bounties:** Not enough for long-term security.
- **Secure Coding Practices:** Must be encouraged.
- **Test Harnesses:** Need to be smarter.
- **Public Code Review Model:** A workable model needs to be developed.

## Looking Forward
- **Phase I Report:** Released April 23, 2014.
- **Phase II Initiatives:**
  - Formal cryptanalysis.
  - OSX & Linux review.
  - Additional license work.
- **Partnerships:** Collaborating with the Linux Foundation Core Infrastructure Initiative.
- **Future Audits:** Including OpenSSL and possibly other projects.
