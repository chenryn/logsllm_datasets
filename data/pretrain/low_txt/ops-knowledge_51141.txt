I am attempting to enable Cloud Storage for my Google App Engine (GAE) application. According to the documentation, I need to:

- Add the service account as a project editor to the Google APIs Console project that the bucket belongs to. For more information on permissions in Cloud Storage, refer to the "Scopes and Permissions" section in the Cloud Storage documentation.

However, when I attempt to add the service account to the Team Members in the API Console, I receive the following error message:
"User *@*.gserviceaccount.com may not be added to Project '**'. Only members from domain *.com may be added."

Do you have any suggestions for resolving this issue?

It appears that your API Console project was created using a Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) account (e.g., @yourdomain.com). As a result, the project is automatically treated as a Google Workspace project, and only users from your domain can be added to it.

To resolve this, you can create a new project using a @gmail.com account, and then add all the necessary developers to that project. Once the developers are added, you can remove the @gmail.com account if desired. This will allow you to add the service account to the project without the domain restriction.
