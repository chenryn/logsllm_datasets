## About this Guide

This guide provides instructions for installing and initializing version 7.0.1 of the standalone ArcSight Logger and the ARCMC Logger. It includes details on initializing the Logger Appliance and installing the Software Logger on Linux and VMware VM. 

**Note:** Unless specified, all types of Logger are referred to as "Logger" in this document. Specific differences will be noted where applicable.

## Chapter 1: Overview

### ArcSight Logger

ArcSight Logger is a log management solution designed for high event throughput, efficient long-term storage, and rapid data analysis. An event is a time-stamped log entry, such as a syslog message from a host or a line appended to a log file. Logger receives and stores these events, supports search, retrieval, and reporting, and can forward selected events for correlation and analysis to destinations like a syslog server.

### How Logger Works

- **Event Storage:** Logger stores time-stamped log entries at high sustained-input rates. It compresses raw data but can always retrieve unmodified data for forensic purposes.
- **Data Reception:** Logger can receive data in the form of normalized CEF events from ArcSight SmartConnectors, syslog messages, and log files directly from devices.
- **Event Forwarding:** Logger can forward received events to a syslog server or ArcSight ESM.

**SmartConnectors:**
- Interface between Logger and network devices generating events.
- Collect and normalize event data into Common Event Format (CEF).
- For more information, refer to the ArcSight Common Event Format (CEF) guide.

### Key Features

- **Search and Reporting:**
  - Search for events matching specific queries.
  - Generate reports of events of interest.
  - Generate alerts when a specified number of matches occur within a given time threshold.
  - Establish dashboards displaying events that match specific queries.
- **Event Forwarding:**
  - Forward selected events to ArcSight ESM for correlation and analysis.
  - Forward events to a syslog server.

### Security, Compliance, and IT Operations

- **Applicability:** Although Logger is useful across various industries, its primary applications are in security, compliance, and IT operations.
- **Predefined Content Filters:** Logger comes with predefined content filters for commonly searched security, IT operations, and application development events.
- **Predefined Reports:** Predefined reports are available for common security and device monitoring use cases.

For a complete list of predefined content filters and reports, refer to the ArcSight documentation. Information on using predefined filters is included in the "System Filters (Predefined Filters)" section.

## Chapter 2: Deployment Planning

### Before Installing Logger

- **Storage and Retention:** Plan how you will store events and how long you need to retain them.
- **Latest Documentation:** The latest version of the documentation is available for download in PDF format from the official website. Online help is also accessible via the Logger UI.
- **Trial Licenses:** All ArcSight Loggers come with a 90-day trial license. After the evaluation period, a valid license is required to access Logger features.

### Initial Configuration

- **Installation and Initialization:** The installation process sets up an initial configuration. Additional configurations can be made to implement retention policies.
- **Storage Volume:**
  - **Software Logger:** Set to 24TB or available disk space, whichever is smaller.
  - **Appliances:** Set to the model's capacity (maximum 24TB).
  - **Expansion:** Storage volume can be expanded up to 24TB but not reduced.
  - **Caution:** Exceeding maximum capacity will cause events to fall out of storage.

### Storage Groups

- **Default Storage Group:**
  - Size: 1/2 of storage volume capacity.
  - Retention Period: 180 days.
- **Internal Event Storage Group:**
  - Size: 5 GB (Appliance Logger), 3 GB (Software Logger).
  - Retention Period: 365 days.
- **Custom Storage Groups:** Up to 48 custom storage groups can be created, each with different settings.

### Search Indexes

- **Initialization:** Logger is prepared for full-text searches, and frequently used fields are indexed during initialization.
- **Additional Fields:** Additional fields can be added to the index, but once added, they cannot be removed.

### Receivers

- **Default Receivers:**
  - UDP Receiver: Port 514/udp (Appliance Logger), 8514/udp (non-root Software Logger).
  - TCP Receiver: Port 515/tcp (Appliance Logger), 8515/tcp (non-root Software Logger).
  - SmartMessage Receiver: Port 443/tcp (Appliance Logger), 9000/tcp (non-root Software Logger).

### Firewall Rules

- **Software Logger:** Configure the firewall to open only the required ports.
- **Appliance Logger:** Firewall is pre-configured; use the provided script to update it.

## Chapter 3: Setting Up a Logger Appliance

### Racking and Configuring the Appliance

- **Rack Mounting:** Follow the rack installation instructions to securely mount the appliance.
- **IP Address Configuration:**
  - Default IP: 192.168.35.35 (subnet mask 255.255.255.0) on eno1 (ens1f0 for L7700 appliances).
  - Use the CLI to configure a new IP address.
- **Remote Access:**
  - Use Micro Focus ProLiant Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) for remote management.
  - Obtain and enter the iLO license key for L7600 models.

### Encrypting the Appliance

- **Micro Focus Secure Encryption:** Available for L7600 and L7700 Logger Appliances.
- **Encryption Process:** Follow the instructions in the Micro Focus Secure Encryption Installation and User Guide.
- **Caution:** Once encrypted, the appliance cannot be restored to its previously unencrypted state.
