## Abstract
Mobile Internet users have two primary options for connectivity: paying premium fees to use 3G or searching for open Wi-Fi access points. This study conducts an experimental evaluation of data transfer capabilities over 3G and open Wi-Fi access points while in motion. The comparison is performed at both driving and walking speeds in an urban environment using standard devices. Our results show that significant amounts of data can be transferred opportunistically without the need for constant network connection. We also find that, despite challenges in exploiting short contacts with access points, Wi-Fi performs comparably to 3G for downloads and significantly better for uploads.

## 1. Introduction
Wireless communication is a fundamental part of modern life, enabling people to stay connected to their jobs, family, and friends from anywhere with network access. The two dominant wireless technologies are Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) and third-generation cellular (3G) networks.

### 1.1 Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi operates in the unregulated ISM band and is widely used for providing wireless connectivity in homes, offices, and hotspots. It offers throughput up to 600 Mbits/s with coverage in the hundreds of meters. Wi-Fi is easy and inexpensive to deploy and is ubiquitous in urban areas. Despite security measures, many Wi-Fi access points (APs) remain open, and the growing popularity of community networks and free city-wide Wi-Fi makes opportunistic communication a realistic scenario in urban environments.

However, due to the sparse and non-coordinated deployment of APs, Wi-Fi is not an "always connected" technology. It is designed primarily for stationary or relatively stationary users and provides high data rates between locally connected clients but is limited by the link capacity between the AP and the Internet.

### 1.2 3G
3G technology has evolved to meet the growing demand for data in wireless voice networks. It provides seamless connectivity over large coverage areas with advertised data rates of 2 to 14 Mbits/s, shared among all users connected to a base station. 3G network operators charge either based on consumption or offer flat-rate monthly plans. These networks are expensive to deploy, and user performance is sensitive to the number of users in a cell due to the large coverage areas.

For data applications, persistent connectivity may not always be necessary. Instead, being connected "frequently enough" could be acceptable if applications and protocols can take advantage of short, high-bandwidth contact opportunities.

In this paper, we present the results of a side-by-side comparison of Wi-Fi and 3G. We show that, with default AP selection (strongest signal), unmodified network setup methods, and off-the-shelf equipment, opportunistic Wi-Fi performance is comparable to 3G. In a typical urban residential area, Wi-Fi throughput surpasses 3G at walking and driving speeds for uploads and is nearly equivalent for downloads.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the experimental setup and methodology. Section 3 presents the results, including comparisons of 3G vs. Wi-Fi under different conditions. Section 4 discusses related work, and Section 5 concludes the paper.

## 2. Experiment Description
The experiments involve two mobile clients and a server that is always connected to the Internet. One client uses Wi-Fi, and the other uses 3G. Experiments are conducted both on foot and in a car, following the same route. Wi-Fi and 3G tests are run simultaneously for a true side-by-side comparison. Data is streamed from the server to the clients for downloads and from the clients to the server for uploads.

### 2.1 Server Setup
The servers run Ubuntu Linux (version 8.04.1 with a 2.6.24-19-server kernel) and are publicly accessible machines on the Internet. They are virtual machines hosted on the Open Cirrus cluster at Intel Labs Pittsburgh (ILP). The dedicated Internet connection to ILP is a 45 Mbit/s fractional T3, which did not pose any restrictions. The 3G server runs the Apache web server and hosts large, randomly generated data files. The Wi-Fi server runs a simple socket program that generates and streams data. Both servers use `tcpdump` to monitor network interfaces and store data traces for offline analysis.

### 2.2 Wi-Fi Client
The Wi-Fi client is an IBM T30 laptop running Ubuntu Linux (version 8.04 with a 2.6.24-21-server kernel). The internal wireless device is an Intel 2915ABG network card with the unmodified Intel Pro/Wireless 2200/2915 Network Driver. The laptop scans for available open or community APs, selects the one with the strongest signal, and initiates the association process followed by IP acquisition via DHCP. Once connected, the client pings a known server to confirm Internet connectivity and begins data transfer. If the connection is lost, the client searches for another AP after a 5-second threshold. A USB GPS receiver captures speed, location, and time data, and `tcpdump` captures all wireless interface traffic.

### 2.3 3G Client
The 3G client is an out-of-the-box Apple iPhone 3G with a jail-broken firmware (version 2.2, 5G77) and modem baseband firmware version 02.11.07. The iPhone connects via the AT&T 3G network. The client synchronizes its clock with NTP, launches `tcpdump` to monitor the 3G interface, and then begins data transfer. For downloads, the `curl` command-line tool transfers large files, and for uploads, the `dd` command reads data from `/dev/zero` and streams it to the server using `netcat`.

### 2.4 Experiment Route
The experiments were conducted in a residential area near Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Figure 1(a) shows the map of the area with open Wi-Fi APs, and Figure 1(b) shows the experiment route, which is approximately 3.7 miles long. Walking experiments were conducted at a constant speed of 2.4 MPH, and driving experiments were conducted at speeds close to the speed limit of 25 MPH.

## 3. Results
Table 1 summarizes the results of 16 experiments conducted on different days in the afternoon and late evening.

### 3.1 3G vs. Wi-Fi Downloads
Figure 2 shows the instantaneous throughput for a representative experiment at driving speeds. The 3G device transferred around 55 MB of data over 760 seconds, while the Wi-Fi client connected opportunistically and transferred 34 MB over 223 seconds. These results demonstrate the potential of open Wi-Fi connectivity, even in real-world conditions.

Further analysis of the logs shows that most Wi-Fi connections were initiated when the client was stopped, slowing down, or accelerating after a stop, allowing more time for connection setup and data transfer.
