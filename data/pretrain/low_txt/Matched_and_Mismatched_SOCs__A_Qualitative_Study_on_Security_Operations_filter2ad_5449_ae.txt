# Root Causes of Security Incidents in Security Operations Centers (SOCs)

In our work, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the potential technical and non-technical issues within SOCs. We explored both managerial and analyst perspectives on these issues by crafting role-specific questions. Our study identified several critical issues that significantly impact the effectiveness of SOCs and the overall security posture of organizations.

## 8. Conclusion

This paper presents a detailed qualitative study of SOCs, uncovering various issues that affect their performance. We also examined the areas where managers and analysts agree and disagree, and we provided actionable advice and research opportunities to enhance SOC operations. 

We believe that our findings will encourage SOC professionals to develop a deeper understanding of each other's roles and set aside their differences. This work also paves the way for future research, bridging the gap between academic research and the practical needs of SOCs.

   - Are you permitted to automate parts of your SOC?
   - Which parts have you automated?
   - Have you ever felt the need for automation?

### B. Miscellaneous Topics and Issues

#### B.1 SOC Operations and Scope of Protection
Three of our participants, P4, P9, and P12, stated that all SOC operations are interdependent and have equal criticality. They emphasized that if any operation fails, others will also fail. However, others argued that some operations, such as monitoring, incident management, and proactive measures, are more important than others.

Regarding protection, the consensus among participants was that all entities and parts of the SOC have equal importance. When asked to name specific parts, participants mentioned the organization’s assets, the corporate network and infrastructure, endpoints on the corporate network, and end-users. One participant, P12, noted that they prioritize the most-viable products and high-risk users.

#### B.2 Low SOC Maturity
As time passes, SOCs mature and become more stable. Tools that generate too many false positives are fine-tuned, employees gain experience, and reports are polished. However, this process is slow, and it can take years for a SOC to reach a high level of maturity.

On a scale of 5, with 5 being the highest, more than half of our participants rated their SOC’s maturity level as 4 and higher. Participants P10 and P11 mentioned that they recently had a maturity assessment in which they scored fairly well. The rest of the participants who rated their maturity lower cited reasons such as the SOC being established within the last couple of years, varying maturity levels across the board, recent staff changes, and inefficient communication and collaboration between various teams.

One participant, P13, suggested better integration within other security teams, a holistic ticketing and reporting system, and smoother integration with the currently available tool-sets. These suggestions, she believed, would significantly improve the maturity of the SOC, and they are currently working on these improvements.

#### B.3 The Magic Wand that Comes to the Rescue
If provided with a magic wand, participants stated that they would:
- Increase the number of security staff.
- Ensure continuous training for employees.
- Resolve political issues between groups in their organization.
- Create a well-designed ticketing system with smooth integration with existing tool-sets.
- Assign an unlimited budget to their organization’s SOC.
- Improve the pre-testing of alerts before they roll into the SOC.
- Enhance the poor visibility of the SOC.
