3. **Ask the Suicide Question Directly**
4. **Listen While Assessing Current Threat**
5. **Implement an Appropriate Response Plan**
6. **Persuade the Person to Seek More Qualified Help**
7. **Follow Up**

### Reporting Obligations
- **Legal**: Are you a licensed professional being paid to evaluate the person's mental state?
- **Ethical**: Are you a social worker, teacher, or volunteer?
- **None**: An average person acting in good faith

### Building Rapport
#### Constructive Techniques
- Ask one question at a time.
- Give the person time to respond.
- Repeat back the person's input to confirm understanding.
- Say when you don't understand and ask for clarification.
- Ask open-ended questions.

#### Destructive Techniques
- Interrupting
- Asking questions in rapid succession
- Promising to keep secrets
- Leading the witness
- Trying to solve their problems
- Rational or philosophical arguments
- Minimizing their concerns or fears

**Active Listening is not Social Engineering!**

### Separating Feelings from States of Being
- **Example 1**:
  - "I AM so lonely [and no one will ever love me]."
  - "I FEEL lonely right now, but I could talk to a friend."
  
- **Example 2**:
  - "I AM a mess [and I could not change even if I wanted to]."
  - "I FEEL heartbroken and exhausted and furious and overwhelmed right now, but I didn't always feel this way in the past, and I won't always feel this way in the future. I can't change what happened, but I can change how I feel about it."

- **Example 3**:
  - "I am so burnt out."
  - "I feel exhausted from working all the time and going home just stresses me out more."
  - "I feel exhausted from working all the time and angry that I have to be on call 24/7 just to get an ounce of recognition from my boss, and the attitude I take home isn't making my family life any better. And this new guy at work is eyeing my stapler, that bastard."
  - "That new guy seems pretty good, and I'm terrified he's going to replace me if I can't prove to everyone that I'm on his level. But what if I try to learn the new stuff, I'll find out I'm not as fast at it as I used to be? I'm afraid to tell my family how anxious I feel, because I'm their rock and I don't want to disappoint them. I've been shutting them out, and now I feel guilty that it's gone on for so long that I can't bring it up and admit this is all my fault. I think about home when I'm at work, and work when I'm at home, and get nothing constructive done at either."

### Bringing It Up
- **Directly**: "Some of the things you said make me think you’re thinking about suicide. Am I right?"
- **Indirectly**: "Have you ever wished you just didn’t have to deal with all this anymore?"

**Avoid saying**: "You’re not thinking about doing anything stupid, are you?"

### Listen and Assess

- **Influence of Drugs/Alcohol/Medication**

- **Directly Asked About Suicidal Intent?**
- **Current Intent Exists? Recent Past?**
- **Where Intent Exists, Is There a Plan?**
- **How Detailed Is the Plan?**
- **If Means Are Decided, Is Access Easy?**

#### Suicidal Capability and Desire
- **History of Prior Attempts or Rehearsals?**
- **What’s Wrong, Why Now?**
- **Why Not Now?**
- **Who Else Is Involved?**

#### Risk Indicators
- **Desire**: Pain, hopelessness, feeling like a burden, feeling trapped, intolerable loneliness.

- **Professional Referral Details**
- **Agrees Not to Use Drugs/Alcohol?**

### Threat Assessment
| **Risk Level** | **Risk/Protective Factors** | **Suicidality** | **Action Plan & Next Steps** |
|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **High**       | Psychiatric disorders with severe symptoms, or acute precipitating event; protective factors not relevant | Potentially lethal suicide attempt or persistent ideation with strong intent or suicide rehearsal | Admission generally indicated unless a significant change reduces risk. Suicide precautions. |
| **Moderate**   | Multiple risk factors, few protective factors | Suicidal ideation with plan, but no intent or behavior | Admission may be necessary depending on risk factors. Develop crisis plan. Give emergency/crisis numbers. |
| **Low**        | Modifiable risk factors, strong protective factors | Thoughts of death, no plan, intent, or behavior | Outpatient referral, symptom reduction. Give emergency/crisis numbers. |

### Action Plan and Next Steps
- **Persuade the Person to Accept Your Help in Getting Better Help**
- **Secure a Commitment to Safety in Their Own Words**
- **Establish a Safe Space to Ride Out the Next Few Hours**
- **Establish and Implement a Follow-Up Plan**
- **Enlist Others to Keep Up Contact and Safety**
- **Hand Out Resources and Online References**
- **Find Appropriate Professional Care, Make an Appointment, Show Up**
- **Build a Crisis Plan**

### Building a Crisis Plan
- **Proactive Plan Created During a Non-Crisis Time**
- **Identify Personal Triggers and Warning Signs That a Crisis Might Be Developing**
- **Step-by-Step Personal Action Plan Designed to Prevent Escalation into Crisis Mode**

### Tactical Crisis Response
- **You!**: Talking to someone trusted who is educated about suicide intervention can save a life. If possible, talk in person. While implementing QPR, you can research alternate referral options and help get the person to a safe space.
- **911**: If you think/know an attempt is in progress, call Emergency Services immediately.
- **Current or Past Therapist**: Professionals with knowledge of the person's medical/psychological history are invaluable. Past therapists can help make quality referrals (e.g., after a move or due to insurance change). If the person won't make the call, you can.
- **Hospital/Counseling Center**: Making the physical move to a safe environment drastically lowers mortality risk.
