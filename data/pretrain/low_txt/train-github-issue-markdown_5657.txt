### Issue Description

I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

#### Context

We love Next.js! Recently, I made the decision to migrate our (nteract's) monorepo to Webpack 4, only to realize that Next.js is still using Webpack 3. I am inquiring about the timeline for migrating Next.js to Webpack 4. My primary reason for asking is to determine whether we should revert to Webpack 3 or wait for the next version of Next.js.

Our project includes several non-Next.js applications, some of which are loaded by a Python server and one by Electron. We aim to standardize our Webpack configuration across all these applications using the universal Webpack configurator plugins designed for Webpack 4. To avoid breaking our existing Next.js applications, I have kept them separate from this migration.
