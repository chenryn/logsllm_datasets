### A Few Comments on "Mind Games"

A friend at the NSA once said, "The only way you can tell the truth is through fiction." And so, I did.

"Mind Games" is a unique collection of 19 stories that explore brave new worlds and alternate realities. These narratives delve into the realms of computer hacking, deception, intelligence, puzzling anomalies, spirituality, consciousness, the paranormal, UFOs, and alien life forms—essentially, the fabric of everyday life in the 21st century. All of these stories have been previously published in literary, slipstream, and science fiction magazines and anthologies but have never before been available in a single volume—until now.

The most common response to Richard Thieme's writing and speaking is: "You made me think."

This first edition, beautifully illustrated and published by Duncan Long Publications, is available for the Kindle at [http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003MC5ETA](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003MC5ETA) and in e-pub format for the Nook. The retail price is $20 for the print version or $9.99 for the ebook.

#### Praise for "Mind Games"

- **Brian Snow, Senior Technical Director, NSA (retired):** "The depth, complexity, and texture of Richard Thieme’s thought processes break the mold."
- **Jeff Moss, Director, Black Hat (a division of TechWeb/United Business Media), and a member of the DHS HSAC:** "Thieme’s ability to communicate complex, abstract concepts and personalize them is like verbal origami."
- **Steven Pirie, *The Future Fire:*** "‘Silent Emergent, Doubly Dark’ is very imaginative writing, with a complexity that raises [the story] to the fringes of slipstream. We’re left wondering what’s real and what’s not...."
- **The Fix (UK):** "Beautiful descriptions and intriguing concepts...."
- **Bruce Schneier, security technologist and author:** "Thieme’s clarity of thinking is refreshing, and his insights are profound."
- **Robert Morris, Sr., Chief Scientist, NSA (retired):** "Buy this book!" – holding up *Islands in the Clickstream* at the Black Hat Briefings.
- **Robin Roberts, Information Security R&D, CIA (retired):** "The reader is left reeling, dizzy with insight."
- **Clint Brooks, former Senior Advisor for Homeland Security and Assistant Deputy Director, NSA:** "Richard Thieme takes us to the edge of cliffs we know are there but rarely visit. He wonderfully weaves life, mystery, and passion through digital and natural worlds with creativity and imagination. Delightful and deeply thought-provoking reading."
- **Larry Greenblatt, InterNetwork Defense:** "In his writing and speeches, Thieme has never let me down. Always informative, relevant, unpredictable, and thoroughly entertaining... one of the great thinkers of the cyber-world."

#### An Insightful Review by J.M. Arrigo, Professor

This extraordinary book of short stories draws the reader into multiple levels of reality and dimensions. The settings are mostly futuristic, often in engineered societies, but the principles of social engineering are laid bare, prompting reflection on current values, desires, and markers of progress.

One story that resonates deeply is "Incident at Wolf Cave," a subtle account of a married couple's evening out with friends. On their return home, the husband narrates witnessing UFOs over a lake. The next day, when he mentions the sighting, his wife denies it. This incident closes the door to the psychic connection between them, leading to their eventual divorce. While it is a UFO story, it also captures the universal experience of a rift forming when reality changes for one person but not another.

The form of the book, consistent with its theme, veers into another dimension of literature. Each story is preceded by a short introduction describing the author's relevant life experiences, quests, or critiques. Rather than demystifying the story, these introductions lock the reader more securely into the mystery. Artist Duncan Long provides a sort of portrait introduction for each story, where the boundary between line drawing and photograph blurs, further playing on the junctures of different realities.

Perhaps liking and disliking is not the right attitudinal axis for this book. The better question is: Are we ready for these uncomfortable mental adventures in consciousness and the nature of reality?

#### A Comment from a Good Buddy at One of the Agencies

"There he is, brain the size of a small planet, and what do they ask him? 'Should we file this under fiction or non-fiction, Richard?' You'd think they'd never considered the possibility that it's all true and all fiction, just... different dimensions of the same experience."
