# Conditional Access with Azure Data Explorer

## What is Conditional Access?

In today's security landscape, the perimeter of an organization extends beyond its network to include user and device identities. By leveraging identity-driven signals, organizations can make informed access control decisions. [Microsoft Entra Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) allows you to integrate these signals to enforce organizational policies. 

At its core, a Conditional Access policy functions like an if-then statement. For example, if a data engineer wants to access Azure Data Explorer, then they must complete multi-factor authentication (MFA). In this guide, you will learn how to set up a Conditional Access policy that enforces MFA for specific users using the Azure Data Explorer web UI. The same steps can be applied to create other policies to meet your organization's security needs.

### Prerequisites

To use this feature, you need a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license. To determine the appropriate license for your requirements, refer to [Compare available features of Microsoft Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access-management/azure-ad-pricing).

> [!NOTE]
> Conditional Access policies are only applied to Azure Data Explorer's data administration operations and do not affect resource administration operations.

> [!TIP]
> Conditional Access policies are applied at the tenant level, meaning they apply to all clusters within the tenant.

1. **Sign in to the Azure portal** as a global administrator, security administrator, or Conditional Access administrator.
