### Introduction of Custom Software on Printers and MFPs

Manufacturers have begun to introduce the capability to install custom software, often referred to as "printer apps," on their devices. The format of these applications is proprietary, and Software Development Kits (SDKs) are typically not publicly available, but rather reserved for resellers and contractors. A notable example is NSi AutoStore by Nuance Communications, which can be installed on many multifunction printers (MFPs) and automatically uploads scanned or copied documents to predefined locations.

Common software platforms for these printer apps include:
- Chai/OXP (HP)
- EIP (Xerox/Dell)
- MEAP (Canon)
- BSI (Brother)
- eSF (Lexmark)
- XOA (Samsung)
- ESA (Ricoh)
- HyPAS (Kyocera/Utax)
- bEST (Konica Minolta)
- e-Bridge (Toshiba)
- OSA (Sharp)
- sXP (Oki)

The ability to run custom code on a printer device poses a significant security threat. Despite this, most major printer and MFP manufacturers allow their devices to be extended with third-party applications. However, research on these proprietary software platforms remains limited. The only published work in this area is an early analysis of HP’s Chai platform, which demonstrated how to bypass signature verification using an alternate loader and execute arbitrary Java bytecode. It appears that HP has since removed code signing from later versions of Chai.

We developed a proof-of-concept printer malware that listens on port 9100 and uploads incoming documents to an FTP server before printing them. This malware was based on the work of Tsow, who extended the device to support load-balancing and included the required SDK files and proprietary Java libraries. With these libraries, arbitrary Java code can be compiled and executed on certain HP LaserJet models by uploading .jar files to a hidden URL: `http://printer/hp/device/this.loader`.

Installing the malware requires knowledge of the embedded web server password, which can be read out using PostScript or bypassed by restoring factory defaults.

### Beyond Printers: Other Security Concerns

#### Fax Channels
Fax messages are transmitted as audio-frequency tones and can be sent to any fax-capable device over the telephone system. This method could potentially bypass typical company protection mechanisms like TCP/IP firewalls or intrusion detection systems, allowing attackers to execute malicious commands on internal network printers or MFPs.

In the mid-1990s, Adobe introduced "PostScript fax" as a language supplement, enabling compatible devices to receive PostScript files directly via fax. This feature could be used by attackers to deploy malicious PostScript code through ordinary telephone systems. However, PostScript fax never gained widespread adoption and is now mostly obsolete, with fax messages typically transmitted as graphical images.

#### BadUSB Printer
While network support is standard, many printer devices are still connected to a single host via traditional USB A-B cables. If an attacker gains code execution on a printer or raw write access to the USB device, they may emulate a USB stick to boot from or a keyboard to inject keystrokes interpreted by the host. Such HID payload attacks from malicious USB sticks have been demonstrated in previous research. Technically, these attacks can be performed from any connected USB device, including printers. A successful attack could lead to code execution on the host itself, making "BadUSB printers" a potential threat and a future research opportunity.

### Conclusions

We presented a methodology and attack scenarios for printer devices, demonstrating that they are valuable and interesting attack targets. Even devices with up-to-date firmware can be vulnerable to simple, well-known attacks. These attacks allow an attacker to perform DoS attacks, access printing jobs, or gain entry into company networks, indicating that printer manufacturers may not take security incidents seriously or lack proper security analysis tools.

In addition to our methodology and evaluation, we proposed new methods to improve attacks using modern web techniques like Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). We also showed that printer-related issues can affect services like Google Cloud Print (GCP), though we were unable to determine a deterministic way to enforce the use of a specific PostScript interpreter in GCP. Similar services offered by Apple’s AirPrint and Epson should also be evaluated.

Our findings are also relevant to other IoT devices, especially given recent security incidents. IoT devices often lack robust security, making them easy targets for organized attackers building botnets. Future research should focus on defense and security analyses of these devices, using our methodologies and results as a foundation.
