**ATT&CK ID:** T1546.016  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Installer Packages

Adversaries may use installer packages to establish persistence and elevate privileges on a system. Installer packages are specific to the operating system and contain the necessary resources for installing applications. These packages can include scripts that execute both before and after the installation process. When these scripts run, they may inherit elevated permissions, which adversaries can exploit.

Developers commonly use these scripts to:
- Prepare the environment for installation.
- Check system requirements.
- Download and install dependencies.
- Clean up files after the installation is complete.

By embedding malicious content within these scripts, adversaries can ensure that their code is executed with elevated privileges, thereby maintaining persistence and potentially gaining higher levels of access.
