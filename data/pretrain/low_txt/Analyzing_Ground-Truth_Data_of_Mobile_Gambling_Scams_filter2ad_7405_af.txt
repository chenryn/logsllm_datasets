**Conclusion**

With the rapid growth and popularity of mobile markets, mobile gambling scams have caused significant financial damage to individuals and corporations. This paper provides the first empirical study based on ground-truth data of mobile gambling scams, consisting of 1,461 scam incident reports associated with 1,068 Android apps and 419 iOS apps provided by an anonymous authority. We reveal the social engineering techniques used by miscreants through a qualitative analysis of these mobile gambling scam incident reports, which can be used as material for scam awareness training. Additionally, we develop a suite of measurement and dedicated reverse-engineering tools to characterize both Android and iOS gambling scam apps, including their development frameworks, declared permissions, compatibility, and backend network infrastructure. Our research identifies two abused public online app generators, DCloud and APICloud, used by miscreants to create and sign scam apps. We also examine the payment channels used by mobile scam apps and estimate the revenue of the mobile gambling scam under the payment channels of cryptocurrency and Idlefish Money Mule. Our findings provide new insights into the mobile gambling scam ecosystem, helping to better defend against such activities.
