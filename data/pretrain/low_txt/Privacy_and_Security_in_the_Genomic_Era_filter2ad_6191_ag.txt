### IX.J.1 Setting

Customers submit their biological samples, typically saliva, to a genetic testing company. The sample is then used to genotype approximately one million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This genotypic data is digitized and stored on the company's servers. Various computational analyses are performed on this data, including ancestry, disease susceptibility, kinship, and partner compatibility tests. The results and raw data are made available for the user to download or view through a web browser. Some companies, such as 23andMe, also offer features that allow users to find and connect with distant relatives, such as third, fourth, or fifth cousins.

### IX.J.2 Threat Model

We consider several threat models in the context of specimen collection, digitization, and interpretation. A new threat arises when the data owner voluntarily posts their genomic data online, along with their identity and some phenotypic information, as seen on platforms like openSNP.org. We assume that the data owner makes an informed decision to share their genomic data, thus willingly compromising their own privacy. However, the major concern is the unintended leakage of private information about the data owner's blood relatives. 

Another issue is the aggregation of genomic data by users who post their data online. This aggregated data can be collected and used by companies for commercial or other purposes. It is important to note that some genome-sharing websites offer incentives, such as rewards, for users who share their phenotypic data (e.g., hair color, eye color, disease predisposition). Combining genomic and phenotypic data significantly increases the value of the data.

### IX.J.3 Solutions and Open Problems

While many existing solutions apply, recreational genomics introduces new challenges related to public sharing and data aggregation. Public awareness is crucial to help individuals make informed decisions about sharing their genomic data, thereby protecting both their own and their relatives' privacy. It is essential to communicate that misuse of publicly available data could discourage people from sharing genomic data even for legitimate research purposes. However, this is a broader policy and ethical debate that goes beyond the scope of this paper.

### Conclusion

The convergence of affordable computing and high-throughput sequencing technologies has made it increasingly easy to collect, store, and process genomic data. Genomic data is now being integrated into a wide range of applications, from healthcare and forensics to consumer products. However, privacy and security issues have not yet been fully defined and addressed. For example, significant computational power is required to analyze genomic data for research, making cloud computing a likely solution. Additionally, genomic data will be used in specific applications, such as forensics, where mobile devices will be commonly used to access the data. Furthermore, genomic data is becoming more accessible on the web, particularly in citizen-contributed environments like online social networks.

While some individuals are willing to share their genomic information, there are significant privacy concerns regarding what this information can reveal and how it will be used in the future. Therefore, there is a clear need to support personalized medicine, genomic research, forensic investigations, and recreational genomics while respecting privacy. Computing is a critical enabler but can also be a source of data leakage if appropriate measures are not implemented. Our survey provides insights into the most important aspects of the problem to study. We have also reviewed the state-of-the-art computational protection methods and highlighted the main challenges moving forward. To assist the data privacy and security community in developing meaningful solutions, we have provided a framework for understanding the privacy-preserving handling of genomic data.
