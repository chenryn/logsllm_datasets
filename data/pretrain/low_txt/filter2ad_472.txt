## Abstract
The 16th Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society (WPES 2017) was held on October 30, 2017, in conjunction with the 24th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2017) in Dallas, Texas, USA. The primary objective of WPES is to convene a diverse group of privacy researchers and practitioners to address privacy challenges in global, interconnected societies and to explore potential solutions. The workshop program featured 14 full papers and 5 short papers, selected from a total of 56 submissions. Topics covered included de-anonymization, fingerprinting and profiling, location privacy, and private memory systems.

## 1. Introduction
The increasing power and interconnectivity of modern computer systems have enabled the storage and processing of vast amounts of data, making networked information accessible anytime and anywhere. This has facilitated the collection, exchange, access, processing, and linking of information. Consequently, there has been a growing awareness of privacy issues, which have become the subject of public debates. The need for privacy-aware policies, regulations, and techniques has been widely recognized.

The goal of this workshop is to discuss privacy problems in global, interconnected societies and to explore potential solutions. We invite submissions from academia and industry that present novel research on all theoretical and practical aspects of electronic privacy, as well as experimental studies of fielded systems. Contributions from other communities, such as law and business, are also encouraged to provide their perspectives on technological issues. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Anonymization and transparency
- Crowdsourcing for privacy and security
- Data correlation and leakage attacks
- Data security and privacy
- Data and computation integrity in emerging scenarios
- Electronic communication privacy
- Economics of privacy
- Information dissemination control
- Models, languages, and techniques for big data protection
- Personally identifiable information
- Privacy-access control
- Privacy and anonymity on the web
- Privacy in biometric systems
- Privacy in cloud and grid systems
- Privacy and confidentiality management
- Privacy and data mining
- Privacy in the Internet of Things
- Privacy in digital business
- Privacy in electronic records
- Privacy-enhancing technologies
- Privacy and human rights
- Privacy in health care and public administration
