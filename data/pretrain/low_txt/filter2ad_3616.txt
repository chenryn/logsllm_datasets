This workshop addresses the security and privacy issues that have emerged as our society has become more interconnected, particularly with respect to multimedia data generated in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Web 2.0/3.0. The term "multimedia" now encompasses a broader range of data types, including pictures, videos, audio, and computer graphics. With the rise of social media and online peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing services, vast amounts of multimedia data are being created and shared constantly.

When this data is stored in a networked environment, it becomes accessible to many users for viewing, sharing, commenting, and storing. Specifically, multimedia data in IoT networks plays a significant role, as it can reveal people's status, locations, and live actions in real-time. This opens up numerous possibilities for attacks, as more individuals broadcast their lives and allow their networks to view and share their activities.

The increase in criminal activities in this space, such as online fraud, cyber piracy, unauthorized access, malware, denial of service, phishing, social engineering, and identity theft, often involves multimedia data and devices. These activities present new technical challenges in areas such as access control, user and device authentication, data leakage protection, privacy-enhancing technologies, identity management, digital watermarking, digital rights management, and digital forensics. Other challenges include large-scale attacks, the strength of security protection (e.g., common encryption algorithms), hiding malware within multimedia data, and location-based privacy with high accuracy and anonymity.

**Workshop Overview:**

The 2nd International Workshop on Multimedia Privacy and Security (MPS 2018), held as part of CCS 2018, focuses on these concerns. We solicited manuscript submissions on new and innovative research into methods, techniques, and proofs-of-concept supported by strong theories, algorithms, simulations, and experimentation. We received 18 valid submissions from Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and North America. After a rigorous review process, 6 full papers and 7 short papers were accepted, detailing ongoing research. The keynote address was given by Prof. Konrad Rieck of Technische Universität Braunschweig, Germany, on the topic "Family Reunion: Adversarial Machine Learning meets Digital Watermarking."
