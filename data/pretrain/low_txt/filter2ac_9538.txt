**Title: Black Hat US-20: Web Cache Entanglement: Novel Pathways to Poisoning**

Caches are integral to the functioning of websites across the internet, quietly managing data between users. However, they are often overlooked in security assessments. In this session, I will demonstrate how to remotely probe the inner workings of caches to uncover subtle inconsistencies and leverage these findings to construct sophisticated exploit chains. These vulnerabilities span all layers of caching, from extensive Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and caching web servers to internal template caches at the fragment level.

I will illustrate how flawed transformations, naive normalization, and overly optimistic assumptions can be exploited to perform a range of attacks. Examples include persistently poisoning every page on an online newspaper, compromising the administration interface of an internal Department of Defense (DoD) intelligence website, and globally disabling Firefox updates.

Building on my 2018 presentation, "Practical Web Cache Poisoning," which focused on a design flaw in the caching concept, this session will delve into implementation flaws. This deeper dive will reveal some of the most complex and hard-to-find attack techniques, making the session both challenging and highly practical.

Attendees will leave with a comprehensive methodology and open-source tools to confidently address these technical challenges.
