### 8.2 Players with Hybrid Peering Strategies

Figure 7 (lower left) clearly shows that some members only engage in bilateral peering at either the L-IXP or M-IXP. Another large group of members advertise all prefixes for which they receive traffic via the Route Server (RS), but still receive varying amounts of traffic via bilateral (BL) peerings. The most intriguing cases, however, are those members that occupy the small middle section in Figure 7 (e.g., around x = 100). These members advertise some prefixes via the RS but receive traffic for a superset of these prefixes. Although this fraction of members is relatively small compared to the overall number, it includes some significant players carrying substantial traffic volumes.

We selected two such cases: CDN, a mid-sized content delivery network, and NSP, a large transit provider. Typically, content providers openly advertise their prefixes, while large transit providers do so more selectively. However, CDN and NSP follow a "hybrid" peering strategy by advertising some prefixes multilaterally and others bilaterally to selected member ASes.

In the case of CDN, we found that nearly 90% of its incoming traffic is covered by a small number of openly advertised RS prefixes. However, this AS also has 59 BL peering links, and on most of them, we see traffic to a superset of the prefixes advertised via the RS. We assume this is an example of complex traffic engineering performed by modern CDNs, involving both the extensive connectivity provided by the RS and the application of more fine-granular prefix advertisements for specific networks, e.g., to meet performance requirements for certain customers.

NSP, on the other hand, openly advertises about 5,000 prefixes via the RS, and most of these contain subsequent ASNs in the AS path that are not other ASNs of the NSP. Nevertheless, most traffic is exchanged via BL peering sessions, and only about 20% of NSP’s incoming traffic is covered by its RS prefixes. At the L-IXP, NSP receives traffic from most member ASes, many of whom peer bilaterally with NSP and send traffic to a large superset of the prefixes advertised via the RS. Interestingly, a similar pattern is observed at the M-IXP, where NSP receives about 45% of its traffic for prefixes advertised via the RS, and the rest for a superset. We validated the advertisement of a superset of prefixes using Looking Glasses (LGes) of IXP members having BL sessions with NSP. We assume that NSP’s hybrid approach to peering supports its main business (e.g., as a transit provider) and indicates growing diversification in the transit business (see, e.g., [35], [23]).

NSP is present at many IXPs and thus may have more confidence and experience in leveraging RS functionality tailored to its business interests than other transit providers.

### Summary

Among the networks that have an open peering policy and utilize IXP RSes, we observe a diverse set of players ranging from content providers to eyeball networks. While many networks that use the RS also rely on additional BL peerings, some only use the RS (i.e., no BL peerings), and others (particularly larger transit networks) typically do not use RSes at all. We also observe networks with hybrid peering strategies, where they advertise parts of their routes via the RS and others via BL peerings, hinting at advanced usage of RSes.

### 9. Discussion

Our empirical study of real-world IXP RS deployments and how IXP RSes are used by a wide range of today’s Internet players has implications for IXP and network operators as well as researchers.

#### 9.1 On the Benefits of Connecting to an IXP

The success of large European IXPs exemplifies a positive network effect. As these IXPs grow, their value for each member increases, but managing and maintaining the resulting bilateral peerings (i.e., a large number of BGP sessions) becomes a burden for many members. To alleviate this, these IXPs offer free use of their route servers, making them even more attractive to new networks.

To quantify this attractiveness, our empirical results suggest a concrete step that IXPs and network operators could take to evaluate the immediate benefits of connecting to an IXP. At our two IXPs, where a majority of members connect to the RS (over 80% at L-IXP and over 90% at M-IXP), the prefixes advertised by the RS cover 80-95% of all traffic and include many popular destinations. Thus, if IXPs provide the profile of routes advertised via their RSes (e.g., via adequately supported LGes), network operators can immediately determine how much of their traffic would reach these destinations from day one. They can then compare different interconnection options in terms of costs, performance, or other criteria to make informed decisions.

Although we lack comparable data from other large European IXPs, the fact that a majority of their members connect to the RS (e.g., 70% at LINX, over 80% at AMS-IX) suggests that their RSes cover a similarly large portion of traffic. However, we caution against generalizing our observations across all IXPs worldwide. For example, even in Europe, there are large regional IXPs (e.g., NL-IX) where member participation at the RS is less than 50%. In North America, while many larger IXPs operate a RS (e.g., Equinix, Any2), little is known about member participation and the portion of traffic covered by the RS.

#### 9.2 A Peering Ecosystem in Flux

Our findings show that the popularity of IXP RSes has led to a proliferation of multilateral (ML) peerings. However, a majority of the traffic exchanged at a typical IXP is still via BL peerings. As more networks explore the best ways to use their ML peerings (e.g., as backup, primary connection, or for specific traffic or peers) and incorporate them into their complex peering decision-making processes, the current picture is likely to change. If IXPs continue to innovate and improve RS functionalities, new research efforts will be needed to develop and deploy appropriate monitoring infrastructures to sense possible changes in the future Internet peering ecosystem and understand the reasons behind them.

In this context, although the IXP-provided data used in this study is proprietary, we show in Section 4 how it can be used to increase the value of publicly available datasets for future studies. For example, proprietary data often enables a direct comparison between inferred connections (based on publicly available information) and actual connections (based on proprietary information), as illustrated by calibrating the quality of BGP measurements from RS-LGes in selective IXPs.

Such vetted public data would be particularly useful in monitoring the impact of the recently launched Open IX (OIX) initiative [11]. This initiative aims to bring more peering opportunities to the US interconnection marketplace, which has historically been dominated by a small number of players focused on private peering. As a result, prices for cross connects in major US metropolitan areas are about six times higher than in major European cities. Early developments related to the OIX initiative include the establishment of new European-style IXPs in the USA by the largest European IXPs (e.g., LINX in Northern Virginia [9], AMS-IX and DE-CIX in New York [1, 3]) and a formal certification process for commercial data center and colocation providers to house certified IXPs. Only time will tell if these developments will bring about the desired changes in the US peering ecosystem, but our findings point to the need for data collection efforts to assess the actual impact of OIX in the US (e.g., encouraging the deployment of RS-LGes by US IXPs and continuous data collection from these new vantage points).

#### 9.3 Innovation in Inter-Domain Routing

Based on our description of today’s RSes, their popularity is understandable because establishing connectivity via a RS is simple (requiring essentially one BGP session setup), efficient (receiving routes to a significant part of the Internet), and quick (able to start exchanging traffic immediately). In this sense, the recent RS offerings by IXPs can be seen as an innovation in inter-domain routing, an area known for resisting changes to the status quo (i.e., BGP).

More importantly, our discussions of the design and operations of today’s IXP RSes show that they do not forward any data traffic and adhere to a strict separation of control plane and data plane. This makes RS design and operations a prime candidate for Software-Defined Networking (SDN), suggesting that IXPs are natural places for harnessing SDN's power to improve or revolutionize inter-domain routing. The concept of a software-defined Internet exchange (SDX) is explored in a recent paper [27], which considers novel approaches to innovation at IXP RSes, including software support for a range of policies for inter-domain traffic engineering with BGP that are difficult to perform using current RS capabilities.

By describing how RSes are used in practice, our work is complementary to [27] and raises questions concerning flexibility, trust, and security. Addressing these issues as part of the SDX effort would have far-reaching implications, especially since they have prevented some larger players from relying on IXP RSes. For example, member ASes that want to control which prefixes are advertised to which other member ASes typically have the BGP know-how to peer bilaterally to achieve the desired control over the traffic they receive. While the use of the RS does not preclude such control, bilateral peering offers additional opportunities for BGP traffic engineering (e.g., AS-path prepending, MED, scoped advertisements [39]) that are currently not fully supported by RSes. More generally, expanding the effort described in [27] to include bilateral peering as part of the proposed SDX approach is an interesting open problem.

Regarding trust-related issues, IXP operators are aware of concerns that some member ASes have about RS availability, operations, monitoring/debugging capabilities, and security. Currently, there are no SLAs for the RS itself, but most IXPs operate redundant RSes. From an operational perspective, there are numerous opportunities for misconfigurations at the RS (e.g., filter setup, mismatches with routing registries), and monitoring capabilities at today’s RSes are still in their infancy. In terms of security, an RS adds an additional middleman that must be trusted with the proper handling of all route advertisements. Large IXPs may be opportune places for future deployment of BGP security mechanisms such as sBGP [37].

### 10. Conclusion

Using a collection of IXP-provided datasets that offer unprecedented visibility into the control plane (i.e., BGP data from the RS) and data plane (i.e., sFlow measurements) as seen at two European IXPs, we report an in-depth study of IXP RSes to understand an IXP’s full-fledged public peering fabric. This includes the existence of peerings (i.e., connectivity) and their usage (i.e., traffic) and how they are used by different players and for what reasons. We obtain an accurate picture of the relative importance of ML peerings (large in numbers but responsible for only a minority of the traffic) versus BL peerings (small in numbers but carrying the bulk of the traffic).

More importantly, when moving beyond the traditional link-level perspective of peering and examining the correlation between the control and data plane views at the prefix level, reasoning about which ASes peer with which other networks (e.g., how and for what reasons) becomes feasible. This leads to new insights into how the IXPs’ RSes are used by their member ASes and demonstrates that these RSes are quickly becoming critical enablers for connectivity and integral entities of today’s Internet inter-domain routing system, deserving the full attention of networking researchers.
