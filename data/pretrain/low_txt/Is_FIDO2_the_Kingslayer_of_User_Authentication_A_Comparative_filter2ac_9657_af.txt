### During Setup:
- **User Requirements for 2FA:**
  - Information provided during registration about additional authentication options.
- **User Settings:**
  - Information given to the user if they click on "Learn more" or search account settings after setup.

### Security Concerns and Recommendations:

1. **Recovery and Revocation:**
   - **Concern:** Users may be hesitant to adopt FIDO2 due to concerns about account recovery and revocation.
   - **Recommendation:** Users should be able to securely revoke access to their account without first recovering access themselves. This can be inspired by established solutions like key revocation in PKI [31] or GPG, or revisiting key sharing as in Pico [27].

2. **Corner Cases:**
   - **Concern:** Some participants noted that the Yubico Security Key cannot be used on devices without an accessible USB port. Unlike passwords, which can be entered anywhere, token-based authentication currently has corner cases where it is not applicable (e.g., public or embedded computers without accessible USB, Bluetooth, or NFC interfaces).
   - **Recommendation:** Users should be informed about these corner cases, as layman users may not predict the consequences of the combination of client devices and authenticators.

3. **Form and Features of the Authenticator:**
   - **Concerns:** Participants pointed out issues with the Yubico Security Key, including limited connectivity, lack of support for other client devices (e.g., mobile phones via NFC or Bluetooth), price, robustness, usability, and the need to carry an extra device.
   - **Recommendation:** Since FIDO2 does not define the form of the authenticator, there is an opportunity to tailor authenticator form and features to user demands. For example, using mobile phones, which are widely owned and carried, and increasingly equipped with biometrics and multiple media (NFC, Bluetooth). Other forms, such as wearables, could also be considered, but the security implications of losing or misusing these devices must be addressed.

4. **Establishing Mental Models:**
   - **Concern:** Participants automatically associated "authentication" with "passwords" and did not have a mental model of how passwordless authentication with a security key works, its benefits, drawbacks, or applicability.
   - **Recommendation:** Transition to FIDO2 passwordless authentication requires establishing mental models for users. This can be done by drawing from existing models about physical keys (e.g., possession of a key means no one else can access the account; spare keys can and should be used; do not store them with personally identifying information; associate the account with the right physical key, etc.).

### Threats to Validity:

- **Participant Demographics:**
  - Our participants were comparatively young, a common issue in university lab studies. However, the ATI scores in our sample are comparable to those in studies with a more diverse age distribution, suggesting that our results are transferable to age-diverse samples.
  
- **Artificial Scenarios:**
  - We used artificial scenarios for hands-on tasks because FIDO2 passwordless authentication is not reliably supported by any service. The setup phase was simplistic, but the Yubico Security Key was plug-and-play, even for Group1FAcon with minimal instructions. This allowed us to study the larger context of users switching to 1FA and derive concrete recommendations for future studies and user registration processes.

- **Authenticator Type and Behavioral Data:**
  - We only used one type of authenticator (Yubico Security Key) and did not collect behavioral data (e.g., time required for the login process). Future work could follow a quantitative approach to test the usability and acceptance of different types of authenticators and their effects on the efficiency of the login process.

### Conclusion:

The FIDO2 standard has great potential to replace text-based passwords for user authentication on the web. Our large-scale lab study with participants using a Yubico Security Key showed that users consider FIDO2 passwordless authentication more usable and acceptable than traditional password-based authentication. However, concerns remain, particularly about the fear of losing the authenticator, limited applicability, and critiques of the authenticator devices. Addressing these concerns is crucial for the success of FIDO2. Fulfilling users' subjective needs will determine the adoption and success of this new authentication technology.
