## Abstract
Free Basics, an initiative by Facebook, aims to provide users in developing countries with free mobile Internet access to selected services. Despite its widespread deployment and potential to bridge the digital divide, there is a lack of rigorous studies measuring the quality of the service. This paper characterizes the quality of Free Basics in Pakistan and South Africa along three dimensions: (i) the selection of accessible web services, (ii) the functionality of those services, and (iii) the network performance for those services. Our preliminary findings highlight the importance of data-driven studies for informed public debates on the pros and cons of the current design of Free Basics.

## 1. Introduction
Internet.org, founded and led by Facebook since 2013, aims to bring affordable Internet access to everyone. Free Basics, the flagship initiative of Internet.org, offers free access to select web services in partnership with mobile service providers in developing and under-developed countries. As of May 12th, 2016, Free Basics has been deployed in over 40 countries across Africa, Asia, and Central and South America, reaching a total population of over 1.26 billion (22% of the world’s population). These countries have low Internet penetration rates (on average less than 20.4% of their population access the Internet), but high mobile phone usage rates (on average about 101.7%). If successfully deployed worldwide, Free Basics has the potential to bridge the digital divide.

### Motivation
Our study is motivated by the question: "Free Basics is free, but at what quality?" There is limited measurement data on the quality of Free Basics services or how the service quality is affected by its design. Gathering data on Free Basics is challenging because existing measurement infrastructures that use the traditional Internet cannot reach into the walled Internet of Free Basics services and users. Data-driven studies are necessary to inform public debates about Free Basics, which in early 2016 led to Indian telecommunication regulators blocking the service for over a billion potential users.

### How Free Basics Works
The Free Basics service comprises three independent service providers:
1. **Network Service Provider**: Cellular carriers that agree to carry data for any Free Basics service at no cost to the end user.
2. **Free Basics Proxy Service Provider**: All Free Basics traffic is routed via proxies run by Facebook.
3. **Web Service Providers**: Web site operators must redesign their services to meet technical requirements and apply for approval by the proxy service provider.

The Free Basics platform is open to any web service that meets the stated technical requirements (e.g., absence of JavaScript, high-resolution images, videos, or iFrames). These restrictions support the target population of mobile users in developing regions, where devices may not have full web browsers and must access the Internet via WAP or similar technologies.

Any mobile subscriber of the participating network service providers can access the list of approved web services by going to freebasics.com using their mobile browser or by installing the Free Basics mobile application while connected to their cellular provider’s network.

### Our Goal: Assess the QoS of Free Basics
In this paper, we focus on understanding the impact of the Free Basics architecture on the Quality-of-Service (QoS) offered in practice. Specifically, we assess the QoS provided by the three service providers comprising Free Basics:
1. **Proxy Service**: Characterize the selection of web services accessible via proxy on Free Basics.
2. **Web Services**: Compare the functionalities of web services tailored for Free Basics to their unmodified versions on the Internet.
3. **Network Service**: Analyze the network performance (measured as bandwidth, latency, and page download times) for Free Basics traffic compared to paid traffic to the same site on the same carrier.

We perform these analyses using data from a preliminary study of Free Basics deployments in Pakistan and South Africa, gathered between April and August 2016. Our measurements show that while several tens of web services are accessible on Free Basics, their functionality is somewhat restricted, and the network performance for Free Basics traffic is poor compared to paid network access.

## 2. Measurement Methodology
To assess the QoS of the three service providers comprising Free Basics, we need to gather data on:
- The set of Free Basics web services.
- The webpages of these services to analyze the functionality they offer and the network performance while downloading them.
- The webpages of the same web services on the normal Internet to compare the QoS of a Free Basics service with the QoS of the normal version (using paid access).

### Experimental Setup
To measure Free Basics, we created experimental testbeds at the Lahore University of Management Sciences in Pakistan and the University of Cape Town in South Africa. The authors from each location set up a smartphone with the necessary SIM connection, which acts as a Wi-Fi hotspot with a desktop tethered to it. We used a remote connection to the desktop to measure Free Basics via crawler scripts (with browser user-agent spoofed to an appropriate mobile web browser) and network monitoring tools.

### Data Gathered
Using our testbed, we gathered the following data:
- The list of all web services accessible via Free Basics in both Pakistan and South Africa.
- The homepages of all web services available in Pakistan and some additional pages for a subset of services for network performance analysis.
- The pages for the normal Internet versions of the same services, over the same cellular provider but with paid network connection.

## 3. Assessing QoS of Free Basics
In this section, we characterize the selection of Free Basics web services and compare the functionality and network access quality of these web services to their normal Internet counterparts (using paid access).

### 3.1 Selection of Accessible Web Services
We explored the web services accessible via Free Basics deployments in Pakistan and South Africa. As of May 2016, there were 74 services in Pakistan and 101 in South Africa. We manually categorized the services according to their functionality and relevance (Figure 2).

- **Functionality Categories**: Education, news, health, networking, entertainment, and jobs.
- **Relevance Categories**: Global, country-specific, and developing region.

A significant fraction of services fall into the education, news, health, networking, entertainment, and jobs categories. A higher proportion of locally relevant services are available in Pakistan compared to South Africa.

### 3.2 Functionality of Accessible Web Services
To understand the impact of Free Basics’ technical requirements on service quality, we compared the Free Basics versions of services with their normal Internet counterparts. Specifically, we downloaded the homepages of all Free Basics services in Pakistan for both the Free Basics and the normal Internet version.

### Effect of Technical Specifications
Figure 5(a) shows a CDF of the ratio of the sizes of these homepages, normal compared to Free Basics. We observed that 80% of the services have larger sizes and potentially richer content for the paid version compared to the Free Basics version.

## 4. Conclusion
Our preliminary findings highlight the importance of data-driven studies for informed public debates on the pros and cons of the current design of Free Basics. While our measurement results provide insights, they are not sufficient to make a strong case for or against Free Basics. We conclude the paper by outlining our future plans for extending this work.
