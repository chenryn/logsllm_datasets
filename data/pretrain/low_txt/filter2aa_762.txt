## About the Presenter
Which of the following is false?
1. Have had 10 knee surgeries and 5 other surgeries.
2. Worked at JHUAPL, primarily on weapon system assessments.
3. Was voted "most athletic" in high school—don't judge a book by its cover ;)
4. Previously ran assessments at the 92d Information Warfare Aggressor Squadron (USAF), now part of the 92d Information Operations Squadron, focusing on vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and red teaming.
5. Holds a B.S. in Computer Engineering from RPI, an Aeronautical degree, and additional studies in MIS and CS from JHU.
6. External Metasploit developer since February 2013.
7. Had command and control of 50 nuclear ICBMs on 9/11—an interesting story.

## Overview
### What is CEC?
- **Consumer Electronics Control (CEC)** is a feature defined in the HDMI specification.
- It allows users to command and control up to 15 devices.
- Can relay commands from remote controls.
- Automatically changes TV inputs.
- Vendor-extendable and adopted by other technologies.

### Specs & Implementations
- **HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface)**: An interface specification implemented as cables and connectors, succeeding DVI.
- **CEC Details**:
  - 1-wire bidirectional serial bus.
  - Slow: 500 bit/s.
  - Uses AV.link protocol for remote control functions.
  - Mandatory CEC wiring, but optional software support.

### Notable Implementations
- Various trade names in the commercial industry:
  - Anynet+ (Samsung)
  - Aquos Link (Sharp)
  - BRAVIA Link/Sync (Sony)
  - SimpLink (LG)
  - VIERA Link (Panasonic)
  - EasyLink (Philips)

- Open Source:
  - libCEC (dual commercial license)
  - Android HDMI-CEC

### Previous Research
- **HDMI – Hacking Displays Made Interesting** by Andy Davis, BlackHat EU 2012.
- GUI Python CEC fuzzer, somewhat simplistic with no exception monitoring or crash data gathering.

### Why This Research?
- To explore an area relatively untouched.
- Personal preference: assembly > C/C++ and RISC > CISC.
- Additional attack vector for mobile devices via:
  - Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL)
  - Slimport
  - Many car stereos

### My Son's Obsession
- My son is completely obsessed with cords and wires, especially HDMI.

### Remote Control Protocol
- **History**:
  - Version 1.0 (Dec 2002): Initial release.
  - Version 1.1 (May 2004): Minor updates.
  - Version 1.2 (Aug 2005): Further enhancements.
  - Version 1.2a (Dec 2005): Fully specified CEC.
  - Version 1.3-3c ('06-'08): Advanced A/V and new connections.
  - Version 1.4 (May 2009): Features like 4k, HEC, ARC, 3D, and micro.
  - Version 2.0 (Sep 2013): 4k @60fps, Dual View, 3D++, CEC++.

### Interesting 1.4 Features
- **ARC (Audio Return Channel)**
- **HEC (HDMI Ethernet Connection)**
  - 100Mb/s
  - Enables traditional networking over HDMI

### Fuzzing CEC
- **Some Results**:
  - jalr $t9; strncpy => 409
  - jalr $t9; memcpy => 310
  - jalr $t9; [.*]printf => 11685
  - Most are not called by CEC code.
  - 3 memcpy's, 2 of which were manually found.
  - 73 printf's, but not yet exploitable.

### Post Exploitation
- Enable HEC
- Enable LAN
- Attack LAN services if necessary
- Enable higher speed exfiltration
- Control MHL device
- Beachhead for attacking other devices

### Future Work
- Unuglify Python code.
- Integrate into a more comprehensive fuzz framework.
- Exploit CEC and bind shell to network interface.
- Explore attack surface of:
  - HDMI: 3D, Audio Return Channel, more with HEC.
  - Feature additions in CEC (HDMI 2.0).
  - More devices.
  - Emulation.

### Conclusion
- CEC is becoming more pervasive and invasive.
- Old vulnerabilities may resurface.
- Code is newer, possibly benefiting from better practices.
- Hard, sometimes impossible, to upgrade, maintain, and configure.
- Risk = Vulnerability x Exposure x Impact
- Exposure is growing.
- Impact is highest for privacy.
