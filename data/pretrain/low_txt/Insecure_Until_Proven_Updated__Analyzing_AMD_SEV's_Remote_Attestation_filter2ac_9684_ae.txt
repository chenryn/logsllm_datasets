**Firmware Security and Migration Protection**

PSP (Platform Security Processor) firmware versions that do not contain known security issues are considered secure. The migration of an SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization)-protected virtual machine to a PSP firmware version lower than the one specified in the guest policy is not permitted. This safeguard protects against the Migration Attack described in Section 5.2.

**Related Work**

Research such as [18, 23, 29, 33, 34, 36] has demonstrated that protecting virtual machines from an untrusted hypervisor is a well-studied area.

In [36], Zhang et al. propose the use of a higher-privileged security monitor called CloudVisor to protect virtual machines in the event of a compromised hypervisor. Their attack model assumes the cloud provider is not malicious, thus excluding physical attacks. CloudVisor's design, which is similar to AMD SEV, aims to separate resource management from security protection in the virtualization layer. The prototype version of CloudVisor, implemented in only 5.5K lines of code, works with the Xen hypervisor. 

Zhang et al. leverage a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) in two ways: 
1. Ensuring the integrity of the CloudVisor code using the TPM and Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT).
2. Providing confidential communication between the cloud customer and CloudVisor, rooted in the Storage Root Key (SRK) of the TPM. The SRK has the lifetime of the platform owner and is authenticated by the Endorsement Key (EK) of the TPM. The EK keypair is unique per TPM chip, binding the TPM’s identity. The private key must never leave the TPM. The TPM manufacturer provides certificates of the EK public key through a certificate authority (CA). Given that the specific identities of TPMs used for CloudVisor are guaranteed by a third party, this enables the cloud customer to authenticate intermediate keys signed by the EK, which can then be used for confidential communication.

With AMD SEV, the Chip Endorsement Key (CEK) serves a similar purpose to the EK of a TPM, binding the identity of an SEV-capable CPU using chip-unique one-time-programmable fuses.

While the remote attestation mechanism of SEV has not been extensively researched, several attacks have been presented against its runtime protection.

In 2017, Hetzelt and Buhren conducted the first security analysis of SEV technology [15]. They proposed three attacks on an SEV-enabled system, two of which exploit the lack of protection for the Virtual Machine Control Block (VMCB) and registers. These vulnerabilities are mitigated if the encrypted state extension to SEV is enabled, as discussed in Section 2.2. The third attack leverages the missing integrity protection of the guest memory, allowing the hypervisor to conduct a replay attack. By altering the nested pagetable, they forced a pagefault on every guest page executed, and showed that the sequence of pagefaults could determine the location of a password in the target VM’s memory. The page containing the password was then replayed during an attacker-initiated SSH login, enabling the authors to gain root access to a target system protected by SEV.

Morbitzer et al. [25] used the hypervisor's control over guest resources, specifically the nested pagetables, to attack an SEV-protected VM. In a similar manner to [15], they used page tracking to identify a guest page served via a server running in the VM. As the memory is encrypted with a guest-specific key, the server will copy the data to an unencrypted page, such as the buffer of a virtual network card. Once this page is located, they manipulate the nested pagetable to change the mapping between guest physical pages and host physical pages. The new mapping points to confidential data of the VM, causing the server to copy the confidential data into the unencrypted buffer, which is then readable by the attacker. Using this method, the authors were able to fully decrypt a VM with 2GB of memory.

In 2018, CTS Labs published a whitepaper titled "AMDFlaws," claiming to have found multiple critical vulnerabilities in AMD processors, allowing arbitrary code execution on the PSP [21]. The whitepaper details conceptual information about vulnerabilities in both Epyc and Ryzen PSPs, as well as alleged manufacturer backdoors in the firmware and hardware of AMD chipsets supporting Ryzen CPUs. In 2019, two members of CTS Labs presented insights into three vulnerabilities from the AMDFlaws publication [13]. They provided details about the PSP firmware and cryptographic checks but did not discuss the consequences of a compromised PSP on the SEV technology.

**Conclusion**

In this paper, we analyzed the firmware components that implement the SEV API and identified security issues in the secure boot mechanism of the PSP that hosts the SEV firmware. This allowed us to provide a patched version of the SEV firmware, giving us arbitrary read and write access to the PSP’s memory. We used this firmware to extract the Chip Endorsement Key (CEK) of three different AMD Epyc processors. We proposed two attacks against SEV-protected virtual machines using the extracted CEK, as well as an attack based on a patched SEV firmware. While the patched firmware allowed us to extract encrypted memory in plaintext, the extracted CEK allows an attacker to impersonate the presence of SEV altogether. Even if the targeted virtual machine is not executed on a compromised SEV platform, the migration attack allows an attacker to acquire the cryptographic keys used to encrypt the virtual machines during migration.

The severity of these attacks is amplified due to the lack of rollback prevention and the infinite lifetime of the CEK. We demonstrated that an attacker can always roll back to a vulnerable PSP firmware to extract the CEK. Even if the PSP firmware is upgraded to a newer version, the extracted CEK remains valid for the corresponding CPU.

In the current design of the SEV technology, it is impossible for a cloud customer to verify the integrity of the remote platform given the existence of a vulnerable firmware version. We conclude that the SEV technology on AMD Epyc systems of the Naples CPU series cannot protect virtual machines as the correct deployment cannot be guaranteed. Given the lifetime of the CEK, it is not possible to provide purely software-based mitigations.

To address these issues, we proposed design changes to SEV that enable the cloud customer to enforce the use of a specific PSP firmware on the remote platform. This ensures the trustworthiness of the SEV technology despite PSP firmware issues, as it allows for the issuance of software-based fixes for the PSP firmware.
