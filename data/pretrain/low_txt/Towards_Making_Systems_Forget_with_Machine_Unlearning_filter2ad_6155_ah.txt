### Privacy, Security, and Usability

Privacy, security, and usability are key benefits of the discussed systems. For privacy, these systems allow users to remove their sensitive data, ensuring that no residual traces remain in the system. In terms of security, they enable service providers to eliminate polluted training data, thereby maintaining the accuracy and reliability of anomaly detectors. From a usability perspective, these systems help users remove noise and incorrect entries from analytics data, ensuring that recommendation engines provide useful and accurate suggestions.

### Machine Unlearning: The First Step Towards System Forgetfulness

We have introduced machine unlearning, which is the first step towards enabling systems to forget. Our unlearning approach targets machine learning systems, a critical and widely used class of systems. This method transforms some or all learning algorithms into a summation form. To forget a training data sample, unlearning updates a small number of summations, making it asymptotically faster than retraining from scratch. Our unlearning approach is general and applicable to many machine learning algorithms. Evaluations on real-world systems and workloads have shown that our approach is general, effective, fast, and easy to use.

### Future Directions

While unlearning is an important first step, much work remains to be done. We plan to develop full-fledged forgetting systems that meticulously track data lineage at various levels of granularity, across all operations, and potentially at the Web scale. We invite other researchers to join us in exploring this exciting direction.
