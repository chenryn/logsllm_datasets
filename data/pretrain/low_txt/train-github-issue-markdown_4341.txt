When searching within a directory (by right-clicking on the folder in the left-hand pane) for the string "verify," the search results indicate that "69 results were found in 13 files for 'verify'." However, only four files are listed, and the remaining results are not displayed. I am inclined to believe that the text is correct, as I am aware of additional files in the subdirectory that contain the string "verify" but are not shown.

The folder I am attempting to search is greyed out (I am searching a subdirectory of the "vendor" directory in a Symfony 2 PHP project), but I have the "Exclude VCS Ignored Paths" option unchecked in my settings. The issue persists even when Atom is run with the `--safe` switch and occurs regardless of whether the regex option is used.

I am using Windows 8.1 with Atom 0.153.0 installed via Chocolatey. Please refer to the screenshot below (some directory names have been redacted).
