### Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites

**Description:**
Adversaries may exfiltrate data to text storage sites as an alternative to their primary command and control (C2) channel. Text storage sites, such as Pastebin, are commonly used by developers to share code and other information. These sites can also be leveraged to host malicious code for C2 communication, such as [Stage Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608). Additionally, adversaries may use these sites to exfiltrate collected data. Paid features and encryption options on these platforms can help adversaries conceal and store data more securely.

**Note:** This technique is distinct from [Exfiltration to Code Repository](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/001), which involves accessing code repositories via APIs.

### Credentials in Files

**Description:**
Adversaries may search local file systems and remote file shares for files containing passwords. These files can include user-created password storage, shared credential stores, configuration files with embedded passwords, or source code/binary files with hardcoded credentials.

Passwords can also be extracted from backups or saved virtual machines through [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). In cloud environments, authenticated user credentials are often stored in local configuration and credential files, which can be copied and reused on another machine or read directly for authentication.

### Software

**Description:**
Adversaries may gather information about the victim's host software to identify potential targets. This information can include details about installed software types and versions, as well as the presence of additional security components like antivirus or SIEMs.

Adversaries can collect this information through various methods, such as active scanning, phishing, or compromising websites to collect host information from visitors. Information about installed software may also be exposed through publicly accessible data sets. Gathering this information can reveal opportunities for further reconnaissance, establishing operational resources, and initial access.

### Netsh Helper DLL

**Description:**
Netsh.exe is a command-line scripting utility used to interact with the network configuration of a system. It can load helper DLLs to extend its functionality. Adversaries can use netsh.exe with helper DLLs to proxy the execution of arbitrary code persistently when netsh.exe is executed automatically or by other persistent software.

Proof-of-concept code exists to load Cobalt Strike's payload using netsh.exe helper DLLs.

### Input Capture

**Description:**
Adversaries may use methods to capture user input to obtain credentials or collect information. During normal system usage, users often provide credentials to various locations, such as login pages or system dialog boxes. Input capture mechanisms can be transparent to the user (e.g., [Credential API Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004)) or rely on deceiving the user into providing input to what they believe is a genuine service (e.g., [Web Portal Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/003)).

### Exploits

**Description:**
Adversaries may develop exploits to take advantage of bugs or vulnerabilities in computer hardware or software. Instead of finding or modifying existing exploits, adversaries may create their own. They may use information acquired via [Vulnerabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/006) to focus their exploit development efforts. Techniques such as fuzzing and patch analysis can uncover exploitable vulnerabilities.

Exploit development may require different skill sets, which may be in-house or contracted out. Adversaries may use exploits during various phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as [Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190) and [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203).

### Social Media

**Description:**
Adversaries may search social media for information about victims that can be used during targeting. Social media sites may contain various information about a victim organization, such as business announcements and details about staff roles, locations, and interests.

Adversaries may search different social media sites depending on the information they seek. They may passively harvest data or use it to create fake profiles/groups to elicit specific information (e.g., [Spearphishing Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598/001)). This information can reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance, establishing operational resources, and initial access.

### Component Object Model Hijacking

**Description:**
Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects. COM is a system within Windows that enables interaction between software components. References to COM objects are stored in the Windows Registry.

Adversaries can use the COM system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate software by hijacking COM references and relationships. This requires changing the Registry to replace a reference to a legitimate system component, potentially causing that component to malfunction. When the system component is executed, the adversary's code will run instead.

### Credentials

**Description:**
Adversaries may gather credentials that can be used during targeting. These credentials may be directly associated with the target organization or may take advantage of the tendency for users to reuse passwords across personal and business accounts.

Adversaries can gather credentials in various ways, such as through [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598) or by compromising sites to collect website authentication cookies. Credential information may also be exposed through leaks to online data sets. Adversaries may purchase credentials from dark web markets. In cases where multi-factor authentication (MFA) is used, adversaries may compromise service providers to gain access to MFA codes and one-time passwords (OTP).

Gathering this information can reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance, establishing operational resources, and initial access.

### Compromise Software Supply Chain

**Description:**
Adversaries may manipulate application software before it reaches the final consumer to compromise data or systems. Supply chain compromise of software can occur through manipulation of the application source code, the update/distribution mechanism, or by replacing compiled releases with a modified version.

Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set or distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.

### Rename System Utilities

**Description:**
Adversaries may rename legitimate system utilities to evade security mechanisms concerning the usage of those utilities. Security monitoring and control mechanisms may be in place for system utilities that adversaries can abuse. By renaming the utility prior to utilization, adversaries may bypass these security mechanisms. Alternatively, a legitimate utility may be copied or moved to a different directory and renamed to avoid detections based on non-standard paths.

### Bidirectional Communication

**Description:**
Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for sending commands to and receiving output from a compromised system over the Web service channel. Compromised systems may leverage popular websites and social media to host command and control (C2) instructions. The return traffic may occur in various ways, such as posting a comment on a forum, issuing a pull request to a development project, updating a document hosted on a Web service, or by sending a Tweet.

Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, provides cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, adding an extra layer of protection for adversaries.

### Exploitation for Client Execution

**Description:**
Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in client applications to execute code. Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices, leading to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Common targets include web browsers, office applications, and other common third-party applications.

### Wordlist Scanning

**Description:**
Adversaries may iteratively probe infrastructure using brute-forcing and crawling techniques. While this technique employs similar methods to [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110), its goal is the identification of content and infrastructure rather than the discovery of valid credentials. Wordlists used in these scans may contain generic, commonly used names and file extensions or terms specific to a particular software. Adversaries may also create custom, target-specific wordlists using data gathered from other Reconnaissance techniques.

For example, adversaries may use web content discovery tools such as Dirb, DirBuster, and GoBuster to enumerate a website’s pages and directories. This can help them discover old, vulnerable pages or hidden administrative portals that could become the target of further operations. As cloud storage solutions typically use globally unique names, adversaries may also use target-specific wordlists and tools to enumerate public and private buckets on cloud infrastructure.

### Spoof Security Alerting

**Description:**
Adversaries may spoof security alerting from tools, presenting false evidence to impair defenders' awareness of malicious activity. Messages produced by defensive tools contain information about potential security events and the functioning status of security software and the system. Security reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system and identifying important events that can signal a security incident.

Rather than or in addition to [Indicator Blocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/006), an adversary can spoof positive affirmations that security tools are continuing to function even after legitimate security tools have been disabled (e.g., [Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001)). An adversary can also present a "healthy" system status even after infection, delaying defender responses.

For example, adversaries may show a fake Windows Security GUI and tray icon with a "healthy" system status after Windows Defender and other system tools have been disabled.
