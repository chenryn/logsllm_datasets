It seems that when we make changes to `std`, a complete rebuild of Deno, along with running the full test suite, may be unnecessary for validating those changes. We should consider implementing a mechanism that allows us to test `std` independently, possibly against a prebuilt version of Deno. This would streamline the development process and reduce the time required for validation.
