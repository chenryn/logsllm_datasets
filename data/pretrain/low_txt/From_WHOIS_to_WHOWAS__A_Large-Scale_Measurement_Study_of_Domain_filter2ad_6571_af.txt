### Clustering of Malicious Domain Names and Its Impact on Accuracy

The accuracy of clustering malicious domain names is significantly affected when WHOIS records are redacted. For instance, both malicious and benign domains may be clustered together if their WHOIS records are redacted by the same provider. 

Based on Observation 1, systems developed under previous research need to be re-engineered, as most WHOIS providers now comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Additionally, since many non-European Economic Area (EEA) domains are also redacted (as per Observation 5), the impact is further amplified. This makes it easier for attackers to evade detection and tracing, even if they are not EEA citizens.

### Remediation

The ICANN Temporary Specification proposes a tiered-access framework to be implemented by registrars and registries, allowing legitimate use of WHOIS data (e.g., for law enforcement and commercial litigation). Some providers, such as Tucows, have already implemented such systems (e.g., https://tieredaccess.com).

However, a recent survey [25] indicates that over 70% of access requests are denied by WHOIS providers, often due to the lack of a court order. The IETF has proposed the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) [77] to replace the WHOIS protocol, designed to allow specifically authorized individuals to access private registration data. However, we have not found clear instructions or links regarding the authorization process in existing systems.

In the long term, deploying the tiered-access framework and RDAP remains the right direction, though the operational model should be better designed to minimize hurdles for security researchers. In the short term, ICANN should refine the requirements listed in the Temporary Specification and suggest a data redaction policy that balances data utility and privacy. For example, registration information (including name, email address, and street) is crucial for domain clustering. Currently, these fields are often replaced with fixed values like "redacted for privacy" or left empty, reducing the effectiveness of domain clustering. To address this, the use of fuzzy hashing [32] could be recommended, which measures the distance between two fields without revealing their original values.

### Discussion

Our measurement results show that the GDPR's impact on the Internet domain community is substantial, with most WHOIS providers actively redacting WHOIS records for compliance. However, we also find a significant number of partially- or non-compliant providers, some of whom make mistakes during data redaction. Below are our recommendations for different stakeholders to improve GDPR compliance.

#### Recommendations

1. **ICANN and Legal Authorities:**
   - The one-week window between the ICANN Temporary Specification and the GDPR effective date was too short, leading to excessive data redaction for non-EEA domains. A more efficient format for discussions between legal authorities and technical communities should be adopted to provide more time for policy execution. This would benefit stakeholders when new privacy policies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), are enforced.
   - The language in the ICANN Temporary Specification leaves room for interpretation, causing confusion among WHOIS providers. Implementation flaws have been identified. Additionally, the document's flexibility in defining the scope of data protection leads some registrars to sanitize all WHOIS records, despite ICANN's intention to limit changes to EEA domains only. We recommend that ICANN provide more specific instructions, best practice guidance for technical operators, and tools for compliance checking, rather than relying solely on complaint reports.

2. **WHOIS Providers:**
   - Revisit and fix errors in the redaction process, such as masking only a portion of the registrant's fields. Develop tools for periodic inspection and automated error correction.
   - Deploy auxiliary systems for email forwarding or tiered WHOIS access to ensure that legitimate requests (e.g., from security researchers) can be fulfilled.

3. **Security Researchers and Companies:**
   - Reassess and adjust applications that rely on WHOIS data for tasks like malicious domain detection. Retrain detection models by removing redacted fields to maintain effectiveness.
   - Push regulators for restricted API access to data and automatic notifications to registrants. Cooperate with large domain registrars for a more uniform data redaction approach that balances privacy protection and research needs. Consider adopting fuzzy hashing on protected fields instead of using the same redaction string. Evaluate the impact of different redaction methods.

### Online Checking Tool

To help WHOIS providers understand their current GDPR compliance status, we have designed and released an online checking tool (https://whoisgdprcompliance.info). After identity verification, a user representing the provider can view the weekly outlier ratio and a sample of outlying domain names under their organization. Large registrars and ICANN staff have shown interest in using this tool.

### Related Work

Several studies have examined the real-world impact of the GDPR, focusing on web privacy, usable security, and compliance checking.

#### GDPR and Web Privacy

The expanded territorial scope of the GDPR has prompted many websites to adjust their web privacy policies. Studies have reported that many EU member state websites have deployed new privacy policies and displayed cookie consent notices. Different types of cookie notices are displayed based on the visitor's country. Recent works have measured the impact of the GDPR on the online tracking ecosystem and advertising business. Our findings echo these, highlighting the timely response to the GDPR.

#### GDPR and Usable Security

Cookie consent notices have become prevalent due to GDPR enforcement, requiring users to take actions such as clicking "Accept Cookies." User interactions with these notices depend on their implementation, and problematic designs have been identified. Deceptive and misleading language in consents can lead to misinterpretation. While opt-out options are provided, practical implementation issues make it difficult for users to avoid being tracked, sometimes conflicting with regulations.

#### GDPR Compliance Check

Frameworks based on semantic analysis have been proposed to analyze legal documents for GDPR compliance and detect violations of privacy norms. Similarly, knowledge graphs have been used to generate rules and regulations for cloud data providers and customers. Automated approaches, including machine learning, have been proposed to analyze privacy documents.

#### GDPR-Compliant System Design

Recent works have rethought system design in the era of the GDPR, measuring the cost of compliance. Performance of GDPR-compliant databases scales poorly with increased personal data volume, and frictions between cloud-scale systems and the GDPR have been discussed. Building clean-slate GDPR-compliant systems is non-trivial.

### Conclusion

This paper presents the first systematic and large-scale measurement study on the GDPR compliance process of domain WHOIS data providers. We highlight the profound impact of GDPR enforcement on domain WHOIS services, identify flawed implementations of GDPR compliance, and show that the scope of privacy protection is often excessive, causing a global impact on the WHOIS system. To quantify the impact on academic research, we conducted a survey and found that 69% of surveyed papers need to use redacted WHOIS information. Our results call for a review of current data redaction strategies, and we release an online checking tool to help stakeholders gain a better view of their compliance status.
