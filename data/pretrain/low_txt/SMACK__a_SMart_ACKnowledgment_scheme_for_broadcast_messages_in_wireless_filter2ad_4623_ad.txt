### 10.1 Reducing Redundant Rebroadcasts

We can extend our single-hop ACK mechanism to reduce redundant rebroadcasts in multi-hop wireless networks by selecting a remote neighbor for the next broadcast in a network-wide transmission. This approach leverages physical layer signaling to estimate the relative distances of neighbors by detecting concurrent ACKs. Due to the near-far effect, the signal from a "near" node arrives before that of a "far" node, as illustrated in Figure 4. This can be detected at the physical layer using multiple overlapping Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) at the beginning of signal reception. Among the set of nodes that respond, we can determine which ones are farther away (assuming they take the same amount of overhead time to start the ACK transmission). By exploiting this information, we can select the farthest node for retransmission of the broadcast, thereby building a reliable broadcast protocol in multi-hop mesh networks with a minimum number of broadcast packets, thus mitigating the broadcast storm.

### 10.2 Parallel Polling

Concurrent communication mechanisms can be utilized to poll nodes and determine whether they have packets to transmit. Based on the polling results, the medium access mechanism can be ascertained. The parallel polling mechanism can be employed by the Access Point (AP) [21] to query its clients about their queue lengths. Based on the responses, the AP can assign variable slots to the clients for uninterrupted transmission. This mechanism is faster than other polling methods, which require the transmission of a series of packets by all participating nodes to gather responses.

### 11. Related Work

This paper presents the detection of concurrent transmissions as a mechanism to acknowledge broadcast/multicast packets. Mitigating broadcast storms and ensuring reliable broadcasts are two interrelated issues addressed by many researchers in various ways. To reduce redundant broadcasts, several schemes have been proposed, including probabilistic, counter-based, distance-based, location-based, and cluster-based schemes [17]. However, these schemes lack an acknowledgment mechanism to ensure that each neighbor has received the message. For reliable broadcasts with permanent probabilistic failures, an asymptotic bound for the achievability of broadcast has been deduced in [5].

Acknowledgment is crucial for reporting whether a message has been successfully received by the intended recipient. The performance of various response collection methods, such as polling, TDMA, and Group Testing, has been compared in [3]. These protocols require the transmission of multiple packets by different nodes, which are distributed temporally. In contrast, our protocol collects responses simultaneously from multiple nodes within a very short period without transmitting any response packets. Demirbas et al. [8] propose Pollcast to estimate the number of simultaneous responses by checking the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI); a collision increases the RSSI. A similar approach is used in Backcast [10], where acknowledgments are transmitted without source addresses by multiple nodes simultaneously. Results show that with fewer nodes, the ACK is decodable, and the RSSI approximately indicates the number of concurrent transmissions. Both Pollcast and Backcast cannot detect the exact neighbor who transmitted the response. Our mechanism not only correctly detects the number of concurrent transmissions but also identifies the exact neighbors involved in transmitting the acknowledgment.

The increasing popularity of Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) in current wireless technologies has led us to choose it as the underlying communication mechanism. OFDM is widely used in IEEE 802.11 WLAN [13], WiMax [14], and IEEE 802.22 WRAN [12]. Simultaneous transmission of tones or each node transmitting in a single subcarrier has the same orthogonal property but requires less complexity at the receiver to detect. OFDM/OFDMA utilizes the bandwidth by transmitting over a set of subcarriers, which requires pilot tones inserted at regular intervals in the frequency domain to capture channel coefficients and aid equalization [7]. To decode a packet transmitted over a set of subcarriers, it is necessary to equalize the received signal using information from the pilot tones. Our mechanism uses a simple energy detection scheme at the receiver, avoiding the need for equalization and baseband decoding.

OFDMA has also been introduced in cellular networks as a simultaneous communication mechanism, where subcarrier assignment [26, 15] considers a set of contiguous subcarriers. Non-contiguous OFDM [19] is popular in cognitive radio domains, where transmitters do not have access to a contiguous set of subcarriers due to the presence of primary users. In such scenarios, timing synchronization [2] and decoding the signal are challenging. Although the signal generated from multiple nodes in our case is a non-contiguous OFDM signal, our protocol only requires energy detection in each subcarrier, thus avoiding the challenges of non-contiguous OFDM communication.

Simultaneous transmissions can also be detected using multi-user detection schemes in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). To detect CDMA codes transmitted by clients, the receiver must perform correlation for all N clients/codes. Post-processing of the signal is time-consuming if an elimination process is used or extremely resource-intensive if N parallel correlators are used. To avoid this complexity, researchers [23] use various heuristic methods to obtain a suboptimal solution.

Instances of using simultaneous tone transmissions on OFDM subcarriers for higher-layer applications are rare. Roman et al. [20] use energy detection of subcarriers in a leader election protocol to eliminate contenders for channel access. They use only 8 subcarriers to indicate whether a node is contending for the wireless medium. After a few contention slots, a winner is decided, gaining access to the medium. We demonstrate the use of the signaling mechanism to address a broader array of network problems and discuss the challenges and scope of implementing such a protocol using reconfigurable hardware, which is the novelty of this work.

Spectrum sensing is integral to the evolution of cognitive radio research. Various approaches to find spectrum holes are given in [4], but the basic operation involves threshold tests to differentiate good signals from bad. Although the SNR Wall [24] remains a problem for simple detection mechanisms in cognitive domains, our protocol does not suffer from this effect. In cognitive radios, the secondary user should robustly detect the presence of a primary user even from hidden positions where the primary user's signal goes below the 'SNR Wall' and is difficult to detect by a simple threshold test. In our protocol, the tones are transmitted by clients of an AP, all one-hop neighbors. The signals from these clients are strong enough that even packets transmitted by the clients can be decoded at the AP. Thus, the signal energy is not as low as in cognitive radio domains, and a simple threshold test, as we suggest, can be used to detect the tones.

Prior works in similar domains, powered by simple implementable algorithms, have led us to explore beyond preset methods and innovate new protocols in the domain of wireless networks.

### 12. Conclusion

We have shown that by leveraging, rather than fighting against, the properties of the wireless physical media, we can develop robust signaling primitives that are both practical and enable innovative algorithms. We used an OFDM-based signaling method that is easy to understand and implement using reconfigurable hardware. We have demonstrated that if the signaling mechanism is kept simple, it not only makes certain network functions, such as reliable broadcasts, faster but can also use simple detection mechanisms to extract the required information. These primitives can be used to implement higher-level group communication and signaling protocols, as long as the queries require simple "yes/no" answers. The critical insight is that we can combine the results from multiple clients using simultaneous reception in an efficient manner to aid higher protocols to perform more efficiently.
