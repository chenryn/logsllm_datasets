This issue is a follow-up to JuliaStats/Rmath.jl#7. I believe it should be included in the 0.5.0 milestone, which is why I have created a duplicate here in the Julia repository.

To provide some context, StatsFuns.jl depends on Rmath. Previously, Rmath was part of the base Julia distribution and functioned across all platforms. However, with the changes introduced in #6131, Rmath was moved to the JuliaStats/Rmath.jl package. Unfortunately, this new package does not currently support Windows. As a result, StatsFuns.jl, and by extension, a significant portion of the Julia statistics stack, no longer functions on the Windows platform.
