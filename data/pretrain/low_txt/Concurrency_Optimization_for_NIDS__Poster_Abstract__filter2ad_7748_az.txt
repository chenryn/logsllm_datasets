**Title:** Profiling the Effect of Adult-Onset Hypothyroidism (AOH) on the Mouse Heart in Both Sexes Integrating Untargeted GC- and LC-MS Metabolomics

**Presenting Author:** Maria-Konstantina Ioannidi, Metabolic Engineering & Systems Biology Lab, Institute of Chemical Engineering Sciences, FORTH, Greece

**Co-Authors:** Marigoula Margarity, Maria I. Klapa

**Background:**
This study is part of a multi-tissue investigation (brain, heart, liver) of the effect of Adult-Onset Hypothyroidism (AOH) on the metabolic physiology of a chemical induction mouse model. The aim is to reconstruct the metabolic fingerprint of this pathophysiology at the organism level in both sexes. Here, we present the heart metabolic profiling, integrating gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-/LC-MS)-based metabolomics with systems and network biology approaches.

**Methods:**
Tissue collection from 24 mice (male/female in sets of six euthyroid/hypothyroid) was performed on the 124th postnatal day after applying an optimized tissue perfusion protocol with saline solution. An adapted metabolite extraction protocol for mouse hearts was used. Standardized data deposition and analysis were conducted using our software suite, M-IOLITE, and multivariate statistics tools. Differential metabolites were visualized within the reconstructed mouse heart primary metabolism network.

**Results and Discussion:**
The integration of GC-MS with LC-MS metabolomic analyses provided a broader overview of the mouse heart central carbon metabolism under AOH. Our results validated a lipid-centric metabolism for the heart, which becomes deregulated under AOH, characterized by decreased energy metabolism and TCA cycle activity. No extended inter-sex differences were observed, with females exhibiting greater metabolic AOH insulation through increased lipid oxidation activity. These results will be presented in comparison with the already acquired brain region metabolic profiles of the same animals towards a multi-tissue AOH metabolic physiology model.

**Title:** High-Performance Metabolomics Diagnostic Model for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

**Presenting Author:** Takeshi Kimura, St. Luke’s International University, Japan

**Co-Authors:** Masahiro Nojima, Yutaka Aoki, Kuniyoshi Hayashi, Hirotaka Fujimoto, Yuji Heike, Mariko Asami, Kazuhiko Suzuki, Kevin Urayama, Masaaki Matsuura, Takaaki Sato, Katsunori Masuda

**Background:**
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an important condition due to its association with a broad range of disorders. We aimed to identify metabolome biomarkers for NAFLD using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and develop a diagnostic model for disease prediction.

**Methods:**
We enrolled 3,733 visitors to St. Luke International Hospital, Center for Preventive Medicine (Tokyo, Japan) between October 2015 and September 2016, who met exclusion criteria for NAFLD diagnosis, such as daily alcohol intake (Men ≥30g, Women ≥20g), concurrent liver disease or malignancy, and medication for metabolic diseases. Fatty liver was diagnosed by ultrasonography. Metabolome analysis was performed on blood serum samples using the GCMS-TQ8040 (Shimadzu, Japan).

**Results:**
The mean age of the participants was 51.8 years, and 826 (22.1%) were diagnosed with NAFLD. Compared to the non-NAFLD group, 57.0% of the metabolites (65/114 investigated metabolites) were significantly increased in the NAFLD population. Glutamic acid (P = 6.4 x 10^-89 and AUC = 0.759) showed the strongest association, followed by 2-oxoglutaric acid and valine. These metabolites remained significantly associated with NAFLD after adjustment for sex, age, and BMI using logistic regression. Using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), we constructed a diagnostic model including multiple metabolites (n=70), achieving an AUC of 0.870.

**Discussion and Conclusions:**
We identified metabolites associated with NAFLD that were independent of obesity. A high-performance diagnostic model for NAFLD through the integration of metabolomics analysis and machine learning was developed, which may have potential for clinical application in the future.

**Title:** Curcumin Alleviates Palmitate-Induced Inflammation and Glycerolipid Accumulation in C2C12 Skeletal Muscle Cells

**Presenting Author:** Dean Ashley, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom

**Co-Authors:** McNally BD, Murfitt S, Middleton A, Sassano G, Russell P, Aleksic M, Griffin J

**Background:**
Increased plasma concentrations of palmitate in obese individuals are suggested to enhance inflammation, lipotoxicity, and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, including skeletal muscle. Upon treatment with palmitate, the expression of inflammatory cytokines Il6 and Tnfα was increased as measured by rtPCR, while co-treatment with curcumin ameliorated these increases. Published studies have shown that curcumin can increase AMPK activity in skeletal muscle of mice fed a high-fat diet, ameliorating inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insulin resistance. However, the mechanism underpinning these changes has not been fully elucidated. As AMPK is an important regulator of lipid metabolism, we applied mass spectrometry to assess curcumin-induced alterations in the lipid profile of C2C12 myotubes exposed to 750 µM palmitate.

**Methods:**
Lipids were extracted using a modified Bligh and Dyer method, and lipid changes were assessed using open profiling C18-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

**Results:**
Treatment with palmitate raised concentrations of triacylglycerides (TAGs), diacylglycerides (DAGs), ceramides, and phosphatidylcholine species. The elevated levels of TAGs and DAGs were reduced with curcumin co-treatment, while concentrations of other lipid species were unaffected.

**Discussion:**
These results suggest that the reduced inflammation and insulin resistance exerted by curcumin are driven by increased catabolism of DAGs and TAGs, alleviating the palmitate-induced DAG activation of protein kinase C, JNK, and IKK pathways.

**Title:** Metabolomics as a Diagnostic Tool in Inborn Errors of Metabolism

**Presenting Author:** Michel van Weeghel, Amsterdam UMC, Netherlands

**Co-Authors:** Mia L. Pras-Raves, Martin A. T. Vervaart, Angela C. M. Luyf, Lindsey Welling, Mendy Karssies, Sacha Ferdinandusse, Antoine H. C. van Kampen, Riekelt H. Houtkooper, Ronald J. A. Wanders, Annet M. Bosch, Hans R. Waterham, Frédéric M. Vaz

**Background:**
Metabolomics involves the (semi-)quantitative and qualitative measurement of metabolites in biological matrices and is used as an analytical tool for biomarker discovery in research but has not frequently been applied to diagnostics. Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are routinely identified by targeted analysis of intermediary metabolites. Recent developments in high-resolution mass spectrometry, tracer-based metabolomics, and ion mobility techniques open new avenues to perform (untargeted) metabolomics for the identification of new biomarkers in IEM.

**Methods:**
We investigated the metabolome profiles from a set of 120 plasma samples from patients with 10 known inborn errors of peroxisomal metabolism. We used reversed-phase, normal-phase, and HILIC chromatography followed by full-scan orbitrap-MS on the Q Exactive plus in positive and negative ionization mode and annotated over 200 polar metabolites and over 1200 lipid species.

**Results:**
We identified specific biomarkers for the different inborn errors of peroxisomal metabolism and discovered new potential biomarkers. Because this is a semi-targeted approach, identities of some of the newly found biomarkers remain to be characterized. Furthermore, we performed stable isotope tracer experiments on three classical and three variant (no illness at diagnosis by newborn screening, erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase activity 4-9%) galactosemia patients and were able to distinguish mild from severe patients (the galactosemia index), which ultimately could lead to personalized treatment of these patients.

**Conclusion:**
The ultimate goal is to use this type of metabolomics analysis for first-line screening of IEMs.

**Title:** Metabolic Signature Associated with Insulin Sensitivity Improvement Following a Weight Loss Intervention

**Presenting Author:** Jarlei Fiamoncini, University of São Paulo - School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Brazil

**Co-Authors:** Milena Rundle, E. Louise Thomas, Barbara Gelhaus, Ronny Scheundel, Alexander Haag, Christian Hoffmann, Guus Roeselers, Denise Sonntag, Jimmy D Bell, Gary Frost, Hannelore Daniel

**Background:**
Metagenomics and metabolomics analysis are allowing the exploration of the connection between intestinal microbiota and host metabolism. Within the NutriTech project, 72 healthy subjects (male and female, ± 60 y.o.) were enrolled in a weight loss intervention (20% dietary energy restriction for 12 weeks), losing on average 6.4% of their body weight. In some volunteers, weight loss was associated with an improvement in insulin sensitivity, while in others, only minor changes in insulin sensitivity were observed despite weight loss.

**Methods:**
Looking for metabolic signatures that could help understand these outcomes, two PLS-DA models were built: one using the results of body composition and metabolite profiling of plasma samples collected during an OGTT and a mixed meal test; the second using data from intestinal microbiota composition. Marker metabolites of both groups were identified, including urea, specific bile acids, amino acids, and acylcarnitines, as well as several discriminant bacterial species.

**Results:**
Individuals without improvement in insulin sensitivity following the weight loss displayed higher plasma concentrations of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (a taurine-conjugated bile acid), had higher proportions of Bilophila and other urease-positive bacteria within their microbiome, but lower concentrations of urea and deoxycholic acid. The differences in microbiota composition are in line with the differences in plasma urea and bile acids concentrations.

**Conclusion:**
This analysis brings new phenotypic information associated with differential weight loss and allows the generation of hypotheses. Further studies are warranted, and validation of the findings in larger cohorts is necessary.

**Title:** Batch Independent Screening of Inborn Errors of Metabolism with Untargeted Metabolomics

**Presenting Author:** Michiel Bongaerts, Erasmus Medical Centre, Netherlands

**Co-Authors:** Ramon Bonte, Serwet Demirdas, Henk Blom, George Ruijter

**Background:**
Untargeted metabolomics can be used for the screening of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM). However, most studies have used control samples from the same experimental run for determining Z-scores of metabolites, limiting the amount and matching (sex, age) of the controls with the patient of interest. We explored the use of controls originating from different experimental runs/batches to define a better reference population for a given patient.

**Methods:**
Six batches were independently processed and subsequently merged. In total, 195 controls and 33 patients were measured, including 20 different IEMs. We explored multiple normalization methods to correct for signal drift and batch effects. Internal standard-based normalization methods performed better than statistical-based methods. We developed a normalization method, Metchalizer, which uses a mixed-effect model and internal standards for normalization. This method showed the best performance on our data compared with other methods.

**Results:**
After normalization with Metchalizer, 56 out of 69 biomarkers for patients with known IEMs were detected by using a reference population from other batches. This study identified multiple age/sex-related metabolites using a regression model. The variance in control samples is determined by both biological and technical variance. The biological variance for a given metabolite might strongly depend on age and/or sex, and therefore, matching patient and reference is important when determining Z-scores. We show that using controls from other batches can solve this issue as long as batch effects can be corrected.

**Title:** Metabolomic Alterations in Hypocholesterolemic Drug Users

**Presenting Author:** Minako Matsumoto, Keio University, Japan

**Co-Authors:** Sei Harada, Miho Iida, Suzuka Kato, Ayako Kurihara, Ayano Takeuchi, Kazuyo Kuwabara, Daisuke Sugiyama, Tomonori Okamura, Toru Takebayashi

**Background:**
Although hypocholesterolemic drugs are the first-line therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention, the most highly used statins are known for their various adverse effects, such as muscle inflammation, liver damage, and hyperglycemia. This study sought to determine variations of plasma metabolite concentrations related to hypocholesterolemic drug intake using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry.

**Methods:**
All data and samples were collected from participants of the Tsuruoka Metabolomics Cohort Study conducted in Japan. Information on medical history, lifestyle, and medications was collected through a standardized, self-administered questionnaire. After excluding those with a history of cancer, stroke, and myocardial infarction, we selected participants on hypocholesterolemic drugs alone as drug users (n=385) and those with LDL-cholesterol 140 mg/dl or above but without any drug as controls (n=1143). Associations between drug intake and plasma metabolite concentrations were examined by linear regression. Analysis of covariance was conducted to examine the association between levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hypocholesterolemic drug-related metabolites.

**Results:**
Out of 115 polar metabolites analyzed, five were identified as hypocholesterolemic drug-related metabolites. These associations were independent of sex, age, systolic blood pressure, FPG, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, dietary energy, and liver function. Three out of five metabolites (betaine, threonine, and cystine) were included in the trans-sulfuration pathway. Cystine was also found to be associated with elevated levels of FPG, which may reflect the effect of statin intake on hyperglycemia.

**Conclusion:**
Alterations of plasma metabolite levels in the trans-sulfuration pathway were observed with hypocholesterolemic drug intake.

**Title:** Metabolomics Study on the Effect of Combination Treatment Between Pioglitazone and Piceatannol on Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Rats

**Presenting Author:** Shun Wan Chan, Technological and Higher Education Institute of Hong Kong, Hong Kong

**Co-Authors:** Shun-Wan Chan, Chi-On Chan, Tung-Ting Sham, Huan Zhang, Yam-Fung Ng, Daniel Kam-Wah Mok

**Background:**
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver disorders worldwide. Given the importance of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, insulin sensitizers have been broadly investigated in treating NAFLD. However, the long-term usage-related side effects of insulin sensitizers have limited their utility. Combination drug therapy utilizes more than one medication, but each agent is given at a dose much lower than the normal therapeutic dose, resulting in synergistic therapeutic outcomes.

**Methods:**
In this study, we used metabolomics approaches to investigate a novel drug therapy using pioglitazone (a commonly used insulin sensitizer) in combination with piceatannol, a natural analog of resveratrol, to treat NAFLD in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Our in vivo study clearly demonstrated that Sprague-Dawley rats fed with HFD for 4 weeks could establish NAFLD. Treatment with pioglitazone in combination with piceatannol significantly reduced the adverse effects induced by HFD, lowering the liver's lipid content and the total cholesterol level in serum.

**Results:**
The metabolomics profile of the combination drug therapy group was significantly different from that of the HFD group but was getting closer to that of the control group. Additionally, more than 20 metabolites were found as potential biomarkers, indicating that this combination drug therapy could effectively modulate lipid metabolism and result in improvements in NAFLD.

**Title:** In Vivo Metabolic Profiling in Brown and White Adipose Tissue Using Open Flow Microperfusion (OFM)

**Presenting Author:** Elmar Zügner, Joanneum Research Forschungsgesellschaft mbH, Austria

**Co-Authors:** Simon Schwingenschuh, Thomas Altendorfer-Kroath, Sonja Kainz, Yasemin Erdem, Günther Rauter, Petra Kotzbeck, Joanna Hummer, Thomas Birngruber, Christoph Magnes

**Background:**
One of the major challenges for the healthcare system is the increasing prevalence of obesity. Several therapeutic approaches to overcome obesity modify adipose tissue metabolism to induce sustained weight loss. However, how treatment effects are mediated on multiple metabolic pathways remains elusive. We present a novel method to investigate tissue-specific metabolism in brown and white adipose tissue (BAT, WAT) in rats.

**Methods:**
We performed open flow microperfusion (OFM) allowing collection of interstitial fluid of BAT and WAT, and subsequent metabolic profiling of the collected samples. Metabolic profiling was performed in OFM samples with volumes as small as 15 µl each. Analyzation was done using HILIC-HRMS (Vanquish UHPLC, QExactive mass spectrometer Thermo Fischer Scientific) in positive and negative electro spray ionisation mode with a gradient elution and a run time of 37 minutes. Metabolic profiling identified 141 metabolites, including lipids, fatty acids, or amino acids, classified into metabolites usable for multivariate (MVA) or univariate (UVA) data analysis. 94 MVA metabolites showed a median standard deviation of peak intensity in pooled quality control samples of 7.1%, low ppm, and no retention-time deviation, making them usable for principal component analysis (PCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA). UVA metabolites were only usable for ANOVA.

**Results:**
PCA showed a distinct signature for 2 metabolite classes in WAT and BAT samples. MVA and some UVA metabolites from these classes also showed statistically significant differences in the ANOVA. These results serve as a proof-of-concept to directly investigate adipose tissue metabolism in vivo.

**Title:** Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry-Based Approach to Evaluate Lipidomic Changes of Plasma in Yijin-Tang-Treated Obese Mice

**Presenting Author:** Jueun Lee, Korea Basic Science Institute, South Korea

**Co-Authors:** So Min Lee, Eunjung Kang, Hye-Lin Kim, Jeeyoun Jung, Geum-Sook Hwang

**Background:**
Obesity is one of the most widespread health problems and is characterized by aberrant lipid metabolism. The herbal remedy Yijin (Erchen)-tang (YJT) is widely used to treat obesity-related disorders. However, the change of lipid metabolism by YJT remains unknown.

**Methods:**
In this study, a liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS)-based approach was applied to investigate specific changes in lipid metabolism associated with the therapeutic effects of YJT-treated obese mice. C57BL/6N mice were fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFHC, 40% fat and 1% cholesterol) diet for 8 weeks and treated with YJT for an additional 6 weeks. We then performed untargeted lipidomic analysis of plasma using UPLC-QTOF MS coupled with multivariate statistical analysis.

**Results:**
Partial least squares-discriminant analysis score plots showed that YJT altered the lipid metabolic pattern of HFHC mice. In particular, ceramides and triglycerides with saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids were significantly changed by YJT, which were significantly associated with insulin resistance, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, and adipocytokine signaling pathway in pathway enrichment analysis. In addition, the changes in total WBC, CRP, and blood glucose, and correlation analysis between lipids and those clinical markers showed the effect of YJT treatment on ameliorating inflammation and improving insulin resistance.

**Conclusion:**
These data suggest that YJT ameliorates obesity-induced systemic inflammation and insulin resistance by regulating lipid metabolism, and demonstrate that lipidomic profiling is a useful method to investigate the therapeutic effects of herbal decoctions in traditional Korean and Chinese medicine.

**Title:** Anabolic Androgenic Steroids Induce Weight Loss in Male Wistar Rats in Relation to Free Fatty Acids in Plasma

**Presenting Author:** David Balgoma, Uppsala University, Sweden

**Co-Authors:** Sofia Zelleroth, Alfhild Grönbladh, Mathias Hallberg, Curt Pettersson, Mikael Hedeland

**Background:**
The abuse of anabolic androgenic steroids (AASs) in supratherapeutic doses is a source of public concern. Among other effects, AASs affect lipogenesis and lipolysis in different tissues. Lipidomics has the potential to unravel the mechanism of the effects of AASs in health and disease.

**Methods:**
Consequently, we treated Wistar rats every third day with vehicle, nandrolone decanoate, and testosterone undecanoate (supratherapeutic doses). The weight of the animals was measured every third day, and on day 18, the animals were euthanized, blood was collected, and plasma isolated. After extraction, the plasma lipidome was analyzed on an Acquity UPLC-Synapt G2S Q-ToF equipped with a BEH C18 column.

**Results:**
Free fatty acids showed a specific regulation in relation to the treatment with AASs. They increased in the treatment with nandrolone decanoate but did not change with testosterone undecanoate. Weight decreased with the treatment with nandrolone decanoate, but weight did not change with testosterone undecanoate. As free fatty acids in plasma are known to reflect the levels of triacylglyceride lipolysis in the adipose tissue, weight regulation is associated with the levels of free fatty acids in plasma. This effect might play a role in the effect of androgens in health and disease.

**Title:** Development of a New Diagnostic Tool for the Early Detection of Type 2 Diabetes (DeTecT2D)

**Presenting Author:** Rui Wang-Sattler, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Germany

**Co-Authors:** Stefan Brandmaier, Isobel D. Stewart, Andreas Lechner, Norbert Stefan, John Chambers, Peter Bergsten, Therese Koal, Christian Gieger, Jerzy Adamski, Annette Peters

**Background:**
According to the International Diabetes Federation, 1 in 2 people (212 million) with diabetes were undiagnosed. One reason for this problem is that the only sensitive assay for the early detection of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which is time-consuming and costly. The goal of the H2020 EIT Health-funded DeTecT2D consortium is to develop a new metabolomics-based assay for the sensitive detection of pre-diabetes and T2D from a single fasting blood sample.

**Methods:**
A set of 3 metabolite biomarkers for pre-diabetes and T2D was previously identified by members of the DeTecT2D consortium. Based on clinical studies, the consortium extended this set to 6 metabolites, which were further evaluated in two population-based human cohorts (n=9870). In the KORA and Fenland studies, the set of biomarkers showed comparable AUC values (83% and 94%) to detect individuals with pre-diabetes and newly diagnosed T2D, respectively. We further evaluated whether the set of 6 metabolites was capable of replacing the standard OGTT. Based on individuals with normal fasting glucose, we obtained AUC values of 74% and 77% for pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals in the KORA S4 study, respectively.

**Results:**
Although our extended set of biomarkers does not outperform the OGTT, it is highly predictive for newly diagnosed T2D. Thus, our set of biomarkers holds great promise for use as a routine screening tool for individuals with pre-diabetes and undiagnosed T2D.

**Title:** Mimicking Protein Restriction by Inhibiting SLC6A19 (B0AT1) — A Potential Target to Treat Metabolic Disorders

**Presenting Author:** Kiran Javed, Australian National University, Australia

**Co-Authors:** Stefan Broer

**Background:**
Recent studies have established that dietary protein restriction has beneficial impacts on metabolic health and promotes improved glucose homeostasis. SLC6A19 (B0AT1) is a neutral amino acid transporter that plays a key role in the absorption of amino acids in the small intestine and reabsorption in the kidney. Inhibiting SLC6A19 mimics the effects of protein restriction and may offer a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders.

**Methods:**
We used a genetic knockout model and pharmacological inhibitors to study the effects of SLC6A19 inhibition in mice. Metabolic parameters, including body weight, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity, were assessed. Additionally, we performed metabolomics analysis to identify changes in the metabolic profile.

**Results:**
SLC6A19 knockout mice and mice treated with SLC6A19 inhibitors exhibited reduced body weight, improved glucose tolerance, and enhanced insulin sensitivity. Metabolomics analysis revealed significant changes in amino acid and lipid metabolism, consistent with the metabolic benefits of protein restriction.

**Conclusion:**
Inhibiting SLC6A19 mimics the metabolic benefits of protein restriction and represents a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic disorders.
