### Impact of Ambient Background Noise

#### 6.7.4
In this section, we investigate the impact of ambient background noise on the performance of our fingerprinting technique. For this experiment, we consider scenarios where a crowd of people is using their smart devices, and we attempt to fingerprint these devices by capturing audio signals (specifically ringtones) from the surrounding environment. Table 16 highlights the four different scenarios we considered. To emulate such an environment, external speakers (two pieces) were placed between the smartphone and the microphone during recording. These external speakers continuously replayed the respective ambient noise in the background. We maintained a distance of two meters between the audio source and the recorder. The ambient background sounds were sourced from PacDV [2] and SoundJay [16]. We also computed the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio between the original ringtone and the different ambient background noises. The root-mean-square (RMS) value of the different background noises varied from approximately 13% (17.77 dB) to 18% (14.92 dB) of the RMS value of the ringtone under consideration. Table 16 presents our findings (values are reported as percentages). Even in the presence of various background noises, we achieved an F1-score of over 91%.

**Table 16: Impact of Ambient Background Noise**

| Shopping Mall        | 15.85    | 88.8     | 90.5      | 91.7      | 91.3      | 85.3       | 89.7       |
| Restaurant/Cafe      | 17.77    | 90.0     | 89.5      | 87.0      | 90.1      | 90.8       | 90.4       |
| City Park            | 15.43    | 95.1     | 92.5      | 95.2      | 94.5      | 93.3       | 90.7       |
| Airport Gate         | 14.92    | 94.1     | 93.3      | 94.2      | 91.6      | 94.6       | 93.9       |

### Varying Distance between Speaker and Recorder

#### 6.7.3
Next, we examine the impact of the distance between the audio source (i.e., smartphone) and the recorder (i.e., laptop/PC) on fingerprinting precision. For this experiment, we used a separate external microphone because the signal-capturing capacity of the microphone embedded inside a laptop degrades significantly as the distance increases. We employed the relatively inexpensive ($44.79) Audio-Technica ATR-6550 shotgun microphone for this experiment and varied the distance between the external microphone and the smartphone from 0.1 meter to 5 meters. Table 15 summarizes the F1-scores obtained as the distance between the smartphone and the microphone varies. As expected, the F1-score decreases with increasing distance. This is because the longer the distance between the smartphone and the microphone, the more challenging it becomes to capture the subtle deviations between audio samples. However, even up to a distance of two meters, we achieved an F1-score of 93%. This suggests that our device fingerprinting approach works effectively up to a certain distance using commercial microphones. Using specialized microphones, such as parabolic microphones, may further enhance performance.

### Discussion and Limitations

Our approach has several limitations. First, we conducted experiments with 52 devices from different vendors; a larger target device pool might lower accuracy. However, distinctions across different device types are more pronounced, and audio fingerprints can be used in conjunction with other techniques, like accelerometer fingerprinting [31], to better discriminate between devices. Secondly, most of the experiments took place in a lab setting. Nevertheless, we studied the impact of ambient background noise and found our approach to be applicable. Lastly, all the phones used in our experiments were not in mint condition, and some idiosyncrasies of individual microphones and speakers may have been due to uneven wear and tear. We believe this is likely to occur in real-world scenarios as well.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of fingerprinting smart devices through onboard acoustic components like microphones and speakers. Given that microphones and speakers are standard components in almost all smart devices today, this creates a significant privacy concern for users. To validate our approach, we collected fingerprints from 52 different smartphones, covering five different brands. Our studies show that it is possible to successfully fingerprint smartphones through microphones and speakers, not only in controlled environments but also in the presence of ambient noise. We believe our findings are important steps toward understanding the full consequences of fingerprinting smart devices through acoustic channels.

### Acknowledgment
