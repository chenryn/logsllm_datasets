**ATT&CK ID:** S0607  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** KillDisk

**Description:**
KillDisk is a destructive malware that overwrites the first sector of the Master Boot Record (MBR) with `0x00` bytes, rendering the system unbootable.[16] 

This action effectively corrupts the MBR, which is critical for the boot process, and can result in data loss and system failure.
