### Svchost Service Splitting

#### Overview
Svchost service splitting is a feature introduced in Windows 10 Creators Update (RS2) to address the issue of a single unhandled error in a shared host process affecting all services running within that process. This feature allows services to run in their own private hosting processes, thereby improving system stability and resource management.

#### How It Works
1. **Global Commit Limits:**
   - The Service Control Manager (SCM) reads three values from the registry representing the services' global commit limits (low, medium, and hard caps).
   - These values are used to send "low resources" messages if the system runs under low-memory conditions.

2. **Threshold Value:**
   - The SCM reads the `SvchostServiceSplitThresholdInKB` value from the registry key `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control`.
   - This value specifies the minimum amount of system physical memory (in KB) needed to enable Svchost service splitting. The default value is 3.5 GB on client systems and around 3.7 GB on server systems.

3. **Memory Comparison:**
   - The SCM compares the total system physical memory (obtained using the `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` API) with the threshold value.
   - If the total physical memory exceeds the threshold, Svchost service splitting is enabled.

4. **Service Start Behavior:**
   - When Svchost service splitting is active, the SCM modifies the behavior of starting the host Svchost process for shared services.
   - Even if a service is marked as sharable, it is started using its private hosting process, and its type is changed to `SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS`.

5. **Conditions for Service Splitting:**
   - Svchost service splitting is globally enabled.
   - The service is not marked as critical.
   - The service host process name is `Svchost.exe`.
   - Service splitting is not explicitly disabled for the service through the `SvcHostSplitDisable` registry value in the service control key.

#### Memory Management
- Memory manager technologies like Memory Compression and Combining help in saving system working set.
- Even though many new processes are created, the memory manager ensures that the physical pages of the hosting processes remain shared, minimizing resource consumption.

### Experiment: Playing with Svchost Service Splitting

1. **Check Current Svchost Processes:**
   - Open Task Manager and count the number of `svchost.exe` process instances.
   - Use PowerShell to get the count:
     ```powershell
     (get-process -Name "svchost" | measure).Count
     ```

2. **Disable Svchost Service Splitting:**
   - Open the Registry Editor and navigate to `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control`.
   - Set the `SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB` DWORD value to 0.
   - Restart the system and repeat the count to see the reduction in `svchost.exe` instances.

3. **Restore Default Behavior:**
   - Restore the previous value of `SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB` to re-enable Svchost service splitting.

### Service Tags

- **Purpose:**
  - Service tags help in accounting for CPU time and resource usage by specific services in a shared hosting process.
  - The SCM generates a unique index (service tag) for each service, stored in the `SubProcessTag` field of the thread environment block (TEB).

- **Usage:**
  - Tools like `Netstat.exe` and `ScTagQuery` use undocumented APIs to query service tags and map them to service names.
  - This helps in identifying runaway services consuming excessive CPU time.

### User Services

- **Overview:**
  - User services allow a service to run with the token of the currently logged-on user.
  - They can run in their own process or share a process with other services in the same user account.
  - User services are started during interactive logon and stopped when the user logs off.

- **Internal Support:**
  - The SCM supports additional type flags: `SERVICE_USER_SERVICE` (64) and `SERVICE_USERSERVICE_INSTANCE` (128).
  - The User Manager service (Usermgr.dll) calls the SCM to deliver the `WTS_SESSION_LOGON` session event.

### Experiment: Witnessing User Services

1. **Identify User Service Instance:**
   - Open the Services tool and identify a user service instance (e.g., Connected Device User Service_55d01).

2. **Find Hosting Process ID:**
   - Use the Registry Editor to find the Service DLL name under the Parameters subkey.
   - Use Process Explorer or Task Manager to find the PID of the hosting process.

3. **Kernel Debugger:**
   - Break into the kernel debugger and use the `!process` and `!token` commands to inspect the security attributes of the hosting process's token.
   - Confirm the presence of the `WIN://ScmUserService` security attribute.

### Packaged Services

- **Overview:**
  - Since Windows 10 Anniversary Update (RS1), the Service Control Manager has supported packaged services.
  - Further details on packaged services will be covered in subsequent sections.

This optimized text provides a clear, coherent, and professional overview of the different service accounts, Svchost service splitting, service tags, user services, and packaged services.
