- **Shoutcast, Icecast**
  - **Pros:**
    - Free MP3 streaming servers.
    - Runs on Linux.
  - **Cons:**
    - Vulnerable to past exploits.

## Simple Methods for Serving and Protecting Streaming Media
### Easy Ways to Serve Media
1. **Upload-and-Serve Method:**
   - Create a media file (e.g., Real, Windows, MP3, QuickTime).
   - Upload it to your server via SCP, FTP, etc.
   - Provide a download link on your webpage.
   - Control downloads using .htaccess or JavaScript.

2. **Basic Streaming Setup:**
   - Use batch files or text files to simulate streaming (e.g., RAM > RM, ASX > ASF, M3U > MP3).
   - Benefits:
     - Forces streaming instead of saving.
     - Adds a layer of obscurity for security.

### Techniques for Stealing Streaming Media
- **HTML Siphoning:**
  - View the page source and search for media types (e.g., RM, RAM, MPG, MP3, WAV, AVI, MOV).
  - Use tools like `wget` or `lynx –dump` to download the media.

- **Sniffing:**
  - Use advanced tools like `tcpdump` or `windump` to capture URLs hidden by JavaScript or SQL.

- **Media from Media Servers:**
  - Some companies use secure media servers, but there are still ways to bypass these protections.

### RealMedia Logs and Security
- **RealServer Logs:**
  - Best on Linux.
  - Log only on disconnect.
  - Use TCP for control and UDP for streaming.
  - Tools like Streambox VCR can fake a RealPlayer connection to capture media.

### Protecting MP3 Streaming
- **Embedded MP3s:**
  - Can help, but HTML siphoning remains a risk.
- **.htaccess Files:**
  - Limit user access.
- **Disk Writing and File Writing Plugins:**
  - Won’t work if properly restricted.

### Additional Security Measures
- **Watermarking and Logo Embossing:**
  - Add a unique identifier to your media.
- **Security through Obscurity:**
  - Sometimes effective, but not foolproof.

### Conclusion
When deciding to stream media, consider your security needs first. Determine whether users should have the right to save your content. Implement a combination of technical and administrative controls to protect your media.
