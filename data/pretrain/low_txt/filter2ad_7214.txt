**Title: Automotive Enhanced Vision Systems - Issues Arising from Placing Users in the Loop**

**Author: Thomas Seder**

**Conference: International Conference on Dependable Systems & Networks, Anchorage, Alaska, June 24-27, 2008**

**Second Keynote Address**

**Abstract:**

Enhanced Vision Systems (EVS) have proven to significantly improve pilot situational awareness and flight task performance, making them a well-established technology in the avionics industry. Similar technologies hold the potential to provide analogous benefits to everyday drivers, but Automotive EVS is still in its infancy for various reasons. This presentation will introduce a unique Automotive EVS system and review several concept applications. It will also address the issues that arise from user-system interaction, the distinctive characteristics of the automotive domain, and associated system requirements. The discussion will cover aspects such as system reliability, availability, user acceptability, adaptability, and the critical task of building user trust through the reliable and hierarchical management of information presented by the EVS.
