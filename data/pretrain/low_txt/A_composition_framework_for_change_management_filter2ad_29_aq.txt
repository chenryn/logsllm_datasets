### Closing

The Closing Process Phase focuses on transitioning the change management (OCM) effort to the organization’s operational environment. Training gaps are identified and addressed after the deployment of the solution.

### 1.1 Introduction
During the Closing Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner will formally close out the OCM effort alongside the project team. This includes the transition of ongoing communications to the end-users and stakeholders to the organization’s operational group and collecting lessons learned for future projects. At this time, the evaluation of end-user and stakeholder post-implementation training needs will be analyzed to gauge training effectiveness.

### OCM Lifecycle Management
The OCM Practitioner works closely with the Project Manager throughout the Closing Process Phase to ensure that final OCM documentation, closeout approvals, resource allocation, and other transition tasks occur in an orderly and timely fashion. This includes documenting lessons learned and supporting the completion of the Post-Implementation Evaluation Report (PIER).

### Communication
The OCM Practitioner transitions the project communication activities to the organization’s operational support group. OCM-related communications continue to be important after the solution deployment as they provide messages regarding any process or solution refinements, as well as ongoing training and support opportunities.

### Training
After the solution is deployed, the OCM Practitioner, working with training resources, evaluates the training program to determine if there is a need for any additional training or on-the-job support. Refresher courses for end users may be delivered to further enhance their knowledge, skills, and abilities.

Once all OCM-related Closing Process Phase activities have been completed, the OCM Practitioner will complete the OCM Closing Process Phase Checklist. Figure 1-2 shows the goals, inputs, activities, and outputs of the six knowledge areas that are active during the Closing Process Phase.

### 1.2 Recommended Practices
The following recommended practices will assist the OCM Practitioner in closing the project, including the transition from implementation to operational support and any additional training support that may be necessary. These recommended practices apply to all OCM knowledge areas.

- **Review recommended practices at the start of the process phase.**
- **Recognize Post-Deployment Ongoing OCM Needs:**
  - At the conclusion of the Executing Process Phase, new processes and technology solutions have been deployed. However, the Closing Process Phase has ongoing OCM-related needs. It is important to recognize these end-user and stakeholder communication and training needs, as these do not end at go-live.
- **Take Lessons Learned Seriously:**
  - There can be a tendency for project team members to feel that they are just going through the motions in providing lessons learned feedback. The OCM Practitioner should promote OCM lessons learned sessions or surveys as valuable opportunities to capture what went well and what could have been done more effectively.
- **Communications are Equally Important After Implementation:**
  - When end users and stakeholders begin using the new solution, there needs to be a clear channel of communication and a method to obtain pertinent information. New releases often address process and/or system changes, which need to be effectively communicated on a timely basis.
- **End Users and Stakeholders Need Access to Additional Training:**
  - While training is provided before implementation, end users and stakeholders often find that they need additional training or refresher training after working in the future state. The OCM Practitioner, working with training resources, may need to determine and address any additional training needs.
