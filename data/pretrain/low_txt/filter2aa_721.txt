## Important Notice
**Why You Shouldn't Do This and Why We Didn't Do It On the Air**

### FCC Regulations (Title 47 – Part 97)
**§ 97.113 Prohibited transmissions.**
(a) No amateur station shall transmit:
- Music using a phone emission except as specifically provided elsewhere in this section
- Communications intended to facilitate a criminal act
- Messages encoded for the purpose of obscuring their meaning, except as otherwise provided herein
- Obscene or indecent words or language
- False or deceptive messages, signals, or identification

## Project Background
### Final Warning Slide
- **Hackers + Drinks = Project**
- **WANC - We are not cryptographers**
- **We are not giving cryptographic advice**
- **You should talk to a cryptographer**
- **If you are a cryptographer, we welcome your input**

### Project Objective
We set out to demonstrate the feasibility (or infeasibility) of creating a:
- Low Infrastructure
- Long Range
- Covert
- Point to Point, Broadcast, or Mesh
- Short Message Protocol

Using existing consumer radio and computer equipment, leveraging a commonly used digital mode.

### Motivation
- Avoid censorship
- Avoid spying
- We believe you have the right to communicate without interference
- You COULD use our method to communicate, OR use similar techniques to create your own method

### Amateur Radio Expertise
- Many frequency bands reserved for amateur radio operators
- Voice chat, digital modes...
- Take a multiple-choice test to get licensed
- Reminder: The rules say you can't do what we're showing you...

### AirChat
- Anonymous communication by Lulzlabs
- Encrypted communication in plain sight
- Cool project with a different purpose
- Also breaks the rules

### Good Steganography / Good OPSEC
- Means hiding well in plain sight
- Invisible to normal users
- “Plausible deniability”
- Not this → More Like This
- NOT THIS!
- Guns == Good! Smartphones == BAD :)

### Ways to Hide
- Protocol features (headers, checksums, etc.)
- Timing or substitution
- Errors
- No “spurious emissions” (against the rules, obvious, very “visible”)

### Candidate Protocol Requirements
- Widespread common use
- Places to hide
- Relatively power efficient
- No special hardware or closed software required

### Popular Sound Card Digital Modes
- **RTTY**
  - In use on radio since at least the 1920s
  - Baudot code – 5-bit symbols with a stop and a shift – “mark and space”
  - Amateurs almost always use a 45 baud version with 170 Hz carrier shift
  - Limited character set

- **PSK31**
  - Phase shift keying 31 baud
  - Developed by Peter Martinez G3PLX in 1998
  - VERY tight protocol - “Varicode”

- **JT65**
  - Developed by Joe Taylor – K1JT – 2005
  - Original paper: “The JT65 Communications Protocol”
  - Designed for Earth-Moon-Earth communications
  - Now widely used for skywave contacts
  - Very power efficient
  - Structured communication, very low data rate
  - Open source implementation

### JT65 Conversations
- **Common HF Ham Frequencies:**
  - 20m: 14.076 MHz
  - 15m: 21.076 MHz
  - 10m: 28.076 MHz
  - Upper Side Band

### JT65 Technical Details
- **User Message**
  - Source Encoding
  - FEC
  - Matrix Interleaving
  - Gray Coding
  - Audio
- **JT65 “packet” sliced into 126 .372s intervals – 47.8s**
- **1270.5 Hz sync tone - “pseudo-random synchronization vector”**
- **Symbols - 1270.5 + 2.6917(N+2)m Hz**
  - N is the integral symbol value, 0 ≤ N ≤ 63
  - m assumes the values 1, 2, and 4 for JT65 sub-modes A, B, and C

### Hiding in Reed Solomon Codes
- **Exploit error correction!**
- **Easy/PoC Mode:** Shove in some errors... :) (static “key”)
- **Medium mode:** Shove in errors, add some random cover
- **Hard Mode:** Encrypt and pack message, add FEC
- **Prior Work:** Hanzlik, Peter “Steganography in Reed-Solomon Codes”, 2011

### Encoding Steganography (Basic)
- **Steg: DEF CON 22**
- **Source Encoding:**
- **FEC: Can tolerate 4 errors**

### Hiding Steganography
- **Key: pdogg thedukezip**
- **Generate 20 'locations' based on SHA512**
- **Injecting Errors:**
  - **JT65: KB2BBC KA1AAB DD44**
  - **Steg: DEF CON 22**
  - **Key: pdogg thedukezip**

### Encryption
- **We have 12 * 6 = 72 bits to play with**
- **We need 8-bit bytes...**
- **Well that gives us exactly 9 bytes**

### Packing Function
- **Status: 1 byte**
- **Data: 8 bytes**
- **Steganography: 12 6-bit symbols**

### Status Byte
- **Track how many total packets in message**
- **Flags for first/last packet**
- **Track size for stream ciphers**

### Status Byte – Stream Cipher
- **First packet: (0x80) | (# of total packets)**
- **Middle packets: (0x40) | (# of bytes in packet) | Packet Number**
- **Last packet: (0x40) | (# of bytes in packet) | Packet Number**
- **Max size: 64 packets (512 bytes)**

### Status Byte – Block Cipher
- **First packet: (0x80) | (# of total packets)**
- **Other packets: Packet Number**
- **Max size: 128 packets (1024 bytes)**

### Hiding the Status Byte
- **Perform Bit Swap**
- **Steganography traffic was trivial to pick out of normal traffic because of this byte :(**

### Tool Demo
- **“Feed Reader” RasPi Demo...**

### Analysis/Steganalysis
- **Defined set of legitimate JT65 packets**
- **“Known Cover Attack”**
- **Receive packet → Decode → Encode**
- **Demodulator provides “probability” or confidence**
- **Theory: Packets suspected to contain steganography can be easily distinguished by some quantitative measure**

### Known Cover
- **JT65: KB2BBC KA1AAB DD44**
- **Steg: DEF CON 22**
- **Key: pdogg thedukezip**

### Analysis Module
- **Finding Steganography is Easy**
- **Finding Steganography is Hard**
- **Interesting Patterns (and a warning)**
- **Distance: Considering we cannot SEND these packets, let's pretend we received them (<= 7 errors). How far away were the senders?**

### Effectiveness as a World Wide Short Message Protocol
- **How to get it? Oh yeah, it's on your conference DVD too... Available today!**

### Vulnerabilities / Known Limitations
- **Analysis and Detection: As discussed / other methods**
- **Transmitter location (foxhunting): Well studied problem/game by amateurs and TLAs**
- **FCC/DEA/NSA - SANDKEY(1)**
- **Message Forgery**
- **Storage / long-term cryptographic analysis**

### Conclusions
- **Protocols and methods such as those presented can, in theory, provide a platform for short message communications with desirable properties:**
  - Low infrastructure
  - Long distance
  - Covert
  - Plausibly deniable
- **Potential for analysis and detection, especially for well-equipped adversaries**

### Next Steps / Further Areas of Study
- **Continued Detection / Counter Detection Work**
- **Cryptographic Improvements**
- **Enhanced amateur applications**
- **Useful protocols and networks**
