# Baseband-Assisted Enrollment Scheme

To address the limitations of traditional baseband operations, such as handling phone calls, an enhanced baseband OS is employed to achieve secure enrollment. This scheme leverages the enhanced baseband OS to securely manage initialization secrets and other sensitive data.

## Enrollment Using Initialization Secrets

Figure 11 illustrates the challenges in user enrollment when using initialization secrets. Any communication channel to the secure world can be intercepted by the mobile OS in the normal world, including the baseband OS, user interface, or other interfaces like NFC or Bluetooth. For instance, the baseband OS cannot reliably pass the initialization secret received via SMS to the application processor because it cannot determine whether the processor is in the normal world or the secure world.

## Alternative Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)

In addition to ARM TrustZone, SIM cards are widely available TEEs on smartphones. SIM cards can store secrets and execute small pieces of code (SIM applications) in isolation from the mobile OS. However, this approach has two main drawbacks:

1. **Provisioning Complexity**: Deploying SIM applications requires negotiation with network operators, which can be cumbersome for global applications.
2. **Peripheral Access**: Current architectures do not allow SIM cards direct access to device peripherals like GPS units. The SIM card must rely on the application processor to provide location data, raising concerns about the integrity of this information.

Some recent device configurations support a dedicated connection between the SIM card and the NFC unit, but extending this to other peripherals, such as the GPS, would require costly hardware changes.

SD cards can also serve as TEEs, running code in isolation from the mobile OS and storing credentials securely. However, SD cards face similar issues as SIM cards regarding direct access to peripherals and remote provisioning of applications.

### Secure Payments with Location Data

- **[3]**: Proposes using phone location to mitigate fraud in payments at points of sale. This solution requires modifications to the GSM infrastructure, point-of-sale systems, and user experience. It does not account for a compromised mobile OS or enrollment.
- **MasterCard [2]**: Uses smartphone location for fraud detection in payments but does not address mobile OS compromise, enrollment, or migration.

### Secure Payments with Other Approaches

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Various works leverage hardware and software tokens, biometric scanners, and user-remembered passwords to secure online payments.
- **NFC-Enabled POS Terminals**: Financial institutions are deploying systems that use modern smartphones to replace traditional payment cards, but these solutions often require significant hardware upgrades at merchants.

### Secure Enrollment

- **Trusted Platforms [56]** and **TEEs on Mobile Devices [11]**: Secure enrollment is a challenging research problem. Both deployed systems and academic work have often overlooked it or assumed a non-compromised OS during enrollment.

### Trusted Sensors

- **Saroiu and Wolman [9]**: Propose virtualization to handle sensor readings and provide signed measurements to applications in guest VMs.
- **Liu et al. [10]**: Build on Credo [60] and TrustZone to propose software abstractions for trusted sensor services, focusing on local processing and differential privacy.
- **Plug-n-Trust [62]**: Provides a system for mHealth scenarios, leveraging a smart card in the microSD slot to create a trusted computing environment for sensor data.
- **YouProve [57]**: Addresses scenarios where sensor readings must be modified by local applications, ensuring the modified data preserves the original meaning.

Previous work on trusted sensors primarily focuses on designing trusted computing environments to sign sensor readings but does not address secure deployment aspects like enrollment and device migration. Our work is the first to propose a complete and deployable solution for on-smartphone trusted sensor measurements.

## Conclusion

This paper proposes a practical solution for adding security to location-based second-factor authentication mechanisms for payments at points of sale. We identified the necessary requirements for a deployable solution, including no changes to the user experience or deployed infrastructure. We proposed two novel enrollment schemes that enable secure enrollment and convenient device migration despite a compromised OS. Prototype implementations demonstrate the feasibility of our solution, with minimal delays and software changes required.
