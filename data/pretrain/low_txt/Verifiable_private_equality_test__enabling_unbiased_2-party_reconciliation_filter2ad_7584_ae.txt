### Performance Evaluation

The evaluation was conducted using 1024-bit moduli. The size of the ordered sets ranged from 10 to 200, increasing in steps of 10, with the input sets for both parties being disjoint to simulate worst-case behavior. For each set size, the runtime was averaged over 10 randomly generated sets.

As predicted and shown in [38, 36], all protocols exhibited quadratic behavior in the worst-case scenario. It is evident that the efficient DT10 PSI enables the construction of an efficient PROS protocol in the semi-honest model. Compared to DT10, our protocol, which provides security in the malicious model, exhibits an approximate overhead factor of 5.6. It is important to note that the requirement to perform each comparison twice to ensure mutual agreement already introduces an overhead factor of two. In conclusion, VPET facilitates the efficient construction of mutual higher-level protocols in the malicious model.

### Average-Case Performance

For our performance tests, we defined the average-case input as both parties having a fraction of set elements in common, with these common elements positioned randomly within the ordered sets. The ordered sets for both parties were generated such that they had exactly 5% of their elements in common. To obtain the results in Figure 10, the set size was varied from 20 to 420 in steps of 20. For each set size, the runtime was averaged over 100 randomly generated sets. Similar to the results in [36], the average case shows linear complexity. Compared to the worst-case, the runtime for all three PROS protocols is significantly reduced. As expected, the overhead factor of our construction compared to the DT10-based variant remains at approximately 5.6.

### Related Work

The first solution for Private Set Intersection (PSI) was proposed by Freedman et al., based on oblivious polynomial evaluation and homomorphic encryption [23]. This protocol provided security in the presence of semi-honest adversaries. It was later improved to provide security against malicious adversaries by several authors [12, 17, 29].

A different approach, resulting in more efficient protocols than those based on oblivious polynomial evaluation, is the use of Oblivious Pseudo-Random Function (OPRF) evaluation. The applicability of OPRF to the PSI problem was first suggested in [24]. Hazay and Lindell introduced efficient protocols, one with security in the presence of covert adversaries and another with security against malicious servers and semi-honest clients [27]. More recently, the OPRF approach was extended to exhibit active security in the common reference string model [30]. A similar idea based on an unpredictable function was proposed in [31].

Recently, De Cristofaro et al. presented a novel approach for PSI based on the comparison of blinded values [20, 19]. Their solution has linear complexity and includes protocols with security in both the semi-honest and malicious models. The blinding technique used in [19] is similar to the one used in our construction of the VPET protocol. However, their approach does not involve commitments and therefore does not enable proofs about the correct usage of inputs.

Similarly, various protocols providing different security guarantees have been proposed for Privacy-Preserving Element Testing (PET). Fagin et al. surveyed multiple techniques that can be used to determine whether two people are thinking about the same person [21]. In [43], Naor et al. presented a solution for PET using oblivious polynomial evaluation based on oblivious transfer. Boudot et al. designed a fair, i.e., mutual, solution with security under the discrete logarithm assumption [7]. More recently, Damgård et al. proposed a protocol based on a bit-decomposition scheme [18], which was later improved by Nishide et al. [45]. In [32], Murat et al. utilized threshold homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs to construct a PET protocol with security in the malicious model.

Finally, Lipmaa et al. proposed a verifiable homomorphic oblivious transfer protocol that is sender-private [34]. Their protocol allows a sender to commit to all elements in its database, which can then be related to other values used in the computation.

### Future Work

Future work includes enhancing VPET to enable arbitrary comparisons beyond equality tests. Additionally, we plan to extend our new VPET and PROS protocols to the multi-party setting.
