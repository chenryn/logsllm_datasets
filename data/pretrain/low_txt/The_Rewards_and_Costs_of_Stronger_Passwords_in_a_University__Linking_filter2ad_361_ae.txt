### 6.1 Policy Interventions

One key takeaway from this study is that the impact of a policy intervention should not be evaluated solely based on immediate improvements or lack thereof. Other studies, particularly laboratory-based ones, should measure the effects of security policies over meaningful intervals and for extended periods, as this would ideally be an ongoing process.

When designing new interventions, practitioners must consider how to effectively measure the effectiveness of the changes and their impact on users. After deploying an intervention, continuous monitoring and calibration may be necessary to reduce problems and encourage secure behavior. Dynamic policies that adapt to user behavior are not yet a common capability but could significantly enhance security.

Our findings indicate that users generally change their passwords in response to expiration warnings and reminders. However, warning users too early can effectively reduce the password's lifetime, which may confuse the purpose and intended function of password expiration. Additionally, some of the costs associated with password resets can be mitigated by allowing expired passwords to be changed rather than forcing a reset procedure.

Regarding our findings on password resets and voluntary password changes, a longer password lifetime is not necessarily the optimal reward. This opens up avenues for further research to find the most secure and practical defenses. In an ideal scenario, we envision a policy that links password expiration to password strength, only enforcing expiration if the weakest acceptable password is below the 10^6 guesses threshold identified by Florêncio et al. [23]. Passwords would then expire based on their expected online guessing resistance; stronger passwords should not unconditionally expire.

### Acknowledgements

We would like to thank our university, especially Tom Crummey, Tim Purkiss, and Noshir Homawala, for providing the opportunity to study this novel policy. Albesë Demjaha, Julienne Park, and Nissy Sombatruang contributed to the collection and initial analysis of user interviews. We also extend our thanks to Steven Murdoch and Sebastian Meiser for their feedback on early versions of this paper. Special thanks go to the USENIX Security review committee, and Lujo Bauer in particular.
