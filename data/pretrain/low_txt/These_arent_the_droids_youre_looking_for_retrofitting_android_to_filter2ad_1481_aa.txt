**Abstract:**
We present two privacy controls for Android smartphones that allow users to run applications with extensive permission requirements while safeguarding their private data. These controls include:
1. Substituting shadow data in place of sensitive information.
2. Blocking network transmissions containing data intended for on-device use only.

We retrofitted the Android operating system to implement these controls without modifying the applications. A key challenge is that these controls might cause side effects that interfere with desired functionality. To assess these side effects, we developed an automated testing methodology that records and compares screenshots of application executions with and without privacy controls. We evaluated our controls on 50 popular and permission-hungry applications from the Android Market. Our results show that 66% of the tested applications could operate effectively with reduced permissions and no side effects. The remaining 34% required access to sensitive data to provide desired functionality, presenting a trade-off between privacy and functionality.

**1. Introduction**
When installing an application on the Android platform, users face an ultimatum: grant all requested permissions or abandon the installation. Even if a user consents to an application accessing sensitive data, the application may misuse this data by exfiltrating it off the device. This has led to an ecosystem where privacy-invasive applications are common, drawing attention from U.S. federal prosecutors.

We developed AppFence, a system that retrofits the Android OS to impose privacy controls on existing applications. AppFence allows users to withhold data from applications that demand unnecessary information and block communications that would exfiltrate required data off the device.

For example, if an application demands a user's contacts, AppFence can substitute an empty or fictional contact list. Similarly, if an application requests the unique device ID (IMEI), AppFence can provide a hashed version, preventing cross-application profiling. However, shadowing can break functionality that requires accurate data. To address this, we also introduce exfiltration blocking, which extends the TaintDroid information-flow tracking system to prevent the transmission of sensitive data.

In this paper, we first analyze how 110 popular, permission-hungry applications use private information. We then design and evaluate two privacy controls: shadowing and exfiltration blocking. We develop a novel testing methodology to detect side effects by comparing application screenshots. Our evaluation shows that combining these controls can eliminate side effects in 66% of the tested applications, except where there is a direct conflict between functionality and privacy.

**Contributions:**
1. Extensive analysis of information exposure by Android applications, including types of information, forms of exposure, and patterns of data sent to advertising and analytics servers.
2. Two privacy controls for reducing sensitive data exposure, shown to be effective in 66% of 50 tested applications without side effects.
3. A novel testing methodology combining automated GUI testing and visual highlighting to detect side effects.

**2. Privacy Risks on Android**
To inform the design of our privacy controls, we analyzed 1100 popular free Android applications. We identified 11 permissions that applications request to access sensitive data, such as location, phone state, contacts, and unique device IDs. We found that 55% of the applications require access to at least one of these resources and the Internet, posing a risk of unwanted data disclosure.

**2.1 Application Selection**
We used three sets of applications: 1100 popular free applications, 110 for deeper analysis, and 50 for in-depth experiments. The 1100 applications were sampled from the 50 most popular in each of 22 categories. From these, we selected 110 applications, prioritizing those with third-party advertising and analytics (A&A) packages. For in-depth experiments, we further subsampled 50 applications, excluding those that did not transmit sensitive data and those requiring multiple devices for testing.

**2.2 Sources of Sensitive Information**
We identified 11 permissions leading to the disclosure of 12 types of sensitive information. Table 1 shows the prevalence of these permissions among the 1100 applications. Over half of the applications (55%) require access to at least one sensitive resource and the Internet.

**2.3 Misappropriation**
Previous research has shown that some Android applications exploit user data for unexpected purposes. For example, Enck et al. found that 50% of 30 analyzed applications shared users' locations with advertisement servers. Similar issues have been observed on other platforms, such as the iPhone, where unique device IDs are often transmitted for cross-application profiling.

**2.4 A Profile of the Profilers**
We examined the 1100 applications to identify third-party A&A libraries. Using the Android apktool, we found eight commonly used A&A packages, with AdMob being the most prevalent, followed by Google Ads. Table 2 shows the prevalence of these packages among the 1100 applications and a subset of 605 applications that demand access to sensitive data and the Internet.
