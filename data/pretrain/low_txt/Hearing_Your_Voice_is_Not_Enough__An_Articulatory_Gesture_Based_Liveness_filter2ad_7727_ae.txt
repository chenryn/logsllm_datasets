### Acoustic Feature-Based Methods for Attack Detection

Acoustic feature-based methods for attack detection are widely applicable but exhibit limited effectiveness [14, 21, 45, 49, 52]. Commercial voice authentication systems, such as VoiceVault and Nuance, primarily rely on challenge-response methods to detect replay attacks. These methods, however, require explicit user cooperation in addition to the standard voice authentication process, which can be cumbersome.

Recent smartphone-based solutions have been proposed, but they often require users to hold or move the phone in specific ways. For example, Chen et al. [17] introduced a system that measures the magnetic fields emitted from loudspeakers to differentiate between live users and recordings. This method, however, requires users to rotate their smartphones around their heads while speaking a passphrase. Another approach, VoiceLive [55], uses time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) changes between the two microphones of a smartphone to pinpoint the sound's origin within a live user's vocal tract. While effective, this method necessitates holding the phone in front of the user's mouth, which deviates from the typical behavior of holding the phone to the ear.

In contrast, our system, VoiceGesture, is designed to be transparent to users and works regardless of whether the phone is held to the ear or in front of the mouth. Additionally, VoiceGesture is less susceptible to environmental noise because it actively emits high-frequency sound waves, which can be easily distinguished from background noise, rather than passively listening to voices mixed with ambient sounds.

### Speech Synthesis Attacks

Speech synthesis attacks assume that an attacker can synthesize the target's voice using speech synthesis techniques. De Leon et al. [18] proposed a relative phase shift feature for GMM-UBM or SVM-based speaker verification systems, which can lower the false acceptance rate (FAR) to 2.5%. Wu et al. [51] evaluated state-of-the-art systems against speech synthesis attacks, achieving an overall average equal error rate (EER) of less than 1.5%.

Leow et al. [33] utilized concatenation artifacts on spectrograms to detect unit-selection-based synthesized speech attacks, achieving an EER of 15.2% for 16,000 Hz utterances. Adobe's recent work, VoCo [8], allows users to edit text and synthesize corresponding speeches with just 20 minutes of voice samples. Although not yet evaluated as a replay attack, VoCo poses a significant potential threat to voice authentication systems.

### Voice Conversion Attacks

Voice conversion attacks involve the attacker imitating the victim's voice through voice conversion or manipulation using existing voice samples. Conducting voice conversion requires expertise or specialized equipment but no human effort. Kinnunen et al. [23] found that text-independent speaker verification systems are vulnerable to voice conversion attacks using telephone speech. Kons et al. [28] evaluated several common speaker verification systems, including I-vector, GMM-NAP, and HMM-NAP, under voice conversion attacks, reporting a fourfold increase in EER, with the FAR of the HMM-NAP system increasing from 1% to 36%.

Wu et al. [50] developed an authentication system with a PLDA component that defends against voice conversion attacks with a 1.71% FAR. Alegre et al. [13] used PLDA and FA technologies to achieve a FAR of 1.6%. Sizov et al. [42] proposed a general countermeasure based on i-vectors and PLDA, claiming it could reduce EER to as low as 0.54%.

### Impersonation Attacks

Impersonation attacks differ from other types of attacks in that they do not require professional devices; instead, they rely on mimicking the target's voice. Compared to other attacks, impersonation attacks are less accessible and pose a lower risk to authentication systems. Wu et al. [48] suggest that impersonators may be able to mimic the fundamental frequency (F0) pattern and speaking rates of victims but struggle to fake spectral characteristics like formants. Therefore, impersonation attacks may deceive human listeners but not authentication systems. Recent work has shown that state-of-the-art speaker models, such as i-vector models [20] and GMM-UBM [16], can effectively mitigate impersonation attacks. Even with professional mimicry artists or linguists, common speaker authentication systems maintain considerable effectiveness [19, 37].

### Conclusions

In this paper, we developed VoiceGesture, a voice liveness detection system that requires only a speaker and a microphone, both commonly available on smartphones. Our system is practical as it does not require any additional cumbersome operations beyond the conventional voice authentication process. Once integrated with a voice authentication system, liveness detection is transparent to the users. VoiceGesture performs liveness detection by extracting features from the Doppler shifts caused by articulatory gestures when a user speaks a passphrase. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our system under various conditions, such as different phone types, placements, and sampling rates. Overall, VoiceGesture achieves over 99% accuracy with an EER of around 1%.
