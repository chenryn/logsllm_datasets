# Azure Data Explorer Clusters Insights

Azure Data Explorer Clusters Insights offers a unified and detailed view of your clusters' performance, operations, usage, and failures. It includes:

- **At-scale perspective**: A high-level view of key metrics to track query, ingestion, and export performance.
- **Drill-down analysis**: Detailed analysis of specific Azure Data Explorer clusters.
- **Customization**: Tailor the metrics, set thresholds, and save custom workbooks.

This article will guide you through the process of onboarding and using Azure Data Explorer Clusters Insights effectively.

## View from Azure Monitor (At-scale Perspective)

From Azure Monitor, you can monitor the primary performance metrics of your clusters, including queries, ingestion, and export operations across multiple subscriptions. This helps in identifying performance issues.

### Steps to View Cluster Performance Across Subscriptions

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Select **Monitor** from the left pane.
3. In the **Insights Hub** section, select **Azure Data Explorer Clusters**.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-explorer-insights/insights-hub.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selections for viewing the performance of Azure Data Explorer clusters." lightbox="media/data-explorer-insights/insights-hub.png":::

### Subscription Overview Tab

The **Overview** tab displays interactive metrics for Azure Data Explorer clusters within the selected subscription. You can filter results based on:

- **Subscriptions**: Only those with Azure Data Explorer clusters are listed.
- **Azure Data Explorer clusters**: Up to five clusters are pre-selected. Selecting all or multiple clusters returns up to 200 clusters.
- **Time Range**: By default, the last 24 hours of data is shown.

The counter tile shows the total number of Azure Data Explorer clusters and the number selected. Metrics such as **Keep alive**, **CPU**, **Ingestion Utilization**, and **Cache Utilization** are color-coded; orange indicates unsustainable values.

For more details on each metric, refer to the [Azure Data Explorer metrics documentation](./using-metrics.md#cluster-metrics).

### Query Performance Tab

The **Query Performance** tab displays query duration, concurrent queries, and throttled queries.

### Ingestion Performance Tab

The **Ingestion Performance** tab shows ingestion latency, succeeded and failed ingestion results, ingestion volume, and events processed for event hubs and IoT hubs.

### Streaming Ingest Performance Tab

The **Streaming Ingest Performance** tab provides information on average data rate, average duration, and request rate.

### Export Performance Tab

The **Export Performance** tab provides details on exported records, lateness, pending count, and utilization percentage for continuous export operations.

## View from an Azure Data Explorer Cluster Resource (Drill-down Analysis)

To access Azure Data Explorer Clusters Insights directly from an Azure Data Explorer cluster:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Azure Data Explorer Clusters**.
2. Choose a cluster from the list and select **Insights** in the monitoring section.

You can also access these views by selecting the resource name of an Azure Data Explorer cluster from within the Azure Monitor Insights view.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Data Explorer Clusters Insights combines logs and metrics for global monitoring. Enabling diagnostic logging for your Azure Data Explorer cluster and sending logs to a Log Analytics workspace is required. Enable the following diagnostic logs: **Command**, **Query**, **SucceededIngestion**, **FailedIngestion**, **IngestionBatching**, **TableDetails**, and **TableUsageStatistics**. (Enabling **SucceededIngestion** logs might be costly. Enable them only if necessary.)

:::image type="content" source="media/data-explorer-insights/enable-logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the button for configuring logs for monitoring.":::

### Overview Tab

The **Overview** tab provides:

- Metrics tiles for quick health assessment.
- Summary of active [Azure Advisor recommendations](./azure-advisor.md) and [resource health](./monitor-with-resource-health.md) status.
- Charts showing top CPU and memory consumers and unique users over time.

### Key Metrics Tab

The **Key Metrics** tab offers a unified view of cluster metrics grouped into general, query-related, ingestion-related, and streaming ingestion-related metrics.

### Usage Tab

The **Usage** tab allows you to analyze the performance of commands and queries. You can:

- Identify workload groups, users, and applications with the most queries or highest CPU and memory consumption.
- Detect top workload groups, users, and applications by failed queries.
- Compare recent changes in the number of queries to historical averages.
- Analyze trends and peaks in queries, memory, and CPU consumption.

The **Usage** tab includes user-performed actions but excludes internal cluster operations.

### Tables Tab

The **Tables** tab shows the latest and historical properties of tables in the cluster, including space consumption and growth history.

### Cache Tab

The **Cache** tab allows you to analyze query lookback window patterns and compare them to the configured cache policy. You can identify frequently queried tables and adjust the cache policy accordingly.

Cache policy recommendations are available in Azure Advisor. These recommendations are based on actual queries' lookback window in the past 30 days and an unoptimized cache policy for at least 95 percent of the queries.

### Cluster Boundaries Tab

The **Cluster Boundaries** tab displays CPU, ingestion, and cache utilization, scored as **Low**, **Medium**, or **High**. These metrics help in deciding the optimal SKU and instance count for your cluster.

### Ingestion Tab (Preview)

The **Ingestion** tab monitors queued ingestion operations, providing details on ingestion results, errors, data volume, latency, and batching process.

## Pin to an Azure Dashboard

You can pin any metric section to an Azure dashboard by selecting the pushpin icon at the upper right of the section.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-explorer-insights/pin.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the pin to Azure dashboard icon selected.":::

## Customize Azure Data Explorer Clusters Insights

You can customize the workbook to meet your data analytics needs:

- Scope the workbook to specific subscriptions or clusters.
- Modify metrics and thresholds.
- Change color coding.

Start customizations by selecting the **Customize** button on the top toolbar.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-explorer-insights/customize.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Customize workbook button.":::

Customizations are saved to a custom workbook to prevent overwriting the default configuration. Workbooks are saved within a resource group, either in the **My Reports** section (private) or **Shared Reports** section (accessible to everyone with resource group access).

## Troubleshooting

For general troubleshooting guidance, see [Troubleshooting workbook-based insights](/azure/azure-monitor/insights/troubleshoot-workbooks).

### Why Don't I See All My Subscriptions in the Subscription Picker?

Only subscriptions containing Azure Data Explorer clusters are displayed. Select a subscription filter under **Directory + subscription** in the Azure portal.

:::image type="content" source="/azure/azure-monitor/insights/media/key-vaults-insights-overview/Subscriptions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting a subscription filter.":::

### Why Don't I See Any Data for My Azure Data Explorer Cluster Under the Usage, Tables, or Cache Section?

Ensure that diagnostic logs are enabled for your Azure Data Explorer cluster and sent to a Log Analytics workspace. Enable the following logs: **Command**, **Query**, **TableDetails**, and **TableUsageStatistics**.

### I've Already Enabled Logs for My Azure Data Explorer Cluster. Why Am I Still Unable to See My Data Under Commands and Queries?

Diagnostic logs do not work retroactively. Data will start appearing after actions are taken in Azure Data Explorer, which may take several hours to a day, depending on cluster activity.
