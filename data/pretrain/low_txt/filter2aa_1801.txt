- Data stored in Toolbox
- Firmware changes
- Shunt modification
- Upgrade process
- Failure and lessons learned
- Next steps

## Model S Architecture
- **Central Information Display (CID):** Nvidia Tegra-based
- **Gateway:** A security component that stores vehicle configuration and sits between various CAN buses and the CID
- **Powertrain (PT) CAN bus:** Contains the BMS, drive units, charging, thermal control, and other powertrain-related controllers
  - Runs at 500 kBit/sec
  - Standard vehicle CAN bus (differential signaling, 11-bit arb IDs, etc.)
  - Supports UDS standard

## BMS Overview
- **Main Microprocessor:** TI TMS320C2809
- **Hardware Backup:** Altera CPLD for TMS320
- **Current Shunt with STM8:** Measures current from the battery
- **Precharge Resistor:** Prevents inrush current damage
- **BMB Boards on Each Battery Pack:** Include bleed resistors to balance packs
- **Firmware Changes:** Primarily on the TMS320
- **Shunt Modifications:** Some settings are changed, and a small physical modification is made
- **Ongoing Project:** Full reversing of all components; assistance is welcome in areas where skills are lacking

## Ludicrous History
- **P85D Announcement:** October 10, 2014
- **Ludicrous Announcement:** July 17, 2015
- **Upgrade Cost:** $10K for new buyers, $5K for existing P85D owners
- **Upgrade Components:** New contactors and pyro fuse
- **Performance Battery Packs:** Many come standard with new components and are "ludicrous capable"
- **All 100kWh Performance Battery Packs:** Ludicrous capable
- **Activation:** Add "performanceaddon 1" to the `internal.dat` file on the gateway

## Donor Vehicle Upgrade
- **Pack Dropped**
- **Fuse and Contactor Bay**
- **Shunt and Contactor Close Up**

## Firmware Analysis
- **Python and Diagnostic Tool:** Tesla's Toolbox, runs on Windows, uses encrypted and compiled Python modules
- **Important Files:** Individual plugins with `.scramble` extension
- **Decryption:** All decryption information is on a machine running Toolbox
- **Source Code:** Uncompyle6 provides source code, with comments left intact

## Bootloader
- **Donor Vehicle Config:** Pack ID "57"
- **Extracted Firmware Files:** Pack ID 57 becomes Pack ID 70 after the changes

## Firmware Upgrade
- **Upgrade Instructions and Files:** Stored in Toolbox files
- **DBC Files:** Help understand signals on the PT CAN bus, stored in Python pickle format
- **ODX Files:** Define shunt calibration, grant security access, and upgrade firmware
- **Calibration Data and Firmware:** Stored in Python pickle format
- **Text Comments and Data Structures:** Offer clues on the process

## CAN and UDS
- **CAN Network Stack:** Uses UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) protocol for:
  - Diagnosing problems
  - Reading sensor values
  - Updating firmware
- **DBC File:** Descriptor file for CAN networks
- **ODX/GMD File:** Scripting file for UDS networks
- **Commercial Tool:** Vehicle Spy used for research
- **ARBS 7E2 and 202:** Identify max current as a static value
- **ARBS 232 (BMS), 266 (DI), and 2E5 (DIS):** Identify max power in watts, varying based on SOC, temperature, and recent power usage

## Shunt Modification
- **Hardware Modification:** Single wire connecting the shunt to the CPLD
- **Alert and Refusal:** If the wire remains connected after the firmware update, the BMS generates an alert and refuses to close the contactors
- **Bench Testing:** Discovered through bench testing and monitoring signals from the shunt
- **Breakout Board:** Used to monitor signals from the shunt
- **Update Sequence:** Both hardware and firmware must be updated before driving the car

## Upgrade Process
- **Garage and Lift Access:** Southern California
- **Low SOC Arrival:** Drive there with low state of charge
- **Pack Drop and Hardware Work:** Reinstall pack carefully (image from borescope)
- **Firmware Flashing:**
  - Special firmware for shunt modification
  - New pack ID
  - Update `internal.dat` to add ludicrous and change pack ID
  - Redeploy firmware due to changed battery pack ID
- **Drive Away and Enjoy:** The increased torque

## Final Steps
- **Firmware Redeployment:** Tried known techniques and multiple versions
- **Car Failure:** Had to tow the car from Rancho Cucamonga to Las Vegas
- **Cost:** $360
- **Validation Check:** Gateway uses `firmware.rc` for validation
- **CRC Calculation:** Based on CAN and value from `signed_metadata_map.tsv`
- **JAMCRC:** Final CRC line is JAMCRC based on overall file
- **Resolution:** Car woke up, errors cleared, and it could be driven

## Power Before and After Upgrade
- **Before Upgrade:** 1300 Amps
- **After Upgrade:** 1500 Amps
- **Actual Available:** Lower than expected, reasons to be determined

## Further Research
- **TMS320F2809:** Supported in IDA Pro
- **Max Current Definitions:** ARBS 7E2 and 202
- **Speed Increase Possibility:** Others have achieved 1000 HP RWD P85
- **Variable Adjustment:** Modify DU firmware
- **Safety Concerns:** High drain (20A/cell or ~6.6C) can burn out drive unit IGBTs or battery pack, or cause a fire
- **Shunt Parameters:** CAU1, CGI1
- **Deep Dive:** Car Hacking Village talk for detailed analysis and future project directions
