### Impact of RTO Granularity in TCP
Most responses with a timeout take at least one second. In this study, we did not attempt to empirically determine the "optimal" queue size for the drop-tail queue in our routers, which is likely to be between 300 and 2,000 elements. Finding the optimal drop-tail queue size involves a tradeoff between improving response times for the large number of small objects and the small number of very large objects that consume most of the network's capacity. Instead, we used a drop-tail queue of 240 elements as a baseline for comparing with Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms, as it corresponds to one of the targets selected for AQM and provides reasonable performance for drop-tail.

### 4.1 Results for PI with Packet Drops
Figure 8 shows the results for Proportional-Integral (PI) control at target queue lengths of 24 and 240, and offered loads of 80%, 90%, and 98%. At 80% load, there is essentially no difference in response times between the two target queue lengths, and their performance is very close to that obtained on an uncongested network. At 90% load, the two target queue sizes provide nearly identical results, except for the 10% of responses requiring more than 500 milliseconds to complete. For these requests, the longer target size of 240 performs somewhat better. At 98% load, the shorter queue target of 24 is a better choice as it improves response times for shorter responses without degrading response times for the longer responses.

### 4.2 Results for REM with Packet Drops
Figure 9 presents the results for Random Early Marking (REM) at target queue lengths of 24 and 240, and offered loads of 80%, 90%, and 98%. At 80% load, there is essentially no difference in response times between the two target queue lengths, and their performance is very close to that obtained on an uncongested network. At 90% load, a queue reference of 24 performs much better than a target queue of 240. At 98% load, a queue reference of 24 continues to perform slightly better than 240. Overall, REM performs best when used with a target queue reference of 24.

### 4.3 Results for ARED with Packet Drops
Figure 10 shows the results for Adaptive Random Early Detection (ARED) at the two target queue lengths, and offered loads of 80%, 90%, and 98%. These results are quite surprising. In contrast to drop-tail, PI, and REM, the results at 80% load show some degradation relative to the results on an uncongested link. At this load, there is essentially no difference in response times between the two target queue lengths. At 90% load, there is still little difference in performance among the two target queues for ARED, but the overall degradation from an uncongested link is more substantial. At 98% load, the two settings for ARED are again almost indistinguishable from each other, and response times, overall, are very poor.

Due to the consistently poor performance of ARED, we tried several different sets of parameters. We tested the recommended settings for our network capacity: minth at 60, maxth at 180, and wq at 1/16384. We also varied the parameter wq from 1/1024 up to 1/16384, but none of the settings yielded better results than those presented here. Based on our experiments, we cannot recommend a setting for ARED, as the performance for all tested configurations was very similar and unsatisfactory.
