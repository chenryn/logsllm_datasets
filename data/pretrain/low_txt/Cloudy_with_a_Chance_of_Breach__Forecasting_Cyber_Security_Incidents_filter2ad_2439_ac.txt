**Figure 2: Comparison of Mismanagement Symptoms Between Victim and Non-Victim Populations**
- **Description**: This figure compares the mismanagement symptoms between victim and non-victim organizations. The first two metrics show a clear separation, while the other three are weaker predictors.
- **Metrics**:
  - Untrusted HTTPS: 0% to 1%
  - Open Resolver: 0% to 0.4%
  - DNS Random Port: 0% to 1%
  - Open SMTP Mail Relays: 0% to 0.05%
  - BGP Misconfiguration: 0% to 1%

**Figure 4: Profile of Selected Temporal Features Extracted from Scanning Time Series (Nov. 13-Dec. 13)**
- **Description**: This figure illustrates the profile of selected temporal features extracted from the scanning time series over the specified period. The features include un-normalized "bad" magnitude, normalized "good" magnitude, "bad" duration, and "bad" frequency.
- **Key Points**:
  - The un-normalized "bad" magnitude ranges from 0 to 200.
  - The normalized "good" magnitude ranges from 0 to 1.
  - The "bad" duration ranges from 0 to 30 days.
  - The "bad" frequency ranges from 0 to 1.

**Temporal Feature Analysis**
- **Magnitude and Duration**:
  - The average magnitude (both normalized and unnormalized) is measured.
  - The average duration that the time series persists in a "bad" region upon each entry is calculated.
  - The frequency at which the time series enters a "bad" region is also measured.
- **Feature Vectors**:
  - Each organization has three time series, one for each malicious activity type.
  - Four summary statistics are derived for each region, resulting in 12 values per time series.
  - A total of 36 derived features per organization are collected, denoted by the feature vector \( F_i \).
- **Time Periods**:
  - Two feature vectors are used: Recent-60 (collected over 60 days) and Recent-14 (collected over 14 days).

**Training and Testing Procedure**
- **Training Data**:
  - **Group(1)**: A subset of incident or victim organizations.
  - **Group(0)**: A randomly selected set of non-victim organizations.
- **Testing Data**:
  - **Group(1c)**: The subset of victim organizations not included in Group(1).
  - **Non-Victim Test Set**: A randomly selected set of non-victim organizations not used in training.
- **Feature Sets**:
  - For victim organizations: Mismanagement symptoms, time series, and secondary features.
  - For non-victim organizations: Similar feature sets, but collected over the same time periods as the victim organizations.

**Prediction Schemes**
- **Short-Term Forecast**:
  - Features are collected over the two months prior to the incident month.
  - Prediction window is one month.
- **Long-Term Forecast**:
  - Features are collected over the two months prior to the first incident in Group(1c).
  - Prediction window can be up to a year.

**Incident Prediction Results**
- **Main Results**:
  - Prediction using three incident datasets separately and collectively.
  - Training and testing data are split chronologically.
  - ROC curves show prediction performance with combined (TP, FP) values of (90%, 10%) or (80%, 5%).
  - Combined dataset achieves an accuracy level of (88%, 4%).

  - TP: 80%
  - FP: 5%
- **WHID**:
  - TP: 88%
  - FP: 5%
