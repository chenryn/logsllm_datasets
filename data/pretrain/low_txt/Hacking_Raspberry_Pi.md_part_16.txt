### Configuring Remote Access to Raspbmc

1. **Access System Information:**
   - Navigate to `System` > `System Info` and note the IP address displayed in the `IP Address` field.

2. **Enable Webserver Control:**
   - Go to `System` > `Settings` > `Services` > `Webserver`.
   - Enable the option `Allow control of XBMC via HTTP`.

3. **Connect via Web Browser:**
   - Open a web browser and enter the IP address (e.g., `http://10.1.10.1`) in the address bar.
   - This will allow you to remotely connect to your Raspbmc server.

4. **Manage Content via Web Interface:**
   - Upon successful connection, you will see a simple and intuitive interface for managing the content on your Raspbmc device (see Figure 12.9).
   - **Figure 12.9:** XBMC includes a simple web-based management tool (and remote control, of course).

**Note: Customizing the Web Interface:**
- In the XBMC Webserver Property page, you can download additional web interface skins to change the look and feel.
- Click `Default`, then `Get More...` to browse and install new skins. Ensure your Raspbmc device is connected to the Internet for this process.

### Configuring a GPIO-based IR Receiver

**Task: Configuring a GPIO-based IR Receiver**

1. **Hardware Requirements:**
   - If you want to control Raspbmc using an infrared (IR) remote, you have two options:
     - Purchase an IR receiver and wire it directly to the GPIO pins on the Pi board.
     - Purchase a USB IR receiver, plug it into your powered USB hub, and load the appropriate drivers.

2. **Parts Needed:**
   - TSOP38238 IR receiver
   - Female-to-female jumper wires
   - Mini remote control

3. **Connecting the IR Receiver:**
   - Connect three female-to-female jumper wires as follows:
     - IR receiver pin #1 to GPIO pin #18 (data)
     - IR receiver pin #2 to GPIO pin GND (ground)
     - IR receiver pin #3 to GPIO pin 3V3 (3.3V power)
   - **Figure 12.10:** Schematic showing the GPIO pin connections to the IR sensor using female-to-female jumper wires.

4. **Configure LIRC:**
   - Log into XBMC on your Raspberry Pi and navigate to `Programs` > `Raspbmc Settings` > `IR Remote`.
   - Disable the setting `Enable GPIO TSOP IR Receiver` while testing the hardware remote.
   - When ready to test, enable this setting and note the Raspbmcâ€™s IP address.

**Note: Understanding TSOP:**
- TSOP stands for Thin, Small Outline Package, referring to the physical form factor of the IC chip. It is a general term applicable to many types of IC components, not just IR receivers.

5. **Command Line Configuration:**
   - Use SSH to connect to your Raspbmc box. The default username is `pi` and the password is `raspberry`.
   - For detailed instructions, refer to the Adafruit tutorial: [Using an IR Remote with a Raspberry Pi Media Center](http://is.gd/97RvGt).
   - Additional resources are available at [eLinux.org](http://is.gd/yaJOSw), which lists verified peripheral devices for the Raspberry Pi.

### Transferring Content to Your Pi

**Task: Uploading Media Content to Raspberry Pi**

1. **Start FileZilla:**
   - Fill in the details in the Quickconnect bar:
     - Host: [Your Raspbmc IP address]
     - Username: `pi`
     - Password: `raspberry`
     - Port: Leave empty (default is TCP port 21)

2. **Create Directories:**
   - By default, you will be in the `/home/pi` directory.
   - Right-click in the Remote site window and select `Create Directory` to create the following folders:
     - Movies
     - TV
     - Music
     - Pictures
   - **Figure 12.11:** FileZilla makes it simple to upload your media content to the Raspbmc device.

3. **Transfer Files:**
   - Drag and drop files from your local file system (e.g., OS X Finder, Windows Explorer, or FileZilla Local Site pane) to the appropriate destination in the FileZilla Remote site pane.
   - Progress information will be displayed in the bottom pane of FileZilla.

**Note: Using USB Storage:**
- If your SD card is not large enough, you can use a USB thumb drive as a media source. Populate the USB stick with your media, plug it into the powered USB hub, and specify the USB location when configuring media detection.

### Scraping Your Media

**Media Scraper Overview:**
- A media scraper detects, analyzes, and reports metadata for media files in XBMC. For example, it can fill in plot summaries, cast, original air dates, etc.
- Supported media types include video games, music, movies, TV shows, and internet-based videos.

**Best Practices:**
- Name your media files descriptively and without spaces to help scrapers work more efficiently.
- **Figure 12.12:** Example of best practices for naming media files (e.g., `Big.Bang.Theory.s06e01`).

**Configuring Media Detection:**

1. **Navigate to Video Files:**
   - In XBMC, go to `Video` > `Files`.

2. **Add Video Source:**
   - Click `Add Videos...` and select your target directory (e.g., `/home/pi/tv`).

3. **Set Content:**
   - Set the `This Directory Contains` option to the desired media type (e.g., TV shows).
   - Choose a scraper service and click `OK` to perform a full scan.

**Note: Preparing Metadata:**
- Windows users can use the free Media Companion (http://is.gd/qemjHg) to prepare media file metadata on their personal computer before transferring to XBMC.

### Playing Your Content

**XBMC Player Controls:**

- **Figure 12.15:** Guide to XBMC player controls.
  - **Playback Controls:** Self-explanatory for anyone familiar with DVD players.
  - **Subtitle Management:** For more information, see [Subtitle Usage Guide](http://is.gd/PmFob0).
  - **Video Settings:** Adjust aspect ratio, black bar cropping, brightness, and contrast.
  - **Audio Settings:** Customize delay, subtitles, and other audio settings.
  - **Bookmarks:** Set, go to, and delete bookmarks (a favorite feature).

### Installing Add-Ons

**Extending XBMC Functionality:**

- Navigate to the home page in Raspbmc and hover over `Pictures`, `Videos`, `TV Shows`, or `Music`.
- Click `Add-ons` and then `Get More...` to browse and install add-ons.
- **Figure 12.16:** Add-ons expand the functionality of your XBMC-based media player system.

### Chapter 13. Raspberry Pi Retro Game Station

**Introduction:**
- This chapter covers converting the Raspberry Pi into a retro gaming station using RetroPie, focusing on Atari 2600 VCS and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulation.

**Console Emulation:**
- Emulation involves running one processor architecture to mimic another, allowing the Raspberry Pi to play games from classic systems like the Atari 2600, NES, and others.

**RetroPie Project:**
- RetroPie is a project that provides an SD card image with Raspbian, RetroArch (the emulator), and Emulation Station (the graphical front end).

**Installing RetroPie:**

1. **Download and Flash Image:**
   - Download the RetroPie SD card image from [petRockBlog](http://is.gd/BSyKRP).
   - Extract the image and flash it to your SD card using a flashing utility.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - Plug in your joystick or gamepad if you have one.
   - Boot the Raspberry Pi and follow the Emulation Station wizard to configure your controller (see Figure 13.2).
   - If no joystick is detected, press F4 to exit the wizard.

3. **Transferring ROMs:**
   - ROMs are bit-for-bit copies of data from game cartridges.
   - To legally download a ROM, you must own the original game cartridge.
   - Transfer ROMs to your RetroPie device using a USB stick or network transfer.

**Note: Creating ROMs:**
- To create a ROM from a cartridge, you need dedicated hardware. Alternatively, you can download ROMs from trusted sources like AtariAge.com if you own the corresponding cartridges.

This guide should help you set up and manage your Raspbmc and RetroPie projects effectively.
