**USB Fingerprinting: A Technique for Machine Identification**

USB Fingerprinting is a method that can identify unique machines with high accuracy, distinguishing them based on attributes such as machine model and operating system. Our research demonstrates that a standard smartphone is sufficient for collecting the necessary data, eliminating the need for expensive, specialized USB analyzers. This finding opens up new possibilities for future research, especially as more unique interfaces, each with their own distinct characteristics, enter the market.

**Future Work and Applications**

Future work will focus on determining the effectiveness of our techniques on other technologies, such as Firewire, Apple's Lightning interface, and other common interfaces. We also aim to explore whether we can relax the requirement for detaching peripherals before measurement. Formalizing and modeling interactions with these protocols will be of significant interest to those looking to exploit or defend these interfaces and the devices that use them.

**Availability**

The source code for the Android USB Analyzer and Android USB Identifier apps, along with datasets of USB enumeration traces, will be available on our lab website at [http://osiris.cs.uoregon.edu](http://osiris.cs.uoregon.edu).
