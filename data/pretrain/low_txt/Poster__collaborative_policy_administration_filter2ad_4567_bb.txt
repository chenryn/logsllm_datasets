### Design Process and Subsequent Involvement in Iterative Design and Testing of the Office Intervention

Participation in the design process has highlighted the challenges faced by the medical community in patient education initiatives. The methodologies and theories that designers use to create products are well-established and introspective. In contrast, the medical community often lacks a structured protocol or design methodology for creating patient information. Additionally, medical patient information is typically unidirectional, such as providing a pamphlet with information deemed important by healthcare providers.

In contrast, "human-centered design" revolves around a conversation, marking a new era in medicine. This shift moves from a paternalistic approach ("I am the doctor, and this is what you should do because I said so") to one of informed patients and shared decision-making.

Participants in the design process embraced their roles as designers, and the skills and methods they learned carried over into their own practices. By becoming part of the process, they were better equipped to adapt it to their needs in future scenarios. One participant noted, "We get to ensure our most important messages are included in the materials, but you help us present them in a way that is appealing to our patients. We learn a lot about what our patients want and need from conversations with their doctors, which influences how we approach problems beyond the specific design question."

### The Results of the Co-Creative Process: Fitwits MD

Fitwits MD, the result of the co-creative process, consists of a set of seventeen educational flashcards designed to help physicians initiate conversations with patients about obesity, family history, body mass index (BMI), and practical directives on portion control, nutrition, and fitness. The flashcards introduce engaging Fitwits characters that clarify confusing health terms and spark discussions about obesity-related conditions like type-2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Fitwits MD assists primary care family health physicians in increasing health literacy and influencing wellness choices among children and their families. The tool ensures that all patients and their families can learn the content, regardless of their diagnosis, and continued interaction with the core health messages increases awareness of the problem. The program is designed to accommodate and educate a wide range of families.

### Evaluation and Outcome

Physicians reported that the Fitwits MD intervention facilitated meaningful conversations between physicians, patients, and their families. They found the intervention engaging, and patients and their families were receptive to the material presented, leading to extended conversations and questions. Most felt the intervention helped identify and discuss behaviors related to diet and nutrition (e.g., fast food consumption, soda intake, number of weekly family meals) and activities (e.g., gym visits, screen time). The study also indicated that Fitwits MD improved physicians' comfort and competence when discussing obesity prevention with children and parents (McGaffey et al., 2011).

### The Co-Design Process in Practice

Co-design refers to a creative process through which collective creativity unfolds throughout the design process (Sanders and Stappers, 2008). Sanders argued that participation in co-design reflects the creativity levels demonstrated in people's lives. As creativity grows, so does expertise, interest, passion, and effort (Frascara, 2006). In high-paced domains like healthcare delivery, tools and services are appropriated, adapted, and modified by the user community (Nardi and O’Day, 1996). We have come to understand that co-design is critical for the emergence, dissemination, and adaptation phases linked to communication tools and services in healthcare settings.

In our experience working with healthcare professionals and families, we identified four common barriers to co-design participation:
1. Limited understanding of the field of design.
2. The paradigm shift required to change from using to adapting and creating tools.
3. Limited available time.
4. Limited trust in the overall value of the design process.

We use three terms to describe the necessary scaffolding phases for an effective co-design process: emergence, dissemination, and adaptation. The emergence phase involves the creation of a new product or service via participatory design methods, co-creation, and iterative testing. The dissemination phase involves recruiting, training, and championing the new product or service within the user community. The adaptation phase involves empowering continued innovation cycles, which may include product, service, process, and social innovation.

In summary, participants in a co-design process experience the emergence of a design solution, while others are involved in its dissemination and adaptation. We argue that co-creation cannot stop after deployment; designers must strive for a process that enables ongoing co-design, ensuring the user community takes ownership of both the process and the outcome. In our study, co-design proved to be a process adaptable by non-designers.

### Physicians as Co-Designers

The role of physicians as co-designers is evident in their involvement during the emergence, dissemination, and adaptation phases. During the emergence phase, participants engaged in thinking, making, creating, and evaluating the Fitwits MD intervention. In the dissemination phase, they brainstormed and implemented protocols to deliver the intervention. In the adaptation phase, they developed new ways to engage physicians and patients with the intervention.

During the emergence phase, physicians learned about design and how to apply design methods to new challenges. One physician compared the design process to medical practice, highlighting the barriers physicians face:
"Having watched and admired the design process, I suppose it is something like the art of medicine but with observation and reflective listening by designers to several parties, all of whom must trust that their thoughts and ideas are appreciated and not subservient. That is an interesting proposition for any physician, who might expect to produce some ideas that trump others – but that is not the case. It so happens that the critical work really turns on the ideas, learning styles, and playfulness of children and oftentimes, of parents who may not have profited from formal education."

The design process engaged some physicians to the point that they willingly took on more work, even amidst already hectic schedules:
"The collaborative design process generates more reflections, ideas, and voluntary work than one might expect to contribute, and there is an amazement and excitement that is palpable, especially as a tool or strategy is generated almost 'out of thin air' from diverse conversations and activities in design workshops."

### Dissemination and Adaptation

Despite months of careful planning and iterating on the design of the tool, few interventions occurred during the first three months of the dissemination phase. The apparent lack of interest motivated the design, medical, and evaluation teams to brainstorm solutions to increase the use of the intervention. The resulting solutions included:
- New dissemination protocols.
- Assigned roles for dissemination (recruits, trainers, and champions).
- Physical reminders (e.g., buttons, screen savers).
- An intervention challenge game between the three participating Family Health Centers (FHCs) to encourage participation.

Once these protocols were put in place, patients started receiving the Fitwits MD intervention, trainers learned the materials and trained others, and champions organized and disseminated the intervention. To help office staff and physicians remember to deliver the intervention, the team created "What is Fitwits?" buttons and computer screen savers. The physicians also launched a poster contest to promote increased awareness of Fitwits in their medical centers. The positive response inspired the design and medical teams to add a mural and interactive game in the waiting room to engage patients before their visit.

Additionally, FHCs voluntarily made changes in snack choices, bringing in healthier options. Outreach activities expanded the network of Fitwits MD, including training social workers who visit individuals who are morbidly obese and cannot leave their homes.

### Conclusion

Obesity prevention is challenging for physicians during well-child visits. The boundaries of problems related to obesity prevention are tied to context and the actors involved. We framed our argument around the value of co-creation and identified scaffolds within the co-design process for developing effective health communications, prevention, and behavior change.

### Implications for Design Practice

Long-term systemic change often requires time and patience, which current design practices may not fully consider. Time is needed to develop an understanding of how and why a design solution has had an impact and to measure and evaluate that change. Service design can help change policy by:
- Recognizing health literacy as a service, not just an artifact.
- Helping healthcare providers learn what they need to know and how to act appropriately.
- Addressing individual, family, organizational, community, and government levels, where individual behavior motivates broader changes.
- Emphasizing the importance of willingness to change in the behavior change process.
- Creating a safe environment for people to learn, try, and practice healthy lifestyles.
