### Performance Evaluation of Apache Web Server

We evaluated the latency and bandwidth of the Apache web server. The ApacheBench tool was run on a laptop connected to our desktop machine via a one Gigabit Ethernet cable. We used the default configurations for Apache.

#### Latency Evaluation
- **File Size**: 1KB
- **Concurrency Levels**: 1, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250
- **Repetitions**: 10,000 requests per experiment

#### Bandwidth Evaluation
- **File Sizes**: 100B, 1KB, 10KB, 100KB, and 1MB
- **Concurrency Level**: 32
- **Network I/O Saturation**: Not saturated except for the 1MB file
- **Repetitions**: 10,000 requests per experiment

**Results**:
- The blind mode incurred an average slowdown of 0.7% in the concurrency experiment and 0.9% in the bandwidth experiment.
- UniSan, however, imposes a 10x slowdown, which is too high for practical adoption as a prevention tool.

### Memory Safety and Model Checking Techniques

Several memory safety techniques have been proposed to prevent spatial memory errors (e.g., out-of-bound reads) and use-after-free bugs. Model checking techniques can detect semantic errors caused by developers. These tools are effective in detecting or preventing kernel leaks caused by spatial memory errors, use-after-free, or semantic errors, and thus are complementary to UniSan.

- **DieHard [4]**: Probabilistically detects uninitialized memory uses for heap but not stack.
- **Cling [2]**: Constrains memory allocation to allow address space reuse only among objects of the same type, mitigating exploits of temporal memory errors.
- **StackArmor [7]**: Provides sophisticated stack protection, including prevention of uninitialized reads in binaries. It uses stack layout randomization to probabilistically prevent inter-procedural uninitialized reads.
- **Type Systems [12, 15]**: Can prevent dangling pointers, uninitialized pointer dereferences, and out-of-bound accesses, but do not cover uninitialized data leaks.

### Protections Using Zero-Initialization

Zero-initialization has been used in previous works to achieve protections. However, it has limitations:

- **Secure Deallocation [8]**: Zero-initializes deallocated memory to reduce data exposure risk. However, deallocations are not always available (e.g., in the case of memory leaks), and selective zeroing for efficiency is challenging.
- **Lacuna [13]**: Allows users to run programs in "private sessions" and erases all memory after the session ends.
- **StackArmor [7]**: Zero-initializes intra-procedural allocations that cannot be proven secure against uninitialized reads.

### Discussion and Future Work

#### Custom Heap Allocator
UniSan currently tracks typical heap allocators (kmalloc and kmem_cache_alloc). To handle custom heap allocations (e.g., alloc_skb), UniSan can use allocator specifications provided by developers. For user space programs, LLVM already provides an API `isMallocLikeFn` to test whether a function call allocates uninitialized memory based on heuristics. We plan to use similar heuristics to infer "malloc-like" functions in the kernel.

#### Source Code Requirement
Source code is required. If some kernel drivers are closed-source, we must carefully identify all possible calls targeting these drivers and assume them as sinks. Failure to identify such calls will result in incomplete call graphs and false negatives.

#### Security Impacts of Zero-Initialization
Some systems use uninitialized memory as a source of randomness. For example, the SSLeay implementation of OpenSSL uses uninitialized buffers as an entropy source. Zero-initialization reduces this entropy, but using uninitialized data as a randomness source is insecure and should be avoided.

#### False Positives
UniSan eliminates false negatives by increasing the false positive rate. There is room to reduce false positives using point-to analysis and dynamic taint analysis. Since false positives do not affect program semantics but introduce performance overhead, and UniSan is already efficient, we leave these optimizations for future work.

#### More Kernel Modules
Our experiments included only modules enabled by the default kernel configurations. The current Linux kernel has around 20,000 modules, many of which were not included. Some modules are not compilable by LLVM and require additional engineering effort. As a proof-of-concept, supporting these additional modules is out-of-scope, but we may rely on the open-source community for patches or port UniSan to GCC.

#### Beyond Kernels
UniSan's detection and instrumentation work at the LLVM IR level, making it extendable to protect user space programs. To support user space programs, the IR of libraries should be included, and sources (for heap) and sinks should be redefined. In future work, we will use UniSan to detect and prevent information leaks in security- and privacy-sensitive programs like OpenSSL.

### Conclusion

Information leaks in the kernel pose a major security threat, rendering protection mechanisms like kASLR and StackGuard ineffective and leaking security-sensitive data. Uninitialized data reads are particularly critical. Existing defenses cannot completely and efficiently prevent uninitialized data leaks.

**Key Idea of UniSan**:
- Use byte-level, flow-sensitive, and context-sensitive reachability and initialization analysis to identify any allocation that leaves the kernel without being fully initialized.
- Automatically instrument the kernel to initialize such allocations.
- UniSan has no false negatives, preventing all possible uninitialized data leaks in the kernel.

**Application and Results**:
- Applied to the latest Linux and Android kernels.
- Successfully prevented 43 known uninitialized data leaks and many new ones.
- 19 of the new data leak vulnerabilities were confirmed by the Linux community and Google.
- Extensive evaluation shows UniSan is robust and imposes only a negligible performance overhead.
