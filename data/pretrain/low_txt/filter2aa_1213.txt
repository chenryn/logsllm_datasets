### DefCon 16 – Asleep at the Wheel

- **Firefox Possession Incident:**
  - DNS redirection allowed for the insertion of malicious code on legitimate webpages.

- **Milw0rm.lzm in /mnt/live/memory/images:**
  - The `uselivemod` tool in the BT/Tools directory was used to slipstream a module on the fly, which automatically updated IP and calls to Milw0rm.

- **MBR Rootkit:**
  - Vmlinuz (compressed kernel) files were replaced with replicas to subvert GRUB.
  - Attempting to load BackTrack (BT) with the `nohdd` option caused a reboot, possibly due to the MBR rootkit's dependency on virtual memory created on the hard drive.

### What You Should Have Done

- **Leave Your Laptop at Home!**

- **Use a Broadband Wireless Card:**
  - Ensure your laptop has all the necessary updates and patches.
  - Use a laptop with no important data on it.
  - Do not use your work or home laptop.
  - Utilize a virtual machine (VM) for added security.

### What You Can Do Now

- **Lock Down BIOS/MBR:**
  - Enable system password protection.
  - Enable MBR protection within the BIOS to make the MBR read-only.

- **Configuration Changes (Linux/Windows):**
  - Edit `hosts.deny` to block unwanted connections.
  - Configure the firewall.
  - Close unnecessary services.
  - Change the default root password (e.g., for BackTrack).
  - Install and configure an antivirus (AV) solution.
  - Use Conky for system monitoring.
  - Set up hard-coded DNS servers.

- **Comprehensive Hardening:**
  - Use security templates for Windows.
  - Use Bastille for Linux (available at [Bastille-Linux](http://bastille-linux.sourceforge.net/)).
  - Implement Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS).
  - Block all inbound connections.
  - Protect your DNS entries, ARP tables, and logs.

- **SSH Proxy:**
  - Tunnel Firefox over SSH.
  - Verify your server’s SSH key beforehand.

- **Firefox Hardening:**
  - Install and use NoScript.
  - Turn off DNS proxy in `about:config`.
  - Use a known good proxy.

- **Network Monitoring:**
  - Run Snort and ensure it is patched.
  - Snort will detect wireless anomalies.
  - Use Kismet (Linux) to alert on deauth floods and broadcast disassociations.
  - Use AirSnare (Windows) for additional monitoring.

- **Avoid Sensitive Activities:**
  - Do not check email, visit LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.
  - Even after SSL login, many sessions may be in cleartext.

### How to Tell if You Just Got Pwned

- **Check Logs:**
  - Verify MD5 hashes.
  - Check system binaries (e.g., telnet, ls, login, finger) against known checksums, preferably in single-user mode.

- **Forensic Tools:**
  - Use tools like Backtrack for forensic analysis.
  - Monitor `/etc/services` and `/etc/inetd.conf`.

- **Portscan Detection:**
  - Refer to nMap Network Scanning (Fyodor, p.283).
  - Use Scanlogd, PortSentry, ZoneAlarm (Windows), and Psad (Linux) for intrusion detection and log analysis.

### Strike Back!

- **Participate in the Hostile Network:**
  - Be prepared to terminate access or impart retribution.
  - Use tools like windentd and icepick (nMap Network Scanning, p.264).
  - Employ Scanlogd, PortSentry, and targeted DOS attacks.
  - Note: Do not perform DOS attacks on the DefCon network, as it is considered very poor form and can result in consequences.
