**ATT&CK ID:** T1110.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Password Cracking

Adversaries may employ password cracking techniques to recover usable credentials, such as plaintext passwords, when they have obtained credential material like password hashes. While OS Credential Dumping can be used to acquire these password hashes, this method alone may not be sufficient if Pass the Hash (PtH) is not a viable option. In such cases, adversaries might also exploit data from configuration repositories to obtain hashed credentials for network devices.
