### 7.5 Limbo Signature
We have developed a Picnic-like post-quantum signature scheme based on AES, using the same methodology as BBQ [21] and Banquet [3]. Specifically, given a private key \( k \) and public values \((x, y)\) such that \( \text{AES}_k(x) = y \), a signature on a message \(\mu\) is generated by binding \(\mu\) with a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge of \( k \).

We compare our resulting signature scheme, Limbo, with Picnic and Banquet, which, to the best of our knowledge, are the fastest MPCitH-based signatures using AES for security levels L1, L3, and L5 as specified by NIST [37]. Tables 8, 9, and 10 show this comparison for different sets of parameters. For all three security levels, Limbo not only outperforms Banquet in both Prover and Verifier time but also consistently produces shorter signatures. These results are closer to, and sometimes better than, the performance of Picnic in terms of running times (for \( n = 16 \)) and signature size (for \( n = 255 \)).

In Table 7, we compare Limbo as an interactive identification scheme to the equivalent variant of Picnic. Note that for Picnic, based on KKW, the number of repetitions indicates both offline and online repetitions. As before, the communication can be further reduced using more parties (down to 2.43KB) at the expense of slightly longer computation time (still under 5ms for both Prover and Verifier).

### A. Amortized Evaluations for the Multi-Instance Case
While our MPC and ZK protocols work over fields of any size, the multiplications check requires large fields to achieve a reasonable soundness error. When the evaluation field \( F \) is small, such as \( F = F_2 \), this step can be inefficient. To address this, it would be beneficial to batch several checks into a single one. Ideally, when proving the satisfiability of a certain circuit, it would be helpful to perform the check of all the \( \tau \) repetitions needed to obtain the desired soundness in one go. However, since in the ZK protocol the verifier opens different sets of parties across the \( \tau \) MPC evaluations, packing these checks together seems difficult, if not impossible. 

Nonetheless, we can apply the same idea to batch the checking phases in the case of multiple evaluations of the same circuit. Specifically, if we want to prove the satisfiability of a certain circuit multiple times, say \( h \), we can amortize these instances using the reverse multiplication-friendly embedding (RMFE) [13, 18], which provides a way to embed the ring \( F_q^h \), for some \( h > 1 \), into a field \( F_{q^s} \), for some \( s > h \), so that coordinate-wise products "map" to multiplications in the extension field. Formally, we recall the following definition:

**Definition A.1.** Given a prime power \( q \) and \( h, s \in \mathbb{N} \), let us consider two \( F_q \)-linear maps \( \phi : F_q^h \to F_{q^s} \) and \( \psi : F_{q^s} \to F_q^h \). A pair \( (\phi, \psi) \) is called an \((h, s)\)-reverse multiplication-friendly embedding (RMFE) if for all \( x, y \in F_q^h \), it holds:
\[ x \odot y = \psi(\phi(x) \cdot \phi(y)), \]
where \( \odot \) is the component-wise product.

Note that \( \phi \) is an injective map. In the following, we focus on the case \( q = 2 \) and leave other cases for future work. In [18], the authors provide both asymptotic and concrete results on the existence of RMFE. Specifically:

**Lemma A.2.** For all \( u \leq 33 \), there exists a \((3u, 10u - 5)_2\)-RMFE. For any \( u \leq 16 \), there exists a \((2u, 8u)_2\)-RMFE.

### Different Options to Improve Efficiency
We explore different options to handle the multi-instance case with better efficiency. For each alternative, we briefly discuss the advantages and disadvantages.

**Check with Identical Challenges:** The first approach consists of \( \tau \cdot h \) MPC evaluations of the circuit over \( F_2 \), followed by a checking phase. We can apply the optimization described in the previous section and use the same challenge across all evaluations. This option will require, at least in the non-interactive case, a larger \( \tau \), but this can be mitigated in part by using larger extension fields for the check. We expect an improvement in prover run times comparable to that observed for the single instance case.

**Evaluations in Extension Fields:** Alternatively, we can use an RMFE and "pack" \( h \) MPC evaluations over \( F_2 \) into a single evaluation over \( F_{2^s} \), and hence perform the entire proof and verification in this extension field. The advantage of this approach is to perform the computation only once, but over a larger field. In terms of communication, this approach will be roughly 2/3 times more costly.

**Check in Extension Fields:** Our third option works as follows. In Phase 1, the prover runs \( h \) MPC evaluations over \( F_2 \) in its head, exactly as described in the previous sections. Before the next phases, the prover, using a \((h, s)_2 (\phi, \psi)\)-RMFE, consistently maps all the \( h \cdot m \) multiplication triples in \( F_2 \) that need to be checked to \( m \) triples in \( F_{2^s} \), and proceeds to the next phases. Specifically, given \( \langle x_i \rangle, \langle y_i \rangle, \langle z_i \rangle \in F_2^h \), we can apply \( \phi \) to these \( m \) vectors and obtain \( \phi(x_i) = x_i, \phi(y_i) = y_i, \phi(z_i) = z_i \). Note that if \( x \odot y = z \odot 1 \), then:
\[ \psi(\phi(x_i) \cdot \phi(y_i) - \phi(z_i) \cdot \phi(1)) = 0. \]

Setting \( z_i \cdot \phi(1) = \xi_i \), the prover needs to prove that the relation above holds. The analysis of the soundness of this option differs from that done in the previous sections, so we leave it for future work. However, if the maps \( \phi, \psi \) are efficiently implemented, this approach can potentially lead to better prover run times.
