### Motivation - MRTD

This image is a work of a Federal Bureau of Investigation employee, taken or made during the course of an employee's official duties. As a work of the U.S. federal government, the image is in the public domain.

#### The Government’s Dream
- Multi-biometric
- Double gates
- Anti-tailgating
- Lightly supervised (to maintain non-automated entry channels)

#### The Industry’s Solution
- Governments initially approached security print shops.
- These are general and global print shops with extensive know-how in secure printing but no expertise in IT security or cryptography.
- Security print shops then turned to the smart card industry.
- The smart card industry focuses on selling their products and advocates multi-purpose use.

#### Industry Ideas for the ePassport
- Multi-purpose use
- Identical design for national ID cards
- Use for electronic banking
- eGovernment
- Electronic signature
- Email encryption
- ID and travel/passport
- Electronic payment

### Design Goals
- Use of cryptography/PKI
- Heavy use of biometrics
- 100% security against counterfeiting
- Improve facilitation
- Minimize time spent on legitimate travelers
- Segmentation of low- and high-risk travelers
- Minimize immigration time for travelers

### Design Approach
- Setting up a standards group at the ICAO
- Comprised mainly of printing experts and some crypto experts
- Only worked on algorithm level; no one knows about implementation
- Driven by RFID manufacturers
- No one looked at risks or design goals (KISS principle)

### Problems with Patents
- To store biometric data, a HASH is typically generated and stored (for fast comparison).
- Most of these HASHES are patented.
- ICAO stores pictures of facial images (JPEG or JPEG2000).
- Same with fingerprints.
- Compromises don't work with security in ePassports.

### ePassports
This image is a work of a United States Department of Homeland Security employee, taken or made during the course of an employee's official duties. As a work of the U.S. federal government, the image is in the public domain.

#### MRTD
- Machine Readable Travel Document, also known as Electronic Passports (ePassports)
- Specifications by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization)
- Enrollment on a global basis

#### ePass from Germany
- RFID tag embedded into the cover
- Produced by Bundesdruckerei GmbH
- No shield, readable even when passport cover is closed

#### 2D Code and MRZ
- Passport with 2D barcode and MRZ (machine readable zone)

#### MRTD Data Layout
- LDS (Logical Data Structure)
- Data is stored in DG (Data Groups)
  - DG1: MRZ information (mandatory)
  - DG2: Portrait image + biometric template (mandatory)
  - DG3-9: Fingerprints, iris image (optional)
  - EF.SOD: Security Object Data (cryptographic signatures)
  - EF.COM: List of existing Data Groups
- Data is stored BER-encoded like ASN.1
- DG2-DG4 uses CBEFF for encoding (Common Biometric File Format, ISO 19785)

### MRTD Security Features
- Random UID for each activation
- Normally, all ISO 14443 transponders have a fixed unique serial number
- The UID is used for anti-collision
- Prevents tracking of owner without access control
- Problem: ICAO MRTD specs don't require a unique serial number
- Only some countries will generate random serial numbers

### Passive Authentication
- Mandatory for all passports
- Method of proof that the passport files are signed by the issuing country
- Inspection system verifies the hash of DG's
- EF.SOD contains individual signatures for each DG
- EF.SOD itself is signed
- Document signer public key from PKD/bilateral channels
- Document signer public key can be stored on the passport
- Useful only if the country’s root CA public key is known

### Signed Data
- EF.DG2, EF.DG3, EF.COM, EF.DG1
- HASH over data
- HASH over HASH
- Signed by Country CA
- EF.SOD

### Basic Access Control (BAC)
- Grants access to data after inspection systems are authorized
- Authorization through the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ)
  - Nine-digit document number
  - Six-digit date of birth
  - Six-digit expiry date
- 16 most significant bytes of SHA1-hash over MRZ_info are used as 3DES key for S/M (ISO7816 secure messaging)
- Some European passports (e.g., Belgium) don’t have BAC

### BAC and Traceability
- With the BAC handshake data known, the random unique ID is worthless
- The MRTD is traceable
- Access to the content (LDS-DG.1 & DG.2) is possible
- Access to the SOD is possible

### Extended Access Control (EAC)
- Optional method
- Should prevent unauthorized access to biometric data
- Not internationally standardized
- Implemented only by individual issuers
- Shared only with those countries allowed access
- Access is only possible with certificates from the issuing country

### Where is My Clock?
- The MRTD does not have any reliable and secure time information
- Once a CV is captured, all MRTDs read using a CV issued earlier could be accessed
- The biometric data is accessible
- The MRTD cannot verify the validity of the timestamp from a CV certificate
- A false CV certificate with an issue date far out in the future can deactivate the MRTD permanently

### EAC Risks
- A false CV certificate can deactivate the MRTD permanently
- A rogue regime could misuse CV certificates to obtain fingerprints from passport holders
- With these fingerprints, it is possible to produce false evidence

### PKI Integration
- X.509 Certificates
- Every issuer operates a self-controlled CA
- Signer keys are derived from CA root
- Public keys are distributed via ICAO PKD
- Everyone can verify
- It is not possible to revoke a certificate on the MRTD

### Why Cloning of Passports?
- Normal tags are read-only
- Data could be retrieved from an issued passport
- Deactivation of issued passport (microwave oven)
- Cloned tag behaves like an “official” ePassport
- Cloned tag could be extended with exploits
- Exploit could attack inspection system, backend, or databases

### Inspection Systems
- Should be evaluated
- Off-the-shelf PCs are too complex to be formally validated for correctness
- MRTD uses JPEG2000, which is very complicated and easy to exploit
- Example: CVE-2006-4391
- Metasploit and other toolkits make it easy

### A Vendor’s Design of an Inspection System
- Uses off-the-shelf PCs
- RFID-Reader is “Designed for Windows XP”
- No security improvement of the software
- Similar to inserting a USB stick containing unknown data into the inspection system

### Problem with the Procedure
- Data enters the officer's inspection system at the border
- Create HASH over payload
- Make inspection decision
- Read RFID chip from passport
- Decode LDS
- Decode BER in memory structures
- Process other DG
- Compare payload HASH with stored data
- Accept or reject ePassport

### Biometric Data
- Data should be reduced to hashes only
- But fingerprints will be stored as pictures
- Reverse-engineering of fingerprints possible with MRTD data
- Contrary to best practices in IT security

### Chaos of Standards
- TLV and ASN.1 not correctly implemented
- Redundant meta formats for biometric data
- If signing key is lost, the whole country is doomed
- First, the data must be parsed, then it can be verified
- Design was made by politicians, not IT security experts
- It is possible to manipulate data

### Snake Oil Warning
- “Trust us, we - the experts - know what we're doing”
- “We removed the standards from the ICAO website, now we are safe”
- “Grunwald used the primary purpose of the passport: he read it - there is no security risk”
- “The RFID chip will be protected by the security features of the printed paper in the passport”

### More Quotes
- After a short version of this presentation at the “Security Document World 2007” in London, a responsible person at the ICAO commented:
  - “It’s right that these security flaws could harm an IT system, but we have to keep in mind, the ePassport is a security document and has nothing to do with IT systems.”
