### Stakeholder Management Plan

The Organizational Change Management (OCM) Practitioner collaborates with the Project Manager to develop the Communication Management Plan, as outlined in the California-Project Management Framework (CA-PMF). Depending on the size and scope of the project, a single Communication Management Plan can be used, or a separate plan can be created specifically for OCM. In either case, it is crucial to include the Communication Management Plan Feedback Channels Amendment template in the development process.

In addition to the guidance provided in the CA-PMF and the Project Management Plan (PMP), the OCM Practitioner should consider incorporating the following concepts into the Communication Management Plan to address OCM objectives:

1. **Messages about the "why" of the project:**
   - Often, Communication Plans focus on reporting project status, progress, and milestones. While these details are valuable for involved stakeholders, such as the project team and Executive Steering Committee, they may not address the "why" of the project.
   - It cannot be assumed that all individuals involved in a change initiative fully understand the broader context. This can lead to questions such as:
     - Why is the initiative a priority?
     - What is the future vision for the organization, and how does the change align with this vision?
     - What are the objectives of the project?
     - Why is the organization implementing the change now?
   - Therefore, the OCM Practitioner should address these "why" questions related to the vision, mission, and objectives in Section 4.2 (Identify Stakeholder Communication Requirements) of the Communication Management Plan.

2. **Feedback opportunities:**
   - The OCM Practitioner must remember that communication is a two-way process. Stakeholders will have questions, need clarifications, and want to provide input.
   - By identifying feedback channels within the Communication Management Plan, the OCM Practitioner ensures that stakeholders feel heard and valued.
   - Feedback opportunities should be addressed as specific communication items, with defined collection channels and processes for feedback collection, analysis, and dissemination.
   - These processes should be documented using the Communication Management Plan Feedback Channels Amendment, which serves as an addition to the Communication Management Plan and helps identify communication feedback channels for employees, leaders, and stakeholders.

3. **Broader audiences:**
   - In the early stages, it is easy for a Communication Management Plan to focus solely on disseminating project status information to the project team.
   - However, the OCM Practitioner and Project Manager should discuss the benefits and risks of disseminating certain messages to a broader audience, following the guidance set forth in the Stakeholder Register and the Stakeholder Information Distribution Matrix within the Stakeholder Management Plan.
   - While detailed project status reports may not be appropriate for the entire affected population at this stage, it can be beneficial to start making these audiences aware of what may be coming, based on the Project Schedule.
   - High-level messages about the organization’s vision, project objectives, and a change initiative “mission statement” will help enroll stakeholders in preparation for the changes.
   - The OCM Practitioner should document the inclusion of broader audiences in the Communication Management Plan, specifically in Sections 4.1 (Identify Stakeholder Communication Requirements) and 4.4 (Define Communications Register).

### Deliver Planning Process Phase Communications

Once the Communication Management Plan is developed, communication messages will be disseminated according to the plan. Although the OCM Practitioner plays a key role in supporting and monitoring communication efforts, the actual communication should be the responsibility of the Project Manager and/or the Project Sponsor.

One of the responsibilities the OCM Practitioner may take on during the communication process is the collection, analysis, and reporting of communication feedback. For example, the OCM Practitioner may use informal conversations and observations to discover that employees participating in sessions to gather functional requirements appear disengaged or do not support the project objectives. After researching, the OCM Practitioner may find that the Project Sponsor has not communicated the business case for the change to these project team members. The OCM Practitioner will then work with the Project Manager and Project Sponsor to analyze the information and determine the appropriate delivery channel, timing, and message content to effectively communicate the drivers for change. The OCM Practitioner may also engage in Leadership Support activities to assist the Project Sponsor in building and demonstrating support for the change.

The OCM Practitioner works with the Project Manager and team members to develop and disseminate the right messages, to the right individuals, at the right time, through the right delivery channels. To record communication activities, the OCM Practitioner may use the Communication Action Log, a living document that tracks all communication activities.

Team Dynamics activities began in the Initiating Process Phase as the OCM Practitioner started defining behavior guidelines foundational to the project team. In the Planning Process Phase, the project team continues to grow and expand, which can often put a strain on the working environment and team culture. The OCM Practitioner works in this phase to build upon the team’s behavior guidelines and ingrain them into the team’s culture.
