As this limits the possibility for others to take action based on our results, we tried, whenever possible, to reach the network operators of ASes that consistently announce uniform prefixes.
43. **B. Monitor Filtering.** Figure 18 shows the distribution of the fraction of monitors that observe a given prefix based on all routing information available on January 15th of each year. While prefix visibility has increased over the decade, we find a clear separation between two distinct regions in the plot regardless of the year. On the leftmost side, we have locally visible prefixes (seen by less than 20% of monitors), and on the rightmost side, globally visible prefixes (seen by over 80% of monitors). Based on this finding, we decided to remove all routes to prefixes observed by less than one-third of all monitors, as indicated by the threshold line. Notably, picking any other threshold between 0.2 and 0.8 only results in negligible differences.

### Ethical Considerations

To conduct our study, we relied on both active and passive measurements. When using the PEERING testbed to actively announce prefixes to the Internet, we ensured that we did not overwhelm any networks by waiting 15 minutes between consecutive announcements. For active traffic sent from the PEERING testbed, we took the following precautions to avoid causing any harm:
- **Low Rate Probing:** Each target IP was probed with one ICMP, one TCP, and one UDP probe once per minute.
- **Avoiding Traffic Bursts:** Probes were evenly distributed throughout a one-minute interval to prevent bursts.
- **Contact Information:** Our contact information was included in the payload of each probe, providing details on how to opt-out of the probing process.

We did not receive any complaints or requests to opt-out during the entire duration of our active experiments.

### Effectiveness Timeline

**Figure 19: Effectiveness Experiment: Timeline and Experimental Setting (PX: Announcement of Prefix P with X ∈ {0, ..., 3} Prepends; WP: Withdraw P)**

In Figure 19, we depict the timeline of events and the configuration scenarios for each iteration of our effectiveness experiment. 

- **Scenario T1 (Baseline):** We create a baseline by announcing our prefix P via all upstreams without any prepending. After waiting 15 minutes for BGP to converge, we proceed to the next scenario.
- **Scenario T2 (Prepending):** We announce P with X prepends via the chosen upstreams. After another 15 minutes for BGP to converge, we start a 25-minute probing period. Each probe consists of ICMP, TCP, and UDP pings triggered once per minute to all targets. To reduce probing bursts, packets are spread evenly across the one-minute time interval.
- **Cleanup Period:** Before cleanup, we have a 5-minute break to ensure that the last responses can arrive before we withdraw the prefix. After the break, we withdraw the announcements in every upstream, see Scenario T3. To allow BGP to converge and minimize the risk of BGP Route Flap Damping, we wait for 30 minutes before starting a new iteration.

**Timeline and Configuration Scenarios:**

- **T1: Announce P without prepending.**
- **T2: Announce P with X prepends.**
- **T3: Withdraw P.**
