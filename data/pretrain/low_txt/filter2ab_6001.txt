**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Code Signing

Adversaries may create, acquire, or steal code signing materials to sign their malware or tools. Code signing provides a level of authenticity, ensuring that the binary originates from the purported developer and has not been tampered with. The certificates used in these operations can be created, acquired, or stolen by the adversary. Unlike the technique of using an invalid code signature, this activity results in a valid and trusted signature.
