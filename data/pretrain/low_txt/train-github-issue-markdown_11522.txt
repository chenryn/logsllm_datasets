After being prompted to install an update and choosing to restart Visual Studio Code (VSCode), I encountered the following error message:

> The setup files are corrupted. Please obtain a new copy of the program.

Here are the details:
- Version: 0.10.3
- Commit: `783ecf8`
- Date: 2015-11-26T14:06:31.538Z
- Shell: 0.34.1
- Renderer: 45.0.2454.85
- Node: 4.1.1

I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling VSCode, but the issue persists. I still encounter the same error when attempting to update.
