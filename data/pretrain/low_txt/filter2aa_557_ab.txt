# DHCP Attacks and Mitigation Strategies
© 2015 Ronny L. Bull - Clarkson University

## Rogue DHCP Server
- **Condition**: A rogue DHCP server is introduced into a network, competing with the legitimate DHCP server to respond to client addressing requests.
- **Impact**: There is a 50/50 chance that a client will associate with the malicious server since client requests are broadcast to the entire network. The presence of multiple rogue DHCP servers further reduces the likelihood of clients connecting to the legitimate server.
- **Ease of Setup**: Setting up a rogue DHCP server on an existing system is straightforward and can be completed in minutes.

## Duplicate Addressing
- **Condition**: Two DHCP servers provide addresses within the same range (e.g., 10.1.2.100 – 10.1.2.200) to clients on the same network.
- **Impact**: There is a high probability of duplicate addressing, leading to conflicts. For example, both DHCP servers might allocate the same IP address (e.g., 10.1.2.100) to different clients.
- **Consequences**:
  - Denial of Service for the clients that receive the same IP address.
  - Services provided by these clients become inaccessible to other systems on the network.
  - Clients are unable to access network resources due to the IP conflict.

## Rogue DNS Server
- **Condition**: A malicious DHCP server provides clients with the IP address of a poisoned DNS server. This poisoned DNS server redirects clients to spoofed websites or services.
- **Impact**: 
  - Client systems are directed to malicious services designed to steal information or deploy malware, such as viruses, worms, and trojans.
  - Personal Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive data is harvested by the attacker.

## Incorrect Default Gateway
- **Condition**: A malicious DHCP server provides an incorrect default gateway IP address to associated clients.
- **Impact**:
  - Clients are unable to route traffic outside their broadcast domain.
  - They cannot access other subnets or the Internet.

## Malicious Honeynet
- **Condition**: A malicious DHCP server directs clients to a malicious default gateway, which routes traffic to a honeynet set up by the attacker.
- **Impact**:
  - Client traffic is captured and analyzed in the honeynet, allowing the attacker to harvest PII or other sensitive information.

## Remote Execution of Code
- **Condition**: By leveraging certain DHCP options, clients can be forced to run code or commands while acquiring or renewing a DHCP lease.
- **Impact**:
  - Remote commands or code can be executed with root privileges.
  - Potential actions range from harmless (e.g., setting the system banner) to catastrophic (e.g., deleting all files and folders on the system).

## DHCP Attack Test Environment
- **Setup**: The test environment used in previous MAC flooding experiments was utilized, with four new virtual machines created in each platform to simulate various attack scenarios.
- **Scenarios**:
  - **Remote Execute of Code**: Commands like `dhcp-option-force=100,() { :; }; /bin/echo 'Testing shellshock vulnerability. If you can read this it worked!'>/tmp/shellshock` and `id` were passed to verify root privileges.
  - **Poisoned DNS Server**: The DHCP server was configured to direct clients to a malicious web server spoofing popular domains like gmail.com.
  - **Invalid Default Gateway**: Clients were given an invalid default gateway address (e.g., 1.1.1.1).
  - **Malicious Default Gateway**: Clients were directed to a malicious default gateway (e.g., 192.168.1.20) that routed traffic to a honeynet.

## Monitoring DHCP Traffic
- **Configuration**:
  - 192.168.1.2: Legitimate DHCP Server
  - 192.168.1.3: Rogue DHCP Server
- **Tools and Configurations**:
  - `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` entry on the server.
  - Output of `dhclient` on the client.

## DHCP Attack Demos
- **Poisoned DNS Server**: [YouTube Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIH51udAZt0)
- **Initial Shellshock Test (write file to /tmp)**: [YouTube Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3ft-tt0N3M)
- **Shellshock Exploit (full root access)**: [YouTube Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdL_6XF1w3o)

## DHCP Attack Mitigation
- **Static IP Addressing**: Enforce static IP addresses, DNS entries, and default gateways on every device, though this method is cumbersome and prone to errors.
- **DHCP Snooping**: Utilize DHCP snooping on switches to restrict network access to specific MAC addresses connected to specific switch ports. This feature is available on some physical switches (e.g., Cisco, HP).
- **DHCP Server Authorization**: Use DHCP server authorization features in Windows 2000 and later, which are part of Active Directory and Windows DHCP servers.
- **Software Defined Networking (SDN)**: Explore SDN techniques to define filters that identify DHCP client requests and forward them to the correct server.

## SELinux and DHCP Attacks
- **SELinux Enabled (Default in CentOS & RedHat)**: SELinux had limited impact on most attacks but prevented writing to directories without 777 permissions when enabled. It allowed writing to `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` but not to `/root`, `/`, `/etc/`, or `/home/xxx`. When disabled, the attack could write files anywhere on the system as the root user.

## Looking Ahead: VLAN Hopping Attacks
- **Next Step**: Evaluate VLAN security in virtualized environments.
- **VLANs in Virtualized Networks**: All virtual switch products support the creation of VLANs, which allow service providers to logically separate and isolate multi-tenant virtual networks.
- **Potential Vulnerabilities**: Investigate if known vulnerabilities in commonly used VLAN protocols apply to virtualized networks, potentially enabling eavesdropping, packet injection, DoS attacks, and covert channels.

## Conclusion
- **Layer 2 Vulnerabilities**: All Layer 2 vulnerabilities discussed targeted virtual networking devices, not the hypervisors themselves.
- **Results**: Virtual networking devices can be just as vulnerable as their physical counterparts. Further research and experimentation are necessary to find more similarities.
- **Specific Findings**:
  - XenServer and solutions using Open vSwitch are vulnerable to eavesdropping out of the box.
  - All environments are vulnerable to manipulation via the DHCP protocol out of the box.
- **Significant Threat**: A single malicious virtual machine can sniff all traffic passing over a virtual switch, affecting physically connected devices and compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of data in a virtualized multi-tenant environment.

## Take-Away Actions
- **User Empowerment**: Users should understand which virtual switch implementations are vulnerable to different Layer 2 network attacks.
- **Security Measures**:
  - Question providers about their hosting environment.
  - Audit the risk of workloads in the cloud or multi-tenant virtualized environments.
  - Consider additional security measures like increased encryption, service monitoring, threat detection, and alerting.
