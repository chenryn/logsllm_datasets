When will an official build of TensorFlow, compatible with the latest release and supporting OpenCL-enabled graphics cards, be available? 

Should I consider forking a version and then attempt to contribute it back to the project? Is this something the core TensorFlow team is interested in pursuing? I have an NVIDIA-equipped iMac that is over three years old, and I am unable to accelerate my computations for various projects. What can I expect in terms of support for OpenCL within the next year?
