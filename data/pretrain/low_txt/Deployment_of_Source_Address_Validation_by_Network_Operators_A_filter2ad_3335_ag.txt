### Appendix A: Notification Text

#### A. Direct Notifications – Baseline

**Subject:** Possible IP spoofing from AS X

We are security researchers from Delft University of Technology. We have conducted a test to detect potential IP spoofing.

**DETECTED ISSUE:** We have observed that your network may be allowing IP spoofing. You can check the test results at: [LINK]

**WHAT TO DO:** We encourage you to deploy Source Address Validation (BCP38) in your network today: https://www.manrs.org/isps/guide/antispoofing/

**HOW TO VALIDATE:** Please run the Spoofer tool to validate if BCP38 was implemented correctly: https://www.caida.org/projects/spoofer/#software

**CONTACT:** If you have any questions, concerns, issues, or comments, please send an email to infospoofing@tudelft.nl.

#### B. Direct Notification – Social Nudge

**Subject:** Possible IP spoofing from AS X

We are security researchers from Delft University of Technology. We have conducted a test to detect potential IP spoofing.

We are security researchers from Delft University of Technology. We have conducted a test to detect potential IP spoofing.

We have observed that certain network operators in your country may be allowing IP spoofing. You can check the test results at: [LINK]

We encourage you to recommend those operators to deploy Source Address Validation (BCP38) in their network.

For your convenience, we tailored a draft of the notification for the network operators. This draft has been tested for clarity and comprehension and has been validated by experts. We highly recommend including this draft in your notification to the network operators.

#### G. NOG Notification

CAIDA’s source address validation measurement project (https://spoofer.caida.org) is automatically generating monthly reports of ASes originating prefixes in BGP for systems from which we received packets with a spoofed source address.

We are publishing these reports to network and security operations lists to ensure this information reaches operational contacts in these ASes. This report summarizes tests conducted within [COUNTRY].

**Inferred improvements during [DATE]:**

| ASN | Name | Fixed by |
|-----|------|----------|
| ASNX | ASN NAME | DATE |

Further information for the inferred remediation is available at: https://spoofer.caida.org/remedy.php

**Source Address Validation issues inferred using Spoofer tool during [DATE]:**

| ASN | Name | First-Spoofed | Last-Spoofed |
|-----|------|---------------|--------------|
| ASNX | ASN NAME | DATE | DATE |

Further information for these tests where we received spoofed packets using Spoofer is available at: https://spoofer.caida.org/recent_tests.php?country_include=ccc,ccc&no_block=1

**Source Address Validation issues inferred using misconfigured open resolvers during [DATE]:**

| ASN | Name | First-Spoofed | Last-Spoofed |
|-----|------|---------------|--------------|
| ASNX | ASN NAME | DATE | DATE |

Further information for these tests where we received spoofed packets using open resolver is available at: [LINK]

Please send any feedback or suggestions to spoofer-info@caida.org.
