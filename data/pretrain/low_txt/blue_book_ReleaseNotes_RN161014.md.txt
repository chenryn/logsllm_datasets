### New Features (Preview):
- **Subscription Security:**
  - **Azure Security Center (ASC) Configuration:** A new PowerShell module has been added to help configure ASC for a subscription, according to predefined policies and information such as contact email and phone number for alerts and incident response.

- **Dev/CICD Kit:**
  - **SVT Module:** A new module has been introduced to verify the secure configuration and usage of Logic Apps.

### Improvements and Fixes:
- **Subscription Security:**
  - **Alert/ARM Policy Enhancements:**
    - **Alerts for ARM Policy Violations:** We have added the capability to receive alerts for ARM policy violations. However, we observed that a significant amount of internal (background) activity from Azure triggers these alerts. As a result, we have temporarily disabled this feature and will provide feedback to the Product Group.
    - **Centralized Policy/Rules Storage:** The alert module now references policy rules stored in a central location (a "read-only" storage blob within an ISRM subscription). This enhancement allows for updates to the rules without the need to re-download or reinstall the DevOps kit.
    - **Other Improvements:** Various minor enhancements have been made, including improvements to package setup and warning messages.

- **SS-Health:**
  - **Service Principal Usage Check:** A new check has been added to monitor the use of service principals across resource groups. This will help mitigate the risk of using a DevTest principal in a production resource group and vice versa.
  - **RBAC Health Check Remediation:** Support has been added for remediating and correcting issues flagged during RBAC health checks.

- **Dev/CICD Kit:**
  - **SVT Enhancements:**
    - **Service Fabric SVT Module:** Additional control checks have been added to the Service Fabric SVT module.
    - **Column Renaming:** SVT report columns have been renamed to be more intuitive.
    - **App Service Module Fixes:** Issues reported in the App Service module have been resolved.
