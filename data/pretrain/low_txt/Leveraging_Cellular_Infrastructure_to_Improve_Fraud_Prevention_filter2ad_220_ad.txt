### Key Generation and User Acceptance

When users download FrauVent, a symmetric key can be generated and established between the two parties through an initial pairing or registration process. The widespread adoption of an application such as FrauVent hinges on user acceptance. Specifically, a broad range of users must feel comfortable interacting with their bank through the provided interfaces. From a usability perspective, our work represents a significant advancement over previous efforts by leveraging the increasingly rich interfaces available on mobile phones. However, several issues remain. For example, we have yet to determine the "ideal" range of the map presented to a user. While the current interface allows users to zoom out if the view is too restrictive, we believe that automatically displaying the right amount of geographic detail will enhance user acceptance. To achieve this, we are currently planning a large-scale user acceptance test with a major US financial institution, involving actual customers. We believe that such a study requires its own dedicated research effort and thus leave it for future work.

### Security and Localization

Our protocol currently requires cellular providers to sign approximations of user locations. This step aims to provide banks with third-party corroboration of location information, thereby preventing various attacks, such as GPS jamming. In our deployment, we use the WhereAmI infrastructure to approximate these steps. However, such localization and subsequent signatures may be considered too expensive by providers. Eliminating this step could potentially risk the client's ability to reliably detect its location. We leave the determination of the risk associated with such an attack to the provider considering cooperation with the deployment of FrauVent.

### Addressing Other Issues

There are several other issues that we have not yet addressed. Malware targeting mobile devices is becoming increasingly important. Devices that lack even basic security mechanisms, such as memory protection, are at risk of being compromised. We argue that using techniques like the process isolation provided by Android's Dalvik virtual machine can help reduce such threats. However, solving the problem of mobile malware is explicitly beyond the scope of this work.

### Enhancing Mobile Authentication

Finally, we believe that this work makes an important step towards making mobile phones into more generally applicable authentication tokens. While we are not the first to suggest this, the majority of solutions simply use the cellular infrastructure to deliver unauthenticated messages. Our scheme attempts to provide strong guarantees and leverage the strengths of this infrastructure—its ubiquity, processing power, and location awareness—to create a framework for more secure interactions.

### Conclusion

The cost of stolen financial credentials is becoming increasingly burdensome for both consumers and industries. Although many two-factor authentication systems have been proposed to address these issues, none have been widely adopted for various reasons. In this paper, we present FrauVent, an application designed to take advantage of the emerging set of expressive interfaces available on mobile phones to provide users with the context necessary to approve or reject suspicious transactions. We used a combination of protocol design, formal verification, and a small-scale deployment on Android phones to demonstrate the potential of our approach. We believe that this initial framework provides an important step towards effectively leveraging cellular infrastructure to improve the physical security of sensitive information.
