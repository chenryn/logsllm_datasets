### 6. UNDERSTANDING BLOCKLISTS USAGE

To better understand how network operators use blocklists to identify and mitigate malicious traffic, we conducted a survey of 65 network operators (see Appendix A for the full survey). The survey focused on three key areas: the use of blocklists to identify malicious traffic, the role of blocklists in traffic filtering, and the perceived limitations of blocklists due to IP address reuse.

**Survey Findings:**
- **Usage of Blocklists:** 85% of respondents reported using blocklists.
- **Direct Blocking:** 59% of respondents use blocklists to directly block malicious traffic (Table 1).
- **Impact of Reused Addresses:**
  - 34 participants provided specific feedback on the impact of reused addresses.
  - 56% of these respondents believe that blocklists are inaccurate due to Network Address Translation (NAT).
  - 76% of respondents believe that dynamic addressing introduces inaccuracies.

From the responses and open-ended comments, it is clear that network operators are aware of the potential for unjust blocking caused by reused IP addresses. 

### 7. CONCLUSION

In this study, we presented two techniques for identifying reused IP addresses and analyzed 151 publicly available IPv4 blocklists to quantify their impact. Our key findings include:
- **Prevalence of Reused Addresses:** 53–60% of blocklists list at least one reused address.
- **Number of Listings:** We found 30.6K–45.1K listings of reused addresses in blocklists.
- **Duration and Impact:** Reused addresses can remain in blocklists for up to 44 days, affecting as many as 78 users.

To assist blocklist maintainers in reducing unjust blocking, we have made our discovered reused addresses public. This resource can be used in various ways:
- **Traffic Filtering:** Depending on the type of blocklist, network operators can take appropriate action on incoming traffic. For example, DDoS blocklists may require blocking all listed traffic, even if there is collateral damage due to reused addresses. In contrast, application-specific blocklists (e.g., spam blocklists) that require higher accuracy can use our list to implement greylisting, which is already built into popular spam filtering systems like Spamassassin [74] or Spamd [14].
- **Maintaining Accuracy:** Our lists can provide incentives for blocklist maintainers to improve the accuracy of their blocklists. They may choose to identify and list malicious reused IP addresses in a separate greylist.
- **User Notifications:** Services such as Google or Cloudflare can use our lists to warn users that their IP address has been reused by a compromised device, helping them to clean up their home networks or seek assistance from their Internet Service Provider (ISP).
