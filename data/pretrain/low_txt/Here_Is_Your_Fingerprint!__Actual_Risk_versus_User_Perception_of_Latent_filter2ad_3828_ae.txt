### Considerations for Touch ID and Mitigation Strategies

Certain fingers, such as the little finger, are rarely or never used on touch screens. Requiring dual-finger authentication for Touch ID could be a potential solution, but it may introduce behavioral challenges. A more preferred technical mitigation method is the use of under-screen Touch ID with a slide bar.

### 7. Conclusions

In this paper, we presented the SCRAP attack and conducted both experimental and user-survey studies to examine the gap between the actual risk and user perception of latent fingerprints left on smartphones. We demonstrated that the SCRAP attack poses a real risk, while user awareness of this threat is low. We also discussed various mitigation methods.

As shown in Figure 17 in Appendix I, it is possible to unlock Touch ID with a much smaller portion of a fingerprint, suggesting that our attack's success rate could be higher than the results presented in this paper. Additionally, the combination method can be generalized to use more than one matched fingerprint image. In future studies, we plan to replace the current fingerprint collection method (photography) with an easier scanning process and examine the entire area of the touchscreen to find portions with better quality. A large-scale study is also promising.

### Summary of Fingerprint Forgery Attacks on Smartphones

In Section 2, we described fingerprint forgery attacks on smartphone touch sensors, as disclosed by various parties in public videos, such as those on YouTube. These attacks are summarized in Table 4.

### B. Photographic Setting

In our experiments, the smartphone was placed on a workbench 74 cm high from the ground. The angle between the camera lens and the smartphone was set at 60 degrees, and the distance was 15 cm, which was 10 cm closer than [2] to reduce reflection and diffusion in full close-up photography. The light, 174 cm high, was placed at a vertical angle of 35 degrees (i.e., the light illuminated the smartphone at a 55-degree angle) with a distance of 178 cm from the smartphone surface, and a horizontal angle of 12 degrees. This setup was chosen as the default because it performed best in our pilot study (Figure 12).

### C. SIFT Descriptor-Based Exact Matching

For fingerprint smudge matching in Section 3.3, we performed SIFT descriptor-based brute-force matching on H and Ti. This step was necessary for selecting Ts, which was closest to H. Subsequently, we had to perform SIFT descriptor-based exact matching on H and Ts because they were taken from different locations: H from the home button and Ts from somewhere on the touchscreen. The conceptual procedure of the SIFT descriptor-based exact matching is shown in Figure 13. H and Ts, which were already SIFT-matched, are overlapped based on the shortest matched descriptors (denoted as blue dots). We observed a slight difference between the second shortest matched descriptors, denoted as blue and yellow circles in Figure 13-(a). This difference may affect the fingerprint ridges between H and Ts, necessitating correction. In this example, we achieve the exact match by fixing the difference based on the SIFT descriptors, as shown in Figure 13-(b).

### D. Inner Area of Home Button

We define the inner area of H as the blocks marked with yellow circles (Hu) and × marks (Hd) in Figure 14. The inner area refers to the blocks free from the Ring of Touch ID. bH inner in Algorithm 2 is the number of blocks in the inner area, fixed at 52. nH inner is the number of blocks with more keypoints than τ, i.e., the number of blocks marked with circles in Figure 14. In our example in Section 3, nH inner = 26. The threshold value 0.6 of nH inner / bH inner in Algorithm 2 was set due to the possibility of half-submission success, as shown in Figure 17-(c).

### E. Smudge Photography Examples

In Section 4, we described our attack experiments in various realistic scenarios. Example snapshots are shown in Figure 15.

### F. In-Person Survey Materials

#### In-person Interaction Script

1. **Introduction:**
   - Introduce yourself, your affiliation, and provide an overview of the study: "The purpose of this survey is to investigate how users interact with iPhones, particularly Touch ID. We aim to understand which fingertips are used for touching both Touch ID and the touchscreen, and how you perceive Touch ID and latent fingerprints remaining on your iPhone. This survey should only be taken by users whose iPhone supports Touch ID. Your responses are completely anonymous and will be destroyed after the experiment. The Yonsei University Institutional Review Board (IRB) has approved the use of human participants for this survey. It will take approximately 10 minutes. Please feel free to provide any comments and feedback."

2. **Consent Form:**
   - After the participant reads and agrees to the consent form, verify that the participant has an iPhone that supports Touch ID (iPhone 5S, 6, 6 Plus, 6S, and 6S Plus).

3. **Survey Completion:**
   - After the participant completes the survey, conduct a selective interview (short semi-structured) with participants who provided interesting or unusual answers. The interview takes less than 20 minutes.

4. **Verification and Gratitude:**
   - Verify enrolled fingerprints and unlocking actions for four scenarios and hand the participant a small gratuity ($10). If the participant also completed the selective interview, provide an additional $10 for their participation.
