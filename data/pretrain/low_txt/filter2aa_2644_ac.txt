A comprehensive set of network drawings must be developed and maintained using highly confidential methods. These drawings should include every connection using routable and non-routable protocols to all cyber devices, as defined by the site. Connections typically include Ethernet, serial, fiber, USB, proprietary protocols, wireless, and printer connections. Common devices include Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Distributed Control Systems (DCS), process recorders, computers, servers, media converters, external storage, controllers, thin clients, Keyboard Video Mouse (KVM) switches, Ethernet switches, routers, hubs, and any device with an Ethernet connection.

Prior to developing these drawings, it is essential to define symbology, line types, borders, and other graphical elements. Refer to Section 7. Appendix A: Examples for more details.

### 4.3.3. Procedure 1: Policies

This procedure serves as the master document, outlining associated procedures and requirements common to all cybersecurity practices. The master document should include:

- **Overview of Scope, Approach, and Commitment to Cybersecurity**: A clear statement of the organization's dedication to maintaining robust cybersecurity measures.
- **Cybersecurity Team**: Roles, responsibilities, and contact information for team members.
- **Employee Accountability Statement**: A declaration of employee responsibility in upholding cybersecurity standards.
- **References**: Governing standards and guidance documents.
- **Issuance and Update Policies for Procedures**: Guidelines for creating, updating, and distributing cybersecurity procedures.
- **Processes for Initiating, Documenting, and Closing Exceptions to Policies**: Documented exceptions should always require compensating measures to mitigate any added risk.
- **Exception Review Policies**: Conditions for exceptions and the review process.
- **Identification, Classification, and Categorization Policies and Processes**: Methods for identifying, classifying, and categorizing assets.
- **Personnel Security Training Requirements, Processes, and Policies**: Training programs and policies for employees.
- **Introductions/Overviews of Associated Procedures**: Summaries of related procedures.
- **Periodic Reviews of All Policies**: Regular assessments to ensure policies remain effective and up-to-date.

Applying consistent security management controls across the organization is more cost-effective in both the short and long term than implementing multiple sets of controls for different sub-entities.

### 4.3.4. Procedure 2: Information Protection

It is crucial that only individuals with a need to know are allowed to view sensitive information, regardless of the medium. This procedure should provide the necessary processes to ensure this happens.

#### 4.3.4.1. Information Management Controls

- **Policies, Process, and Reporting Requirements for Information Loss or Theft**: Guidelines for handling and reporting data breaches.
- **Data Retention Requirements**: All data should be retained electronically, indefinitely, and well-organized.
- **Policies for Determining the Sensitive Nature of Information and Subsequent Controls Through Assessments**: Criteria for classifying information and applying appropriate controls.
- **Individuals Responsible for Access Authorization**: Designated personnel for managing access rights.

#### 4.3.4.2. Information Access Controls

- **User Management Policies**: Information access control lists and policies for adding, removing, and modifying user rights.
- **Authorization Process for Access Rights**: Procedures for granting and revoking access.
- **Personnel Risk Assessments/Background Checks**: Evaluations to ensure the trustworthiness of individuals with access to sensitive information.

#### 4.3.4.3. Sensitive/Top Secret Information

Organizations should have specific policies for classifying and protecting sensitive/top secret information, including:

- **Operational Procedures and Lists**
- **Network Topology and Similar Diagrams, Floor Plans of Computing Centers, Equipment Layouts**
- **Disaster Recovery/Incident Response Plans**
- **Security Configuration Information**

Information must be protected from initial plant design to plant shutdown and abandonment. If network information is leaked, the only effective mitigation is to redesign the network or enhance certain security controls.

### 4.3.5. Procedure 3: Physical Security Plan

This procedure should define the physical access controls, monitoring, and user management policies of the organization, providing the first and last lines of defense against local cyber attacks and physical destruction of systems.

#### 4.3.5.1. Physical Security Perimeters (PSPs)

- **PSP Design Requirements**: A layered approach is recommended, using primary, secondary, and tertiary PSPs.
- **Requirements for Protection of Physical Access Points to PSPs**: Two-factor authentication is recommended at each PSP access point.

#### 4.3.5.2. Physical Security Controls

- **Policies and Tools to Monitor, Log, and Alert Attempts at Unauthorized Physical Access and Breaches**: Continuous monitoring and logging of access points.
- **Incident Response Plan for Physical Security Breaches and Reporting Requirements**: Procedures for responding to and reporting security breaches.
- **Physical Enclosures with Physical Access Warnings**: Secure enclosures with clear signage (e.g., "Authorized Personnel Only").
- **Acceptable Physical Security Controls**: Keys/locks, RFID readers, biometric systems, cameras, etc.

#### 4.3.5.3. Physical Access Controls

- **User Management Policies**: Physical access control lists and policies for adding, removing, and modifying user rights.
- **Levels of Physical Access**: Restricted, escorted, unescorted, visitor, or unrestricted, with conditions for membership.
- **Policies and Tools to Monitor and Log Authorized Physical Access**: Historical audit trails should be kept indefinitely.
- **Pass, ID, Keys, and Locks Management and Response to Loss or Tampering**: Procedures for managing and securing physical access credentials.

This procedure is closely tied to Procedure 5, Change Control and Configuration Management. Any changes to the physical security of cyber assets will require meeting the requirements of both procedures.

### 4.3.6. Procedure 4: Electronic Security Plan

This procedure should define the electronic access controls, monitoring, and user management policies of the organization, providing the first and last lines of defense against remote and local cyber attacks.

#### 4.3.6.1. Electronic Security Perimeters (ESPs)

- **ESP Design Requirements**: A layered approach is recommended, using primary, secondary, and tertiary ESPs, with a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to isolate the Primary ESP from untrusted networks.
- **Requirements for Protection of Electronic Access Points to ESPs**: Two-factor authentication is recommended at each ESP access point.

#### 4.3.6.2. Electronic Security Controls

- **Policies and Tools to Monitor, Log, and Alert Attempts at Unauthorized Electronic Access and Actual Breaches**: Continuous monitoring and logging of access points.
- **Incident Response Plan for Electronic Security Breaches and Reporting Requirements**: Procedures for responding to and reporting security breaches.
- **Network Security Controls**: Encryption, authentication, password/username policies, firewalls, network and device design requirements, backup and recovery infrastructure, and security assessments.
- **Device Security Controls**: Security settings, hardening plans, software verification, firewall use, and digital media policies.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Processes for generating, validating, and recovering backups, and requirements for media and backup systems.

#### 4.3.6.3. Electronic Access Controls

- **Policies and Tools to Monitor and Log Authorized Electronic Access**: Historical audit trails should be kept indefinitely.
- **Personnel, Domain, Login, and Fair Use Banner Policies**: Guidelines for user behavior and system usage.

This procedure is closely tied to Procedure 5, Change Control and Configuration Management. Any changes to the electronic security of cyber assets will require meeting the requirements of both procedures.

### 4.3.7. Procedure 5: Change Control and Configuration Management

It is essential to have semi-automated management systems in place to track configuration data. Manual surveys and walk-downs have proven to be less cost-effective compared to automated systems. This procedure should include the following main points.

#### 4.3.7.1. Asset Management

- **Tracking Network Changes**: All changes to the network must be tracked on lists, drawings, databases, and other current data sources.
- **Roles and Responsibilities for Authorization of Changes**: Clear definitions of who can authorize changes.
- **Policies for New Devices or Disposal/Relocation of Hardware**: Guidelines for managing new and existing hardware.

#### 4.3.7.2. Configuration Management

- **Tracking Configuration and Logic Changes**: All changes to cyber devices must be tracked indefinitely via Operations & Maintenance (O&M) activities.
- **Policies for Tracking, Protecting, and Storing Configuration Data**: Systematic and electronic management of data to improve security.
- **Required and Recommended Configuration Data**: Open ports, installed programs and services, security settings, hardware configurations, and other pertinent data.
- **Process for Hardware Upgrades, Software Changes, and Version Upgrades**: Guidelines for updating operating systems, logic/graphics, firmware, vendor releases, and security patches.
- **Patch Management, Testing, and Rollout**: Procedures for testing and deploying patches and updates.
- **Devices Requiring Configuration Management**: Typically, DCS, PLCs, HMIs, PCs/servers, switches, routers, hubs, and devices with Ethernet, serial, modem, or USB ports.

#### 4.3.7.3. Change Process

- **Change Requests, Implementation, and Testing**: Changes may result from vulnerability identification, patch releases, or functional needs.
- **Plan for Implementing and Testing Changes**: Changes should be tested in-lab before field implementation and after field implementation.
- **Process for Initiating, Reviewing, Approving, Authorizing, Implementing, and Testing Changes**: Reviews should be approved by authorized personnel, and sufficient backups should be maintained for rollback if needed.

Configurations should be validated periodically (at least daily) to ensure they have not been changed inadvertently or without authorization. Automation is essential for this task.

### 4.3.8. Design Guides

Design guides should provide guidelines for effective implementation of security systems based on industry best practices and lessons learned. They should be written when a specific need is identified and should not list hard requirements but rather offer practical advice.

### 4.4. Recommendations for a True Defense-in-Depth Approach

Section 4.3 focuses on documentation, records, and the audit trail. This section provides a comprehensive rundown of the recommended methods, techniques, and tools for complying with the policies outlined in the previous section. These methods were developed over a year, ensuring compliance with the standards discussed earlier. New processes should be integrated into existing ones, such as the site's Corrective Action Program (CAP).

#### 4.4.1. Identification, Classification, and Categorization

Existing documentation, such as connection diagrams and network diagrams, may be incomplete or inaccurate. Field verification is necessary before using them in a new compliance effort. It is assumed that the organization has already developed a network diagram, sites, systems, and a device list.

**Classification of Sites, Systems, and Devices:**

- **Sites**: Classified by importance to operations and the risk of long-term widespread impact on other facilities.
- **Systems**: Classified by importance to plant operation, worst-case downtime, and likelihood of attack.
- **Devices**: Classified by importance to operation and control, likelihood of attack, and ease of attack.

Classification of sites should be completed before systems and devices. Systems and devices will inherit some requirements from the sites. This classification will help determine which assets should be addressed first and which should be most protected, aiding in yearly funding decisions.

**Recommended Classification Scheme:**

- **Sites**:
  - **Q0 - Severity of Attack**: Does the asset, if compromised, impact the reliability of the Bulk Electric System? Can the consequences of a cyber attack spread beyond the target site?
    - **Level 2 (Non-Critical Site)**: Well-protected site, eventually.
    - **Level 1 (Critical Site)**: Highly protected site, addressed first.

- **Systems**:
  - **Q1 - Likeliness of Attack**: Does the system include cyber devices?
  - **Q2 - Severity of Attack**: Does the system directly support the reliable operation of the plant?

Examples of common systems at different types of plants (e.g., coal, nuclear) are provided. Precise methodology for determining the critical nature of a site is still evolving, but factors such as peak load generation, availability, and integrity should be considered.
