### Overview
This presentation will use the preparation/attack/response model to discuss the types of legal attacks that can threaten your IT infrastructure. We will explore how to protect yourself, your organization, and your users from these threats.

---

### Types of Legal Attacks
Legal methods can be used as IT infrastructure attacks, often with similar aims to traditional cyber-attacks:
- **Shutdown**: 
  - **Injunctions**: Similar to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, an injunction can force the shutdown of services.
- **Information Access**:
  - **Database Intrusion**: Unauthorized access to your data.
  - **Subpoenas**: Court orders to produce information or testify.

#### Precautions
- **Offsite Backups**: Essential for recovery in case of destructive search warrant execution or natural disasters.
- **Strong Searching & Archiving Solutions**: Useful for responding to discovery orders and preventing redundant storage.

### Types of Legal Attacks
- **Search Warrants**
- **Subpoenas**
- **Discovery Requests**
- **Wiretaps**
- **Transitive Trust Attacks**

---

### Search Warrants
- **Fourth Amendment, U.S. Constitution**:
  - "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."

- **Requirements for a Search Warrant**:
  - Issued by a neutral judicial officer.
  - Based on probable cause that a crime has occurred and evidence is present.
  - Supported by a signed, written affidavit.
  - Specific about the items and areas to be searched.

- **Execution of a Search Warrant**:
  - Allows seizure of named items, contraband, and evidence.
  - For computers, data or the entire device can be seized at the discretion of law enforcement.

- **Preparation for a Search Warrant**:
  - **IT Defenses**:
    - Multiple site backups, preferably in different jurisdictions.
    - Automatic failover systems.
  - **Legal Defenses**:
    - Minimize damage during execution.
    - Do not interfere; cooperate fully.
  - **Post-Execution**:
    - Exclude evidence from invalid warrants (Leon rule).
    - Restore operations from backups.

- **Warrantless Searches**:
  - Generally require probable cause, with exceptions such as:
    - Search incident to lawful arrest.
    - Automobile searches.
    - Regulatory searches (e.g., border crossings, airports).

### Wiretaps
- **Requirements**:
  - Must be authorized by a warrant under 18 USC ยง2510 et seq.
  - Must specify the target and not capture innocent traffic.
- **CALEA (Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act)**:
  - Providers must enable government interception of targeted communications.
  - Intercepted transmissions must be in a format transportable to the government.
  - Government cannot specify provider equipment or specifications.

- **Defenses**:
  - **IT**:
    - Strong encryption with limited distribution of private keys.
    - ISP/provider encryption can be compelled under CALEA.
    - Grand Jury subpoenas can compel key holders to divulge keys.
  - **Legal**:
    - Challenge the warrant if there is no probable cause or other flaws.
    - Seek suppression of evidence if innocent communications are captured.

### Subpoenas
- **Types**:
  - **Subpoena Duces Tecum (SDT)**: Order to produce documents or information.
  - **Subpoena Ad Testificandum (SAT)**: Order to testify under oath.

- **Protection and Limits**:
  - No right against self-incrimination in civil or regulatory issues.
  - Right against self-incrimination must be expressly invoked in criminal cases.
  - No undue burden or expense on the recipient.
  - No privileged material.
  - Not for harassment or improper purpose.

- **Enforcement**:
  - Civil contempt (fines or jail time until compliance).

- **Defenses**:
  - **IT**:
    - Mitigation: Easily searchable indexes and clear data retention policies.
    - Stonewalling: Compartmentalization and black holes.
  - **Legal**:
    - Motion to Quash: Argue burden, privilege, or trade secret.
    - Protective order: Limit the scope of the subpoena.

### Discovery
- **Requirements**:
  - Filed lawsuit.
  - Automatic disclosure required under FRCP 26(a)(1)(B).
  - Disclosure of Electronically Stored Information (ESI) locations and types.
  - Can protect from actual delivery if undue burden or cost (FRCP 26(b)(2)(B)).

- **Defenses**:
  - **IT**:
    - Quick, efficient, and complete location and retrieval of responsive information.
    - Determine costs and burdens of recovery.
    - Enforce document retention and destruction policies.
  - **Legal**:
    - Oppose discovery orders by showing costs and burdens.
    - Use pre-discovery efforts to quantify and restrict the duty to turn over information.
    - Assist with specifying incoming and outgoing discovery.
    - Counter-attack by challenging the other side's compliance.

- **Collaboration**:
  - Effective collaboration between IT and legal teams is crucial.
  - Misunderstandings can lead to sanctions and overly broad litigation holds.

### Transitive Trust Attacks
- **Definition**:
  - Attacker probes for the weakest link in a chain of trust.
  - If B and C share datum i, control of i depends on the weaker of B or C from the attacker's perspective.

- **Examples**:
  - **New Jersey v. Ceres (2005)**: 'Perverted Justice' method acquires screen name and incriminatory chat, then subpoenas AOL for subscriber information.
  - **MySpace, Fyodor, and GoDaddy**: MySpace targets the weak link in the trust chain to get material off the net.

- **Defenses**:
  - Know what information is shared with other organizations.
  - Get agreements to alert you quickly before they must deliver information.
  - Intervene quickly and aggressively as a party in interest.
  - Keep sensitive information in-house when possible.
  - Establish defense agreements for mutual protection.
