In Bootstrap 3.2.0, it is currently possible to have multiple accordion items open simultaneously, although the standard behavior is to allow only one item to be open at a time. Below, I will explain how to reproduce this behavior:

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. **Normal Click**: Click on the accordion item labeled "Collapsible Group Item #3."
2. **Fast Click**: Quickly click on the accordion item labeled "Collapsible Group Item #2."
3. **Immediate Fast Click**: As soon as possible after step 2, click on the accordion item labeled "Collapsible Group Item #1."

### Result:
After following these steps, you will see that two or more accordion items are open simultaneously. The image below illustrates this result:

This behavior can be considered a deviation from the expected functionality of the accordion component in Bootstrap.
