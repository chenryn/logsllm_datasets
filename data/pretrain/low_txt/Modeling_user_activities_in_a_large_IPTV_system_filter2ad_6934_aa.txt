## Abstract
Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) has emerged as a new delivery method for TV, where video streams are encoded in IP packets and distributed using IP unicast and multicast. This architecture is being embraced by ISPs globally, recognizing the potential for new services and a more interactive TV experience. Since user activities like channel switching in IPTV impose additional workload beyond local TV or set-top boxes, it is essential to characterize and model these activities to support system design and performance evaluation. In this work, we analyze real data from an operational nationwide IPTV system to study intrinsic characteristics of user activities. We develop models to capture both the probability distribution and time-dynamics of these activities. These models are combined to create SIMULWATCH, a tool that generates synthetic workload traces mimicking real user behavior. We validate SIMULWATCH using real traces, demonstrating its accuracy in estimating unicast and multicast traffic.

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, telecommunication companies have rapidly deployed IPTV infrastructure and services, which deliver live TV streams via residential broadband networks. This growth is driven by commercial reasons, such as offering triple-play packages, and the potential for new interactive applications. However, a comprehensive understanding of user activities in IPTV systems is lacking, which is crucial for system design and performance evaluation. Without realistic user activity models, researchers often rely on hypothetical models, which can lead to incorrect performance estimations. This paper bridges this gap by developing realistic models based on data from a large operational IPTV network.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Overview of IPTV Architecture
A typical IPTV system (Figure 1) includes:
- **Super Hub Office (SHO):** The primary source of television content, which encodes and transmits video streams to Video Hub Offices (VHOs) via an IP backbone.
- **Video Hub Offices (VHOs):** Each VHO serves a metropolitan area, acquiring local content, processing it, and transmitting it to end users.
- **Residential Gateway (RG):** Connects to a modem and one or more Set-Top Boxes (STBs), managing all data traffic, including live TV, STB control, VoIP, and Internet data.
- **Set-Top Box (STB):** Receives and decodes video streams, controlled by a remote controller, and supports features like DVR, fast-channel-switching, and advanced interactive services.

### 2.2 Data Set
The data used in this study comes from a large U.S. IPTV provider with over one million subscribers and two million STBs across four time zones. The dataset includes anonymous STB logs, control plane messages, network configuration data, and TV channel lists. We analyzed 6 days of data from April 2nd to 7th, 2009, and validated our models using data from April 8th, 2009. Limitations include missing rapid channel switch events, lack of remote controller data, and incomplete information about advanced features.

## 3. Analyzing User Activities
Our goal is to define a mathematical process that mimics IPTV user activities. We start by studying various characteristics of the data traces, focusing on turning STBs on and off, channel switches, and channel popularity.

### 3.1 Turning STBs On and Off
We examine the length of on- and off-sessions. An on-session is the duration from a STB being switched on until it is switched off, while an off-session is the duration from the last time a STB was switched off until it is switched on again.

**Figure 2:** Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of the length of on- and off-sessions. Both on- and off-sessions exhibit long tails, with around 5% of sessions lasting over a day. Off-sessions have a heavier tail, indicating that STBs are more likely to be left off for longer periods.

**Figure 3:** Time series of the number of online STBs, normalized by the average number, showing a strong diurnal pattern with a peak at 9 PM and a minimum at 4 AM.

**Figures 4a and 4b:** One-day time series of the event rate for switching-on and switching-off events, respectively, showing strong time-of-day effects. Switching-on events peak at 7 AM and 9 PM, while switching-off events peak at 7:30 AM and 12 AM.

## 4. Developing Models
We develop a series of models to capture the intrinsic characteristics of user activities:
- **Session Duration:** Mixture exponential distribution for session durations.
- **Time-Varying Nature:** Fourier Transform to model periodically correlated events.
- **Channel Access Popularity:** Zipf-like and exponential distributions for sequential and targeted channel switches.
- **Channel Popularity Dynamics:** Mixture population model for finer time granularity.

## 5. SIMULWATCH: A Workload Generation Tool
SIMULWATCH combines these models to generate synthetic workload traces. It takes a small number of input parameters and outputs traces that mimic real user behavior. We validate SIMULWATCH by comparing synthetic traces with real data, showing close matches even for properties not explicitly modeled. Specifically, SIMULWATCH accurately estimates unicast and multicast traffic bandwidth, making it a useful tool for performance studies in IPTV systems.

## 6. Related Work
We review related work in Section 6, discussing previous studies and their limitations.

## 7. Conclusion
This paper presents an in-depth analysis of user activities in a large IPTV system, develops realistic models, and introduces SIMULWATCH, a tool for generating synthetic workload traces. Our work provides a baseline for understanding and quantifying changes in user viewing patterns as IPTV features evolve.

## 8. Future Work
Future work will focus on extending the models to incorporate advanced IPTV features and further validating the models with additional datasets.
