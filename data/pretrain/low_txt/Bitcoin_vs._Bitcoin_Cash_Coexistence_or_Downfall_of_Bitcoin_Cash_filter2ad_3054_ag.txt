### Merged Mining and Its Challenges

Merged mining is a complex process that requires additional work from miners [53]. An alternative approach to increase the value of Coin B is through price manipulation. However, maintaining an artificially inflated coin price through such means is not well-studied. Another method involves increasing the relative incentive for mining Coin B compared to Coin A. This can be achieved by either increasing the block reward or decreasing the average time required for block generation. While this may help prevent rival coins from stealing loyal miners, it can also lead to side effects such as inflation or an increased fork rate [25, 18].

Additionally, Coin B could change its consensus protocol, moving from a Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism to another protocol. However, this transition would likely not be supported by existing miners, who may leave if they lose their advantages, such as powerful hardware capabilities. For example, Ethereum has been planning to switch from PoW to Proof of Stake (PoS) for several years, but the transition has faced significant challenges.

### Environmental Factors

In practice, miners' behavior can deviate from theoretical models due to various environmental factors:

1. **Rationality of Miners:**
   - Not all miners are rational. Some may not recognize the profitability of fickle mining or switching to Coin A, even if it is more profitable. Our data analysis confirms that most miners are rational, especially those using automatic mining functions, which always follow the most profitable strategy.

2. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Profitability:**
   - Predicting long-term coin prices is challenging [54], so most miners base their decisions on short-term profits. For instance, the hash war between Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV was unpredictable. Therefore, our model considers both rational miners focused on short-term gains and factions (Ωstick) interested in long-term profits.

3. **Stable Coexistence:**
   - Some miners may prefer the stable coexistence of multiple coins for market stability, regardless of their immediate profits. If a significant fraction of miners holds this view, the system might reach an equilibrium state. However, historical observations suggest that this fraction is unlikely to be high in real-world scenarios.

4. **Other Forms of Selfish Mining:**
   - Our study primarily focuses on fickle mining, a type of rational mining. However, miners engaging in other forms of selfish mining [15, 22, 23, 24] may cause deviations from our analysis.

### Conclusion

In this study, we modeled and analyzed the game between two coins for fickle mining. Our results indicate that fickle mining can lead to a lack of loyal miners in the less valued coin system, potentially weakening the overall health of the coin system. We confirmed this through real-world historical data. Additionally, our analysis extended to the impact of automatic mining, which poses a significant risk. As of December 2018, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) loyal miners would leave if more than about 5% of the total mining power in BTC and BCH were involved in automatic mining. Furthermore, we explained how one coin can steal loyal miners from a less valued rival coin in a highly competitive market. This is a serious threat to cryptocurrency systems using a PoW mechanism.
