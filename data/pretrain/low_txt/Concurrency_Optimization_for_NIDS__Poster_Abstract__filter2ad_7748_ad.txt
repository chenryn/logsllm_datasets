### Biomarkers of Lung Cancer and Smoking

Biomarkers of lung cancer are strongly associated with smoking, which can distort the biological interpretation of metabolites and pathways related to smoking. This association does not generalize well to new populations of non-cancer patients. The combination of weighting strategies with popular analytical models (e.g., PLS-DA, generalized linear models with regularization, and random forest) not only leads to statistically valid models with good predictive ability but also ensures that the extracted biomarkers are independent of the primary outcome. In short, the extracted urinary biomarkers were more specifically associated with smoking than with lung cancer status. Consequently, we developed a framework for introducing weights to guide researchers in choosing an appropriate weighting method. Finally, we discuss the application of this framework to metabolomics studies using secondary data.

**Title:** Improving Technologies for High Throughput and Miniaturized Metabolomics for Precision Medicine
**Presenting Author:** Thomas Hankemeier, Leiden University, Netherlands

While genomics has been successful in predicting disease risk, metabolomics can assess the actual health state and monitor disease development and treatment response. Large-scale metabolomics studies are essential for better and more specific prognoses of chronic diseases. Efficient and quantitative metabolomics methods are necessary for this purpose. This lecture will discuss novel technologies, including a hanging droplet evaporator for high throughput (HT) and miniaturized sample preparation, electro-driven sample preparation technologies, and microfluidic-based advanced in-vitro models with organotypic characteristics. These innovations can be used for both HT and miniaturized metabolomics, and their impact on clinical research and decision support will be explored.

Metabolomics holds great potential for discovering unknown biomarkers. Advanced chemical tools are required compared to other 'omics' areas. Recent developments have shown that gut microbiota profoundly impacts human physiology. However, limited information is available on interspecies co-metabolism at the molecular level. We have developed state-of-the-art Chemical Biology techniques, including a unique chemoselective probe immobilized to magnetic beads, for enhanced metabolomics analysis using UPLC-MS/MS. This method allows for facile extraction of metabolites and increased mass spectrometric sensitivity. Additionally, selective enzymatic treatment of metabolites in human samples has led to the identification of three times as many sulfated metabolites as reported in the Human Metabolome Database. These methodologies aim to overcome limitations in mass spectrometry-based metabolomics research and are being applied to discover unknown metabolites in medical samples, such as those for pancreatic cancer.

**Title:** GC×GC-TOFMS and SIFT-MS Approaches for Clinical Breath-Based Asthma Phenotyping
**Presenting Author:** Pierre-Hugues Stefanuto, Liège University, Belgium
**Co-Authors:** Delphine Zanella, Joeri Vercammen, Florence Schleich, Renaud Louis, Jean-François Focant

The rise of analytical technologies has expanded the scope of "omics" screening. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) and single ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) are two orthogonal approaches for pathology screening. While GC×GC-HRTOFMS offers almost complete sample characterization, SIFT-MS provides rapid, targeted and non-targeted analyses. Both methods were compared using breath samples from 50 asthmatic patients. Data were analyzed using identical processing workflows, and both approaches offered similar classification capacities. GC×GC-HRTOFMS allowed for the identification of putative markers, while SIFT-MS provided faster screening.

**Title:** Mathematical Modelling of Metabolism: A Driver for Developing Personalized and Precision Medicine
**Presenting Author:** Natal van Riel, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands

Metabolic derailments associated with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes can be studied using mixed meal tests (MMTs). Plasma metabolome data, enriched with hormone and cytokine measurements, provide valuable physiological information. Model-based data processing and analysis, combining computer simulation models, stochastic models of uncertainties, and machine learning, were applied to repeated blood sampling during MMTs. In a mouse model of metabolic syndrome, differences in lipid metabolism were linked to weight gain and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The computational model predicted the progression of dyslipidemia to be linked to bile acids, which was confirmed in a validation study. A detailed simulation model of bile acid metabolism and physiology was developed and applied to simulate bariatric surgery, predicting changes in small intestine dynamics and GLP-1 response. The model's robustness allowed for personalized variants, using MTT plasma bile acid metabolomics as input.

We recently introduced a novel scan mode, "parallel accumulation – serial fragmentation" (PASEF), which synchronizes precursor selection with trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) and achieves over ten-fold increased sequencing rates without loss in sensitivity. Here, we explore the benefits of PASEF for lipidomics. Lipid extracts from human plasma, mouse liver, and HeLa cells were analyzed via nanoflow LC coupled to a high-resolution TIMS-QTOF mass spectrometer. Raw data were processed with MetaboScape, and MS/MS spectra were annotated with SimLipid. Compared to conventional TIMS-MS/MS, PASEF acquired six times more MS/MS scans, translating into about twice as many lipid identifications. The PASEF speed allowed us to reduce the LC analysis time from 90 to 30 minutes, while still covering over 90% of the lipids identified with the longer gradient. Accurate collisional cross-section (CCS) measurements in conjunction with PASEF acquisition will greatly benefit metabolomics and lipidomics.

**Title:** Integrating Epidemiologic, Pharmacologic, Genetic, and Gut Microbiome Data in the BBMRI-NL Drug-Metabolome Atlas
**Presenting Author:** Cornelia van Duijn, University of Oxford, United Kingdom

High-throughput metabolic profiling provides unprecedented insights into the effects of drugs on human metabolism. The Biobanking BioMolecular Research Infrastructure of the Netherlands (BBMRI-NL) has constructed an atlas of drug-metabolome associations for 87 commonly prescribed drugs and 150 clinically relevant plasma-based metabolites assessed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR). The atlas, involving a meta-analysis of ten cohorts (18,873 persons), uncovers 1,071 drug-metabolome associations after evaluating confounding factors. Data integration with genetic and pharmaceutical intervention studies on statins shows that cross-sectional data from the BBMRI-NL atlas can predict future drug effects. Further integration with epidemiological data links proton pump inhibitors to circulating metabolites, biochemical liver parameters, hepatic steatosis, and the gut microbiome. The atlas provides a tool for targeted experimental pharmaceutical research to improve drug efficacy, safety, and repurposing. A web-based resource for visualizing the atlas is available at http://bbmri.researchlumc.nl/atlas/.

**Title:** Metabolic Profiling of Tissue-Specific Insulin Resistance in Human Obesity: Results from the Diogenes Study and The Maastricht Study
**Presenting Author:** Ilja Arts, Epidemiology & MaCSBio, Maastricht University, Netherlands
**Co-Authors:** Nicole Vogelzangs, Carla J. van der Kallen, Marleen M. van Greevenbroek, Birgitta W. van der Kolk, Johan W.E. Jocken, Gijs H. Goossens, Nicolaas Schaper, Ronald Henry, Simone J. Eussen, Armand Valsesia, Thomas Hankemeier, Arne Astrup, Wim H.M. Saris, Coen D.A. Stehouwer, Ellen E. Blaak

Recent evidence suggests that insulin resistance (IR) in obesity may develop independently in different organs, representing different etiologies towards type-2 diabetes and other cardiometabolic diseases. This study aimed to investigate whether non-diabetic IR in the liver and skeletal muscle are associated with distinct metabolic profiles. The study included 634 overweight/obese adults without diabetes (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m²) from the European multicenter Diogenes Study. Hepatic and muscle insulin resistance indices were derived from a 5-point oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Seventeen plasma metabolites were quantified by nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopy. In an independent sample of 540 overweight/obese participants without diabetes (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m²) from The Maastricht Study, 11 metabolites and a 7-point OGTT were available for validation. Replicated results indicate that both liver and muscle IR are associated with elevated levels of (branched-chain) amino acids (isoleucine, alanine), lactate, and triglycerides, and lower glycine levels. Only liver IR associates with lower ketone body levels (acetoacetate, 3-OH-butyrate) and elevated levels of ketogenic amino acids (leucine, tyrosine), suggestive of decreased ketogenesis. These findings suggest that in early stages of cardiometabolic disease, distinct metabolic profiles of liver IR and skeletal muscle IR can be observed, potentially enhancing the development of more targeted tissue-specific interventions.

**Title:** Identification of Novel Metabolites in Alkaptonuria by LC-QTOF-MS Profiling and Flux Analysis of a Targeted HGD-/- Mouse Model
**Presenting Author:** Brendan Norman, Institute of Ageing & Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom
**Co-Authors:** Juliette H. Hughes, Andrew S. Davison, Hazel Sutherland, Peter J. Wilson, Norman B. Roberts, Lakshminarayan R. Ranganath, George Bou-Gharios, James A. Gallagher

Alkaptonuria (AKU) is a rare disorder of tyrosine metabolism caused by congenital lack of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD). The primary biochemical consequence of HGD-deficiency is elevated circulating homogentisic acid (HGA), which accumulates in cartilage, causing severe early-onset osteoarthropathy. Metabolic profiling was performed to investigate the wider metabolic consequences of HGD-deficiency in a new targeted HGD-/- mouse model. Urine from 15 HGD-/- and 14 HGD+/- male age-matched mice was analyzed by LC-QTOF-MS. Data were mined using an accurate-mass/retention-time database. Comparing profiles of HGD-/- and HGD+/- urine revealed increases in HGA and 7 previously unreported HGA-derived biotransformation products. Other metabolites showing clear alteration in HGD-/- included thymidine-5’-diphospho-alpha-D-glucose, DL-3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, 2-aminophenol, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (increased), malic acid, isocitrate, and inosine 5’-monophosphate (decreased). Dehydroxymethylene-HGA, HGA-decarboxylate, HGA-glucuronide, and HGA-sulfate were confirmed as derived from HGA in a flux experiment. The data indicate previously uncharacterized clearance mechanisms for elevated HGA and wide-ranging metabolic consequences beyond the tyrosine pathway.

Obesity is a major health problem associated with extensive metabolic disturbances. Identifying causal connections between obesity and its associated metabolites can uncover relevant biology and inform intervention strategies. This study combines metabolite profiling with genetic instrumental variable analyses to infer causality between metabolites, obesity, and related diseases. Using genetic instruments, BMI-associated metabolites were classified in multiple untargeted metabolomics datasets. Meta-analyses and pathway analyses of both known and unknown metabolites were enabled by PAIRUP-MS. Known metabolites more likely to be the cause (e.g., alpha-hydroxybutyrate) or effect (e.g., valine) of higher BMI, or with a bidirectional relationship (e.g., glycine), were identified. Additionally, about five times more unknown than known metabolites were identified in each group. Pathway analysis showed different enriched metabolic pathways in the cause and effect groups, providing further evidence of distinct biological mechanisms. This approach demonstrates the potential to uncover causal connections with obesity from untargeted metabolomics datasets.

**Title:** Metabolomics of Ndufs4-/- Skeletal Muscle: Adaptive Mechanisms Converge at the Ubiquinone-Cycle
**Presenting Author:** Karin Terburgh, North-West University, South Africa
**Co-Authors:** Jeremie Zander Lindeque, Shayne William Mason, Francois Hendrikus van der Westhuizen, Roan Louw

Complex I (CI) deficiency impedes the most efficient mechanism providing electrons to the respiratory chain, leading to reduced cellular energy production. Although CI deficiency is the most common mitochondrial defect, it is poorly understood and lacks effective treatment. Current research on the whole-body Ndufs4 knockout (Ndufs4-/-) mouse model aims to better understand this disease. While the neurological phenotype has been studied, the effect of CI deficiency on skeletal muscle metabolism remains elusive. We combined hypothesis-generating metabolic profiling and enzyme assays to gain insight into the metabolism of glycolytic and oxidative skeletal muscles from Ndufs4-/- mice. Multi-platform metabolomics, comprising liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, was employed. Enzyme assays revealed an 80% reduction in CI activity in both Ndufs4-/- muscle types. As an adaptive response, metabolomics identified several non-classical pathways participating in restoring electron flux to CIII via the ubiquinone (Q)-cycle. Prominent alterations include the involvement of the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle, electron transfer flavoprotein system, CII, and the proline cycle in fuelling the Q-cycle. These adaptive mechanisms could maintain adequate ATP production despite CI deficiency, explaining the lack of muscle involvement in the Ndufs4-/- phenotype.

Coffee drinking has been associated with a lower risk of certain chronic diseases and overall mortality. This study used an untargeted metabolomic approach to (i) characterize variations in the chemical profiles of 76 coffee brew samples, (ii) identify biomarkers of coffee intake in 451 participants of the European Prospective Investigation on Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, and (iii) explore the association of coffee-associated metabolites in 1:1 matched case-control studies on liver cancer (n=221 cases) and fatal liver disease (n=242 cases) nested in the ATBC cohort. PCA analyses on 18 identified coffee compounds showed that the first three principal components were driven by roasting intensity, type of coffee beans, and caffeination. In the EPIC study, 8 coffee metabolites in serum samples were highly correlated with coffee intake, with trigonelline showing the highest correlation. Differences in correlations were observed between countries, possibly due to preferences in coffee types. In the ATBC cohort, 21 metabolites were jointly associated with coffee intake, liver cancer, and liver disease mortality. Trigonelline and six other metabolites (serotonin, leucyl-valyl, 3 glycerophospholipids, and hypoxanthine) were inversely associated with liver cancer and liver disease mortality, while tyrosine and two bile acids were positively associated. This work supports the hepatoprotective effects of coffee consumption and provides new data on variations in coffee composition and optimal biomarkers of coffee intake, important for future epidemiological studies.
