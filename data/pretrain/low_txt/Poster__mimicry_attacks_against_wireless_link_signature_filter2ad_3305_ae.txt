### Optimal Threshold Performance in Different Scenarios

The optimal threshold for the defense scenario yields a false alarm rate (PFA) of 0.0936 and a detection rate (PD) of 0.9064. The defense scenario outperforms the normal scenario, with PFA = 0.0635 and PD = 0.9365, by reducing PFA and increasing PD. In contrast, the forgery scenario exhibits the worst performance, with PFA = 0.4045 and PD = 0.5935. It is important to note that, in our experiment, a link signature originates either from the transmitter or the attacker, resulting in a 50% chance of a blind guess being correct. Consequently, the PFA and PD in the forgery scenario are only marginally better than a random guess.

Figure 13 illustrates the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the normal, forgery, and defense scenarios, where PFA and PD are plotted on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. The curve for the defense scenario is positioned in the top-left corner of the figure, indicating superior performance of the time-synched link signature.

### Frame Time Delay Analysis

The proposed time-synched link signature leverages estimated frame traversal times to filter out frames forwarded by the attacker. We measured the time delays of frames from both the transmitter and the attacker to evaluate this approach. In our experiment, the frame length was 190 bits, and the transmission rate was set to 500 Kbps. The transmitter sent 130 frames, all of which were forwarded by the attacker, resulting in a total of 260 frames received at the receiver.

Figure 14 demonstrates that the time delays of frames forwarded by the attacker significantly exceed those of the frames directly from the transmitter. Further analysis indicates that the ratio of the attacker's delay to the transmitter's delay ranges between 2.2 and 2.6, suggesting that the attacker's forwarding approximately doubles the time delay.

We caution the reader that, due to the limitations of USRP2, our implementation did not perform physical layer timestamping. Therefore, the measured time delays include processing time on the PC and the USRP2 boards. In a real deployment, physical layer timestamping would be necessary to enhance the precision of time synchronization and measurement.

### Defense Scenario Performance

In the defense scenario, as shown in Figure 9, the use of time-synched link signatures increases the difference metric \(d_{a,H}\) for forged link signatures. Specifically, the mean values of \(d_{a,H}\) under the defense and forgery scenarios are 0.7368 and 0.4648, respectively. The histogram in Figure 11 (bottom graph) indicates that the link difference computed from most forged signatures is less than 0.6. This allows the receiver to distinguish between the transmitter and the attacker with a low error rate.

### Detection and False Alarm Rates

As previously mentioned, the receiver measures and stores a history of N link signatures from the transmitter. The receiver then computes the link difference \(d\) between a newly measured link signature and the historical signatures. In our experiment, we followed the same detection rule as used in [5]. If \(d\) is below a certain threshold \(r\), the receiver concludes that the link signature is from the transmitter; otherwise, it assumes the signature is from the attacker.

Let \(N_{FA}\) denote the number of link signatures from the transmitter incorrectly identified as from the attacker, and \(N_D\) denote the number of link signatures from the attacker correctly detected by the receiver. The false alarm rate PFA is calculated as the ratio of \(N_{FA}\) to the total number of the transmitter's link signatures, and the detection rate PD is the ratio of \(N_D\) to the total number of the attacker's link signatures.

Figure 12 shows PFA and PD as a function of the threshold \(r\). A large threshold reduces PFA, while a small threshold increases PD. An optimal threshold that minimizes PFA and maximizes PD is generally desired.

#### Wireless Transmitter Authentication

Existing techniques for non-cryptographic authentication of wireless transmitters can be categorized into three types: software fingerprinting, location distinction, and radiometric identification [2].

- **Software Fingerprinting**: Discrepancies in software configurations are used as fingerprints to distinguish between wireless nodes. For example, Franklin et al. [28] proposed using differences in device drivers to identify 802.11 nodes, and Kohno et al. [30] used clock skews in TCP and ICMP timestamps.
  
- **Location Distinction**: Signals are authenticated by verifying their origin. RSS-based methods estimate the signal origin using RSS values, but they can be defeated with an array antenna. Link signature-based approaches authenticate the channel characteristics between the transmitter and receiver [5], [6], [9]. This paper demonstrates that these link signature schemes are vulnerable to mimicry attacks, and our proposed time-synched link signature addresses this vulnerability.

- **Radiometric Identification**: Physical layer characteristics are used to distinguish between devices. Transient-based techniques (e.g., [31]) and modulation-based techniques (e.g., [2]) are examples of this approach.

#### Attacks on Radiometric Identification

Recent studies [33], [34] have shown that radiometric identification techniques are vulnerable to impersonation attacks. Both transient and modulation-based techniques are susceptible, although transient-based techniques are more difficult to reproduce. Edman and Yener [34] demonstrated that an attacker can impersonate a device using these techniques.

### Conclusion

This paper identifies and analyzes the mimicry attack against existing wireless link signature schemes. We extend the mimicry attack to MIMO systems and show that an attacker using at least the same number of antennas as the receiver can successfully launch the attack. To counter this, we propose a novel time-synched link signature that integrates cryptographic protection and time factors into the wireless physical layer. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the feasibility of mimicry attacks and the effectiveness of the time-synched link signature.
