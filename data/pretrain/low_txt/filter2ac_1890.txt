**Title: Blackhat US-21: The Unintended Consequences of My Role in a Foreign Intelligence Service**

When I left the National Security Agency (NSA), I was offered a job that seemed too good to be true. Unfortunately, it was. In this talk, I will share my experience working on the United Arab Emirates' (UAE) Project Raven, a covert offensive cyber operation. I will discuss the red flags I overlooked due to my naivety and provide guidance for other transitioning intelligence professionals to avoid similar pitfalls.

Project Raven has been extensively covered in Episode 47 of Darknet Diaries, as well as in reports by Chris Bing at Reuters and Nicole Perlroth's book, "This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends."
