**ATT&CK ID:** S1048  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** macOS.OSAMiner

**Description:**

macOS.OSAMiner employs a two-step process to evade detection and disrupt system monitoring. Firstly, it searches for the Activity Monitor process within the System Events process list. If the Activity Monitor is found to be running, macOS.OSAMiner terminates the process. Secondly, the malware scans the operating system's `install.log` for applications that match a predefined, hardcoded list. Any processes associated with these identified applications are also terminated. [54]

This behavior allows macOS.OSAMiner to hide its activities and prevent the user from observing its presence through common monitoring tools.
