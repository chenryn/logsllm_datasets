### Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)
To alert drivers about under- or over-inflated tires, modern vehicles often employ a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS). The most common form of TPMS, known as "Direct TPMS," uses rotating sensors that transmit digital telemetry, typically in similar frequency bands as Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) systems.

### RFID Car Keys
RFID-based vehicle immobilizers are now nearly ubiquitous in modern automobiles and are mandatory in many countries. These systems embed an RFID tag in the key or key fob and a reader in or near the car’s steering column. They prevent the car from operating unless the correct key (verified by the presence of the correct RFID tag) is present.

### Emerging Short-Range Channels
Several manufacturers have started to offer 802.11 WiFi access in their automobiles, primarily to provide "hotspot" Internet access via bridging to a cellular 3G data link. For example, Ford offers this capability in the 2012 Ford Focus. Additionally, some 2011 models provided WiFi receivers, though they were used mainly for assembly line programming.

An emerging wireless channel defined in the Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) standard is being incorporated into proposed standards for Cooperative Collision Warning/Avoidance and Cooperative Cruise Control. Representative programs in the U.S. include the Department of Transportation’s Cooperative Intersection Collision Avoidance Systems (CICAS-V) and the Vehicle Safety Communications Consortium’s VSC-A project. In such systems, forward vehicles communicate digitally with trailing cars to inform them of sudden changes in acceleration, enhancing collision avoidance and harm reduction.

### Summary
For all these channels, if a vulnerability exists in the ECU software responsible for parsing channel messages, an adversary can compromise the ECU (and, by extension, the entire vehicle) simply by transmitting a malicious input within the automobile’s vicinity.

### Long-Range Wireless Channels
Automobiles increasingly include long-distance (greater than 1 km) digital access channels, which fall into two categories: broadcast channels and addressable channels.

#### Broadcast Channels
Broadcast channels are not specifically directed towards a given automobile but can be "tuned into" by receivers on board. These channels include:
- **Global Positioning System (GPS)**
- **Satellite Radio** (e.g., SiriusXM receivers common in late-model vehicles from Honda/Acura, GM, Toyota, Saab, Ford, Kia, BMW, and Audi)
- **Digital Radio** (including the U.S. HD Radio system, standard on 2011 Ford and Volvo models, and Europe’s DAB offered in Ford, Audi, Mercedes, Volvo, and Toyota among others)
- **Radio Data System (RDS)** and **Traffic Message Channel (TMC)** signals transmitted as digital subcarriers on existing FM-bands

The range of these signals depends on transmitter power, modulation, terrain, and interference. For example, a 5 W RDS transmitter can deliver its 1.2 kbps signal reliably over distances up to 10 km. These channels are implemented in the automobile's media system, which often provides access via internal automotive networks to other key ECUs.

#### Addressable Channels
Perhaps the most significant part of the long-range wireless attack surface is exposed by remote telematics systems (e.g., Ford’s Sync, GM’s OnStar, Toyota’s SafetyConnect, Lexus’ Enform, BMW’s BMW Assist, and Mercedes-Benz’ mbrace), which provide continuous connectivity via cellular voice and data networks. These systems support safety (crash reporting), diagnostics (early alert of mechanical issues), anti-theft (remote track and disable), and convenience (hands-free data access such as driving directions or weather).

These cellular channels offer several advantages for attackers:
- **Arbitrary Distance Access**: Due to the wide coverage of cellular data infrastructure.
- **Anonymity**: Can be accessed in a largely anonymous fashion.
- **High Bandwidth**: Typically have relatively high bandwidth.
- **Two-Way Communication**: Support interactive control and data exfiltration.
- **Individual Addressability**: Each device can be individually addressed.

### Knowledge Gap and Threat Model
There is a significant knowledge gap between potential threats and what is currently known about automotive security. Given this gap, much of the threat model may seem far-fetched. However, the next section of this paper explores concrete vulnerabilities and demonstrates practical attacks that can completely compromise a target automobile’s systems without requiring direct physical access.

### Vulnerability Analysis
We now turn to our experimental exploration of the attack surface. We first describe the automobile and key components under evaluation and provide context for the tools and methods employed. We then explore in-depth examples of vulnerabilities via indirect physical channels (CDs and service visits), short-range wireless channels (Bluetooth), and long-range wireless (cellular).

#### Experimental Context
Our experimental work focuses on a moderately priced late-model sedan with standard options and components. Between 100,000 and 200,000 units of this model were produced in the year of manufacture. The car includes less than 30 ECUs, comprising both critical drivetrain components and less critical components such as windshield wipers, door locks, and entertainment functions. These ECUs are interconnected via multiple CAN buses, bridged where necessary. The car exposes several external vectors, including the OBD-II port, media player, Bluetooth, wireless TPMS sensors, keyless entry, satellite radio, RDS, and a telematics unit.

We also obtained the manufacturer’s standard "PassThru" device used by dealerships and service stations for ECU diagnosis and reprogramming, as well as the associated programming software. For several ECUs, notably the media and telematics units, we purchased identical replacement units to accommodate the inevitable "bricking" caused by imperfect attempts at code injection.

Building on our previous work, we established a set of messages and signals that could be sent on the car’s CAN bus (via OBD-II) to control key components (e.g., lights, locks, brakes, and engine) and inject code into key ECUs to insert persistent capabilities and bridge across multiple CAN buses. Note that inter-bus bridging is critical to many of the attacks we explore, as it exposes the attack surface of one set of components to components on a separate bus.

Combining these ECU control and bridging components, we constructed a general "payload" that we attempted to deliver in subsequent experiments with the external attack surface. For every vulnerability we demonstrate, we are able to obtain complete control over the vehicle’s systems. We did not explore weaker attacks.

For each ECU, our experimental approach was to extract its firmware and reverse-engineer its I/O code and data flow using disassembly, interactive logging, and debugging tools. In most cases, extracting the firmware was possible directly via the CAN bus. Having the firmware, we performed three types of analysis: raw code analysis, in situ observations, and interactive debugging with controlled inputs on the bench.

In this environment, interactive debuggers were used to examine memory and single-step through vulnerable code under repeatable conditions. For one such device, the Super-H-based media player, we wrote our own native debugger and exported a control and output interface through an unused serial UART interface. In general, we made use of any native debugging I/O we could identify. For the telematics unit, we wrote a new character driver that exported a command shell to its Unix-like operating system directly over the OBD-II port to enable interactive debugging in a live vehicle.

### Indirect Physical Channels
We consider two distinct indirect physical vectors in detail: the media player (via the CD player) and service access to the OBD-II port.

#### Media Player
The media player in our car is fairly typical, receiving various wireless broadcast signals, including analog AM and FM, as well as digital signals via FM sub-carriers (RDS, called RBDS in the U.S.) and satellite radio. The media player also accepts standard compact discs (via physical insertion) and decodes audio encoded in formats such as raw Red Book audio, MP3, and WMA files on an ISO 9660 filesystem.

The media player unit is manufactured by a major supplier of entertainment systems, both stock units for automobile manufacturers and branded systems sold via the aftermarket. Software running on the CPU handles audio parsing and playback requests, UI functions, and connections to the CAN bus.
