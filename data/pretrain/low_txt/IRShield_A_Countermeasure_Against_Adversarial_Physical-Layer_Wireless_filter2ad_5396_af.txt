### Appendix A: Algorithm Parameters

In Section IV, we introduced Algorithm 1 to generate the IRS configurations for IRShield. Here, we provide additional details on the algorithm parametrization.

#### Progression Rate \( R \)
The progression rate \( R \) affects the decorrelation speed of IRS configurations. Specifically, \( R \) determines the number of randomly selected IRS elements \(\lfloor R \cdot M \rfloor\) that are flipped within the algorithm's randomization step. Therefore, \( R \in [0, 0.5] \). For various values of \( R \), we simulate ensembles of IRS configurations over time with \( P_{\text{hold}} = 0 \), \( M = 256 \) IRS elements, and an update rate of 20 configurations/sec. In Fig. 15, we plot the average Hamming distance over time to the initial configuration at \( t = 0 \). For simplicity, the upper plot shows the behavior of Algorithm 1 with the inversion step disabled (having no effect). The lower plot is obtained using the unmodified algorithm.

Changing few IRS elements, e.g., 5%, is likely to result in a small change in the channel. On the other hand, changing many IRS elements, e.g., 50%, is likely to result in a larger change. Thus, we expect that reducing \( R \) increases the smoothness of the time series of IRS channels. To experimentally assess this effect, we collect Wi-Fi CSI measurements using the setup described in Section III-C. We place the IRS at a distance of 30 cm to the anchor and vary \( R \). Similar to the simulation, we use \( P_{\text{hold}} = 0 \), \( M = 256 \) IRS elements, and an update rate of 20 configurations/sec. We plot the amplitude of a single OFDM subcarrier over time for exemplary values of \( R \) with (Fig. 16) and without (Fig. 17) the inversion step of Algorithm 1 being bypassed. From both figures, we can see the algorithm's desired effect to vary the IRS signal amplitude over time. As expected, it is evident that \( R \) controls the speed of these variations. Apart from \( R \), the effect of the inversion step can be observed in Fig. 17, laying the foundation for an enhanced sliding standard deviation.

**Figure 16:** Time series of a single OFDM subcarrier from Wi-Fi measurements and 1 s sliding-window standard deviation for various values of \( R \). The inversion step of Algorithm 1 is bypassed.

**Figure 15:** Average Hamming distances of IRS configurations w.r.t. \( t = 0 \), without (top) and with (bottom) inversion step.

Since the channel via the IRS, \( H_{\text{IRS}}(k, t) \), is a function of the IRS configuration, \( R \) directly affects the decorrelation speed of the time series of IRS channels. Intuitively, a change of few IRS elements, e.g., 5%, yields a small change in the channel. On the other hand, changing many IRS elements, e.g., 50%, is likely to result in a larger change. Thus, we expect that reducing \( R \) increases the smoothness of the time series of IRS channels. To experimentally assess this effect, we collect Wi-Fi CSI measurements using the setup described in Section III-C. We place the IRS at a distance of 30 cm to the anchor and vary \( R \). Similar to the simulation, we use \( P_{\text{hold}} = 0 \), \( M = 256 \) IRS elements, and an update rate of 20 configurations/sec. We plot the amplitude of a single OFDM subcarrier over time for exemplary values of \( R \) with (Fig. 16) and without (Fig. 17) the inversion step of Algorithm 1 being bypassed. From both figures, we can see the algorithm's desired effect to vary the IRS signal amplitude over time. As expected, it is evident that \( R \) controls the speed of these variations. Apart from \( R \), the effect of the inversion step can be observed in Fig. 17, laying the foundation for an enhanced sliding standard deviation.

**Figure 17:** Time series of a single OFDM subcarrier from Wi-Fi measurements and 1 s sliding-window standard deviation for various values of \( R \).

\( R \) should be chosen low enough such that strong IRS amplitudes persist during the adversary’s sliding standard deviation window to create excursions within \(\bar{\sigma}(w)(t)\). Conversely, when the IRS changes too fast, single strong IRS amplitude deviations will have less impact on \(\bar{\sigma}(w)(t)\). This can be observed in Fig. 17, where we also plot the sliding standard deviations of the CSI time series.

#### Hold Probability \( P_{\text{hold}} \)
In the previous paragraph, we considered Algorithm 1 with \( P_{\text{hold}} = 0 \). In this case, the algorithm is strictly scheduled according to the IRS refresh rate, which we set to 20 configurations/sec. With \( P_{\text{hold}} > 0 \), the algorithm is halted in a probabilistic manner, randomizing the timing of the state transitions and scaling the average IRS refresh rate by the factor \( P_{\text{hold}} \). In turn, short pauses are inserted into the IRS operation, such that \(\bar{\sigma}(w)(t)\) covers a wider range. To investigate the effect, we use the experimental setup outlined in the previous paragraph and collect Wi-Fi CSI measurements for \( R = 0.05 \) and varying values of \( P_{\text{hold}} \). We plot the amplitude of a single OFDM subcarrier and the sliding standard deviation over time in Fig. 18. From the bottom plot, showing \( P_{\text{hold}} = 0.6 \), we can clearly see that the timing of the IRS-induced channel variation becomes increasingly non-uniform.

**Figure 18:** Time series of a single OFDM subcarrier from Wi-Fi measurements and 1 s sliding-window standard deviation for various values of \( P_{\text{hold}} \).

#### Choice of Parameters
Having outlined the effect of \( R \) and \( P_{\text{hold}} \), we next seek to determine values for \( R \) and \( P_{\text{hold}} \). Based on the considerations from Section IV-A, we use the following metrics to assess the algorithm parametrization:

- **IRShield should disturb the adversary’s reference measurement to yield an overly high motion detection threshold.** Thus, the median and MAD of \(\bar{\sigma}(w)(t)\) should be maximized.
- **IRShield should produce strong time-varying fluctuations within the adversarial observation.** Thus, the signal energy (the Euclidean norm) of \(\bar{\sigma}(w)(t)\) should be maximized.
- **The adversarial observation with IRShield should exhibit temporal characteristics similar to actual human motion.** Strong signal variation occurs for durations of 1 – 2 s. We assess the decorrelation speed by means of the coherence time of \(\bar{\sigma}(w)(t)\) as the time its normalized autocorrelation lies above 0.5.

As we can see from Figs. 19 and 20, \( P_{\text{hold}} \) should be at least 0.4, while \( R \) should be between 0.025 and 0.05. Thereby, the adversarial motion detection threshold and the Euclidean norm of \(\bar{\sigma}(w)(t)\) are maximized while the coherence time lies within the desired range of approximately 1 to 2 s.

**Figure 19:** Median, MAD of \(\bar{\sigma}(w)(t)\) and the resulting adversarial motion detection threshold.

**Figure 20:** Euclidean norm (left) and coherence time (right) of \(\bar{\sigma}(w)(t)\).

### Appendix B: Systematic Coverage Experimental Setup

The experimental setup for the systematic coverage tests as described in Section V-B is depicted in Fig. 21.

**Figure 21:** Measurement setup of the coverage test, indicating the 20 rotating reflector positions (left) and the rotating reflector on a wooden frame (right).

### Appendix C: Heatmaps with Reduced Threshold

In Section V-B, we systematically studied the spatial performance of adversarial motion sensing with and without IRShield. Complementing Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, Fig. 22 and Fig. 23 show the spatial distribution of motion detection rates with the maximum of the reference measurement being used as the motion-detection threshold. Thus, the detection rates were obtained with the lowest threshold resulting in a false-positive rate (FPR) of 0 (at least for the observed reference duration). This corresponds to the first row of Table II, indicated by \(\max_t \{ \cdot \}\).

**Figure 22:** Spatial distribution of detection rates for anchor position 1 with the lowest motion-detection threshold yielding a false-positive rate of 0.

**Figure 23:** Spatial distribution of detection rates for anchor position 2 with the lowest motion-detection threshold yielding a false-positive rate of 0.
