### Improved Text

Tor demonstrates significantly better behavior, greater stability, and higher goodput, indicating that it provides a safer and more reliable form of proxied communication. While we remain cautious about the use of open proxies, some of the identified risks can be partially mitigated. Tools such as HTTPS Everywhere [7] can help reduce the risk of traffic manipulation by enforcing end-to-end protections. The continued rollout of certificate transparency and similar measures will also likely reduce (though not eliminate) the risk, as they thwart the certificate manipulation attacks described above.

However, where end-to-end integrity and authenticity guarantees are not possible (e.g., for unencrypted web traffic), the use of open proxies still carries substantial risk. Given that users often struggle to adhere to safe browsing habits even in the absence of proxies [17, 28, 42], we are hesitant to recommend relying on browser-based protections to defend against malicious proxy behavior. Our findings suggest that the risks associated with using open proxies are numerous and likely outweigh their benefits.
