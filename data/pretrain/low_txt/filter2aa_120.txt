## Background on Authentication

### Identification
- **Definition:** The method used by a system (not necessarily a computer) to uniquely identify an individual or group.
- **Examples:** User names, Driver's License, School ID, Security Badge, Passport.

### Authentication
- **Definition:** The method(s) used to verify the given identification against a database of known information.
- **Examples:** Passwords, Fingerprints, Iris Prints, Negotiation.

### Development of Authentication
- **What you know…**
- **What you have…**
- **What you are…**
- **Future Development:** How you are...

## General Network Security

### What Security Is and Isn't
- **Security is NOT:**
  - Installing a firewall
  - A product or service
  - Running an audit and shutting things off
- **Security IS:**
  - Working productively and without interruptions
  - Only as good as the weakest link
  - Risk management of resources (equipment, people)
  - Physical security
  - A process, methodology, policies, and people
  - 24x7x365

### Common Threats
- No silver bullet to network security
- Replay attacks
- Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)
- Spoofing
- Users
- Dictionary Attacks

### Security Thoughts
- 80-90% of issues are internal
- Hard drive crash (data loss and recovery time)
- Firewall penetration (access and visibility)
- Internet failure (lost productivity/revenue, backup connection)
- Some can always get in

### Conclusion
- Biometrics will help but will not solve all problems
- Users are the "weakest link"
- Proactive security plan

## Need for High-Grade Authentication

- **High Security Areas**
- **Multiple Factor Authentication**
- **Challenge and Response Authentication**
- **High Assurance of Proper Identification**
- **Data Retrieval Based on the Person**

## Background on Error Types

### Type I Error (Accept in Error)
- Balance Between Type I and Type II Error
- Most Dangerous
- High Exposure
- Preventable
- Need for Additional Security Measures

### Type II Error (Deny in Error)
- Balance Between Type I and Type II Error
- Only an Inconvenience
- Preventable
- Established by a High Security Policy

## Forms of Biometric Authentication

- **Fingerprint Scanners**
- **Retina Scanners**
- **Iris Scanners**
- **Voice Print Scanners**
- **Handwriting Recognition**
- **Face Recognition**
- **Personal Geometry**
- **DNA**

## Problems and Solutions

### Proper Network Security with Biometric Devices

#### Securing Biometric Signatures
- Tamper-resistant storage
- Protection from corruption
- Secure signature changes
- Secure backups
- Stop signature interception
- Protect latent signatures

#### Logon Security
- Trusted Path to the authentication device
- Tamper resistance
- Clear or encrypted transmission
- Continuous monitoring
- What “goes down the wire”?
- Real biometric?

#### Bypass Prevention
- Tamper resistance at the local machine
- Enhanced biometrics to tell a real biometric from a fake biometric
- Both biometrics and passwords needed

#### Consistency
- Environmental effects
- All network users adhere to the same policy
- All network machines configured identically

### Can Biometrics be Bypassed?
- How they are connected
- The device can be fooled
- Consistency

## Demos and Discussion

- **Demo of Fingerprint Scanner Authentication**
- **Demo of Iris Scanner Authentication**
- **Wire Capture Analysis**
- **Recent Bypassing Methods**
- **How to Bypass**
- **Question and Answer**
