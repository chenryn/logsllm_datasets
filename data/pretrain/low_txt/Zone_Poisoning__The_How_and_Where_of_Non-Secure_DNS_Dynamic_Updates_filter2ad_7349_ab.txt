### Original Requestor's Permissions

The original requestor is only permitted to make changes on the slave server.

### Conclusion of Lab Experiments

Our lab experiments demonstrate that systems allowing non-secure dynamic updates are vulnerable to attacks that can modify existing records and add new ones. Non-secure update mechanisms include both overly permissive address match lists (e.g., "any") and more focused match lists, which can be bypassed via IP spoofing.

### 4.2 Scanning Setup

To evaluate the potential impact of non-secure dynamic updates, we developed an efficient scanner capable of sending DNS packets compliant with RFC 2136 [38]. The scanner attempts to add an extra A record to the zone file, associating a new upper-level domain, `researchdelft`, with the IP address of our project’s web server. We do not spoof the source IP address of the update request. Our web server provides information about the project and a method for opting out of our scans. Notably, we have not received any abuse complaints or opt-out requests, which may indicate that the insertion of the record was either not seen as problematic or went unnoticed. The scan does not interact with existing data in the zone file. Since our request is technically equivalent to a regular update request, we do not expect it to interfere with normal activity, and we have observed no evidence to the contrary.

We analyzed responses from authoritative name servers and performed DNS lookups to verify if our domain resolved to our web server’s IP address. We also conducted a ten-day study to estimate how long the added resource record (RR) remained in the zone. Finally, we removed the test DNS record by sending a delete UPDATE request and then attempted to resolve it again. All added records were successfully deleted.

### 4.3 Ethical Considerations

While vulnerability scanning is a well-established part of security research, our approach raises ethical questions because the only valid method available to us for assessing the vulnerability of a DNS server was to add a record to the zone file. We submitted our study to the TU Delft Human Research Ethics Committee, which determined that we did not need their authorization since we were not conducting human subjects research. This highlights that current institutional review procedures may not be set up to evaluate ethical issues in computer security.

We assessed our work using the principles outlined in the Menlo Report [17]. We do not collect data on individuals. Obtaining informed consent before adding a record to the zone file is impractical and would introduce selection bias, as administrators of well-secured servers are more likely to consent. We provide a clear opt-out mechanism via the website referenced in the added DNS record. The site also provides full transparency regarding the study and its objectives.

Our approach in testing the vulnerability is designed to have minimal impact: we send a single RFC-compliant packet and do not read, change, or otherwise engage with any existing records. We believe the drawback of lacking consent from server operators is outweighed by the benefits of our measurement, which makes operators aware of a critical vulnerability in their DNS server. All notifications were completed before the publication of this paper. The new record is highly unlikely to be discovered by accident and is removed at the end of the study.

### 4.4 Dataset

To measure the prevalence of non-secure configurations, we collected data for two samples: a random sample of 1% of the domain space and the Alexa top 1 million domains (Alexa 1M) [1].

First, we extracted all domains observed in two complementary datasets between January 2015 and January 2016: i) DNSDB, a large passive DNS database fed by hundreds of sensors worldwide, operated by Farsight Security [3], which provided access to us, and ii) Project Sonar Data Repository, obtained through ANY RR requests, made available by Rapid7 Labs [4].

From the total 286,788,250 unique domains, we randomly sampled 1%. For this sample and for the Alexa 1M, we enumerated all observed combinations of name servers and their IP addresses in both datasets: over 27 million and 7 million, respectively (see Table 1). The long observation period and the fact that DNSDB contains many poisoned entries, either maliciously [23, 16] or unintentionally [40], means we expected many IP addresses on the list to be obsolete, but we aimed to find as many as possible.

We performed the vulnerability assessment against the random sample on March 30, 2016, and against the Alexa 1M on April 10, 2016. For each domain, we sent an UPDATE request directly to all IP addresses on the list. As expected, many did not respond, which could indicate obsolete NS information, network filtering, or other policies. We received responses from 6.0 million (random sample) and 2.3 million (Alexa 1M) name servers (see Table 2).

### 5. Results

#### 5.1 Prevalence of Vulnerable Resources

Table 2 summarizes the DNS status codes received in response to the UPDATE requests. As expected, the majority of requests fail to add RRs to the zone. The most common code is REFUSED, meaning the server refuses the operation for security or policy reasons. Around 12.1% and 15.6% of name servers signal NOTIMP, indicating they do not implement the protocol extension, while 22.8% and 11.3% of servers cannot parse and interpret the dynamic update request, signaling FORMERR. Additionally, 19.9% and 15.6% of name servers signal that they are not authoritative for the zone. The main reason for DNS responses with the NOTAUTH error flag is the presence of obsolete NS information in our dataset, as described in Section 4.4. Approximately 0.2% of servers signal SERVFAIL, indicating a hardware error or out-of-memory condition, and the zone is restored to its state before the transaction [38]. We found 13,580 and 5,093 systems to respond with NOERROR status code for the 1% sample and Alexa 1M, respectively, corresponding to 0.2% of responses. Note that NOERROR includes all responses with this status flag set, regardless of whether the actual content of the zone has been updated.

We sent an A RR request to each potentially updated server to verify if the zone file was indeed updated. For the random sample, we observed 2,626 successfully added A RRs, corresponding to 188 unique name servers and 1,877 unique domain names (0.065% of all randomly selected second-level domains). Surprisingly, we also observed 881 added A RRs, corresponding to 560 unique name servers and 587 domains from Alexa 1M (0.062%).

#### 5.2 Affected Domains

To understand the population of vulnerable domains, we first analyzed the type of network hosting them. In earlier work, we developed a categorization of providers based on ground-truth data, manual labeling, WHOIS records, and passive DNS data [11, 36]. We were able to classify 105 (out of 206) providers for the random sample and 210 (out of 398) for the Alexa 1M.

Figure 1 outlines the number of providers with at least one vulnerable server in their network. As expected, hosting and ISP broadband constitute a significant portion of the affected providers. Interestingly, we observed misconfigured zones in as many as 52 educational networks in the Alexa 1M.

Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution of vulnerable domains over providers. In the random sample, we find that 66.2% (1,149) of vulnerable domains are hosted on the infrastructure of a single Japanese broadband ISP. Reconfiguring the zone files of just 10 providers would reduce the prevalence of the issue by 88.6%. If this concentration is representative of the overall domain space, reaching out to a limited number of operators could significantly increase the costs for cybercriminals to find vulnerable domains. For the Alexa 1M, the pattern is less concentrated, but high-traffic sites are typically professionally operated, so a comprehensive notification campaign might be effective.

We further analyzed the cumulative distributions of vulnerable domains on DNS servers in descending order of the number of their common domains. In the vulnerable 1% sample, we found that only one server is authoritative for as many as 1,635 (87%) domains, whereas in the Alexa 1M, one DNS server is associated with 154 (26%) domains. As expected, the cumulative concentrations per DNS server are similar to those observed for providers (see Figure 2), as they operate the name servers themselves. In the 1% sample, for example, just six servers sharing the same second- and top-level domain (*.dnsserver.net) are authoritative for 89.8% of the vulnerable domains, all hosted by the same broadband ISP in Japan.
