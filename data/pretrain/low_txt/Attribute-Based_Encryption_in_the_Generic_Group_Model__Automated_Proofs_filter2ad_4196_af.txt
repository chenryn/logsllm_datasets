# Table 2: Encodings Analyzed with Our Automatic Tool

| Scheme | Proof | Security Level | Many-Key | One-Key |
|---------|-------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| KP-ABE [36] | × | 0.046 | - | One-key* |
| CP-ABE [36] | × | 1.52 | - | One-key* |
| NIPE, ZIPE [36] | × | - | - | One-key* |
| CP-ABE for negated BF [11] | × | 0.212 | - | One-key* |
| Unbounded KP-ABE (cid:52) | × | 5.75 | - | Insecure |

- **Proof**: (cid:88) means the tool fully proved the scheme, × means it could not prove the scheme.
- **Security Level**: The level of symbolic security that was analyzed.
- **Many-Key/One-Key**: Indicates if the scheme is secure under many-key or one-key scenarios. * denotes that one-key symbolic security is sufficient to achieve many-key security in the GGM (see Theorem 4.1).

## Several Encodings from the Literature
We have analyzed several encodings from the literature, including CP-ABE and KP-ABE from [36], and the CP-ABE for negated boolean formulas from [11]. For more complex schemes like our CP-ABE and KP-ABE, our tool can only prove security for fixed-size dimensions. This limitation arises either because it is challenging to express the full scheme's security using our grammar or because our heuristics fail to find a proof. Additionally, our tool can automatically detect attacks on the candidate Unbounded KP-ABE (cid:52).

## Comparison with Previous Work
Our tool follows the approach of the Generic Group Analyzer (gga) [20] and the Generic Group Analyzer Unbounded (gga∞) [10]. Like gga∞, our tool can handle systems of equations with an unbounded number of terms, which is essential for analyzing many security experiments. Furthermore, our tool is defined over a new grammar (described in Figure 6), complementing previous tools and expanding the range of schemes that can be analyzed with computer assistance. Specifically, our handling of division and large products is sufficient to analyze many of the primitives proposed in this work.

## Performance Evaluation
We have implemented the schemes introduced in the previous section, as well as several Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) schemes from the literature. Our implementation uses Charm [7] for pairings with a prime-order group in the standard model. We have demonstrated how our tool can be used to automatically prove the security of various schemes, including variants of existing schemes and new schemes, and to discover subtle attacks.

### Future Work
- **Theoretical**: Prove that RFI ABE are selectively secure in the standard model under a strong Q-type assumption.
- **Practical**: Develop synthesis techniques for exploring the space of RFI ABE. As in prior works using synthesis [10, 22], we plan to systematically explore large classes of constructions, using our tool to find attacks and proofs. To improve coverage, we aim to enhance the tool's efficiency in finding attacks and proofs. Establishing mathematical theorems to focus on more restricted, tractable classes of constructions is also desirable.
- **Beyond ABE**: Explore the use of our tool for Structure-Preserving Signatures, particularly for synthesizing Structure-Preserving Signatures based on rational fractions.
