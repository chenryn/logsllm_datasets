## Abstract

Malicious domains are key components in various cyber attacks. Recent techniques for identifying malicious domains often rely on local domain features extracted from DNS data. However, these features can be easily manipulated by attackers to evade detection without significantly affecting their attack capabilities.

In this paper, we propose a complementary approach that focuses on discovering and analyzing global associations among domains. The key challenges are (1) building meaningful associations among domains and (2) using these associations to infer the potential maliciousness of domains. To address the first challenge, we leverage the dynamic behavior of malicious domains, such as frequent changes in domain-IP resolutions and the creation of new domains. This behavior often results in multiple malicious domains being hosted on the same IPs or multiple IPs hosting the same malicious domains, creating intrinsic associations.

For the second challenge, we develop a graph-based inference technique over associated domains. Our approach is based on the intuition that a domain with strong associations with known malicious domains is likely to be malicious. Carefully established associations enable the discovery of a large set of new malicious domains using a small set of previously known ones. Experiments over a public passive DNS database show that our technique achieves high true positive rates (over 95%) while maintaining low false positive rates (less than 0.5%). Even with a small set of known malicious domains (a couple of hundreds), our technique can discover a large set of potential malicious domains (up to tens of thousands).

## 1. Introduction

Malicious domains are essential components in various cyber attacks, including phishing, botnet command and control, and spam. Identifying and blocking access to these domains is crucial. Many existing techniques use local network and host information, including DNS data, to build classifiers that distinguish malicious domains from benign ones. However, these approaches are vulnerable because many of the features used can be easily altered by attackers.

In this paper, we take a complementary approach by focusing on global associations among domains. We derive these associations from passive DNS data, though other data sources like server logs and WHOIS records can be integrated to enhance confidence. Our observation is that, although individual DNS features can be altered, attackers must host malicious domains on IPs they control. Additionally, tactics like frequent domain creation and fast fluxing create dynamic characteristics among groups of malicious domains. Consequently, multiple malicious domains may end up being hosted on the same IPs, and multiple IPs may host the same malicious domains, creating intrinsic associations.

Our approach is based on the intuition that a domain with strong associations with known malicious domains is likely to be malicious. We address several key issues: defining the association between domains, assessing the maliciousness of related domains, and ensuring the inference process is efficient and scalable.

## 2. Related Work

Several efforts have been dedicated to identifying malicious domains using different types of data and analysis techniques. Here, we discuss representative work most relevant to our approach:

- **Notos [1]**: Uses passive DNS data to assign reputation scores to unknown domains based on features extracted from DNS queries.
- **EXPOSURE [3]**: Follows a similar methodology but requires less training time and data. It is agnostic to the type of services provided by malicious domains.
- **Phoenix [10]**: Differentiates between DGA and non-DGA malicious domains by modeling pronounceable domains.
- **Antonakakis et al. [2]**: Detects DGAs by monitoring the increase in NXDomain responses in DNS traffic.
- **Manadhata et al. [7]**: Builds a bipartite host-domain graph and applies belief propagation to identify malicious domains.
- **Rahbarinia et al. [8]**: Extracts user behavior patterns from DNS query logs to track malware-controlled domains.
- **SMASH [15]**: Infers groups of related servers involved in malware campaigns using HTTP traffic patterns.

Our approach complements these efforts by focusing on global topologies of the deployment of malicious domains over IPs, using public aggregated passive DNS data, and avoiding privacy concerns.

## 3. Proposed Approach

### 3.1. Defining Domain Associations

We define the association between two domains if they are hosted by the same IPs during a period of time. This measure is robust because it is tied to the key properties of how malicious resources are utilized. We further develop heuristics to enhance the confidence of these associations, acknowledging that domains may share the same IP without being related, especially in web hosting scenarios.

### 3.2. Constructing Domain Graphs

Based on the above associations, we construct graphs to reflect the global correlations among domains. We propose a path-based mechanism to derive a malicious score for each domain based on its topological connection to known malicious domains. This score is then used to assess the maliciousness of other related domains.

### 3.3. Experimental Evaluation

We conduct extensive experiments using a large-scale publicly available passive DNS database and ground truth collected from public sources. Our results show that the proposed technique achieves high true positive rates (over 98%) while maintaining low false positive rates (less than 0.5%). Even with a small set of known malicious domains, our technique can discover a large set of potential malicious domains (tens of thousands).

## 4. Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a complementary approach to detect malicious domains by focusing on global associations among domains. Our graph-based inference technique leverages passive DNS data to discover new malicious domains with high accuracy and low false positives. This approach can be integrated with robust local features to further improve its effectiveness and can be combined with classification-based schemes to enhance overall detection capabilities.
