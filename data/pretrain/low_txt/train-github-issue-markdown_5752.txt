The dropdown links in the navigation bar function correctly in Chrome under normal circumstances. However, when the navbar is collapsed, the links do not display a hover state, and clicking on them only collapses the dropdown menu instead of navigating to the intended page.

You can view and test this issue using the following JSFiddle: [http://jsfiddle.net/richyclarke/urbnD/3/](http://jsfiddle.net/richyclarke/urbnD/3/). To reproduce the problem, reduce the frame size to collapse the navbar, then attempt to click on the 'IBM' link under the main 'Links' list item. This issue is present in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox, as well as on iOS devices (both Chrome and Safari on iPad and iPhone). 

Interestingly, the functionality worked correctly in Bootstrap 2.1.x, but it has ceased to work since version 2.2.0 and continues to be non-functional in the 2.3.x series. In contrast, the feature still operates as expected in Internet Explorer 10 and possibly other versions of IE.
