### RX-Promotion and GlavMed/SpamIt: Revenue Analysis

The net revenue for the period under review, which is the profit returned to the affiliate program owners, constitutes 16.3% of the gross revenue. However, this figure is not consistent on a month-to-month basis. For instance, during the period when processing for controlled drugs was suspended, RX-Promotion experienced a simultaneous loss in revenue, incurred substantial fines, and had to pay higher average commissions (as commissions for controlled drugs were discounted by 10%). This led to a net loss in at least one month. Conversely, in the most profitable month (September), the net revenue exceeded 30%.

We lack comprehensive indirect cost data for GlavMed or SpamIt, but we can infer a subset of these overheads. The operators utilized a special affiliate (affiliate ID 20) to manage the working capital. This affiliate account received referral commissions from all affiliates who did not have a designated referring affiliate. During the measurement period, Affiliate 20 earned $2.7 million. Operating expenditures and some affiliate payouts were deducted from this account.

Starting in May 2009, the comment field of each payout began including a brief description of the payment. For example, a payment for a banner advertisement (used to recruit affiliates) would be listed as "banner GM - gofuckbiz.com." Using a manually generated list of regular expressions, we identified several indirect costs from May 2009 to April 2010. These costs include marketing ($153K, 0.2% of revenue), domain purchasing ($511K, 0.8% of revenue), and servers/hosting ($247K, 0.4% of revenue). Notably, marketing and server/hosting costs appear to be similar between the two programs, suggesting they are largely fixed costs. Domain purchasing, however, seems to correlate with revenue, likely due to the need for more domains to handle increased advertising volume and avoid blacklisting.

Additionally, we have anecdotal data in the form of chat logs between the lead operator and the owner of GlavMed/SpamIt. These logs indicate that overall net revenue fluctuated between 10% and 20%, aligning with the RX-Promotion data. Therefore, we believe that a typical net revenue for successful pharmaceutical programs is likely to fall within the 10-20% range. While this is lower on an earnings-per-sale basis compared to individual affiliate commissions, it is more profitable for the program as a whole. For example, the largest SpamIt affiliate might earn $2 million in a year, but the program itself could clear over $10 million in profit in the same period.

### Markup Analysis

After commissions, supply costs are one of the largest expenses for these programs. Based on the categories in Figure 2, erectile dysfunction (ED) products are the most popular and have the highest markups, ranging from 15 to 20 times the supply cost. For instance, the markup on Viagra in GlavMed and SpamIt translates to a customer price 25 times the cost. Markups for the Abuse and Chronic categories are significantly lower, ranging from 5 to 8 times the supply cost. Interestingly, shipping is a loss leader for GlavMed/SpamIt, as they charge a flat fee per order (orders with multiple items result in supplier shipping costs exceeding collected fees) and offer free shipping for orders over $200. In fact, for the orders with detailed product and shipping cost data, the supplier costs for delivering the drugs ($8.5M) exceeded the costs of the drugs themselves.

### Payment Processing

Finally, affiliate programs must secure reliable payment processing services. Obtaining such services may be the most critical function of the affiliate program, as it is the only mechanism by which all other efforts can be monetized. Our previous research identified that a small number of banks were crucial for virtually all online pharmaceutical sales [14]. However, the means by which these banks were accessed has never been well-documented.

In the "high-risk" payment market, merchant processing is often handled by independent Payment Service Providers (PSPs) who manage relationships with acquiring banks and provide web-based payment gateway services. While users of these services may have a contractual relationship with the bank, PSPs sometimes "front" their own merchant accounts on behalf of clients, a practice known as "factoring" and typically disallowed by card association rules. Merchants can mitigate risks by working with multiple providers, providing redundancy and different service offerings (e.g., MC, Visa, Amex, eCheck) for different product categories (e.g., herbal vs. prescription vs. controlled drugs).

For RX-Promotion, the affiliate program partnered with a large ISO/PSP, which handled virtually all of their processing needs. In contrast, GlavMed and SpamIt worked with no fewer than twenty-one distinct providers over the lifetime of our datasets. However, these providers differ in the services they offer, the volume of transactions they can handle, and their longevity. Almost half of these providers were never used for significant transaction volumes, likely due to risk controls.

Figure 10 illustrates the transaction volume of GlavMed/SpamIt handled by different payment service providers over time. The y-axis identifies the top nine providers, while the remaining providers are aggregated. Each circle represents the number of transactions processed via a particular terminal in a month, with terminals grouped by provider based on the time of first use. The color red indicates MasterCard transactions, blue for Visa, yellow for other credit cards (primarily Amex), and green for eCheck. The grey penumbra around each circle indicates the number of declined transactions.

Several observations can be drawn from this figure. First, Visa processing dominates, representing almost 67% of all revenue, followed by MasterCard with 23% and American Express with 6%. While part of this discrepancy is due to demand (Visa being the most popular payment card brand), it also reflects a supply issue, as it has traditionally been easier for online pharmaceutical programs to obtain Visa processing services than those for MasterCard or Amex.

Second, a few payment service providers dominate the transaction volume, with GL, LT, and LV together responsible for 84% of all revenue for GlavMed and SpamIt. Many other providers are active for very short periods and with low volumes before being abandoned or unwilling to continue business with the program operators.

Finally, there are clear patterns indicating problems with particular providers over time. A sudden drop in volume and rise in declines typically precedes a terminal being abandoned. Some cases reflect changes in long-term business relationships, such as the transition of Visa processing from LV to LT in March 2008 and American Express processing from AFF to SN during the same period. In the last five months of 2010, GlavMed/SpamIt experienced significant setbacks in processing capability, with LT processing only minor volumes, forcing them to push more transactions through GL. These findings support our previous observations that the financial aspect of the counterfeit pharmaceutical ecosystem is among the most fragile components [14].

### Conclusion

This paper provides an unprecedented view into the economics of modern pharmaceutical affiliate programs, which capitalize on a wide array of infrastructure services, including botnets, malware, and bullet-proof hosting. We have shown that the customer market is large and far from fully tapped, with repeat orders playing a key role in mature programs. A small number of big affiliates can dominate the revenue equation, and disrupting these affiliates would have a disproportionate impact on the entire program. Even large programs like GlavMed/SpamIt depend on a handful of payment service providers to reliably monetize their activities, reinforcing the observation that financial services are a "weak point" in the value chain. Despite driving substantial sales, the costs are significant, and net revenues are modest, typically under 20% of sales. This finding suggests that such organizations are vulnerable to even modest economic disruptions.
