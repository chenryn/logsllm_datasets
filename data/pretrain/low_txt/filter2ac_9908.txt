**Abstract**

There has been an alarming increase in the number of virus and worm attacks, phishing emails, and identity theft, both on the internet and in physical infrastructures. Indeed, cyberspace exhibits several features of lawlessness that make it difficult to replicate societal trust relationships in this domain. A cursory examination of issues like phishing or electronic voting reveals that the challenges we face have both technological and policy components. Furthermore, with our increasing dependency on computing and communication to manage physical infrastructures such as electric power, water, and gas, these systems are also vulnerable to information attacks.

To address these grand societal challenges, in June 2004, the National Science Foundation (NSF) established a Science and Technology Center titled "TRUST: Team for Research in Ubiquitous Secure Technologies." This center involves collaboration between Berkeley (lead), Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Cornell, Stanford, and Vanderbilt, with outreach partners at San Jose State, Mills, and Smith College.

In this talk, I will provide an overview of the research, education, technology transfer, privacy, and policy work currently underway at the TRUST Center. Rather than presenting a comprehensive list of projects, I will highlight a few selected examples of the work, technology transfer, and impact the Center has already achieved in the area of networked embedded systems.

In recent years, there has been significant excitement about the evolution of sensor webs and smart dust. There has been substantial global activity in this field, and at Berkeley, over six generations of "motes" have been developed for these sensor webs. At least three new startups have emerged to commercialize these developments. I will survey these advancements and discuss where they have led us in what is undoubtedly a very important new class of computing, involving the integration of communication and computation. I will describe how the technological push is matched by the application pull from numerous different use cases.

Throughout the talk, I will highlight the efforts of my group and those of my colleagues, especially David Culler, Kris Pister, David Wagner, and Eric Brewer, in "closing the loop" around these networked embedded systems. We believe that closing the loop brings into sharp focus the real-time constraints and inherent issues in the use of networked embedded systems. Moreover, the most important new directions in sensor webs involve moving beyond mere sensing and monitoring of the physical environment and infrastructure. Specifically, I will describe the range of methods and algorithms needed to track multiple targets in a sensor web and to pursue them. I will also discuss the security aspects of using sensor networks in physical infrastructures.
