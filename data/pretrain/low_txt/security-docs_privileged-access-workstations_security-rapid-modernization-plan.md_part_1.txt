# Rapid Modernization Plan for Security Infrastructure

This rapid modernization plan (RAMP) will help you quickly adopt Microsoft's recommended [privileged access strategy](privileged-access-strategy.md). The roadmap builds on the technical controls established in the [privileged access deployment](privileged-access-deployment.md) guidance. Complete those steps and then follow the RAMP to configure the controls for your organization.

![Privileged Access RAMP Summary](./media/security-rapid-modernization-plan/privileged-access-ramp-summary.png)

> **Note:** Many of these steps involve a green/brownfield dynamic, as organizations often have existing security risks in their current deployments or configurations. This roadmap prioritizes stopping the accumulation of new security risks first, followed by addressing existing issues.

As you progress through the roadmap, use Microsoft Secure Score to track and compare your progress with similar organizations over time. Learn more about Microsoft Secure Score in the article [Secure score overview](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-secure-score).

Each item in this RAMP is structured as an initiative, using the objectives and key results (OKR) methodology. Each item includes the objective, rationale, responsible parties, implementation steps, and key results. Some initiatives require changes to processes and skills, while others are simpler technology changes. Collaboration with stakeholders outside the traditional IT department is essential to ensure successful integration.

## Separate and Manage Privileged Accounts

### Emergency Access Accounts
- **Objective**: Ensure that you are not accidentally locked out of your Microsoft Entra organization in an emergency situation.
- **Rationale**: Emergency access accounts are rarely used but are highly damaging if compromised. Their availability is critical for rare but necessary scenarios.
- **Responsible Parties**:
  - **Sponsorship**: CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity
  - **Execution**:
    - [Policy and Standards](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-policy-standards) team to document clear requirements and standards
    - [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) or [Central IT Operations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) to implement changes
    - [Security Compliance Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-compliance-management) to monitor compliance
- **Implementation**: Follow the guidance in [Manage emergency access accounts in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/roles/security-emergency-access).
- **Key Results**:
  - Established: Emergency access process designed based on Microsoft guidance that meets organizational needs
  - Maintained: Emergency access reviewed and tested within the past 90 days

### Enable Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
- **Objective**: Use PIM in your Microsoft Entra production environment to discover and secure privileged accounts.
- **Rationale**: PIM provides time-based and approval-based role activation to mitigate the risks of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions.
- **Responsible Parties**:
  - **Sponsorship**: CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity
  - **Execution**:
    - [Policy and Standards](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-policy-standards) team to document clear requirements and standards
    - [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) or [Central IT Operations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) to implement changes
    - [Security Compliance Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-compliance-management) to monitor compliance
- **Implementation**: Deploy and configure PIM using the guidance in [Deploy Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-deployment-plan).
- **Key Results**: 100% of applicable privileged access roles are using Microsoft Entra PIM

### Identify and Categorize Privileged Accounts (Microsoft Entra ID)
- **Objective**: Identify all roles and groups with high business impact that require privileged security levels.
- **Rationale**: This step is necessary to identify and minimize the number of people who need separate accounts and privileged access protection.
- **Responsible Parties**:
  - **Sponsorship**: CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity
  - **Execution**:
    - [Policy and Standards](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-policy-standards) team to document clear requirements and standards
    - [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) or [Central IT Operations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) to implement changes
    - [Security Compliance Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-compliance-management) to monitor compliance
- **Implementation**: After enabling PIM, view users in the following Microsoft Entra roles:
  - Global Administrator
  - Privileged Role Administrator
  - Exchange Administrator
  - SharePoint Administrator
  - For a complete list, see [Administrator role permissions in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference).
  - Remove any accounts no longer needed in these roles.
  - Categorize remaining accounts:
    - Assigned to administrative users but also used for non-administrative productivity
    - Assigned to administrative users and used only for administrative purposes
    - Shared across multiple users
    - For break-glass emergency access
    - For automated scripts
    - For external users
  - If PIM is not available, use PowerShell API, starting with the Global Administrator role.
- **Key Results**: Review and identification of privileged access roles completed within the past 90 days

### Separate Accounts (On-premises AD Accounts)
- **Objective**: Secure on-premises privileged administrative accounts.
- **Rationale**: Hardening the accounts used for administrative tasks. Administrator accounts should have mail disabled and no personal Microsoft accounts allowed.
- **Responsible Parties**:
  - **Sponsorship**: CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity
  - **Execution**:
    - [Policy and Standards](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-policy-standards) team to document clear requirements and standards
    - [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) or [Central IT Operations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) to implement changes
    - [Security Compliance Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-compliance-management) to monitor compliance
- **Implementation**:
  - Create separate admin accounts for users needing on-premises administrative tasks.
  - Deploy Privileged Access Workstations for Active Directory administrators.
  - Create unique local admin passwords for workstations and servers.
  - Do not share administrative accounts between users.
- **Key Results**: 100% of on-premises privileged users have separate dedicated accounts

### Microsoft Defender for Identity
- **Objective**: Combine on-premises signals with cloud insights to monitor, protect, and investigate events in a simplified format.
- **Rationale**: Modern attackers may remain undetected for long periods. A cohesive picture of your entire identity environment is crucial for detecting threats.
- **Responsible Parties**:
  - **Sponsorship**: CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity
- **Implementation**:
  - Monitor users, entity behavior, and activities with learning-based analytics.
  - Protect user identities and credentials stored in Active Directory.
  - Identify and investigate suspicious user activities and advanced attacks throughout the kill chain.
  - Provide clear incident information on a simple timeline for fast triage.
- **Key Results**: 
  - Monitor and protect user identities and credentials
  - Detect and investigate advanced attacks effectively

By following these steps, you can rapidly modernize your security infrastructure and enhance your organization's overall security posture.
