### Comparison with Fixed Devices

In fact, the opposite is true. While the Coalition has submitted a prototype of a personal/portable device for the Commission to test, no group has yet provided a prototype of a fixed device. Therefore, the only information available on fixed devices is based on theoretical analyses and hypothetical models. This information is less valuable compared to the concrete data that can be obtained by testing an actual device.

### IEEE 802.18 and MSTV's Position

IEEE 802.18 and MSTV argue that because IEEE 802 has not developed standards for personal/portable devices, the FCC should not authorize such devices but instead initiate another proceeding to examine them. However, the lack of timely standardization by IEEE 802 should not dictate spectrum policy. The Commission's role is to establish protection standards, not to mandate specific implementation approaches. In the initial Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), the Commission sought information about personal/portable devices at the same time it proposed the use of fixed devices. Since IEEE 802 chose to address only the latter, it should not influence the former. Moreover, established standards are not a prerequisite for Commission authorization. Spectrum allocation often precedes standardization, as seen in the cases of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ultra-wideband, and other innovative services. Spectrum allocation is a governmental task, not one for private parties developing technology standards that may or may not serve the public interest.

### MSTV's Suggestion

MSTV suggests that the Commission and industry must "gain experience" with fixed devices before authorizing personal/portable devices. This argument is flawed: fixed and personal/portable devices operate under different parameters and functions. Experience with fixed devices will not provide relevant insights into personal/portable devices. In fact, with the operating parameters chosen by the Coalition, personal/portable devices pose less risk than fixed devices. The Commission can obtain sufficient information to authorize personal/portable devices, and should do so simultaneously with or even before fixed devices.

### MSTV's Deadline Proposal

MSTV insists that TV band devices should not be authorized for sale until at least February 2009. The Coalition urges the Commission to maintain its commitment to allow the sale of such devices by February 17, 2009. As previously explained, the Coalition has solid roadmaps for delivering unlicensed devices in the TV band in the near term. Delaying this deadline will divert resources away from development, significantly reducing the likelihood of innovative TV band services and devices.

### Summary

Opponents of personal/portable devices have not provided a compelling reason for the Commission to decline their authorization or to undertake another rulemaking. Nor have they demonstrated why personal/portable devices should be authorized later than fixed devices. The Commission should act as soon as possible to authorize the sale of unlicensed TV band devices, including personal/portable devices, by no later than February 17, 2009.

### Unlicensed Use of the White Spaces

Several parties have noted that this proceeding began with the recognition that the significant growth and consumer demand for unlicensed wireless broadband applications support opening up the white spaces for unlicensed use. While some commenters continue to push for licensed allocation, these arguments have been effectively refuted. The Coalition and others have explained that unlicensed use will yield substantial benefits, while licensed services are unlikely to be deployed extensively and will not provide greater protection to incumbents.

### Inconsistencies in Advocacy

There is an inconsistency in the advocacy of those favoring licensed use. On one hand, they suggest that extensive use of the white spaces is unworkable, yet they also insist that the white spaces will create so much value that their auction could generate billions of dollars. One party proposes that white space licensees be allowed to pay incumbents to accept interference. This proposal may disenfranchise some TV viewers and cause broadcasters to violate the public trust. It is also inconsistent with the broadcasters' insistence that "public’s free over-the-air television service" is sacrosanct.

### Licensed Allocation and Efficient Spectrum Use

Comments filed by Charles Jackson and Dorothy Robyn, funded by Qualcomm, make the most extensive case for licensed use of the white spaces. Their argument is based on economist Ronald Coase's theorem, which posits that, absent transaction costs, any well-defined allocation of property rights will lead to an efficient outcome. However, the underlying premise—that broadcasters should be entitled to sell portions of the TV channel spectrum—is beyond the scope of this proceeding. The Further Notice sought public comment only on whether the white spaces should be allocated on an unlicensed or licensed basis. The extremely low transaction costs required for successful Coasian bargaining are highly unlikely to occur, making the proposal impractical.

### Infrastructure Investment

Licensed advocates argue that the "certainty" of a white spaces license would compel more infrastructure investment. However, many uses for which the TV white spaces are suited, such as neighborhood and municipal mesh networks, require little to no infrastructure investment. The history of investment in unlicensed spectrum refutes the speculation that a licensed regime will lead to greater investment. The uncertain nature of rights allocated under a white space license would negate whatever unique investment incentive a license would otherwise provide.

### Value of the White Spaces for Unlicensed Use

Despite the Commission's recognition of the growing consumer demand for unlicensed wireless spectrum and specific proposals for unlicensed use, advocates of licensed use continue to maintain that there is "no documented need for additional unlicensed spectrum." This is incorrect. Of the "beachfront" spectrum below 2 GHz, only 26 MHz is available for unlicensed broadband use, compared to 1,974 MHz for federal or licensed use. There is no unlicensed spectrum available for wireless broadband below 900 MHz. The Commission has recognized that the white spaces can provide cheaper and more widely available broadband, as well as new and innovative types of devices and services. Only an unlicensed allocation will ensure that available white spaces spectrum can be accessed throughout the country.
