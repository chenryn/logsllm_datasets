## Managing Your Inputs
Now that you understand where your inputs come from, it's essential to establish a system to manage them effectively. This will ensure that you can continuously capture items in a frictionless way.

### Empty the Inbox
With all items that have your attention collected, it's time to process your inbox. The goal is not to complete each item but to analyze and decide what it is, what it means, and what action to take. Follow the steps below until you reach the bottom of your inbox:

1. **Clarify and Organize**: Dump, file, or delegate items as appropriate.
2. **Two-Minute Rule**: If an item takes less than two minutes to complete, do it immediately.
3. **Action Items**: Categorize items that require more time into actions to be done soon, someday, or on a specific date.
4. **Waiting For**: Track reminders of things you’re waiting on from other people.

Once everything is at the next action level, scale up in abstraction to prioritize better what to do next.

## Unclassified Thoughts
- **Zero Resistance**: There must be zero resistance to using the systems you have. Continually reinventing your in-tray, filing system, and processing methods can only lead to distraction.
- **Productivity Tools**: One of the best tricks for enhancing productivity is having organizing tools you love to use.
- **Organization Definition**: Being organized means that where something is matches what it means to you.
- **Evolution**: Your organization system will evolve as you process your stuff and test out whether you have put everything in the best place for you. It won't remain static; it will evolve as you do.

## Weekly Review
The Weekly Review is the time to:
- **Gather and Process All Your Stuff**
- **Review Your System**
- **Update Your Lists**
- **Get Clean, Clear, Current, and Complete**
