### Effectiveness and Efficiency of Careflows through Personalized Dashboards

The effectiveness and efficiency of careflows can be significantly enhanced by leveraging personalized dashboards built from selected Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These dashboards not only provide real-time insights but also offer additional change suggestions to improve overall performance.

### State-of-the-Art and Challenges

The success of social networks has inspired researchers to apply similar technologies to support communities of practice. These communities are vital catalysts for research, economic, and social processes (de Moor, 2005) and drive the evolution of socio-technical systems (Wenger et al., 2002). In healthcare, these communities bring together medical experts, practitioners, patients, and their families. However, related work in this area is limited. Nordqvist (2009) discusses how websites can assist chronic patients with daily disease management. Arenella (2010) uses Medscape, a popular online medical education provider, to disseminate palliative care education to health professionals. Additionally, integrated care and research networks, which combine patient data and expertise through shared databases and disease registries, aim to harmonize procedures, enhance international epidemiological surveillance, and improve pharmaco-vigilance (Nurok, 2010).

A careflow collaborative platform must integrate case management careflows with broader social networking and community applications. Historically, healthcare professionals have been resistant to such platforms due to inconsistent user interfaces, unclear interaction patterns, and unintuitive designs. Therefore, it is essential to carefully consider the daily activities, computer literacy, interaction patterns, and sociometrics of healthcare professionals. Developing a robust social network-based collaborative platform requires a combination of social theory and technology to quantify and study professional relationships effectively.

### Innovation and Implications

A key innovation is the involvement of all healthcare professionals in the collaborative platform, coordinated within a "community of practice" represented through medical social networks. This approach is novel, as no existing social community of practice focuses on sharing and improving careflows through formal methods. Currently, most communities operate in an "open-loop" mode, where users can find suggestions and recommended paths but lack active participation in the improvement process. The proposed framework aims to close this loop, making caregivers' and healthcare professionals' feedback the starting point for improvements. Members of these communities need to share common-ground knowledge to discuss careflows using consistent terminologies and concepts. Thus, the platform and its tools rely on an ontology with formally defined concepts.

**Implication 5: Reinforced Leadership and Multidisciplinary Research Excellence**
This framework will reinforce industry leadership and strengthen multidisciplinary research excellence in supporting innovative medical care.

### Research Methodology

The proposed framework for next-generation e-health systems and services is designed to guide the creation of artifacts that serve human purposes. It is amenable to a Design Science approach, as discussed by March and Smith (1995). The primary goal is to improve careflows, driving all building and evaluation efforts with utility in mind.

March and Smith (1995) identify four research outputs (artifacts in the form of constructs or concepts, models, methods, and instantiations) and four research activities (build, evaluate, theorize, and justify). These outputs can be instantiated in specific products, physical implementations intended to perform certain tasks, operationalizing constructs, models, and methods to demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness. Instantiations may precede the complete articulation of the underlying artifacts.

- **Build:** Construct the artifact, considering its value or utility to a community of users. The key question is, "Does the artifact work?"
- **Evaluate:** Assess how well the artifact works.
- **Theorize:** Clarify the characteristics of the artifact and its interaction with the environment based on observed performance. Theorizing explains why and how the artifact works.
- **Justify:** Gather evidence to test the theory and justify the explanation.

The research team includes members from various disciplines and collaborates with healthcare institutions for deployment and testing. So far, the focus has been on base artifacts, including developing concepts like careflow mining, careflow compliance, careflow management, and careflow Business Intelligence (BI), and experimenting with methods to achieve the goals for each area. Initial iterations of evaluation, theorization, and justification have led to a model—the proposed framework—that will guide the evolution and integration of the base artifacts into a software platform in a healthcare institution.

### Conclusion

Recent developments and programming paradigms, such as process-driven systems (e.g., Amazon SWF), service-orientation (e.g., Web APIs and cloud services), and data analysis (e.g., using map-reduce), have demonstrated significant advantages in building modern information systems. While these developments have been quickly adopted by competitive businesses, they also hold substantial potential for the next generation of e-health systems. However, this requires identifying the e-health areas where these technologies can be most effectively applied.

We have described a framework centered on the concept of care workflows, integrating five key areas: careflow mining, careflow compliance, careflow management, careflow BI, and careflow collaboration. The main limitation of the proposed framework is its better applicability in healthcare environments that already use process-aware Information Systems (IS) or have adopted business process management initiatives.
