## 1. Problem Statement
Internet Traffic Engineering (TE) is a critical research area for production networks, where the primary goal is to minimize the maximum link utilization (MLU). For instance, with the increasing volume of IPv6 traffic, the backbone network of CERNET2 is experiencing significant pressure on some critical long-haul links under traditional shortest-path routing. 

In this paper, we develop a practical and cost-effective intra-domain TE method, named CTE, using CERNET2 as a case study. Existing intra-domain TE proposals, such as MPLS-based [2], OpenFlow-based [3], and reactive-TE [4] methods, require substantial modifications to routers, often necessitating the replacement of existing routers with new ones, making deployment very expensive. Other TE methods, like the one proposed in [5], optimize OSPF weights for TE. Although these methods have lower deployment costs, they require frequent changes to OSPF weights based on dynamically changing traffic matrices. Each change in OSPF weights can lead to transient routing loops or traffic disruption, which is unacceptable for network operators.

CTE operates in an OSPF/IS-IS network, where shortest-path routing is used. The core idea of CTE is to use loop-free next hops [7] to route some traffic, achieved by configuring static routes and access control list (ACL) rules. CTE does not modify existing routers; it only requires a remote control program to configure static routes and ACL rules. Additionally, CTE can be incrementally deployed.

## 2. CTE Approach
### 2.1 Optimization Model
We first develop an optimization model to calculate splitting ratios under a whole traffic matrix, referred to as the TEW model. Let \( N \) be the set of nodes and \( L \) be the set of links. The capacity of a link \( l \) is denoted by \( c_l \). The traffic matrix \( T \) represents the size of traffic from node \( i \) to node \( j \). The set of routing variables \( x_{ij}^k \) denotes the size of traffic destined to node \( j \) over link \( k \). The splitting ratio over link \( e \) on node \( i \) is given by:

\[
\text{Splitting Ratio} = \frac{x_{ij}^e}{\sum_{k \in \text{Out}(i)} x_{ij}^k}
\]

where \( \text{Out}(i) \) is the set of outgoing links from node \( i \). If node \( i \) is a legacy node, the available next hops are the shortest-path next hops. If node \( i \) is a CTE node, the available next hops include both the shortest-path and loop-free next hops.

The optimization problem can be formulated as:

\[
\min \max_{l \in L} \left( \frac{\sum_{i,j} x_{ij}^l}{c_l} \right)
\]

subject to:
\[
\sum_{k \in \text{Out}(i)} x_{ij}^k = T_{ij} \quad \forall i, j
\]
\[
\sum_{k \in \text{In}(j)} x_{ij}^k = T_{ij} \quad \forall i, j
\]

where \( \text{In}(j) \) is the set of incoming links to node \( j \), and \( \text{MLU} \) is the MLU variable. Only \( x_{ij}^k \) and \( \text{MLU} \) are variables; all other symbols are constants.

### 2.2 Reliable Update Mechanism
To avoid transient routing loops and traffic disruption, we design a reliable update mechanism for static routes and ACL rules. This mechanism ensures that all old configurations are removed before new ones are installed. Specifically:
- Remove all static routes and ACL rules associated with the old splitting ratios before installing new ones.
- If no traffic is routed via a specific next hop, any static routes and ACL rules associated with that next hop can be directly installed or removed.

Theorem 1: The reliable update mechanism will not produce any routing loops or traffic disruption. Using this mechanism, updates can be completed in at most two steps.

## 3. Evaluations
We collected traffic matrices from CERNET2's backbone routers from February 19, 2013, to March 26, 2013, under traditional OSPF routing. We also gathered the capacity and OSPF weight of each link. The traffic matrices were packaged every five minutes. In our simulations, we assumed that the desired splitting ratios could be achieved by configuring static routes and ACLs, which will be evaluated in future work.

We applied splitting ratios computed by CTE based on the previous five-minute traffic matrix to the next five-minute traffic matrix and calculated the MLU reduction ratio. Figure 3 shows the average MLU reduction ratio during all five-minute intervals with varying numbers of CTE-controlled nodes. Upgrading just two nodes resulted in an average MLU reduction ratio of 0.75. Figure 4 presents the cumulative distribution function (CDF) curves of the MLU reduction ratios. "CTE 2" denotes the results of upgrading two routers, "CTE all" denotes the results of upgrading all routers, and "Limit" represents the theoretical limit assuming universal MPLS deployment and known traffic matrices.

## 4. Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper, we propose CTE, a cost-effective intra-domain TE method. CTE requires no modifications to existing routers and only needs a remote control program to configure static routes and ACLs. It is also incrementally deployable. Our evaluation results show that CTE achieves near-optimal TE performance when fully deployed and considerable performance even when partially deployed. Future work includes optimizing the number of static routes and ACL rules needed and developing mechanisms for incremental updates.
