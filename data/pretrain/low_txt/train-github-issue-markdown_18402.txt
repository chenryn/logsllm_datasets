It would be great to have the option for an off-canvas navigation. While I have no issues with the current dropdown style on mobile, I personally prefer the off-canvas approach. 

Of course, this option may not be suitable for every website, just as the dropdown style isn't always the best fit. Therefore, it would be beneficial to have a choice based on the specific needs of each project. In my opinion, the off-canvas style is more in line with mobile design, as it is commonly seen in mobile applications.

Hereâ€™s a good example:

As you can see, the navigation links automatically switch to an off-canvas format when viewed on smaller screens. 

Does anyone else agree?
