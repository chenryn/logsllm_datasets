### Appendix A: Survey Instrument

Our complete survey instrument included 60 questions related to a respondent’s experiences online with respect to security, privacy, and abuse. We report only the exact text of the survey components that we relied on for our study of hate and harassment. The survey instrument’s questions about a respondent’s age and gender were fixed by the panel provider to enable reaching a minimum stratified cross-section. As such, we were unable to ask specifically about non-binary participants at the time of our survey. Likewise, these questions did not have a “Prefer not to say” option to ensure sufficient samples per stratum. When asking about whether a participant identified as LGBTQ+, we omitted the question in regions where such affiliations are heavily stigmatized or dangerous due to government policies, based on feedback from the panel provider. Finally, when asking about a participant’s education level, we tailored the education categories per region. As such, when comparing demographics across countries, we normalized to two groups: “Secondary or less” and “Some college or more.”
