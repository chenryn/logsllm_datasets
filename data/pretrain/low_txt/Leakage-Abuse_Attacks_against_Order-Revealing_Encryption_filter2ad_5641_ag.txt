### Lower-Frequency Names and Recovery Rates

Our results indicate that some lower-frequency names exhibit higher recovery rates. This phenomenon can be attributed to overlaps. For instance, the names "James" and "John" are lexicographically close, so addressing the overlaps in their intervals introduces dataset-dependent errors. This is also why the recovery rates for certain names, such as "Michael," decrease as more names are targeted (e.g., "Michael" with \( k = 10 \) versus \( k = 40 \) in the previous paragraph).

### Attack Variants

The attack's use of confidence intervals allows the attacker to adjust the precision-recall trade-off. For example, if the attacker is only interested in targeting individuals named "Michael" and wants to ensure high precision, they can lower the confidence value \( d \) to make fewer, more accurate guesses. Conversely, if the goal is to maximize recall, the attacker can set \( d \) very close to 1.

We leave the exploration of the trade-off between accuracy and the confidence value as an open problem. An intriguing scenario is one where the attacker has a model of the discrepancy between their auxiliary data and the true plaintext distribution. In this case, the attacker could use different confidence values for different plaintexts.

### Broader Implications

Reflecting on these findings, we should consider the implications for the security of any Order-Preserving Encryption (OPE) or Order-Revealing Encryption (ORE). Our results demonstrate that high-frequency elements encrypted with OPE or ORE can be reliably recovered (with a probability significantly better than the baseline) even if their frequency is not leaked. This raises concerns about the suitability of OPE and ORE for the highly non-uniform distributions commonly encountered in practice.

#### Property-Revealing Encryption Schemes

The study of encryption schemes that preserve order was initiated by Agrawal et al. [1], who constructed a scheme for numeric inputs but lacked provable guarantees. The first OPE scheme with reductionist security guarantees was proposed by Boldyreva, Chenette, Lee, and O'Neill [5]. Their scheme's window one-wayness security was later analyzed by Boldyreva, Chenette, and O'Neill [6]. We utilize their analysis in our attacks against the BCLO scheme, as discussed in Section V.

In [6], it was shown that any OPE scheme that provably leaks only frequency and order must have exponentially large ciphertexts. Popa et al. [37] extended this negative result to stateful, interactive schemes with immutable ciphertexts. They also introduced an interactive OPE scheme with mutable ciphertexts that leaks at most order and frequency information. Kerschbaum and Schröpfer [26] proposed a more efficient interactive OPE scheme, which is also vulnerable to our attacks in Section IV. Later, Kerschbaum [25] introduced a frequency-hiding, interactive OPE scheme, which is affected by our attack in Section VIII.

ORE was introduced by Boneh et al. [7] with the aim of providing better security while still allowing order comparisons. Their scheme relies on multilinear maps [18], making them currently inefficient [29] and potentially insecure given doubts about the cryptographic hardness assumptions related to multilinear maps [2, 21, 33]. Our attack in Section VIII would affect these schemes. CLWW [12] provided a practical ORE scheme that also leaks frequency, and our attacks in Section VI apply to this scheme, as well as their suggestion of composing OPE with ORE. Lewi and Wu [30] developed a new ORE construction that leaks less than CLWW but does not achieve ideal leakage. Their construction is elegant but impractical due to large ciphertext sizes. For a security parameter \( \lambda \approx 128 \) and a plaintext domain of size \( n \), their ciphertexts require \( O(\lambda n) \) space.

#### Schemes Supporting Range Queries

Recent schemes [16, 30, 41] have been developed to support only range queries. Lewi and Wu's scheme [30] can be modified to support only range queries, with security similar to Kerschbaum's frequency-hiding scheme, and is vulnerable to our attacks. Roche et al. [41] designed their scheme under the assumption that not all values will be queried, achieving stronger security at the cost of applicability to most ORE applications. Faber et al. [16] adapted the OXT searchable encryption protocol [11] to support range queries by transforming them into disjunctive queries, but at the cost of a significant increase in database size. To enable range queries on a column containing \( M \) \( n \)-bit values with a security parameter \( \lambda \approx 128 \), they require a size of \( O(\lambda M \log n) \). Their scheme resists offline inference attacks, but the large increase in space complexity greatly diminishes its practical deployability. Since these are not ORE schemes, they are outside the scope of this work.

#### Systems Using ORE/OPE

Several companies and services, including CipherCloud and Skyhigh Networks [13, 22, 36, 43], advertise encryption that preserves functionality. CryptDB [38, 40] was the first system in the academic literature to introduce a scheme for running a large subset of SQL on the server side with an encrypted database (EDB). It used deterministic encryption and OPE, as well as standard encryption. Since then, the popularity of EDBs has increased, with many companies, such as IQrypt [22] and SAP [42], producing their own CryptDB-inspired solutions. Some recent academic systems, such as Seabed [35] and Minicrypt [48], also use OPE or ORE.

#### Attacks Against Property-Revealing Encryption

Inference attacks were first considered against searchable symmetric encryption [14, 44] by Islam, Kuzu, and Kantarcioglu [23], with subsequent improvements and investigation of active attacks by Cash et al. [10] and Zhang et al. [47]. Grubbs et al. [19] presented an active attack against the multi-user searchable encryption scheme used in Mylar [39]. Naveed et al. [34] were the first to consider inference attacks against CryptDB-style EDBs, as discussed in Section IV.

#### Concurrent Work

In concurrent and independent work, Durak, DuBuisson, and Cash [15] showed how the sorting attack from NKW [34] can be extended to the multi-column case when two or more columns contain correlated data. They demonstrated that multi-column attacks are more devastating than separate attacks on individual columns. They also showed attacks on non-ideal OPE/ORE schemes that leak more than the order and frequency of the ciphertexts, including the BCLO scheme. Their primary focus is sparse datasets such as GPS coordinates, and they do not examine names, birthdates, or ZIP codes, as we do in our case study.

Durak et al. do not exploit auxiliary information, relying solely on leakage. In contrast, our attacks show how to both exploit leakage and augment auxiliary-information-based inference attacks. Their attacks provide approximate recovery of plaintexts (e.g., determining that a plaintext lies within some 10km radius), whereas our attacks recover entire plaintexts and, in many cases, fully recover most records in a database.

### Conclusion and Future Work

In this work, we have studied the security of OPE and ORE as they are used in real systems. We developed new cryptanalytic techniques for several existing OPE and ORE schemes and evaluated them experimentally by performing plaintext recovery attacks against first and last names, birthdates, and ZIP codes from several real datasets. Our attacks are effective in fully recovering plaintexts from OPE and ORE ciphertexts.

Our work has been empirical, but we believe our attacks will be effective against many other kinds of datasets used in practice. We also leave as an open question the provision of a more formal analysis of inference attacks. Future work could develop adaptive inference attacks, where an attacker can make a limited number of adaptive chosen plaintext queries while running an inference attack.

Our results suggest that OPE/ORE often provides only marginal security for an important usage case. We believe the results will generalize to other use cases. We also do not know if these attacks are optimal, so future work may uncover even more damaging attacks. Given all this, we recommend practitioners avoid using OPE/ORE if possible. In some deployment scenarios, the only practical alternative in the short term is leaving data in the clear, and here OPE/ORE is clearly better than no encryption. For such cases, we hope our methodologies can be used to help evaluate the security achieved.
