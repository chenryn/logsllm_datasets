### 5.4 Performance Comparison

To further evaluate the performance improvements of our MIPNet architecture, we conducted a final set of experiments to compare it with the naive use of underlying cryptographic primitives. Specifically, we recreated the MIPChat client without any of the optimizations discussed in this work (e.g., RSA-OT, groups, etc.) and compiled our circuits using an unmodified version of the Fairplay compiler, executing them in the basic architecture.

Unfortunately, this direct comparison was not feasible because the Fairplay compiler exceeded the 1GB memory limit set by the Java virtual machine. As an alternative, we used only the OBDD compiler without any additional optimizations. For \( n = 100 \), we recorded 50 iterations of the protocol and observed an average execution time of 35.626 seconds, with a 95% confidence interval of ±0.161 seconds. In contrast, the performance profile of our optimized MIPChat client achieved a reduction in execution time of 98.5%. This significant improvement over the naive application of SFE primitives demonstrates that our optimizations and careful parameterization can enable these constructions to meet near real-time performance requirements.

### 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced Mix-In-Place Networks (MIPNets), an architecture built on Secure Function Evaluation (SFE) that replaces multiple intermediary nodes with a cascade of functions in a single proxy. By leveraging SFE, this proxy remains oblivious to the source, destination, and content of all messages exchanged within the system. We demonstrated that our proposed architecture provides provable deniability and, through extensive performance analysis, showed that our optimizations can reduce execution time by more than 98%, making it practical for applications with near real-time requirements, such as instant messaging for up to 100 clients.

We also discussed several enhancements that could further improve the performance, scalability, and robustness of our architecture. Our work not only highlights the practicality of using a single node to mix traffic with provable properties but also shows that SFE can address a gap in the anonymous communications space for applications with moderate performance constraints and no guarantees of adequate cross-traffic.
