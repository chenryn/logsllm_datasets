### The Tor Project

**Mission Statement:**
The Tor Project is dedicated to being the global resource for technology, advocacy, research, and education in the ongoing pursuit of freedom of speech, privacy rights online, and censorship circumvention.

### Key Features

- **Online Anonymity:**
  - **Open Source:** All code is freely available and can be audited.
  - **Open Network:** A decentralized network that anyone can join.
- **Community:**
  - A vibrant community of researchers, developers, users, and relay operators.
- **Organizational Structure:**
  - A U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

### User Base
- **Estimated Daily Users:** Over 2,000,000

### Threat Model
- **What Can an Attacker Do?**
  - **Alice (User):** Seeks anonymity.
  - **Anonymity Network:** Provides a layer of protection.
  - **Bob (Recipient/Observer):** May be watched or may watch Alice.
  - **Attacker:** Can control part of the network.

### Understanding Anonymity
- **Anonymity vs. Encryption:**
  - **Encryption:** Protects the content of the communication.
  - **Anonymity:** Conceals the identity of the communicating parties.

### Anonymity for Different User Groups
- **Private Citizens:**
  - **Interest:** Privacy
- **Businesses:**
  - **Interest:** Network security
- **Governments:**
  - **Interest:** Traffic-analysis resistance
- **Human Rights Activists:**
  - **Interest:** Reachability

### Simple Designs
- **Single Relay:**
  - Uses one relay to hide connections.
  - Example: Some commercial proxy providers.
  - **Drawbacks:**
    - Single point of failure.
    - Single point of bypass.
    - Timing analysis can bridge all connections through the relay, making it a vulnerable target.

### Tor's Safety and Diversity
- **Diversity of Relays:**
  - More relays and more diversity reduce the risk of traffic confirmation attacks.
  - Research problem: Measuring diversity over time.
- **Diversity of Users and Reasons:**
  - A large number of users (e.g., 50,000 in Iran) means most are normal citizens.

### Transparency
- **Key Aspects:**
  - Open source and free software.
  - Public design documents and specifications.
  - Publicly identified developers.
  - Privacy is about choice, not a contradiction.

### Addressing Concerns
- **Bad Actors:**
  - Millions of daily users.
  - Good people need Tor more than bad actors.
- **Myths:**
  - **Myth #1:** "I heard the Navy wrote Tor originally, so how can I trust it?"
  - **Myth #2:** "I heard the NSA runs half the relays."
  - **Myth #3:** "I heard Tor is slow."
  - **Myth #4:** "I heard Tor gets most of its money from the US government."
  - **Myth #5:** "I heard 80% of Tor is bad people."
  - **Myth #6:** "I shouldn't use Tor because if I do, the NSA will watch me."
  - **Myth #7:** "I heard Tor is broken."

### Onion Services
- **Properties:**
  - Self-authenticated.
  - End-to-end encrypted.
  - Built-in NAT punching.
  - Limits surface area.
  - No need to "exit" from Tor.

### Adoption and Tools
- **Onion Services:**
  - About 3% of onion services are still in the "neat toy" stage.
  - Terbium Labs and others found about 7,000 useful onion sites.
- **SecureDrop:**
  - Used by over 30 organizations.

- **Ricochet:**
  - [https://ricochet.im/](https://ricochet.im/)
- **OnionShare:**
  - [https://onionshare.org/](https://onionshare.org/)
- **Riseup.net Services:**
  - Available using hidden services.

### Benefits of Anonymous Updates
- **Evil Package Repository:**
  - Cannot target you with a bad update because they don't know your identity.
- **Local Observer:**
  - Cannot learn what you are updating, preventing targeted attacks.

### HS Directory and Hashring
- **HS Directory:**
  - Predictable HSDirs for a given onion address.
  - Solution: Include a communal random value in the HSDir mapping.
- **New Keys:**
  - Longer onion addresses (from 16 to 52 characters).
  - Example: `nzh3fv6jc6jskki3.onion` to `a1uik0w1gmfq3i5ievxdm9ceu27e88g6o7pe0r,dw9jmntwkdsd.onion`

### Network-Wide Shared Random Value
- **Solution:**
  - Directory authorities pick a communal random value each day.
  - Prevents bad actors from targeting specific days.

### HSDirs and Onion Addresses
- **Threat Intelligence:**
  - Companies try to gather otherwise-unpublished onion addresses.
  - Solution: Use subkeys for signing onion descriptors.

### Rendezvous and Proposals
- **Rendezvous Point:**
  - Proposal 260.
- **OnionBalance:**
  - [https://onionbalance.readthedocs.io/](https://onionbalance.readthedocs.io/)
- **Vanguards (Tor Proposal 271):**
  - Multiple layers of guards protect against Sybil and compromise attacks.

### Limitations
- **Not Foolproof:**
  - Operational security mistakes.
  - Browser metadata fingerprints.
  - Browser exploits.
  - Traffic analysis.

### Conclusion
- **High Secure, Low Latency Internet Anonymity:**
  - "Still the King of high secure, low latency Internet anonymity."
  - "There are no contenders for the throne."
