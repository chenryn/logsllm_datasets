### Multiple Traces of the 'REQA' Command/Response Sequence

We conducted an analysis using three different models of Type A cards: an advanced dual-interface microprocessor card, a 4K Mifare card, and a low-cost Mifare 'Ultra Lite' card. Figure 3 illustrates a complete REQA command/response sequence as measured in the reader's RX circuit.

The REQA (Request for Answer) is the first command issued by the reader to the card when it enters the reader's field. This command was chosen because the standard requires the card to begin modulating its response after a fixed number of carrier cycles following the reader's last command bit. This mirrors our proposal, where the card takes a fixed number of cycles to compute its response. However, in the case of REQA, the response always begins with the modulation of a start bit, equivalent to a logical 'one' in our scheme.

### Experimental Setup and Observations

Traces were recorded with cards at various distances and orientations relative to the reader. The orientation and distance affect the voltage across the reader's receive circuit. As the distance increases, the voltage also increases, but the rate of change that the card can effect on the carrier amplitude decreases. Therefore, greater card-to-reader distances require more cycles to produce a detectable change in carrier amplitude.

This phenomenon is clearly visible in Figure 4, which shows the carrier for four different voltages around the time marked B in Figure 3. The first carrier half cycle that the card attempts to modulate is marked with a vertical line. For the two smallest voltage traces, an amplitude change is evident. For the highest voltage trace, no discernible amplitude change occurs on this cycle; the first significant change appears one and a half cycles later at 0.8729 µs. We found that the rate of amplitude change is a function of the voltage, irrespective of the orientation and distance. In our analysis, we consider dependent variables such as the delay in detecting a modulation peak against antenna voltage rather than distance and orientation, which are difficult to specify precisely.

### Communication Method and Alignment

In ISO 14443 Type A, the reader communicates with the card via 100% amplitude shift keying (ASK), as shown in the left part of Figure 3. We aligned the traces on the first cycle that resumes the carrier in the last bit pause. This alignment is precise and unambiguous, as illustrated in Figure 5, which presents a short period of the region marked at point A in Figure 3 for five different trace voltages. Using this alignment as a reference point, we can confidently identify the half cycle that the card starts its load modulation on, regardless of whether an amplitude change is actually evident. This allows us to measure the number of cycles required to produce a detectable amplitude change and thus characterize the timing latency at that voltage.

### Analysis and Results

Using MATLAB, a numerical analysis and simulation tool, we developed a model of an amplitude peak detection circuit. The detector compares each half-cycle peak amplitude to an average of eight previous peaks of the same sign. If the difference exceeds a threshold value, the current peak is signaled as a modulation. The choice of threshold value is crucial as it determines the sensitivity to detecting true modulation peaks and the likelihood that channel noise will be falsely interpreted as a peak.

The trade-off between true and false positives becomes more delicate as the antenna voltage increases because changes in amplitude become progressively less pronounced, eventually disappearing into the noise floor. This effect is evident in Figure 6, which shows the percentage change in amplitude for a modulation peak number versus antenna voltage. For example, the first modulation peak shows a 30% amplitude increase at 200 mV but barely any discernible increase at 1200 mV.

We derived a voltage-dependent function to generate the 'Threshold' values in Figure 6 based on 1000 traces taken with one card type at a range of voltages. We experimentally identified a threshold for each trace that correctly identified the modulation peaks while keeping false positives below a maximum of 20. Lowering the threshold increases the probability of detecting real modulation cycles early but also increases the number of false detections of non-modulated peaks due to environmental noise.

The peak detector examines approximately 2300 peaks per trace (the portion of the carrier signal between points A and B in Figure 3). A threshold that produces no more than 20 false positives in this region provides an approximation of a false detect error rate of <1% when the card sends zero (by not modulating).

The experimentally identified threshold/voltage data pairs were fitted to a third-degree polynomial, and this function was used to specify threshold values for traces at a range of voltages for the other two card types. We found that the voltage-dependent threshold function derived from the data for one card produced very similar true and false positive rates when used on traces for the other cards. While our results are not conclusive due to the small number of cards examined, it appears possible that a single voltage-dependent threshold function will work across a range of cards, simplifying the implementation of the peak detection circuitry in reader devices.

### Timing Resolution and Operating Range

Figure 7 shows the average and maximum timing resolution as a function of antenna voltage. The first modulation peak is reliably detectable up to 500 mV, so there is no detection delay, and the timing resolution is 1/2fc or 37 ns. Between 500 and 800 mV, the average slightly increases because the first peak is detected in only 75% of cases. We argue that the resolution up to 800 mV is sufficient for the worst-case scenario—detection of short-range attacks using exotic and expensive relay equipment with very low group delay. The average timing resolution at higher voltages increases to 300 ns, which is still 50 times smaller than the delay introduced by Hancke’s proof-of-concept attack [11].

Attaining sub-50 ns resolution places a significant restriction on the card-to-reader operating distance. With our reader, the card needs to be within a few millimeters to operate in this voltage range, meaning the user would need to touch the card on the reader. This reduction in operating range is a disadvantage, though it is worth noting that such fine resolution is only required to detect short-range attacks using sophisticated and expensive relay equipment. In high-risk applications, such as large-value contactless payment or high-security physical access control, making the act of using the card more overt and deliberate by requiring very close proximity operation may be sensible.

With our reader, 300 ns resolution was attained in the 4-5 cm range. Better distance performance may be possible, and further investigation is required to assess the usable operating range. Our reader, powered from a USB port, could not operate a card at 10 cm, the maximum distance required by the standard. Reliable operation was limited to 7.5 cm.

### Future Work

Further investigation is needed into the impact of different RF noise environments on modulation and detection performance. Data should be gathered for a larger range of readers and cards. We suspect that ISO 14443 Type B cards may have better modulation performance at larger distances. Type B does not use 100% ASK in reader-to-card communications, unlike Type A, which needs a store of energy (capacitance) to continue operating during the short periods of carrier suspension. The availability of this reserve of power reduces the load that the card can apply to the antenna circuit to modulate the carrier.

Interestingly, the smart card manufacturer Infineon has recently applied for a patent [13] on a decoupling circuit that makes the power reservoir selectively unavailable when the card is modulating. They claim that the circuit improves the modulation performance at larger distances. It would be worth investigating whether this innovation can further improve the operating range and effective timing resolution for Type A cards using our proposed method.

### Conclusion

We have proposed the first symmetric key-based distance-bounding protocol that is resistant to "terrorist fraud" and provided a security analysis. Unlike previous proposals, our protocol is suitable for resource-constrained devices due to its computational efficiency. We have analyzed the unconventional requirements that distance-bounding protocols place on the communication channel, highlighting the importance of low latency over raw bit rate. In response, we proposed a novel approach to communication that leverages side-channel leakage, previously considered a security vulnerability, to address the requirements of distance-bounding protocols.

Our experimental results indicate that a modified form of load modulation, used in the style of our proposed side-channel leakage communication technique, can provide sufficient distance resolution to detect advanced relay attacks on ISO 14443 smart cards. Although our technique reduces the operating range of the smart card, we argue that it may not be necessary to incur the additional expense and complexity of implementing ultra-wideband radio for the distance-bounding communication channel, as suggested by Hancke and Kuhn [12].
