#### About Us
- **Pride in Our Work:** We take pride in our creative and sometimes chaotic work environment.
- **Innovation:** Crazy ideas are encouraged, and we are always open to new challenges.
- **Confidentiality:** While we can't disclose everything, we welcome your questions.
- **Hands-On Approach:** You simulate it; we build it.
- **Work in Progress:** Our mess is a sign of ongoing projects.
- **Diverse Skill Set:** Our toolbox extends beyond MATLAB to include a wide range of tools and techniques.
- **Reverse Engineering:** No device is safe from disassembly.
- **Passion:** We love what we do.

#### What We Do

#### Definitions
- **Hardware Trojan:** A malicious alteration of hardware that, under specific conditions, results in functional changes to the system.
- **Time Bomb Trojan:** Disables a system at a future time.
- **Data Exfiltration Trojan:** Leaks confidential information over a secret channel.

#### Why Is It a Threat?
- **Critical Role of Electronics:**
  - Storage and communication of confidential information
  - Management and control of important equipment
  - Critical national security applications and systems
- **Vulnerability Due to Globalization:** Chip design and fabrication are increasingly vulnerable to malicious alterations due to globalization.

#### What Can Be Altered?
- **HDL (Hardware Description Language) Code**
- **Source Code**
- **Circuit Diagrams**
- **IC Layouts**
- **FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays)**

**Definition:**
- **FPGA:** A semiconductor device containing programmable logic components and interconnects. To configure an FPGA, you specify its functionality using a logic circuit diagram or HDL code.

#### Our Demonstration Platform
- **Application:**
  - AES Encryption Engine
- **Hardware:**
  - Spartan 3E FPGA Board
  - PS2 Keyboard (for user input)
  - LCD Display (for cipher output)
- **Trojan:**
  - Once triggered by a request to encrypt a special keyword, the AES key is transmitted on a covert communication channel.

#### Trojan Insertion
- **Transmit Module:** Responsible for transmitting the data.
- **Trigger Module:** Activates the trojan when the special keyword is detected.

#### Trojan Demonstrations
- **Thermal:**
  - An external resistor is electrically modulated to create thermal emissions.
  - The microcontroller or other parts of the circuit are quickly saturated with operations, generating thermal emissions.
  - The thermal signal is sensed using an IR camera.
- **Optical:**
  - An external LED is electrically modulated at a rate undetectable by the human eye.
  - The optical signal is sensed using an optical-to-audio amplifier.
- **Radio:**
  - An external I/O pin is modulated to cause radio emissions.
  - The radio signal is sensed using a radio receiver and post-processed on a PC.

#### Conclusion
- **Emerging Threat:** Hardware Trojans are a new and emerging threat.
- **Systems at Risk:** Military systems, financial systems, and even household appliances are at risk.
- **Purpose of Our Work:** To demonstrate the dangers of Hardware Trojans.
- **Ongoing Research:** We are also working on developing detection schemes for Hardware Trojans.
