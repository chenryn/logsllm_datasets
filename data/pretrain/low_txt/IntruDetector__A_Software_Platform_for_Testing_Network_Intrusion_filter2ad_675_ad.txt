### Case Analysis and Statistical Analysis Results

**Case 1: Suspicious Session at Midnight**
- **Observation**: A session initiated at midnight from an external source is flagged as a masquerader. This session is generated by virtual simulation, which is difficult to produce through real simulation due to the need for access to the external machine.
- **Analysis**: The session downloaded sensitive system files, which could be used to crack user passwords. Since it originated from a local machine, it could have been initiated by an internal user or a compromised machine. The failure to identify this suspicious activity highlights the weakness of statistical analysis in detecting insider misuse.

**Case 2: Anomalous Session**
- **Observation**: A session that did not occur before is flagged as anomalous. This session is also generated by virtual simulation.
- **Analysis**: Although the session is suspicious, it is possible that it was initiated by an internal user on out-of-town business. Flagging this session as intrusive indicates that statistical analysis may trigger false alarms. This is due to the immaturity of the detection algorithm. If the algorithm can adapt to changes in user behavior, false alarms may be reduced.

**Case 3: SYN-flooding Denial-of-Service Attack**
- **Observation**: A SYN-flooding attack on the server, where the source of SYN messages is set to the local machine. The most commonly used service, XII, is targeted. This attack is simulated by virtual simulation.
- **Analysis**: It is possible but dangerous to emulate the attack by real simulation. The inability to detect the SYN-flooding attack is due to the simplicity of the historical profile. If the profile contained more information, such as the intensity of connections, it would be possible to detect denial-of-service attacks like SYN-flooding.

### Statistical Analysis Results

**Data Collection and Analysis**
- **Data Collected**: Three weeks' worth of data from the experimental environment, consisting of 16,922 TCP connections.
- **Key Findings**:
  - **HTTP Connections**: The number of HTTP connections is the highest.
  - **XII Service**: From the perspective of data transmitted, XII consumes more network bandwidth than other services, with the highest average number of packets or bytes per connection.
  - **Distribution of Services**: Figure 4 shows the distribution of services used by machine C1 to communicate with Server S1. XII is the most frequently used service, followed by FTP.

### Signature Analysis Results

**Security Rules Defined**
- **Rule 1**: Access to the server is restricted to the inside.
- **Rule 2**: The maximum number of concurrent connections to the server is 1000.

**Case Analysis**
- **Case 1: FTP Session**
  - **Observation**: The FTP session is not flagged as an intrusion since it does not violate any security rules.
  - **Analysis**: Although downloading sensitive files is abnormal, it cannot be detected due to the simplicity of the sensor, which only utilizes packet header information. Parsing the data part of packets is necessary to determine which files have been accessed.
- **Case 2: Telnet Session**
  - **Observation**: The telnet session is flagged as intrusive because it explicitly violates Rule 1.
- **Case 3: TCP SYN Events**
  - **Observation**: Some TCP SYN events are flagged as intrusions. When the total number of current connections reached 1000, all newly established connections were flagged as intrusive.
  - **Analysis**: While some malicious connections were identified, many normal activities were also flagged as intrusions, leading to many false alarms. To effectively detect such attacks, a simple rule is insufficient, and more sophisticated techniques must be applied.

### Conclusion and Future Work

**Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)**
- **Role**: IDSs play a crucial role in protecting information infrastructure.
- **Current Status**: Most current detection algorithms are not sufficiently mature, and extensive testing and further improvement are required.
- **Testbed Development**: We have developed a testbed for network intrusion detection algorithms, allowing tests in a real environment with a wide range of intrusive cases without compromising normal system operations.
- **Future Work**: Our future work will focus on developing new intrusive simulators and redesigning our system to conform to standards when they are finalized by the IDWG [10].
