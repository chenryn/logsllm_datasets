## Abstract
Abusers increasingly use spyware apps, account compromise, and social engineering to surveil their intimate partners, causing significant harm that can escalate to violence. This form of privacy violation, known as intimate partner surveillance (IPS), is challenging to address due to the physical access and trust inherent in such relationships. While previous research has focused on the experiences of survivors, this study presents the first measurement analysis of online forums where (potential) attackers discuss IPS strategies and techniques. In fields like cybercrime, child abuse, and human trafficking, studying perpetrators' online behaviors has led to better threat intelligence and methods to combat these issues. Our aim is to provide similar insights for IPS.

We identified five online forums containing discussions on monitoring cellphones and other means of surveilling an intimate partner, including three within the context of investigating relationship infidelity. We conducted a mixed-methods analysis of these forums, uncovering the tools and tactics used by attackers. Through qualitative analysis, we developed a taxonomy of IPS strategies and synthesized lessons for technologists aiming to curb the spread of IPS.

## 1. Introduction
Technology-based intimate partner surveillance (IPS) causes severe harm. A distinct form of intimate partner violence (IPV), IPS involves the deliberate surveillance of an intimate partner, with or without their knowledge, using both technical and non-technical methods. Survivors have reported that abusers use spyware apps, account compromise, GPS trackers, shared cellular plans, and more to monitor their digital lives and physical locations. Prior work has also indicated that numerous IPS apps are available online and actively used against victims.

To better protect targets of abuse, it is essential to improve the robustness of technologies against abuse and to inform intervention approaches that directly aid victims. To achieve this, we need a deeper understanding of how those interested in perpetrating IPS learn to conduct these attacks. To date, few studies have investigated how attackers locate resources to facilitate abuse. Chatterjee et al. [6] noted the existence of blogs, videos, and Q&A sites that help facilitate IPS but did not explore the communities that use them. There is a methodological challenge in discovering this information: we need a way to hear from potential attackers directly.

In this study, we present the first exploration of how potential attackers use the internet to learn how to enact IPS against their victims. We identified five public online forums where people discuss infidelity in intimate relationships and tools for monitoring cellphones. We built a crawler to retrieve conversations from these forums, compiling a dataset of over 200,000 posts across nearly 20,000 threads. This dataset provides an unprecedented amount of information about the strategies of IPS attackers, contextualized in user-generated natural language. While prior work has described the attacks experienced by victims, our study offers a detailed view of how these attacks are created and developed, including the capabilities attackers seek, the vulnerabilities they exploit, and the community dynamics that enable them.

## 2. Background and Related Work
### IPV and Technology Abuse
Previous research has examined the behaviors, justifications, and tactics of intimate partner abusers, including the role of technology in IPV. Some studies have identified suspicions of infidelity as a leading trigger for IPV in heterosexual couples. A growing body of work explores how abusers exploit technology to monitor, harass, control, or otherwise harm their targets. Chatterjee et al. [6] observed that abusers likely exploit easy-to-find online resources, including tutorials, Q&A sites, and videos explaining how to use spyware for IPS. Roundy et al. [39] used datasets from a major antivirus vendor to explore a broader class of creepware, including spyware, SMS bombers, hacking tutorials, and more. These works have provided valuable intelligence for anti-IPS interventions with victims and survivors.

However, less research has examined the role of online communities in IPV. Some studies have explored how targets experience IPV in digital media and seek support through online forums, but to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first to measure and analyze how forums lead attackers to such tools. Our work confirms that attackers are discussing and recommending IPS strategies on public forums available to any internet user. We also identify new tactics, such as custom scripts to monitor websites visited and launch man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Online Measurement Studies
Prior work has used measurement and analysis of online forums to shed light on communities discussing criminal or malicious behaviors. For some of these communities, this research has led to the development of threat intelligence. Commercially motivated criminals, such as spammers and black-hat hackers, use online forums as marketplaces and to learn adversarial techniques from each other. Research on this phenomenon has identified structure, trust, and superusers in these communities. Similarly, online forums used by pedophiles and others involved in the creation and distribution of child sexual abuse materials have been studied to gain insights into the way participants justify or normalize abuse and share technical and non-technical strategies that facilitate abuse. Similar methods have also been used to analyze forums associated with hate groups, cyberbullying, doxxing, misinformation campaigns, harassment, and sex trafficking.

Our work falls into the latter category, focusing on people who use online forums to discuss strategies for IPS. Like the work on cybercrime and child abuse forums, our analysis aims to provide threat intelligence that can help combat IPS and IPV more broadly. Our research questions are:
- What role do online forums play in surfacing IPS resources to potential attackers?
- What role do commercially motivated entities play in these online communities?
- What tools and tactics are being suggested to potential attackers, and at what levels of technical sophistication?

## 3. Forums and Datasets
To answer these research questions, we performed a mixed-methods analysis of a large sample of posts and threads from public online forums with a high density of IPS-relevant conversation. In this section, we review our analysis targets and data collection approach, as well as the resulting datasets.

### Infidelity and IPS Forums
We identified several forums whose content includes a large number of posts touching on IPS. These were discovered through pointers from prior work [6] and online web searches using terms such as "spyware track wife." We restricted our attention to publicly available forums, excluding those accessible only to registered users or those requiring a threshold of active posts. We may have missed forums not easily found via search engines. Many forums have a small number of IPS-related posts, so we selected forums with a higher concentration of relevant content.

Our analyses focus primarily on three forums aimed at helping people navigate infidelity:
- **Forum A**: A community dedicated to discussing "investigative equipment," with an Alexa rank of approximately 500,000.
- **Forum B**: A community dedicated to advice on "detecting infidelity and deception," with an Alexa rank of approximately 900,000.
- **Forum C**: A moderated Reddit subforum that bills itself as "a safe place to ask for advice and guidance" for those facing infidelity in a relationship, with approximately 80,000 subscribers as of February 2020.

We also investigated two subforums that focus on spyware tools: **Forums D and E**, both subforums of a community for cellphone advice. Forum D focuses on spyware for mobile phones, while Forum E focuses on spyware generally. These subforums surfaced in internet searches for the same sets of IPS-related keywords as those used to discover the three infidelity forums above. Our analysis concluded that most content on these forums are spam advertisements for particular spyware tools.

### Data Collection
We collected data from Forums A, B, D, and E via custom crawlers built using Scrapy, an open-source, Python-based framework for web scraping. Our crawlers preserved the threaded structure of each forum's content, as well as metadata like views and post and update timestamps. We did not download any media beyond text, specifically avoiding images, and stored all data in a local database on a secured server. Our analysis covers a set of scrapes collected in October 2019.

For Forum C, we used the scrape available via the Reddit corpus within ConvoKit [5], which was collected in October 2018. Table 1 summarizes the complete dataset.

### Limitations
Our study combines quantitative and qualitative methodologies to characterize a sampling of publicly available forums where discussion of IPS tactics manifests. We emphasize that our work may not generalize to discussion on private forums, such as those requiring account creation and a threshold of posts or months active for access, or those occurring within private social groups on larger social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. We also focus on English-language forums, so our findings cannot represent the scope of IPS discussion worldwide. Future research could investigate larger public-facing communities, such as other subreddits or closed communities on influential social networks.

### Ethics
Throughout this work, we were sensitive to the ethics of using online discussions of highly personal topics for research. Our data is from publicly available fora accessible on the internet without authentication. Our IRB office reviewed the study and deemed it not to be human-subjects research since all data was already in the public domain. We took precautions to ensure our research remained safe and privacy-preserving. We used only the public usernames associated with each post and did not pursue identification of people from their posts or usernames or collect or store images. In reporting our work, we have scrubbed information that might trace back to the people behind the pseudonyms, such as locations or specific narrative details.

## 4. Forum Activity and Users
We begin by measuring the nature of activity on these forums. Later, we use qualitative methods to more deeply characterize their content.
