I am currently using the `Drawer` component in the navigation bar along with the `MenuIcon`. In previous releases, this functionality worked as expected: clicking the `MenuIcon` would open the `Drawer`, and clicking on any of the `Drawer` items or outside the `Drawer` would close it. However, in the latest release, I have noticed an issue. Once the `Drawer` is opened, if I click anywhere to close it, the `MenuIcon` becomes highlighted. I then have to click again on the page to return it to its normal state.

### Issue Summary
- **Expected Behavior**: Clicking the `MenuIcon` opens the `Drawer`, and clicking outside the `Drawer` or on any `Drawer` item closes it.
- **Actual Behavior**: After opening the `Drawer`, clicking anywhere to close it results in the `MenuIcon` being highlighted. An additional click is required to return the `MenuIcon` to its normal state.
