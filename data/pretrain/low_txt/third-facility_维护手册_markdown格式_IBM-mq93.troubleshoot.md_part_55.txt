#### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Send Collected Information to IBM:**
   - A detailed description of the problem and the associated data is the most crucial information you can provide to IBM.
   - **Important:** Do not send data without a clear description.

2. **FTP and Email Instructions:**
   - For guidance on how to send information via FTP or email, see "Exchanging information with IBM Software Support."

3. **Case Management:**
   - To open or update a support case, visit the [IBM My Support site](https://www.ibm.com/mysupport).
   - **Note:** Always update your case to indicate that data has been sent.

4. **Contacting IBM Software Support:**
   - If you need to speak with IBM Software Support, contact your country representative.
   - For support in the US, call 1-800-IBM-SERV (1-800-426-7378).

### Generating and Collecting Troubleshooting Information

#### Overview
After generating and collecting troubleshooting information, you can send it to IBM to assist with problem determination for a support case.

#### Key Points
- **Description and Data:**
  - When sending troubleshooting information, a comprehensive description of the problem and the data is essential.
  - **Important:** Do not send data without a description.

#### Procedure
1. **FTP and Email Instructions:**
   - Follow the instructions in "Exchanging information with IBM Software Support" for problem determination.

2. **Case Management:**
   - Go to the [IBM My Support site](https://www.ibm.com/mysupport) to open or update a case.
   - **Note:** Always update your case to indicate that data has been sent.

3. **Contacting IBM Software Support:**
   - Contact your country representative if you need to speak with IBM Software Support.
   - For support in the US, call 1-800-IBM-SERV (1-800-426-7378).

#### Additional Resources
- **IBM Support Guide:**
  - For more information about IBM Support, including how to register for support, see the [IBM Support Guide](https://www.ibm.com/support/guide).

- **Automated Collection:**
  - Use the `runmqras` command to gather troubleshooting information into a single archive. See “Collecting troubleshooting information automatically with runmqras” on page 303 for details.

- **Manual Collection:**
  - In some cases, you may need to collect troubleshooting information manually, such as when running an older version of IBM MQ or if the `runmqras` command is unavailable. See “Collecting troubleshooting information manually” on page 306 for more information.

### Using Error Logs for Problem Determination

#### Overview
Error logs are valuable tools for problem determination and troubleshooting. The type and location of error logs vary depending on the platform.

#### Multiplatforms (AIX, Linux, and Windows)
- **Error Log Directories:**
  - At installation, an `errors` subdirectory is created in `/var/mqm` under AIX and Linux, and in the installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\IBM\MQ`) under Windows.
  - This directory can contain up to three error log files:
    - `AMQERR01.LOG`
    - `AMQERR02.LOG`
    - `AMQERR03.LOG`

- **Queue Manager Error Logs:**
  - After creating a queue manager, three error log files are generated when needed, each with a default capacity of 32 MB.
  - These files are placed in the `errors` subdirectory within the queue manager's data directory (e.g., `/var/mqm/qmgrs/qmname` on AIX and Linux, and `C:\Program Files\IBM\MQ\qmgrs\qmname\errors` on Windows).

- **Error Log Rotation:**
  - When `AMQERR01.LOG` reaches its maximum size, it is renamed to `AMQERR02.LOG`, and the new `AMQERR01.LOG` is created. This ensures that the latest error messages are always in `AMQERR01.LOG`.

- **Access Restrictions:**
  - Users and applications must be members of the `mqm` group to have read and write access to queue manager error log directories and logs.

- **Ignoring Error Codes:**
  - On AIX and Linux, specify error codes to ignore in the `QMErrorLog` stanza.
  - On Windows, use the registry key `HKLM\Software\IBM\WebSphere MQ\Installation\MQ_INSTALLATION_NAME\IgnoredErrorCodes` to exclude specific error codes from the Application Event Log.

#### z/OS
- **Error Log Locations:**
  - Error messages are written to the z/OS system console and the channel-initiator job log.
  - For more information, see “Troubleshooting IBM MQ for z/OS problems” on page 247.

- **Suppressing Messages:**
  - Use the z/OS message processing facility to suppress console messages. For more information, refer to IBM MQ for z/OS concepts.

#### IBM i
- **Error Log Directories:**
  - At installation, a `/QIBM/UserData/mqm/errors` subdirectory is created in the IFS.
  - Error logs are located in `/QIBM/UserData/mqm/qmgrs/qmname/errors` if the queue manager name is known and available, or in `/QIBM/UserData/mqm/errors` if the queue manager is not available.

- **Error Log Files:**
  - The `errors` subdirectory can contain up to three error log files:
    - `AMQERR01.LOG`
    - `AMQERR02.LOG`
    - `AMQERR03.LOG`

- **Error Log Rotation:**
  - When `AMQERR01.LOG` exceeds 2 MB, it is copied to `AMQERR02.LOG`, and `AMQERR02.LOG` is copied to `AMQERR03.LOG`. The previous contents of `AMQERR03.LOG` are discarded.

- **Access Control:**
  - By default, only members of the `QMQMADM` group can access error logs. To grant access to other users, set `ValidateAuth` to `No` and grant those users `*PUBLIC` authority.
