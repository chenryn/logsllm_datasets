## Abstract
With the maturation of e-service infrastructures, organizations are increasingly incorporating Web services into their business processes. While some Web services may be used in isolation, it is more common for them to be integrated into workflows. The composition of e-workflows differs from traditional workflows due to the large number of available Web services, their heterogeneity, and their autonomy. This process raises two main challenges: efficient discovery of Web services and their seamless integration with the workflow host. To address these issues, we propose a solution based on ontologies. We have developed an algorithm and prototype that workflow systems can use to discover Web services with desired interfaces and operational metrics, and to assist designers in resolving heterogeneity issues among Web services. Our approach enhances Web service discovery and integration.

Workflow management systems (WfMSs), quality of service (QoS), workflow composition, web services, business process management.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet has transformed organizational and working models, with e-services emerging as a significant new wave of Internet-based business applications. As e-service infrastructures mature, organizations are expected to integrate Web services into their business processes. Workflow management systems (WfMSs) can efficiently set up e-services at low cost and in a short time (Shegalov et al., 2001).

E-service workflows face two primary challenges:
1. **Web Service Discovery:** Efficiently locating Web services with the desired functionality and operational metrics.
2. **Integration:** Resolving structural and semantic differences between discovered Web services and the e-workflow host.

Our work aims to enhance WfMSs with better mechanisms for Web service discovery and integration. We leverage ontologies to describe Web service interfaces and a QoS model to capture operational metrics. Ontology-based approaches have proven effective for information integration and interoperability (Uschold and Gruninger, 1996).

This paper is structured as follows:
- Section 2 outlines the challenges in e-workflow composition.
- Section 3 discusses the extension of traditional workflow task specifications to include semantic descriptions and QoS metrics.
- Section 4 details our approach to Web service discovery and integration.
- Section 5 presents our conclusions.

## 2. Challenges in E-Workflow Composition
E-services can be orchestrated using hard-coded applications or workflows. In this context, an e-workflow manages both e-services and traditional workflow tasks. During e-workflow composition, the designer manually selects tasks from a repository to model a business process. A workflow consists of logical steps (tasks or activities), dependencies, routing rules, and participants. Tasks can represent human activities or software systems, including Web services.

### 2.1 Task Selection
Finding a traditional task from a repository is manageable because the number of tasks is limited (typically tens to a few hundred). However, the number of available Web services can be vast, making manual discovery impractical. Therefore, efficient discovery mechanisms are essential.

### 2.2 Integration
Once a Web service is found, its interfaces may not perfectly match those of the e-workflow. Web services are inherently heterogeneous, requiring manual effort to establish connections and resolve structural and semantic differences. Mechanisms that suggest optimal connections to maximize integration are necessary.

### 2.3 Operational Metrics
Operational metrics, such as QoS, are critical in e-workflows. Trading agreements modeled in e-workflows specify items like delivery deadlines, product quality, and service costs. Proper management of these metrics is crucial for the success of e-commerce and e-services.

## 3. Task and Web Service Specifications
We use ontologies to semantically describe task and Web service interfaces. Semantics enhance information discovery and integration (Fensel and Musen, 2001). An ontology is an "explicit specification of a conceptualization" (Gruber, 1993), which helps in integrating heterogeneous tasks and Web services.

### 3.1 Semantic Description
In our implementation, task and Web service interfaces are described using concepts defined in DAML+OIL ontologies (Horrocks et al., 2001). This facilitates the resolution of structural and semantic heterogeneity. For Web services, we use DAML-S (Ankolekar et al., 2001) to specify the Service Profile ontology, which describes the functionality of a Web service.

### 3.2 Quality of Service (QoS)
Operational metrics are described using a QoS model. QoS addresses the operational aspects of workflow components, such as timeliness, product quality, and reliability. We have developed a theoretical model for automatically computing workflow QoS based on task QoS metrics (Cardoso et al., 2002a, 2002b). This model allows for the discovery of Web services based on operational metrics.

## 4. Web Service Discovery and Integration
We have developed an algorithm and a system to discover Web services and facilitate their integration into e-workflows. The system determines the best mapping between a service template (ST) and a service object (SO) to achieve the highest degree of integration.

### 4.1 Match Function
The key operation is the match function, which finds correspondences between a ST and SO. During the discovery phase, the match function evaluates the similarity between a ST and a set of SOs advertised in a registry. The system ranks SOs based on their similarity and suggests connections that maximize integration. Users can then select the most suitable Web service and resolve any remaining schematic differences.

### 4.2 Similarity Measures
- **Syntactic Similarity:** Based on attributes like service names and descriptions.
- **Operational Similarity:** Based on QoS metrics, such as timeliness, quality, and cost.
- **Semantic Similarity:** Uses ontological concepts to evaluate the similarity of interface parameters, addressing structural and semantic heterogeneity.

## 5. Conclusion
The emergence of Web services and e-services presents new challenges for organizations. Designing workflows that manage these services requires mechanisms for efficient Web service discovery and integration. Our approach, based on ontologies, accounts for syntactic, operational, and semantic dimensions. This allows for the discovery of Web services based on both functional and operational requirements, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of e-workflows.
