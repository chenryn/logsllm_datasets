**United States Radio Spectrum Allocation Overview**

This document provides an overview of the U.S. radio spectrum, including non-government exclusive, government/non-government shared, and government-exclusive allocations. The color legend and activity codes are as follows:

- **Not Allocated**: No specific service is assigned.
- **Radiolocation**: Used for radar and other location-finding services.
- **Radionavigation**: Used for navigation aids, such as GPS and beacons.
- **Fixed Services**: Point-to-point communication between fixed locations.
- **Maritime Mobile**: Communication for ships and maritime operations.
- **Aeronautical Mobile**: Communication for aircraft.
- **Aeronautical Radionavigation**: Navigation aids for aircraft, including radio beacons.
- **Broadcasting**: AM and FM radio, and television broadcasting.
- **Amateur Radio**: Non-commercial, personal use by licensed operators.
- **Standard Frequency and Time Signal**: Reference signals for time and frequency synchronization.
- **Space Research and Earth Exploration Satellites**: Used for scientific research and earth observation.
- **Mobile (Distress and Calling)**: Emergency communication channels.
- **Radio Astronomy**: Scientific research in radio astronomy.

**Frequency Bands and Their Allocations**

- **3 kHz to 300 kHz**: Low-frequency (LF) band, primarily used for long-distance communication and navigation.
- **300 kHz to 3 MHz**: Medium-frequency (MF) band, used for AM radio broadcasting and maritime communication.
- **3 MHz to 30 MHz**: High-frequency (HF) band, used for long-distance communication, including shortwave radio.
- **30 MHz to 300 MHz**: Very high-frequency (VHF) band, used for FM radio, television, and aeronautical communication.
- **300 MHz to 3 GHz**: Ultra high-frequency (UHF) band, used for television, mobile communication, and radionavigation.
- **3 GHz to 30 GHz**: Super high-frequency (SHF) band, used for satellite communication and radar.
- **30 GHz to 300 GHz**: Extremely high-frequency (EHF) band, used for high-capacity data transmission and advanced radar systems.
