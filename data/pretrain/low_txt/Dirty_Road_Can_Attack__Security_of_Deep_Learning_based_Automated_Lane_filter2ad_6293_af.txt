### Physical-World Robustness in Adversarial Attacks

Various techniques have been developed to enhance the physical-world robustness of deep learning models, such as non-printability scores [4, 93–95], low-saturation colors [5], and Expectation over Transformation (EoT) [4, 5, 29, 30]. These methods are primarily focused on image classification and object detection. In contrast, our work is the first to systematically design physical-world adversarial attacks on Automated Lane Centering (ALC) systems, which present unique and challenging design requirements (§3.3).

### Conclusion

In this study, we are the first to comprehensively examine the security of Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based ALC systems in their intended operational environments under physical-world adversarial attacks. We introduce a novel attack vector, the "dirty road patch," and develop an optimization-based attack generation method with innovative input generation and objective function designs. Our evaluation on a production ALC system using real-world traces demonstrates that our attack achieves over 95% success rates, with success times significantly lower than average driver reaction times. The attack also exhibits high robustness, generality, physical-world realizability, and stealthiness.

We conducted experiments using both simulation and a real vehicle, finding that our attack can cause a 100% collision rate in various scenarios. We also evaluated and discussed potential defenses. Given the widespread use of ALC systems and the safety implications highlighted in this paper, we hope our findings and insights will draw community attention and inspire further research.
