### Case Study: Customer Route Flapping

One of ISP-Anon's customers experienced a low event rate that most monitoring tools failed to detect. However, Stemming was able to identify the issue, and TAMP animation clearly illustrated it. Figure 7 shows a snapshot of the animation.

This customer has a direct connection via the next hop 1.0.0.1, but the associated BGP peering session would not remain stable. It was dropped and re-established on average every minute. The customer also has a backup link through a Network Access Point (NAP) connected to other Tier-1 ISPs. When the one-hop direct path fails, the traffic immediately fails over to a three-hop alternate path via another Tier-1 ISP.

Figure 7 illustrates the stability of the direct path between ISP-Anon and the customer. The green line represents the preferred route (pop1-1.0.0.1-custAS-customer), while all other routes (gray) are suppressed. Each point of presence (PoP) peers with different Tier-1 ISPs, and each makes independent routing decisions. This results in multiple alternate paths being announced. The convergence details vary slightly from event to event, depending on the relative timing of updates from the core route reflectors and the access routers peering with various downstream ISPs. On average, it takes about 20 seconds for everything to converge, generating approximately 200 BGP events per customer flap. The animation captures the intermediate states of route preferences as they come into effect. This oscillation continued for more than 1.5 months, and the timeline in Figure 7 shows a few minutes out of this period.

### Additional Data Sources

A single type of data source is often insufficient for diagnosing complex network and routing issues. In this section, we describe the integration of information from router configuration files, traffic flows, and IGP routing data into our techniques to address the limitations of using only BGP events.

#### 5.1 Integration with Internal Routing Policies

BGP routing policies within an Autonomous System (AS) are defined through router configurations and stored in configuration files. These policies influence routing decisions but are not visible in BGP events and are considered private to the AS. There are many types of routing policies, such as access lists to filter out routes from certain routers, configurations to advertise only locally originated routes, and preferences for routes from specific peers. The BGP community attribute is particularly used to dynamically influence routing decisions.

Understanding the interactions between intended policies and actual routing behaviors is crucial. Even if each router is configured as intended, an unexpected change can lead to suboptimal or unacceptable behaviors. Section 4.4 describes how policies tied to the BGP community attribute can be powerful when everything is functioning as anticipated, but during instability, compounded interactions can lead to disastrous results.

We have deduced part of Berkeley’s routing policies by studying its BGP events. However, without examining the content of configuration files, it is difficult to know all the complex policies defined internally. We are working on automatically correlating routing changes with routing policies. For example, retrieving router configuration files from the two Berkeley BGP peers and correlating their policies with BGP events in real-time. Recent work [5] presents a methodology for reverse-engineering network design through static analysis of router configuration files. We can use similar parsing techniques to extract route preference policies. The results from Stemming can be matched with these policies to pinpoint costly policy interactions and provide hints to network operations.

#### 5.2 Integration with Traffic Data

Internet traffic exhibits the "elephant and mice phenomenon," where a small percentage of prefixes (the elephants) account for the majority of the traffic volume, and the rest (the mice) use very little bandwidth. For example, 10% of the prefixes can be associated with 90% of the traffic, and 90% of the prefixes are tied to only 10% of the traffic. Our techniques use prefix counts and event counts as metrics, weighing each prefix equally. Combining these techniques with traffic data would provide additional capabilities.

In Section 4, we discuss a "Load Balancing Unbalanced" incident at Berkeley, where a misconfiguration resulted in one path carrying four times more prefixes than the other. However, due to the elephant and mice phenomenon, the severity of this incident depends on the traffic volume linked to the two sets of prefixes. Collecting traffic flow information using Cisco NetFlow on the outbound interfaces to the two rate limiters can help measure the imbalance in terms of bandwidth consumption. To achieve effective load balancing, we need to correlate routing and traffic data and compute traffic volume for each routing prefix. This would allow us to compute a more fine-grained prefix load balancing without trial-and-error steps. We are in the process of integrating traffic data into our techniques. In TAMP visualization, edge weights would be computed based on traffic volume inferred from routing data combined with NetFlow traffic flow records collected at selected border routers.

#### 5.3 Integration with IGP

The BGP route selection process works in conjunction with Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) to compute the best route for a prefix. Changes in IGP, such as link metrics, can cause a router to reselect a different BGP best route. In our work, we feed only BGP events to the Stemming algorithm. We then use REX, which temporally synchronizes BGP and IGP routing messages, to manually drill down and determine whether IGP is part of the root cause of an incident. The volume of IGP routing messages (e.g., LSAs in OSPF) is significantly lower than BGP, making it convenient to correlate LSAs with a BGP incident after it is discovered. We are working on automating this process as part of Stemming.

### Related Work

In this section, we discuss related work. Most network operators use "home-grown" tools to monitor the routing state of their networks. Researchers at U.C. Davis’s Elisha project [10] have developed visualization techniques to improve understanding of Internet routing dynamics. The BGPlay Java plugin [1] from RIPE NCC visualizes BGP routing activity for a single prefix within a time interval. The TAMP techniques presented in this paper can animate any set of prefixes.

Several researchers are investigating BGP root-cause analysis. Caesar et al. [2] and Feldmann et al. [3] have developed algorithms to pinpoint the root causes of Internet routing dynamics. Teixeira and Rexford [9] highlight the limitations of using BGP data from a single vantage point and propose techniques to address them.

These papers advocate for global coordination among ASs, allowing one AS to peek into another’s network when diagnosing routing problems. While a laudable goal, this inter-AS framework would require significant commercial incentives to deploy, as most ISPs guard their internal network data. Our work focuses on what is currently possible with commonly deployed inter-domain routing practices within a network’s scope of administrative control. Through real-life observations, we show that the operationally oriented information provided by our techniques is a useful first step in diagnosing routing problems in the Internet.

### Status and Conclusions

We first presented this work at the North America Network Operators Group 30th meeting, where it was well-received. The TAMP visualization and Stemming analysis techniques have been adopted by the Packet Design Route Explorer (REX) product as part of its BGP diagnostics and analytics solution. REX consolidates data from multiple routing protocols and computes a real-time, network-wide routing map. It allows users to monitor the overall routing topology of a network as it changes, providing both a current and historical view. It also offers features for drilling down to show details of routing state. We have installed REX with our extensions at large universities, enterprises, public providers, and major Tier-1 ISPs. Preliminary reactions from these installation sites have been very positive. As they use TAMP and Stemming to detect and diagnose BGP misbehavior, we hope to gather feedback and further improve our techniques.

In this paper, we have presented challenges in understanding the inter-domain routing system of today’s Internet. It is crucial to diagnose routing problems, especially subtle ones, quickly and accurately. Our results from applying the techniques to a Tier-1 ISP and a large university network show that the techniques can help diagnose a wide range of routing anomalies. We also discovered unexpected interactions between intended routing policy and actual behavior, which would otherwise be nearly impossible to detect in an operational environment. The tools have been incorporated into a commercial product as part of a BGP diagnostics solution. Installations of this product in various network settings have been well-received by customers.
