# Security and Management of Audit Logs: A Comprehensive Review

## Abstract
This paper explores the current state of security schemes for audit logs and their management, comparing various features to identify deficiencies. Our future work aims to develop a comprehensive, transparent solution that addresses these deficiencies and provides robust protection against reported threats and vulnerabilities. Additionally, we highlight the often-overlooked threat posed by insiders, particularly super users and administrators, and propose strategies to mitigate such risks.

## 1. Introduction
Audit logs are critical for ensuring the security and integrity of computing environments. This paper reviews existing security schemes for audit logs, identifies their features, and draws comparisons to segregate and address deficiencies. We also emphasize the need to consider insider threats, which are often neglected in current research.

## 2. Literature Review
### 2.1 Existing Schemes and Comparisons
We have explored various available schemes for securing audit logs and managing them. These schemes are compared based on their features, and a detailed review is provided to identify their strengths and weaknesses.

### 2.2 Deficiencies in Current Approaches
After reviewing the existing literature, we have identified several deficiencies in current audit log management applications. These include:
- Lack of comprehensive solutions
- Inadequate transparency
- Insufficient protection against reported threats and vulnerabilities

### 2.3 Insider Threats
Our review also highlights that insider threats, particularly from super users and administrators, are often overlooked. Organizations typically place blind faith in these individuals, which can be a significant security risk. It is essential to address these insider threats to enhance the overall security of information systems and log management systems.

## 3. Future Work
In our future work, we plan to develop a comprehensive solution that provides the following features:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that log data is not accessible to unauthorized individuals.
- **Integrity**: Assuring the consistency, completeness, and accuracy of log data.
- **Availability**: Ensuring that log data remains accessible even after a system compromise.
- **Authenticity**: Confirming that recorded evidence is genuine and unaltered.
- **Immutability**: Preventing any modifications to recorded evidence under any circumstances.
- **Heterogeneity Support**: Managing logs generated by different devices in a meaningful way.
- **Semantics**: Enriching log entries to make them understandable and taggable.
- **Statistics Sharing**: Providing real-time statistics to increase the trustworthiness of cloud services.

## 4. Conclusion
A secure and mission-critical computing environment must have an audit log management system that ensures confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, immutability, heterogeneity support, semantics, and statistics sharing. Addressing these requirements will help in creating a more robust and secure environment, especially against insider threats.
