We are delighted to welcome you to the 2015 ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security (AISec 2015) — the eighth annual event that focuses on integrating intelligent systems into computer security applications and exploring the implications of these approaches. The primary goal of this workshop is to advance research at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, privacy, and security. AISec provides a unique platform for interdisciplinary discussions among researchers and practitioners working in one or more of these fields, fostering cross-pollination of ideas and techniques.

This year's program features a diverse range of topics, including adversarial learning, detection of fake online social network (OSN) accounts, malware classification, privacy-preserving data processing, and game-theoretic techniques in adversarial learning. We are honored to be co-located with the premier ACM Computer and Communication Security (CCS 2015) conference.

We received 25 submissions from Asia, Europe, and North America. After a rigorous review process involving 2-3 referees per paper, 11 papers were accepted for presentation, including some presentation-only papers.

The success of AISec 2015 is a result of the collaborative efforts of colleagues from institutions around the world. We extend our sincere gratitude to the AISec program committee and external reviewers for their invaluable contributions to ensuring a strong and high-quality program. We also thank the authors for their excellent submissions and the thoughtful feedback provided by the reviewers.

Special thanks go to the ACM CCS organizers, particularly the workshop chairs Xiaofeng Wang and Kui Ren, and the CCS General Chair Indrajit Ray, for providing a suitable forum and their continued support for this workshop.

We believe that the workshop program will be of great interest not only to researchers in the field but also to practitioners and academics in other areas of security. We look forward to seeing you all in Denver this year.
