**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Transient Cyber Asset

Adversaries may target devices that are transient across Industrial Control System (ICS) networks and external networks. Typically, these transient assets are introduced into an environment by authorized personnel and are not permanently installed. These devices are often necessary for supporting management functions and may be more prevalent in systems where remote management is not feasible, external connections for remote access are unavailable, or third-party contractor/vendor access is required.
