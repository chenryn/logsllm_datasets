### Top Content Categories

**Figure 4.** Top 10 content categories of sites using (i) Service Workers (SWs, in blue) and (ii) SWs that communicate with advertisers (in red). As shown, SWs are widely used in sites delivering content related to "News and Media" and "Computers, Electronics, and Technology." (Color figure online)

### Data Collection and Analysis

**Initial Crawl:**
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
- **Objective:** Sufficient time for a Service Worker (SW) to register and make the first connection with the corresponding server(s).
- **Observation Period:** 5 months (April 2021)
- **Revisit:** Websites from the initial Tranco list to observe changes in the ecosystem, such as sites dropping or adopting SWs.

**Table 1.** Summary of the collected data.

**Data Analysis:**
- **Classification:** To categorize the network traffic generated by registered SWs, we utilized the 1Host filterlist [16] to flag ad-related domains in our web logs.
- **Site Categorization:** We employed SimilarWeb [17] to classify the sites registering SWs based on the content they deliver.

**Historical Analysis and Static Detection:**
- **Heuristics and Keywords:** We extracted heuristics and keywords from our set of SW-registering sites to identify the registration or use of SWs.
- **Crawler Development:** A crawler was developed to statically detect the registration of SWs in these sites.
- **Time Travel:** Using the Wayback Machine [18] and the waybackpy Python package [19], we traced back to the exact day when these websites started deploying SWs in their visitors' browsers.

**Ethical Considerations:**
- **User Data:** No user data was gathered or used during this study.
- **Site Operation:** The proper operation of the sites we crawled was not impeded or tampered with in any way.
- **Research Scope:** Our research was strictly limited to passively monitoring the behavior of SWs.
