Bogons, or IP addresses that are not allocated or routed on the Internet, can be useful in various contexts, such as identifying potential trademark infringements. In our study, we identified two known malicious campaigns within a subset of bogon data: "Operation Hangover" and "CopyKittens."

**Operation Hangover** is a cyber espionage threat targeting government, military, and private sector networks, with some ties to India [17]. The domain names associated with this threat, as seen in active DNS data, are listed in the left column of Table 3.

**CopyKittens** is another threat infrastructure targeting high-ranking diplomats at Israelâ€™s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and well-known Israeli academic researchers specializing in Middle East Studies [33]. The domain names for this threat are shown in the right column of Table 3.

These indicators remain valuable even if the attacks are known and likely inactive. Neutered, yet unidentified, infections may still be present in networks, necessitating incident responses and damage assessments. For instance, knowing the specific internal machine infected with targeted malware is crucial, as the implications vary depending on whether it is an end-user machine on a corporate network, a locked-down server in a data center, or the CEO's personal laptop.

Interestingly, some targeted threats resolve to bogon space while active, to reduce their network footprint [27]. This suggests that non-routable IPs in active DNS can serve as signals for malicious detection.

The collection of passive DNS data has been proposed by Weimer et al. [35] over a decade ago as a method for network operators to investigate security events. Zdrnja et al. [36] were the first to discuss how passive DNS data can be used to spot security incidents using domain names. Notos [12] and Exposure [15] used the idea of building passive DNS reputation through statistical modeling of resolved DNS traffic. Plonka et al. [29] introduced Treetop, a scalable way to manage and correlate passive DNS data. Since then, several researchers have used proprietary passive DNS data to build systems for detecting Internet abuse [13, 14, 16, 24, 26, 31].

Passive DNS is considered a valuable tool for network operators and security researchers. Our active DNS project aims to provide researchers with open access to DNS datasets, comparable to passive DNS, but without concerns about personally identifiable information (PII) or legal barriers.

There have been many commercial and national efforts to create passive DNS repositories. However, the costs of commercial offerings often pose a barrier for researchers and network operators. Some national efforts are hindered by DNS policy, limiting their adoption. PassiveDNS.cn, for example, was quickly dismissed due to its unreliable nature, as the collected DNS records were already censored by egress sensors. In contrast, our project does not censor the views of the recursive DNS servers used to resolve seed domain names daily.

In terms of active scanning, most efforts have come from the industry. Recently, new work from the academic community [20] has provided the ability to scan the entire IPv4 space for open security research. While Censys was not designed to scan the domain name space, our work complements it and is specifically designed for DNS scanning.

### 6. Conclusion

DNS is vital to the operation of the Internet, relied upon by users, systems, and services for most network communication. Malware also uses DNS to locate command-and-control (C&C) servers and provide network agility. Despite its importance, gaining access to large, open, and freely available DNS datasets is challenging, often due to privacy regulations or access restrictions. This limits the pool of security researchers who can leverage DNS in their work and the repeatability of existing DNS-based research.

To address this, we built Thales, a system to query and collect massive quantities of DNS data from publicly available lists of domains. We are releasing the resulting active DNS data to the public, derived from public sources, making it easily incorporable into new or existing research without privacy or access concerns.

Our analysis compared active DNS with a passive DNS dataset from a large university network. Active DNS data provides broader coverage, while passive DNS data offers a denser, more tightly connected graph. We provided case studies demonstrating how active DNS can facilitate new research or re-implement existing DNS-related research. By opening up active DNS to the security community, we hope to spur more and better research around DNS.
