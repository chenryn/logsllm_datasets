### Maximizing Sensor Coverage in a Metropolitan Area

The primary objective of a sensor network in a large metropolitan area is to maximize the coverage of the targeted region. The network aims to measure various conditions such as traffic, temperature, and social indicators that may require human feedback. While recent designs have incorporated humans as sensors, the fundamental goal remains the same: to achieve maximum sensor coverage over the designated area. This objective is distinct from maximizing the coverage of people, which has raised concerns about privacy. Privacy issues have primarily centered on the potential for individuals to be identified through posted sensor data, rather than being specifically targeted for surveillance. These concerns are typically addressed at the application level, not at the link-layer device level.

### Inaccuracies in Geolocation

One significant issue that has not been fully addressed is the potential for geolocation errors in the sensor network. Kim et al. [36] highlight the problem of inaccurate router geolocations in war driving databases, which can lead to further inaccuracies when these positions are used to determine the locations of other individuals via WiFi. Our approach uses smartphone positions for triangulation, and similar issues could arise. However, modern smartphones employ advanced GPS positioning techniques, combining GPS, cell-tower information, and available 802.11 access points to achieve high degrees of accuracy. We believe that the error in our system will be significantly lower than that reported by Kim et al., and we expect positional accuracy to improve over time as applications requiring precise location data become more prevalent.

### Conclusion

Wireless mobile devices are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in modern society. It is anticipated that smartphones will soon be as or more common than traditional cellphones and will serve as the primary internet access point for a large portion of the global population. Many individuals are unaware of the privacy implications associated with these devices. While previous research has focused on providing countermeasures to protect privacy, little has been done to quantify the potential for pervasive monitoring. Our study demonstrates that, with realistic 802.11g WiFi transmission distances and a small but significant fraction of the population participating in a sensor network (whether maliciously or otherwise), it is possible to track substantial portions of the population in metropolitan areas with high granularity over extended periods. We found that while population density has an effect, the specific geometry and building usage of the surveilled area can have a more significant impact. Changes in the radius of the tracking area also have a substantial effect on tracking capability without a significant loss in accuracy. Our results are based on conservative estimates, suggesting that the potential for privacy loss is even greater. The next generation 802.11n WiFi standard, which is expected to be widely adopted in wireless phones, will make tracking even easier and potentially compatible with malicious network compromises.

For the first time, the technology for creating a ubiquitous tracking network is within reach of digital criminals and small organizations. This means that the ability to physically track individuals is no longer limited to large nation-states and multinational telecommunications corporations but can now be wielded by smaller, less regulated groups. All that is required is a method to gather mobile nodes into a sensor network, either through legitimate software or malware, and a system to process the sensor data. The potential outcomes are concerning, and we recommend strongly considering and implementing both current and new methods to mitigate wireless detection.

In future work, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of different countermeasures that do not rely on analyzing the potential damage of widely known auxiliary information in deanonymizing subjects. Additionally, we seek to develop a way to normalize simulations so that they are independent of the simulated area's geometry.

As smartphones continue to become the norm, we must address the privacy implications of these devices. This is especially critical as computing power becomes more accessible and pervasive, and digital criminals find new ways to profit from insecurity.

**Figure 10:** Map of the Dallas Area created by the UDel Models group [4].

**Figure 11:** Map of the Chicago Area created by the UDel Models group [4].

In Figures 11 and 9, we see the area modeled in Chicago, specifically the 3 × 3 block area bounded on the north by W. Wacker Dr., the south by W. Washington St., the east by N. Clark St., and the west by N. Franklin St.

In Figures 10 and 8, we see the area modeled in Dallas, specifically the 4 × 4 block area bounded on the north by Pacific Ave., the south by Jackson St., the west by N. Field St., and the east by North St. Paul St.

In both cases, the figure on the right provides the simulator’s parameters, including the number of floors of the buildings and their designations as office (OF), residence (RE), or service building (SR). Some buildings have multiple designations, reflecting different uses for different levels. The UDel simulator uses this information for path and destination planning during simulations.
