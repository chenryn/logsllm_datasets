# Backscatter Analysis for Estimating Denial-of-Service Attack Activity in the Internet

## 1. Introduction
This paper introduces a new technique, "backscatter analysis," for estimating denial-of-service (DoS) attack activity in the Internet. Using this method, we observed widespread DoS attacks distributed across many different domains and ISPs. The size and duration of these attacks follow a heavy-tailed distribution, with a small number of long attacks constituting a significant fraction of the overall attack volume. Additionally, we noted a surprising number of attacks directed at a few foreign countries, home machines, and specific Internet services.

## 2. Data Breakdown

### 2.1 Victim Hostnames
Table 6 provides a breakdown of victim hostnames over three weeks:

| Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 19,118 | 25,305 | 17,192 |
| 16,716 | 24,645 | 26,880 |
| 9,869  | 13,054 | 8,513  |
| 956    | 343    | 1,018  |
| 461    | 2,289  | 6,476  |
| 453    | 2,796  | 451    |
| 2,698  | 4,055  | 682    |
| 393    | 5,674  | 730    |
| 156    | 71     | 292    |
| 7      | 3      | 1      |

### 2.2 Attacks and Packets
The number of attacks and packets (in thousands) are as follows:

#### Week 1
- **Attacks**: 1,985, 1,105, 275, 163, 88, 84, 76, 64, 35, 3
- **Packets (k)**: 32, 32, 17, 0.44, 2.9, 3.6, 5.2, 7.3, 0.09, 0.00

#### Week 2
- **Attacks**: 2,308, 1,307, 375, 276, 111, 90, 125, 134, 26, 2
- **Packets (k)**: 28, 43, 14, 1.6, 10, 0.72, 1.1, 1.2, 0.47, 0.00

#### Week 3
- **Attacks**: 1,985, 1,105, 275, 163, 88, 84, 76, 64, 35, 3
- **Packets (k)**: 32, 32, 17, 0.44, 2.9, 3.6, 5.2, 7.3, 0.09, 0.00

### 2.3 Autonomous Systems (ASes)
Figure 8 shows the distribution of attacks to 17 ASes that were targeted by at least 1% of all attacks. Each AS is associated with three values, one for each week, in progressive shades of grey. The ASes are sorted by overall attacks across all three weeks.

- **STARNETS** was the most attacked, receiving 4-5% of attacks.
- The ASes shown in Figure 8 accounted for 35% of all attacks, corresponding to only 3% of all ASes attacked.
- About 4% of attacks each week had no route according to our offline snapshot of global routes.

### 2.4 Repeated Attacks
Figure 9 presents a histogram of victims of repeated attacks. The x-axis shows the number of attacks to the same victim, and the y-axis shows the percentage of victims attacked a given number of times in logarithmic scale.

- **65%** of victims were attacked once.
- **18%** were attacked twice.
- **95%** were attacked five or fewer times.
- One host was attacked 48 times, with durations between 72 seconds and 5 hours.
- There are 5 outlier victims attacked 60-70 times, and one victim attacked 102 times in one week.

## 3. Validation
The backscatter hypothesis states that unsolicited packets represent responses to spoofed attack traffic. We validated this through:

- **Data Analysis**: 80% of attacks and 98% of packets are attributed to backscatter.
- **Comparison with Other Data**: Using data from Vern Paxson and Asta Networks, we found a close level of correspondence, confirming the backscatter hypothesis.

## 4. Related Work
Denial-of-service has been recognized as a problem, but research is limited. Existing work focuses on tolerance, diagnosis, and localization. Solutions include mitigating specific attacks, general system mechanisms, and IP traceback techniques.

## 5. Conclusions
Backscatter analysis provides a new method for estimating DoS attack activity in the Internet. Our observations show widespread and diverse DoS attacks, with a significant fraction of the attack volume coming from a small number of long attacks.
