### Resource Abuse for Malicious Actions

Resources are often exploited to carry out malicious activities, including DDoS attacks on remote targets, cryptojacking, hosting of illegal or malicious data, and darknet deployments. MarioNet, a specific type of attack, exacerbates the severity of these actions by providing two key characteristics: persistence and evasiveness. 

- **Persistence**: This allows an attacker to continue their malicious computations even after the user has navigated away from the initial malicious website.
- **Evasiveness**: MarioNet operates in a completely stealthy manner, bypassing existing in-browser detection mechanisms.

### Reevaluation of Web Trust Models

Our research highlights that the current web trust model, which considers web publishers as inherently trustworthy and allows them to execute client-side code without restrictions, is flawed and requires reevaluation. Additionally, this work aims to raise awareness about the powerful capabilities that modern browser APIs provide to attackers and to initiate a serious discussion on implementing necessary restrictions to prevent such abuse.
