### Analysis of Cross-Covariance and Outlier Detection for Electricity Theft

While we did not observe significant differences in the 25th percentile and median of the 107 cross-covariance values, their average and 75th percentile may be useful. Figure 6 suggests that a crafted attack pattern tends to exhibit a trend different from the consumption patterns of many other customers. Although this alone is not definitive evidence of an attack, it can be used as an additional factor for electricity theft detection, leveraging alarm fusion technologies.

In addition to cross-correlation, we can use outlier detection algorithms such as Local Outlier Factor (LOF) [7] to identify anomalies in electricity consumption patterns. We conducted preliminary analyses by smoothing daily electricity consumption patterns using a low-pass filter and then normalizing them to focus on shape and trend anomalies rather than high or low consumption levels. Figure 7 shows some samples of consumption patterns with top-5 (greater than 2.4) and low (less than 1.0) LOF scores. Inliers with low LOF scores are categorized into a few "typical" usage patterns, as shown in Figure 7(a), while unique patterns, including "artificial-looking" ones, are identified as outliers (Figure 7(b)). Future work will continue to explore this area.

### Use of Auto-correlation of Residuals in ARMA-GLR Detector

Based on the attack strategy tested in Section 3.2, we expect that the sequence of residuals of generated attack patterns will have high auto-correlation, which can indicate an attack. We explored this direction by using the Durbin-Watson statistic, defined as:

\[
d = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} e_i^2}{\sum_{i=2}^{N} (e_i - e_{i-1})^2}
\]

where \( e_i \) denotes the \( i \)-th residual and \( N \) is the number of measurements in the series. Generally, auto-correlation is inferred when \( d < 1.0 \). We added the test of auto-correlation in residuals for the ARMA-GLR detector. By setting the threshold for \( d \) around 1.0, we detected all attacks mounted against the ARMA-GLR detector as discussed in Section 3.2. The empirical relation between threshold values and the false positive rate, where false positives are counted based on the Durbin-Watson test, is shown in Figure 8(a).

Although the Durbin-Watson statistic is effective, it is not difficult to create attacks to defeat this measure. For example, a slightly modified attack strategy would give attackers almost the same gain as the original attack, resulting in a Durbin-Watson value of approximately 2.0, which would not be detected by the usual threshold. The trade-off curves in Figure 8(b) show similar results. The weakness of the Durbin-Watson statistic is that it only considers first-order auto-correlation. Using higher-order correlation tests, such as the Breusch-Godfrey Test or Ljung-Box Test, could make attacks more challenging. Future work will explore ways to improve our detectors against sophisticated attackers.

### Energy Efficiency

One of the goals of the smart grid is to incentivize users to reduce their electricity consumption. In some cases, such as the installation of solar panels, the utility company will know about the installation because personnel must approve it. However, in other cases, the incorporation of green-energy technology might be unknown to the utility, leading to false alarms in anomaly detection. To mitigate this, we can complement anomaly detection mechanisms with additional information, such as balance meters, and retrain models with new equipment in place. These changes are part of the non-stationarity of the random process considered in this work.

### Conclusions

This paper introduces the first rigorous study of electricity-theft detection from a computer-security perspective. While previous work has introduced methods for electricity-theft detection, we argue that incorporating adversarial classification metrics and considering adversarial learning are fundamental contributions to this growing area. Our results consider pessimistic scenarios, but we anticipate better performance under average conditions where the attacker does not know the algorithms or time intervals used for anomaly detection. Additionally, the proposed anomaly detectors will output indicators of an attack, and the utility company will combine this information with balance meters, smart meter tampering alarms, and field monitoring reports to achieve accurate electricity-theft reports.

Future work will include:
- Adding mechanisms that take advantage of the "shape" of the signal.
- Studying cross-correlation among nearby customers as an indicator of anomalies.
- Incorporating randomness in the use of training data to make the classifier's state unpredictable.
- Leveraging longer-period datasets to develop accurate seasonal models and correlate with factors like weather and temperature.
