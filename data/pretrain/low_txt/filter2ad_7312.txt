## Abstract
The DSN Workshop on Self-Stabilization features fifteen research presentations. The program covers a range of topics, including network protocols, sensor networks, distributed algorithms, methods for analyzing self-stabilization, fault tolerance in distributed systems, and techniques for constructing self-stabilizing systems.

## 1. Workshop Goals and Areas
Self-stabilization is distinct from other approaches to dependable systems. Unlike methods that rely on replication or safe storage to mask failures, or backward recovery to restore system state, self-stabilization focuses on forward recovery, tolerating any degree of transient failure. Although self-stabilization has long been a standard topic in distributed systems, recent interest has been driven by concerns about scalability and the increasing distribution of system control. Additionally, there is growing recognition that system components become more valuable if they are individually self-stabilizing.

The Self-Stabilizing Systems Workshop is held biennially and serves as a high-quality research forum, often in conjunction with major conferences such as ACM STOC (1995), ACM PODC (1997), IEEE ICDCS (1999), and DISC (2001). Many workshop results have been published in journals, including special issues dedicated to self-stabilization. These workshops have been instrumental in stimulating new adaptations of stabilization, discussing technical advances in algorithms and analysis, and introducing new problem areas and applications suited to the stabilization approach.

This year's workshop continued these themes with high-quality research presentations and open discussions on the latest results and future directions. In addition to the fifteen technical presentations, an invited presentation was given by Anish Arora.

## 2. Summary of Presentations
### Biological and Sensor Network Contributions
- **"Self-stabilizing pulse synchronization inspired by biological pacemaker networks"** (Ariel Daliot, Danny Dolev, Hanna Parnas) explores the synchronization of periodic pulse events in nodes, drawing inspiration from biological systems. The paper addresses Byzantine behavior in processes.
- **"A pursuer-evader game for sensor networks"** (Murat Demirbas, Anish Arora, Mohamed Gouda) investigates energy-efficient and self-stabilizing strategies in a pursuer-evader game in sensor networks. The study presents evader-centric, pursuer-centric, and hybrid approaches.
- **"Collision-free communication in sensor networks"** (Sandeep S. Kulkarni, Umamaheswaran Arumugam) solves the problem of diffusing information in wireless sensor/actuator networks without collisions, using staged time-division multiplexing.

### Network and Distributed System Protocols
- **"A stabilizing solution to the stable paths problem"** (Jorge A. Cobb, Mohamed G. Gouda, Ravi Musunuri) addresses routing stability in protocols like BGP. The paper uses diffusing computation to enable nodes to select stable paths.
- **"Route preserving stabilization"** (Colette Johnen, Sébastien Tixeuil) presents a self-stabilizing shortest path spanning tree algorithm for semi-uniform systems, ensuring route preservation and loop-free operation even under continuous cost changes.
- **"Self-stabilizing group communication in directed networks"** (Shlomi Dolev, Elad Schiller) generalizes previous work on undirected communication links to directed networks, covering token circulation and spanning tree structures.

### Theoretical Studies
- **"Self-stabilizing algorithms for {k}-domination"** (Martin Gairing, Stephen T. Hedetniemi, Petter Kristiansen, Alice A. McRae) develops a linear-time algorithm for achieving a {k}-dominating function in graphs.
- **"A method for evaluating efficiency of protocols on the asynchronous shared-state model"** (Yoshihiro Nakaminami, Toshimitsu Masuzawa, Ted Herman) provides a characterization of algorithms where asynchronous complexity can be derived from synchronous time complexity.
- **"An improved snap-stabilizing PIF algorithm"** (Lélia Blin, Alain Cournier, Vincent Villain) removes the assumption of knowing the network size in a snap-stabilizing solution for the Propagation of Information with Feedback.

### Additional Discussions
The workshop also included a general discussion session on future directions and open problems, providing an opportunity for researchers to exchange ideas and explore new challenges and opportunities in self-stabilization. The workshop papers are published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.

### Foundational Work on Self-Stabilization
- **"A framework of safe stabilization"** (Sukumar Ghosh, Alina Bejan) examines the intersection of self-stabilization and system safety, allowing systems to move to a known safe state even if full restoration is not possible.
- **"Self-stabilizing atomicity refinement allowing neighborhood concurrency"** (Sébastien Cantarell, Ajoy K. Datta) considers resource sharing in a network model, using a self-stabilizing transformer to allow more concurrency while hiding low-level activity.
- **"A new self-stabilizing k-out-of-(cid:1) exclusion algorithm on rings"** (Ajoy K. Datta, Rachid Hadid, Vincent Villain) proposes a new metric for evaluating (cid:1)-exclusion.
- **"A self-stabilizing algorithm for token circulation by using edge-tokens"** (Shing-Tsaan Huang, Su-Shen Hung) presents a uniform token-circulation algorithm with O(n) convergence time, improving on previous algorithms in terms of uniformity and stabilization time.

### Techniques for Constructing Self-Stabilizing Systems
- **"A general method for constructing self-stabilizing algorithms with logarithmic time complexity"** (Felix C. Gärtner, Henning Pagnia) shows how to reduce convergence time and improve fault containment by partitioning system components and using an overlay network.
- **"Lyapunov analysis of neural network stability in an adaptive flight control system"** (Sampath Yerramalla, Bojan Cukic, Martin Mladenovski, Edgar Fuller) links system adaptivity and self-stabilization, presenting a case study in an adaptive flight control system.
