## Abstract
Understanding which IP prefixes contain Internet users is crucial for interpreting various Internet analyses. However, existing datasets are often outdated, unvalidated, based on privileged data, or too coarse-grained. This paper introduces novel techniques to identify which IP prefixes host web clients using publicly available data. Our methods cover 98.8% of ASes and 95.2% of prefixes responsible for Microsoft CDN traffic, with less than 1% false positives. We present global measurements of Internet usage and discuss future directions for extending these techniques to measure relative activity levels across prefixes.

**CCS Concepts:**
- Networks → Network measurement.

- Network Mapping

## 1 Introduction
Knowing which networks host Internet users is essential for interpreting research results, operational aspects, and analysis weighting. For example, the impact of an outage, a slow route, or a network being added to a blocklist varies depending on whether the network has users. A 2015 study by Google [11] showed that while Google peered directly with 41% of networks overall, it peered with 61% of networks hosting end users. This highlights the importance of distinguishing between user-hosting and non-user-hosting networks in Internet analysis.

Existing datasets of end-user activity are private, unvalidated, out of date, or opaque. For instance, the 2015 study used a private CDN dataset that cannot be shared and is now outdated. Other studies have used BitTorrent swarms, ISI Internet Census data, and APNIC’s network population data, but these have limitations such as cost, coverage, and ethical concerns.

### New Techniques
We propose two new, replicable techniques to estimate which networks host active Internet users:

1. **Probing Google Public DNS Caches:**
   - We infer which prefixes have been querying for particular domains by probing Google Public DNS caches. If a prefix queries for user-facing services, we infer it likely hosts users.
   - Our technique leverages the fact that Google Public DNS accepts queries specifying an EDNS0 Client Subnet (ECS) prefix, allowing us to scan for activity over the entire IPv4 address space.

2. **Crawling Traces from Root DNS Servers:**
   - We find queries from Chromium-based browsers, as networks sourcing significant Chromium queries likely host users.
   - Chromium-based browsers use DNS probes to detect DNS interception, and these probes are designed not to be cached, providing a good approximation of Chromium usage in a network.

### Validation
We compare our techniques to each other, to APNIC network population estimates, and to server-side logs of client IP addresses from Microsoft. Our methods identify 29,973 ASes containing clients not seen by APNIC and suggest that most prefixes in at least 15% of ASes do not contain clients. The prefixes identified by our techniques as hosting web clients are responsible for 95.2% of queries to Microsoft, with 99.1% of them sending at least some queries to Microsoft.

## 2 Goals
Our primary goals are to:
- Focus on client activity to assess how Internet events and properties affect clients.
- Use replicable approaches to ensure our map is based on datasets and techniques accessible to other researchers.
- Provide fine-grained global coverage to cover as many client networks as possible, in terms of countries, ASes, and prefixes.

## 3 Measurement Methods

### 3.1 Probing DNS Caches for Client Activity
When users access websites, they issue DNS queries, populating caches in their recursive resolvers. Our approach, referred to as cache probing, involves DNS cache snooping for activity from clients around the world. We leverage Google Public DNS, which supports EDNS0 Client Subnet (ECS) and maintains separate cache entries per client prefix for domains that support ECS.

#### 3.1.1 Methodology
We issue queries to Google Public DNS, varying the ECS prefix to scan the entire IPv4 space. A cache hit for a specific ⟨prefix, domain⟩ suggests that a client in the prefix issued a query for the domain. To address the challenges of anycast routing and varying TTLs, we geo-distribute our measurements to probe caches worldwide.

#### 3.1.2 Identifying Candidate Prefixes for ECS Queries
Since ECS rarely uses prefix scopes more specific than /24, we start with the set of 15,527,909 public /24 prefixes. We use a technique to reduce probing overhead by first issuing queries directly to the authoritative resolver to learn the scope it returns for the full address space, then using these returned scopes as our query scopes to Google Public DNS.

### 3.2 Crawling Traces from Root DNS Servers
Chromium-based browsers use DNS probes to detect DNS interception. These probes are designed not to be cached, providing a good approximation of Chromium usage in a network. We crawl traces from root DNS servers to find these queries, as networks with significant Chromium queries likely host users.

## Conclusion
We conclude with a brief roadmap for future work, focusing on extending our techniques to measure relative activity levels across prefixes. Our methods provide a robust, replicable, and globally comprehensive way to identify networks hosting Internet clients, enabling more accurate and meaningful Internet analysis.
