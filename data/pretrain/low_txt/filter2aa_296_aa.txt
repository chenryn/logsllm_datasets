### Chapter 1: About System Image Administration

This chapter provides an overview of how to start up client computers using an operating system stored on a server and install software on client computers over the network.

#### NetBoot and Network Install
The NetBoot and Network Install features of Mac OS X Server offer alternatives for managing the operating system and application software needed by Macintosh clients (or even other servers). Instead of installing OS and application software from CDs on each computer, you can prepare an OS install image that is automatically installed on each computer when it starts up. Alternatively, you can have clients start up directly from an image stored on the server, eliminating the need for local disk drives.

Using NetBoot and Network Install, you can standardize the Mac OS configuration for your client computers, making it easier to update the operating system for the entire group by updating a single boot image. A boot image is a file that acts like a mountable disk or volume, containing the system software needed for client computers to start up. An install image is a special boot image that boots the client long enough to install software, after which the client can boot from its own hard drive. Both boot images and install images are types of disk images, which are files that behave like disk volumes.

You can set up multiple boot or install images to suit the needs of different groups of clients or to distribute the startup load. NetBoot can be used with Mac OS X client management services to provide a personalized work environment for each user. For more information, see the user management guide.

#### Tools for Setting Up and Managing NetBoot and Network Install
- **Network Image Utility**: Creates Mac OS X disk images. Installed in `/Applications/Server`.
- **Server Admin**: Enables and configures NetBoot service and supporting services. Installed in `/Applications/Server`.
- **PackageMaker**: Creates package files for adding additional software to disk images. Located on the Administration Tools CD in the Utilities folder.
- **Property List Editor**: Edits property lists such as `NBImageInfo.plist`. Located on the Administration Tools CD in the Utilities folder.
- **NetBoot Desktop Admin**: Modifies Mac OS 9 system disk images and accompanying disk images for applications.

For Mac OS 9 clients, you will need the `NetBoot for Mac OS 9` CD, which includes a preconfigured Mac OS 9.2.2 system disk image and the NetBoot Desktop Admin application.

#### Inside NetBoot
This section describes the implementation of NetBoot on Mac OS X Server, including protocols, files, directory structures, and configuration details.

##### Disk Images
Disk images contain the system software and applications used by client computers over the network. These read-only images typically end in `.img` or `.dmg` and can be mounted as volumes on the desktop using Disk Utility, included with Mac OS X and Mac OS 9.2.2.

- **Mac OS X Disk Images**: Created using Network Image Utility, with a Mac OS X install disc or an existing system volume as the source. See "Creating a Mac OS X Boot Image" on page 19.
- **Mac OS 9 Disk Images**: Provided on the `NetBoot for Mac OS 9` CD, which includes localized versions in several languages. See "Installing a Mac OS 9 Boot Image" on page 25. You can modify these images using NetBoot Desktop Admin. See "Modifying a Mac OS 9 Boot Image" on page 25.

##### NetBoot Share Points
NetBoot sets up share points to make images and shadow files available to clients. These share points are created in `/Library/NetBoot` on each enabled volume and are named `NetBootSPn`, where `n` is 0 for the first share point and increases by 1 for each additional share point. For example, if you store images on three separate server disks, NetBoot will set up three share points named `NetBootSP0`, `NetBootSP1`, and `NetBootSP2`.

Share points for client shadow files are also created in `/Library/NetBoot` and are named `NetBootClientsn`. You can create and enable additional share points on other server volumes using the NetBoot service General settings in Server Admin.

##### Client Information File
NetBoot gathers information about a client the first time it tries to start up from the NetBoot server and stores this information in the file `/var/db/bsdpd_clients`.

##### Shadow Files
When multiple clients read from the same boot image, NetBoot redirects any writes (such as print jobs and temporary files) to the client’s shadow files, which are separate from the system and application software. Shadow files preserve the unique identity of each client during the entire time it is running off a NetBoot image. NetBoot transparently maintains changed user data in these shadow files.
