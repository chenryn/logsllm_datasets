### Information Classification: General
### Supply-Side Vulnerability Research
- **Security Sources:**
  - The global bug-bounty market is projected to reach $5.5 billion by 2027.
  - This growth reflects the 'many eyes' theory of security, where more people scrutinizing a system can lead to better security.
  - Increasing adoption by government agencies and departments.
  - Proliferation of bug-bounty platform companies.
  - Governed by Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) processes.

### Supply-Side Vulnerability Research
- **Policy Impact on Ecosystem:**
  - Can poor policy disrupt this ecosystem?
  - How can we detect supply shocks caused by such policies?

### Good CVD in Log4Shell
- **CMU SEI CERT CC - The CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure**

### Information Classification: General
### Good CVD in Log4Shell
- **Timeline:**
  - November 24, 2021: Alibaba Cloud researcher discloses Log4Shell (l4s) to Apache Software Foundation (ASF) privately.
  - December 8, 2021: Researcher follows up with ASF with updates.
  - December 10, 2021: Patching and public announcements of l4s begin.
  - *Note: Bloomberg reports December 8, while the Wall Street Journal reports December 9.*

### Not So Good CVD
- **Incident:**
  - December 22, 2021: China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) suspends Alibaba Cloud from an information-sharing partnership for failing to disclose l4s to the MIIT prior to December 9, 2021.
  - **Reasons:**
    - According to the Wall Street Journal and an anonymous source, the suspension was due to a breach of contract in the information-sharing partnership.
    - Other reports suggest it was due to violating The Regulations on Management of Security Vulnerabilities (RMSV).

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
### Information Classification: General
- **Enforcement and Impact:**
  - The failure to disclose earlier to the MIIT was the cause of the suspension, and the RMSV was breached.
  - **The RMSV:**
    - Little reporting when it was passed or took effect, leading to significant questions about its application to multinational companies.
    - Only known enforcement is on Alibaba Cloud for l4s.
    - Most coverage concerns what happens to vulnerabilities after the MIIT gets early access.
    - Potential chilling effect on China’s research contributions:
      - Hesitation to report vulnerabilities until more legal clarity?
      - Internal policy changes regarding accepting vulnerability reports from China?
    - Clear before and after dates, with a large potential impact as China is a significant contributor to international vulnerability research.

### Other CVD Practices and Reporting Laws
- **Global Challenges:**
  - Lack of clear legal protections for researchers has caused problems globally:
    - German researcher almost charged for reporting flaws in a campaign app.
    - Missouri tried to charge a researcher for reading HTML.
- **Recent Developments:**
  - U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) declining to prosecute good-faith research.
  - European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) pushing for member governments to develop CVD policies.
  - Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Binding Operational Directive (BOD) for agencies to develop reporting systems.

### Information Classification: General
### Research Question
- **Did the RMSV cause a supply shock in China’s research contributions?**
  - If so, did that shock affect the overall supply of research contributions?
  - Are there other shocks correlated to unidentified events?

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
### Information Classification: General
### Research Question
- **Added Insights:**
  - Better understanding of external contributions to vulnerability reporting.
  - Possible to analyze the density-distribution of contributors.
- **Datasets:**
  - Acknowledgements from different Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and security update databases from Microsoft, Apple, F5, VMware, and Red Hat.
  - Looking across vendors to identify product and ecosystem trends.
  - Variety of internal practices for crediting explicitly or anonymously and organizing data (by CVE, by update batch, by vulnerability batch, etc.).
  - Open source and proprietary codebases.

### Information Classification: General
### Key Dates
- **RMSV Timeline:**
  - July 2020: Draft law containing RMSV MIIT reporting requirement first reported as known to industry and government in China.
  - July 2021: RMSV passed.
  - September 2021: RMSV takes effect.
  - December 2021: RMSV enforced publicly for the first time (maybe).
- **Confounding Events:**
  - Summer 2020: Flurry of cyber regulations in China.
  - Summer 2020: U.S. blacklisting of companies in China accelerates.
  - Summer 2021: More blacklisting.

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
### Information Classification: General
### Methods
- **Challenges:**
  - Cannot compare between datasets directly due to overlap in CVEs.
  - Apple security updates often predate listed dates for CVEs found on NVD, Tenable, etc., and are organized by software update.
  - Unclear if credits are for vulnerability discovery or demonstration of vulnerability application of a specific product.
  - Batching by month adds noise.
  - Delay between private reporting and public patching and acknowledgment is not clear.
