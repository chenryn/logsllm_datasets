### Chapter 4: Search Engine Techniques

#### PDF
PDF stands for Portable Document Format, which is the most widely used document file format online. Originally created by Adobe Systems, PDF files can be viewed and printed using Acrobat Reader, available as a free download from the Adobe website (https://get.adobe.com/reader). The PDF format has become the standard for governments, corporations, and educational institutions worldwide.

**Note:** Apache OpenOffice can be found at https://www.openoffice.org, and LibreOffice can be found at https://www.libreoffice.org.

#### Searching for Documents Using Google Operators
To find files on different cloud storage providers, you can use specific Google search operators. Here are some examples:

- **Google Docs:**
  - Query: `site:docs.google.com SEARCHTERM`
  - This will search for the specified term on the Google Docs website (docs.google.com).

- **Google Drive:**
  - Query: `site:drive.google.com SEARCHTERM`
  - This will search for documents hosted on Google Drive with public access.

- **Dropbox:**
  - Query: `site:dl.dropbox.com SEARCHTERM`

- **Amazon AWS:**
  - Query: `site:s3.amazonaws.com SEARCHTERM`

- **Microsoft OneDrive:**
  - Query: `site:onedrive.live.com SEARCHTERM`

#### File Search Engines
Some specialized search engines can query multiple file hosting sites:

- **Fagan Finder (www.faganfinder.com/filetype)**
  - An older but still functional search engine that allows you to locate different file types online. Enter your search term, select the file type, and choose the search engine to conduct your search (see Figure 4-22).

- **General-Search (www.general-search.com)**
  - Allows you to search for different file types using 11 file-hosting websites. You can select the file type and set a filter for its size (see Figure 4-23).

- **ShareDir (https://sharedir.com)**
  - Lets you specify a file type and search more than 60 file-hosting sites simultaneously. It offers a unique service allowing you to download up to 500MB daily without waiting from premium file-hosting websites. Registration for a free account is required.

**Figure 4-22.** Use the Fagan Finder file search engine to locate a variety of file types on different search engines.
**Figure 4-23.** Search for files using 11 file-hosting websites.

**Note:** You can search any file-hosting website using the Google site search operator. For example, to search for files on Mediafire.com, type: `site:mediafire.com SEARCHTERM`.

#### Custom Search Engine
We have covered various types of search engines. Now, we will discuss custom search engines, which allow you to narrow down your search for specific file types within a limited set of sites.

- **Creating a Google Custom Search Engine:**
  1. Go to www.google.com/coop/cse.
  2 - Sign in with your Google account.
  3. Click the “New search engine” button on the left side.
  4. Enter the sites you want to include in your search in the “Sites to search” section. You can include whole site URLs or individual page URLs. Select the language and give your search a name.
  5. Click the Create button to create your custom search engine (see Figure 4-24).
  6. After creating your custom search engine, Google will display a page showing the public URL and HTML code snippet for embedding it on your website. You can also access the custom search engine control panel to update settings (see Figures 4-25 and 4-26).

**Figure 4-24.** Create a custom search engine using a Google custom search.
**Figure 4-25.** Google custom search engine created successfully.
**Figure 4-26.** Viewing the public URL of your Google custom search engine.

Many users have already created their own Google custom search engines to locate files and FTP directories online. One such example is located at https://cse.google.com/cse/home?cx=014863114814409449623%3Ajc-vjhl_c5g. To use this custom search, enter your search term and specify the file type if needed (see Figure 4-27).

**Other useful Google custom search engines:**

- 250+ Video Sharing Sites (https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?key=AIzaSyB2lwQuNzUsRTH-49FA7od4dB_Xvu5DCvg&cx=001794496531944888666:ctbnemd5u7s&q=%22%22)
- File Sharing Sites Search (https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?key=AIzaSyB2lwQuNzUsRTH-49FA7od4dB_Xvu5DCvg&cx=001794496531944888666:hn5bcrszfhe&q=%22%22)
- Torrent Search (https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?key=AIzaSyB2lwQuNzUsRTH-49FA7od4dB_Xvu5DCvg&cx=001794496531944888666:ixpabzzplzy&q=%22%22)

**Note:** You can construct an advanced Google operator to search for PDF files hosted on public servers using the following Google dork: `intitle:index.of +?last modified? +?parent directory? +pdf “Search Term”`.

#### Gray Literature
Gray literature includes any material produced outside traditional commercial publishing channels. It has two main types:

- **Gray Literature:**
  - Includes books, journals, magazines, and other materials available through traditional bookstore channels or academic publications. Examples include Springer (https://rd.springer.com), which provides access to millions of scientific documents.

- **Gray Information:**
  - Cannot be easily obtained through traditional bookstore routes. It includes academic papers, preprints, proceedings, conference and discussion papers, research reports, marketing reports, technical specifications, dissertations, theses, trade publications, memoranda, government reports, translations, newsletters, market surveys, and draft versions of books and articles.

#### Data Leak Information
Data leaks, sometimes called data breaches, involve the intentional or unintentional release of confidential information to the public. They often result from black hat hacker attacks or disgruntled employees. Leaked data can include credit card information, PII, health information, financial information, usernames and passwords, trade secrets, and military information.

There is a debate on the legal status of leaked information. Some argue that leaked information is part of OSINT sources, while others believe it should not be used due to illegal acquisition. OSINT investigations should handle leaked data carefully, respecting privacy and avoiding further dissemination of sensitive information.

Leaked official documents are often distributed on specific websites, such as:
- **WikiLeaks (https://wikileaks.org)**
- **Cryptome (https://cryptome.org)**
- **Offshore Leaks (https://offshoreleaks.icij.org)**

#### Document Metadata
Digital file metadata, as discussed in Chapter 2, can contain useful information. Tools for viewing and editing metadata were also covered.

#### Image Search
Images, logos, and icons can be valuable in OSINT investigations. Major search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing provide image search functionality, but there are also specialized image search engines.

- **Basic Image Search:**
  - **Google Image Search (https://images.google.com)**
  - **Bing Image Search (www.bing.com/images)**
  - **Yahoo Images (http://images.yahoo.com)**
  - **Yandex (https://yandex.com/images)**
  - **Baidu (http://image.baidu.com)**
  - **Imgur (https://imgur.com)**
  - **Photobucket (http://photobucket.com)**
  - **Picsearch (www.picsearch.com)**
  - **Creative Commons Search (https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org)**
  - **SmugMug (https://www.smugmug.com)**

- **Advanced Image Search (Google):**
  - Criteria: image color, type (photo, face, clip art, line drawing, animated), region, site/domain, format, and usage rights.
  - URL: https://images.google.com/advanced_image_search

**Images shared across social media sites can be found in the following locations:**
