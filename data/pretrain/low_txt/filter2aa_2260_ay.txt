### Documented Long-Term Strategy and Sustainable Funding for Interoperable Communications

The organizations develop their budgets and procure communications equipment with consideration for regional interoperable communications goals, utilizing federal funds and state and local resources. State and local leadership has prioritized interoperability by securing and allocating grant monies and state resources to communications.

### Recommendations:

1. **Clarify Decision-Making Authority and Implementation Responsibilities:**
   - Formalize the decision-making authority and implementation responsibilities of governing bodies (e.g., State of Maine HSAC, communications-specific CONOPS group, Radio Network Board, TICP Working Group) through a formal charter.
   - Ensure local first responder participation in these governing bodies.

2. **Share Best Practices:**
   - Share formal agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) with other areas as best practices.

3. **Develop and Implement a Regional Strategic Plan:**
   - Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan that extends beyond the operational focus of the TICP and CONOPS.
   - Include longer-term regional goals, regulatory changes, and a 3-5 year communications funding strategy that goes beyond grants.

4. **Align Local and Statewide Strategic Planning:**
   - Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met.

5. **Joint Funding Plans:**
   - Consider developing joint funding plans at the regional level to maximize shared resources.

6. **High-Level Involvement:**
   - Involve high-level officials with political and fiscal authority to specifically focus on interoperability.

7. **Communicate Success:**
   - Communicate the success of the TICP to gain further leadership support.

### Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards

#### Portland Metropolitan Area
**Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation**

The Portland metropolitan area has successfully incorporated existing mutual aid agreements (State of Maine CONOPS) into the Portland TICP. A TICP Implementation Workshop was held to inform and train participants, but no further regional dissemination of these SOPs to additional agencies is evident. Portland is beginning to implement NIMS/ICS and encountered minor command and control problems during an exercise (e.g., the Communications Unit Leader announcement was not included in the TICP, ICS Form 205 was not updated).

**Recommendations:**
- Continue distributing regional interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP) to all participating agencies and dispatch centers.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (including communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Advanced Implementation**

The Portland area regularly uses shared channels and systems in day-to-day operations. During the exercise, participants effectively established interoperable communications and demonstrated proficiency with available equipment. For example, South Portland used Maine CONOPS channels for incident communications, while Portland agencies used their 800 MHz system. The area should be commended for establishing a communications governance agreement among local agencies and the U.S. Coast Guard.

**Recommendation:**
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

**Technology Overview:**
- The State of Maine uses the Maine State Communication Network Program, a VHF high band system for state-level public safety agencies.
- The State of Maine Department of Transportation uses a VHF low band system.
- Local and county radio systems are independently managed and operated.
- Specific shared interoperable communications channels are described by the Maine CONOPS.
- The City of Portland supports 800 MHz ICALL and ITAC1 as standard National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee channels, but coverage is limited to the I-95 corridor.
- Gateways consisting of audio bridges, console patches, and crossband repeaters are used by various agencies.
- The City of Portland supports local agencies using an 800 MHz Motorola SMARTNETâ„¢ I System and has a halo of VHF stations that link into its 800 MHz system, allowing city practitioners to communicate with surrounding communities on the VHF band.

### Jackson (Mississippi)
**Governance: Intermediate Implementation**

The Mississippi Wireless Communications Commission established the Mississippi Capitol Region (MCR) Committee to develop the TICP and is beginning to prioritize interoperability. While a positive step, the mission and responsibilities of the committee need clearer definition. The decision-making group does not meet regularly, and there are no specific agreements for interoperability. The area is working on a strategic plan, which will need to be distributed to regional public safety agencies.

**Recommendations:**
- Establish regularly scheduled MCRC meetings and expand membership to include local, state, and federal representation.
- Document and implement agreements (e.g., MOUs) among all participating agencies to support regional interoperability.
- Encourage the development of a strategic plan beyond the TICP, aligning local and state strategic planning efforts.
- Initiate long-term (3-5 years) communications interoperability planning and sustainable funding.
- Continue involving government leadership in communications interoperability issues.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Intermediate Implementation**

The MCR developed new interoperable communications SOPs for the TICP, disseminated at the TICP Workshop. The area reports NIMS/ICS compliance but did not fully demonstrate proficiency during the exercise.

**Recommendations:**
- Document and implement regional communications interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP) through training and exercises.
- Ensure regional SOPs align with statewide planning efforts.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Intermediate Implementation**

Jackson officials report that first responders have been largely successful in implementing interoperability solutions. However, during the TICP exercise, some agencies within Madison and Rankin counties were unable to communicate effectively due to differences in radio architecture.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional interoperability resources.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

**Technology Overview:**
- Mississippi has a VHF low band radio system with interoperable/mutual aid channels, including VHF VTAC and UHF UTAC in Jackson.
- Four shared systems can be used in the greater Jackson area, including three 800 MHz systems and one VHF high band radio system.
- There are more than 11 gateways or methods by which talk groups and/or channels can be patched.

### Yellowstone County (Montana)
**Governance: Early Implementation**

While the State of Montana is active in interoperability efforts, the governance structure for Yellowstone County is unclear. The TICP development and validation exercise revealed a poorly defined governance structure, with only law enforcement agencies involved. Individual agencies currently develop and maintain their own budgets and procure equipment based on agency-specific needs.

**Recommendations:**
- Involve all first responders, public support, state, federal, and tribal agencies in the decision-making group and define roles and responsibilities.
- Document and formalize agreements (e.g., MOUs) among all participating agencies.
- Broaden agreements to include state, federal, and tribal agencies.
- Develop and implement a strategic plan (beyond the TICP), with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance.
- Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts.
- Incorporate a regional interoperability funding strategy into the strategic plan.
- Continue to broaden and champion a governance structure that supports regional interoperability.
- Consider the direct involvement of a high-level official with political and fiscal authority to focus on interoperability.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Intermediate Implementation**

The Yellowstone TICP was primarily developed by the law enforcement community, and SOPs have not been actively disseminated. The area has implemented NIMS/ICS for over a year but did not successfully incorporate the communications unit and COML position during the validation exercise.

**Recommendations:**
- Expand multidiscipline participation in the development of regional interoperability SOPs.
- Evolve the TICP based on expanded participation and disseminate it appropriately.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Intermediate Implementation**

Yellowstone officials use shared systems and channels daily. Law enforcement agencies have a well-established color-coded shared channel plan, but the exercise identified areas needing improvement for interoperability within other agencies.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional interoperability resources.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

**Technology Overview:**
- Funding from DHS grants to the Montana metropolitan area is coordinated through Montana Disaster and Emergency Services (MDES).
- Yellowstone County has two radio caches, 800 MHz and VHF mutual aid frequencies, and two fixed gateways.
- There is an 800 MHz analog trunked shared system (City of Billings system) that supports the entire area.

### Concord (New Hampshire)
**Governance: Established Implementation**

New Hampshire has a Joint Committee for first responders with oversight for interoperability. For the TICP, Concord established a working group of state officials and multidiscipline agencies. An interoperability MOU is in place for all local agencies, but there is no single strategic planning document. New Hampshire has developed a long-term infrastructure strategy, but it is unclear if a long-term funding strategy is in place.

**Recommendations:**
- Involve federal and public support organizations in the decision-making group and document roles and responsibilities.
- Develop and review agreements (e.g., MOUs) every 3-5 years and after significant events or changes.
