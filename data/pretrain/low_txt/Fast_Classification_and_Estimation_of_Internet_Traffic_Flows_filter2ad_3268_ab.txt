### 4.2 Traffic Distribution: Elephants and Mice

In Figures 3 and 4, we analyze the traffic carried by elephant and mouse flows based on the frequency of packet occurrence and the volume of traffic per FlowID. These metrics serve as the basis for flow probability calculations. Our analysis reveals that 99% of FlowIDs carry 70% of the network traffic, while the remaining 1% (elephant flows) carry 30% of the traffic. This distribution remains consistent regardless of whether we use frequency or volume as the basis for probability calculation.

### 4.3 Entropy Distribution: Elephants and Mice

Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the temporal variation in the entropy ratio between elephant and mouse flows. Only the FlowIDs classified as mice are considered. During the first 500 milliseconds of input traffic, there is a noticeable dip in the entropy of elephant flows. This is attributed to the presence of bursty elephant flows, which temporarily increase the probability of the set of elephants. As the experiment progresses, the entropy of mouse flows increases, while the entropy of elephant flows decreases. Since the entropy of the typical set decreases with the number of FlowIDs, the probability and proportion of FlowIDs classified as elephants increases.

### Estimating the Density Function of the Distribution

In Figures 7 and 8, we compare the probability density function (pdf) of the elephants present in the original traffic stream with the pdf of elephants identified using our approach based on the Parzen window technique. The observed trends are similar in both cases.

- **X-axis:** f(x)
- **Y-axis:** x

This unique trend in entropy variation ensures a conservative yet accurate flow classification for high traffic volumes.

### 5 Conclusions

In this paper, we have focused on classifying and estimating the properties of elephant and mouse flows based on the Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP) from Information Theory. Although significant attention has been given to identifying high and low traffic volumes, our approach using typical sequences simplifies the problem and provides a standard yardstick for defining long-lived flows. We have evaluated our algorithm against the approach in [8] and observed that our method effectively identifies bursty elephant flows without overestimating their occurrence. Future work will involve testing our observations on NLANR traces of more than one hour duration to assess the performance of our classification and estimation algorithms under varying traffic conditions.
