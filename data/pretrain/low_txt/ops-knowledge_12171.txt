To install and configure Active Directory on Windows Server 2016, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure that your server has Windows Server 2016 installed and can connect to the internet or an internal DNS server.

2. Open the "Add Roles and Features" wizard via the "Add Roles and Features" option in Server Manager.

3. Click "Next" until you reach the "Installation Type" page. Choose "Role-based or feature-based installation" and click "Next".

4. Select "Select a server from the server pool", then click "Next".

5. Choose the "Active Directory Domain Services" role. If a prompt appears, select "Add Features". Then, click "Next" and "Install" to begin the installation process.

6. Once the installation is complete, initiate the "Promote this server to a domain controller" wizard. You can do this either through the Server Manager tool or by entering "dcpromo" at the Windows PowerShell command line interface.

7. On the "Deployment Configuration" page, choose "Add a new forest" and specify a domain name (e.g., mycompany.com).

8. Set a password for the Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) and proceed to the next step.

9. In "DNS Options", select "I will use DNS..." and input the domain name in "NetBIOS name".

10. In "Additional Domain Controller Options", pick the installation options that best suit your needs.

11. Review your selections on the "Review Options" page, then click "Next" to start the Active Directory installation.

12. After the installation is complete, the server will automatically restart as it now functions as a domain controller. You can manage and configure your domains and other Active Directory objects using the "Active Directory Users and Computers" console in the Server Manager tool or through tools like Windows PowerShell.

*Note: It's recommended to have a solid understanding of Active Directory and domain controller concepts and operations before proceeding with the installation.*
