### 4. Affected Domains

We manually inspected the vulnerable domains from the Alexa Top 1 Million list. Table 3 summarizes the types of organizations affected. The 'Business' category is broad and includes a diverse set of companies, ranging from small to large enterprises. Notably, this category includes several global car manufacturers. Additionally, we identified 56 vulnerable government sites in North America, Europe, and Asia, including both national and regional entities. The affected educational domains have a similar geographical distribution and include several reputable universities. In the healthcare sector, we found multiple hospitals and the domain of a national medical association. Remarkably, nine of the vulnerable domains belong to banks in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, ranging from small private banking firms to one of the largest banks in the world. In summary, the vulnerability affects high-profile businesses, governments, and organizations.

### 5. Exploitation

To determine whether non-secure updates were exploited in the wild, we checked for overlap between the vulnerable domains and those blacklisted by StopBadware [5] and the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) [2] in 2015. The former lists 1,016,961 unique fully qualified domain names (FQDNs), while the latter lists 1,967,995. For the Alexa Top 1 Million and the random sample, we found 15 and 45 blacklisted FQDNs related to vulnerable second-level domains, respectively. After manual inspection, we did not find compelling evidence that these domains were actually affected by malicious dynamic updates. The sites appeared legitimate and may represent false positives or compromised resources.

We also searched DNSDB for FQDNs of vulnerable domains associated with common words used in phishing attacks, such as PayPal, Apple, Taobao, and Amazon. We identified some suspicious FQDNs, such as `shopping.*.com.*.*.edu` or `*.alibaba.com.*.ru`. However, these sites were either offline or required additional authentication to access. Some appeared to be legitimate proxy services, such as university resources requiring authorized access and redirecting users to external websites.

### 5.4 Affected DNS Server Software

To identify the software running on non-secure authoritative name servers, we used the FPDNS tool [6] to scan three groups of servers on April 24, 2016: i) all 510,850 name servers from the random sample, ii) the 188 vulnerable servers from the random sample, and iii) the 560 vulnerable servers from the Alexa Top 1 Million sample. Fingerprinting was successful for 45% (232,317), 38% (72), and 41% (227) of each respective group. We do not distinguish between different software versions, as there are no major changes in the implementation of secure DNS dynamic updates (cf. Section 2.3).

Figure 3 illustrates the results of the DNS software fingerprinting. The majority of servers authoritative for the total random sample run BIND (37%). Microsoft Windows DNS constitutes only 0.5% of this group, but for the vulnerable groups, it is the dominant package at 19% and 27%. The second and third largest groups of vulnerable server types are NLnetLabs NSD and ISC BIND. Since the standard package of NLnetLabs NSD does not include functionality for dynamic updates, we suspect that it might be added through an external, RFC-compliant plugin (see Section 2.3).

### 5.5 Survival Analysis

The final part of our study aimed to measure the survival times of the added records to determine if self-correcting mechanisms were in place. We initiated the measurement on April 16, 2016, by sending update requests to add an extra A RR (see Section 4.2) to previously confirmed instances of vulnerable domains. We observed 3,920 successfully added A records corresponding to 1,870 domain names for the 1% sample and 1,691 A RRs associated with 584 domains for the Alexa Top 1 Million.

Over a 10-day period, we performed DNS lookups every 4 hours, sending A RR requests to each IP address of the servers associated with vulnerable domains. We conducted survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier estimator [22].

The results indicate a very low removal rate of the added records (cf. Figure 4). While we do not know why some records were removed, one plausible explanation is that zone transfers from the primary master may have overwritten the added entries. At the end of our experiment, records were still present in approximately 94.3% (3,696) of the random sample and 95.9% (1,622) of the Alexa Top 1 Million domains. Interestingly, the Alexa Top 1 Million domains did not show a higher removal rate compared to the random sample; in fact, they performed slightly worse. Given that we received no contact from the operators of the non-secure servers, it appears that no other security mechanisms are in place to discover and mitigate the threat.

### 6. Conclusions

This study presents the first measurement of the vulnerability of non-secure DNS dynamic updates, which enables an attack referred to as zone poisoning. We measured prevalence rates for a random sample of 2.9 million domains (0.065%) and for the Alexa Top 1 Million domains (0.062%). Our findings indicate that this vulnerability poses a serious security flaw that warrants more attention from domain owners and DNS service operators.

Certain limitations must be considered. First, our measurements provide a conservative lower bound for the magnitude of the problem. Servers relying on address match lists to secure dynamic updates are counted as 'secure' in our measurement, but they remain vulnerable to IP spoofing. The attack requires only a single packet, making it possible for attackers to guess addresses on the match list.

Our datasets also have inherent limitations. For example, DNSDB has extensive but not complete coverage of the domain name space and contains poisoned or obsolete entries, so many servers did not respond to our dynamic updates. Responsibility is distributed and complex, and the identification of certain providers and software packages as being associated with vulnerable domains should not be interpreted as assigning blame.

The next step is to expand our measurements and notify all affected parties to improve the security of the DNS ecosystem, a critical service for many applications.
