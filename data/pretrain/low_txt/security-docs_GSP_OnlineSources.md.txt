# Online Access to Source Code

Since its launch in 2003, the Government Security Program (GSP) has provided governments and international organizations with the ability to access and inspect the source code for a variety of Microsoft products. The Online Source offering enhances security assurance by enabling read-only access to product source code through the Code Center Premium (CCP), a secure web portal. Available products include **Windows**, **Office**, **SharePoint**, **Exchange**, and **SQL Server**.

## Code Center Premium

The Online Source offering and CCP site allow GSP participants to:

- Evaluate individual system component functions.
- Assess component interactions.
- Examine security and reliability capabilities.

Agencies can use CCP's comprehensive search functionality to navigate and review source code trees. To maximize the value of in-person visits, agencies are typically required to review the source code remotely via CCP before visiting a Transparency Center.

## Example Use Cases for Online Source

- **Understanding Specific Features:** Gain insights into how specific features are implemented.
- **Reviewing Microsoft Coding Practices:** Examine the coding standards and practices used by Microsoft.
- **Identifying and Validating Vulnerabilities:** Search for and validate potential security vulnerabilities.
