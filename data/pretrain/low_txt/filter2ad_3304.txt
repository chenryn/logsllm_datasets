**Identity-Based Encryption: From Algorithm to Enterprise Deployment**

### Abstract
Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) is an asymmetric encryption system that allows identifiers such as email addresses, server names, or phone numbers to be used as public keys. Originally proposed by Adi Shamir in 1984, the first practical IBE algorithm was introduced in 2001. Since then, IBE has not only generated significant academic interest but has also been widely adopted in industry, with hundreds of thousands of users and ongoing standardization efforts by the IEEE.

In this talk, we will provide an overview of the current state of IBE and reflect on the factors that have contributed to its rapid success. Unlike many traditional encryption protocols, IBE represents a new cryptographic paradigm that cannot be built from existing encryption algorithms. As a novel primitive, IBE directly addresses some of the challenges associated with classic public key systems. Specifically, it enables the use of short-lived public keys, eliminates the overhead of certificate management, and facilitates centralized key management. Consequently, IBE systems require less state and are more lightweight and scalable compared to traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems.

We will discuss the IBE algorithms and standardization activities, describe a secure email system based on IBE, and examine a live enterprise deployment of IBE to highlight its advantages and differences from traditional PKI.
