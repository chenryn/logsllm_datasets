**Current Behavior:**
When using the `providers` array in a module, the services are registered at the application level. This is a common approach to provide application-wide services, as demonstrated in various examples.

However, if a lazy-loaded module imports other modules and their providers, these imported providers will override the root-level providers due to the creation of a new root scope for the lazy-loaded module. As a result, duplicate instances of the services will be created. 

Therefore, when using lazy-loaded modules, it is recommended to avoid using `providers` in feature modules, as this can lead to duplicated service instances. Instead, all application-level providers should be defined in the `AppModule`.

There are currently no known use cases where feature module providers can be safely used without causing duplication.

**Expected Behavior:**
The architecture should be improved to create a valid use case for feature module providers, or this feature should be deprecated. The documentation should clearly outline how to define application-level providers exclusively in the `AppModule`, and not in feature modules.
