# PLAS 2018 - ACM SIGSAC Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security

**Authors:** Mário S. Alvim and Stéphanie Delaune

## Abstract
The 13th ACM SIGSAC Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security (PLAS 2018) is co-located with the 25th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2018). Over its more than ten-year history, PLAS has provided a unique forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas about programming language and program analysis techniques aimed at improving the security of software systems. The workshop aims to explore and evaluate new and speculative ideas, practical evaluations of known and new techniques, and discussions on emerging threats and significant problems in the field.

## CCS Concepts
- **Security and Privacy**: Software and Application Security

## Keywords
- Programming languages
- Security

## 1. Introduction
PLAS provides a platform for exploring and evaluating the use of programming languages and program analysis techniques to enhance the security of software systems. We strongly encourage submissions that propose new, speculative ideas, evaluate new or existing techniques in practical settings, and discuss emerging threats and important problems. Position papers that are radical, forward-looking, and likely to spark insightful discussions influencing future research at the intersection of programming languages and security are particularly welcome.

## 2. Scope
The scope of PLAS includes, but is not limited to:
- Compiler-based security mechanisms (e.g., security type systems)
- Runtime-based security mechanisms (e.g., inline reference monitors)
- Program analysis techniques for discovering security vulnerabilities
- Automated introduction and/or verification of security enforcement mechanisms
- Language-based verification of security properties in software
- Specifying and enforcing security policies for information flow and access control
- Model-driven approaches to security
- Security concerns for web programming languages
- Language design for security in new domains such as cloud computing and IoT
- Applications, case studies, and implementations of these techniques, including verification of cryptographic protocols

## 3. Workshop Format
This year, PLAS received high-quality submissions, reflecting the continued vitality of the community working at the intersection of programming languages and security. PLAS 2018 welcomed both long research papers and short papers presenting preliminary or exploratory work to generate lively discussions at the workshop. The workshop attracted 10 submissions, including 6 short papers, from 8 countries (Belgium, Estonia, France, Israel, Japan, Sweden, United Kingdom, USA), with authors from both academia and industry.

PLAS 2018 is honored to feature two excellent invited talks:
- **Network Verification: Successes, Challenges, and Opportunities** by Nate Foster (Cornell University, USA)
- **Formal Verification of Differential Privacy** by Marco Gaboardi (University at Buffalo, SUNY, USA)

## 5. Workshop Organizers
- **Mário S. Alvim (PC co-chair)**: Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at UFMG (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais), Brazil. His research focuses on the foundations of computer security, contributing to the establishment of a rigorous science of security. He has developed a compositional approach for modeling systems and quantifying their information-flow properties, with a particular interest in game-theoretic approaches to quantification of information flow.
- **Stéphanie Delaune (PC co-chair)**: Research Scientist at CNRS since 2007. She spent about 10 years at ENS Cachan before joining the EMSEC (Embedded System & Security) team at IRISA (Rennes, France). Her research focuses on the formal analysis and design of security protocols, using techniques from automated reasoning, rewriting, model-checking, and concurrency theory. In February 2017, she obtained an ERC Starting Grant to develop foundations and practical tools for analyzing modern security protocols, with the aim of securing the next generation of nomadic contactless devices.
