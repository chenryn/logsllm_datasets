### Reasoning and Base Cases

The reasoning is illustrated in Figure 9. For the base cases, we observe that for any \( x \), \( T(x, 0) = 1 \) (a height bound of 0 does not allow the original node to disseminate to any other node) and \( T(0, x) = 1 \) (with 0 rounds, no dissemination occurs).

### Maximum Number of Reachable Nodes

Next, we consider the maximum number of nodes reachable from a max-depth leaf vertex \( u \) within \( t \) rounds. This argument is depicted in Figure 8, which shows the nodes between \( u \) and the root \( r \). The node \( u_i \) is \( i \) levels above \( u \) and can be reached no earlier than at round \( i \). Therefore, \( u_i \) has \( t - i \) rounds remaining to disseminate into its subtree. Since \( u \) is a node at the maximum depth in the tree, the subtree rooted at \( u_i \) has a height bound of \( i \). Consequently, the maximum number of nodes reached from \( u_i \) is \( T(t - i, i) \).

A bound on the total number of nodes reachable from \( u \) in \( t \) rounds is given by \( F(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{t} T(t - i, i) \). Using the recurrence relation \( T(t, h) = T(t-1, h) + T(t-1, h-1) \), we can expand \( F(t) \) as follows:

\[
F(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{t} T(t - i, i)
\]

\[
= T(t, 0) + \sum_{i=1}^{t} T(t - i, i) + T(0, t)
\]

\[
= 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{t} [T(t - i - 1, i) + T(t - i - 1, i - 1)] + 1
\]

\[
= T(t - 1, 0) + \sum_{i=1}^{t-1} T(t - 1 - i, i) + 1
\]

\[
= F(t - 1) + F(t - 2) + 1
\]

By substituting \( F'(t) = F(t) + 1 \), we see that \( F'(t) = F'(t - 1) + F'(t - 2) \), which yields a Fibonacci series. From the base cases \( F(0) = 1 \) and \( F(1) = 2 \), we can show that \( F(t) = \text{Fib}(t + 3) - 1 \), where \(\text{Fib}(x)\) is the \( x \)-th number in the standard Fibonacci series. Using Binet's formula, \(\text{Fib}(x) \leq \frac{\phi^x}{\sqrt{5}}\), we derive the bounds.

### Summary and Conclusion

Table I summarizes the results presented in this paper. The new protocols avoid the high computation overhead of digital signatures and the high communication overhead of one-time signatures and multi-receiver MACs, as well as the time synchronization required by TESLA. In terms of round complexity and communication congestion, our protocols provide points in the design space that are not achievable by previously published protocols. Specifically, for the linear topology, the hash tree scheme achieves the fastest possible round complexity \( n \) with only \( O(\log n) \) congestion; the hash chain scheme achieves constant congestion with only \( 2n \) round complexity. For the fully connected topology, the hash tree scheme requires at most \( 2\lfloor \log n \rfloor + 1 \) round complexity with only \( O(\log n) \) congestion. We also show that this is the fastest possible round complexity achievable for schemes with polylogarithmic congestion, providing an existence proof that the \( 2 \log n \) bound is asymptotically tight on the coefficient of \( \log n \) for the full-duplex communication model. Our optimizations do not significantly increase the per-round communication cost.

### Contributions

The main contributions of this paper include showing previously uninvestigated round complexity bounds for symmetric-key-based broadcast authentication in fully connected and tree topologies. We establish a tight round complexity bound of \( 2 \log n \) rounds for broadcast authentication schemes with polylogarithmic congestion in any topology and another round complexity lower bound of \( 2.44 \log n - 2.33 \) rounds for trees. These lower bounds highlight the fundamental round complexity limitations of broadcast authentication protocols and can inform the design constraints of new authentication protocols in networks. The new bounds also significantly extend the relevance of the result on multicast message authentication by Boneh, Durfee, and Franklin [18]. The previous result applied only to static authentication codes and did not address protocols involving multiple interactions between receivers, which are the primary methods of multicast message authentication in practice. In our proofs of round complexity lower bounds, we greatly improve the relevance of this result by showing how it can be extended to apply to general authentication protocols by considering round complexity. This significantly expands the existing level of understanding about the fundamental limits in signature-free multicast authentication.
