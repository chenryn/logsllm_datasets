### Detection of Malicious Domains

Several systems have been developed to detect malicious domains using passive DNS monitoring and machine learning [18], [19], [24]. These systems enable network operators to compile DNS blacklists of malicious and suspicious domains, thereby detecting and preventing malicious activity on the network. This has prompted researchers to investigate the effectiveness of such blacklists.

Metcalf et al. [46] conducted a comparative study of 86 different internet blacklists, covering various categories and types, over a period of 30 months. Unfortunately, the inventory of these blacklists was partially anonymized, and some were collected for as little as three months, making direct comparisons challenging. Their findings indicated that there is minimal overlap between lists for fully qualified domain names or IP addresses, and when overlap exists, no single list consistently outperforms the others.

Kührer et al. [39] evaluated the effectiveness of 19 malware blacklists collected over two years by classifying the entries (i.e., non-existent, parked, or sinkholed), measuring completeness, and testing reaction times. When compared against a dataset of 300,000 samples, they found that the union of all blacklists contained 70% of domains detected per family. Additionally, 58% of the domains appeared in their passive DNS an average of 334 days before being listed on a blacklist. Our study, conducted over a much longer observation period and with nearly 100 times more malware, shows similar results.

Rajab et al. [63] proposed a content-agnostic malware protection system based on binary and IP/DNS reputation to address the limitations of both blacklists and whitelists. Other works have also leveraged network-related reputation data for malware detection [34], [62].

### Conclusion

After carefully filtering 26.8 million network traces obtained from dynamic malware execution, we made several observations about the characteristics and temporal network properties of malware domains. First, dynamic analysis traces should be meticulously curated due to the high noise levels. We provide a rigorous methodology for analysts to remove potential noise from such traces. Next, potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) are not only increasing but also utilizing seemingly stable IP infrastructure. In fact, we found that several hundred thousand PUP samples used the same network infrastructure over an entire year. Finally, our analysis indicates that malware adds marginal detection benefits when building early warning systems based on its network communication. We discovered that 302,953 malware domains were active at least two weeks—sometimes many months—before the corresponding malware samples were dynamically analyzed. This suggests that malware domain blacklists have limited detection value, as malware tends to rapidly churn through domain names, resulting in a high rate of domain-level polymorphism.
