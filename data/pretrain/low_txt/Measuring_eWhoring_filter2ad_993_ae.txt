## 8. Discussion and Conclusion
This paper presents our measurements related to eWhoring, using data collected from underground forums. These forums serve as gateways for curious users seeking easy money-making methods. Packs, which consist of images and videos gathered from third-party sites, often include adult and pornographic content, and sometimes even child abuse material. Our proposed methodology helps in understanding which services or sites are being abused by fraudsters. For example, it can be used by social networks to protect their users against identity theft or by the adult industry to enforce copyright.

Many of the sites where these packs are distributed have terms of service that prohibit content infringing on others' copyrights or containing nudity. We found that many links were removed due to violations of these terms. As actors rely on these third-party sites for sharing material, a potential intervention approach is for image-sharing and cloud storage sites to rigorously enforce their terms of service. To this end, blacklists with hashes of known images used for eWhoring, such as those found in packs, could be created and shared among stakeholders.

Actors post screenshots showing proof of earnings on the forums, either to advertise their services or to brag about their capabilities. We analyzed 1,800 such images to estimate the earnings made through eWhoring. Our analysis shows that some actors report making hundreds of US dollars in just a few days. The total earnings reported by 661 actors amount to US$511,000. Amazon and PayPal are the most commonly used platforms for obtaining payment, with the average transaction amount being around US$40.

Payment platforms may play a role in detecting and shutting down accounts used to receive payments for eWhoring. Additionally, regulating the exchange of non-fiat currencies, such as selling gift cards for Bitcoin, may make it more difficult for criminals to monetize their activities [1].

Legitimate participants in the adult entertainment industry potentially suffer multiple harms from eWhoring. First, their images may be stolen and used for fraud. Second, they may lose revenue that would otherwise go to fraudsters. When designing interventions, it is crucial to ensure that they do not negatively impact law-abiding individuals involved in online sex work.

Our measurements confirm that eWhoring is a low-value but high-volume fraud. The legality of these activities is questionable, and the specific crimes involved vary by jurisdiction. Until recently, eWhoring had not attracted much attention from law enforcement or academia, possibly because victims may not be aware of or do not report the scam. However, this activity poses various social and ethical concerns for both offenders and victims. We observed that users initially interested in gaming, coding, or hacking turned into experienced eWhoring actors. These users, likely young people based on our observations, engage in online sexual conversations, are exposed to pornography, and risk downloading, storing, and redistributing illegal material. While their customers believe they are paying for encounters with attractive women, they are actually engaging in sexual activities with fraudsters, who may be underage.

## Appendix: Ethical Issues
This research involved a substantial number of ethical issues. To address them, we used the guiding principles contained in The Menlo Report: Ethical Principles Guiding Information and Communication Technology Research [11] and the British Society of Criminology’s Statement of Ethics [6]. We also complied with the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre’s data sharing agreements, which set out how the data may be used and handled. This design was approved by the ethics committee of the Department of Computer Science and Technology of the University of Cambridge (#473). We next describe in detail our approach with respect to these frameworks.

### P1 Respect for Persons
**Stakeholder Identification:** The dataset we used to conduct this research contains the digital identifiers used by actors involved in eWhoring forums, as well as their communications and other relationships that can be derived from such identification. Even if these identifiers are merely nicknames, this could imply a risk to those actors. We took precautions to avoid exposing the identity of these research subjects. In accordance with the British Society of Criminology’s Statement of Ethics, our research analyzes only collective behavior, rather than individuals. We were also careful with our presentation of results to reduce the likelihood they could be linked back to the forum accounts, potentially leaking their identity. The dataset we were provided with was collected from public sources and already contained the identifiers. The identifiers are hard to fully remove as (variations on) the identifiers are used in the text of posts. Hence, removing the identifiers would make the analysis more difficult but not reduce risk to forum users as we do not publish anything that can be linked to those identifiers.

**Informed Consent:** Our analysis involves subjects from whom it is impossible to obtain informed consent, as this did not take place at the time the dataset was created. This, however, fits the case discussed in The Menlo Report in which gathering informed consent is impracticable:
"Because of the difficulty in identifying all individuals from whom consent should be sought or in practicably obtaining consent, researchers or REBs may frequently conclude that seeking a waiver of informed consent or waiver of documentation of informed consent are the only options" [11].
We therefore resorted to a waiver of informed consent issued by our REB. This approach also complies with the British Society of Criminology’s Statement of Ethics [6], as the dataset is collected from online communities where the data are publicly available, and, as mentioned above, is used to analyze collective rather than individual behavior.

### P2 Beneficence
**Identification of Potential Benefits and Harms:** Our work involves societal benefits as it attempts to provide an improved understanding of a phenomenon with potential legal implications and, by extension, an advancement of existing knowledge of the cybercrime ecosystem. Furthermore, our analysis pipeline could find application in other cybercrime areas, thus fostering and facilitating additional research in the field. However, conducting this research involves the analysis of images containing sexual or nude content. The viewing of such images poses a risk to the well-being of researchers. Additionally, since these images come from unknown parties engaged in cybercrime, there is a risk that there may be indecent images of children included within the images that we would collect. Possession of such images is a strict liability offense in the jurisdictions where this research was conducted. Hence, the possession of such images presents a legal risk.

**Balancing Risks and Benefits:** Our assessment of risks and benefits concluded that there is a reasonable balance that justifies this work if a number of design precautions were implemented to mitigate or minimize risks. We detail them next.

**Mitigation of Realised Harms:** Our analysis pipeline (Section 4) was purposely designed to address the risks mentioned above, thus limiting the ethical and legal concerns. Classification and analysis of sensitive material (particularly images) is done semi-automatically, using established methods and tools to avoid researchers’ exposure to potentially perturbing material.

Our research design was based on the assumption that finding indecent images of children was very unlikely. Nonetheless, we discussed this research with the IWF in advance to reduce the likelihood of prosecution, and guidelines were established in the event that images were classified as child exploitation material, namely immediately reporting the location of the images to the IWF and deleting them from our servers. These guidelines were established as a precaution with the assistance of the REB. We originally thought it unlikely that the dataset would contain child abuse material, and were surprised when matches were identified. We reiterate that these images were never viewed by any of the researchers, and our guidelines were complied with. Given our experience, future research in this area should assume a greater likelihood of finding indecent images of children and consider whether our design is adequate.

### P3 Justice
Our study complies with the principles of fairness and equity in the selection of research subjects. We do not arbitrarily target or exclude users based on any attribute other than an active participation in eWhoring forums. We do not know the representativeness of that user base in terms of religion, political affiliation, sexual orientation, health, age, technical competency, national origin, race, or socioeconomic status, as suggested in the Menlo Report [11].

### P4 Respect for Law and Public Interest
**Compliance:** Our prior belief was that the risk of obtaining indecent images of children was very low, as it is against the rules of the forums we were looking at, and we expected moderators would remove any such content. However, as noted above, we took precautions against this eventuality and, as discussed in Section 4.3, we were surprised to find that a small proportion of the images were indecent images of children. Those were reported using appropriate channels (the INHOPE hotline operator for the jurisdiction in which the work was conducted).

**Transparency and Accountability:** In our reporting of this research, we attempted to follow the principles of transparency and accountability. This encompasses our data sources, research methodology, and tools used (including known or identified limitations), and the main results obtained. Our tools, data, and acquired know-how remain at the disposal of the community for any enquiry that requires further clarifications. No data or insights that could help identify users will be shared.
