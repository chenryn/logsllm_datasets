# Executive Summary

- **Data in the Air:**
  - Captured by antennas
  - Antennas are not protected
  - Not all antenna operators (referred to as "Antenna Farmers") are intelligence agents

- **Data Transmission:**
  - Data is transmitted from antennas to a secure Vault
  - Data is deposited on a classified network
  - Once data enters the Vault, it cannot be retrieved or retransmitted back out

- **Data Packaging and Distribution:**
  - Data is packaged and sent from the Vault to the designated recipient ("The Man")
  - The recipient requires limited access to the data
  - Data becomes classified once it is integrated with other packets on the network

# What Goes Where?

- **Antenna Farm:**
  - Administered by engineers
  - Not all engineers have a "need-to-know" for each aspect of the project
  - Antennas are located in unsecured areas
  - Data collected is initially unclassified

- **Collector (Push) System:**
  - Requires integrity
  - The system itself is unclassified
  - Must ensure that it has not been tampered with
  - Access to the console requires physical entry into the Vault

- **Data Scrubber:**
  - Ensures data integrity
  - Acts as a gateway to the classified networks
  - Passes acceptable packets through a firewall
  - Logs and drops unacceptable packets

---

# Problem Statement

- **Real-Time Data Collection:**
  - Data must be collected in near real-time
  - No sensitive data should taint the unclassified portions of the system
  - Antennas, push/packaging systems, and internal scrub boxes are all unclassified
  - Once combined with downstream data, the collected data becomes sensitive

- **Data Flow Control:**
  - Only the collected data is allowed to enter the government network
  - Strict prohibition against data driftback
  - Extensive testing and documentation are required before the system can go live

---

# Solution

- **Access Control:**
  - Limit access to the highest level of data
  - Keep uncleared and DoD personnel out of the Vault
  - Ensure data flows in one direction only

- **Data Integrity:**
  - Prevent data tainting on UNCLASSIFIED systems
  - Use a one-way fiber link between antennas/collect system and packager
  - Implement an Inline_Snort system between the push system and the classified network

- **System Integrity:**
  - Accept data only from a specific MAC address on one interface
  - Limit the number of accounts on the system
  - Highly regulate and document all configuration changes

- **Packet Scrubber:**
  - No IP stack in the operating kernel
  - Severely limit what passes through the scrubber
  - Use firewall rules to further filter data traveling to the far-end

# Data Flow Mitigations

- **Signal Interception:**
  - Signals of interest are intercepted by antennas
  - Data is passed to a bespoke data packaging application via one-way fiber transmission
  - Ethernet to Fiber transceivers are used with only the receive side connected
  - Beyond this point, Intel clearances and physical access to the Vault are required

- **Data Packaging:**
  - Custom UDP packets are crafted and passed along
  - A numeric code is inserted into an unused header segment
  - Data is checked for corruption and packaged for transport
  - Packets are handed off to the external interface of the Inline_Snort system via a crossover Ethernet cable

---

# Data Flow (Continued)

- **Packet Scrubbing:**
  - The packet scrubber decides whether to pass data onwards
  - It checks the header for a numeric trigger
  - If the trigger is present, the data is passed out the other interface
  - If the trigger is not present, the packet is logged and dropped

- **Firewall:**
  - Only passes data from the classified scrubber interface to the government analysis station at the far end
  - MAC filtering is used to reduce spoofing issues
  - Ruleset only allows data from the Scrubber MAC to the far-end analysis console
  - All other data is logged and dropped by the firewall

---

# Testing & Documentation

- **Approval Process:**
  - Concept of Operations (ConOps) plan required for approval
  - Test Plan submission after ConOps approval
  - Government-attended test run of the system without far-end connectivity

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Send unacceptable packets from a foreign system to the packager and document rejection
  - Send unacceptable packets to the scrubber and document log and rejection
  - Attempt to send a packet back from the far-end to the UNCLASSIFIED side and document the packet scrubber log and rejection
  - Document the firewall's refusal to communicate with other systems

- **Final Approval:**
  - Results are written up and submitted for final approval of the live run
