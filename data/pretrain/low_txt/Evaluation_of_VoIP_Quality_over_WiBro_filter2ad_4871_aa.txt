## Abstract
In this work, we evaluate the Quality of Service (QoS) for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications over the WiBro network. We measure and analyze the baseline performance of the WiBro network, focusing on delay and throughput in both stationary and mobile scenarios. Our results show that the maximum achievable throughputs are 5.3 Mbps in downlink and 2 Mbps in uplink. Using the E-Model of ITU-T G.107, we find that VoIP quality is at least as good as toll quality, even when user mobility exceeds the protected limit of WiBro. By combining packet traces with physical layer information, we demonstrate that handoff events correlate with throughput and quality degradation.

## 1. Introduction
Recent advancements in wireless networks, such as 3G cellular and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), offer users various options for Internet access based on their needs and costs. WLANs provide high data rates (up to 54 Mbps) but support low mobility and limited coverage. Cellular networks, on the other hand, support high mobility but with lower bandwidth. Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) systems, such as WiMax and WiBro, aim to bridge the gap between WLANs and cellular networks by offering higher bandwidth than 3G cellular networks while supporting moderate mobility.

WiBro, a mobile BWA solution developed in Korea, is considered a precursor to WiMax. It is based on the IEEE 802.16 family of standards, including the consolidated version of IEEE Standard 802.16-2004 (fixed wireless specifications), P802.16e (enhancements for mobility), and P802.16-2004/Cor1 (corrections). The profiles and test specifications of WiBro are being harmonized with the WiMAX Forum's mobile WiMAX profiles and test specifications, leading to a convergence of the two standards.

Today's Internet users not only write emails and browse the web but also make VoIP calls, play online games, and watch streaming media. These real-time applications have stringent QoS requirements, particularly in terms of delay and loss. While WiMax and WiBro standards define multiple service types to guarantee different levels of QoS, often only the best-effort service is available during the initial deployment phase.

In this study, we conduct experiments to evaluate the QoS of VoIP applications over the WiBro network. We measure and analyze delay, loss, and throughput in both stationary and mobile scenarios. Our results show that the maximum throughputs are 5.3 Mbps in downlink and 2 Mbps in uplink. Packet loss and throughput exhibit more variability in mobile scenarios. Using the E-Model of ITU-T G.107, we evaluate the QoS of VoIP applications and find that VoIP quality is at least as good as toll quality, even in mobile scenarios. By combining packet traces with physical layer information, we show that handoff events are correlated with throughput and quality degradation. We note that the deployed WiBro network is lightly loaded.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we provide background and related work. In Section 3, we describe our experimental setup and evaluation methodology. In Section 4, we present our analysis results. Finally, in Section 5, we summarize our findings.

## 2. Background and Related Work
Fixed WiMax was first used in the relief effort for the 2004 tsunami in Aceh, Indonesia, and now has over 350 service providers worldwide. WiBro, a mobile BWA service, had its public demonstration in December 2005 and has been in service since June 2006 in Korea. The WiBro network architecture consists of Access Control Routers (ACR), Radio Access Stations (RAS), Personal Subscriber Stations (PSS), and the network service provider's IP network. ACRs and RASs use IP for communication, and WiBro uses Time or Frequency Division Duplexing (TDD or FDD) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) for robustness against fast fading and narrow-band co-channel interference.

Five service types have been proposed for 802.16e: Unsolicited Grant Service (UGS), Real-Time Polling Service (rtPS), Extended Real-Time Polling Service (ertPS), Non-Real-Time Polling Service (nrtPS), and Best Effort Service (BE). However, only BE is currently used in Korea.

Previous studies have focused on the performance of the physical and MAC layers using simulations or experiments with limited mobility. In this work, we focus on end-to-end performance at the application layer, considering real-life mobility. Our unique contribution is the empirical measurements from a real, commercially deployed WiBro network.

## 3. Experiment Setup and Evaluation Methodology

### 3.1 WiBro Performance Measurement
KT launched WiBro coverage for nine subway lines in Seoul in April 2007. The Seoul subway system, which moves millions of people daily, reaches almost all corners of the city and major satellite cities. The maximum speed of Seoul subway trains is 90 km/h, and it takes about 1-2 minutes between stations. We chose the subway for our experiments because it is a more common scenario for mobile device usage and easier to conduct measurements.

We conducted our experiments on subway line number 6, which has 38 stations over a total distance of 35.1 km and six RASs. We placed a mobile node (a laptop with a WiBro modem) in the WiBro network and a stationary node (a desktop PC) connected to the Internet over a fixed line. We refer to the laptop as the Mobile Node (MN) and the PC as the Corresponding Node (CN).

To place the CN as close to the WiBro network as possible, we used a PC directly connected to a router on the Korea Research Environment Open Network (KREONET). KREONET is a research network that interconnects supercomputing centers in Korea and serves as a testbed for new networking technologies. It peers with KT's IP backbone network at one of KT's exchange points.

For our experiments, we generated two types of traffic: Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and VoIP. We used iperf for CBR traffic generation and D-ITG for VoIP traffic generation. We configured D-ITG to measure round-trip time (RTT) instead of one-way delay due to the lack of GPS-quality clock synchronization.

Multiple types of handoffs are possible in the WiBro network, including inter-ACR, inter-RAS, and inter-sector handoffs. Using a custom tool, we collected RAS and sector identifiers to pinpoint handoff moments in our data.

### 3.2 VoIP Quality Evaluation
The traditional method for evaluating speech quality is the Mean Opinion Score (MOS). However, MOS is time-consuming, costly, and not repeatable. Objective methods like Perceptual Speech Quality Measure (PSQM) and Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) require a reference signal and predict a MOS value. The ITU-T E-Model, on the other hand, does not require a reference signal and uses a computational model to predict voice quality directly from network measurements.

The E-Model outputs an R-factor, derived from delays and equipment impairment factors. The relationship between the R-factor and MOS is defined by ITU-T G.107:

\[
\text{MOS} = 
\begin{cases} 
1, & \text{if } R \leq 0 \\
1 + 0.035R + R(R - 60) \cdot (100 - R) \cdot 7 \cdot 10^{-6}, & \text{if } 0 < R < 100 \\
4.5, & \text{if } R \geq 100 
\end{cases}
\]

The R-factor ranges from 0 (poor) to 100 (excellent) and can be calculated using the following expression:

\[
R = R_o - I_s - I_d - I_{e-\text{eff}} + A
\]

where:
- \( R_o \): Basic signal-to-noise ratio
- \( I_s \): Simultaneous impairments
- \( I_d \): Delay impairment factor
- \( I_{e-\text{eff}} \): Effective equipment impairment factor
- \( A \): Advantage factor

Cole et al. simplified the equation to:

\[
R = 94.2 - I_d - I_{e-\text{eff}}
\]

where:

\[
I_d = 0.024d + 0.11(d - 177.3)H(d - 177.3)
\]

\[
I_{e-\text{eff}} = 0 + 30\ln(1 + 15e)
\]

In this paper, we use the simplified equation to evaluate WiBro VoIP quality.

## 4. Analysis

On October 5th and 6th, 2007, we conducted CBR and VoIP measurements in Seoul. For stationary experiments, we placed the MN on the KAIST Seoul campus. For mobile experiments, we rode the Seoul subway line 6. We used windump for traffic logging and collected log files including sequence numbers, packet departure times, acknowledgment arrival times, and calculated RTT. The complete set of CBR and VoIP experiments is listed in Table 1.

| Type | Environment | No. of Exps. | Duration (sec) | Rate (Kbps) |
|------|-------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| CBR  | Stationary  | 120          | 300            | 1500~2500 / 5000~6000 |
| CBR  | Stationary  | 300          | 300            | 2000 / 5300  |
| CBR  | Mobile      | 300          | 300            | 2000 / 5300  |
| VoIP | Stationary  | 10           | 300            | 64 / 64      |
| VoIP | Mobile      | 10           | 300            | 64 / 64      |

### 4.1 CBR Traffic Analysis
To capture the baseline performance of the WiBro network, we measured the maximum achievable throughput. We generated traffic from 5 Mbps to 6 Mbps for download and 1.5 Mbps to 2.5 Mbps for upload in 100 Kbps increments and found the bandwidth capped at 5.3 Mbps downlink and 2 Mbps uplink.

We then set the transmission rate of our CBR traffic at 5.3 Mbps for downlink and 2 Mbps for uplink with a packet size of 1460 bytes and saturated the link. We conducted 10 sets of 300-second-long uploads and downloads. Due to space constraints, we present only the downlink performance.

Figure 2(a) shows the throughput of CBR traffic over time. The throughput remains almost constant when the MN is stationary but fluctuates when the MN is mobile. Figure 2(b) plots the inter-quartile dispersion of throughput. In the stationary experiment, the inter-quartile range is small, with most 5-second throughput values converging to 5.3 Mbps. In the mobile experiment, the inter-quartile range spans from 4.1 Mbps to 5.1 Mbps, with more points below 3 Mbps. Figure 2(c) visualizes the variability using a second-order difference plot, showing that the median difference in the mobile environment is about 13 times larger than in the stationary environment. Despite this, the throughput of the MN remains consistently above 1 Mbps.

Next, we analyzed the jitter and loss rates of CBR traffic. Jitter is defined as the difference between sending intervals and arrival intervals. Figure 3(a) shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of CBR traffic jitter. In both stationary and mobile experiments, more than 90% of jitters are below 15 milliseconds, which is encouraging for real-time applications. Figure 3(b) shows that the loss rate in the mobile environment is much higher than in the stationary environment. WiBro uses a MAC layer retransmission mechanism called Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) to reduce loss rates, but this increases delay. Since our CBR traffic used UDP and saturated the link, we expect the loss rates to decrease if we lower the sending rate.

## 5. Conclusion
In this study, we evaluated the QoS of VoIP applications over the WiBro network. We measured and analyzed delay, loss, and throughput in both stationary and mobile scenarios. Our results show that the maximum achievable throughputs are 5.3 Mbps in downlink and 2 Mbps in uplink. Using the E-Model of ITU-T G.107, we found that VoIP quality is at least as good as toll quality, even in mobile scenarios. By combining packet traces with physical layer information, we demonstrated that handoff events are correlated with throughput and quality degradation. This work provides valuable insights into the performance of VoIP over WiBro and highlights the importance of further research in this area.
