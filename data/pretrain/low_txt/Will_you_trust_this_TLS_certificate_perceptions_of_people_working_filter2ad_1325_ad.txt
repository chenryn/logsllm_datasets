### Statistical Analysis and Resource Usage

In the original condition, 6% of participants (2 out of 34) and in the redesigned condition, 2% (1 out of 50) exhibited a certain behavior. However, these differences were not statistically significant (Mann-Whitney-U test for each case).

Regarding resource usage, a similar proportion of participants browsed the Internet in both conditions: 79% (34 out of 43) in the original condition and 68% (21 out of 31) in the redesigned condition. When examining the differences by case (Figure 4), there was a significant decrease in the name constraints case for the redesigned condition, from 72% to 45% (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.029). Additionally, there was a significant reduction in the use of online search in the redesigned condition, with only 62% of those who browsed online using it, compared to 100% in the original condition (χ²(1) = 10.72, p = 0.001).

### Support for Hypothesis

These results support the hypothesis that the redesigned error messages and documentation positively influence resource use. Participants in the redesigned condition required less effort to achieve similar trust assessment and comprehension for the expired, hostname mismatch, and OK cases. Furthermore, they even achieved better results for the self-signed case (trust assessment) and the name constraints case (comprehension).

### Documentation Link Influence

As detailed in Section 2.2, a link to the new documentation website, x509errors.cz, was embedded directly in the reworded validation messages. This link was followed by 71% of the participants in the redesigned condition who browsed online (15 out of 21). It is important to note that all participants who browsed online but did not use online search (8 out of 21) visited only the linked documentation page. People who opened x509errors.cz typically did so for multiple cases (mean 4.2 ± 1.27, median 5). Everyone who consulted the page at least once did so for the name constraints case. Incorporating a documentation link directly into the error message thus proved highly influential, as the page was visited by the majority of browsing participants, often across multiple cases.

#### IT Professionals and TLS Certificates

The environment of X.509 certificates and TLS infrastructure is complex, allowing for a wide variety of issues [12]. Krombholz et al. [26] found that setting up and configuring TLS can be challenging even for IT professionals. In a usability study on deploying TLS on Apache servers, participants with network security knowledge struggled to configure the server correctly. They cited the unavailability of best practice tutorials, misleading terminology, and weak default configurations as key usability shortcomings.

Beyond server configuration, programming APIs also present challenges. Georgiev et al. [19] showed that developers often misunderstand the options, parameters, and return values of widely used TLS implementations, leading to incorrect or absent certificate validation in non-browser software. Ukrop and Matyas [39] conducted another usability study where participants generated and validated certificates using the OpenSSL command line interface. Almost half of the participants incorrectly assumed they had created a valid self-signed certificate, and only 19% could correctly validate the provided certificates, indicating that OpenSSL's usability is far from optimal.

Usability issues are a major obstacle for developers, testers, and administrators in getting TLS configurations and certificate handling right. However, security issues can also be caused by institutional or organizational factors beyond the control of administrators [14]. Fahl et al. [17] found that almost two-thirds of non-validating certificates were deployed deliberately, often because the websites were never intended to be publicly accessible or to save money.

#### End Users and TLS Certificates

In contrast to IT professionals, end users' perceptions of TLS warnings have been extensively studied. Sunshine et al. [38] surveyed 400 browser users in 2008 and found that the majority did not understand the warnings. Interestingly, those who understood the warnings more often adhered to name mismatch warnings but considered warnings for expired certificates as low risk, a trend also observed in our study (Section 3.6).

Felt et al. [18] investigated whether users could understand the threats posed by TLS warnings. Most users misidentified the threat source, and less than 20% understood the actual data at risk. Reeder et al. [32] found that the most common reason for ignoring TLS warnings was connecting to a known trusted website, such as a company-internal site or their own. While warning adherence rates have increased over time for major browsers, comprehension rates remain low, and misconceptions persist [18].

#### Documentation and Error Messages

Our attempts to improve the understanding of security consequences of certificate validation errors were based on reworded error messages and redesigned documentation. Bralo-Lillo et al. [9] found that appropriately adjusted end-user security dialogues led to significantly fewer people ignoring risk indicators. Georgiev et al. [19] emphasized the importance of clean and consistent error reporting, and Gorski and Lo Iacono [21, 22] developed an API-integrated security advice system to nudge developers towards secure decisions.

Several studies have highlighted the crucial role of documentation for security API usability. Robillard [33] argued that documentation and code examples are essential for developers to learn how to use an API. Acar et al. [2] found that IT professionals often resort to online forums and tutorials, which may help them get the code functional but not necessarily secure. Therefore, providing easily accessible documentation with security information and examples of secure code is crucial [1, 2].

### Discussion and Conclusions

We conducted a study with 75 IT professionals to understand their perceptions of flawed TLS certificates. Our study is the first of its kind for IT professionals, and we further investigated how rewording error messages and redesigning documentation can influence comprehension and resource use.

#### Trust Decisions Are Not Binary

From a security perspective, the decision to trust a certificate should be binary: if the certificate does not validate, it should not be trusted. However, our study shows that IT professionals' trust decisions are not necessarily binary and depend on the specific flaw and its context. For example, many participants' trust in expired certificates depended on the time elapsed since expiration, suggesting that expiration time may be used as a proxy to determine whether it was a misconfiguration or an attack. Several participants also mentioned that the reputation of the certificate subject plays a role.

IT professionals also tend to overly trust self-signed and name-constrained certificates, rating them similarly to expired certificates despite worse security implications. This may be a lower bound on trust due to social desirability bias (Section 2.6). The poor understanding of the name constraints case is particularly concerning, as it was also poorly comprehended. For the self-signed case, the context was important, with self-signed certificates on known servers or for internal testing seen as less severe.

#### Security Implications

The security implications of trusting flawed certificates vary. It may be acceptable for a system administrator to trust a deliberately flawed certificate on their own server for testing purposes, but for IT professionals developing applications used by millions of end users, the decision impacts all end users. Delegating the decision to end users is generally a bad idea, as they tend to make uninformed decisions due to a lack of understanding. Given that certificate flaws are common but mostly benign, end users could lose trust in the TLS ecosystem [25, 36]. Therefore, IT professionals should make security decisions during development, testing, and deployment, as they are capable of making better-informed decisions.

Even though IT professionals have the potential to make appropriate security decisions, some still trust invalid certificates: 21% (16 out of 75) said self-signed certificates "look OK" or better, and 20% (15 out of 75) said the same for name-constrained certificates. Thus, certificates with errors are still trusted by some IT professionals.

#### Error and Documentation Design Matters

Our study shows that even a simple content redesign of error messages and documentation positively influences comprehension and trust assessment. Both over-trusted cases (self-signed and name-constrained) were rated lower, and comprehension in the name-constrained case improved significantly (more frequent comprehension codes, fewer incomprehension codes, lower task times, and less Internet browsing). The majority of participants (71%, 15 out of 21) followed the link provided in the reworded error message, highlighting a cost-effective design opportunity to lead users to a trusted unified documentation source.

#### Future Work

While we gained new insights into IT professionals' perceptions of flawed TLS certificates, more research is needed to understand what influences these perceptions and the resulting coping behaviors. We should design systems that embrace the complexity of trust decisions made by IT professionals rather than forcing them to choose a binary option. Improving error message and documentation design is crucial, as even simple changes can have significant effects. The name constraints extension is poorly understood, suggesting that wider deployment might be problematic without additional educational efforts. We plan to propose simple patches to OpenSSL (and possibly other libraries) to reword name constraints error messages and accompanying documentation. More significant changes, such as linking error messages to good documentation or rewriting the documentation to clearly state security implications, may also be beneficial but would require discussion with the developer community.

In conclusion, the TLS certificate ecosystem is complex enough to produce a wide variety of attitudes, opinions, and misconceptions even among IT professionals. To improve the situation, designers need to focus on good developer usability.
