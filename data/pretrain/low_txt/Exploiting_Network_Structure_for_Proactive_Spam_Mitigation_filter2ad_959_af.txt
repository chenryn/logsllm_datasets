### Impact on Legitimate Mail and Spam
- **Legitimate Mail:** At an overload factor of 1, the greedy algorithm achieves an average throughput of 95%, while the history-based policy achieves 93%. However, the history-based policies accept slightly more legitimate mail than the greedy policy.
- **Spam Acceptance:** At an overload factor of 1, the history-based policies accept only 0.3-1% less spam than the greedy algorithm. As the overload factor increases, the amount of spam accepted decreases. For example, at an overload factor of 2, the history-based policies accept 50.2-65.5% of the spam. At an overload factor of 4, they accept less than half the spam compared to the greedy policy.

### Conclusion
- The history-based policies significantly and consistently outperform the greedy policy under overload conditions, as evidenced by multiple metrics.
- These policies do not significantly impact server performance when the server is not overloaded.
- When the server is heavily overloaded, the history-based policies effectively reduce the amount of spam accepted, thereby mitigating the impact on legitimate mail.

### Appendix: Policy Details for Phase 1
- **Policy Overview:**
  - If the load is less than 75% of capacity, all SMTP connection requests are accepted.
  - If the load exceeds 75% of capacity, the policy considers the reputation of the IP address and the expected future mail volume.
  - The policy uses a distribution of the number of emails expected in the next t time units from IP addresses with reputations up to k.
  - **Reputation Function:** Lifetime spam-ratio (low value = good, high value = bad).
  - **Decision Process:**
    - Compute the smallest k0 such that all expected mail with reputations ≤ k0 can be processed.
    - Check the reputation of the IP address:
      - If the IP address has no known reputation, it is assigned a higher k0.
      - If k0 ≤ k, the connection request is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected.
