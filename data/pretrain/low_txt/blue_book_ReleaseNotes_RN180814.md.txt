## AzSK v3.5.* (Released: 180814)
### Feature Updates

#### Security Verification Tests (SVTs)
- **New Controls for Azure Container Registry (ACR):** Enhanced security controls have been added to the SVT suite, specifically for Azure Container Registry.

#### ARM Template Checker
- **Support for Multiple API Versions:** The ARM template checker now supports multiple API versions for resource types. These versions can be configured at the organizational level, providing greater flexibility and control.

#### CICD SVT Extension
- **Multiple SVT Task Instances in a Single Pipeline:** Users can now add multiple SVT task instances within the same pipeline. Each instance will generate logs in its own separate folder.
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** The SVT task will no longer pass silently if an AzSK scan is not performed. This ensures that any issues are clearly identified.
- **Default Treatment of Control Statuses:** Control statuses other than 'Passed' or 'Error' will now be treated as 'Failed' by default.
- **Customizable Behavior with New Pipeline Variable:** A new pipeline variable, `TreatAsPassed`, has been introduced. This allows users to control the behavior of the SVT extension for various control statuses. For example, you can configure the extension to treat statuses such as 'Verify', 'Manual', 'Exception', or 'Remediate' as 'Passed'.

#### Org-Policy Feature Updates (Non-CSE)
- **Dependency Upgrade:** AzSK 3.5.0 now requires AzureRM version 6.x. This upgrade introduces breaking changes for `RunbookCoreSetup` and `RunbookScanAgent` in custom org policies. If you are upgrading your org policy with AzSK 3.5.0 using configurations (AzSK.Pre.Json), you will need to update the runbook files with the `Update-AzSKOrganizationPolicy` command. Customized files will need to be reconfigured after the update.
- **Local Policy Deployment:** Policy owners can now deploy policies to a local folder, significantly improving the debugging and troubleshooting experience. Policy changes can be pre-tested locally, eliminating the need for a separate dev-test policy server endpoint.
- **Automated SAS Token Expiry Handling:** Support for handling the expiry of SAS tokens in the policy URL has been added. This is automated in both local setups and CA, but CICD extension scenarios will require explicit updates. Warnings will be displayed 30 days before the token expires.
- **Schema Validation for Org Policy Config JSON:** The `Get-AzSKOrganizationPolicyStatus` command now includes schema validation for org policy config JSON, reducing the likelihood of errors due to oversight or copy-paste mistakes.
- **Custom Scan Event Listeners:** Teams that extend the AzSK module can now add custom listeners to receive scan events, enhancing the customization and integration capabilities.

### Other Improvements and Bug Fixes

#### SVTs
- **Command Aliases and Hints:** Helpful hints for command aliases have been added to make users aware of shortcut approaches for invoking their favorite AzSK commands (e.g., `grs`, `gss`, `gca`, etc.). All command and parameter aliases have been uniformly named.

#### Performance Improvements
- **Optimized Permission Checks:** Permission checks for control attestations have been optimized. Redundant role definition calls during RBAC-related controls have been removed, improving performance.

#### Controls
- **Fixed Port Range Parsing Issue:** The control `Azure_VirtualMachine_NetSec_Dont_Open_Management_Ports` has been fixed to correctly parse port ranges, ensuring accurate evaluation.
- **Telemetry for PIM Activation:** Telemetry has been added to identify accounts where Privileged Identity Management (PIM) has not been activated.
- **Fixed Spurious Alerts in KeyVault Controls:** An issue causing spurious alerts in multiple KeyVault controls (e.g., `Azure_KeyVault_DP_Keys_Secrets_Check_Expiry_Date`) during the `ListKeys` operation has been resolved.
- **Telemetry for ADF Controls:** Telemetry has been added to ADF controls to gain visibility into commonly used linked services in the context of big data pipelines.

#### Other
- **Migration to AzureRM 6.x:** The DevOps Kit (AzSK) PowerShell module has been migrated from AzureRM 5.x to AzureRM 6.x. The transition to the new dependency will be handled seamlessly across all AzSK usage modes (SDL, CICD, CA).
