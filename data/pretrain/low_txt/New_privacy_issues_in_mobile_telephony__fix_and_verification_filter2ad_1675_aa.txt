## Abstract
Mobile telephony equipment is carried daily by billions of subscribers. Ensuring that these subscribers cannot be linked by third parties and protecting their privacy are key goals of mobile telecommunication protocols. We use formal methods to model and analyze the security properties of 3G protocols. We identify two novel threats to user privacy in 3G telephony systems, which enable tracing and identifying mobile subscribers, and demonstrate the feasibility of low-cost implementations of these attacks. We propose fixes for these privacy issues, addressing known vulnerabilities from the literature. Using the automatic verification tool ProVerif, we prove that our privacy-friendly fixes satisfy the desired unlinkability and anonymity properties.

## 1. Introduction
While most mobile phone users accept that network operators can track their geographical movements, few would be comfortable if an arbitrary third party could do so. Such a possibility could lead to undesirable behavior, including criminal stalking, harassment, monitoring of spouse or employee movements, and profiling for commercial and advertising purposes. To prevent this, 3G (Third Generation) mobile phone protocols are designed to prevent third parties from identifying wireless messages as coming from a specific mobile phone. Instead, mobile phones use temporary identifiers (TMSIs) rather than long-term unique identities (IMSIs). These temporary identities are periodically updated and encrypted using a session key established through the 3G Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol.

When 3G protocols were introduced in 1999, active attack scenarios were unlikely due to the high cost of required equipment, closed hardware design, and lack of open-source implementations. However, recent developments have changed this scenario. Cheap base stations can now be produced using USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) boards, making radio devices more affordable. This has led to the implementation of fake base station attacks on GSM, once considered too costly for widespread use. Open-source projects like openBSC and osmocom-BB have also contributed to the reprogramming of old mobile phones, opening the way for both new uses and exploitation of weaknesses in mobile telephony technology.

Given these developments, we believe active attackers should be considered in the analysis of mobile systems to obtain reliable security results. In this paper, we present a formal analysis of 3G subscriber privacy, exposing two novel threats and demonstrating their feasibility with cheap equipment. We propose privacy-friendly fixes and formally verify that these fixes achieve the desired privacy goals using ProVerif.

## 2. Background and Related Work
### 2.1 3G Security Requirements
3G, specified and maintained by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), was introduced in 1999 to offer better support for mobile data applications, increased data rates, and lower costs of mobile data communications. It also provides improved security over previous systems like GSM, aiming to ensure authentication, confidentiality of data and voice communication, and user privacy. Specifically, 3G privacy goals include:
- **User identity confidentiality**: The permanent user identity (IMSI) should not be eavesdropped on the radio access link.
- **User untraceability**: An intruder should not be able to deduce whether different services are delivered to the same user by eavesdropping on the radio access link.

To achieve these goals, 3G uses TMSIs for identifying and paging mobile phones instead of IMSIs. The 3G standard requires periodic updates of TMSIs to avoid traceability, and new TMSIs are encrypted using a session key established by the 3G AKA protocol.

### 2.2 Related Work
#### Known 3G Vulnerabilities
- **IMSI Catcher**: This well-known attack forces a mobile phone to reveal its IMSI by triggering the identification procedure from a fake base station. Until recently, implementing an IMSI catcher required specialized software and equipment, but such devices have become more affordable.
- **3G/GSM Interoperability**: Attacks exploiting vulnerabilities propagated from GSM to 3G take advantage of the lack of mutual authentication and weak encryption in GSM. These attacks cannot be carried out on pure 3G networks.
- **3G Specific**: Zhang and Fang's attack, a variant of the false base station attack, allows the redirection of outgoing traffic to a different network, exploiting the fact that the mobile station does not authenticate the serving network.

#### Previous Formal Analysis
The 3G AKA protocol has been formally proven to meet some security requirements, such as authentication and confidentiality. However, privacy-related properties like unlinkability and anonymity have not been analyzed. Our work focuses on these properties, using formal methods to define and verify them.

#### Other Work on 3G Privacy Enhancement
A new framework for authentication has been proposed to provide subscriber privacy with respect to the network, achieving MSs anonymity and location privacy. However, this work lacks a formal model of the AKA protocol and does not provide formal verification of the proposed protocols.

## 3. Novel Privacy Threats
In this section, we describe two breaches of privacy that expose a subscriber's identity and allow an attacker to identify the presence of a target mobile phone in a monitored area or track its movements. The attacker does not need to know any keys or perform cryptographic operations. These vulnerabilities often remain unnoticed because they result from errors in the protocol logic.

As argued in Section 1 and demonstrated in Section 4, a convincing analysis of 3G privacy and security should consider active attackers. We assume the attacker has unlimited access to the radio link between the mobile station and the base station, allowing them to sniff, inject, replay, and modify messages. This attacker model is consistent with previous work on GSM/3G security.
