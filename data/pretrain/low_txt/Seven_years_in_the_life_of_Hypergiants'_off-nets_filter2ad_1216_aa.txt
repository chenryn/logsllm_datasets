## Abstract

Content Hypergiants (HGs) deliver the majority of Internet traffic to end users. In recent years, some HGs have heavily invested in deploying services and servers inside end-user networks. With several dozen HGs and thousands of servers deployed, these off-net (outside the HG networks) deployments are reshaping the Internet's structure. Previous studies have relied on proprietary data or specialized per-HG measurement techniques, which neither scale nor generalize, providing a limited view of content delivery on today’s Internet.

In this paper, we develop a generic and easily implementable methodology to measure the expansion of HGs' off-nets. Our key observation is that HGs increasingly encrypt their traffic to protect user privacy. By analyzing publicly available Internet-wide scans of port 443 and retrieving TLS certificates, we can identify IP addresses hosting HG certificates and infer the networks hosting off-nets for the corresponding HGs. Our results show that the number of networks hosting HG off-nets has tripled from 2013 to 2021, reaching 4.5k networks. The largest HGs dominate these deployments, with almost all networks hosting an off-net for at least one—and increasingly two or more—of Google, Netflix, Facebook, or Akamai. These four HGs have off-nets within networks that provide access to a significant fraction of the end-user population.

## 1 Introduction

The vast majority of Internet traffic comes from a small number of content providers, cloud providers, and content delivery networks (CDNs) that are heavy traffic outbound, including Google, Netflix, Facebook, and Akamai. These providers, dubbed Hypergiants (HGs) by Labovitz et al. [64], deliver content to billions of users worldwide. In 2019, more than half of Internet traffic originated from only five HGs [32, 85, 104], a significant consolidation since 2009, when it took the largest 150 ASes to contribute half the traffic, and 2007, when it took thousands of ASes [64].

To meet the increasing demand for high-quality content, HGs invest heavily in their infrastructure. They build data centers [54, 96] and roll out fiber to construct their backbone [10, 16, 62]. They peer at colocation facilities and Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) worldwide [48, 90, 113] and directly with eyeball networks, bypassing transit providers to improve performance and reduce costs [10, 11, 28, 40, 64, 69, 81]. For example, Google peers with over 7.5k networks [11] (ca. 2020), establishing peerings at more than 100 colocation facilities and 150 IXPs [50].

### HG’s Off-net Footprint

HGs operate their own networks and data centers, with servers assigned IP addresses from their own ASes. Some HGs also install servers inside eyeball or other networks to serve users in those networks or their customers [53, 69, 79, 81]. These servers are assigned IP addresses of the hosting network. Since 2000, Akamai has deployed servers in hundreds of networks globally [69, 81]. We refer to these servers as off-nets because they are outside the HG’s own network, in contrast to on-nets hosted on the HG’s network (see Figure 1). More recently, other HGs have followed this model, such as Google’s Global Cache [53], Netflix’s Open Connect [79], and Facebook [89] and Alibaba [7] operating their own CDNs.

Despite the dominant role of HGs in delivering Internet content, the research community lacks general and scalable methods to track their growth and impact on the Internet topology.

### Why Measure Hypergiant Off-nets?

Tracking the expansion of HGs inside other networks, especially eyeball networks, has implications for modeling Internet structure and traffic flow. Deploying off-nets localizes HG content within the hosting network, reducing cross-network traffic. This challenges the traditional understanding of peering and exchanged traffic and impacts net neutrality regulation. It also affects network performance, as crossing network boundaries incurs costs [28, 44, 69]. Operating servers within a network improves the strategic position of HGs, allowing them to control both origin and off-net servers, optimizing content delivery. Understanding if major HGs, responsible for 90% of end-user traffic, are expanding into emerging networks (e.g., 5G) that require close proximity to mobile users and performance guarantees is crucial. The research community lacks a comprehensive understanding of global expansion strategies and the extent to which the Internet population can be served locally. Such insights inform studies in economics, political science, and regulation. Section 8 revisits these topics in light of our findings on HG off-net footprints.

### Challenges and Previous Work

Off-net servers of large HGs (e.g., Google, Netflix, Facebook, Akamai, and others) typically use IP addresses announced by the hosting network, making it difficult to identify them using traditional techniques like inspecting BGP feeds. Alternative approaches either require distributed vantage points, limiting coverage, or are tailored to specific HGs, lacking generality and robustness to changes.

The first category of earlier approaches relies on issuing DNS queries from many locations, as HGs direct users to specific servers by resolving DNS queries to server IP addresses. These approaches use distributed measurement platforms [88, 102], open recursive resolvers [55, 105], or crowdsourced requests [3, 74]. Studies on YouTube’s infrastructure have used five vantage points in different networks [103] and a combination of open DNS resolvers and PlanetLab [2]. However, these techniques do not achieve truly global coverage, which becomes problematic as HGs expand and use anycast [23]. Additionally, using open resolvers raises ethical concerns.

The second category uses DNS-based techniques tailored to individual HGs. Studies emulate issuing DNS queries from around the world using the DNS Extension Client-Subnet (ECS), which allows a DNS query to include the client’s IP prefix, enabling researchers to issue queries that appear to come from arbitrary locations/prefixes [22, 101]. However, many HGs do not support ECS, and even those that do may only respond to whitelisted resolvers [26]. Furthermore, Google now only responds to DNS queries for domains like www.google.com with on-net server IP addresses, rendering ECS-based mapping ineffective. Other studies have mapped Facebook [13-15] and Netflix [17] off-nets by exploiting naming schemes in off-net DNS records, then exhaustively trying queries based on those patterns. This approach is fragile, tedious, and not scalable, as hostname patterns may change and are not generalizable.

### Our Approach

We present the first approach for identifying off-nets that is both general, working across HGs, and complete, achieving global coverage of their off-net footprints. Our approach leverages existing public datasets, enabling a longitudinal study of off-net deployment growth.

Our approach relies on two key observations. First, HG off-net servers host the HG’s Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate(s) and must provide the certificate(s) in response to queries. Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in TLS adoption, with the majority of Internet traffic now encrypted [32]. Encryption adoption is particularly high among HGs, with Google’s encrypted traffic increasing from 50% in 2014 to 95% in 2020 [51].

A TLS certificate validates the identity of a service run on a server, so a server possessing an HG’s certificate indicates it is an HG server. If a server outside the HG’s network has the certificate, it is an off-net for the HG, an observation validated later in the paper. Because TLS certificates and message exchanges are standardized, TLS scans of the IP address space provide a method to identify off-nets that works for any HG (that uses TLS) and covers all publicly-addressable servers.

Second, our approach uses standard TLS scans, allowing us to leverage existing certificate corpuses for historical and longitudinal analysis. Such corpuses are readily available for commercial and research use, e.g., from Rapid7 [87] and Censys [36].

Combining the wide adoption of TLS and available certificate datasets provides an opportunity to infer the off-net footprints of all HGs and enhance the community’s understanding of Internet content delivery.

### Our Contributions

- **Generic Methodology:** We develop a generic methodology to infer all HGs’ off-net footprints by analyzing scanned certificate corpuses. We augment our methodology with HTTP(S) header analysis to differentiate HG services hosted on third-party platforms (e.g., Netflix web servers running in AWS) from HG services running on their own servers (e.g., Netflix Open Connect video caches).
- **Longitudinal Analysis:** By applying our methodology to certificate corpuses spanning seven years (2013-2021), we find that the number of ASes hosting HG off-net installations has tripled, reaching 4.5k in April 2021. We validate our results by surveying HG operators, who indicated that we correctly uncovered 89-95% of ASes hosting their off-nets.
- **Dominance of Major HGs:** Of networks hosting any HG off-nets, the majority host at least one of the four largest HGs (Google, Netflix, Facebook, and Akamai), which are the largest in terms of the number of networks with off-nets.
- **Network Characteristics:** ASes that already host at least one HG tend to host more over time. Most off-nets are in small and medium ASes, which is not surprising given that most ASes are small, but a disproportionate share of large ASes also host them.
- **Geographic Expansion:** HGs have rapidly expanded their off-net footprints in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, with exponential growth in the latter.
- **End-User Impact:** As a result of this expansion, a significant fraction of the end-user population can be potentially served by the off-net deployments of Google, Netflix, Facebook, and Akamai.
- **Different Strategies:** Our analysis reveals different strategies among HGs. While some focus on rapid expansion, others prioritize strategic placement in key networks.
