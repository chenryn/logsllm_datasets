## Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a novel coding scheme, Code-M, which is a non-Maximum Distance Separable (non-MDS) erasure code designed to support fast recovery from up to two-disk failures in storage systems. Code-M achieves this by trading off the rate for faster recovery times while maintaining the RAID-6 property. The parity chain length in Code-M is fixed at \(2C - 1\) for a given number of columns \(C\) in a strip-set, and the rate, or the percentage of disk space occupied by non-parity data, is \(\frac{C-1}{C}\). Our theoretical analysis and evaluation show that Code-M offers significant improvements in recovery performance compared to existing MDS RAID-6 codes, such as RDP, with up to a 5.18x speedup under single disk failure and a 2.8x speedup under double disk failures.

## 1. Introduction
Since Patterson et al. introduced the concept of Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) [13], it has become a popular choice for high-performance storage systems due to its ability to provide high reliability and acceptable monetary cost. In recent years, RAID-6, which can tolerate the concurrent failure of any two disks, has gained increasing importance in providing high reliability and performance. However, traditional MDS RAID-6 codes, such as EVENODD, RDP, and Cauchy Reed-Solomon codes, suffer from long parity chains, which reduce reconstruction performance. Non-MDS codes, such as HoVer and WEAVER, attempt to address these issues but often come with low rates and complex implementations.

To address these challenges, we propose a new scheme, Code-M, which aims to improve the recovery performance of RAID-6 under faulty conditions. We make the following contributions in this paper:

1. **Description of Code-M**: We describe Code-M, a non-MDS RAID-6 construction based on strip-sets, which offers better recovery performance than MDS RAID-6 codes at a small rate cost.
2. **Lowest Density Codes**: Code-M makes lowest density codes that offer optimal write/update complexity, reducing the I/O and computational complexity during reconstruction.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Our evaluation shows that Code-M consistently decreases the I/O and computational complexity of reconstruction in degraded mode with both single and double disk drive failures, demonstrating significant speedups compared to RDP.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background and related work. Section 3 presents the architecture of Code-M. Section 4 details our performance analysis and evaluation. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Definitions
- **n**: Represents the result of \(M \mod n\), ranging from 0 to \(n-1\).
- **Element**: The fundamental unit in erasure codes, which can be a bit up to continuous sectors on a disk drive. Elements are either data elements or parity elements.
- **Stripe**: An independent set of data and parity elements in an erasure code, which can tolerate the failure of both its data and parity elements.
- **Strip**: A set of all the continuous elements on a disk drive in a stripe.
- **Parity Chain**: A set containing the parity element and all the elements used to build it.
- **Parity Chain Length**: The number of all elements in a parity chain, including the parity element itself.

### 2.2 RAID-6 Based on MDS Codes
There are various MDS codes that RAID-6 can be based on, including Reed-Solomon codes [15], Liber8tion [18], Cauchy Reed-Solomon codes [2], EVENODD codes [1], RDP codes [5], Blaum-Roth codes [14], Cyclic codes [4], X-codes [24], and P-codes [11]. These codes have a common disadvantage: each parity element requires at least \(n-2\) elements on different disk drives, leading to long parity chains and reduced reconstruction performance.

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the parity construction of typical MDS codes: a horizontal code (RDP) and a vertical code (X-code). These figures highlight the long parity chains, which become a bottleneck in RAID-6 schemes based on MDS codes.

## 3. Architecture of Code-M
Code-M is designed to address the limitations of MDS RAID-6 codes by trading off the rate for faster recovery times. The key features of Code-M include:

- **Fixed Parity Chain Length**: The parity chain length in Code-M is fixed at \(2C - 1\) for a given number of columns \(C\) in a strip-set.
- **Optimal Write/Update Complexity**: Code-M ensures that updates to an element incur minimal additional writes and I/O seeks, improving overall performance.
- **Lowest Density Codes**: Code-M constructs lowest density codes, which offer optimal write/update complexity and reduce the I/O and computational complexity during reconstruction.

## 4. Performance Analysis and Evaluation
We performed theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation to compare the performance of Code-M with existing MDS RAID-6 codes, such as RDP. Our results show that Code-M consistently outperforms RDP in terms of recovery performance, with up to a 5.18x speedup under single disk failure and a 2.8x speedup under double disk failures.

## 5. Conclusion
In this paper, we presented Code-M, a non-MDS erasure code scheme designed to support fast recovery from up to two-disk failures in storage systems. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation demonstrate that Code-M offers significant improvements in recovery performance compared to existing MDS RAID-6 codes. Future work will focus on further optimizing Code-M and exploring its applicability in various storage system configurations.
