## Abstract
Security and privacy in smartphones and mobile devices have garnered significant attention from the research community in recent years. The SPSM workshop was established to bring together researchers and practitioners in this field. Building on the success of the previous two editions, this third edition attracted a higher number of submissions and benefited from an expanded international program committee.

## 1. Introduction
Mobile devices, such as smartphones and Internet tablets, now possess computing and networking capabilities comparable to traditional personal computers. While their widespread adoption has been a boon, it has also introduced significant security and privacy concerns. For instance, the proliferation of information-stealing applications poses substantial risks. The operating systems supporting these devices offer both advantages and disadvantages in terms of security. On one hand, they employ application sandboxing to contain exploits and limit the privileges of malware. On the other hand, they collect and organize sensitive information, making it easily accessible to third-party applications.

Recognizing the importance of smartphone security and privacy, the SPSM workshop was launched three years ago to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas. This third edition builds on the success of the two previous well-attended workshops.

## 2. Topics of Interest
Authors were invited to submit either Full Research Papers (up to 12 pages) or Short Papers (up to 6 pages). Full Research Papers should present mature and complete research results on security and privacy in smartphones and mobile devices. Short Papers should define new problems or provide inspiring visions in the same domain. The call for papers highlighted the following topics:

- Device/hardware security
- OS/Middleware security
- Application security
- Authenticating users to devices and services
- Mobile Web Browsers
- Usability
- Privacy
- Rogue application detection and recovery
- Vulnerability detection and remediation
- Secure application development
- Cloud support for mobile security

We particularly encouraged novel paradigms and controversial ideas not listed above. The workshop aims to foster creative debate and interaction in security- and privacy-sensitive areas of computing and communication impacted by smartphones.

## 3. Workshop Program
This year, we received a record 54 submissions from 19 different countries across Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa. The program committee accepted 5 full papers and 8 short papers, covering a variety of topics, including detecting malware on smartphones, attacks and defenses against mobile devices, and authentication and privacy issues of mobile users. We are honored to have Jon Geator, Chief Technology Officer of Trustonic, deliver the keynote speech. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for security researchers and developers.

To ensure a high-quality review process, we expanded the program committee and invited several mobile security experts from outside North America. Each paper received at least three expert reviews. We extend our gratitude to the program committee members for their dedication and hard work.
