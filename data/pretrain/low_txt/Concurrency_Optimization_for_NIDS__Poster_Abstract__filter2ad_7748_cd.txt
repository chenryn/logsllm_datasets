**Abstract:**
The intestine is a critical organ for the absorption and metabolism of nutrients essential for survival. Conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can disrupt nutrient uptake, leading to various health issues in patients. Current clinical tests for monitoring intestinal functionality are often invasive, non-specific, or unable to detect subtle changes. During inflammation, arachidonic acid (AA) is released through phospholipase A-2-mediated hydrolysis of epithelial phospholipids and further metabolized into prostaglandins and other eicosanoids. To address this, we aim to establish a stable-isotope-mediated metabolomics platform to monitor intestinal function using stable isotope-labeled AA.

For proof-of-concept, we used the Caco-2 cell model and induced an inflammatory response with interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ. We then fed the Caco-2 cells with 13C-labeled AA and evaluated its incorporation into phospholipids and downstream metabolites. To monitor phospholipid changes, we developed a shotgun lipidomics platform using nano-electrospray coupled to a Q-Exactive HF orbitrap mass spectrometer. For the evaluation of eicosanoid release, we employed a targeted UPLC-MS/MS method (for 130 eicosanoids) on an API 6500 QTRAP system.

Our initial results confirmed the uptake of 13C-AA in Caco-2 cells and the release of prostaglandins from cytokine-stimulated Caco-2 cells. These findings will be further optimized to understand the dynamics of inflammatory processes and applied to various in-vivo systems.

**Isotype-Specific Regulation of Whole-Body Gluconeogenesis by AAK/AMPK in Live C. elegans Observed with Real-Time In-Organism NMR Metabolomics**

**Abstract:**
Traditional metabolomics involves sample extraction from tissues and cells, which limits the ability to understand actual metabolic flux in a living system at the whole-organism level. By combining whole-body 13C-labeling, NMR spectroscopy, and optimized sampling methods, we developed an in-organism NMR metabolomics approach for live C. elegans. This approach allows real-time monitoring of metabolic activity at the whole-body level with high sensitivity and resolution.

When applied to C. elegans with mutations in AAK/AMPK, a key metabolic regulator, our method revealed unique roles for the AAK-1 and AAK-2 isotypes. Specifically, aak-1 knockout animals showed enhanced glucose production under starvation, while aak-2 knockout animals exhibited the opposite effect. The unusually high compensatory expression of the reciprocal isotypes in each mutant and the results for the double knockout suggest an unconventional phenotype-genotype relationship and the epistasis of aak-2 over aak-1 in glucose production.

Mechanistically, gene expression and 13C-isotope incorporation data indicated that aak-1 KO metabotypes result from reduced TCA cycle and glycolysis and enhanced gluconeogenesis through the activation of fatty acid oxidation and the glyoxylate shunt. Our approach highlights the isotype-specific roles of the catalytic subunits of AAK/AMPK and can be readily applied to other metabolic models involving C. elegans.

**Wikidata and Scholia as a Hub Linking Metabolite Knowledge**

**Presenting Author:** Egon Willighagen, Maastricht University, Netherlands

**Co-Authors:** Denise Slenter, Daniel Mietchen, Chris T. Evelo, Finn Å. Nielsen

**Abstract:**
Enhancing the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles of chemical databases supports the identification of unexpected chemical compounds (e.g., toxicants, drug metabolites) in untargeted metabolomics experiments. We discuss the role of Wikidata, a machine-readable database, in boosting the interoperability of metabolite databases. Thanks to the Wikidata:WikiProject Chemistry community, there is a growing amount of information about metabolites, with over 150,000 compounds having InChIKeys and 70,000 CAS numbers.

Ongoing work includes capturing chemical classes and compounds in various Wikipedias as machine-readable data. Other projects cover human drugs, MeSH Chemicals and Drugs, and volatile organic compounds. We contribute to the WikiProject Chemistry by proposing Wikidata properties to annotate compounds with database identifiers for the EPA CompTox Dashboard, SPLASH, and MassBank. Additionally, we use Bioclipse and QuickStatements to add missing compounds for biological pathways from WikiPathways.

We also introduce an extension of Scholia, which visualizes data about compounds and compound classes, including external identifiers, physicochemical properties, and an overview of the literature from which the knowledge is derived. Currently, three thousand chemicals are linked to more than 170,000 research articles.

**Optimization of Nanoelectrospray Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry Metabolomics for 96-Well Based In Vitro High-Throughput Screening**

**Presenting Author:** Julia Malinowska, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom

**Co-Authors:** Julia M. Malinowska, Taina Palosaari, Jukka Sund, Donatella Carpi, Maurice Whelan, Mark R. Viant

**Abstract:**
High-throughput screening (HTS) is becoming a recognized approach for supporting decision-making in chemical safety assessment, while in vitro metabolomics is a promising tool for reducing the use of animal models in toxicity testing. The objective of this study was to integrate high-resolution spectral-stitching nanoelectrospray direct infusion mass spectrometry (nanoDIMS) metabolomics (University of Birmingham) with an HTS platform (EU Reference Laboratory for Alternatives to Animal Testing).

Low biomass cell samples (50,000 hepatocytes of HepaRG per well) were prepared for metabolomics analyses using a newly established automated protocol and solvent system (Biomek FXp laboratory automated workstation) and analyzed using a modified nanoDIMS method (Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Elite) suitable for small sample sizes. The proposed method was assessed for sensitivity and reproducibility, demonstrating acceptable sensitivity (>3,500 non-background peaks routinely detected) and intra- and inter-plate variability (median relative standard deviation <30%) in both polar and nonpolar nanoDIMS assays.

Baseline characterization of HepaRG endogenous metabolism over time and a pilot study with a model toxicant (cadmium chloride) are underway, revealing changes in the metabolome over a 48-hour culture period. This new analytical method shows that in vitro metabolomics can be readily applied as an additional high-content assay in 96-well HTS, complementing transcriptomic and imaging phenotypic measures.
