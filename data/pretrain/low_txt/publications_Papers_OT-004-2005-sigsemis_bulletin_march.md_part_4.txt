### Working Principles
The First Online Conference on Metadata and Semantics Research (MTSR'05) is designed to provide a different type of interaction compared to conventional conferences. 

- **Peer Review Process**: Papers submitted to the conference will undergo a standard blind peer-review procedure. Accepted papers will be included in the online proceedings, which will be available before the conference to maximize opportunities for discussion.
- **Virtual Sessions**: Authors of accepted papers will be responsible for presenting their papers and answering questions in virtual sessions with asynchronous communication during the conference days. Discussions will be recorded and used to improve the papers, which will be published in post-proceedings after the conference.

### Call for Papers
The Semantic Web (SW) presents new challenges to Information Systems. This track aims to fill the gap in multidisciplinary contributions and insights, demystifying the Semantic Web and revealing novel opportunities for value exploitation. The focus is on the practical implications and research challenges of SW in the context of Information Systems, with an emphasis on theoretical constructions and linkages to multidisciplinary references.

**Suggested Topics:**
- Semantic Web issues, challenges, and implications in IS research streams
- Development of the Knowledge society
- New Semantic Web-enabled tools for citizens, learners, organizations, and businesses
- New Semantic Web-enabled business models
- New Semantic Web-enabled Information systems and knowledge repositories
- Integration with other disciplines
- Intelligent Systems
- Standards
- Semantic-enabled business intelligence
- Enterprise Application Integration
- Metadata-driven (bottom-up) versus ontology-driven (top-down) SW development

**Best Paper Award**: The best paper will be invited for publication in the AIS SIGSEMIS official peer-reviewed journal, the International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems.

### Formal Ontologies Meet Industry – FOMI 2005
[http://www.loa-cnr.it/Files/fomi]
[http://fandango.cs.unitn.it/fomi/]

**June 9-10, 2005, Lazise, Lake of Garda, Verona, Italy**

**Organized by:**
- University of Verona
- Creactive Consulting S.r.l., Affi
- Laboratory for Applied Ontology, ISTC-CNR, Trento

**Supported by:**
- Knowledgeboard
- Knowledgeweb

**Description:**
Modeling corporate knowledge is a significant theme in applied research, with strategic relevance in the business world. Theoretical results have proven effective in real applications such as data warehouse construction, information infrastructure definition, and knowledge management processes. These knowledge models aim to provide a framework for information and knowledge sharing, reliable information exchange, meaning negotiation, and coordination between distinct organizations or members of the same organization.

**Objectives:**
- The workshop serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss problems, solutions, perspectives, and research directions.
- We welcome papers or project descriptions that apply formal ontologies in industry, including:
  - Theoretical studies on formal ontologies to provide sound bases for industrial applications and formal representation of corporate knowledge.
  - Business experiences and case studies that highlight concrete problems and possible solutions.
