### 101) Network Usage Analysis

We analyzed network usage at four distinct periods throughout the day: 5–6 am, 9–10 am, 3–4 pm, and 6–7 pm, corresponding to the peaks and valleys shown in Figure 4. For each time period and region, we present the number of clients, their activity time, and the total bytes transferred. To facilitate comparisons across different time periods and geographic areas while preserving user privacy, we normalized the histograms for each value (bytes, activity, and users) to the average for that value across all client classes and time periods. The sum of all histograms for a particular value is 36.

#### Geographic Variations in Network Use

Significant differences were observed in network use across the geographic areas. Not only do the proportions of modem, smartphone, and hotspot users vary by location, but the usage patterns within these user classes also differ substantially.

- **Transit Area (Highway 101):** Smartphones are the most prevalent device type, but they show almost no usage. In contrast, the few hotspot users transfer more data cumulatively than the smartphones.
- **Residential Area:** Smartphones are less common, appearing in similar numbers to hotspot users. However, the smartphones in this area are substantially more active than those in the transit area. Modem users represent a significant fraction of residential usage, particularly in terms of traffic and activity, and their usage appears less time-dependent than other devices.
- **Commercial Area:** This area is the most active, with significant usage across all three client classes. Modem activity is similar to that in residential areas, but the absolute number of both smartphones and hotspot users is significantly higher. Mobile (i.e., smartphone and hotspot) usage peaks in the middle of the afternoon, with a normalized byte count of 6.2 and a user count of 5.4, and remains strong across all periods. 

Unsurprisingly, the number of clients in the transit area peaks during rush hours, while residential usage is highest during the evening.

### 6.2 Concentration

For a metropolitan network covering an entire city, it is important to understand the extent to which the full set of nodes in the network are actively being used. Figure 16 shows the average number of simultaneous clients supported by each Access Point (AP) over the course of a day. Clients are distributed widely, with the busiest AP supporting just over 14 simultaneous clients. All but the least-utilized 5% of APs serve at least one client on average, indicating that all APs contribute substantially to the network coverage.

The number of clients using the network varies by a factor of two over the course of the day. Figure 17 plots the number of access points in use throughout the day for several definitions of "in use." Even in the dead of night, over 80% of the APs are servicing at least one client. The diurnal usage pattern is more apparent when considering heavily used APs, e.g., those with three or more simultaneous clients.

To ensure that removing lightly used APs does not leave some clients without access, we plot a final line, "no oscillations," which counts only APs that are servicing one or more clients that have no alternative. Because we do not have access to client-side 802.11 information, we consider a client to have an alternative AP if it is currently associated with an AP that has been (or will be) involved in oscillatory behavior at some point that day.

Figure 18 replots the "any clients" line from Figure 17, comparing it against the APs that supported at least 100 and 1000 seconds of activity in aggregate per 15-minute interval, respectively. Figure 19 shows the results of successively removing nodes in sorted order of increasing activity time. The x-axis shows the number of access points removed, and the y-axis shows the fraction of all activity time contributed by the remaining nodes. Interestingly, we do not find a heavy tail to the curve, indicating that all nodes are relatively active and contribute to useful network coverage throughout Mountain View.

### 7. Conclusion

In this paper, we studied the usage of the Google WiFi network, a freely available outdoor wireless Internet service deployed in Mountain View, California. We found that the aggregate usage of the Google WiFi network is composed of three distinct user populations, characterized by distinct traffic, mobility, and usage patterns. These patterns are characteristic of traditional wireline, wide-area, and localized wireless access networks. Modem users are static and always connected, placing the highest demand on the network. Hotspot users are concentrated in commercial and public areas, with moderate mobility. Smartphone users are numerous, with peak activity strongly correlated with commute times, and are concentrated along travel corridors, yet place very low demands on the network.
