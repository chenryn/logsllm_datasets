# Information Leakage and Privacy in Decentralized Social Networks

## C. Upper Bound on Information Leakage

We conclude our analysis by computing the upper bound on information leakage for the test configurations discussed in Section IV. Let \( \eta \) be the probability that an element in matrix \( M \) is 1, and let \( \mathbf{r} \) be a row vector in matrix \( M \). The probability of having a non-zero row vector in \( M \) can be computed as follows:

\[
\rho_1 = P(\mathbf{r} \neq \mathbf{0}) = 1 - (1 - \eta)^m
\]

This allows us to rewrite Equation (13) as:

\[
L \leq \frac{n-1}{2n} \left(1 - \rho_1\right) \binom{D(M)}{\rho_1} \binom{n - D(M)}{n - D(M)} T(D(M))
\]

For the configuration in Section IV, we have \( \eta = 0.05 \). Depending on the dataset and the number of landmarks, this leads to the F1 scores and leaked-information bounds shown in Table II.

| **Dataset** | **m** | **n** | **L** | **F1 Score** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|--------------|
| ML-100k     | 25    | 660   | 660   | 0.6690       |
| ML-100k     | 10    | 660   | 505   | 0.6602       |
| ML-100k     | 7     | 660   | 399   | 0.6567       |
| ML-100k     | 5     | 660   | 338   | 0.6480       |
| ML-100k     | 3     | 660   | 283   | 0.6360       |

The results show that using 5 and 3 landmarks allows H&S to provide good similarity scores while leaking no more than 51% and 43% of the information in the compact profiles, respectively. Although the value of \( L \) for \( m = 25 \) may seem high, it does not imply that 25 landmarks leak all the information; rather, it indicates that the bound is not tight.

## VI. Related Work

### A. Decentralized Implicit Social Networks

Decentralized social networks, particularly those based on collaborative filtering (CF), have attracted significant attention. These approaches differ in the mechanisms they use to connect users and the level of privacy they provide. Users may be connected through explicit connections, which they declare and control, or through implicit overlays. For example, PeerSoN [23] provides an explicit social network and relies on an external DHT infrastructure (e.g., OpenDHT [24]) to store user information and publications, even when users are disconnected.

H&S is based on the second type of approach, organizing users in an implicit overlay based on their similarity. This overlay can be used for item recommendations [5], query extension [8], search [22], and news propagation [2, 3]. These works exploit local neighborhoods to construct recommendations and route queries and news to relevant nodes and communities. They effectively create distributed KNN graphs [25, 5], making them closely related to top-k processing algorithms [26].

### B. Privacy Protection in Peer-to-Peer Social Networks

Privacy protection in decentralized social networks depends on the nature of the connections between users. In explicit P2P social networks, where overlay links mirror social relationships, the focus is on the integrity and confidentiality of peer-to-peer links. For instance, PeerSoN [23] uses public/private key pairs to control access to private data, while Safebook [27] extends this with a trusted identification service (TIS) and routing mechanisms combining onion-routing and real-life trusted relationships (matryoshkas) to hide a user's node ID.

In implicit overlay networks, where users interact with many unknown or untrusted peers, one solution is to inject noise into user profiles [28, 29] to distort and protect private information. However, these schemes have been shown to be weak, allowing attackers to reconstruct missing information [30, 31].

[32] proposes two-party protocols to compute the cosine similarity of a document private to one party with a corpus of documents private to the other party, without revealing any document. The most efficient protocol uses Paillier’s partially homomorphic cryptosystem to compute the cosine similarity in a privacy-preserving manner, providing strong privacy guarantees in the semi-honest (honest but curious) adversary model.

[33] describes a Private Neighbor Collaborative Filtering (PNCF) algorithm that guarantees differential privacy of neighborhoods, adapting elements of differential privacy to meet the specific requirements of CF and retain recommendation utility. Although designed for centralized settings, a decentralized version is possible.

Private Profile Matching (PPM) [34, 35, 36] and private set intersection [37] are related research domains that could serve as building blocks for decentralized KNN computation. However, existing protocols in these domains, such as homomorphic encryption, provide strong privacy at the cost of high computational complexity, making them impractical for recommendation systems. H&S strikes a balance, providing an efficient solution with reasonable privacy.

## VII. Conclusion

We have presented Hide & Share (H&S), a novel peer-to-peer similarity computation protocol for decentralized KNN computation. We have demonstrated both formally and experimentally that H&S protects user privacy in the context of a peer-to-peer recommender system while preserving effectiveness. H&S introduces landmarks, random data structures shared between peers comparing their profiles, and leverages cryptography and security mechanisms to ensure these landmarks cannot be used to attack user privacy.

Using three real-world datasets, we have shown that H&S maintains a strong level of privacy while providing recommendations close to those of an open system with no particular privacy protection. Preliminary attacks have also shown that H&S performs better than a randomization scheme. We have proposed an upper bound on the amount of information leaked by our scheme.

Although our primary focus has been on recommendation services, the applicability of H&S is not limited to this domain. Future work will investigate how H&S can be applied to other services, such as search, news propagation, and decentralized differential privacy. We also plan to improve our upper bound and further investigate H&S properties under stronger attack models, including collusion and prior knowledge of items and users.
