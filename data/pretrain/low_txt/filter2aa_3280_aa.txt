# GTVHacker: Unlocking Google TV

## Introduction
GTVHacker is a team of six skilled hackers dedicated to unlocking Google TV devices. Our primary goal is to bypass hardware and software restrictions, allowing for the use of unsigned kernels. To date, we have released multiple methods for unlocking Google TV devices and won a $500 bounty for being the first to root the platform. We believe in open and free hardware, and our current focus is on Google TV.

- **Amir Etemadieh (Zenofex)**: Research Scientist at Accuvant LABS and founder of GTVHacker

## What is Google TV?
Google TV is a platform that:
- Bridges the gap between your TV and an Android device.
- Creates an overlay on the television stream and includes an IR transmitter for media center devices (cable box, TV, sound system).
- Receives over-the-air updates automatically from OEM manufacturers.
- Contains a forked version of Chrome with all plugins and extensions disabled.
- Was initially released without the Android Market but was later updated to include it.
- Provides a built-in Flash Player, though most content providers block it.

## Why We Hack It
We targeted Google TV due to several limitations:
- Locked bootloader
- Heavily restricted kernel preventing user modifications
- Generation 1 end-of-life (EOL)
- Crippled Flash Player

In short, Google TV devices are locked down and limited by their design. Our goal is to change that.

## Last Year's Achievements
Last year, we successfully hacked all released Google TV devices. Let's quickly review the exploits!

## Generation 1 Hardware
- **Extremely limited number of devices** compared to the second generation.
- **First generation has been discontinued.**

### Devices
- Logitech Revue
- Sony NSZ-GT1
- Sony NSZ-[24-46]GT1

### Exploits
- **Logitech Revue**
  - Root UART
  - /dev/devmem (Dan Rosenberg)
- **Sony NS[X|Z]-[24-46]GT1**
  - Downgrade nodev bug
  - Recovery LCE
  - kexec as module
  - Unsigned Kernels

## Chrome Flash Player Modification
Hulu and other sites check the Flash Player version string, preventing access. By modifying the version string and browser user-agent, we bypassed content blocks on all blocked sites.

## Logitech's Secret Message
“@gtvhackers congratulations if you're reading this please post a note on your forum to let me know ;)”

## Boxee Box
- **Exploit disclosed at last year's DefCon**
  - Software LCE
  - Hardware Root UART (under some VIA's)
  - Spawned the Boxee+ Community
  - Modifications based on our root extend the life and functionality of the Boxee Box
  - 308,128 views since December 2012
  - STILL VULNERABLE :)

## The Next Generation
### Generation 2 Hardware
- **Netgear Prime**
- **Sony NSZ-GS7/GS8**
- **Hisense Pulse**
- **Vizio Co-Star**
- **Asus Cube**
- **LG 47/55G2 & G3**
- **LG U+**

### Specifications
- Marvell 88DE3100 based
- ARM – Dual 1.2GHz processors
- Dubbed the “Armada 1500”
- On-die Crypto processor, separate memory
- Secure Boot from ROM via RSA and AES

### Platform Information
- **Android 3.2**: No public vulnerabilities work
- **Not a Bionic libc**: No Android native libraries supported
- **Gen 1**: Intel CE4150 (Single Core Atom ~1.2GHz)
- **Gen 2**: Marvell Armada 1500 (Dual Core ARM ~1.2GHz each)
- **Android 4.2.2 incoming for Gen 2**: Adds Native Libraries, Bionic libc

### Device Details
- **Sony NSZ-GS7/GS8**

  - Larger form factor with internal PSU and built-in IR blasters
  - $199
- **Vizio Co-Star**
  - Small form factor
  - No Voice Search
  - Custom Launcher
  - $99 MSRP
  - Updates encrypted via Update Logic (common in all Vizio devices)
- **Hisense Pulse**
  - 2nd Best Remote
  - Launched with ADB running as root (patched shortly after)
  - $99 MSRP
- **Hisense Pulse Root**
  - Teardown showed a root shell over UART
  - ro.debuggable=1
  - adb root was all it needed!
  - Released a script that disables updates and installs our Chrome Flash Modification
- **Netgear NeoTV Prime**
  - Horrible Remote
  - $129 MSRP
  - Two exploits (one real, one oversight)
- **Netgear NeoTV Prime Root**
  - Auto-spawned a console as the root user over UART regardless of security setting
  - Factory backdoor in the “testmode” service
  - Allowed for execution of code from USB as root
- **Asus CUBE**
  - Same generation 2 hardware
  - Bad Remote
  - $139 MSRP
- **CubeRoot**
  - Auto-exploits and patches the Asus Cube from an app
  - Exploited a helper app (oplayhelper) via a world-writable socket
  - Helper application passed un-sanitized input to the mount command resulting in LCE
  - Triggered the vulnerability from within an Android APK
  - Point, click, pwn
  - Added to Google Play Store

**USB to TTL adapters will be available at the Q&A session.**
