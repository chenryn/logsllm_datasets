### Research on Attack Frameworks

#### DealersChoice
- **Named by @Unit42_Intel**
- **Used by APT28**
- **Continuous Improvement**: To avoid detection as much as possible.
- **Initial Approach**:
  - Check the current Flash version.
  - Filter geographical location.
  - Short survival time.
- **New Approach**:
  - Anti-sandbox: Simulate document slide.
  - Rewrite open-source code, add malicious features, and avoid static detection.

### Continuous Innovation

- **Sandbox Detection Engine Defects**: Develop the next generation of sandbox detection engines.
- **Environment Selection**: Create a variety of environments.
- **Delivery Strategies**: Implement strategies with a high trigger rate.
- **Real-Time Notification System**: Build a system to notify analysts in real-time.
- **Research DealersChoice Framework**: Enhance Flash-specific detection.
