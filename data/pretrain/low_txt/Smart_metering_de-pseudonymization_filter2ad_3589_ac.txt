### Consumption Trace Linkability and Re-pseudonymization

An attacker may attempt to match two datasets with different pseudonyms to determine if they originate from the same source. If the re-pseudonymization time frame is constant, the sizes of the training and test sets will be identical. The potential impact on the linking probability (LP) attack is illustrated in Figure 9.

Even with a re-pseudonymization interval of just 20 days, it is possible to link two pseudonyms of the same identity with 80% accuracy. Therefore, for re-pseudonymization to be effective, it must occur at very short intervals. There are two primary drawbacks to this approach:

1. **Limited Analysis Scope**: Analysis over frequently re-pseudonymized consumption traces can only span the intervals defined by the re-pseudonymization time frame. Long-term consumption data analysis, which is often required by contractors, becomes infeasible without additional information about the pseudonymization.
2. **Storage Overhead**: Frequent re-pseudonymization requires storing the linkage between different pseudonyms and the underlying identity, which incurs significant overhead.

### Privacy-Preserving Techniques

Another mitigation technique involves preventing the transmission and storage of consumption traces in the first place. Approaches described in [9] and [21] reduce the amount of intelligible data to one value per reporting interval. This value represents the price for the energy consumed during that day, allowing for high-resolution time-of-use or real-time pricing. It can also be used to report just one value per year, combining the benefits of low resolution and demand response tariffs.

It is important to note that the single value per reporting interval includes a weighted energy consumption based on the applicable tariff, thus containing more information than a simple low-resolution strategy. However, its use is limited to billing and cannot be used for forecasting due to the tariff's influence on the actual consumption.

#### Attacks on Smart Metering Privacy

Several studies, such as [5, 6, 11, 12, 14, 15, 20], have investigated the broad area of consumption trace analysis and behavior analysis from energy consumption. For example, [14] explores the effectiveness of their developed behavior deduction using a Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) approach. Over a two-week period, they collected electrical data and video surveillance to infer behavior events and load events, evaluating the performance of behavior analysis with control data from the video. They constructed a sample disclosure metric to categorize behavior deductions into categories like presence, sleep schedule, and others, rating the disclosure in these categories according to the system's ability. [11], on the other hand, focuses on detecting and characterizing different appliances based on load signatures.

#### Mitigation by Data Prevention

The following approaches ensure consumer privacy by not storing household-specific consumption traces at the supplier, making LP/Linkability (LA) attacks infeasible:

- **Trusted Third Party (TTP) Approach** [1]: A model for measuring privacy in smart metering is developed, and two solutions are presented: a TTP-based approach where individual consumption profiles are aggregated at the third party, and only sums are communicated to the supplier. The other approach masks consumption profiles by adding randomness with a zero mean.
- **Smart Meter with TPM** [18]: A twofold approach is presented, employing a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) in the smart meter to obtain signed tariff data from the supplier and calculate a trustworthy bill. The second solution uses the electrical grid infrastructure as a third party to anonymize up-to-date consumption values.
- **Virtualization and Trusted Computing** [13]: The authors perform an informal threat analysis of smart metering and propose an attested smart meter architecture using virtualization, mandatory network access control, and trusted computing techniques. This enables multiple applications to use the smart meter hardware in a privacy-preserving manner.
- **Cryptographic Approaches** [9, 21]: These works focus on homomorphically calculating the price locally in the household and reporting the final price and cryptographic proofs to the supplier. [21] specifically addresses how this can be integrated into existing smart meter reporting protocols.

#### Mitigation by Anonymization

In [3], the authors propose separating the data flow from the smart meter into high- and low-frequency flows. The low-frequency flow, attributed with the household's identity, is used for billing. The high-frequency flow, which reveals more about the household's habits, is transmitted anonymously. An escrow service, potentially provided by the smart meter manufacturer, authenticates the high-frequency flow to ensure its authenticity and can disclose the identity in case of abuse. However, this approach does not fully mitigate our attack vectors, as attackers can still create linkability using correlation with secondary data sources.

#### Mitigation by Hiding

[10] proposes using a "Load Signature Moderator" (LSM) and batteries to mask consumption events that represent privacy threats. The LSM detects or is notified of approaching consumption events and applies hiding, smoothing, or obfuscation algorithms to hide them from the smart meter. Batteries serve as an energy buffer, enabling load smoothing. The achieved privacy protection is measured using relative entropy, cluster classification-based similarity, and regression analysis with different battery capacities and moderation algorithms. While this approach mitigates our attack vectors, it may conflict with cost-saving consumption strategies, and the cost-benefit trade-off for consumers is questionable.

### Conclusions

We have presented two attack vectors on the unlinkability of pseudonymized smart metering consumption traces: linking by behavior anomaly and linking by behavior pattern. The first attack attempts to link a household identity to a pseudonymous consumption trace through anomaly correlation. The second attack traces the origin of a consumption trace across different pseudonyms by using patterns in electricity consumption. We demonstrated the impact of these attacks using a data analysis framework applied to real consumption traces.

Our experiments indicate that finding relevant anomalies in consumption traces for the linking by behavior anomaly is feasible and allows for the deduction of household behavior. The linking by behavior pattern attack suggests that tracking consumption traces across different pseudonyms is also feasible and can be executed accurately. We analyzed different mitigation techniques, such as lower resolution, frequent re-pseudonymization, and data prevention, and found that privacy-preserving cryptographic approaches that calculate the price in the household have the best effect on both attacks and are the most flexible with respect to high-resolution time-of-use and real-time tariffs.

We have shown that pseudonymity alone is insufficient for consumer privacy. Attackers can link pseudonymized consumption traces back to consumers or track consumers across different databases using secondary data sources. To prevent a failure of smart metering due to consumer distrust, solutions must allow legitimate calculations on consumption traces without endangering consumer privacy.

### Future Work

Future work includes investigating the practical impact of the linking by behavior anomaly attack with adequate secondary data sources for willing consumers. Another interesting question is whether individuals can be tracked across different residencies, as new apartments/houses may induce changes in consumption patterns, but personal habits and preferences might still be encoded in the consumption trace. Research could explore whether there is a consistent component in energy consumption patterns that identifies inhabitants even across different residences.
