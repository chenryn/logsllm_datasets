### Selection of Applications

To identify applications that utilize time-, location-, and SMS-related APIs, we selected a set of applications from the Google Play Store. We created three distinct sets: 5,803 applications that use time-related APIs, 4,135 applications that invoke location-related APIs, and 1,400 applications that can receive SMS messages. In total, these sets contain 9,582 unique applications, with some applications using a combination of these functionalities. These applications were chosen from a pool of 21,747 free applications obtained from a previous market crawl. The selection was unbiased and spanned various app categories, including well-known frameworks, with an average of hundreds of methods per application.

### Data Set Construction

The first two data sets were constructed by statically analyzing all crawled apps for the use of predefined Android time- and location-related APIs. The third data set included all apps that require the `android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS` permission, which is necessary for receiving and processing incoming SMS messages.

### Malicious Applications

Our dataset of malicious applications consists of 14 relevant samples. These include 11 applications prepared by a Red Team organization as part of a DARPA engagement, designed to resemble state-sponsored malware and evade automated analysis tools. Additionally, we included real-world malware samples with time-based logic bombs, SMS-based Command and Control (C&C) servers, and the RCSAndroid malware sample developed by the HackingTeam security company.

### Analysis Results

#### Time-Related Applications
In the 4,950 time-related applications, our tool identified 12,465 basic blocks with execution guarded by time-related constraints, found in 1,026 different applications. After reconstructing the minimized path predicates, TRIGGERSCOPE classified each predicate. This process detected 302 applications with at least one suspicious time-related predicate. Further control-dependency analysis reduced the number of applications to 30, and post-filter steps further narrowed it down to 10.

#### Location-Related Applications
For the 3,430 applications containing location-related APIs, TRIGGERSCOPE identified 137 applications with 869 location-related predicates. The analysis steps progressively reduced this set to 71 (suspicious checks), 23 (sensitive operations), and 8 (post-filter steps).

#### SMS-Related Applications
In the SMS domain, TRIGGERSCOPE identified 1,087 SMS-related predicates in 223 out of 1,138 applications. The analysis steps reduced this set to 89 (suspicious checks), 64 (sensitive operations), and 17 (post-filter steps).

Overall, TRIGGERSCOPE flagged 35 applications as suspicious among the apps from the Google Play Store. Table I summarizes the results, highlighting the effectiveness of the different analysis steps in reducing false positives.

### Accuracy Evaluation

We evaluated the precision of our analysis by computing the false positive rate (FPR), defined as the number of false alarms over the number of benign samples. TRIGGERSCOPE detected 35 benign applications (out of 9,313 successfully analyzed) with at least one suspicious trigger. Manual inspection confirmed that TRIGGERSCOPE correctly identified at least one interesting/suspicious trigger in each of these applications, though most behaviors were legitimate. Two applications contained backdoor-like functionality. For this evaluation, we consider all 35 applications as false positives, resulting in a FPR of 0.38%. When considering all initial applications, the FPR is 0.16%.

To assess false negatives, we manually inspected 82 discarded applications and a random subset of 20 applications without suspicious checks. No false negatives were found, though this does not definitively exclude their possibility.

### Performance

TRIGGERSCOPE's performance is suitable for scaling to thousands of real-world Android applications. We analyzed 4,950 out of 5,803 time-related applications, 3,430 out of 4,135 location-related applications, and 1,138 out of 1,400 SMS-related applications (9,313 unique samples in total). Figure 6 shows the cumulative distribution of elapsed analysis times, indicating that 90% of the applications were analyzed within 750 seconds, with an average analysis time of 219.21 seconds per application.

### Comparison with Existing Approaches

We compared TRIGGERSCOPE with existing malware analysis tools: Kirin, DroidAPIMiner, and FlowDroid. 

- **Kirin** uses permission-based rules and has a low false positive rate (6.38%) but a high false negative rate (57.14%).
- **DroidAPIMiner** uses machine learning and has no false positives but a very high false negative rate (78.57%).
- **FlowDroid** aims at detecting privacy leaks and is not designed for malware detection, resulting in a high false negative rate.

Table II and Table III summarize the accuracy and comparison results, respectively.
