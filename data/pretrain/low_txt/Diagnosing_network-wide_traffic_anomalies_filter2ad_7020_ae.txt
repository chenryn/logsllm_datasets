# Detection Rate Histograms and Analysis

## Figure 7: Detection Rate Histograms from Injecting Synthetic Spikes (Sprint-1)

### Subfigure (a): Large Injected Spike
- **Detection Rate**: 
  - 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0
- **Frequency**:
  - 120, 100, 80, 60, 40, 20, 0

### Subfigure (b): Small Injected Spike
- **Detection Rate**:
  - 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9
- **Frequency**:
  - 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0

The histograms in Figure 7 show the detection rates for synthetic spikes injected into the Sprint-1 network. The detection rate is computed over time and compared to the mean origin-destination (OD) flow rate. The results indicate that for a fixed-size anomaly, the method is more effective at detecting injections on smaller OD flows than on larger ones. This can be attributed to two factors:
1. **Variance Alignment**: Larger variance OD flows are better aligned with the subspace S, as explained in Section 5.4.
2. **Cancellation Effect**: An inserted spike can be canceled out by a large negative spike in the OD flow, an effect more likely to occur in high-variance OD flows.

Corresponding experiments for the Abilene network and for identification and quantification yield similar results. Summary results from all these experiments for both Sprint-1 and Abilene are presented in Table 3. The first two rows of the table quantify the method's ability to diagnose large injections, showing very good detection, identification, and quantification rates. The next two rows capture the method's ability to avoid false anomalies from small injected spikes. These results demonstrate that, regardless of the underlying network, OD flow, or the time of the injected spike, the subspace method can diagnose volume anomalies with high accuracy and low false alarm rates.

## Discussion

### 7.1 Computational Complexity
The subspace method operates on link measurements, imposing relatively low data collection costs. It can be used as a first-level online monitoring tool, capable of raising alarms and directing attention to specific OD flows. For online application, each new traffic measurement is processed using the matrix \( P^T P \), derived from the singular value decomposition (SVD). Previous work has shown that this matrix is reasonably stable over time, requiring SVD computation only occasionally.

The computational complexity of a complete SVD for a \( t \times m \) matrix is \( O(tm^2) \). For our 1008 Ã— 49 matrices, the computation takes less than two seconds on a 1.0 GHz Intel-based laptop. For larger datasets, methods for updating previously computed decompositions as new data arrives can be used to manage the computational demand.

### 7.2 Extensions
The current approach identifies single-flow anomalies, but it can be extended to handle multiple-flow anomalies. This can be achieved by replacing \( \theta_i \) with a matrix \( \Theta_i \) and \( f_i \) with a vector \( f_i \) to capture the intensity of the anomaly in each flow. The identification algorithms remain the same.

The subspace method can also be applied to other metrics on links, such as the number of IP flows or the average packet size, provided the \( L_2 \) norm is an appropriate measure. In [15], we extend the subspace method to diagnose anomalies in a broader variety of traffic data.

### 7.3 Alternate Basis Sets for Y
The subspace method constructs an alternate basis set for representing link measurements, making the separation of "normal" and "anomalous" conditions easier by leveraging spatial correlation. Previous approaches have used temporal correlation, such as wavelet transforms or exponential smoothing. We compare the results of extracting "normal" link behavior via frequency-domain filtering, exponential smoothing, and subspace separation. The figure shows that the subspace method outperforms the other methods in terms of high detection probability and low false alarm rate.

## Related Work

Several techniques have been proposed for detecting anomalies in traffic volume, including [1, 2, 7, 14, 21]. These methods operate on single-time series traffic and do not consider correlations across links. Our scheme, in contrast, exploits spatial correlation across links to detect network-wide anomalies and does not require detailed modeling assumptions about normal traffic behavior.

Isolating faults in networks has also been studied, with notable examples including [10] and [13]. Our approach is more systematic, relying on statistical tools and validated on data from two modern backbone networks.

## Conclusions

In this paper, we propose the subspace method for diagnosing network-wide traffic anomalies. The method uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to separate network traffic into a normal component and an anomalous component. We evaluate the method on volume anomalies, showing its effectiveness in detecting, identifying, and quantifying traffic anomalies with high detection rates and low false alarm rates. The method can be extended to other types of network-wide anomalies, and ongoing work aims to incorporate these algorithms into a toolset for network operators.
