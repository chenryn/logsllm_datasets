## The e-krona Project
- **Why Central Bank Digital Currency?**
- **Procurement Process**
- **Requirements**
- **Winning Bid**
- **Prototype Development (Phase 1, Year One)**

### Objective
- Share insights into the security challenges of building a prototype for a two-tier retail central bank digital currency.

## Detailed System Description of the Prototype

### User
- **App**
  - Security and logic:
    - PIN
    - Signing transactions
    - Encryption
  - Storage:
    - PIN
    - Private key for tokens
    - Authentication keys
    - Message keys (e.g., Firebase)

### Payment Service Provider (PSP1)
- **Business Logic**
  - Security and logic:
    - Authentication
    - Push messages (e.g., Firebase)
    - Limits
    - Back office functions
  - Storage:
    - Authentication keys
    - Payment history
    - Customer data
    - Message keys (e.g., Firebase)

### Corda Node (PSP1 and Riksbank)
- **Security and Logic**
  - Token transactions
  - Token verification
  - Wallet management
  - Issue and redeem
  - Corda network management
  - Prevent double-spends
  - Sign the transaction
- **Storage**
  - Public keys (and private keys for PSP1 and Riksbank)
  - Wallets
  - Tokens
  - Backchain
  - Certificates
  - Notary private key
  - Hashes of tokens

### Riksbank Business Logic
- **Security and Logic**
  - Interest
  - Back office functions
- **Storage**
  - Outstanding CBDC

### Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System
- **User Alias Logic**
  - Add and remove alias
  - Map alias to PSP and wallet
- **Storage**
  - Alias, PSP, and wallet

## What is Backchain?
- **Definition and Exploitation of Bad Implementation**

### Example
- **Riksbank Corda Node**
  - Issue: 1000
  - Transactions and tokens:
    - Token#: 1[0]
      - Amount: 1000
      - Owner: PSP1
      - Sign: Riksbank
      - Reference: None
      - Tx: 1
- **PSP1 Corda Node**
  - UserA withdraw: 200
  - Token#: 2[0]
    - Amount: 200
    - Owner: UserA
    - Sign: PSP1
    - Reference: 1[0]
    - Tx: 2
