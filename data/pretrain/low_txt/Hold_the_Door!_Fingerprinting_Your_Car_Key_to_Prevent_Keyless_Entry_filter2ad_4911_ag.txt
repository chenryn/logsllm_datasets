### Device Requirements for Impersonating Kurtosis Feature

To successfully impersonate the kurtosis feature of a target key fob, a device with identical components is required. However, even if two devices are designed with the same components, they will exhibit different bit times, which are represented by their peak frequencies. Consequently, if an attack attempts to impersonate the kurtosis feature using a device with identical components, it can be detected based on the discrepancy in peak frequency between the legitimate and attack signals.

### Concerns for Practicality

Although HODOR has been evaluated under various environmental conditions, some results indicate that it may not yet meet practical usage requirements. Specifically, HODOR exhibits a relatively high false positive rate (FPR) under dynamic conditions and temperature variations. Additionally, there are more extreme environments that could further degrade its accuracy. Therefore, HODOR needs further research to develop additional features and algorithms that can function reliably in such challenging conditions.

Furthermore, the total execution time for a door unlock command should be minimized. If the execution time is too long, a driver may experience a noticeable lag when attempting to unlock the doors. Thus, HODOR must be improved to reduce this latency. Future research is expected to enhance HODOR, making it more suitable for practical use.

### Scalability

While the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) feature is effective in detecting single-band relay attacks, an adversary can still impersonate it. The concept of analyzing RF signals for secure proximity and distance measurement can be extended to other modulations. However, this analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, and further research is needed to understand the characteristics of baseband signals generated by different modulations. We hypothesize that HODOR's principles may be applicable to other modulations, as the hardware characteristics of the attack device and channel conditions influence the features.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced HODOR as a sub-authentication system that complements manufacturer-installed support systems to prevent keyless entry system car theft. HODOR uses RF-fingerprinting to distinguish legitimate door unlock requests from malicious attempts. Our evaluation demonstrated that HODOR effectively detects simulated attacks while minimizing false alarms. We also identified a set of suitable features that enable HODOR to operate reliably in real-life environmental conditions, such as temperature variation, battery aging, and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. Notably, HODOR can be integrated into existing systems without any hardware modifications, requiring only the addition of a device to sample UHF-band RF signals and analyze them. This characteristic ensures that HODOR enhances security without introducing cumbersome or inconvenient processes for the user.
