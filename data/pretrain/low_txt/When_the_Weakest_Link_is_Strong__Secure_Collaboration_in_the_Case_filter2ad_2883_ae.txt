### Security Measures as an Add-On

When security measures are perceived as an add-on to existing systems, especially if organizational leaders do not emphasize their importance, users may exhibit avoidance behaviors. Similarly, if system and security experts fail to address the specific work needs and task priorities of users, the resulting systems can be fragile. Tools and protocols that do not offer multiple methods for meeting a particular security requirement (e.g., text-based communication) may drive users to rely on insecure workarounds. This aligns with previous research (e.g., [48, 55]) indicating that continuous attention to both security and primary work objectives by organizational leaders and security experts is crucial for creating and maintaining secure collaborative systems.

### Opportunities for Future Work

Although our study has identified multiple factors that may have contributed to the effective security of the Panama Papers collaboration, we cannot determine which of these factors were necessary or which combination would have been sufficient. Additionally, we cannot fully assess the importance of other potentially relevant factors, such as whether the small size of ICIJ facilitated organizational consensus on security issues.

Two key directions for future work include:
1. Conducting additional case studies of socio-technical security successes.
2. Comparing these case studies to clarify which factors are necessary and/or sufficient.

While our findings support prior work on the value of social relationships in motivating security behaviors, exploring other motivations (such as professional norms or organizational identity) may highlight additional paths towards similar types of security success.

### Limitations

The Panama Papers project provides a remarkable example of a diverse, highly-distributed group of journalists meeting the security goals of the coordinating organization. However, no system is perfectly secure, and even those that appear to meet their security goals may have been breached. In this case, a highly-motivated and/or well-resourced attacker could have potentially compromised the systems described here without the organization's awareness.

We do not claim causality, ultimate system security, or the absence of vulnerabilities. Instead, we identify factors that may have contributed to ICIJ's success in achieving their security goals: protecting the source and preserving the secrecy of the project until the desired launch date, within a complex socio-technical system.

Thus, the measures described above should not be interpreted as a guarantee of security or a recipe for success, nor as a complete technical description of the systems used. We highlighted several technical limitations and encourage readers to treat this case study as a potential starting point for incorporating other technical security best practices (e.g., mechanisms for detecting compromise or strengthening endpoint security). A detailed technical analysis of these still-evolving systems is left to future research.

Finally, because the survey instrument was designed by ICIJ, we could not control the questions asked or how they were framed. For transparency, we include the survey instrument in Appendix A.

### Related Work

To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents one of the first in-depth studies of a security success story. Due to the novelty of such a case study in the security literature, we examine related work in adjacent fields.

#### Security for Journalists and Activists

Recent studies have focused on computer security for journalists, both individually [40, 44] and organizationally [45]. These works have identified security challenges due to the fragility of journalists' relationships with their sources and the limited resources available within journalistic organizations. Like NGOs and activist groups, journalists are high-value targets for cyberattacks and surveillance (e.g., [20]). Certain nation-states monitor these groups and scan for evidence of political dissent through eavesdropping, stealing information, and unmasking anonymous users [43]. In addition to surveillance, such groups have also been targeted by malware attacks and tailored phishing attacks, as documented in several case studies [21, 39].

#### Security in Organizations

In general, when considering computer security within organizations or networks, users are often considered the "weakest link" [8], a theme common in various fields (e.g., [26, 48, 50]). Usability studies have begun to challenge this assumption, focusing on balancing security and usability (e.g., [35]). Research shows that users make decisions based on a rational concern for efficiency, leading many to deliberately ignore security advice and training [24, 25].

Scholars have found that organizational culture is critical for the successful implementation of security policies [58]. For example, Kirlappos and Sasse [37] show that social relationships between employees impact compliance with security mandates. Blythe et al. [10] identified factors contributing to employees' security behaviors, including security knowledge and perceptions of responsibility. Thomson et al. [55] highlight the importance of integrating security awareness into an organization's daily culture. Pflueger et al. [48] discuss the rollout of security mandates in the context of employees' mental workload and interaction with their primary tasks. All of these factors from prior work—peer trust relationships, organizational security culture and norms, and integration with primary tasks—are echoed in our findings.

Other fields, including managerial and behavioral studies, as well as social psychology and sensemaking, also consider the role of employee culture in general managerial compliance. Organizational culture, in particular, has been found to exert significant influence on employee behavior [16, 22, 26, 34, 41, 48, 51, 53].

#### Security on Distributed Teams

As technology has enabled geographically distributed teamwork, top-down management has given way to decentralization and flat hierarchies [14]. This change has security implications: top-down enforcement has been shown to be less effective than socially embedded, trust-based cultural compliance [37]. Moreover, top-down mandates can lead to employees' distrust of the organization [59] or harm productivity [27]. Our findings suggest that this distrust effect may be overcome by strong social relationships and respect for the organization.

For digital rather than physical collaborations, computer security becomes critically important, and knowledge management in such teams is a topic of interest for researchers [9, 11, 38, 47]. However, with some notable exceptions [14, 33], the specific requirements of such teams for security compliance are understudied. Our research helps address this gap in the literature.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we explored a security success story: the year-long Panama Papers project collaboration among hundreds of journalists worldwide. We presented and analyzed survey data from 118 journalists involved in the project, as well as interviews with the editorial and technical staff behind the design and implementation of the collaboration tools. From these datasets, we distilled success factors and recommendations for designing and implementing secure socio-technical systems.

We found that users will accept strict security requirements to use tools critical to their core (non-security) efforts; that a strategy of reducing security decisions by making secure behavior the default and providing secure alternatives for unsupported functionality may discourage insecure workarounds; that leveraging peer relationships can foster a collaborative culture with a shared sense of security responsibility; and that inviting and engaging user input helps establish a sense of reciprocity that facilitates the adoption of security mandates. This case study demonstrates not only that meeting significant security goals is possible in a complex socio-technical system but also provides valuable insights into how similarly successful future systems can be designed.
