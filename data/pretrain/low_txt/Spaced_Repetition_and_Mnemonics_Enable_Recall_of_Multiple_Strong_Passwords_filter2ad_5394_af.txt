### Exponential Rehearsal Intervals and User Study

The secret \( s \) and the base unit of time \( b \) are key components in our study. The length of the rehearsal intervals grows exponentially with the number of prior rehearsals \( i \). Our user study provides evidence that users can remember 4 PAO (Person-Action-Object) stories following a 12-hour × 1.5 rehearsal schedule, where \( b = 12 \) hours and \( \sigma_s = 1.5 \).

If a user needs to recall the secret \( s \) during a normal login within the time interval \([t_i, t_{i+1})\), we say that this rehearsal requirement was satisfied naturally. If the user does not rehearse \( s \) naturally during the interval \([t_i, t_{i+1})\), they would need to be reminded to perform an extra rehearsal to ensure they do not forget \( s \). Blocki et al. [12] suggested quantifying the usability of a password management scheme by predicting the number of extra rehearsals (XR∞) a user would need to perform over their lifetime to remember all their password-related secrets. The value of XR∞ depends on how frequently the user logs into each of their accounts, as well as the parameters \( b \) and \( \sigma \).

### Extra Rehearsal Effort

We previously observed that a user could form 14 passwords from 4 PAO stories by adopting the Shared Cues scheme of Blocki et al. [12]. Table IX predicts the number of extra rehearsals (XR∞) a user would need to perform over their lifetime to ensure they remember all 4 PAO stories. We used the parameters \( b = 12 \) hours and \( \sigma_s = 1.5 \) because most users in our study were able to remember 4 PAO stories using this schedule.

To make these predictions, we assume that we know how frequently the user visits each of their 14 accounts on average (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) and that the user's visitation schedule is well-modeled by a Poisson arrival process. We consider three types of user profiles: Active, Typical, and Infrequent.

| Number of Accounts Visited | Daily | Weekly | Monthly |
|---------------------------|-------|--------|---------|
| E[XR∞ - XR1.75]           | 5     | 2      | 0       |
| E[XR∞]                    | 5     | 8      | 2       |

**Table IX: Expected number of extra rehearsals to remember 14 passwords with 4 PAO stories, with \( b = 0.5 \) days and \( \sigma_s = 1.5 \)**

| User Type | E[XR∞] |
|-----------|--------|
| Active    | 3.29   |
| Typical   | 7.81   |
| Infrequent| 30.41  |

The predictions in Table IX indicate that Active and Typical users could maintain 14 secure passwords with minimal rehearsal effort. The table also predicts the number of extra rehearsals needed after 1.75 days (E[XR∞] - E[XR1.75]). We observe that most of the extra rehearsal effort is concentrated in the first few days. After 1.75 days, Active and Typical users would likely not need to perform any extra rehearsals over their lifetime to remember all 4 PAO stories.

### Mitigating the Interference Effect

One potential downside of the Shared Cues password management scheme [12] is that more secure versions may require users to memorize multiple stories at once. For example, Blocki et al. [12] suggested that users memorize 43 stories to create 110 unique passwords with a (43, 4, 1)-sharing set family. While this scheme provides strong security guarantees, the user would need to memorize at least 36 of these stories just to form the first 9 passwords. Our study observed an interference effect, suggesting that users find it difficult to memorize so many stories at once. This interference effect is likely due, at least partially, to user fatigue. One potential way to mitigate this effect is to have users follow a staggered schedule, memorizing two new PAO stories at a time. Further studies are needed to test this hypothesis. Another important research problem is to construct (n, ℓ, γ)-sharing set families that expand gracefully, minimizing the number of action-object pairs a user needs to memorize to form the first t passwords.
