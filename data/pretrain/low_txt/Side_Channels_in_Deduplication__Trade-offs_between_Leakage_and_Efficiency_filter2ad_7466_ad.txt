### Mathematical Formulation and Analysis

Given the equation:
\[ i = r + 2 \]

We define:
\[ i_p = \frac{p_1 \cdot r(r + 1)}{2} + (r + 1)(p_1 - \delta_r) \]
\[ i_p = \frac{(r + 1)(r + 2)}{2} p_1 - \delta_r - r\delta_r + 10 \]

Substituting into Equation 1, we get:
\[ r(r + 1)(r - 2)p_1 - r(r + 1)(r + 2)p_1 + 2r\delta_r + 2r^2\delta_r - (r + 1)(r - 2)\delta_r - 2r \]
\[ \Leftrightarrow -4r(r + 1)p_1 + (r + 1)(r + 2)\delta_r - 2r \]

Summing over \( i \) from \( r + 2 \) to \( B \):
\[ \sum_{i=r+2}^{B} i_p \leq 0 \]

Since the summation term is non-negative and \( (r + 1) > 0 \), it is sufficient to show that:
\[ 4rp_1 \geq (r + 2)\delta_r \]

Given that the strategy is non-increasing, \( p_1 \geq \delta_r \), and since \( r \in \{1, \ldots, B\} \), we have \( 4r \geq (r + 2) \). Therefore, the inequality holds.

Repeating this process until we reach \( p'_{B-1} \) will yield the uniform strategy DSU as required.

### Efficacy Metric for Deduplication Strategies

We claim that \( \Delta \cdot E \) is a natural efficacy metric for deduplication strategies, giving equal weight to bandwidth efficiency and security against the existence-of-file attack. The former is measured by the expected bandwidth cost \( E \), and the latter is measured by the upper bound \( \Delta \) on the adversary's advantage. Other metrics are possible and may be more appropriate in certain circumstances, but similar results could be obtained.

Combining Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, we present the following corollary:

**Corollary 1.** Let \( DSU = \left( \frac{1}{B}, 0, \ldots \right) \) be the uniform deduplication strategy with corresponding values \( EU \) and \( \Delta U \). For any deduplication strategy \( DS = (p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_B, 0, \ldots) \) with corresponding values \( E \) and \( \Delta \),
\[ EU \cdot \Delta U \leq E \cdot \Delta \]

### Related Work

**Lee and Choi [11]** suggest using a variable threshold by making a random choice at each upload, noting that this is equivalent to making all random choices at the start, inducing a probability distribution on the threshold. They claim their solution provides better security than Harnik et al.'s uniform random choice [8] while maintaining the same efficiency (expected number of uploads is \( \frac{B+1}{2} \)). However, their measure of security only requires the adversary to be certain about the file's upload status, which is less stringent than indistinguishability. In our stronger security model, Lee and Choi's scheme is weaker than Harnik et al.'s uniform choice.

**Shin and Kim [18]** discuss related-files attacks, where files are correlated and stored together, e.g., files in different formats. The adversary can infer the existence of a file by uploading related files. Their proposed solution involves a trusted storage gateway, which is impractical. We do not consider such attacks in our model.

**Wang et al. [20]** use a game-theoretic approach to model side-channel attacks in cross-user client-side deduplication. They consider a non-cooperative game between an adversary and the CSP, played dynamically. Their solution claims fewer uploads than Harnik et al.'s, but their results depend on a specific payoff matrix. Our results provide a fixed bound on the interaction between security and efficiency, allowing arbitrary trade-offs.

**Ács et al. [2]** examine cache privacy in Named Data Networking, proposing techniques to "randomly decide whether to mimic a cache hit or miss." Their privacy measure, (ε, δ)-probabilistic indistinguishability, is similar to \( \Delta \) in our model. Their efficiency measure, utility, relates to the number of cache hits and total file requests, unlike our measure, which does not consider file popularity.

**Memory Deduplication** merges memory pages with the same content, reducing the memory footprint. It is used in virtualization and operating systems, e.g., Windows 8.1 and later. Kernel Same-page Merging (KSM) in Linux periodically scans and merges memory pages. However, memory deduplication can provide side-channel information and cause security issues. Using randomized thresholds for memory page deduplication would create a similar trade-off between efficiency and security as in cloud storage.

### Concluding Remarks

A secure client-side deduplication scheme should defend against side-channel attacks. This paper models such attacks and analyzes solutions based on probabilistic uploads. We provide conditions for server strategies and show that the uniform distribution for probabilistic uploads is optimal for a natural measure, balancing security and bandwidth usage.
