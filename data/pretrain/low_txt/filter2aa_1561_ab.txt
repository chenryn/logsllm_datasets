### Timeline of Game Console Automation and Exploitation

#### 2012
- **Droid64 [SoulCal]**
  - Early console verification devices.
  - [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQXVgMKJEDY)

#### 2009
- **N64 [micro500]**
  - A PIC (Programmable Integrated Circuit) to press NES buttons.

#### 2013
- **SNES and Genesis Arduino Bot [GhostSonic]**
  - Streaming capable and inexpensive but with limited data rates.
- **NES/SNES Replay Device [true]**
  - Also streaming capable and inexpensive, but with limited data rates.

#### 2014
- **Nintendo R.O.B. + Board + Legos: "TASBot"**
  - A combination of the Nintendo R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy), a custom board, and LEGO bricks, creating the "TASBot."

#### 2015
- **Multireplay Device [true]**
  - Self-contained device that offers faster data rates.
- **Game Boy Player [endrift] (GBA on GameCube)**
  - TASBot used for playing games like Super Mario World and Super Mario Bros.

### TASBot's Performances
- **TASBot Plays the SNES Classic...**
  - Exploits the system via input.
  - Sends a homemade port of the NES classic as a payload.
  - Demonstrates an 8-bit game running on a 16-bit system.

### Technical Details
- **Object Attribute Memory (OAM)**
  - Specific sequences can be written in OAM by using specific objects at specific coordinates.
- **CPU Instructions**
  - Made of specific binary sequences, allowing for execution takeover.
  - Directly triggers the credits sequence via input.

### TASLink
- **TASLink**
  - Data rate of ~184 Kbps was too limiting.
  - [TASLink Website](http://taslink.org)
  - Uses a 32MHz FPGA (Papilio Pro's Spartan 6 LX) with a max poll rate of 2 Mbps.
  - [Papilio Pro Documentation](http://papilio.gadgetfactory.net/index.php?n=Papilio.PapilioPro)

### Notable Achievements
- **SGDQ 2016**
  - Played SMB1, SMB2, SMB3, and Lost Levels simultaneously.
  - [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/EHfw-BEuRO8?t=58m29s)

### Anatomy of Arbitrary Code Execution
- **Pokemon Red**
  1. Input exploit.
  2. Take over the Super GameBoy.
  3. Gain full access to the Super Nintendo.
  4. Anything is possible.

  - [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/EHfw-BEuRO8?t=1h13m50s)
  - Credits: total_, ais523
  - From boot to ending in 16 frames, with 6000 button presses per second.

### Glitches and Exploits
- **DPCM Memory and Game Controller**
  - Flood weak controller code to abuse raster interrupt and take over execution.

### Tools and Techniques
- **TAS'ers Lethal Weapon**
  - More flexible than IDA.
  - Graph view, low-level IL, and annotation support.
  - Python scripting.
  - NES support with the ability to add new mappers.

### Ethical Considerations
- **Am I Cheating?**
  - No, it's a technical challenge and visual entertainment.
  - Many others are involved in this community.

### Charity and Community
- **Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières)**
- **Prevent Cancer Foundation**
- **Games Done Quick (GDQ)**
  - Over $200k USD raised for charity.
