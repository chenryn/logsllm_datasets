When the use of PowerShell is necessary, consider restricting the PowerShell execution policy to administrators only. However, it is important to note that there are methods to bypass the PowerShell execution policy, depending on the environment's configuration. Additionally, **PowerShell Just Enough Administration (JEA)** can be used to create a sandboxed environment for administration, thereby limiting the commands that administrators and users can execute through remote PowerShell sessions.
