### New Command: AWID26 BitStream

- **Added**: `getAWIDBits()` utility function on the client side.
- **Functionality**: Translates facility code and card number into bits.
- **Card Data Storage**: Stored as an array of 12 `uint8_t`.
- **Logic**: Based on the AWID PDF, using `parityTest()` via `lfdemod.h`.
- **Hardcoded for 26-bit Wiegand**.

#### Cloning Programs
- **lf awid clone**: Programs T55x7 as specified by AWID26. Uses `getAWIDBits()` to determine the BitStream.
  - **Block 0**: Static rate/modulation configuration.
  - **Bitstream Split**: Into blocks 1-3.
  - **Command**: `CMD_T55XX_WRITE_BLOCK`
  - **Arguments**: `(data, block num, password)`

- **lf awid sim**: Calculates and displays 'lf simfsk' parameters for AWID26.
  - **Command**: `CMD_FSK_SIM_TAG`
  - **Arguments**:
    - `arg[0]`: `fcHigh<<8 + fcLow = (10<<8)+8`
    - `arg[1]`: `CLK & Invert = 50`
    - `arg[2]`: `Length = 96` (bits)
    - `d.asBytes`: BitStream (1 bit per byte)

### Antenna Construction
- **The Problem**: Traditional DIY methods involve a lot of trial and error, often resulting in suboptimal outcomes for practical attacks.
- **My Solution**: 3D Printing
  - **Advantages**: Creates forms with precise measurements easily and allows for the creation of coils that blend in.

#### Supplies
- High AWG magnet wire (e.g., 40AWG)
- Utility knife (for removing enamel from wire ends)
- Soldering iron
- Heat shrink tubing (optional)
- Inductance meter (optional)

### The Math of Tuning
- **Antenna Coil**: Acts as an inductor (L).
- **LC Circuit**: Formed by pairing the coil with a capacitor.
- **Goal**: Match the coil's inductance (L) with the capacitor at frequency (F).

\[ F = \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{CL}} \]

- **Microchip AN170**: Provides coil induction equations organized by coil shape.
- **Multilayer Rectangular Loop Coil**:
  \[ L = \frac{0.0276(CN)^2}{1.908C + 9b + 10h} \text{ (µH)} \]

### Making a Fake Badge
- **Design**: Started with D18c7db’s LF design.
- **Construction**: Used CD jewel cases cut to size.
- **Dimensions**: 70x40mm rectangular "badge-like" coil.
- **CAD Design**: Drawn and exported for 3D printing.
- **Additional Features**:
  - ID sticker for a convincing look.
  - Lanyard clip for discrete wiring.

### Winding the Coil
- **Matching Inductance**: Matched to the capacitor for resonance.
- **Calculation**:
  \[ L = \frac{1}{4\pi^2 CF^2} \]
- **Turns Calculation**:
  - Proxmark3: ~87 turns
  - RFIDler: ~57 turns
- **Guidelines**: Calculations provide a guideline due to natural variance.
- **Winding Tips**:
  - Wind more turns than needed; removing extra turns is easy.
  - Count and watch for wire getting caught on edges.

### First Antenna Attempt
- **DIY vs. Off-the-Shelf**:
  - **BADge-tenna**: $7.68 + $4.99 shipping for flexible white plastic.
  - **3D Printer Alternative**: About $4 filament cost, print costs below $1 with generic filament.
  - **Cable Management**: Hidden in a black lanyard, scavenged RCA cable for length.

### Clipwned
- **Storage Clipboard**: Great cover, blends well with room for tools.
- **Printed Spacers**: Hold the gear tight.
- **Official Sticker**: Seals the deal.
- **Authority**: Clipboards lend authority; it’s up to you to take it.

### What is Clipwned?
- **Purpose**: “Could I just grab that badge one second to make sure I’ve got your name right?”

### Clipwned Supplies
- **Amazon**: Full of "Storage Clipboards".
- **Step 1**: Find one with the depth needed (3/4” minimum, 1” is great).
- **Dimensions Check**: Ensure tools fit.
- **3D Printed Parts**: Provide guides to keep components in place.
- **Other Materials**: Tape, wood, etc., also work.

### Making Clipwned 2.0
- **Proxmark Client**: Compiles easily on many platforms.
- **libNFC**: Supports major distros.
- **RFIDler USB Serial**: Universally supported.
- **Battery Attachment**: For embedded computer power.
- **USB Connection**: Connect embedded computer to RFID tool via USB.
- **Cover Stash**: With legitimate forms or blank pages.
- **Professional Look**: Add notes, pens, etc.

### Making Fake Readers
- **Building Information Modeling (BIM)**: Models available for common building components, including access control readers.
- **Modifications**: Models are suited for modification and 3D printing.
- **Fake Reader Features**:
  - Add an antenna inside for a hostile reader.
  - Place over existing readers to relay/record badge scans.
  - Install rogue readers in unexpected places to see who scans.
  - Example: "Badge for the elevator? Cool upgrade!!!"

### Phone Case Snooper
- **NFC Payments**: Hailed for security.
- **Hidden Coil**: Possible uses include snooping on transactions, stealthy relay attacks, and Android Beam/NDEF attacks.
- **Phone Case Models**: Readily available online.
- **Cube Test File**: Includes an iPhone case.

### SD Storage
- **Logging**: Stolen IDs.

### Networking
- **Remote Control**: Automation and scriptable responses.
- **Low-profile**: Small footprint.

### More Embedded Help
- **Pairing RFIDler with Raspberry Pi**: Enables stealth and advanced attacks.

### Special Thanks
