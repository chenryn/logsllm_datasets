### Introduction

ArcSight UBA 6.10 is a big data security analytics platform built on Hadoop that utilizes Securonix machine learning-based anomaly detection techniques and threat models to detect sophisticated cyber and insider attacks. It uses Hadoop both as its distributed security analytics engine and long-term data retention engine. Hadoop nodes can be added as needed, allowing the solution to scale horizontally to support hundreds of thousands of events per second (EPS).

#### Features:
- Supports a rich variety of security data including security event logs, user identity data, access privileges, threat intelligence, asset metadata, and netflow data.
- Normalizes, indexes, and correlates security event logs, network flows, and application transactions.
- Utilizes machine learning-based anomaly detection techniques, including behavior profiling, peer group analytics, pattern analysis, and event rarity to detect advanced threats.
- Provides out-of-the-box threat and risk models for detection and prioritization of insider threat, cyber threat, and fraud.
- Risk-ranks entities involved in threats to enable an entity-centric (user or devices) approach to mitigating threats.
- Provides Spotter, a blazing-fast search feature with normalized search syntax that enables investigators to investigate today’s threats and track advanced persistent threats over long periods of time, with all data available at all times.
- Provides the Investigation Workbench to detect links across disparate data sets to enable quick investigations and hunting for cyber threats.

#### Who Should Read This Document?
The ArcSight UBA 6.10 User Guide is written for:
- Information security professionals and security analysts who need to detect and manage threats.
