## EV History
### Car Wars (1835 - 1920)
- Electric vehicles (EVs) predate internal combustion engine (ICE) autos by 50 years.
- 1899: An EV is the first to break the 100 km/h (60 mph) barrier.
- Early 1900s: EVs outsold ICE autos 10 to 1.

### The ICE Strikes Back (1910 - 2012)
- Cheap oil
- Limited and expensive electricity
- Growing rural population
- 1914: Ford chooses gas-powered autos for motorized assembly lines.
- 1930: Electric tram networks bought out and dismantled by GM and Big Oil.

### Return of the EV (1970 - 2012)
- 1970s: Air pollution concerns and OPEC embargo.
- 1990 - 2003: California Air Resources Board (CARB) mandates.
- 2008: Tesla launches.
- 2010: Nissan Leaf introduced.
- 2011: iMiEV released.

## EV Acronyms
