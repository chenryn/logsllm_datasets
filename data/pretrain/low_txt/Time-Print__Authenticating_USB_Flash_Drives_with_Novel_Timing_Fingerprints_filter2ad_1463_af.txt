#### Security Mechanisms for USB Devices
Various approaches have been developed to enhance the security of USB devices. For instance, some systems utilize a USB driver stack that can drop or allow USB packets based on a set of predefined rules. Similarly, Cinch [4] introduces a virtual machine layer between USB devices and the host machine, functioning as a firewall. Johnson et al. [32] designed a packet parser to protect the system from malformed USB packets. Tian et al. [57] proposed a unified framework to defend against malicious peripherals. Other prior works, such as USBeSafe [33] and USBlock [40], employ machine learning algorithms to analyze USB packet traffic and prevent keyboard mimicry attacks [30]. Like these approaches, Time-Print is a software-based solution aimed at enhancing USB security.

#### Conclusion
This paper introduces Time-Print, a novel timing-based fingerprinting mechanism for identifying USB mass storage devices. Time-Print generates device fingerprints by leveraging the distinctive timing differences in read operations across different devices. We have developed a prototype of Time-Print as a fully software-based solution, requiring no additional hardware and thus being compatible with all current USB mass storage devices. To evaluate the potential security benefits of Time-Print, we conducted a comprehensive assessment involving over 40 USB drives in three distinct security scenarios. Our results demonstrate that Time-Print can:
1. Identify known/unknown device models with an accuracy of over 99.5%.
2. Distinguish seen/unseen devices within the same model with 95% accuracy.
3. Classify individual devices within the same model with 98.7% accuracy.

We also examined the practicality of Time-Print, showing that it maintains high accuracy under various conditions while incurring minimal system latency.
