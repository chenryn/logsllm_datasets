### Introduction

In this study, we explore the effects of heterogeneous activation probabilities on the navigability of real networks. We consider a coefficient \( b \) that influences the activation probability of nodes, where \( b > 0 \) and \( b < 0 \) represent positive and negative correlations, respectively. The minimum and maximum activation probabilities are set to \( 10^{-3} \) and \( 1 - 10^{-3} \), respectively. For static networks, where \( a = 1 \), the values are provided in Table 1.

### Results

#### Effects of Heterogeneous Activation Probabilities

Figure 4 illustrates the impact of heterogeneous activation probabilities on the network's navigability. When \( b > 0 \), the activation probability is positively correlated with the node's degree, leading to a higher tendency for hub nodes to be active. Conversely, when \( b < 0 \), the activation probability is negatively correlated with the node's degree, resulting in lower activation probabilities for hub nodes.

For \( b > 0 \), the behavior of the network is similar to the constant activation case, as shown in the bottom row of Figure 1. This is particularly evident in the Internet, where the growth of \( s \) (a measure of navigability) is comparable to that observed for \( \alpha = 0.5 \).

In the opposite scenario, where \( b < 0 \), the navigability of the network is significantly affected. The high success rate associated with static maps is further enhanced by time-varying effects, even when the activation probability is very low. This phenomenon, which we term "ultranavigability," is characterized by a very small increase in the stretch, which grows slowly with time \( T \).

#### Temporal Dynamics and Navigability

Our findings highlight the importance of temporal dynamics in the navigability of real networks. Networks such as the Internet and the World Trade Web (WTW) exhibit extremely high navigability in their temporal maps. The high routing success in these networks can be attributed, in part, to their temporal behavior, although this has not been widely acknowledged before. The static architecture alone does not fully account for their navigability properties.

### Discussion

This work represents an initial attempt to quantify the effects of temporal dynamics on the navigability of real networks. It is increasingly recognized that networks are dynamic entities that evolve over time, with connections being established and terminated for various reasons. Our study provides insights into the role of the network's temporal dimension in navigation processes and suggests potential avenues for developing better routing strategies that exploit such dynamics.

Future research should consider more sophisticated generative models of temporal networks, incorporating bursty dynamics of links or nodes. This will help to further our understanding of how temporal changes influence network navigability.

### Methods

#### Empirical Data

We analyzed five real-world networks: ArXiv, US Commodities, Metabolic, Internet, and WTW. A brief description of each network and the source references for their data are provided below. Table 1 reports the values of different metrics for these networks. In all cases, we used the giant connected component.

- **ArXiv**: A co-authorship network of papers from the ArXiv repository, focusing on the "Disordered Systems and Neural Networks" category (cond-mat.disnn). The hyperbolic embedding comes from ref.39.
- **US Commodities**: A network representing the flows of services and goods (in USD) exchanged between industrial sectors in the United States in 2007. The hyperbolic embedding is from ref.41.
- **Metabolic**: A one-mode projection of the bipartite metabolic network of the bacterium E. coli, where two metabolites are connected if they participate in the same biochemical reaction. The data is from the BiGG database42 and reconstructed in ref.43.
- **Internet**: Connectivity data at the autonomous systems level, collected by the Archipelago project44 for June 2009, and embedded in hyperbolic space in ref.11.
- **WTW**: The world trade web, consisting of significant trade exchanges between countries, using the most recent data available (2013) and its embedding from ref.45.

#### Hyperbolic Maps

In the hyperbolic hidden metric space, each node \( i \) has coordinates \( (r_i, \theta_i) \). Embedding a network in a metric space involves constructing a map that correlates topology and geometry. The probability \( p(d) \) of a link existing between two nodes depends on their distance \( d \) in the hidden metric space, such that closely positioned nodes have a higher probability of being connected. The distance \( d_{ij} \) between nodes \( i \) and \( j \) in the hyperbolic plane is calculated using the hyperbolic law of cosines:

\[
\cosh(d_{ij}) = \cosh(r_i) \cosh(r_j) - \sinh(r_i) \sinh(r_j) \cos(\Delta \theta_{ij})
\]

Real networks can be embedded into a hyperbolic plane, reproducing relevant topological properties such as the small-world property, degree distribution, degree-degree correlations, clustering coefficient, and degree-thresholding topological self-similarity9.
