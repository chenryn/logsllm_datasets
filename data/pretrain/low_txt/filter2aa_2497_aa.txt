### Motivations Behind This Talk
- **Lack of Best Practices in Drone Defense:**
  - Companies are beginning to implement first-generation drone defense solutions.
  - Previous proof-of-concepts have already demonstrated that the threat is real.
  - There are no established best practices or proven methods for defending against drones.
  - Practical penetration testing tools are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these new drone defense deployments.
  - These tools must be cost-effective, easy to build, and user-friendly for security professionals.
