### CSU-J
**Figure 14: Time Series of All Traffic at Merit.**

In this section, we analyze the participation of NTP amplifiers in a global phenomenon. For instance, the five amplifiers identified in the Merit network were exploited to target thousands of victims, generating terabytes of data over a short period.

Overall, we identified 13,386 unique victims at Merit and 5,659 at FRGP and CSU, with 291 victims common between the two sites. We also determined the target networks and countries to which these systems belong. Table 6 provides a characterization of the top five victims at Merit and CSU. Our data clearly indicates signs of coordination in these attacks, as multiple amplifiers were frequently used to target the same victim at each site (see Figure 15). All nine CSU amplifiers were observed to attack many victims in a coordinated manner. Additionally, at Merit, more than 35 of the identified amplifiers were used in a coordinated fashion in attacks that lasted several days. Figure 13 offers a stacked-graph visualization of these victims. Interestingly, we observe a diurnal pattern in the traffic destined for the victims, suggesting a possible manual element in the attacks. Notably, the larger attacks, which used the most amplifiers, also lasted longer (e.g., see the top half of Table 6).

Given that the attack volume constitutes a significant amount of ISP traffic, we investigated whether these attacks had monetary implications. Figure 14 illustrates the aggregate NTP traffic volume at Merit, along with other types of traffic, highlighting the steep rise in NTP traffic. We estimate that the attacks resulted in over 2% additional traffic at Merit, incurring extra transit costs. Whether this would be the case for another ISP depends on the billing model used (e.g., a 95th percentile model, which Merit uses with its upstream), the aggregation window size, and the timing of the extra traffic [16].

For example, if an amplifier had a ratio of received bytes to sent bytes of at least 100, and it sent at least 10MB with a sent/received traffic ratio greater than 5, it was classified as an amplifier. BAF is the UDP payload ratio.

The volumes of traffic were relatively low. We also found a remarkable overlap in target ports between the attack traffic at Merit and the global data shown in Table 4. The ports listed in that table constitute 98.91% of the total traffic destined for the victims identified using Merit’s flow data.

The information obtained from local views confirms some of our observations from the global ONP data regarding the magnitude and occurrence of attacks. For example, the BAFs reported via traffic analysis of the local datasets (Tables 5 and 6) confirm those depicted in Figure 4b, allowing for differences due to packet headers. Additionally, FRGP data shows that servers in that network actively participated in the attacks on OVH servers described in Section 4.4. Furthermore, the remediation efforts at each site were clearly visible in the ONP datasets, increasing our confidence in the completeness of the ONP data.

- **Number of Unique Scanners: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8**

We also attempted to identify common scanning activity visible from both sites. However, we found little evidence of this in our datasets from Merit and CSU. Figure 16 shows a timeline of the limited activity from these common scanners. Although we identified 42 IP addresses in common, most of these were determined to be a result of research scanning. We speculate that true malicious scanning activity may be well-distributed in time, making the likelihood of two distinct sites observing synchronized scans relatively low. In contrast, research scanning is conducted openly and at much more aggressive rates.

Another aspect of interest is whether it is possible to estimate if scanning activity (to find amplifiers) and attack traffic (for amplifiers to reflect) are sourced from the same systems. To study this, we analyzed TTL values from the CSU dataset corresponding to both scanning activity and spoofed attacks. Surprisingly, we found that while the scanning activity appears to be largely sourced from Linux-based systems (mode TTL: 54), the attack traffic appears to originate from Windows-based systems (mode TTL: 109), possibly indicating botnet nodes.

### 8. RELATED WORK

The threat of DDoS attacks leveraging reflection has been well-known for many years (e.g., [27]), and the 2014 study by Rossow [32] is the latest and most comprehensive example of work examining the potential vectors for amplification in these reflected attacks. The Rossow paper characterized how 14 UDP protocols, including SNMP, chargen, and NTP with the monlist command, may be used for reflection/amplification DDoS attacks. For each of these protocols, broad and multifaceted passive and active measurements of a limited scale (e.g., scanning a random sample of 1M IPv4 addresses, partial crawling of P2P networks, and measurements of scanning in a medium-sized (/17) and small (/27) darknet over four weeks) were conducted. In contrast to that comprehensive examination of amplification in general, we focus specifically on the threat and actual harm caused by attacks leveraging NTP. Our measurements of this particular amplification vector are broader, over a longer timespan, and include a deep analysis of the actual attack and victim characteristics seen in the wild and at Internet-scale. At the time Rossow’s paper was written, no major attacks using NTP had been reported. Since then, NTP has become the dominant attack vector for large DDoS attacks, and our work aims to chronicle that rise, explore who was attacked and how, and show how the mitigation of the vector has impacted the threat.

As our manuscript was undergoing final preparation for publication, new work by Kührer et al. [20] was published, exploring several DDoS attack vectors and aspects. Pertinent to our work, the study examined the size of the NTP amplifier populations via global scanning, conducted a notification campaign that may have (though causality cannot be shown) sped up the remediation of monlist amplifiers, and reported on several aspects of the amplifier population over 13 weeks, starting in November 2013. The numbers reported in Internet scans for NTP amplifiers match our numbers closely, as expected. In addition, characterizations of the amplifier pool (e.g., that nearly half of the version command amplifiers are Cisco) also match our analysis. The study also examined two interesting but unrelated facets of DDoS in general: one being a TCP attack vector and the other a technique for remotely identifying networks that allow IP spoofing. Unlike the Kührer et al. study, our work digs deeper into who NTP attacks target and with what force, as well as explores other features of the attacks (e.g., attacked ports). We also bring to bear a dataset on NTP scanning from a large (≈ /8) darknet, large global traffic and attack data, and data from local ISPs impacted by these attacks.

While DDoS attacks in general and mitigation strategies in particular have seen much work, reports on large-scale measurements of DDoS attacks are few. We are not aware of any studies characterizing DDoS attacks at-scale since 2006, aside from proprietary industry reports based on commercial deployments (e.g., [31], [30]), whereas the DDoS threat landscape has evolved significantly in the ensuing years. The 2006 measurement studies examining DDoS attack activity focused on backscatter (e.g., [25]) and flow analysis (e.g., [21]). Backscatter is evident in random spoofed-source flood attacks (esp. SYN-flood), which makes it inapplicable to the specific type of attack we focus on, NTP-based reflection/amplification attacks. The relative fraction of attacks based on NTP is similar to that using SYN floods [31], though it is unclear what fraction of modern SYN floods utilize random spoofed source addresses, which are required for detection in darknets, as done by [25] and [21]. To address some of the limitations of backscatter, Mao et al. [21] argued for direct measurement of DDoS attacks (e.g., flow data), which is one of the approaches we take here.

To our knowledge, ours is also the first study to measure amplification-type DDoS attack activity via a direct global survey of records on the amplification hosts themselves. In addition, we bring to bear passive datasets with both global and local perspectives.

### 9. CONCLUSION

Using data from a variety of vantage points, we chronicle the rapid rise and steady decline of the NTP DDoS attack phenomenon. Our analyses serve to characterize the global scale of attacks, both in terms of amplifiers and victims. We confirm the value of actively monitoring darknet address space, as it can help detect attack precursors, such as large-scale scanning and probing, observed prior to the onset of the first large-scale attacks. We demonstrate that, in addition to countless hours spent by engineers worldwide to install patches and filters, these events had direct measurable costs in terms of increased bandwidth loads, as measured at example edge networks. Though this paper documents the lethal power of the largest DDoS attacks observed to date, our conclusions include a positive one. The network research and operations community worked to actively mitigate the effects of these attacks, and these efforts have had a visible impact in diminishing the vulnerable amplifier population and reducing attack traffic. There are, however, limits to the effectiveness of such remediation efforts, as the tapering of mitigation shows. Since rapid remediation is key to thwarting such attack vectors, we are interested in future work examining why some networks remediate faster than others.
