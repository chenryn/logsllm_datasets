### Challenges in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and SCADA Networks
- The demands on ICS and SCADA networks often conflict with security requirements.
- Understanding your network and data flows is crucial and does not require expert knowledge.
- Start with the basics and adapt some enterprise IT concepts for industrial use.

### Best Practices for ICS and SCADA Security
- **Build Relationships**: Foster collaboration between enterprise IT and industrial IT.
- **Network Segmentation**: Implement to control traffic flow.
- **Portable Media Control**: Manage USB and removable media usage.
- **Configuration Management**: Ensure consistent and secure configurations.
- **Disaster Recovery (DR) Planning**: Develop plans to rapidly restore services.
- **Workforce Development and Training**: Provide specialized training for ICS and SCADA security.

### Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA)
- **Overview**: Widely accepted in the ICS industry and compatible with multiple standards (ISA95, ISA99, IEC 62443).
- **Concepts**: Uses zone and conduit models, represented by Layers 0/1-5.
- **Layer Functions**:
  - Layer 2 (L2) can set and change values on L1.
  - Layer 3 (L3) can only read values from L2 and L1.
  - Control points allow for reporting.

### Protocol and Communication Issues
- **OPC (OLE for Process Control)**: Uses Microsoft DCOM and may not always communicate statefully.
- **Subverted Protocols**: MODBUS and DNP3 have been compromised.
- **Vendor Solutions**: Tofino (C1D2, DIN rail mount) and Palo Alto (rack mount only).

### Security Controls
- **USB and Removable Media Control**: Restrict and manage access.
- **Anti-virus/Anti-malware**: Deploy and maintain.
- **Application Whitelisting**: Use to prevent unauthorized applications.
- **Patch Management**: Regularly update EWS and servers, though ICS cannot patch as frequently as corporate IT.
- **Directory Services**: Dependent on Active Directory (AD), but consider building your own.

### Remote Support and Maintenance
- **Risks**: Breaches have occurred (e.g., Telvent, Target).
- **Vendor Recommendations**: Often lacking; build your own security architecture.
- **Incident Response**: Requires centralized logging and traffic analysis. Tools like Logstash, Elasticsearch, and Cacti are useful.

### Configuration Management and DR
- **Specialized Software**: MDT AutoSave and Siemens TeamCenter.
- **Training and Certifications**: SANS/GIAC, Idaho National Laboratory (INL), and third-party training.
- **Business Impact Analysis**: Maintain updated lists of vital assets and personnel.
- **DR Considerations**: Having equipment spares on site is not enough; plan for rapid service restoration.
