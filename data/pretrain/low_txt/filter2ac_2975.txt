**ATT&CK ID:** T1039  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Data from Network Shared Drive

Adversaries may search network shares on compromised systems to locate and collect sensitive files. These files can be gathered from remote systems via shared network drives, such as host-shared directories or network file servers, which are accessible from the compromised system. This data collection often occurs before the exfiltration phase. Adversaries may use interactive command shells and common command-line utilities, such as those available in `cmd`, to gather and transfer the information.
