### Time Difference in Blacklisting and Detection

The time difference between the moment a source is blacklisted by an IDS and the moment it was first detected by any collaborator is a key metric. The plots are limited to sources detected by more than one IDS, as localized sources require the same detection time under all four schemes. Malicious sources on the x-axis are sorted based on their detection time by Local Detection. For this figure, we set the Blacklisting Threshold to 1000 packets, rather than 1000 packets/day, ensuring that each approach will eventually detect the malicious source.

### Figure 12: Comparison of Blacklisting Times

- **CBC (Correlated Blacklisting Collaboration)**
- **Local Detection**
- **Random Collaboration**
- **Collaboration with All IDSs**

**Malicious Source IP Addresses:**
- **0**
- **2000**
- **4000**
- **6000**
- **8000**
- **10000**
- **12000**
- **14000**
- **16000**

**Detection Time (in minutes):**
- **100000**
- **10000**
- **1000**
- **100**
- **10**
- **1**

**Observations:**
- For fast sources detected locally within 5 minutes, there is no significant difference among the four schemes. These sources account for nearly 25% of all classified common attackers.
- For slower sources, the curves diverge. Random collaboration offers no benefit, with blacklisting times similar to Local Detection, except for a few sources.
- CBC accelerates detection for about 75% of the studied sources, performing nearly as well as collaborating with all IDSs.
- A small number (around 5%) of slower sources take longer to detect in CBC due to correlation across IDSs not belonging to the same correlation group.

### Overhead Analysis

Compared to Local Detection, the speedup in detecting malicious sources comes at the cost of increased communication among collaborators. 

- **CBC and Random Collaboration:**
  - Average query rate: ~1.3 queries/minute/IDS
  - Standard deviation: 2.9

- **Collaborating with All IDSs:**
  - Average query overhead: 454.9 queries/minute/IDS
  - This is two orders of magnitude higher than CBC.

### Effectiveness

Faster detection of malicious sources significantly reduces alert volume. Table 3 summarizes the average reduction in alert volume under different schemes:

| Scheme | Alert Volume Reduction | Missed Sources |
|--------|------------------------|----------------|
| CBC    | 73.44%                 | 5.02%          |
| Local Detection | 35.48%             | 38.65%         |
| Random Collaboration | 37.77%           | 36.69%         |
| Collaboration with All IDSs | 80.56%       | 0%             |

- **CBC** reduces alert volume by 73.44%, close to the 80.56% achieved by collaborating with all IDSs.
- **Local Detection** reduces alert volume by only 35.48%.
- **Random Collaboration** shows marginal improvement over Local Detection, reducing alert volume by 37.77%.

CBC also misses only 5.02% of malicious sources, compared to 38.65% for Local Detection and 36.69% for Random Collaboration. This demonstrates the significant improvement in CBC and the negligible difference between CBC and collaborating with all IDSs.

### Related Work

Several proposals exist for building collaborative and distributed intrusion detection systems, but none have studied attack correlation. Our work extends these proposals by introducing a mechanism for selecting collaborators, maximizing the benefits of collaboration while limiting overhead.

- **Early Distributed IDSs:**
  - Collect audit data from distributed components but analyze centrally (e.g., DIDS, ISM, NADIR, NSTAT, ASAX).
  - Recent systems focus on scalability (e.g., EMERALD, GrIDS, AAFID, CSM).

- **Collaborative Systems:**
  - **Collaborative Intrusion Detection System:** Dynamic groups of nodes exchange information, limiting scalability.
  - **COSSACK:** Focuses on alarm propagation.
  - **DOMINO:** Relies on a hierarchy of nodes with different trust levels.

- **Attack Measurements & Analysis:**
  - Studies on global characteristics of intrusions and Internet background radiation (e.g., Yegneswaran et al.).
  - Network telescopes for DoS activity (e.g., Cooke et al.).
  - Placement of blackholes for global threat detection (e.g., Cooke et al.).

- **Analysis of Intrusion Alerts:**
  - **GrIDS:** Analyzes TCP/IP network activities using activity graphs.
  - **Alert Correlation:** Methods for correlating alerts from different IDSs (e.g., Krugel et al.).
  - **Privacy-Preserving Sharing:** Techniques for sharing alerts while preserving privacy (e.g., Lincoln et al.).

### Concluding Remarks

Our study is the first wide-scale analysis of attack correlation in the Internet, focusing on attacks that share the source IP but occur at different networks. Our dataset, comprising alert logs from 1700 IDSs, shows that correlated attacks are prevalent, with 20% of all attacking sources being shared and responsible for 40% of all alerts. Shared attackers target different networks within a few minutes, highlighting the advantage of real-time collaboration.

- **Correlation Groups:**
  - 1700 IDSs can be grouped into small correlation groups of 4-6 IDSs.
  - Two IDSs in the same group share highly correlated attacks.
  - Correlation groups are stable and persist for months.
  - Similarity in software and services running on protected networks causes attack correlation.

- **Implications for Collaborative Intrusion Detection:**
  - Picking the right collaborators is crucial.
  - Real-time alert exchange with thousands of IDSs is impractical due to overhead and lack of trust.
  - Randomly picking a smaller, fixed set of collaborators offers little benefit beyond local detection.
  - Collaborating with 4-6 IDSs in one’s correlation group has almost the same utility as collaborating with all 1700 IDSs, with 350 times less overhead.

Future research should investigate the evolution of attack correlation and the continuous existence of correlation groups.
