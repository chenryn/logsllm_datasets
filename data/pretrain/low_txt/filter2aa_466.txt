### Copyright Infringement & Lynn
- **ISS Slides**
- **Cisco Code**
- **Copyright Infringement:**
  - Protects software.
  - The owner retains exclusive rights even when copies are given away or sold.
  - Rights include:
    - Reproduction
    - Preparation of derivative works
    - Distribution of copies
    - Public performance
    - Public display

- **Program Modifications:**
  - Owners of a copy of a computer program can reproduce or adapt it if necessary for use with a machine (17 U.S.C. ยง 117).

- **Reverse Engineering:**
  - Protected under Fair Use, which considers:
    - Purpose and character of the use
    - Nature of the copyrighted work
    - Amount and substantiality of the portion used
    - Effect on the potential market or value of the work
  - Intermediate copies made during reverse engineering are considered fair use if required to access function and ideas.
  - Reverse engineering does not protect against copyright infringement if the software is not legitimately obtained or if copyrighted code is used in the final product.

- **Lynn Case:**
  - Ensure the program is legally obtained.
  - Make intermediary copies as needed to understand the program.
  - Do not use copyrighted code in the final product.
  - Do not steal the copy of the software being reverse engineered.

### Vulnerability Discovery and Reverse Engineering
- Generally legal, but subject to:
  - Copyright law
  - Contract law
  - Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
- Reverse engineering is usually fair use under copyright law.
- Can be limited by licenses, EULAs, non-disclosure agreements, and trade secret laws.

### DMCA Anti-Circumvention Provisions
- Prohibits cracking Technological Protection Measures (TPMs) that control access to copyrighted works.
- Broad prohibition, but never upheld by a court.
- Some narrow exceptions for reverse engineering, encryption, and security research.

### Misappropriation of Trade Secrets
- A trade secret is information that:
  - Derives economic value from not being generally known.
  - Is subject to reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy.
- Misappropriation includes acquisition by improper means or unauthorized disclosure.
- Improper means include theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach of duty, or espionage.
- Reverse engineering or independent derivation alone is not considered improper means.

### EULA and NDA Enforceability
- Can they prevent a researcher from raising a fair use defense?
- Can they prevent a researcher from claiming fair and legitimate discovery in response to a trade secret misappropriation claim?
- Can they subject a researcher to a breach of contract claim for reverse engineering?

- **Notable Cases:**
  - Bowers v. Baystate
  - Blizzard v. BnetD
  - Combs v. PayPal

### Patent Infringement
- Occurs when one makes, uses, sells, or offers for sale an invention described by the patent's claims without authorization.
- If a reader operates identically to the card readers described in HID's patents, the company's legal threat has some theoretical basis.
- Only actual, not statutory, damages apply.

### Intellectual Weapons
- Website no longer exists.
- Raises questions about the intersection between computer security and intellectual property rights.

### Vulnerability Reporting and Free Speech
- **Free Speech Protections and Code:**
  - First Amendment
  - Functional Code/Actions vs. Speech
- **Criminal Speech and Crime-Facilitating Speech:**
  - US v. McDanel case
  - Conspiracy law
  - Aiding and abetting
