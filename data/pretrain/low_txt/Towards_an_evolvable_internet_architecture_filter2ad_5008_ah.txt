**Group G Transmits Data Packets to Points of DRs for Tunneling**

Group G transmits a data packet to the Points of Delivery Routers (DRs) to handle packets tunneled to and from Rendezvous Point 5. The DR sets up state (G, S, Rn). In practice, the direction and method of redirection are not addressed in [1]. According to [RFC2326], support for encapsulation is already required, and the receiving entity must know how to decapsulate the packet. However, as described, the DR has no knowledge of the membership of G. It is important to note that this state is stored at S's DR and not at S itself.

**Conflict Between User Choice and ISP Control**

The conflict between user choice and ISP control, reminiscent of Clark's trace, is discussed in detail in Section 2. Many of the architectural themes running through this paper can be traced back to the general discussions on Internet architecture, such as the "tussles" in cyberspace [52] and the need to take explicit, architected action to preserve the ability to change, evolve, and advance network technology [53]. Whether our proposal represents the right embodiment of these discussions is debatable. We look forward to future debates and present this paper as a concrete starting point for further discussions.

**Technical Framework for Evolvability**

The technical framework for evolvability, described in Section 3.1, consists of two main components: the use of anycast-based redirection and the construction and routing over multi-provider virtual networks. RFC 1546 [28] first proposed the concept of an anycast service but did not address its implementation. Some of our proposals for anycast routing are inspired by, but differ from, GIA [31], a proposal for scalable IP anycast by Katabi et al. Ballani et al. [54] propose PIAS, a proxy-based approach to deploying a global anycast service. While using a service like PIAS is a possibility we intend to explore, we chose not to do so immediately due to the current lack of deployment and the unclear control mechanisms for ISPs.

**vN-Bones and Related Work**

Most relevant to our discussion on vN-Bones is the work on testbeds such as the MBone and XBone [25, 26, 55]. Our proposal for vN-Bones is similar in spirit but differs in automating much of the topology and route construction. Also relevant is the extensive work on overlay networks [18, 20, 21, 56, 57]. While we leverage many of their ideas, vN-Bones differ in two key aspects: (1) they are deployed and operated by multiple ISPs acting in concert, and (2) they operate at the router-level path between two end hosts in a manner that is transparent to the end hosts. These differences lead to distinct needs and solutions for routing on the virtual network.

**Mechanisms for IPv6 Deployment**

Not surprisingly, mechanisms similar to those discussed in this paper can be found in the vast body of work on assisting the deployment of IPv6 [34, 58-60]. Our contribution lies in relating such mechanisms to the question of incentives (specifically universal access) and unifying them into a cohesive and general plan for the deployment of future IPvN.

**Active Networks and Innovation**

Finally, it would be incomplete without paying tribute to the vision of active networks [15], whose authors were probably the first to tackle the need to enable innovation within the network infrastructure. However, our approaches are diametrically opposite. Active networks advocate new services being loaded into the infrastructure on demand and allow end hosts to define these new services. Instead, we rely on ISPs to deploy new IP functionality and limit end hosts to choosing between ISP offerings, a more limited and tractable approach to supporting innovation in the network infrastructure.

**Discussion**

The inability to evolve IP, which lies at the core of the Internet architecture, has long vexed the research community. Overlays, by either circumventing or undermining the control of ISPs, offer one solution to evolving today’s architecture. This paper explores an alternate approach. Rather than achieving evolution by overhauling the administrative and operational structure of today’s Internet, we look for what is missing from today’s architecture that would make evolution by its incumbent operators economically desirable and technically feasible. A difference, in some sense, between evolving a network and architecting a network for evolvability.

We set out on our exploration fully expecting to discover that achieving evolvability would require a dramatic re-architecting of today’s network, rendering our study into a mostly academic thought exercise. Instead, we found that our current architecture is largely evolvable as is. The one missing piece in the puzzle is widespread support for a global IP anycast service. This is good news because global support for anycast need not be a pipe dream; on the contrary, deployment of anycast is well within reach even today.

Thus, we leave this paper with one concrete proposal for action – that it is worth resurrecting the case for a global IP anycast service. While our proposed plan for evolvability does not strictly require global deployment of anycast, it would certainly be assisted by such deployment. Anycast has been proposed and discussed in the past but has never achieved significant momentum in terms of global deployment or wide-area evaluation. This was partly because its target usage was fairly narrow (DNS configuration, server selection, RP location) and partly because, often, similar functionality could be achieved through equivalent application-layer solutions (e.g., Akamai redirection for server selection). This paper argues that instead, IP anycast could be just the mechanism needed to evolve the Internet.

Finally, we point out that even though our discussion in this paper caters to ISPs and their retaining control over the Internet, it also lays the seeds for new entrants to enter the field as proposed in [1]. In particular, ISPs might choose to sell their willingness to route anycast to third-party Next Generation Service Providers (NGSPs) proposed in [1]. NGSPs can then deploy their boxes in various ISP domains and use our framework for evolvability to stitch these together into a single global provider of a next-generation service. Such an architecture would free NGSPs from having to deploy the client-side proxies that are otherwise needed to connect end hosts to the NGSP network.
