**19D: Metabolic Reaction Network-based Recursive Metabolite Annotation for Untargeted Metabolomics**
- **Time:** 2:35 p.m. – 2:55 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Zheng-Jiang Zhu, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China

**Abstract:**
Large-scale metabolite annotation remains a significant challenge in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics. To address this, we developed a metabolic reaction network (MRN)-based recursive algorithm called MetDNA. This method substantially expands metabolite annotations without the need for a comprehensive standard spectral library. MetDNA leverages the structural similarity between metabolites and their reaction-paired neighbors, which often share similar MS2 spectra. The algorithm initially characterizes seed metabolites using a small tandem spectral library. It then uses these experimental MS2 spectra as surrogates to annotate their reaction-paired neighbor metabolites, which are subsequently used for further recursive analysis. We demonstrate the utility and versatility of MetDNA across different LC-MS instrumentations, data acquisition methods, and biological sample types. In one experiment, MetDNA was able to annotate approximately 2,000 metabolites. This expanded annotation capability allows for quantitative assessment of not only metabolic pathways but also multi-omic studies, such as integrative analysis between metabolomics and transcriptomics.

**19E: Sparse Multi-block PLS for Selection of Related Signals in Multi-platform Metabolomics Data**
- **Time:** 2:55 p.m. – 3:10 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Timothy Ebbels, Imperial College London, United Kingdom
- **Co-Authors:** Kate Leary, Ibrahim Karaman, Goncalo Graca, David Herrington

**Abstract:**
Combining data from multiple assays is valuable for identifying unknowns in metabolomics. A key challenge is associating signals from the same unknown in different assays. While statistical correlation can be helpful, it is susceptible to noise, outliers, and artifacts. Multivariate models, on the other hand, are more robust to these interferences and have proven effective in many areas of metabolomic data modeling. Here, we evaluate sparse Multiblock PLS (sMBPLS) regression as an approach to integrate multiplatform data, with the goal of linking signals from the same molecule to aid in the identification of unknowns. We use real human serum NMR and LC-MS data from a large cohort study with multiple epidemiological outcome variables. To evaluate the approach, we electronically spike signals at realistic levels into the real data. Our results show that signals from the same metabolite can be associated with high accuracy (AUROC = 0.86 at 0.25 effect size, 10 spikes per block). We also develop a novel visualization tool to help users discover associated signals based on the sMBPLS model. Application to real outcome data indicates that the method can associate signals from the same metabolites across multiple assays, suggesting its potential for aiding the identification of unknowns and discovery of biomarkers in multiplatform metabolomic data.

**21A: Session Keynote - Understanding the Metabolic Perturbation in Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome**
- **Time:** 3:45 p.m. – 4:15 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Zeping Hu, Tsinghua University, China

**Abstract:**
Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV), is an emerging infectious disease with extensive geographical distribution and high mortality. Progressive viral replication and severe thrombocytopenia are key features of SFTSV infection and fatal outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We performed metabolomics analysis on two independent patient cohorts and revealed arginine deficiency in SFTS cases. This suggests that arginine metabolism via nitric oxide synthase and arginase is a critical pathway in SFTSV infection and consequential death. Arginine deficiency was associated with decreased intraplatelet nitric oxide (Plt-NO) concentration, platelet activation, and thrombocytopenia. An expansion of arginase-expressing granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells was observed, which was related to T cell CD3-ζ chain down-regulation and impaired virus clearance. Comprehensive measurement of arginine bioavailability, using the global arginine bioavailability ratio, showed it to be a good prognostic marker for predicting fatal outcomes in early infection. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that arginine administration correlated with enhanced Plt-NO concentration, suppressed platelet activation, elevated CD3-ζ chain expression, and accelerated virus clearance and thrombocytopenia recovery. Our findings reveal the role of the arginine catabolism pathway in regulating platelet homeostasis and T cell function after SFTSV infection, providing a functional mechanism for SFTS pathogenesis and offering a potential therapeutic option.

**21B: Hijacking of Host Cellular Function by Opportunistic Pathogens During Intracellular Infections**

**Abstract:**
Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections and a major human pathogen worldwide. As a facultative intracellular pathogen, S. aureus can invade both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells. The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), has made treating S. aureus infections more challenging. There is an urgent need to find novel therapies. This study aims to identify and target host molecular pathways exploited by MRSA during intracellular infection to identify possible host-directed therapies. We employed stable-isotope labeling coupled with GC/MS and NMR-based metabolic profiling to investigate the impact of bacterial infection on host carbon metabolism. We found extensive metabolic re-routing, including a block of mitochondrial pyruvate uptake, resulting in decreased flux through the TCA cycle from glucose. These changes suggested starvation-induced autophagy in infected cells, including increased glucose uptake but lower intracellular levels, low abundance of essential amino acids, and upregulated glutaminolysis. We identified the molecular cascade activated in our infection model and showed that most autophagosomes in infected cells did not contain bacteria, suggesting that S. aureus induces autophagic flux for energy generation and nutrient scavenging. Drug-induced inhibition of AMPK, the responsible host kinase, hampered S. aureus intracellular proliferation. Our findings indicate that targeting host pathways essential for MRSA survival is a viable therapeutic strategy against this versatile pathogen.

**21C: Diagnosis of Aspergillosis Based on Metabolomics Data – Application of Relative Expression Analysis-RXA to Minimize Interindividual Metabolic Differences**
- **Time:** 4:35 p.m. – 4:50 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Joanna Godzien, Medical University of Bialystok, Clinical Research Centre, Poland

**Abstract:**
Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a serious infection affecting immunocompromised hosts. Despite available antifungal therapy, IA remains a leading cause of mortality in the ICU. To address this complex problem, we implemented a multiplatform metabolomics approach. Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from immunosuppressed patients, with and without IA, were profiled using LC/MS, GC/MS, and CE/MS. Due to the large intra-group variation caused by various medical complications, we applied a novel approach, the Top Inter-GEne Relation (TIGER) machine learning classifier, which focuses on the relative order of features rather than their raw values. This specialized evolutionary algorithm extends the concept of Relative Expression Analysis (RXA) and enables the search for complex interactions and patterns in the metabolomics data. We identified several interesting metabolic classifiers. For example, if the concentration of glutamine is higher than that of amino-caprylic, there is an 80% probability that the sample can be classified as a case. Additionally, we evaluated changes between native forms of metabolites and their epi-forms, revealing the significance of methylation processes over acetylation. Extensive data analysis of two types of biological samples and multiplatform data integration allowed us to determine metabolic differences between infected and uninfected patients, leading to the definition of a metabolic signature of predisposition to IA. This metabolic signature was supported by clinical parameters to better characterize the profile of such patients.

**21D: Alterations of Systematic Metabolism Upon Viral Infection: From Metabolite Profiling to Isotope Tracing**
- **Time:** 4:50 p.m. – 5:10 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Kristaps Klavins, CeMM - Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Austria
- **Co-Authors:** Alexander Lercher, Bettina Gürtl, Andreas Bergthaler

**Abstract:**
Viral infections cause severe perturbations in the host metabolome, often accompanied by inflammation, tissue damage, and metabolic reprogramming. In this study, we investigated changes in systematic metabolism caused by chronic viral infection. We infected mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a well-established and pathophysiologically relevant model for chronic viral infection. We performed targeted quantitative profiling of more than 180 serum metabolites, including amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and glycerophospholipids, using LC-MS/MS. We observed widespread metabolic alterations, with significant changes in urea cycle metabolites. The urea cycle is a central metabolic pathway expressed in the liver. To fully characterize infection-induced changes, we established an LC-MS-based method for quantifying all urea cycle metabolites and the closely connected tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This method confirmed previous results and provided evidence of infection-induced reprogramming of the urea cycle. To validate these findings, we performed an in vivo tracing experiment using 13C-labeled metabolites. High-resolution mass spectrometry allowed us to detect significant changes in degradation and synthesis rates of metabolites. By integrating complementary metabolomics approaches, we identified virus-induced reprogramming of the urea cycle and altered systemic metabolite levels during chronic viral infection.

**21E: Characterization of the Human Milk Lipidome Using Liquid Chromatography-Ion Mobility Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry Reveals Novel Lipids**
- **Time:** 5:10 p.m. – 5:25 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Alexandra George, The University of Western Australia, School of Molecular Sciences, Australia
- **Co-Authors:** Melvin Gay, Donna Geddes, Kevin Murray, Robert Trengove

**Abstract:**
The human milk (HM) lipidome is complex, with inter- and intra-individual variations present during the day, throughout a feed, and throughout lactation. These lipids provide over 50% of the daily infant energy requirements and contribute to immune cell metabolism and activation, as well as neural and retinal development. Although years of HM research have focused on total fatty acid composition, these fatty acids are predominantly packaged as triacylglycerides in fat globules. The positioning of fatty acids on the triacylglyceride is critical for infant absorption, making the analysis of individual fatty acids insufficient for representing the HM lipidome and its physiological relevance. Liquid chromatography–ion mobility spectroscopy–mass spectrometry (LC-IMS-MS) has demonstrated its ability to comprehensively characterize triacylglycerides in bovine milk but has not been applied to HM. To characterize the HM lipid profile, we performed untargeted LC-IMS-MS on HM samples from a longitudinal cohort. Over 200 triacylglycerides and their fatty acid arrangements were identified, many of which have not previously been identified in HM. The abundance of each triacylglyceride, such as C61H106O6 (22:0/16:0/20:4), was lower in pre-feed samples and higher in post-feed samples, typically increasing throughout the day. C61H106O6 has potent antimicrobial properties and was measured in significantly lower concentrations in the milk of mothers with infants who more frequently suffered infections. The additional orthogonal separation offered by ion mobility can more accurately profile HM lipids and provides an opportunity to fully characterize the HM lipidome and its impact on infant outcomes.

### Session 22: Environment & Toxicology
**Date:** Wednesday, June 26
**Time:** 3:45 p.m. – 5:30 p.m.

**22A: Session Keynote - Metabolomics and Toxicity Studies of Zebrafish Embryos Exposed to Environmental Contaminants**
- **Time:** 3:45 p.m. – 4:15 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Pim Leonards, Vrije Universiteit, Netherlands
- **Co-Author:** Jessica Legradi

**Abstract:**
Per- and polyfluorinated alkylated substances (PFASs) have been widely used as organic surfactants in industrial and consumer products. While these applications made PFASs very appealing, their properties make them highly persistent in the environment. In this study, we performed a chemical alternatives assessment using metabolomics between PFOA and PFOS and alternative chemicals to select environmentally friendly compounds. Zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) were chronically and acutely exposed to PFOA, PFOS, and their alternatives (PFHxS, PFBS, siloxanes D4, D5, and TMS, and GenX) at concentrations of 0.1 µM, 1 µM, and 10 µM to study the mechanisms of toxicity. No significant effects on mortality, visual developmental abnormalities, or swimming activity were observed for any of the compounds. Further investigation revealed that the transcription of the DNA damage gene was significantly up-regulated by over 2-fold in response to PFOA, PFHxS, PFOS, and GenX. Interestingly, the lipid metabolism gene was up-regulated by over 2-fold in embryos exposed to PFOS and GenX. These observations correspond well with the metabolomics data, which showed the regulation of many lipids (PC, PE, TAG, SM). Based on the results, alterations in lipid metabolism (glycerophospholipids) may be a metabolic pathway affected by both PFASs and their alternatives. GENX, as an alternative to PFOA, displayed a pattern of similar activity as the PFASs. The alternatives D4, D5, and TMS appear to have a lower impact on metabolic pathways (e.g., lipids) than PFOA.

**22B: Gestational and Post-natal Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution: A Metabolomics Approach**
- **Time:** 4:15 p.m. – 4:35 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Marina Tavares, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil

**Abstract:**
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 91% of people living in cities are exposed to air pollution levels above the recommended limits for air quality. Ambient air pollution has been associated with various acute and chronic conditions, including obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, and lung cancer. Therefore, there is a pressing interest in understanding the underlying metabolic mechanisms by which atmospheric air pollution affects human health. We used an untargeted metabolomics approach to evaluate the effects of pre- and post-natal exposure to air pollution. A cohort of 24 pregnant mice was exposed during pregnancy to either filtered air or PM2.5-enriched polluted air. Offspring were further exposed to either filtered air (n=35) or polluted air (n=39). Urine samples were collected and analyzed by HILIC-MS (zwitterionic-sulfobetaine column). Raw data were preprocessed using XCMS and statistically evaluated using uni- and multivariate approaches (SIMCA-P). Group classification clearly indicated the occurrence of metabolic alterations in mice as a result of both maternal and offspring exposure. For the mothers, 108 metabolites were putatively identified out of 137 discriminant metabolites, and many chemical classes were impacted, such as peptides, fatty acids, amines, and ketones. For the offspring, several group comparisons were possible, resulting in alterations of metabolic pathways associated with histamine and tryptophan biochemistry. A deeper evaluation of the metabolic pathways revealed by this work can greatly contribute to understanding the link between air pollution and disease development, potentially leading to new regulations and public health initiatives.

**22C: Association Between Coffee Consumption, Plasma Metabolites, and Hypertension Risk**
- **Time:** 4:35 p.m. – 4:50 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Wei Jie Seow, National University of Singapore, Singapore
- **Co-Authors:** Wenchi Pan, Deron R. Herr, Federico Torta, Chin Meng Khoo, Markus R. Wenk, Tai E. Shyong, Rob M. van Dam

**Abstract:**
Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world. While it is known that coffee drinking is associated with short-term spikes in blood pressure, the associations between coffee consumption, blood metabolites, and hypertension risk in Asian populations are still largely unknown. We used data from 3,020 participants of the population-based Singapore Prospective Study Programme (SP2) cohort. Amino acids, acylcarnitines, and lipids in pre-diagnostic blood were measured using mass spectrometry. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between coffee, metabolites, and hypertension risk, adjusting for potential confounders. Mediation analysis was used to estimate the proportion of mediated effect via the metabolites on the association between coffee consumption and hypertension risk. False discovery rate (FDR) was evaluated using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Results showed that coffee consumption was associated with a 13% higher risk of incident hypertension for each cup of coffee consumed per day (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.02-1.26, P-value = 0.024). Coffee was also associated with significant changes in the levels of 59 metabolites (FDR < 10%), including sphingolipids and acylcarnitines. Levels of three metabolites (Cer d18:1/22:0, SM d16:1/24:0, HexCer d16:1/22:0) were directly associated with hypertension risk. Part of the putative effect of coffee intake on increasing hypertension risk was estimated to be mediated via these metabolites. Conclusions: Higher coffee consumption was found to be associated with higher hypertension risk, with possible partial mediation through blood ceramides and sphingomyelin concentration.

**22D: Small Molecules and Lipids Preserved Over Thousands of Years in Mummified Humans**
- **Time:** 4:50 p.m. – 5:10 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Kevin Quinn, University of Colorado Anschutz, United States
- **Co-Authors:** Charmion Cruickshank-Quinn, Spencer Mahaffey, Roger Powell, Richard Reisdorph, Nichole Reisdorph

**Abstract:**
The mummified remains of ancient persons can provide clues about their environment, health, and death. While previous studies have focused on genetic and proteomic analyses, few have utilized untargeted metabolomics for either exploratory purposes or to gain insight into the mummification process. The goal of this study was to determine differences associated with age and mummification process. We examined tissues from four naturally preserved mummies: Oetzi the Iceman (5,300 years old), Scythian Warrior (2,400 years old), Scythian Princess (2,400 years old), and a mummy found in an apartment in Vienna, Austria (4 years old). Samples were prepared using solid phase extraction to obtain aqueous small molecules, fatty acids, neutral lipids, and phospholipids. Fractions were analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in positive and negative ionization mode with electrospray time-of-flight MS. We detected between 2,400 and 3,070 compounds in the mummified tissue samples, including oxidative stress-related compounds and bacterial/microbiome-associated metabolites. The lipid peroxidation product, 4-oxo-nonenal, was detected in all mummified samples, while urobilin (a degradation product of heme) and the antioxidant uric acid were only detected in the apartment mummy. The lipid PI(40:3) showed a pronounced decrease with time, becoming undetectable at 5,300 years. The top enriched pathways (FDR < 0.0001) were sphingolipid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Our results suggest that certain small molecules and lipids can survive for millennia following the mummification process, and that oxidation could indicate the length of mummification.

**22E: Food Preservative Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles (ZnONPs) Induce Neurobehavioral Deficits in Mice with Altered Gut Microbiome and Dysregulated Serum and Hippocampus Metabolome**
- **Time:** 5:10 p.m. – 5:25 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Chang Chen, Chongqing Medical University, China
- **Co-Authors:** Xuejun Jiang, Xia Qin, Shanshan Zhang, Yujia Zhang, Lulu Bai, Tianxiong Wang, Zhen Zou, Chengzhi Chen

**Abstract:**
Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) are widely used as food preservatives, but their impact on health has not been fully elucidated. We studied the effect of orally administered ZnONPs on the neurobehavior of mice, as well as the possible mechanisms from the perspective of gut microbiome and serum and hippocampus metabolome. Results show that mice administered ZnONPs (n = 8) at equivalent doses to human food exhibited lower numbers of cross platform, longer escape latency in the Morris water maze, and shorter total distance in the open field test compared to their counterparts (n = 8). Eight bacterial clades were downregulated, while seven were upregulated in the gut of mice in the ZnONPs group. Twenty-six differential metabolites were found in serum, and four in the hippocampus. Correlation analysis found that the differential bacterial clades had a close relationship with the differential metabolites. We conclude that oral administration of ZnONPs may cause neurobehavioral deficits in mice, which is associated with a crosstalk between altered gut microbiome and serum/hippocampus metabolome.

### Session 23: New Instrumentation
**Date:** Wednesday, June 26
**Time:** 3:45 p.m. – 5:30 p.m.

**23A: Session Keynote - Integration of MS Imaging and LC-MS Techniques – Discovering Tissue Heterogeneity with the Accuracy and Depth of Traditional Profiling Tools**
- **Time:** 3:45 p.m. – 4:15 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Matthew Lewis, Imperial College London, United Kingdom

**Abstract:**
LC-MS, GC-MS, and NMR spectroscopy are generally considered the core analytical approaches for metabolic profiling. However, they are far from optimally applied in many cases, including the analysis of biological tissues and high-throughput analysis. At Imperial College London, we are advancing the integration of metabolic profiling approaches to realize the broader potential of technology-driven translational medicine. Although metabolic imaging by mass spectrometry is a sensible approach for analyzing highly heterogeneous tissues, it suffers from poor sensitivity and a lack of ion structure information such as MS/MS or collisional cross-section. Combining MSI with LC-MS can potentially solve these problems and serve as a core for the integration of clinical chemistry and histopathology. Our approach utilizes serial sections, where one section is subjected to metabolic imaging by desorption electrospray ionization (DESI). The MSI data is analyzed by supervised multivariate methods to identify histologically homogeneous segments, and the tumor part is segmented further using an unsupervised approach. The positions of discrete sub-histological phenotypic segments are registered on the following sections and dissected using laser capture microdissection. The resulting samples are extracted and subjected to LC-MS-based metabolic profiling. This approach allows us to perform traditional metabolite identification, spatially resolved quantification, and detection of low-abundance species in tissues. Furthermore, it allows the broader integration of other systems biology tools (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) with histology.
