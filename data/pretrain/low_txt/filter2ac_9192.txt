**Title: Hey, You, Get off My Private Data: Do Apps Respect Your Privacy as They Claim?**

In recent years, numerous major companies have faced penalties from regulators and lawmakers due to violations of personal data privacy. Some of these violations may stem from misunderstandings or a lack of awareness regarding data protection laws.

In this presentation, we will discuss our comprehensive study on multinational data protection regulations and the compliance assessment of a large number of apps. Our focus will be on whether these apps provide users with adequate control over their personal data, specifically addressing the rights to be informed, to give consent, to be erased and forgotten, and to achieve data portability.

We have developed a framework to evaluate the compliance of Android apps with data protection regulations. This framework is being made available as an open-source, automated tool for app developers to assess their own applications. We applied this framework to the top 1,000 apps in the Google Play Store and other alternative app stores, and found that privacy violations are widespread.

Our findings and recommendations aim to raise awareness among app manufacturers and other stakeholders about the importance of adhering to data protection regulations.
