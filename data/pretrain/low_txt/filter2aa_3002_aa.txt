**OPINION**

CALLAHAN, Circuit Judge:

Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. ("Blizzard") is the creator of World of Warcraft ("WoW"), a popular multiplayer online role-playing game in which players interact in a virtual world while advancing through the game’s 70 levels. MDY Industries, LLC, and its sole member, Michael Donnelly ("Donnelly") (collectively referred to as "MDY"), developed and sold Glider, a software program that automatically plays the early levels of WoW for players.

MDY initiated this action seeking a declaratory judgment to establish that its Glider sales do not infringe Blizzard’s copyright or other rights. Blizzard asserted counterclaims under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), 17 U.S.C. § 1201 et seq., and for tortious interference with contract under Arizona law. The district court found MDY and Donnelly liable for secondary copyright infringement, violations of DMCA §§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1), and tortious interference with contract. We reverse the district court's decision except as to MDY’s liability for violation of DMCA § 1201(a)(2) and remand for trial on Blizzard’s claim for tortious interference with contract.

**I. Background**

**A. World of Warcraft**

In November 2004, Blizzard launched WoW, a "massively multiplayer online role-playing game" where players interact in a virtual world. WoW has over ten million subscribers, with approximately two and a half million in North America. The WoW software consists of two components: (1) the game client software installed on the player's computer, and (2) the game server software, which the player accesses on a subscription basis by connecting to WoW’s online servers. WoW does not offer single-player or offline modes.

Players in WoW assume the roles of various characters, such as humans, elves, and dwarves. The primary objective is to advance the character through the game’s 70 levels by completing quests and engaging in battles with monsters. As players progress, their characters collect rewards, including in-game currency, weapons, and armor. WoW’s virtual world has its own economy, where characters use virtual currency to buy and sell items directly from each other, through vendors, or using auction houses. Players can also use WoW’s chat capabilities to interact with others.

**B. Blizzard’s Use Agreements**

Each WoW player must read and accept Blizzard’s End User License Agreement ("EULA") and Terms of Use ("ToU") on multiple occasions. The EULA pertains to the game client, so a player agrees to it both before installing the game client and upon first running it. The ToU pertains to the online service, so a player agrees to it both when creating an account and upon first connecting to the online service. Players who do not accept both the EULA and the ToU may return the game client for a refund.

**C. Development of Glider and Warden**

Donnelly, a WoW player and software programmer, developed Glider, a software "bot" (short for robot) that automates play of WoW’s early levels, for his personal use in March 2005. A user does not need to be at the computer while Glider is running. According to the Frequently Asked Questions ("FAQ") on MDY’s website for Glider:

"Glider . . . moves the mouse around and pushes keys on the keyboard. You tell it about your character, where you want to kill things, and when you want to kill. Then it kills for you, automatically. You can do something else, like eat dinner or go to a movie, and when you return, you’ll have a lot more experience and loot."

Glider does not alter or copy WoW’s game client software, does not allow a player to avoid paying monthly subscription dues to Blizzard, and has no commercial use independent of WoW. Initially, Glider was not designed to avoid detection by Blizzard.

The parties dispute Glider’s impact on the WoW experience. Blizzard contends that Glider disrupts WoW’s environment for non-Glider players by enabling Glider users to advance quickly and unfairly through the game and to amass additional game assets. MDY argues that Glider has a minimal effect on non-Glider players, enhances the WoW experience for Glider users, and facilitates disabled players’ access to WoW by auto-playing the game for them.

In summer 2005, Donnelly began selling Glider through MDY’s website for fifteen to twenty-five dollars per license. Before marketing Glider, Donnelly reviewed Blizzard’s EULA and client-server manipulation policy and concluded that Blizzard had not prohibited bots in those documents.

In September 2005, Blizzard introduced Warden, a technology designed to prevent players from using unauthorized third-party software, including bots, from connecting to WoW’s servers. Warden could detect Glider, and Blizzard immediately used Warden to ban most Glider users. MDY responded by modifying Glider to avoid detection and promoting its new anti-detection features on its website’s FAQ. It added a subscription service, Glider Elite, which offered "additional protection from game detection software" for five dollars a month.

By late 2005, MDY was aware that Blizzard was prohibiting bots. MDY modified its website to indicate that using Glider violated Blizzard’s ToU. In November 2005, Donnelly wrote in an email interview, "Avoiding detection is rather exciting, to be sure. Since Blizzard does not want bots running at all, it’s a violation to use them." Following MDY’s anti-detection modifications, Warden only occasionally detected Glider. As of September 2008, MDY had gross revenues of $3.5 million based on 120,000 Glider license sales.

**D. Financial and Practical Impact of Glider**

Blizzard claims that from December 2004 to March 2008, it received 465,000 complaints about WoW bots, several thousand of which named Glider. Blizzard spends $940,000 annually to respond to these complaints, and the parties have stipulated that Glider is the principal bot used by WoW players. Blizzard introduced evidence that it may have lost monthly subscription fees from Glider users, who were able to reach WoW’s highest levels in fewer weeks than players playing manually. Donnelly acknowledged in a November 2005 email that MDY’s business strategy was to make Blizzard’s anti-bot detection attempts financially prohibitive:

"The trick here is that Blizzard has a finite amount of development and test resources, so we want to make it bad business to spend that much time altering their detection code to find Glider, since Glider’s negative effect on the game is debatable . . . . [W]e attack th[is] weakness and try to make it a bad idea or make their changes very risky, since they don’t want to risk banning or crashing innocent customers."

**E. Pre-Litigation Contact Between MDY and Blizzard**

In August 2006, Blizzard sent MDY a cease-and-desist letter alleging that MDY’s website hosted WoW screenshots and a Glider install file, which infringed Blizzard’s copyrights. Donnelly removed the screenshots and requested Blizzard to clarify why the install file was infringing, but Blizzard did not respond. In October 2006, Blizzard’s counsel visited Donnelly’s home, threatening suit unless MDY immediately ceased selling Glider and remitted all profits to Blizzard. MDY immediately commenced this action.

**II. Procedural History**

On December 1, 2006, MDY filed an amended complaint seeking a declaration that Glider does not infringe Blizzard’s copyright or other rights. In February 2007, Blizzard filed counterclaims and third-party claims against MDY and Donnelly for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement, violation of DMCA §§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1), and tortious interference with contract.

In July 2008, the district court granted Blizzard partial summary judgment, finding that MDY’s Glider sales contributorily and vicariously infringed Blizzard’s copyrights and tortiously interfered with Blizzard’s contracts. The district court also granted MDY partial summary judgment, finding that MDY did not violate DMCA § 1201(a)(2) with respect to accessing the game software’s source code.

In September 2008, the parties stipulated to entry of a $6 million judgment against MDY for the copyright infringement and tortious interference with contract claims. They further stipulated that Donnelly would be personally liable for the same amount if found personally liable at trial. After a January 2009 bench trial, the district court held MDY liable under DMCA §§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1). It also held Donnelly personally liable for MDY’s copyright infringement, DMCA violations, and tortious interference with contract.

On April 1, 2009, the district court entered judgment against MDY and Donnelly for $6.5 million, an adjusted figure to which the parties stipulated based on MDY’s DMCA liability and post-summary judgment Glider sales. The district court permanently enjoined MDY from distributing Glider. MDY’s efforts to stay injunctive relief pending appeal were unsuccessful. On April 29, 2009, MDY timely filed this appeal. On May 12, 2009, Blizzard timely cross-appealed the district court’s holding that MDY did not violate DMCA §§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1) as to the game software’s source code.

**III. Standard of Review**

We review de novo the district court’s (1) orders granting or denying summary judgment; (2) conclusions of law after a bench trial; and (3) interpretations of state law. *Padfield v. AIG Life Ins.*, 290 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir. 2002); *Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Entm’t Distrib.*, 429 F.3d 869, 879 (9th Cir. 2005); *Laws v. Sony Music Entm’t, Inc.*, 448 F.3d 1134, 1137 (9th Cir. 2006). We review the district court’s findings of fact for clear error. *Twentieth Century Fox*, 429 F.3d at 879.

**IV. Analysis**

**A. Secondary Copyright Infringement**

We first consider whether MDY committed contributory or vicarious infringement (collectively, "secondary infringement") of Blizzard’s copyright by selling Glider to WoW players. See *ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg*, 86 F.3d 1447, 1454 (7th Cir. 1996) ("A copyright is a right against the world, and anyone who violates it is an infringer.").
