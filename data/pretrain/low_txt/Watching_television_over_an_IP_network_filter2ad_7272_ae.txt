### 5.3.2 Inter-Arrival and Departure Times

Finally, we examine the inter-arrival and departure times to better understand the user dynamics. Figure 14 shows the cumulative distribution of inter-arrival and departure times for Channel A, one of the top-ranked channels. The granularity of channel changes in our trace is 1 second, and we assume that arrivals are uniformly distributed within each second.

The median inter-arrival time is 0.07 seconds, indicating that approximately 14 users join Channel A per second. Similarly, the median inter-departure time is also 0.07 seconds, suggesting that users leave and join Channel A at the same rate. However, the arrival rate varies over time, and the arrival process is not stationary throughout the day. The maximum inter-arrival time is 14 seconds, which corresponds to periods of low usage. The maximum inter-departure time is 700 seconds.

Our analysis also reveals that both the arrival and departure processes at short timescales (less than 1 millisecond) follow an exponential distribution, consistent with previous studies on live streaming servers [33, 39, 40].

### 5.4 Summary

In this section, we have explored how users find content from three different perspectives. Understanding this mechanism is crucial because any user activity related to searching for content imposes a load on the network. Surprisingly, most channel changes do not lead to sustained viewing, highlighting the potential for the network infrastructure to be overloaded by superfluous short channel surfing events. This finding has significant implications for IPTV networks, as opposed to traditional broadcast TV networks (e.g., cable and satellite TV), where all channels are delivered to end-users, and surfing activities do not create additional network load.

We have also characterized the arrival and departure patterns of individual channels, identifying time-correlated arrival and batch-like departure processes. These dynamics present significant challenges for the design of P2P-based IPTV systems, which must handle drastic changes in viewer population over short periods.

### 6. Discussion

Our observations about IPTV workloads provide valuable insights into the user and content characteristics of TV and video streaming systems. These findings offer useful guidance for the designers of existing and future video applications. For example:

- **Channel Selection Process**: Most channel changes are related to channel surfing and occur in short intervals. Assisting users in channel selection is crucial for enhancing their viewing experience. In current IPTV and Internet video systems, electronic program guides (EPGs) and metadata (such as tags and descriptions) provide users with additional information about content. It is also important to make new content quickly available during channel switching. This is particularly challenging for high-bandwidth video and TV streaming, especially in P2P distribution systems. For instance, Joost, a state-of-the-art P2P Internet TV service, takes up to 5 seconds to switch channels, while PPLive buffers for 10 to 15 seconds before playback. Infrastructure-based Telco’s IPTV systems guarantee a switching delay of less than 1 second, but even this is not considered "instantaneous" by viewers, who expect delays of 100-200 ms.

  Our results suggest that sorting channel numbers based on user-specific popularity or dynamically adjusting them according to current program popularity might reduce unnecessary channel changes. Additionally, periodic re-numbering following time-of-day trends could further enhance the user experience.

- **Popularity and Program Ratings**: Accurate measures of popularity are useful for TV viewers, content producers, and distributors. Traditional Nielsen ratings are often aggregated over long periods and delayed by a few hours to a day. With IPTV, we can obtain real-time popularity information and closely monitor its evolution. Access to such real-time data is beneficial for viewers in deciding what programs to watch.

- **Rewind and On-Demand Features**: Traditional and first-generation IPTV systems were primarily live. Now, TV is transforming into an interactive on-demand service, allowing users to rewind and watch TV at their convenience. Our findings on user arrival and departure patterns indicate that arrivals are less correlated than departures. Users often take temporary leaves during commercials and return late, missing the beginning of programs. For example, when watching a soccer game, users may miss a goal that occurs immediately after a half-time break.

  These behaviors highlight the need for supporting IPTV rewind functionalities, which have recently been offered by various operators under the name of "Past TV." Unlike DVRs, which store scenes locally, Past TV provides access to any scene regardless of whether the set-top-box was tuned to that channel. In standard IPTV architectures, all rewind loads would be directed to video servers. However, the strong group membership among users watching the same program suggests the potential for a peer-assisted IPTV rewind service, where latecomers can easily find available seed peers. In our earlier work [32], we demonstrated the efficacy of such a peer-assisted rewind service, where the video server load was reduced to 5% with P2P assistance.

### 7. Related Work

Understanding TV viewing habits traditionally relied on specialized monitoring boxes or phone surveys. Due to the difficulty of conducting large-scale surveys, monitoring was limited to a subset of the TV viewing population. A notable example is the Nielsen Media Research [5], which provides extensive statistics on TV viewing and program ratings.

Recent attention has been given to viewing behaviors in Internet streaming. Sripanidkulchai et al. [33] studied the Internet radio and video streaming workloads of 5,000 users in Akamai, the largest content distribution network. They observed diurnal traffic patterns and a Zipf-like popularity of live content, with heavy-tailed session durations. Short median session durations (less than 10 seconds) were attributed to channel surfing. Our results align with these earlier findings but are based on a specific IPTV system with a much larger user base.

There are P2P Internet video streaming systems like Joost, Zatoo, and BBC's iPlayer, which provide a TV-like viewing experience. Hei et al. [34] analyzed packet traces from PPLive, a P2P-based IPTV system, and found that peers join and leave at higher rates during peak times. They observed a periodic (every 2 hours) batch user departure pattern for a popular movie channel. We also observed batch-like departure patterns, but at smaller time scales (tens of minutes). This difference may be due to the channel switching delay in the two systems. Unlike our IPTV system, P2P-based IPTV has long startup delays ranging from tens of seconds to several minutes [34]. These long playback lags may influence user behavior, making them less likely to switch channels during commercials. Other studies have similarly analyzed the workloads and traffic characteristics of P2P-based IPTV systems [41, 42], complementing our findings. While our system is infrastructure-based, understanding both types of systems provides a comprehensive view of IPTV workloads.

In our earlier work [32], we explored the potential for peer-assisted IPTV systems.

Many previous studies have measured network properties of video-on-demand systems [16, 17, 34, 43, 44]. Cherkasova and Gupta [43] analyzed enterprise media server workloads from Hewlett-Packard Corporation; Yu et al. [16] measured a commercial video system in China, PowerInfo; and Cheng et al. [17] analyzed the workloads of their high-bandwidth P2P-based VoD system. These studies discuss the popularity distribution of videos, viewing session characteristics, and their implications for designing efficient distribution architectures. Although our paper uses similar measurement techniques, the network environment we study is different, as live IPTV viewing is not on-demand but largely influenced by the broadcaster's schedule. Our study is the first to use large-scale real traces from a commercial telco's IPTV service.

### 8. Summary and Outlook

Television has long been a dominant and pervasive mass media, and its viewing behavior has significant implications for video distribution networks and systems. With the increasing popularity of Internet services, multimedia consumption patterns may change significantly in the coming years. However, a recent report on the communications market [22] emphasizes that the average time spent watching television remains significant despite the uptake of broadband services. We expect TV to remain a crucial mass media, integrating many innovations from the Internet and mobile spaces.

In this paper, we presented the first large-scale measurement study of a telco's IPTV system. We characterized several properties of viewing sessions, channel popularity dynamics, content locality, and channel switching behaviors. Our data analysis of a live IPTV system provides valuable insights into how underlying networks and systems can better adapt to future challenges in Internet TV distribution.

There are several directions for future work. First, we aim to understand the implications of these workloads on system design. Our trace showed that over 60% of a user's channel changes are related to channel surfing. We are interested in designing a system that reduces the number of channels users need to sample before finding something of interest. Second, we plan to study individual user profiles. While our current study focuses on the behavior of an average populace, future research can classify users into different profiles based on their viewing times and preferred channels. These questions are promising in the context of IPTV recommendation systems [45]. Finally, developing a model that captures user switching behaviors and content popularity dynamics will be very useful. Designers of future streaming systems can use such realistic models to test and assess their systems.
