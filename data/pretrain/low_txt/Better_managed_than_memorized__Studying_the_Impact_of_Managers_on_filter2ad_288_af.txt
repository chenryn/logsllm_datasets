### Password Creation and Management: Insights and Future Directions

Our study revealed that users who created passwords, even through channels other than a password manager, generated both stronger and more unique passwords. However, we also found that Chrome’s auto-fill feature exacerbated the problem of password reuse. For future research, several avenues are worth exploring:

1. **Integration of Password Generators**: Investigating how different, and even novel, forms of password generators can be integrated with users’ existing strategies.
2. **Ecosystem-Specific Studies**: Applying our approach to examine the influence of password managers in other ecosystems, such as Apple's walled-garden or mobile environments.
