Yesterday, I installed the latest version of Atom and have been testing its features. While working on an unsaved file, I noticed that the soft wrap option was not enabled. I proceeded to the preferences panel, activated the soft wrap, and returned to my open (but still unsaved) file. However, the soft wrap had not been applied.

To resolve the issue, I copied the text from the original file and pasted it into a new, unsaved file, where the soft wrap function worked as expected.

I am uncertain whether this behavior also occurs with files that were already open before enabling the soft wrap. Further investigation may be needed to confirm.
