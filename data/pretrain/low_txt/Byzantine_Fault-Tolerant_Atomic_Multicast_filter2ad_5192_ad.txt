### Latency Analysis with Local and Global Messages

- **ByzCast vs. Baseline:**
  - **Local Messages:** ByzCast has significantly lower latency up to the 99.5th percentile compared to Baseline. This is due to the absence of the "convoy effect," where the slower ordering of global messages does not impact the latency of local messages.
  - **Global Messages:** Both ByzCast and Baseline have similar performance for global messages.

### Latency without Contention in WAN

- **Experiment Setup:**
  - A single client from each region multicasts local and global messages in a closed loop.
  - **Conclusions:**
    - ByzCast has latency comparable to a single group (BFT-SMaRt) for local messages.
    - For global messages, ByzCast has twice the latency due to the auxiliary group that totally orders all messages before broadcasting them to target groups.
    - Baseline protocol incurs this double ordering for every message.

### Performance with Mixed Workload in WAN

- **Experiment Setup:**
  - **Workload:** Mix of local and global messages in a proportion of 10:1.
  - **Setup:**
    - 4 target groups
    - 1 auxiliary group to order global messages
    - 40 clients per target group, equally distributed among 4 geographical regions.
  - **Results:**
    - **Throughput:** ByzCast is 2x to 3x faster than Baseline.
    - **Latency CDF:**
      - **Local Messages:** ByzCast has 2x to 4x smaller latency than Baseline.
      - **Global Messages:** Both protocols behave similarly.
      - **Convoy Effect:** ByzCast does not suffer from the convoy effect, as local latency remains stable even in the presence of global messages.

### Related Work

**ByzCast** intersects two main topics: atomic multicast and BFT protocols.

- **Atomic Multicast:**
  - Various multicast and broadcast algorithms have been proposed.
  - Many systems use "ad hoc" ordering mechanisms.
