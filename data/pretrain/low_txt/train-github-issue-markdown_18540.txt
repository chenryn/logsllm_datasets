We have implemented simple dropdown buttons using version 2.04, with the links structured as `<a>` tags, including proper quotes and `href="#"`. These buttons were functioning correctly until recently.

After upgrading to version 2.1 today, we encountered an issue where the links within any dropdown button no longer work as expected. The dropdown menu opens without a problem, but when a link is clicked, the menu closes without performing the intended action. This behavior has been observed on both Android 2.3 and iOS 5 devices.

Upon rolling back to version 2.04, the functionality was restored, and the buttons worked as they did previously. Has anyone else experienced this issue?
