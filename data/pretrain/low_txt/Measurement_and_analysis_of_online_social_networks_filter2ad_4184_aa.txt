## Abstract

Online social networking sites such as Orkut, YouTube, and Flickr are among the most popular on the Internet. Users of these platforms form a social network, which provides a powerful means of sharing, organizing, and finding content and contacts. The popularity of these sites offers an opportunity to study the characteristics of online social networks at a large scale. Understanding these networks is crucial for improving current systems and designing new applications.

This paper presents a large-scale measurement study and analysis of the structure of multiple online social networks. We examine data from four popular platforms: Flickr, YouTube, LiveJournal, and Orkut. By crawling publicly accessible user links, we obtained a substantial portion of each social network's graph, resulting in a dataset containing over 11.3 million users and 328 million links. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine multiple online social networks at such a scale.

Our results confirm the power-law, small-world, and scale-free properties of online social networks. We observe that the indegree of user nodes tends to match the outdegree, indicating a high degree of reciprocity. The networks also contain a densely connected core of high-degree nodes, which links smaller, strongly clustered groups of low-degree nodes at the periphery. Finally, we discuss the implications of these structural properties for the design of social network-based systems.

## 1. Introduction

The Internet has given rise to various types of information-sharing systems, including the Web. Recently, online social networks have gained significant popularity and are now among the most visited sites on the Web. For example, MySpace (over 190 million users), Orkut (over 62 million), LinkedIn (over 11 million), and LiveJournal (over 5.5 million) are popular platforms built on social networks.

Unlike the Web, which is largely organized around content, online social networks are centered around users. Participating users join a network, publish their profiles and content, and create links to other users with whom they associate. The resulting social network facilitates maintaining social relationships, finding users with similar interests, and locating content and knowledge contributed or endorsed by other users.

A deep understanding of the graph structure of online social networks is essential for evaluating current systems, designing future social network-based systems, and comprehending their impact on the Internet. For instance, understanding the structure of online social networks can lead to algorithms for detecting trusted or influential users, much like the study of the Web graph led to the discovery of algorithms for finding authoritative sources. Recent work has proposed using social networks to mitigate email spam, improve Internet search, and defend against Sybil attacks. However, these systems have not yet been evaluated on real social networks at scale, and little is known about how to synthesize realistic social network graphs.

In this paper, we present a large-scale (11.3 million users, 328 million links) measurement study and analysis of the structure of four popular online social networks: Flickr, YouTube, LiveJournal, and Orkut. Our data, gathered from multiple sites, allows us to identify common structural properties of online social networks. We believe this is the first study to examine multiple online social networks at scale. We obtained our data by crawling publicly accessible information on these sites, and we make the data available to the research community.

In contrast, previous studies have generally relied on proprietary data from a single large network. In addition to validating the power-law, small-world, and scale-free properties observed in offline social networks, we provide insights into online social network structures. We find a high degree of reciprocity in directed user links, leading to a strong correlation between user indegree and outdegree. This differs from content graphs like the Web, where popular pages (authorities) and pages with many references (hubs) are distinct. We also find that online social networks contain a large, strongly connected core of high-degree nodes, surrounded by many small clusters of low-degree nodes. This suggests that high-degree nodes in the core are critical for connectivity and information flow in these networks.

Our focus is on the social network users within the sites we study. Specifically, we examine the properties of the large weakly connected component (WCC) in the user graphs of four popular sites. We do not attempt to study the entire user community, information flow, workload, or evolution of online social networking sites, as these topics are beyond the scope of this paper.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides additional background on social networks and details related work. Section 3 describes our methodology for crawling these networks and its limitations. Section 4 examines the structural properties of the networks, and Section 5 discusses the implications. Finally, we conclude in Section 6.

## 2. Background and Motivation

### 2.1 Online Social Networking Sites

Online social networking sites, typically run by individual corporations (e.g., Google and Yahoo!), are accessible via the Web. To participate fully, users must register with a site, possibly under a pseudonym. Some sites allow browsing of public data without explicit sign-up. Users may volunteer information about themselves (e.g., their birthday, place of residence, or interests), which is added to their profile.

**Links:** The social network is composed of user accounts and links between users. Some sites (e.g., Flickr, LiveJournal) allow users to link to any other user without consent from the target. Other sites (e.g., Orkut, LinkedIn) require mutual consent before a link is created. Users form links for various reasons, such as being real-world or online acquaintances, sharing interests, or being interested in each other's content. Some users see the acquisition of many links as a goal in itself. User links in social networks can serve as both hyperlinks and bookmarks on the Web.

**Groups:** Most sites enable users to create and join special interest groups. Users can post messages and upload shared content to the group. Some groups are moderated, while others are unrestricted, allowing any member to join and post messages or content.

### 2.1.1 Is the Social Network Used in Locating Content?

To investigate the role of the social network in organizing and locating content, we conducted a simple measurement of how users browse the Flickr system. We analyzed HTTP requests to the flickr.com domain from a 55-day trace taken at the border routers of the Technical University of Munich between August 17th and October 11th, 2006. We found 22,215 photo views from at least 1,056 distinct users. For each view, we examined the browser's click stream to determine what action led the user to a given photo.

We found that 17,897 of the views (80.6%) resulted from following links in the Flickr user graph or were additional views within a visited user’s collection. In other words, in 80.6% of the views, the user network was involved in browsing content. Focusing on the remaining views, 1,418 (6.3%) were the result of using the Flickr photo search facilities, and 2,900 (13.1%) were the result of a link from an external source. Neither of the latter sets of views involved the social network.

Our experiment suggests that the social network in Flickr plays a crucial role in locating content. Four out of five photos were located by traversing the social network links.

### 2.2 Why Study Social Networks?

Online social networks are already central to some very popular Web sites. As the technology matures, more applications are likely to emerge. Social networking will play an important role in future personal and commercial online interactions, as well as in the location and organization of information and knowledge. Examples include browser plug-ins to discover information viewed by friends and social network-based, cooperative Web search tools. Major Web search companies are also deploying services that leverage social networks, such as Yahoo!’s MyWeb 2.0 and Google Co-op.

Below, we outline a few ways in which an understanding of the structure of online social networks can benefit the design of new systems and help us understand their impact on the future Internet. Additionally, we speculate on how our data might be of interest to researchers in other disciplines.

#### 2.2.1 Shared Interest and Trust

Adjacent users in a social network tend to trust each other. Several research systems have been proposed to exploit this trust. For example, SybilGuard uses a social network to detect Sybil attacks in distributed systems, leveraging the fact that Sybil users cannot create many trust links to non-Sybil users. Re exploits the trust between email users to aid spam classification by whitelisting messages from friends and friends-of-friends. A deeper understanding of the underlying topology is essential for the design and analysis of robust trust and reputation metrics for these systems.

Adjacent users in a social network also tend to have common interests. Users browse neighboring regions of their social network because they are likely to find content that is of interest to them. Systems such as Yahoo! My Web, Google Co-op, and PeerSpective use social networks to rank Internet search results relative to the interests of a user’s neighborhood in the social network. These systems observe content viewed and search results clicked on by members of a social network to better rank the results of the user’s future searches.

Understanding the structure of online social networks, as well as the processes that shape them, is important for these applications. Efficient algorithms to infer the actual degree of shared interest between two users or the reliability of a user (as perceived by other users) would be useful. With respect to security, it is important to understand the robustness of such networks to deliberate attempts at manipulation. These topics are beyond the scope of this paper; however, a fundamental understanding of online social network structure is likely to be a necessary first step in these directions.

#### 2.2.2 Impact on Future Internet

The social networks we study exist in the databases of online social networking sites. However, other online social networks are implemented as overlay networks. For example, the graph formed by people who exchange email, or the graph formed by Skype users who include each other in their contact lists, can be viewed as another social network on top of the Internet. If future distributed online social networks become popular and bandwidth-intensive, they could significantly impact Internet traffic, much like current peer-to-peer content distribution networks. Understanding the structure of online social networks is critical for understanding the robustness and security of distributed online social networks and their impact on the future Internet.

#### 2.2.3 Impact on Other Disciplines

Our work also has relevance beyond computer science. To social scientists, online social networks offer an unprecedented opportunity to study social networks at a large scale. Sociologists can examine our data to test existing theories about offline social networks and to look for new forms of behavior in online social networks.

Studying the structure of online social networks may help improve the understanding of online campaigning and viral marketing. Political campaigns have recognized the importance of blogs in elections, and marketing experts are experimenting with paid viral marketing to better promote products and companies. Regardless of one’s stance on these phenomena, a better understanding of the structure of social networks is likely to improve our understanding of the opportunities, limitations, and threats associated with these ideas.

## 3. Related Work

### 3.1 Social Networks

Sociologists have studied many properties of social networks. Milgram shows that the average path length between two Americans is 6 hops, and Pool and Kochen provide an analysis of the small-world effect. Granovetter argues that a social network can be partitioned into 'strong' and 'weak' ties, with strong ties being tightly clustered. For an overview of social network analysis techniques, we refer the reader to the book by Wasserman and Faust.

As online social networks gain popularity, sociologists and computer scientists are beginning to investigate their properties. Adamic et al. study an early online social network at Stanford University and find that the network exhibits small-world behavior and significant local clustering. Liben-Nowell et al. find a strong correlation between friendship and geographic location in social networks using data from LiveJournal. Kumar et al. examine two online social networks and find that both possess a large strongly connected component. Girvan and Newman observe that users in online social networks tend to form tightly knit groups. Backstrom et al. examine snapshots of group membership in LiveJournal and present models for the growth of user groups over time. We were able to verify these properties on a much larger scale.

In recent work, Ahn et al. analyze complete data from a large South Korean social networking site (Cyworld), along with data from small sample crawls of MySpace and Orkut. The authors obtained data directly from CyWorld operators, and the volume of available data allowed them to conduct an in-depth study of that site using some of the same metrics that we use in this paper. The comparison with different networks is limited by the small crawled data samples of MySpace and Orkut. Our study is largely complementary: the data available to us for any one site is less detailed, but we are able to compare large crawled data sets from multiple sites.

### 3.2 Information Networks

A long thread of research examines the structure of complex networks like the Web and the Internet. A prominent study of the Web link structure shows that the Web has a "bow-tie" shape, consisting of a single large strongly connected component (SCC), and other groups of nodes that can either reach the SCC or can be reached from the SCC. We show that online social networks have a similar large component, but its relative size is much larger than that of the Web’s SCC. Faloutsos et al. show that the degree distribution of the Internet follows a power-law, and Siganos et al. demonstrate that the high-level structure of the Internet resembles a "jellyfish."

Kleinberg demonstrates that high-degree pages in the Web can be identified by their function as either hubs (containing useful references on a subject) or authorities (containing relevant information on a subject). Kleinberg also presents an algorithm for inferring which pages function as hubs and which as authorities. The well-known PageRank algorithm uses the Web structure to determine pages that contain authoritative information.

### 3.3 Complex Network Theory

There has been extensive theoretical work on the properties of various classes of complex graphs. Random networks have been extensively studied, starting with the seminal paper by Erdős and Rényi. These graphs are usually constructed by randomly adding links to a static set of nodes. Researchers have shown that random graphs tend to have very short paths between any two nodes. More recent work on random graphs has explored their properties in more detail.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Data Collection

We collected data from four popular online social networks: Flickr, YouTube, LiveJournal, and Orkut. Our data collection process involved crawling publicly accessible user links on each site. We used a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the network, starting from a set of seed nodes. The BFS ensures that we explore the network in a systematic manner, covering a large portion of the graph.

### 4.2 Data Limitations

While our data collection method allowed us to gather a substantial amount of data, there are several limitations to consider. First, the data is limited to the publicly accessible parts of the networks, which may not represent the entire user base. Second, the BFS approach may not capture the entire network if there are disconnected components. Third, the data is a snapshot in time and does not account for the dynamic nature of social networks.

## 5. Structural Properties

### 5.1 Power-Law, Small-World, and Scale-Free Properties

Our results confirm the power-law, small-world, and scale-free properties of online social networks. The degree distribution of the networks follows a power-law, indicating that a small number of nodes have a disproportionately large number of connections. The small-world property is evident from the short average path lengths and high clustering coefficients. The scale-free property is reflected in the presence of a few highly connected nodes (hubs) that connect the majority of the network.

### 5.2 Reciprocity and Degree Correlation

We observe a high degree of reciprocity in directed user links, leading to a strong correlation between user indegree and outdegree. This is in contrast to content graphs like the Web, where popular pages (authorities) and pages with many references (hubs) are distinct. The high reciprocity in social networks suggests that users tend to form mutual connections, reinforcing the social ties within the network.

### 5.3 Core-Periphery Structure

The networks contain a large, strongly connected core of high-degree nodes, surrounded by many small clusters of low-degree nodes. This core-periphery structure suggests that high-degree nodes in the core are critical for the connectivity and information flow in these networks. The core acts as a bridge, connecting the peripheral nodes and facilitating the spread of information.

## 6. Implications

### 6.1 Design of Social Network-Based Systems

Understanding the structural properties of online social networks has several implications for the design of social network-based systems. The high reciprocity and degree correlation suggest that trust and reputation metrics should take into account the mutual connections between users. The core-periphery structure highlights the importance of high-degree nodes in maintaining the network's connectivity and information flow. Designers of social network-based systems should consider these properties to ensure robust and efficient communication and information dissemination.

### 6.2 Security and Robustness

The robustness of online social networks to deliberate attempts at manipulation is an important consideration. The presence of a densely connected core makes the network resilient to random node failures but vulnerable to targeted attacks on high-degree nodes. Understanding the structural properties can help in designing more secure and resilient social networks.

### 6.3 Future Research Directions

Future research can build on our findings to explore the dynamics of online social networks, including the evolution of the network over time and the impact of external factors on the network's structure. Additionally, the development of efficient algorithms to infer the actual degree of shared interest between users and the reliability of users can further enhance the functionality and security of social network-based systems.

## 7. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a large-scale measurement study and analysis of the structure of multiple online social networks. Our results confirm the power-law, small-world, and scale-free properties of these networks and provide new insights into the reciprocity and core-periphery structure. These findings have important implications for the design of social network-based systems and the understanding of the impact of online social networks on the future Internet. We hope that our work will serve as a foundation for future research in this area.
