### 5.4 Feature Differentiability

This section addresses the challenge of differentiating among feature sets. By extracting features and plotting two feature vectors against each other, sorted by closest pulse count, clustering diagrams visualize the differentiability of the feature sets. Figure 17 demonstrates that the classifiers can produce sufficient distinction between seven individuals in both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) cases. This clustering diagram does not include packet count or timing information.

**Figure 17:** Clustering diagram of gait features demonstrating differentiation with the two feature sets aligned by time.

When removing packets with little Doppler or multipath interference and adding packet count to the feature set, the simple Naïve Bayes classifier achieved 87% accuracy in LoS and 77% accuracy in NLoS (Table 1).

### 6. Related Work

This section describes previous studies addressing the challenges of monitoring human actions and modeling behaviors through body part tracking, person identification, and individual localization [29]. Current sensors used include RF antennas, cameras, capacitors, accelerometers, and ultrasonic detectors. The following sections categorize previous work by image capture (Section 6.1) and RF (Section 6.2). All reviewed RF works have failed to identify and localize individuals based on intrinsic body movements.

Unlike previous research, this paper profiles human gait by encoding multipathing and the Doppler Effect to create biometric signatures, enabling tracking and tagging. This technique uses existing Wi-Fi signals with only a receiver SDR system, achieving through-wall penetration.

#### 6.1 Imaging Capture and Processing

This section discusses recent research on human identification using computer vision. Traditional image capture systems require direct LoS or special thermal cameras, which are expensive in terms of installation and computational needs. Cameras also raise privacy and information assurance issues due to their vulnerability to hacking.

Leveraging the computational power of the cloud, eyewear can detect subjects using facial recognition [35]. InSight provides identification without facial recognition by matching color patterns and behavior [33]. PIXEL enables light-based positioning systems using low-resolution cameras [40].

#### 6.2 RF and Wireless Systems

This section discusses previous research on sensing human movements using RF (Section 6.2.1) and RF-based localization techniques (Section 6.2.2). RF allows for NLoS and lower-cost architecture. None of the reviewed research has produced biometrics on individuals' gaits.

##### 6.2.1 Using RF Waves to Sense Persons or Body Parts

Recent research using RF sensors has provided the possibility of automation. These systems can penetrate walls, track body parts, and sense multiple persons' locations [24]. The Channel State Information (CSI)-based CARM system identifies human body parts' speed and specific activities. WiDraw uses Wi-Fi signals' Angle-of-Arrival to track hand trajectories with an error rate below five cm, achieving 91% accuracy in recognizing letters, words, and sentences [30]. AAMouse turns a human hand into a mouse by measuring sound frequency shifts and the phase of Wi-Fi signals, with an error rate of 1.4 cm [42]. WiTrack uses Time-of-Flight from multiple antennas to locate individuals through walls [1], and WiTrack2.0 introduces Successive Silhouette Cancellation to localize multiple persons [3]. E-Gesture is an energy-efficient gesture recognition system using motion sensing and smartphones [25]. These systems focus on localization and movement detection but do not provide biometrics or specific person signature detection.

##### 6.2.2 Using Electromagnetic Waves to Localize

Tracking devices and individuals have been extensively studied using Signal Strength (SS), Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA), and Angle of Arrival (AoA) [22]. These techniques use statistical algorithms with geometry to determine location. SpotOn uses CSI and applies algorithms to estimate direction and triangulation from multiple Wi-Fi access points, achieving 0.6m accuracy in LoS and 1.5m in NLoS [17]. Tadar tracks moving objects using Commercial RFID readers and tags in 2D, converting RFIDs into antenna arrays for through-wall detection [38]. FollowME uses geomagnetic fields and natural walking patterns for navigation in indoor and semi-outdoor scenarios [28]. APIT is a range-free solution for random nodes with irregular radio patterns [12]. SpinLoc provides precise indoor localization using the Doppler Effect [7]. A distributed online learning algorithm converges on the location using a wireless sensor network [11].

### 7. Future Work

For Wobly to function in real-world scenarios, it must track multiple persons and adapt to room changes. WiTrack2.0 [3] has already studied tracking multiple persons and limbs. For multiple room configurations, the main methods are empirical-based machine learning and propagation scattering inversion. Machine learning requires calibration, while scattering inversion requires solving large amounts of non-linear Maxwell equations. Techniques like deep learning should also fit the changing scattered field to human movement, providing fine location information. Both techniques should model noise from weather or other interferences. We recognize that current empirical data is limited, requiring more diverse testing subjects, but Wobly extends existing gait-based biometric analysis.

### 8. Conclusions

We present Wobly, an SDR system that encodes individuals' gaits and room configurations by reflecting Wi-Fi signals off individuals. The encoded signatures preserve privacy through the uniqueness of how individuals move and channel interference. We demonstrated 1) methods of tracking individuals in LoS and NLoS, showing the uniqueness of signatures encoded by gaits and room configurations; 2) signal processing techniques to measure human bodies' Doppler shift and multipathing, creating biometric signatures; and 3) empirical analysis to differentiate people walking in LoS and NLoS. Using wavelets, Wobly characterized the signatures, providing feature vectors for a Naïve Bayes Classifier. A clustering visualization utilized the two feature vectors, demonstrating that individual gaits are differentiable. A simple Naïve Bayes classifier identified persons with 87% and 77% correctness in LoS and NLoS cases, respectively. Using Wi-Fi signals, this method penetrated a wall and did not require additional attached devices or special signals.
