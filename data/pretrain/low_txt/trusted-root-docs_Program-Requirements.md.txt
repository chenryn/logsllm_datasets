## 2. Continuing Program Requirements

### Audit Requirements
1. **Qualified Audit Evidence**: Program Participants must provide Microsoft with evidence of a Qualified Audit for each root, unconstrained subordinate CA, and cross-signed certificate before conducting commercial operations and annually thereafter.
2. **Responsibility for Compliance**: Program Participants are responsible for ensuring that all unconstrained subordinate CAs and cross-signed certificates meet the Program's audit requirements.
3. **Public Disclosure of Audit Reports**: CAs must publicly disclose all audit reports for unconstrained subordinate CAs.

### Communication and Disclosure Requirements
4. **Trusted Agents and Contact Information**:
   - Program Participants must provide Microsoft with the identities of at least two "Trusted Agents" to serve as representatives and one general email alias.
   - Changes in personnel must be communicated to Microsoft.
   - Notice is considered effective when Microsoft sends an email or official letter.
   - At least one contact or alias should be a 24/7 monitored channel for revocation requests and incident management.

5. **PKI Hierarchy Disclosure**:
   - Program Participants must disclose their full PKI hierarchy (including non-limited subordinate CAs, cross-signed non-enrolled root CAs, EKUs, and certificate constraints) to Microsoft annually.
   - This information must be kept accurate in the CCADB and updated when changes occur.
   - If a subordinate CA is not publicly disclosed or audited, it must be domain-constrained.

6. **Ownership Transfer Notification**:
   - Program Participants must inform Microsoft via email at least 120 days before transferring ownership of an enrolled root or subordinate CA to another entity or person.

7. **Revocation and CCADB Updates**:
   - Reason codes must be included in revocations for intermediate certificates.
   - CAs must update the CCADB within 30 days of revoking any intermediate certificates.

8. **Customer Notification**:
   - Program Participants agree that Microsoft may contact customers who may be substantially impacted by the pending removal of a root CA from the Program.

### Other Requirements
9. **Internal Use Restrictions**:
   - Commercial CAs may not enroll a root CA intended primarily for internal use within an organization (e.g., Enterprise CAs).

10. **Subcontractor Responsibility**:
    - If a CA uses a subcontractor, the CA assumes responsibility for the subcontractor's business operations.

11. **Certificate Revocation**:
    - If Microsoft identifies a certificate whose usage or attributes are contrary to the program's objectives, the CA must either revoke the certificate or request an exception within 24 hours of receiving notice.
    - Microsoft will review the submitted material and inform the CA of its final decision. If the exception is denied, the CA must revoke the certificate within 24 hours.

## 3. Program Technical Requirements

All CAs in the Program must comply with the following technical requirements. Non-compliance may result in exclusion from the Program.

### A. Root Requirements
1. **X.509 v3 Certificates**:
   - Root certificates must be X.509 v3 certificates.
   - The Common Name (CN) attribute must identify the publisher and be unique.
   - The CN attribute must be in a language appropriate for the CA's market and readable by a typical customer.
   - The Basic Constraints extension must be set to `cA=true`.
   - The Key Usage extension must be present, marked critical, and include `KeyCertSign` and `cRLSign`. If the Root CA Private Key is used for signing OCSP responses, the `digitalSignature` bit must be set.
   - Root key sizes must meet the requirements detailed in "Key Requirements."

2. **Self-Signed Root Certificates**:
   - Certificates added to the Trusted Root Store must be self-signed root certificates.

3. **Validity Period**:
   - Newly minted Root CAs must be valid for a minimum of 8 years and a maximum of 25 years from the date of submission.

4. **RSA Certificate Restrictions**:
   - Participating Root CAs may not issue new 1024-bit RSA certificates from roots covered by these requirements.

5. **AIA and CDP Extensions**:
   - All end-entity certificates must contain an AIA extension with a valid OCSP URL. These certificates may also contain a CDP extension with a valid CRL URL. All other certificate types must contain either an AIA extension with an OCSP URL or a CDP extension with a valid CRL URL.

6. **Unique Keys and Subject Names**:
   - Private keys and subject names must be unique per root certificate. Reuse of private keys or subject names in subsequent root certificates may result in unexpected certificate chaining issues.

7. **Government CAs**:
   - Government CAs must restrict server authentication to government-issued top-level domains and may only issue other certificates to the ISO3166 country codes that the country has sovereign control over. These TLDs are specified in each CA's respective contract.

8. **Separation of Uses**:
   - Issuing CA certificates that chain to a participating Root CA must separate Server Authentication, S/MIME, Code Signing, and Time Stamping uses. A single Issuing CA must not combine these uses; a separate intermediate must be used for each use case.

9. **Algorithm and Key Size Requirements**:
   - End-entity certificates must meet the requirements for algorithm type and key size for Subscriber certificates listed in Appendix A of the CAB Forum Baseline Requirements.

10. **Policy OIDs**:
    - CAs must declare one of the following policy OIDs in the Certificate Policy extension of end-entity certificates:
      - DV: 2.23.140.1.2.1
      - OV: 2.23.140.1.2.2
      - EV: 2.23.140.1.1
      - IV: 2.23.140.1.2.3
      - EV Code Signing: 2.23.140.1.3
      - Non-EV Code Signing: 2.23.140.1.4.1

11. **Basic Constraints for End-Entity Certificates**:
    - End-entity certificates that include a Basic Constraints extension must have the `cA` field set to `FALSE`, and the `pathLenConstraint` field must be absent.

12. **OCSP Responder Constraints**:
    - A CA must technically constrain an OCSP responder such that the only EKU allowed is OCSP Signing.

13. **Revocation to a Specific Date**:
    - A CA must be able to revoke a certificate to a specific date as requested by Microsoft.

### B. Signature Requirements
| Algorithm | All Uses Except for Code Signing and Time Stamping | Code Signing and Time Stamping Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Digest Algorithms | SHA2 (SHA256, SHA384, SHA512) | SHA2 (SHA256, SHA384, SHA512) |
| RSA | 2048 | 4096 (New roots only) |
| ECC / ECDSA | NIST P-256, P-384, P-521 | NIST P-256, P-384, P-521 |

### C. Revocation Requirements
1. **Documented Revocation Policy**:
   - The CA must have a documented revocation policy and the ability to revoke any certificate it issues.

2. **OCSP Responder Requirements**:
   - CAs that issue Server Authentication certificates must support the following OCSP responder requirements:
     - Minimum validity of eight (8) hours; Maximum validity of seven (7) days.
     - The next update must be available at least eight (8) hours before the current period expires. If the validity is more than 16 hours, then the next update must be available at Â½ of the validity period.

3. **CRL Distribution Point and AIA**:
   - All certificates issued from a root CA must support either the CRL distribution point extension and/or AIA containing an OCSP responder URL.

4. **Root Certificate Use**:
   - The CA must not use the root certificate to issue end-entity certificates.

5. **Time Stamp Authority**:
   - If a CA issues Code Signing certificates, it must use a Time Stamp Authority that complies with RFC 3161, "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)."

### D. Code Signing Root Certificate Requirements
1. **Removal from Distribution**:
   - Root certificates that support code signing use may be removed from distribution by the Program 10 years from the date of distribution of a replacement rollover root certificate or sooner, if requested by the CA.

2. **Algorithm Security Lifetime**:
   - Root certificates that remain in distribution to support only code signing use beyond their algorithm security lifetime (e.g., RSA 1024 = 2014, RSA 2048 = 2030) may be set to 'disable' in the Windows 10 OS.

### E. EKU Requirements
1. **Business Justification**:
   - CAs must provide a business justification for all EKUs assigned to their root certificate. Justification may be in the form of public evidence of a current business of issuing certificates of a type or types, or a business plan demonstrating an intention to issue those certificates in the near term (within one year of root certificate distribution by the Program).

2. **Enabled EKUs**:
   - Microsoft will only enable the following EKUs:
     - Server Authentication: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1
     - Client Authentication: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2
     - Secure Email: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4
     - Time Stamping: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.8
     - Document Signing: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.12 (used for signing documents within Office; not required for other document signing uses).

### F. Windows 10 Kernel Mode Code Signing (KMCS) Requirements
Windows 10 has heightened requirements for validating kernel-mode drivers. Drivers must be signed by both Microsoft and a Program partner using Extended Validation requirements. All developers who wish to have their kernel-mode drivers included in Windows must follow the procedures outlined by the Microsoft Hardware Development Team. For more information, see the [Partner Center for Windows Hardware](/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/).
