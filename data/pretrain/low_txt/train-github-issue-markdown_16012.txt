To navigate the menu using keyboard shortcuts, pressing `Alt+F` should open the `File` menu. Subsequently, you can press the `â†’` (right arrow) key to move to the `Edit` menu.

However, on Windows 7 and 8, this functionality does not work as expected once the main editor window has focus, except when the welcome page is active.

In contrast, on Ubuntu Linux with the Unity desktop environment, the menu bar can be activated and navigated normally using the keyboard.
