**How It All Started:**
- Discovered that London was planning to implement wireless devices for traffic detection.
- Further research revealed the vendor's name, which turned out to be a widely deployed and interesting target.
- The vendor has over 250 customers in 45 U.S. states and 10 countries, with more than 200,000 wireless sensors deployed globally, primarily in the U.S., UK, China, Canada, Australia, and France.
- After reviewing the available documentation, it became clear that the devices were likely insecure.

**Acquiring the Devices:**
- Socially engineered the vendor to obtain the devices.
- Shipped them to Puerto Rico and transported them back and forth to the U.S. from Argentina multiple times without any issues.

**Devices: Wireless Sensors**
- Magnetometer installed in a small hole.
- Rugged mechanical design with a 10-year battery life.
- TI CC2430 RF transceiver IEEE 802.15.4 system-on-chip operating at 2.4 GHz.
- TI MSP430 MCU (microcontroller) with a 16-bit RISC CPU, likely running TinyOS RTOS.

**Devices: Access Point**
- Processes, stores, and/or relays sensor data using uCLinux.
- Equipped with a 66 MHz 5272 Coldfire processor, 4 MB flash memory, and 16 MB DRAM.
- Supports contact closure to traffic controllers, IP (fiber or cellular) to central servers, and Power over Ethernet (PoE).
- Can support an unlimited number of sensors and serve as an IP router for peripherals like video cameras.

**Devices: Repeaters**
- Battery-powered units.
- Can support up to 10 wireless sensors.
- Relays detection data back to the access point, extending the range.
- Uses one channel for receiving data and another for sending data.

**Device Communication Ranges:**
- [Details on communication ranges and coverage]

**How the Devices Work:**
- [Explanation of device operation and interaction]

**Software:**
- Windows-based software for managing and configuring access points, repeaters, and sensors.
- Coded in Flash/ActionScript (Adobe AIR), making it easy to decompile.
- Connects directly to the access point to send commands to sensors and repeaters.
- Server software collects information from access points and forwards it to traffic control systems.
- Cloud-based SaaS for remote access to access points from anywhere in the world.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **No Encryption:** All wireless communication is in clear text.
  - Vendor claims: "Security: SNP radio transmissions never carry commands; only data is transmitted. Therefore, while RF communications may be subject to local interference, there is no opportunity to embed malicious instructions to a network device or upstream traffic system."
  - "The option for encrypting the over-the-air information was removed early in the product's lifecycle based on customer feedback. There was nothing broken on the system as we did not intend the over-the-air information to be protected."

- **No Authentication:**
  - Sensors and repeaters can be accessed and manipulated over the air by anyone, including firmware updates.
  - The access point does not authenticate sensors, blindly trusting wireless data.

- **Firmware Updates:**
  - Firmware updates are neither encrypted nor signed.
  - Anyone can modify the firmware and update it on sensors and repeaters.
  - Vendor claims: "We are encrypting/signing firmware in new sensor versions" (they just forgot a little and insignificant detail…)
  - "Security: Proprietary protocol – hacker safe"

**Protocol:**
- **IEEE 802.15.4 PHY:**
  - Used by ZigBee and other wireless systems.
  - Data rate of 250 kbps, 16 frequency channels in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.

- **Sensys NanoPower (SNP) Protocol:**
  - Built on top of the 802.15.4 PHY as a Media Access Protocol (MAC).
  - The MAC layer is TDMA-based and uses headers similar to the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer.

- **Sensor Operation:**
  - Sensors stay awake for a minimum amount of time to prevent packet collisions.
  - They listen and transmit at specific time slots, while the access point can process sensor packets at any time.
  - Sensors transmit every 30 seconds if no detection (configurable).
  - The access point acknowledges reception; each sensor retransmits data (4-5 times then sleeps) if unacknowledged.

- **Packet Structure:**
  - 80 80 55 AA BB 55 55 55 55 55 55 [frame header (2 bytes)] + [sequence # (1 byte)] + [address (2 bytes)] + [data]
  - Frame header specifies the type of packet.
  - Sequence number from sensor packets is used by the access point to acknowledge them.
  - Address identifies sensors by the access point, and the second byte in the address is a "color code" used by sensors to identify the access point.

- **Data Types:**
  - Data can be 4 to 50 bytes long, with the first two bytes indicating the data type.
  - Sensor data includes mode, version, battery level, and detection (presence or absence of traffic).
  - Access point data includes commands, synchronization, and firmware updates for sensors and repeaters.

- **Sample Packets:**
  - 80 41 69 CA B6 65 00 FF 7F -> Sensor to AP, no detection event, count mode
  - 80 41 67 CA B6 65 00 CE E7 -> Sensor to AP, detection event, count mode
  - 80 41 C0 CA B6 02 00 4C 00 03 00 03 BA 00 00 00 00 65 00 00 00 00 02 CA B6 FF 00 -> Sensor to AP, sensor info
  - 80 80 89 F0 FF 01 00 07 1E 40 07 C0 01 1A 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 40 20 01 00 -> AP to sensor

- **Firmware File:**
  - Proprietary format.
  - Example: l0012AF10DADAAAE1E60C5A00006A0200301330136C19021B3013A461D0303013301342
  - l0088AF10DADAAA6FC60D5A00006A0200308930896C8F02913089A4D7D0A63089308937
  - l2012301330133013301330131C1700130012030003004C00FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFDF
  - l2088308930893089308930891C8D00890088030003004C00FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFB9…

- **Firmware Update Packet:**
  - 80 00 45 F0 F4 D2 00 00 12 AF 10 DA DA AA E1 E6 0C 5A 00 00 6A 02 00 30 13 30 13 6C 19 02 1B 30 13 A4 61 D0 30 30 13 30 13
  - AP firmware broadcast, data part except the first two bytes is an exact line from the firmware file without the checksum byte.

**Tools:**
- **Hardware:**
  - TI CC2531 USB dongle for IEEE 802.15.4 sniffing.
  - TI SmartRF05 evaluation board.

- **Software:**
  - TI SmartRF Packet Sniffer IEEE 802.15.4.
  - TI SmartRF Studio 7.
  - IAR Embedded Workbench IDE.

**Attack Impact:**
- Over 200,000 sensors and an unknown number of repeaters worldwide could be compromised and potentially bricked.
- Traffic jams at intersections, ramps, and freeways.
  - Rest in green (exceeds maximum green time), red rest (all red until detection), flashing, incorrect speed limit displays, etc.
- Accidents, even fatal ones, due to car crashes or blocked emergency vehicles (ambulances, fire trucks, police cars, etc.).
- According to the U.S. DOT Federal Highway Administration (Traffic Detector Handbook): "…sensor malfunctions and associated signal failures increase motorists' time and delay, maintenance costs, accidents, and liability."

**On-Site Passive Testing:**
- Made the access point portable.
  - USB-powered instead of PoE, with a USB battery charger.
  - Portable Wi-Fi router powered by a battery, connected to a notebook via Wi-Fi.
- Carried the access point in a backpack and traveled to Seattle, New York, and Washington DC.
  - Sniffed around sidewalks while pointing the backpack in the right directions.
  - Encountered some suspicious individuals in DC but had no significant issues.
  - Video demonstration available.

**Attacks:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**
  - Disabling sensors/repeaters by changing configuration or firmware.
  - Making sensors/repeaters temporarily (or permanently) unusable by modifying firmware.
  - Flooding the access point with fake packets.

- **Fake Traffic Detection Data:**
  - Sending numerous car detections when there is no traffic.
  - Sending no detection on stop bars at exit ramps.
  - Disabling sensors/repeaters and sending no detection data when there is heavy traffic.

- **Deployment Locations:**
  - Easily identifiable through vendor and partner PR, presentations, city traffic department documents, news, approved vendors, RFPs, and Google Street View.
  - Attackers need to be within 1000 feet of the devices.
    - On-site attack demonstration.
    - Attaching attack devices with GPS to buses, taxis, and cars.
    - Launching attacks from the sky using drones (drones on demand).

- **Malicious Firmware Update Worm:**
  - Compromising one sensor with malicious firmware, which can then replicate to other sensors.
  - Impossible to determine if sensors are already compromised since the firmware version is returned by the firmware itself.

- **Advanced Attacks:**
  - Real-time location tracking, hacking smartphones, and launching targeted attacks.
  - Using sensor car identification data to trigger bombs when a target vehicle is nearby, without the need for tracking, just by sniffing wireless packets (e.g., Cadillac One fingerprint).

**Conclusions:**
- Any individual, even from a third-world country, can easily obtain and hack devices used in U.S. critical infrastructure.
- A $100 device can cause significant traffic disruptions in major U.S. cities and other large cities worldwide.
- Critical infrastructure technologies should undergo thorough security audits before deployment.
- Smart cities are not truly smart if the data they rely on is blindly trusted and easily manipulated.
- Cyber warfare is inexpensive.

**Closing Remarks:**
- "Battles can be won by being smart, not just by having great attack power. We need to focus more on ideas, innovation, and doing things differently, as hackers often do."
