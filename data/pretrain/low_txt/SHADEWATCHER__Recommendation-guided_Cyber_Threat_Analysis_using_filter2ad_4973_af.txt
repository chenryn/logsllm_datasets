#### System Auditing and Threat Analysis
Several approaches, such as record-and-replay systems [9], [94], and application log fusing [39], [95], [96], have been proposed to enhance system auditing. Although SHADEWATCHER has a different scope, it benefits from reducing noisy records and accurately tracking causality, which improves the quality of system entity interactions for cyber threat analysis. The ultimate objectives of system auditing are forensic investigation and intrusion detection. Recent studies have focused on improving these objectives by prioritizing causality tracking [10], [24], enhancing threat queries [97]–[99], and abstracting high-level behaviors [31]. Current attack detection methods can be categorized into three main directions: statistical analysis [11], [21], specification matching [16], [17], [19], and learning-driven prediction [22], [73], which we will discuss in § II-B.

#### Knowledge Graph-based Recommendation
Recommendation systems play a crucial role in various user-oriented applications by capturing user preferences for items. Collaborative filtering, a prevalent solution, extracts behavioral patterns from historical user-item interactions to infer user preferences [28], [100]. To enhance recommendation performance, researchers have introduced knowledge graphs (KGs), which provide rich content-related information and supplement behavioral similarities among users. Current research on KG-based recommendation can be divided into three main lines:
1. **Embedding-based Methods** [55], [101]: These methods focus on first-order connectivity in a KG and derive knowledge-aware embeddings [33], [52] to enrich item representations.
2. **Path-based Methods**: These methods consider higher-order connectivity in the KG and extract multi-hop paths connecting the target user and items through brute-force searching [102], meta-path matching [103], or reinforcement learning [104].
3. **GNN-based Methods** [29], [30]: These methods use graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode higher-order connectivity into the representations of users and items, leveraging GNNs' information propagation and aggregation mechanisms.

By identifying different-order connectivities in audit records, SHADEWATCHER introduces the first recommendation system that detects cyber threats by predicting the preferences of system entities on interactions.

### Conclusion
In this paper, we present SHADEWATCHER, a recommendation-guided cyber threat detection system. It is the first to apply the benefits of recommendation systems to the analysis of audit records. By utilizing both first-order and higher-order information in audit records, SHADEWATCHER models the preferences of system entities for their interactive entities and recommends potential adversarial interactions. We evaluated SHADEWATCHER using two datasets: one containing real-life APT campaigns and another with simulated cyber-attacks. The results show that SHADEWATCHER achieves high accuracy in threat detection with false alarm rates of 0.332% and 0.137%.
