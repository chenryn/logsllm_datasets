### Concentrations Observed Empirically
In terms of immediate future work, there is no inherent limitation to the search-redirection attack that restricts it to online pharmacies. While counterfeit drugs are a pressing issue due to their inherent danger, other purveyors of black-market goods, such as counterfeit software or luxury goods replicas, might also employ affiliates who manipulate search results with infected websites for advertising purposes.

### Pilot Experiment on Counterfeit Software
We conducted a brief 12-day pilot experiment in October 2010 to assess how search-redirection attacks apply to counterfeit software. Using 466 queries generated from Google Adwords Keyword Tool, we identified 328 infected source domains, 72 redirect domains, and 140 domains selling counterfeit software. Applying the same clustering techniques described earlier in the paper, we discovered two dominant connected components in the network: one responsible for 44% of the identified infections and the other for 30% of the software-selling sites.

### Overlap and Fragmentation
We observed a small but significant (12.5%) overlap in the set of redirection domains used for both counterfeit software and online pharmacies. This suggests that some redirection domains provide generic traffic redirection services for various types of illicit trade. However, the limited overlap also indicates fragmentation among different fraudulent trading activities. We have initiated a longitudinal study of all retail operations benefiting from search-redirection attacks to better understand the economic relationships between advertisers and resellers.

### Importance of Systematic Monitoring
Systematic monitoring of web search results is likely to become increasingly important, given the value miscreants have already identified in manipulating outcomes. Understanding the structure of attackers' networks provides defenders with a strong advantage when devising countermeasures.

### Additional Query-Sample Validation
We have collected two additional sets of search queries to compare with our main corpus of 218 terms. First, we derived a query set from an exhaustive list of 9,000 prescription drugs provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
