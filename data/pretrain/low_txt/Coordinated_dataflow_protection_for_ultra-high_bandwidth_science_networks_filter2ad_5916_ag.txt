### Input and Output Port Mappings

For spoof protection, an input port mapping is implemented. Additionally, a tagID to output port mapping is used for tag-based forwarding. These two mappings result in an approximate 12% drop in throughput compared to line rates. When using 9000-byte packet sizes, the throughput drop is approximately 6.6%.

### Connection Tracking

Next, we compare flow-based connection tracking, where a 6-tuple (source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, transport protocol, and flags) is stored for traffic tracking and filtering, with tag-based connection tracking. Our findings indicate that tag-based connection tracking provides a throughput improvement of approximately 2-10% over flow-based connection tracking.

When compared to stateless ACL-based filtering, tag-based connection tracking shows an improvement in throughput of approximately 1.5-4.0%.

### Related Work

Our research builds on prior work in rule-based and graph-based policy frameworks. A key limitation of existing SDN-based policy frameworks [2, 19, 21, 26, 36, 42] is their inability to directly capture fine-grained and sensitive dataflow-based policies.

#### A.2 Security Use Cases

To demonstrate the capability of CoordiNetZ to support a range of security policies involving data with varying sensitivities, we present the following use cases:

1. **Preventing DTN hosts from tag spoofing flows** to bypass SDN-enforced flow controls.
2. **Preventing malicious exfiltration of sensitive data.**
3. **Demonstrating improved performance** with tag-based connection tracking.

These use cases highlight the flexibility and effectiveness of CoordiNetZ in enhancing network security.
