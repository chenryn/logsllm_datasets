### Introduction

For safety-, mission-, or security-critical systems, regulations or acquisition guidelines typically require a documented body of evidence to provide a compelling case that the system satisfies specified critical properties. In other words, an argument is needed to "make the case" for the system's suitability or quality. These guidelines may use terms such as safety case, certification report, or security case; we collectively refer to them as assurance cases.

It is essential that the framework for developing and assessing assurance cases be both effective and efficient, as it forms the basis for making critical decisions about software systems where the consequences of failure can be substantial. However, the costs and constraints associated with creating and maintaining assurance cases can often exceed those of the software development itself. We observe that, in general, frameworks for assurance cases could be significantly improved, particularly in terms of their maintenance once they are produced.

### Purpose of the Workshop

The primary goal of this workshop is to facilitate communication among groups facing similar challenges in the creation and maintenance of assurance cases. Often, these groups are unaware of the work being done in other, similar communities. We hope that the workshop will initiate a process of ongoing, cross-disciplinary discussions on the central challenges and opportunities for assurance cases, and will help in the development of a standard set of best practices and guidelines for creating and evaluating assurance cases.

In addition to specific summary outputs from the workshop, we will use this opportunity to gauge interest and commitment in forming an IEEE-sponsored planning group to address possible standards activities for assurance cases. At a minimum, we aim to make this the first in a series of annual workshops on assurance cases and begin to form a cross-disciplinary community of interest.

### Workshop Structure

The workshop is structured into three sessions:

1. **Current Best Practices, Experiences, and Recurring Challenges:**
   - This session will focus on sharing current best practices, experiences, and recurring challenges in the development and assessment of assurance cases.

2. **Promising Research and New Opportunities:**
   - This session will explore promising research (tools, notations, techniques, etc.) and new opportunities for developing, reviewing, and maintaining assurance cases.

3. **Summary, Discussion, and Next Steps:**
   - The final session will include a summary and review of key points from the first two sessions, a moderated discussion on important consensus and disagreements, and the identification of next steps.

### Follow-Up and Proceedings

Position papers, presentations, and follow-up materials from the workshop will be posted on the workshop website: [www.aitcnet.org/AssuranceCases](http://www.aitcnet.org/AssuranceCases).
