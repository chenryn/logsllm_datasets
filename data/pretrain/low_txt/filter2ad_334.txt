## Abstract

Historically, the computer industry has focused on improving raw performance and functionality. However, in recent years, dependability and maintainability have become equally important. While there are well-established methods to evaluate and compare performance and functionality, assessing dependability and maintainability is significantly more challenging. These challenges include accounting for software failures, off-the-shelf hardware and software components, typical maintenance and operational procedures, and the varying requirements across different application areas.

## Introduction

The Dependability Benchmarking Workshop aims to provide a platform for both the computer industry and academia to discuss the issues surrounding the evaluation and characterization of dependability and maintainability in components and computer systems. The workshop will focus on identifying dependability benchmarking measures and essential technologies, including experimental measuring and modeling techniques. The goal is to gather ideas for practical and cost-effective ways to assess these critical features.

## Background

This workshop is the result of two years of work by the IFIP 10.4 Working Group Special Interest Group on Dependability Benchmarking (SIGDeB). Formed in November 1999, SIGDeB was established to promote research, practice, and adoption of benchmarks for computer-related system dependability. Philip Koopman and Henrique Madeira were the founding co-chairs.

### SIGDeB Charter

SIGDeB's charter focuses on four key areas:
- **Exchanging Ideas:** Facilitating the exchange of ideas about dependability benchmarking among researchers, practitioners, universities, industry, and government agencies.
- **State of the Art Documentation:** Documenting the current state of the art in dependability measurement and benchmarking.
- **Issue Identification:** Creating lists of issues that need to be resolved to advance dependability benchmarking to a mature science.
- **Benchmark Proposal Mechanism:** Proposing a mechanism and agenda for a group to propose dependability benchmarks.

While these are long-term objectives, several papers presented at the workshop are the results of SIGDeB collaborations that have made significant progress. This event marks the first focused public forum for discussing dependability benchmarking.

## Related Research Programs

During the time SIGDeB has been active, two other research programs have emerged to address related areas: DBench and HDCP. Both programs have overlapping membership with SIGDeB but differ in their specific goals.

### DBench

DBench is a three-year European research program aimed at defining a conceptual framework and an experimental environment for benchmarking the dependability of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and COTS-based systems. It emphasizes dependability measurement, identification of malfunctions/weaknesses, tuning components to improve dependability, and dependability comparisons. Most measurements use fault injection, and the majority of participants come from the fault-tolerant computing community.

### HDCP

The High Dependability Computing Program (HDCP) is a long-term collaboration between U.S. universities and NASA, with expected industry participation. Its goal is to ensure that software meets the increasingly stringent requirements of continuous operation, safety-critical reliability, high integrity, and high security. HDCP primarily involves researchers from the software engineering community.

## Contributions

We are pleased to present papers from SIGDeB, DBench, HDCP, and other researchers not formally affiliated with these groups. These contributions reflect the diverse and collaborative nature of the dependability benchmarking community.
