### User Attitudes and Beliefs on SSL Warnings

When users become victims of fraud, they are unlikely to attribute it to their decision to ignore security warnings. Therefore, users' attitudes and beliefs about SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) warnings can undermine the effectiveness of these alerts [3]. The most effective approach to protect users might be to avoid SSL warnings altogether and instead make decisions on their behalf—blocking access to unsafe sites and remaining silent when the situation is safe.

### 5.1 Limitations

Our study did not measure the long-term effects of habituation to warnings. Many participants had likely seen the Firefox 2 (FF2) and Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) warnings before, while few had encountered the FF3 warnings, as that browser was released just prior to our study. Our two new warnings were unfamiliar to all participants. We expected that users would be more likely to ignore the IE7 and FF2 warnings due to habituation, but this was not supported by our data.

Several aspects of the study design may have influenced participants to behave less securely than they normally would. Participants knew in advance that they would use their bank credentials during the study, which may have deterred the most security-conscious individuals from participating. Additionally, the study was conducted at and sanctioned by Carnegie Mellon University, leading participants to trust that their credentials would not be at risk.

In our study, users were much less likely to heed certificate warnings compared to a previous study by Schechter et al. [17] that also examined user responses to the IE7 certificate warning. In our study, 90% of participants ignored the IE7 warning, whereas in Schechter et al.'s study, only 36% of participants who used their own accounts ignored the warning. We believe the differences may be due to the fact that in the previous study, participants were told the study was about online banking, performed four banking tasks before encountering the warning, and received two other clues that the website might be insecure. The authors noted, "responses to these clues may have been influenced by the presence of prior clues." Furthermore, the previous study was conducted while IE7 was still in beta, and thus users were less likely to have seen the certificate warning before. Additionally, our study participants were more technically sophisticated than those in the previous study.

### 5.2 Explain the Danger

The FF2, IE7, and our single-page warnings take the standard approach of explaining the potential danger to users. The FF2 warning, an unalarming popup box with obscure language, did little to prevent users from visiting the bank or library. The IE7 warning, with clearer language and a more alarming appearance, was no more effective. Conversely, our single-page warning, with its black and red colors, was the most effective of the five warnings in preventing users from visiting the bank website. Only four users called the library, indicating that our single-page warning would be only a minor nuisance for legitimate websites. However, we suspect that our single-page warning would become less effective as users become habituated to it through frequent visits to legitimate sites.

### 5.3 Make it Difficult

The FF3 warning, as discussed in Section 4.2.2, prevents users from visiting websites with invalid certificates by confusing them and making it difficult to ignore the warning. This improves user behavior in risky situations like the bank task but presents a significant nuisance in safer situations like the library task. Many legitimate websites that use self-signed certificates have posted online tutorials teaching users how to override the FF3 warning. Users who learn to bypass the warning through these tutorials, trial and error, or help from friends will likely ignore subsequent warnings, leaving them both annoyed and unprotected.

### 5.4 Ask a Question

Our multi-page warning, introduced in Section 4.1.2, asks the user a question to collect contextual information, allowing the browser to better assess the risk of proceeding to the website. This warning has two usability issues: users may answer incorrectly due to confusion, or they may knowingly provide incorrect answers to bypass the warning. Additionally, it leaves users susceptible to active attacks such as finer-grained origins attacks [9]. These problems, combined with the fact that the single-page warning was more successful in preventing users from visiting the bank website, lead us to recommend against using the multi-page warning in its current form.

The multi-page warning depends on users correctly answering the question, but only 15 out of 20 participants answered correctly at the bank website. As discussed in Section 4.2.2, we believe that five participants either knowingly gave the wrong answer to reach the destination website without interruption or confused the warning with a server unavailable error. Even when users answered correctly, they behaved no more securely than users of our single-page warning.

Users who answered correctly and followed the advice would still be vulnerable to finer-grained origins attacks. An attacker with control over the network or DNS can circumvent the multi-page warning by forcing the browser to connect to a different website. For example, if Alice visits a webmail site (www.mail.com) and an attacker controls the network, they can forward her browser to https://www.bank.com/action.js. The attacker then intercepts the connection with a self-signed certificate, triggering the warning. If Alice answers "other" because she believes she is visiting her webmail, the browser's cache will store the attack script. If Alice logs into www.bank.com within the next year, the attacker's version of action.js will load instead of the bank's version, stealing her secure cookies.

Designing an interface to collect contextual information from users without making them susceptible to active attacks is challenging. While we can ask simple questions about their intentions, we must ensure that attackers cannot mislead users. We may improve the multi-page warning by asking additional questions in certain circumstances. For instance, if the URL of the connecting website differs significantly from the one the user typed, we could show the URL and ask if they intended to visit it. However, this is not a complete solution for websites with mixed content, and the usability of such a solution remains untested.

### 5.5 Avoid Warnings

The ideal solution to SSL warning problems is to block access when users are in true danger and allow them to proceed when they are not. This ideal is probably unattainable, but two systems recently presented by the research community, ForceHTTPS [10] and Perspectives [20], are steps in the right direction. Both systems identify potentially unsafe websites and use warnings to stop users from proceeding. It would be better to block these unsafe websites entirely. We expect both systems to have extremely low false positive rates, but further evaluation is needed to confirm this.

Another possible way to identify unsafe websites is to maintain a list of websites verified by a root certificate authority and block websites on the list when the browser receives a self-signed certificate instead.
