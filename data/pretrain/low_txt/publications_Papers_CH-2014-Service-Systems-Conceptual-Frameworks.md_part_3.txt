### Purpose of Service Exchange

The purpose of service exchange is to achieve mutually beneficial value co-creation. This means that entities within a service system engage in the exchange by integrating their resources with those of their exchange partners to jointly create value for all involved parties. While mutually beneficial value co-creation is the intended favorable outcome, the model also recognizes other possible (and potentially unfavorable) outcomes, as outlined in the ISPAR model of service interaction outcomes [11].

### 2.5.2 Mutually Beneficial Value Co-Creation

The Resource-Service-System (RSS) model aligns with the service-dominant economic worldview proposed by the Service-Dominant Logic (SDL). Both theories share similar concepts, such as operant and operand resources and services. Although SDL does not explicitly use the term "service system," it is clear that the concept of an actor in SDL is equivalent to the service system entity in the RSS model. Therefore, in the integrated concept map (Fig. 2.7), the actor concept is replaced with the service system entity concept.

Adding the RSS model enriches the conceptual framework of service that we have been developing. First, the RSS model emphasizes that, in an economic context, service is exchanged for service through interactions between service system entities. The core concept here is service exchange, not just service. Consequently, while SDL focuses on value co-creation as the creation of value by two actors for one of them, the RSS model clarifies that the purpose of service exchange is to create value jointly for both service beneficiaries.

Second, the RSS model, like the work system perspective described in [4], acknowledges that the intended outcome of these interactions may differ from the actual outcome. This recognition adds a layer of complexity and realism to the model.

### 2.5.3 From Service System to Service Exchange Between Service System Entities

The detailed description of service exchange in terms of interactions between service system entities, whether through joint or separate activities, provides a bridge to theories that focus more on the production and operational aspects of service processes and systems. In the Work system metamodel, a service system activity is an activity as defined by the RSS model. This is also true for an activity in the customer work system, which may or may not coincide with a provider's service system activity.

The concept of an interaction episode in the RSS model is similar to the concept of a process in the Unified Services Theory, but it specifically represents the actual conduct of activities in a single instance of service execution, distinguishing it from a process "model." The service system concept in the Work system metamodel differs from the service system entity in the RSS model. A service system entity (or actor in SDL; hence, producer/consumer in the Unified Services Theory) requires a work system (containing production processes) to perform a service.

A service system entity can itself be a resource in a larger work system. This is consistent with the systemic view of the RSS model, where a service system entity can act as an operant resource in a service exchanged by a supra-entity controlling the entity. This also covers scenarios where consumers are used as inputs in service processes, according to the Unified Services Theory, and fully automated service systems that perform actor roles in higher-level service systems, as made possible by the Work system metamodel.

While the operational details in the Work system metamodel surpass those in the RSS model, the latter introduces the concept of service exchange, making the integration valuable. It allows for the creation of a more complete concept base for designing a white-box service description language.

### 2.6 Summary and Conclusions

At the end of this chapter, we emphasize that the integrated concept map (Fig. 2.7) was developed by gradually integrating the concept maps of the selected theories. Where possible, concepts from different theories with identical or very similar definitions were unified, allowing for the establishment of relationships that cross theoretical boundaries. However, the map in Fig. 2.7 is not a conceptual model of an integrated descriptive theory of service due to fundamental differences in views on the nature of service and value creation. Therefore, multiple interpretations of service and value creation coexist.

All four theories consider service as an "occurrent" or "perdurant" rather than a "continuant" or "endurant," meaning something that happens rather than something that exists. While the definition of service in SDL, the Work system metamodel, and the RSS model is almost identical (i.e., service is a process that benefits someone else), the Unified Services Theory, which does not directly define service, recognizes the existence of non-service processes. However, the other three theories would argue that service is still brought about if these non-service processes produce outputs that consumers turn into benefits.

The real difference in the view of service lies in how it is "produced." The Unified Services Theory is the most restrictive, requiring individual consumer inputs for service processes. Co-production is recognized by the Work system metamodel as customers participating as actors in the provider’s service system activities, but it is optional. There can be service without co-production, even without individual customer inputs available to the provider’s service system.

All four theories agree that the determination of value is the consumer's business. For SDL and the RSS model, value capture by the service beneficiary is value co-creation. For the Work system metamodel, value capture by the customer work system (or, as in the Unified Services Theory, the consumer’s consumption process) is not co-creation unless activities in the customer work system coincide with activities in the provider service system. Thus, there is a fundamental difference in the definition of value co-creation between the Work system metamodel and the other two theories.

The RSS model adheres to the same service-dominant economic worldview as SDL and stresses the praxeology of service. Economic actors exchange service for mutual benefit, making the exchange of service for service a mutually beneficial value co-creation phenomenon. Additionally, like the Work system metamodel, it recognizes that service is an outcome that is not always achieved, even when intended.

Despite these differences, the result of our analysis and modeling exercise (Fig. 2.7) is a rich, multi-perspective concept base for designing a service system model that provides a conceptual foundation for the LSS-USDL language. Each reviewed theory adds concepts that are potentially relevant to a white-box service system conceptualization. SDL emphasizes that service is a process of operant resources acting upon operand resources. The Unified Services Theory sees the service production process as distinct from the value extraction process. The Work system metamodel adds operational details to service production, involving different kinds of operant and operand resources, and introduces the notion of a service system. Finally, the RSS model adds the service exchange aspect and stresses that, in an economic context, value co-creation should be mutually beneficial. From a white-box perspective, this mutually beneficial value co-creation results from a series of activities, separately or jointly performed by service system entities, where these activities are part of the provider service system and/or customer work system and can be organized as processes. Processes, activities, and resources used as inputs or produced as outputs are all relevant concepts for a white-box service system conceptualization.
