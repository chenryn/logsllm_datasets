# Keystroke Statistical Learning Model for Web Authentication

**Authors:** Cheng-Huang Jiang, Shiuhpyng Shieh, and Jen-Chien Liu

## Introduction
This model enhances the accuracy of identity authentication by analyzing keystroke timing information for usernames and passwords. The system operates over HTTP on a web server.

## System Model
### Features
- **Statistical Learning Basis:** The model is based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Gaussian Modeling from Statistical Learning Theory.
- **Low Cost:** No additional hardware is required.
- **Transparency:** Users do not need to perform any redundant actions.
- **Error Rate:** The best error rate achieved is 2.54%.

## Performance Metrics
The performance of the model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **False Acceptance Rate (FAR):** The rate at which unauthorized users are incorrectly accepted.
- **False Rejection Rate (FRR):** The rate at which authorized users are incorrectly rejected.
- **Equal Error Rate (EER):** The point where FAR equals FRR, indicating the optimal threshold for the model.

### Results
- **Minimum Target String Length:** 9 characters
- **Reference Sample Size:** 20 samples
- **Equal Error Rate (EER):** 2.54%

#### Performance Plot
- **Threshold of Standard Deviation:**
  - FAR: 3.2, 3.5, 1.7, 1.4, 2.9, 1.1
  - FRR: 2, 2.3, 2.6

**Note:** The performance plot shows the relationship between FAR and FRR with different thresholds of standard deviation.
