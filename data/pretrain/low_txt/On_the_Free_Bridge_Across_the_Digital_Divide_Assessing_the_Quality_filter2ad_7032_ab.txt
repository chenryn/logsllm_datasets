## Size and Content Differences in Free Basics vs. Paid Versions

The guidelines for the normal versions of websites are 15 to 18 times larger than their Free Basics counterparts. This significant difference can be attributed to the use of high-resolution images and multiple JavaScript files in the paid versions, while the Free Basics versions typically contain only small images and no JavaScript.

## Absence of Advertisements in Free Basics

Further examination of the homepages of these services reveals that the Free Basics versions do not include any contextual or embedded advertisements. The lack of advertisements is likely due to restrictions on using JavaScript, which is commonly used to fetch and display ads. This restriction raises questions about the economic incentives for web service providers, who may find it challenging to monetize their services within the Free Basics framework.

## Technical Specifications and User Experience

The technical specifications for Free Basics are designed to support mobile users in developing regions, where devices may not have full web browsers and must access the internet via WAP or similar technologies. However, the functional restrictions on Free Basics services and their implications for the number of participating sites and the content they provide require further investigation and discussion. For example, determining whether users are satisfied with the offered services, despite the functional restrictions, would require field studies with Free Basics users.

## Impact of the "Walled Garden" on User Experience

Free Basics offers a limited set of services, and accessing any internet destination beyond this set incurs charges, with appropriate warnings shown to the user. To understand the impact of this "walled garden," we approximated its size by visiting every link from the homepage of each Free Basics service to determine if the result was a warning page indicating that the visited link is outside of Free Basics.

Figure 5(b) shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the percentage of URLs linked on the homepages of Free Basics services in Pakistan that are outside the Free Basics domain and give data warnings. Some services, like Accuweather, BBC, and ESPN, are mostly self-contained. However, 60% of the services have external links, which will cause breaks in the user's browsing experience. In some cases, such as VirtualpediatricHospital.org and SumirBD.mobi, 80-90% of the listed URLs are external links, rendering these services effectively useless.

### Example: Bing Search Engine
An interesting example is the Bing search engine, which is part of Free Basics in both South Africa and Pakistan. Table 3 shows the results for five representative searches in Pakistan, the number of results returned for each search, and the number of those results that are accessible using Free Basics. The key takeaway is that the vast majority of Bing search results cannot be followed by Free Basics users without incurring data charges.

Interestingly, it should be relatively easy to modify search output to rank results based on their accessibility within Free Basics. This would improve the user experience for all the queries in Table 3, as Free Basics has a significant number of services related to education, news, health, and job portals. The trade-off between offering a good user experience while keeping users restricted within the walled garden versus offering some tantalizing content out of reach of the free program is open for debate. Determining the merits of these approaches requires field studies.

## Network Performance

To measure the network service quality of Free Basics services, we conducted an experiment with three representative services in Pakistan: BBC, Cricinfo, and Mustakbil (a Pakistani job portal). We downloaded the landing page of each service and all pages linked to this first page simultaneously for both the Free Basics version and the normal mobile version with a paid connection. We logged the download time and size for each page, which were used for head-to-head comparisons.

### Page Fetch Speeds
Figure 5(c) shows the CDF of network speeds observed for the two versions of the same services. The CDF is computed over 346 HTML pages of the Free Basics version and 560 HTML pages of the normal version in Pakistan, and 155 HTML pages of the Free Basics version and 166 HTML pages of the normal version in South Africa.

We observed a marked difference in the two speed distributions in Pakistan, with the median speed being four times slower for Free Basics (80 Kbps) compared to the paid version (320 Kbps). The curve for the paid services shows a wide range of speeds typical of cellular broadband access, indicating that the provider has a capacity greater than 1 Mbps. However, Free Basics downloads never exceeded 128 Kbps, strongly suggesting that Free Basics traffic is throttled to a fraction of capacity.

In South Africa, the difference between the paid and free versions of BBC was less pronounced, but the free version never exceeded 600 Kbps, while the paid version saw more than double those peak speeds. In both countries, it is difficult to attribute performance differences to carrier-imposed throttling, proxy-imposed throttling, or path inflation on the path that includes the proxy. Isolating the source is part of our ongoing work.

### Page Fetch Times
Figure 6 shows the effect of download speeds on user experience, measured by page fetch times. For the four services, we observed a median increase of 2 to 6 seconds in page fetch times. The difference in page fetch times is also service-dependent, with Cricinfo seeing the worst delay, followed by BBC and Mustakbil. This ordering follows the page size distribution of the services, where the Free Basics version of Cricinfo had the largest pages, followed by BBC and Mustakbil. Thus, services with richer content lead to a substantially worse user experience.

We tested whether different services within the same country saw differential service and found no evidence of this (i.e., Free Basics performance was neutral with respect to service). Specifically, we compared performance between downloads of similar-sized pages from different services and did not see any performance differences across the services.

### Effect of Proxy
Xu et al. [14] found that the relative network locations of proxies between clients and servers can significantly impact performance. We pinged the IP addresses contacted for FreeBasics.com traffic to understand their network distance from clients. Interestingly, the reverse DNS name for these IPs is a hostname ending with facebook.com or fb.com, verifying the proxy-based architecture documented by Facebook. We issued traceroutes and used city codes in reverse DNS records for last-hop router IPs to determine that the proxies we observed for Pakistan are in Europe and those for South Africa are in the US.

Table 4 shows the ping latency from our client in Pakistan to the proxy and to the servers hosting the normal versions of BBC, Cricinfo, and Mustakbil. As seen from the table, the delay to the Free Basics proxy is relatively high (300 ms), largely due to the proxy being located in Europe (about 5000 miles from the client in Pakistan). This delay is six times larger than the delay to cricinfo.com, which is hosted in Pakistan, and more than 50% higher than the latency to bbc.com (likely hosted in Asia). The delay to mustakbil is essentially the same as to the Free Basics proxy, likely indicating that the service is hosted in Europe. Similar differences in ping delays are seen in South Africa, between the Free Basics proxy and the direct access to bbc.com.

Taken together, the performance results indicate that Free Basics users see poorer network performance to free sites than to paid ones. Whether this performance is tolerable to most users, and whether this is an acceptable price to pay for free service, requires further investigation with user studies and policy makers.

## Discussion and Future Work

This section further discusses the pros and cons of the Free Basics design and outlines plans to scale our current study. We also highlight important aspects of Free Basics that merit attention in future studies.

### Is Gate-keeping by Proxy Necessary?
One widely debated aspect of Free Basics is the gate-keeper role played by Facebook. While the technical specifications are well-justified (e.g., needed to make services accessible to resource-constrained feature-phone users), it is unclear why these cannot be enforced by a basic transcoding proxy that strips web services of excess functionality (e.g., JavaScript) on the fly to match the desired technical specifications. Such a design would alleviate the need for individual web service operators to redesign their services and separately request Facebook to approve their services. From a userâ€™s perspective, this design would tear down the wall around Free Basics services, make most traditional Internet services accessible, and significantly improve the user experience by limiting the number of broken (paid) links when browsing.

While the transcoding proxy described above has the potential to open up the walled garden of Free Basics services, it might raise incentive concerns for network service providers, who might see a steep decline in the conversion rate of their Free Basics users to paid users. Furthermore, the decision to have all Free Basics traffic transit via the proxy raises two important concerns. First, as shown in Section 3.3, the proxies are often geographically far from the Free Basics users and web servers, contributing to increased round-trip times and page download times for Free Basics users. Second, the proxy service provider has access to all, mostly unencrypted, end-user traffic. As an example of some of the potential privacy risks, the URIs exposed to Free Basics revealed information such as user locations (e.g., from weather query patterns in services like Accuweather) and political interests (e.g., from news browsing patterns in services like BBC).

### Net Neutrality Concerns
Many have raised network neutrality concerns regarding Free Basics, most notably in India. We found that in the two examples of Free Basics deployments that we studied, traffic for Free Basics received much worse performance than normal (paid) Internet traffic; however, all content within Free Basics received the same performance. Whether this constitutes a net neutrality violation is a matter of policy and is beyond the scope of this work. Another aspect of Free Basics that impacts net neutrality is differential pricing for content. In this sense, Free Basics may provide participating zero-rated services an advantage over those that do not participate. Understanding the implications of this on net neutrality is important but also outside the scope of this work.

### Future Work
We are currently working towards scaling our QoS measurements of Free Basics along different dimensions:
1. **Number of Countries**: We will recruit volunteers to measure the QoS of Free Basics deployments in more countries.
2. **Number of Locations in Each Country**: We are implementing an Android app to conduct measurements in the background, so our volunteers can easily measure at various locations using only a phone.
3. **Across Time**: Free Basics deployments are still in their infancy. We plan to monitor how the set of accessible web services changes over several months in several countries.
4. **Across Cellular Technologies**: In this paper, we used high-end phones featuring the latest cellular technologies like LTE. A recent study indicates that the majority of phones in developing countries are feature phones, supporting only older cellular technologies (3G, 2G, and GSM). This motivates the need to characterize performance for other cellular technologies and older devices.

### Need for Studies of Free Basics Users
The scope of this paper is limited to characterizing available Free Basics services and the performance for accessing them. Evaluating user satisfaction with Free Basics service choices, their free access to those services, and the quality of network performance they are given to access them requires focused field studies. Such studies are orthogonal and complementary to our focus. We hope that recent efforts towards understanding the usage of zero-rated services (where network service providers carry traffic for specific Internet services for free and charge for others) will be extended to cover Free Basics users as well.
