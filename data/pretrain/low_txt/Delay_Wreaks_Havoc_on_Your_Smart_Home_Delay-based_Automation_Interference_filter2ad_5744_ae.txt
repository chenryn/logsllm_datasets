  - **Rule 3 & 4:** 10-Unbounded
  - **Rule 6 & 7:** 10
  - **Rule 8 & 9:** 10–Unbounded
  - **Rule 10 & 11:** 16-47
  - **Rule 12 & 13:** 10–Unbounded
  - **Rule 14 & 15:** 10–Unbounded

- **T2:**
  - **Rule 1 & 2:** 120-600
  - **Rule 3 & 4:** 10–Unbounded
  - **Rule 5 & 6:** 16-47
  - **Rule 8 & 9:** 16-47

### Determining Allowable Delay Ranges

The allowable delay range for device events and commands is determined by:
1. **Interval of Periodical Messages:** Keep-alive requests between an IoT device/hub and a platform.
2. **Maximum Allowable Delay of Keep-Alive Reply.**
3. **Maximum Allowable Delay of Event/Command Reply.**

For example, the SmartThings hub sends a keep-alive request to the cloud if no activity has occurred for 31 seconds. It then sets a 16-second timer for a reply. If no reply is received, the connection is disconnected. The actual maximum delay is dynamic and depends on the timing of the event. For HomeKit, the delay range is 10 seconds with an unbounded upper limit due to the unpredictable nature of HomeKit-initiated requests.

### Verification of Attacks

All attacks listed in Table IV were successfully verified, as shown in Table V. The automation results indicate that successful attacks can cause annoyance, inconvenience, and even severe safety threats to smart home owners. Physical verification was conducted for all cases except for Rules 10 and 11 in T1 and Rules 5 and 6 in T2, where certain devices did not receive the turn-on command due to their outlets being off.

### Attack Opportunities

To evaluate the possibility of DAI attacks, we ran the testbeds for one week without any restrictions on daily activities. Infrequent rules (Rules 14 & 15 in T1 and Rules 8 & 9 in T2) were excluded. We collected device events and transformed them into a uniform format to track rule executions. By analyzing the event logs and execution tuples, we identified attack opportunities and success rates.

### Methodology for Identifying Attack Opportunities

We tracked the execution instances of each rule and performed a case-by-case analysis to find opportunities for DAI attacks. For example, for Rules 6 and 7 in T1, we checked if there was an execution tuple of Rule 7 within 2 seconds of Rule 6 and a door-closed event of the garage door. If true, it indicated an interaction that could be attacked.
