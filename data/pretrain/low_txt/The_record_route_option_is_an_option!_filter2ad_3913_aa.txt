## Abstract
The IPv4 Record Route (RR) Option instructs routers to record their IP addresses in a packet. RR is subject to a nine-hop limit and has traditionally received inconsistent support from routers. Recent changes in interdomain connectivity, known as the "flattening Internet," and new best practices for handling RR packets suggest that it is a good time to reassess the potential of the RR Option. We quantify the current utility of RR by issuing RR measurements from PlanetLab and M-Lab to every advertised BGP prefix. Our findings indicate that 75% of addresses that respond to pings without RR also respond to pings with RR, and 66% of these RR-responsive addresses are within the nine-hop limit of at least one vantage point. These results suggest that the RR Option is a useful measurement primitive on today’s Internet.

## 1. Introduction
Researchers and network operators need to understand Internet routing topology to troubleshoot problems. However, the protocols are not designed to reveal many details of Internet operations. The Internet is vast and complex, and it is administered by autonomous networks. Thus, the set of tools for measuring topology is limited, and many aspects of Internet routing remain opaque.

Given this limited visibility, the IP Record Route (RR) Option offers promising attributes as a measurement primitive. IP Options are a standard part of the Internet Protocol and can be enabled on any packet. Like traceroute, RR reports IP addresses along an Internet path from a source to a destination, but it offers several advantages. For example, RR can piece together the reverse path back from a destination, which is invisible to traceroute and other traditional techniques. It can also uncover some hops that do not respond to traceroute probes.

However, RR has limitations. It can only measure nine hops, which may not suffice to measure a full route. Even routers within that limit may drop or rate-limit RR packets, or forward them without recording an IP address, especially since IP Options are processed on the slow path by a router's resource-constrained route processor. A 2005 technical report found that 46% of PlanetLab-to-PlanetLab paths dropped RR packets, leading to the title, “IP Options are not an option.”

While it is true that IP Options are not a great option for supporting end-to-end IP extensibility, we revisit the suitability of the IP Record Route Option as a measurement primitive for today’s Internet. Specifically, we contribute the following results:
- Most pingable destinations respond to Record Route pings. Of nearly 300,000 IP addresses—each in a different routable BGP prefix—that responded to ICMP Echo Requests (pings), 75% also responded to pings with the RR Option. In total, we received RR responses from destinations in 40,545 Autonomous Systems (AS) (out of 49,100 for which we had destinations that responded to pings).
- Most responsive destinations are within Record Route range of our vantage points. Probing the destinations that respond to RR pings from M-Lab and PlanetLab, two-thirds are within the nine-hop RR limit of at least one vantage point, and 60% are within the eight-hop limit necessary to measure reverse paths from them to any host we control.
- The flattening Internet suggests that cloud providers can employ Record Route to good effect. Large cloud and content providers build out their backbones and peer broadly to bring their networks and services close to end-users. Our measurements suggest that Google is within eight hops of 86% of destinations that respond to RR pings, thus the IP Option can potentially solve much of Google’s need to uncover the paths from end-users to Google.
- Careful experiment design can increase RR response rates by avoiding triggering rate limiting. We reduce the impact of rate limiting and increase the response rate to RR probes by throttling the probing rate of specific vantage points and limiting the initial TTL of RR packets.

## 2. Motivation and Goal
Despite its drawbacks, Record Route has advantages over traceroute. First, while traceroute measures one hop per packet, RR allocates space in the header for nine IP addresses so that each router can record an address as long as space remains. Because RR can record nine routers traversed by a single packet, it can avoid artifacts that traceroute can introduce upon encountering a load balancer. Second, traceroute only measures the forward path from source to destination, whereas RR data in an ICMP Echo Request (ping) packet can be copied by the destination into its ICMP Echo Reply packet, and any empty slots can be filled on the reverse path from destination back to source. This mechanism forms the basis of our reverse traceroute system that can measure the reverse path back to any local host from a destination within range of at least one local host. Third, RR can capture some hops that are invisible to traceroute, such as routers that do not decrement TTL or routers inside tunnels with certain configurations.

To be clear, RR is not a replacement for traceroute, rather it can complement traceroute. The two tools can be used in combination to augment our understanding of network topology, a topic both explored in previous work and open to future study.

The conventional wisdom overemphasizes the drawbacks. Based on informal conversations with colleagues, we believe that the title of the 2005 technical report—“IP Options are not an option”—led to the unintended interpretation that IP Options were not a good option for measurement, even though the contents of the report suggest the potential of RR for measurement. The goal of the report was to assess whether IP Options could be used to provide IP extensibility, and the high fraction of paths that dropped Options packets means that they are not a general vehicle for supporting Internet-wide end-to-end functionality. However, the study also found that, for 91% of the paths that dropped them, the drops occurred at the source or destination AS.

Reinterpreting this result in a measurement context, a host that can send RR packets without being filtered locally can likely reach most destinations that support the Option. Further, even if the packets are filtered somewhere along the path between the source and destination, they can potentially provide useful partial path measurements.

The drawbacks of Record Route may be diminishing as the Internet evolves. Given this potential as a measurement tool, we believe that recent trends motivate the need to reevaluate support for RR on the Internet. Increased peering means that parts of the Internet such as clouds and colocation facilities may be more richly interconnected. Vantage points in or near these locations may be able to reach many destinations within the nine-hop limit of Record Route. Large content and cloud providers have especially short paths and could use RR to measure the paths from end-users to their networks, which is necessary to improve performance.

**Goal:** Given the demonstrated advantages of Record Route, we reassess the coverage of Record Route support on today’s Internet. Since some trends suggest that coverage may have improved over time, we hope to show that Record Route is a widely-supported, useful measurement primitive; present approaches to mitigate some of its limitations; and thereby revise the conventional wisdom.

## 3. Results: Does the Internet Support Record Route?
Our measurements (explained in §3.1) reveal that the answer is often “yes.” The majority of destinations we probed respond to RR (§3.2), a large fraction of these destinations are within RR’s 9-hop limit of at least one of our vantage points (§3.3), and, over time, this fraction has increased (§3.4). We find no evidence of ASes that systematically forward packets without recording IP addresses (§3.5). Finally, the interconnectivity of large cloud providers suggests that they could achieve even better coverage with RR than our vantage points (§3.6).

### 3.1 Dataset, Methodology, and Terminology
The primary dataset we used for investigating the usefulness of Record Route is composed of results from two measurement studies. Each study sent probes to the same destination set, which included 1 IP address in each advertised BGP prefix collected by RouteViews on September 24, 2016. For each prefix, the set includes the address that was most responsive to previous ping probes. We conducted the first study during September 24–25, 2016, and sent one ping with the Record Route Option (henceforth: ping-RR) from 141 vantage points (VPs). The VPs included one randomly chosen machine at each operational PlanetLab (55) and M-Lab (86) site. We conducted the second study in early October 2016 and sent three pings (without any IP Options enabled) to each destination from one machine at USC. Both studies used scamper to send probes and sent 20 probes per second per machine. Section 4.1 explores the impact of probing rate.

We classify a destination as ping-responsive if we received a response to at least one of the three normal pings. We classify a destination as RR-responsive if at least one VP received a response to its ping-RR. An RR-responsive destination responds to a ping-RR with an ICMP Echo Reply that copies the Record Route option with any recorded IP addresses into the header of its response. We define a destination as RR-reachable from a given VP if a ping-RR sent from the VP arrives at the destination with empty slots available in the RR header. Sometimes, we refer to a destination as RR-reachable from our set of VPs, meaning that it is RR-reachable from at least one VP. For our analyses, we test if a destination is RR-reachable by observing if the destination IP address appears in the RR response header.
