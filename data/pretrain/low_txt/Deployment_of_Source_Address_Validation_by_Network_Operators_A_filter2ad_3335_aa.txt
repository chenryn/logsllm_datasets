## Abstract
IP spoofing, the practice of sending IP packets with a false source IP address, remains a primary attack vector for large-scale Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. To combat this, various interventions have been attempted to increase the adoption of source address validation (SAV) among network operators. This paper presents the first randomized control trial (RCT) to measure the effectiveness of different notification mechanisms on SAV deployment. We include new treatments using nudges and channels, which were previously untested in notification experiments. Our results reveal a disappointing reality: none of the notification treatments significantly improved SAV deployment compared to the control group. We explore the reasons behind these findings and report on a survey among operators to identify potential ways forward. Some operators indicate plans to deploy SAV and request better notification mechanisms, training, and support materials.

## 1. Introduction
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks continue to pose a significant challenge for network operators. In a 2019 survey by RIPE NCC, involving over 4,000 participants, DDoS was identified as the most critical security problem [1]. These attacks are increasing in size; for instance, in February 2020, Amazon Web Services experienced the largest DDoS attack to date, peaking at approximately 2.3 Tbps and lasting three days [2].

IP spoofing, which involves sending IP packets with a false source IP address, is a key enabler of large-scale DDoS attacks. It is used in amplification attacks, where an attacker forges the victim's IP address in requests sent to systems that act as amplifiers, such as DNS or Memcached servers. These systems respond with larger responses, congesting the victim's network. IP spoofing is also used in SYN flood attacks to obscure the origin of the attack traffic.

Paul Vixie, a renowned Internet Hall of Fame technologist, has highlighted the lack of enforcement of source-address validation (SAV) by most gateways as a major flaw in the Internet's architecture [4]. Over the past decade, efforts have been made to encourage network operators to adopt BCP38, a best current practice for SAV. BCP38 defines a method for routers to validate the source address of every outgoing packet, dropping those with invalid source addresses. According to the Spoofer project, around 25-32% of Autonomous Systems (ASes) tested have problematic or wholly lacking SAV adoption [7].

This leads to our main question: How can more operators be encouraged to adopt SAV? Previous studies on other security issues have shown that operators do respond to notifications about vulnerabilities or abuse in their networks, though to varying degrees [8]–[11]. For SAV, researchers from the Spoofer project reported that notifying operators boosted remediation rates by about 50% [7]. However, their findings were based on observational data, and they suggested that A/B testing would provide more reliable measurements.

In this paper, we present the first RCT to measure the impact of notifications on SAV remediation rates. We sent notifications to 2,320 network operators, a much larger sample than any previous study. We used misconfigured open resolvers as vantage points, a different technique from the volunteer-based Spoofer project [14]. Our design includes a control group, which no earlier SAV study has done. This reveals that the improvements observed in [7] might be incorrectly attributed to the interventions.

Our study is novel in several aspects. We test social and reciprocity nudges in the message design, private messages to operators, notifications to national CERTs, and geographically-organized Network Operator Group (NOG) mailing lists. We partnered with NIC.br, a leading Brazilian CERT, to deliver the treatment. We also conducted a survey among operators to interpret the findings and identify ways forward. 

Unfortunately, our study reveals a disappointing reality: none of the treatments, including those thought to be effective, showed any evidence of remediation compared to the control group. We did observe some remediation across all groups, including the control group, which explains why [7] reported an impact. Since they had no control group, they could not see that the remediation was not driven by the intervention. Our findings, while sobering, are important for correcting our understanding of these interventions and moving forward on this critical issue.

### A. Methods to Infer the Adoption of SAV
Previous work has proposed various methods to detect SAV adoption among network operators. These methods differ in the direction of filtering, whether they infer the presence or absence of SAV, and whether the measurements can be performed remotely or from inside the network under test.

The Spoofer project [7], [14], [20], [21] uses a client-server system based on volunteers who run client software from inside their networks to periodically send and receive packets with spoofed source IP addresses to test SAV for both inbound and outbound traffic.

Lone et al. [23] described a remote method using traceroute loops. When a packet is sent to a destination network with a routable but unallocated IP address space, it is forwarded back to the provider router, resulting in a loop. Such a packet should be dropped by the provider router if the source IP does not belong to the customer network. However, this method relies on routing misconfigurations, limiting its coverage.

Müller et al. [16] and Lichtblau et al. [17] passively analyzed inter-domain traffic at large inter-connection points (IXPs) to detect networks not deploying SAV. These methods face challenges such as analyzing noisy BGP data sources, AS relationship inference, and require collaboration with IXPs.

To detect the lack of SAV for outbound traffic, we implemented a different method that does not require volunteers for vantage points inside the tested network, allowing us to include a larger sample of operators in our study.

### B. Security Notification Experiments
Several studies have examined the effectiveness of notifications to operators of networks, websites, and DNS infrastructure. Cetin et al. [24] described how ISPs notified and quarantined customers running devices vulnerable to amplification DDoS attacks, achieving high remediation rates of around 87%.

Kührer et al. [22] sent notifications to network operators about open resolvers, achieving a 92% remediation rate for open NTP servers supporting monlist. They used various intermediaries, including national CERTs, NOCs, and the open NTP project, but did not compare the effectiveness of these channels.

Luckie et al. [7] notified network operators who had not implemented SAV, initially contacting them directly via WHOIS email addresses and subsequently sending monthly emails to NOGs. They observed a 48.2% remediation rate, with NOG notifications being twice as effective as private notifications.

Our work builds on the study by Luckie et al. [7], but we use a randomized control trial and a much larger sample. We also test the significance of interventions using nudges and the impact of sending notifications through national CERTs on remediations. Our technique to detect SAV via open resolvers has two advantages over Spoofer data: it does not require volunteers and allows for a larger sample size.
