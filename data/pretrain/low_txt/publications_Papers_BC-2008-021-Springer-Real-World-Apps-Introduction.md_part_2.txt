### 4. The Importance of Semantics for Organizations

In today's global business landscape, integration is a top priority for many European and international enterprises. The European Union, through the Seventh Framework Program, has invested over €200 million in research focused on inter-enterprise interoperability and semantics. Many organizations recognize that Semantic Web technologies are a promising solution to support cross-organizational cooperation, particularly for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) operating in dynamic environments. These technologies are increasingly seen as essential for resolving interoperability and integration issues in a world of ubiquitously interconnected systems, which vary in components, standards, data formats, and protocols.

Moreover, Semantic Web technologies can facilitate not only the discovery and integration of heterogeneous data but also enhance communication between individuals. Semantic inter-enterprise interoperability is crucial for the implementation of a knowledge-based economy, where networks of enterprises, especially SMEs, can leverage the unique characteristics of the European productive fabric—many small, highly specialized, and closely connected companies with a high degree of flexibility due to the widespread diffusion of knowledge and skilled personnel.

The future competitiveness of enterprises will depend significantly on their ability to rapidly establish and maintain virtual, networked enterprise structures. Novel technologies for interoperability within and between enterprises need to emerge to address a problem that has not been sufficiently addressed by the research community. Managing the semantics of business-to-business interactions is one of the most challenging tasks in integrated e-business value chains, and there is growing evidence that Semantic Web technology can mitigate these challenges.

### 4.1 Ontology Management Systems

In the previous section, we discussed how ontologies are a key technological innovation enabling inter-enterprises to establish dynamic working networks. To provide comprehensive management, it is necessary to support the entire lifecycle of inter-enterprise ontologies, including creation, storage, search, query, reuse, maintenance, and integration (Li, Thompson et al., 2003). Modern organizations are realizing that shared ontologies and understanding are fundamental for creating the next generation of networked inter- and intra-enterprises (Wache, Voegele et al., 2001). Shared understanding is the foundation for effective communication, coordination, and collaboration between people and interoperability between systems (Vernadat, 1993).

Interoperability is not only a concern for software applications and hardware platforms but also for human resources within an enterprise, including employees, managers, and other individuals. In the near future, an increasing range of inter-enterprise applications will require an Ontology Management System (OMS) to externalize ontological information for various purposes in a declarative manner. Such management systems provide ontology independence to applications and people, similar to how database management systems provide data independence. The primary objective of an OMS is to provide full and efficient control over management activities for ontological information by externalizing them from application programs.

One of the pragmatic challenges for OMS research is to create the missing technology pieces and integrate them with existing results from prior research to provide a holistic management system (Harrison and Chan, 2005). An OMS must address a wide range of problems, including ontology models, ontology base design, query languages, programming interfaces, query processing and optimization, federation of knowledge sources, caching and indexing, transaction support, distributed system support, and security support (Lee and Goodwin, 2005). An inter-enterprise ontology management system provides a mechanism to handle ontological information at an appropriate level of abstraction. By using programming interfaces and query languages, the OMS allows application programs to manipulate and query ontologies without needing to know their details or re-implement the semantics of standard ontology languages.

### 4.2 Challenges

Networked enterprises have made a wealth of information available to people worldwide through blogs, wikis, websites, collaborative and social networks, and other platforms. This has unleashed numerous resources and possibilities. However, the volume of information being generated and made available is overwhelming, and current software systems are not equipped to handle this. Enterprises are often unprepared for environments where such a large amount of information is generated annually. Since business success often depends on decision-makers having timely access to the right information and knowledge (Vernadat, 1993), there is a growing need for systems that can provide this knowledge. Given the increasing role of the internet in human and business activity and the exponential growth in the volume of available information, there will be a growing demand for infrastructures like OMS.

The challenge for inter-enterprises is that the sheer volume of content being generated makes it impossible for humans to follow. For example, Arcelor Mittal, the world’s leading steel company with 330,000 employees in more than 60 countries, produces high-quality flat steel products. To meet customer expectations, they must fulfill many technical demands, such as innovative and adequate product development, research process definition, excellent plant technology, suitable plant maintenance, good quality raw materials, suitable automation systems, and proper set points for control systems.

Arcelor Mittal employees, with different profiles, have gathered a vast amount of information and knowledge over the years, developing new products, designing and carrying out manufacturing processes, and investigating cause-and-effect relationships regarding quality defects and process disturbances. This knowledge is continuously formalized in various formats and applications, which often contribute to the extraction of new knowledge. Unfortunately, this information is often limited to a small circle of people or even to an individual. As a result, people frequently reinvent known relationships due to poor information exchange within the company or the departure of experienced individuals. The knowledge acquired and put into operation by these individuals in their everyday tasks should be extended and contrasted with that of other groups or enterprise entities operating in different contexts.

Search and taxonomies are not sufficient solutions. Search is inadequate because people and workgroups may not know what to search for. Relying solely on existing "top-down" taxonomies is also insufficient. If a taxonomy already exists, then projects and procedures for contributing to them should also exist. We are interested in discovering and mining emerging ideas, new projects, and thoughts within the organization and bringing together the team that can make them happen. This means we are interested in the "ontology of tomorrow," which has not yet been formally built.

### 5. The Contribution of This Edition

In this edition, "The Semantic Web: Real-World Applications," we faced two critical challenges: providing practical, state-of-the-art content for those eager to learn and offering a clear vision of the efforts required for the adoption of Semantic Web technologies in real-world contexts. We organized the book's content into six general pillars, each representing an area of Semantic Web technology exploitation:

- **Semantic Enterprises**
- **Finance and Government**
- **Healthcare and Life Sciences**
- **Education**
- **Business and Customer Management**
- **Enterprise Management and Security**

The twelve chapters of this edition contribute in three main directions:

1. **Highlight the Full Range of Business and Technological Issues**: The variety of contexts discussed (e.g., finance, health, government, and education) gives readers a comprehensive view of Semantic Web adoption, including methodological approaches, key business issues, technology and tool selection, change management, return on investment, and alignment with overall IT strategy.

2. **Provide a Comprehensive Discussion of Semantic Web and Business Strategy Integration**: The presented applications, systems, projects, cases, and implementations help readers understand the "business" perspective of the Semantic Web, ontological engineering, semantic exploitation, semantic web services, semantic search engines, semantic interoperability and integration, enterprise application integration, enterprise information systems, and semantic portals. Successful technology and application adoption within organizations require business champions, alignment with business strategy, and justification of return on investment.

3. **Set a Context for Critical Thinking**: Each chapter challenges readers to explore their knowledge in relation to practical issues faced in real-world applications. This edition goes beyond the academic flavor of most scholarly editions, building incrementally a reader's awareness and expertise in the Semantic Web with great potential.

### 6. Next Milestones

We are pleased to announce the publication of this edition after many months of preparation. We look forward to your comments, ideas, and suggestions for improvement in future versions. In the meantime, we are planning a new reference edition on the role of the Semantic Web in realizing close-to-market business strategies.
