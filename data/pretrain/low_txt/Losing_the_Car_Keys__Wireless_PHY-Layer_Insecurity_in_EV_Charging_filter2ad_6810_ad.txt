### 9.1 Unencrypted Communications

During our testing campaign, we captured the initialization of charging sessions and examined the Network Management Key (NMK) exchange to form a network. In accordance with the ISO 15118 standard, all SLAC (Signal Level Attenuation Characterization) interactions we observed were conducted in an insecure manner. Consequently, the NMK was transmitted in plaintext, and the only barrier to acquiring it was receiving the message intact. We successfully intercepted the CM SLAC MATCH.CNF message in 31 cases, thereby obtaining the NMK. In a side-by-side test of two vehicles, the attacker was able to extract the NMK for one vehicle in four sessions and for both vehicles in one session.

In nine instances, we also recovered the subsequent CM GET KEY.CNF message, which allowed us to obtain the ephemeral Network Encryption Key (NEK) and passively decrypt physical-layer traffic. Upon examining compromised sessions, we observed the expected behavior as the vehicle and charger established a network, the vehicle initiated the discovery protocol to find a charge controller, and the two entities established a TCP connection. No TLS tunnel was established in any of the charging sessions we observed, leaving high-level protocols exposed. While the use of TLS is optional under ISO 15118 when external authorization is employed, its complete absence from all tested vehicles and chargers, especially in public charging locations, was surprising.

Our findings confirm that a passive attacker can wirelessly monitor all traffic at the PHY layer, and this vulnerability stems from standards-compliant behavior, suggesting it is persistent. Additionally, the option to forego TLS means that charging data remains unsecured. We discuss this situation and its implications in Section 10.

### 9.2 Private Data

Figure 10 provides a breakdown of potential data available when eavesdropping under various charging conditions or in the presence of different services. The PHY-layer traffic is always accessible and permits access to any higher-level communication, such as charging or internet access, that does not take additional steps to secure itself. Two unique identifiers, EVID and EV MAC, can be obtained, allowing an attacker to monitor all PHY traffic, perform contract-based identification, and engage in external authorization. Standard charging allows the attacker to learn the state-of-charge and charge rate, while reactive charging reveals projected departure times and tariff preferences. V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) monitoring discloses power usage of the vehicle and building. Alternative payment methods can reveal payment provider details or transaction details for open blockchain payments. Additional services may expose service use and internet activity.

### Vehicle Identifiers

We were able to obtain the identifiers in 41 cases (76%) from various locations, including the two-car arrangement shown in Figure 8. Here, the identifiers for both vehicles were acquired from the same antenna position, indicating that an attacker could park next to a charging station and collect identifiers as other users arrive, subsequently using them to obtain free charging on another user's account. As the charging spots are operated by a single provider, the attacker can be confident of targeting valid customers.

### User Tracking

In the simplest attack, charging sessions can be linked by monitoring a number of busy public chargers for the appearance of vehicle identifiers. From the time of day, charge duration, and location information, behavioral profiles can be inferred. The invasiveness of the attack increases if the attacker can match a vehicle identity to other data. Popular charger-sharing schemes allow anyone to register their home or business charger as a public site, enabling any user booking to charge to be associated with their vehicle identifier and tracked at any monitored station. Monitoring a charger near a sensitive event, such as a union meeting, protest gathering, or compromising night-spot, would reveal more personal information about an individual's habits.

With a wireless attack, a wardriving approach also allows an attacker to associate a vehicle with a street address. This could easily be conducted by a delivery driver or postal worker as they visit properties regularly. Known MAC allocations to manufacturers provide a coarse-grained indication of the vehicle type, such as identifying expensive vehicles and determining when they have been left in a public car park or when their owner is out of the house.

### 10 Lessons Learnt

The refinement of EV charging systems is still ongoing. Based on our observations, we have distilled a set of security lessons that can improve existing and future designs.

#### 10.1 Wireless Threats

The most notable finding is that the design of CCS (Combined Charging System) communication allows a wireless attacker to observe it at a distance without prior interaction or tampering. In this case, the attack was entirely passive but has similar implications for the potential of active attacks, which would currently be far more invasive. Given the recent history of attacks on in-vehicle wireless systems, our results indicate that a testing model considering emissions security and unwanted interference is crucial for future development.

#### 10.2 Reliance on a Non-Existent PKI

The ISO 15118 security model, and thus that of CCS, relies on the existence of a complex Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to underpin TLS at the Transport Layer and XML Security for external message values at the Application Layer. The merits of this infrastructure are an ongoing topic of academic study, but its complexity presents a practical problem. At the time of writing, no widespread ISO 15118 PKI is deployed. While small-scale pilots have been attempted, there is still open debate about the provision of the infrastructure. There are public proposals from three different commercial entities to provide transaction brokerage and act as the Root Certification Authority. There is even disagreement about the model the PKI will take; whether it will derive from a single root of trust, a consortium of trusted entities, or some more open model. Meanwhile, the competing pressures to provide new functionality remain, spurring alternative solutions such as AutoCharge and encouraging service development without underlying security provision.

Even once a PKI is operating for public chargers in large charging networks, it remains unclear to what extent private units in individual homes or offices will benefit. A capacity for self-signed contract certificates to be manually installed into vehicles by users does exist, but unless contract-based billing is used, ISO 15118 exempts charging installations from any security requirements, relying instead on the physical security of the location and cabling, which we have demonstrated to be insufficient. Manufacturer choices and user willingness will determine whether private chargers can enjoy these security benefits.

It is important, therefore, to provide at least some security implementation that is decoupled from the need for access to a PKI. We discuss such an approach in Section 11.

#### 10.3 Available PHY Security Disabled

The HomePlug GreenPHY (HPGP) PLC technology supports a Secure SLAC mode that protects the pairing and NMK distribution process, but this is disabled by specification in the ISO 15118 standard, relying instead on TLS for all security properties. While this can meet the charging use cases outlined in that standard, it leaves an opportunity for a pervasive security baseline completely ignored, despite proposing the communication channel for general use. History has shown that leaving security to individual developers atop insecure platforms produces widespread security problems, even more so when the channel is considered physically private.

### 11 Countermeasures

To mitigate the unintended wireless channel, familiar emissions security mechanisms such as chokes or shielding can be applied to reduce leakage, although hardware modifications for existing systems are costly and time-consuming. Some proposals for future, high-power chargers include liquid-cooled charging cables, which we expect to attenuate the signals if the cooling jacket wraps the communication lines as well as the power-delivery ones. However, this would not eliminate emissions from the vehicle or charger circuitry, nor is it likely to exist in smaller, private chargers.

At a network level, we have argued for the use of the available HPGP security mechanisms, but note that in their present form, they are still reliant on a PKI to function. Additionally, the HPGP key distribution behavior itself introduces an unnecessary risk of interception. Whether the SLAC protocol operates in its secure mode or not, it is still unilateral: the charger generates a network key and then provides it to the vehicle. However, the SLAC process is typically implemented in software by the same devices that undertake the higher-level ISO 15118 communication, including possible TLS sessions, and as such require the capabilities for an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key derivation for AES128.

We propose additional steps in the SLAC initialization, as a fallback to provide confidentiality from the MAC-layer upwards in the event that PKI access is unavailable. Figure 11 shows the modified protocol. Upon receiving a network match request, the charger generates an Elliptic-Curve key-pair (dC, QC) and instructs the vehicle to commence a key exchange, along with QC. If the vehicle also supports the protocol, it generates (dV, QV) and responds with QV. The derived key becomes the new NMK, and the charger blanks the NMK field in the subsequent CM SLAC MATCH.CNF message. If the vehicle does not support the protocol, the unrecognized message will be dropped. The charger maintains a timeout counter after step 6.1 and, upon expiry, falls back to the existing protocol’s step 7.

While this approach cannot provide authentication and therefore cannot mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks, it eliminates the threat of passive eavesdropping. By building only on existing functionality, the protocol is deployable in existing vehicles as well as new ones.

### 12 Conclusion

We have demonstrated that the use of PLC in EV charging and the design of the CCS standard lead to a uniquely high-quality, unintentional wireless channel. We evaluated the susceptibility of real-world chargers and found a reliable channel in every case. Although conditions vary substantially between sites, for eavesdropping, we achieved a peak successful recovery rate of 100% in one case and could intercept traffic several meters from the target, in a different parking bay, with a rate of 91.8%. We showed how a series of further design choices allow the recovery of network keys and passive monitoring of all traffic in plaintext. We presented lessons learned and potential improvements to mitigate these problems so that they do not hinder the secure adoption of global EV charging infrastructure by the growing number of EV owners worldwide.
