### Figure 5: Histogram of zxcvbn Password Strength for Breached and Remediated Passwords
The histogram in Figure 5 illustrates the distribution of zxcvbn password strength scores for passwords detected as breached and the new passwords adopted by users after receiving our warnings. The data shows a clear trend towards stronger passwords, with 39% of new passwords achieving the highest possible strength score (up from just 3% in the original set). This significant improvement suggests an increasing use of password managers that automatically generate strong passwords. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of providing actionable security information in mitigating the risk of account hijacking.

### 6.2 Influence of Domains on Account Security

#### Category Analysis
We examined whether the perceived value of an account influences the rate at which users rely on reused, breached credentials. To do this, we manually categorized the top 332 domains that received more than 5,000 logins during our measurement period into one of thirteen categories (e.g., finance, email and messaging, social networking). We used a catch-all "Other" category for domains that did not fit into these specific categories. Combined, logins to these domains accounted for 41% of lookups against our API.

Table 4 presents a breakdown of the aggregate warning rates and ignore rates across all domains per category. Financial and government-related domains exhibited the lowest rate of reused, breached credentials (0.2–0.3%). This may be due to strict password composition policies, user adherence to security advice, or active breach detection and forced password resets. In contrast, entertainment sites, such as streaming video platforms and adult websites, had the highest warning rates for breached credentials (3.6–6.3%). Users may adopt disposable passwords for these sites due to a perceived lower risk, or, in the case of streaming sites, they may use shared accounts. Surprisingly, users ignored our breach warnings nearly uniformly across categories, with the exception of adult websites, where users ignored nearly twice as many warnings—potentially to hide the domain from our persistent warning tray (see Figure 3 earlier).

#### Popularity Analysis
We also investigated whether more popular sites are less vulnerable to credential stuffing. Figure 6 shows a Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of the frequency of warnings per domain versus the volume of logins. We found that only 6% of domains with 10,000+ logins had a warning rate higher than 3%, compared to 15% of domains with fewer than 10,000 logins. This disparity in security is likely due to larger investments in security by popular domains, including proactive password resets and measures to help users avoid weak passwords. While large identity providers can benefit from our API, addressing the long tail of domains affected by credential stuffing may require in-browser warnings.

#### Account Hijacking Threats
Credential stuffing is just one dimension of account hijacking threats. Other risks include large-scale phishing [7, 51], credential or token theft from local machines [50], and targeted attacks [35, 40]. Users have internalized these risks and adopted a security model of joint responsibility between themselves and identity providers [47]. Prominent solutions include two-factor authentication and expanded authentication methods, such as passive factors like device and location [12, 17]. The protections proposed in this work complement a defense-in-depth authentication model, where breach detection serves as an additional risk factor.

#### Password Reuse Behaviors
Text passwords remain the primary mechanism for online authentication. Given the human constraints of memorizing multiple unique text strings, people often resort to password reuse and weak patterns [18, 23, 49, 55]. Florencio and Herley's study [16] found that both weak and reused passwords were common. More recent studies by Wash et al. [56] and Pearman et al. [44] observed that 32% of entered passwords involved exact reuse, with users reusing their most popular password on an average of 9 sites. Das et al. [10] found that 43–51% of users reused the same password on multiple sites. Although automated password filling has become more common, password managers are not widely used for password generation. These factors exacerbate the threat of credential stuffing, where cracking a single weak password can provide access to multiple sites.

#### Improving Breach Alerting Protocols
In a contemporaneous work, Li et al. [33] presented a framework for reasoning about leakages resulting from password-based prefixes used by our protocol and HaveIBeenPwned. They demonstrated how a password-only prefix (or an attacker with access to the plaintext username in a username-password prefix) can leverage the underlying password distribution to reduce the number of guesses needed to learn a user's password. To address this, the authors outlined a zero-password leakage variant using private set membership and a username hash prefix, similar to our model in Section 3.2. Their work further motivates the need for a zero-password leakage protocol, despite its additional computational complexity.

### 8 Conclusion
In this paper, we demonstrated the feasibility of a privacy-preserving protocol that allows clients to query whether their login credentials were exposed in a breach without revealing the queried information. Our protocol combines computationally expensive hashing, k-anonymity, and private set intersection. It improves on existing protocols by considering both adversarial clients and servers while minimizing false positives. We envision this service being used by end-users, password managers, and identity providers. As a proof-of-concept, we created a cloud service that mediates access to 4 billion usernames and passwords publicly exposed by breaches. We also released a Chrome extension that queries credentials entered at login time against our service. Based on telemetry from nearly 670,000 users, we estimated that 1.5% of web credentials are vulnerable to credential stuffing (based on a sample of 21 million logins).

Addressing this problem requires action from both users and identity providers. In our study, 26% of warnings for breached passwords resulted in users adopting a new password, with 94% of these new passwords being stronger or as strong as the original. The high volume of user interest and response rate indicate a willingness among users to secure their accounts from credential stuffing. By making our protocol public, we hope other researchers can improve on the privacy protections, computational bounds, and cost models we established. Our protocol is a first step in democratizing access to breach alerting to mitigate one dimension of account hijacking.
