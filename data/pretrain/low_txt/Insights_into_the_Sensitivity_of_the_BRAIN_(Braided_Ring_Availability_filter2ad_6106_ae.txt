### Figure 6: Normalized Reliability Dependent on Link Failure Rate

### Figure 8: Normalized Reliability Dependent on the Number of Self-Checking Pairs and Clique Startup

Protocols such as self-checking clock synchronization and aggregation, when deployed on a ring network, are easily extensible. This extensibility is crucial for enhancing reliability performance. As shown in Figure 8, deploying only one self-checking pair significantly influences the system's safety. However, as the number of self-checking pairs increases, the impact of a single pair failure on the overall system reliability diminishes. For three and four pairs, the reliability numbers are nearly identical.

While two neighboring nodes can be paired to provide self-checking protocol functionality without causing a swamping effect, losing hardware due to failures equivalent to more than two self-checking pair failures is likely to result in a critical state for redundancy-constrained applications, such as those in the automotive domain. It is noteworthy that one or two self-checking pairs are insufficient for achieving optimal platform dependability.

### 5.6. Sensitivity to Service Interval Time

This paper argues that latent faults can only be removed during car servicing, which typically occurs every 150 hours. Alternatively, techniques could be employed to perform sufficient testing more frequently, such as after each trip (e.g., when the car electronics are powered down). Similar self-test methods are used in aerospace systems, and if independent devices self-test with adequate error detection coverage, the "vulnerability" window can be drastically reduced. The low service interval numbers of 0.5 or 1 hour model these alternative approaches.

Historically, a car's operational life was approximately 4000 hours [28]. Today, some manufacturers aim for even longer lifespans, approaching 6000 hours. Long service intervals highlight the effects if no latent fault detection (scrubbing) is performed during the vehicle's lifetime. Such long intervals may also account for silicon wear-out effects [21], as the failure rate may no longer be constant. With the loss of constant failure rates, the "memory-less" properties of failure rates disappear, and the actual age of the electronics becomes a significant factor.

### Figure 9: Normalized Reliability Dependent on Service Interval

Figure 9 illustrates some of the platform-level effects. As expected, the safety is largely independent of service intervals in the "immediate repair" scenario. The BRAIN system has perfect fault detection properties due to its bit-for-bit comparison for platform communication, explaining the observed outcomes.

For all scenarios except "no repair," the safety levels stabilize (or remain nearly constant) from a 50-hour service interval onwards. Once a failure occurs, another failure within the interval to the next service is unlikely. In the "no repair" scenario, the safety decreases at a higher rate, and dependability diminishes with increasing service time, reflecting the propensity for faults when the platform is not scrubbed for latent faults and the "reliability clocks" of components are not reset. Similar behavior might be observed with aging silicon [21].

### 6. Conclusions

The results presented in this paper demonstrate the benefits of the BRAIN's hybrid behavior, which includes the added 'skip' integrity and availability augmentation. The full coverage of high-integrity data propagation in the BRAIN offers a significant improvement over the inline error coverage of dual-star architectures. The half-duplex BRAIN also exhibits slightly better overall reliability, with fewer components and similar connectivity requirements. Our analysis indicates that extended operation with a fault is possible with certain configurations of the BRAIN architecture.

Extended operation with a dual-star configuration also shows promise for x-by-wire systems. However, the sensitivity of the star architecture to the quality of inline error-detection mechanisms has been highlighted. Augmenting this with improved, higher-level diagnosis functions, such as error strike counters, may considerably enhance system dependability. Introducing strike counters into the BRAIN could also increase system dependability, and refining such strike-counting policies will be the subject of future work. Over-zealous indictment must be carefully managed to reduce the risk of resource exhaustion from transient errors.

Finally, it is important to note that this work assumes a constant failure rate for the electronic components examined. As technology improvements, such as decreasing geometries and the associated vulnerabilities of silicon wear-outs [21], are considered, some of the assumptions underlying the reliability assessment may need to be revisited. Assessing reliability under these conditions may pose a considerable challenge. However, the full coverage and fault detection provided by architectures like BRAIN may help mitigate these effects.

Similarly, frequent and regular service intervals for testing automotive electronics may not be acceptable to customers, as the prevention of component failures may not be perceived as an immediate added value to passenger safety. The model in this paper could be extended to include more frequent self-test diagnostics (e.g., at power-down), which typically achieve less error detection coverage but may result in higher safety numbers for similar service intervals.
