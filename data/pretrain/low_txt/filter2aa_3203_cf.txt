### Troubleshooting Routing and Remote Access

When troubleshooting Routing and Remote Access, check the following configurations:

- **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Snap-in:**
  - Active connection security rules.
- **IP Security Monitor Snap-in:**
  - Active IPsec policies.
- **Routing and Remote Access Snap-in:**
  - IPv4 packet filters on routing interfaces.
  - NAT/Basic Firewall routing protocol component.

For intermediate IPv4 routers or firewalls from third-party hardware vendors, verify:
- Packet filters (also known as access lists).
- IPsec policies and filters.

On the destination node running Windows, check:
- **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Snap-in:**
  - Active connection security rules.
- **IP Security Monitor Snap-in:**
  - Active IPsec policies.
- Whether Internet Connection Firewall or Windows Firewall is enabled.
- TCP/IP filtering.

For nodes running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003 with Routing and Remote Access, also check:
- **Routing and Remote Access Snap-in:**
  - IPv4 packet filters on routing interfaces.
  - NAT/Basic Firewall routing protocol component.
- Whether Internet Connection Firewall or Windows Firewall is enabled.
- TCP/IP filtering.

For more information about IPsec and packet filtering components, refer to Chapter 13, "Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) and Packet Filtering."

### Managing the Local IPv4 Routing Table

If you cannot reach a local or remote destination, it may be due to incorrect or missing routes in the IPv4 routing table. To view the IPv4 routing table, use the `route print` or `netstat -r` commands. Ensure that you have a route for your local subnet and, if a default gateway is configured, a default route. If multiple default routes with the same lowest metric exist, modify your IPv4 configuration to have only one default route, using the interface connected to the network with the largest number of subnets (e.g., the Internet).

To manage the IPv4 routing table, use the following commands:
- Add a route: `route add`
- Modify an existing route: `route change`
- Remove an existing route: `route delete`

### Verifying Router Reliability

If you suspect router performance issues, use the `pathping -d <IPv4Address>` command to trace the route a packet takes to a destination and display information on packet losses for each router and link in the path. The `-d` option prevents DNS reverse queries, speeding up the display of the routing path.

### Verifying DNS Name Resolution for IPv4 Addresses

If reachability using IPv4 addresses works but not with host names, you may have a problem with host name resolution, typically related to DNS client configuration or DNS registration issues.

To troubleshoot DNS name resolution:
- **Verify DNS Configuration:**
  - Host name
  - Primary DNS suffix
  - DNS suffix search list
  - Connection-specific DNS suffixes
  - DNS servers
  - Use `ipconfig /all` to obtain this information.
  - Use `netsh interface ip show dns` to see which DNS names should be registered.
  - Use `ipconfig /registerdns` to register appropriate DNS names as A resource records.

- **Display and Flush the DNS Client Resolver Cache:**
  - Display cache: `ipconfig /displaydns`
  - Flush cache: `ipconfig /flushdns`

- **Test DNS Name Resolution with Ping:**
  - Use `ping <hostname>` or `ping <FQDN>` to test DNS name resolution.
  - Use `ping -4 <hostname>` to force IPv4 address usage.

- **Use Nslookup to View DNS Server Responses:**
  - At the Nslookup prompt, use `set d2` to display detailed DNS response messages.
  - Look for A records in the detailed display.

### Verifying NetBIOS Name Resolution

If reachability using IPv4 addresses works but not with NetBIOS names, you may have a problem with NetBIOS over TCP/IP configuration or WINS registration.

To troubleshoot NetBIOS name resolution:
- **Verify NetBT Configuration:**
  - NetBIOS computer name
  - NetBIOS node type
  - Primary and secondary WINS servers
  - Whether NetBIOS over TCP/IP is disabled
  - Use `ipconfig /all` to obtain this information.
  - Use `nbtstat -c` to display the NetBIOS scope ID assigned to each interface.
  - Check the WINS tab in the advanced properties of the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component.

- **Display and Reload the NetBIOS Name Cache:**
  - Display cache: `nbtstat -c`
  - Flush cache: `nbtstat -R`

- **Test NetBIOS Name Resolution with Nbtstat:**
  - Use `nbtstat -a <ComputerName>` to display the NetBIOS name table of a remote computer.
  - Use `nbtstat -RR` to release and re-register the NetBIOS names in WINS.

### Verifying IPv4-based TCP Sessions

If reachability and name resolution are working but you cannot establish a TCP session with a destination host, perform the following tasks:

- **Check for Packet Filtering:**
  - Verify packet filtering at the source node, intermediate routers, and the destination node.
  - Use the information in the "Verifying IPv4 Communications" section to check for packet filtering or IPsec policies.

- **Verify TCP Session Establishment:**
  - Use `telnet <IPv4Address> <TCPPort>` to test TCP connections.
  - For example, `telnet 131.107.78.12 80` to test the Web server service.
  - Use Port Query (Portqry.exe or Portqueryui.exe) or Test TCP (Ttcp) for additional testing.

- **Verify NetBIOS Sessions:**
  - Use `nbtstat -s` to display the NetBIOS session table.

### Troubleshooting IPv6

The following sections describe tools and techniques for identifying problems in the TCP/IP protocol stack using an IPv6 Internet layer. Depending on the problem, you may start at the bottom or top of the stack.

#### Verifying IPv6 Connectivity

To troubleshoot IPv6 connectivity issues:
- **Verify Configuration:**
  - Use `ipconfig /all` to check current IPv6 settings.
  - Use `netsh interface ipv6 show address` to display IPv6 addresses.
  - Use `netsh -r <RemoteComputerName> interface ipv6 show address` to display the configuration of a remote computer.

- **Manage Configuration:**
  - Manually configure IPv6 addresses: `netsh interface ipv6 set address`
  - Make changes to IPv6 interfaces: `netsh interface ipv6 set interface`
  - Add DNS servers: `netsh interface ipv6 add dns`
  - Manage remote configurations: `netsh -r <RemoteComputerName>`

- **Verify Reachability:**
  - **Check and Flush the Neighbor Cache:**
    - Display neighbor cache: `netsh interface ipv6 show neighbors`
    - Flush neighbor cache: `netsh interface ipv6 delete neighbors`
  - **Check and Flush the Destination Cache:**
    - Display destination cache: `netsh interface ipv6 show destinationcache`
    - Flush destination cache: `netsh interface ipv6 delete destinationcache`
  - **Ping the Default Router:**
    - Use `ping <IPv6Address>` to ping the default router.
    - Obtain the link-local IPv6 address from `ipconfig`, `netsh interface ipv6 show routes`, `route print`, or `nbtstat -r`.
    - Specify the zone identifier (ID) for the interface.
  - **Ping a Remote Destination by Its IPv6 Address:**
    - Use `ping <IPv6Address>` to test reachability.
  - **Trace the Route to the Remote Destination:**
    - Use `tracert <IPv6Address>` to trace the route.

This comprehensive guide should help you effectively troubleshoot and resolve various TCP/IP and IPv6 connectivity issues.
