### Appendix B: Codebook

In this appendix, we provide the codebook used to categorize organizer decisions for not fully implementing reviewed pedagogical principles.

- **Does not fit our goals:** The organizer considered implementing the dimension but chose not to because it did not fit within the structure and intended goals of the exercise.
- **Challenging:** The organizers considered implementing the dimension but decided that implementation would be too difficult.

### Analysis Review

Moving on to our review of your exercise, I will now go through each core pedagogical principle and its dimensions. For each, I will provide our definition and our decision, and then seek your response.

For each core principle and related dimension, we provided the interviewee with the textual definitions given throughout Section III. For each dimension coded as "No" or "Partial," we explained the reasoning behind our decision and asked the following question progression:

1. **Do you agree?**
   - If no: Why not?
   - If yes: Do you agree that this pedagogical dimension would be helpful to students if implemented?
     - If no: Why not?
     - If yes: Why did you choose not to implement it?
       - If they said it was too difficult: What are the challenges?

This structured approach ensures a thorough and consistent review of each pedagogical principle and its implementation.
