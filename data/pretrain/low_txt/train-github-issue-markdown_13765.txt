The support for lifecycle interface implementations in superclasses, as mentioned in issue #4222, is already available. It would be beneficial to extend this support to include `@Input()`, `@Output()`, and `@HostBinding()` decorators. This enhancement would facilitate the creation of reusable implementations, similar to behaviors in Polymer, thereby improving code maintainability and reusability.
