### North Korea's IT Education and Cyber Capabilities

North Korea operates an elite IT school known as the Kumsong Computer School, which admits 100 male students as young as 8 years old each year. These students are selected to study computer programming and English. While they are not allowed to play games or access the Internet, they can use instant messaging within the school. A Western journalist reported that the school uses Taiwanese hardware and Microsoft software.

According to the South Korean Chief of Military Intelligence, top graduates from the Kim Il-Sung Military Academy are recruited into a state-sponsored hacker unit. They are allegedly tasked with developing "cyber-terror" military options under direct orders from Kim Jong-Il. North Korea's intelligence collection is considered fairly sophisticated, with a focus on South Korea, the United States, and Japan.

### Internet Infrastructure and Control

Internet connections in North Korea are routed through Moscow and Beijing via the Korea Computer Centre (KCC), established in 1990. The KCC serves as the government's IT hub, providing a limited and controlled amount of research and development information to a select few clients. The official stance of the government is that it cannot tolerate an influx of "spiritual pollution," but North Korea has been caught operating a state-run "cyber casino" using a South Korean IP address. Since this discovery, South Korean companies have been required to register North Korean sites only with government approval.

### Notes from the Underground: Cyber Control and Resistance

Technology evolves faster than any government bureaucracy, and the Internet changes every second. Activists post messages on new websites daily, staying one step ahead of government censors. While basic cyber attacks may be prevented, more sophisticated ones often go undetected. Underground sources are providing software that could potentially bring down the government.

The Internet thrives on the open exchange of information. As the world becomes more connected, the challenge is to turn better communication into more power for the common person. Human rights battles will continue, but time is on the side of those who seek freedom. If the government continues to restrict Internet development, it will ultimately lead to economic and state collapse.

### The Role of the Internet in Freedom

The Internet has done more for the cause of freedom than any other technology, benefiting both activists and ordinary citizens. Traditional media, such as the printing press and radio, are more susceptible to government control. However, there are still significant challenges. Reports from Minsk indicate that there are no easy solutions, and negotiations should push for transparency. The government must explain its actions and motivations clearly.

Be skeptical of everything you see online, especially during key events like elections. Verifying information from multiple sources is crucial. In cyberspace, finding the truth is ten times harder than in the real world.

### Tools for Resistance

To avoid government subversion, revolutionary cadres are studying various strategies to provide both information and anonymity. Some basic tools include:

- Direct access to foreign ISPs
- Telephone, web, and satellite communications
- Anonymous email correspondence (remailers, RSS mailer)
- Anonymous web browsing (P2P, proxy servers, encryption)
- Dead drops in cyberspace
- Steganography
- Covert channels
- Normal activity at unusual times
- Common hacker tools
- Out-of-the-box thinking
- Saving text as pictures

A recent tool, Psiphon, allows users in free countries to share their internet connection with those in censored environments. This type of communication is difficult for governments to target and decipher.

### The Future

Our understanding of world affairs and human rights is growing, particularly in the Internet era. In the future, it may be impossible to enslave or fool millions of people. Mastering the Internet is crucial for our liberation.

While the government has advantages in brute force and technology, it is also constrained by the limits of these technologies. Be suspicious of Internet outages and consider whether the government is targeting the population or specific individuals. Always verify the information you seek and question whether it is being withheld by the government.
