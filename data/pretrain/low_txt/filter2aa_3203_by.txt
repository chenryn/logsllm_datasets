### Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) with IPsec

Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) in conjunction with IPsec, commonly referred to as L2TP/IPsec, is described in RFC 3193. For more detailed information on Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), please refer to Chapter 13, "Internet Protocol Security and Packet Filtering."

**Figure 14-5: Encryption of L2TP Traffic Using IPsec with ESP**

### Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP)

Both Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) and L2TP/IPsec can encounter issues when traversing firewalls, network address translators (NATs), and web proxies. The Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP), introduced in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista Service Pack 1, addresses these connectivity problems by using HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL is also known as Transport Layer Security (TLS). HTTP over SSL, typically used on TCP port 443 for secure web transactions like credit card processing, is generally allowed through most firewalls, NATs, and web proxies.

When you connect to a web address that starts with `https:`, you are using HTTP over SSL. This method resolves many VPN protocol connectivity issues because standard network security devices allow this type of traffic.

SSTP establishes an HTTP-over-SSL session between the VPN client and server to exchange encapsulated IPv4 or IPv6 packets. It is important to note that an HTTP-over-SSL-based remote access VPN connection is distinct from the connection made by an application that uses HTTP over SSL. For example, Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to access your Microsoft Exchange email over the Internet using an HTTP over SSL-encrypted session, but this is not the same as a remote access connection. While OWA enables you to view your email, it does not provide access to intranet URLs embedded within Exchange email messages.

Unlike PPTP and L2TP/IPsec, SSTP does not support site-to-site VPN connections.

**Figure 14-6: Structure of SSTP Packets**

An IPv4 or IPv6 packet is first encapsulated with a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) header and an SSTP header. The combined packet, including the IPv4 or IPv6 packet, PPP header, and SSTP header, is then encrypted by the SSL session. A TCP header and an IPv4 or IPv6 header (depending on the Internet version) are added to complete the packet.

### Remote Access VPN Connections

Both Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP include a remote access VPN client and server.

#### VPN Client Support

Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2003 come with a built-in VPN client that supports PPTP and L2TP/IPsec. Additionally, the VPN clients in Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008 support SSTP. You can configure a remote access VPN connection using either the Network Connections folder or Connection Manager.

##### Network Connections Folder

For a small number of clients, you can manually configure each VPN connection. In Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008, use the "Set up a connection or network" task in the Network and Sharing Center. Follow the "Connect to a workplace" wizard to create the VPN connection.

For clients running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003, use the New Connection Wizard in the Network Connections folder. Select "Connect to the network at my workplace" and choose "Virtual Private Network connection."

##### Connection Manager

Manually configuring remote access VPN connections for thousands of clients in an enterprise can be challenging due to varying procedures across different Windows versions, potential configuration errors, and the need for double-dial configurations. To simplify this process, you can use the following components:

- **Connection Manager**: A client dialer with advanced features.
- **Connection Manager Administration Kit (CMAK)**: Tools for customizing the appearance and behavior of connections.
- **Connection Point Services (CPS)**: Automatic creation, distribution, and updating of custom phone books.

**Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking**
**TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows**
**Page: 413**

CMAK allows you to tailor the appearance and behavior of a connection, enabling the development of client dialer and connection software that provides only the necessary connection features. CMAK supports various features that simplify and enhance the deployment of connection support for both administrators and users.

CPS consists of two components:
1. **Phone Book Administrator**: A tool for creating and maintaining the phone book database and publishing new phone book information to the Phone Book Service.
2. **Phone Book Service**: An Internet Information Services (IIS) extension that automatically checks and updates subscribers' or corporate employees' current phone books.

#### VPN Server Support

Using Routing and Remote Access in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003, you can configure a VPN server that supports PPTP, L2TP/IPsec, and, for Windows Server 2008, SSTP.

**Configuring a Windows Server 2008 as a VPN Server:**
1. Configure a static IPv4 address on each intranet interface.
2. Open Server Manager and add the Network Policy and Access Services role.
3. Use the Routing and Remote Access snap-in to configure the server as a VPN server.

**Configuring a Windows Server 2003 as a VPN Server:**
1. Configure a static IPv4 address on each intranet interface.
2. Open the Routing and Remote Access service and configure the server as a VPN server.
3. Set up DHCP relay if needed.

**TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows**

#### IP Address Assignment and Routing and Remote Access

The VPN server can obtain IPv4 addresses for clients from a DHCP server or a static pool of IPv4 addresses. These addresses can be on-subnet or off-subnet, which affects reachability and routing infrastructure.

- **On-subnet address range**: Addresses from the intranet subnet to which the VPN server is attached. No changes to the routing infrastructure are required.
- **Off-subnet address range**: Addresses from a different subnet. Changes to the routing infrastructure are necessary to ensure reachability.

**Obtaining IPv4 Addresses via DHCP:**
- Routing and Remote Access obtains 10 IPv4 addresses at a time from the DHCP server.
- If the DHCP server is unreachable, APIPA addresses (169.254.0.0/16) are assigned, which are off-subnet and have no corresponding route by default.

**Obtaining IPv4 Addresses from a Static Address Pool:**
- Manually configured ranges of IPv4 addresses.
- Off-subnet addresses require additional routes in the intranet routing infrastructure.

### The Process for Setting Up a Remote Access VPN Connection

Creating a remote access VPN connection involves three main steps:

1. **Logical Link Setup:**
   - Establishes a point-to-point link between the client and server for sending PPP frames.
   - For PPTP, this involves a TCP connection to port 1723 and PPTP message exchanges.
   - For L2TP/IPsec, this involves IKE negotiations for IPsec SAs and L2TP message exchanges.

2. **PPP Connection Setup:**
   - Uses PPP protocols to negotiate link parameters, authenticate the user, and set up protocols over the PPP link.

3. **Remote Access VPN Client Registration:**
   - The client obtains additional configuration parameters and registers in DNS and WINS for name resolution.

**Step 1: Logical Link Setup**

- **PPTP-based connections:**
  1. The client initiates a TCP connection to the server's port 1723.
  2. PPTP messages are exchanged to establish a tunnel and call ID.

- **L2TP/IPsec-based connections:**
  1. IKE negotiates and creates IPsec SAs.
  2. L2TP messages are exchanged to establish a tunnel and call ID.
