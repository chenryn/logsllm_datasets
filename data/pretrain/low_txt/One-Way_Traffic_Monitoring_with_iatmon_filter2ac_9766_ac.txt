# Monitoring with iatmon

## 1. Introduction
Figure 3(c) illustrates the daily average hourly traffic volume (in GB) for different source types. TCP horizontal scan traffic constituted approximately half of the total volume, around 4 GB/h. UDP probe traffic decreased to about 0.2 GB/h, which is surprising given the increase in the number of UDP probe sources. Additionally, there was about 0.1 GB of UDP horizontal scan traffic each hour, despite the small number of UDP horizontal scan sources.

## 2. Source Group Activity
Figure 3(b) shows that short-lived sources dominate, accounting for about 75% of the observed sources. The number of stealth 3-second mode sources (TCP and UDP) steadily declined from 100 million to 30 million over six months, while the number of sources in other groups remained relatively stable. On January 12, we observed 78,000 stealth other sources, corresponding to a spike in TCP probes in Figure 3(a). Similarly, in the first week of April, there was an increase in stealth other sources, aligning with a rise in UDP probes. Traffic volumes for the source groups are shown in Figure 3(d). Although the lower four bands on the plot correspond well with their group counts (Figure 3(b)), the next three groups—3-second mode left, DoS, and high-rate sources—account for up to 80% of the total traffic volume. The 3-second mode left volumes declined from 2.5 to 1.8 GB/h over the six months, consistent with the observed decrease in TCP horizontal scans.

## 3. Conclusions and Future Work

Building on the demonstrated utility of the activity classification scheme in Treurniet [12], we have developed a taxonomy for one-way traffic sources using two independent classifying schemes: 14 source types and 10 IAT groups. These schemes separate the one-way traffic into 140 subsets, allowing us to determine which source subsets were active during any hour and track subset behavior over weeks or months as the characteristics of one-way traffic evolve. Using these subsets, we found that:

- Long-term plots of type and group subsets indicate distinguishable changes in the proportions each type or group contributes to total traffic.
- For the first six months of 2011, although the total daily average one-way traffic into the UCSD network telescope did not significantly increase, the composition of per-source traffic behavior changed, with an increase in TCP horizontal scan and a corresponding decrease in stealth 3-second mode sources. Despite the presence of many stealthy (long-lived low-rate) sources, most of the telescope traffic comes from short-lived (< 1/2 hour) sources.
- We have used our iatmon tool to apply this taxonomy to hourly trace files. Its implementation runs fast enough to be used on a live 1 Gb/s network. iatmon also includes tools to extract trace files for sources in 'interesting' type + group subsets that show interesting behavior. Such 'source trace' files can then be examined in detail, for example, to determine whether they represent traffic from known malware.

In the future, we plan to develop iatmon to detect significant changes in source subset counts or volumes, experiment with the thresholds in our IAT group classification scheme, investigate other possible classification schemes (perhaps as 'plug-in modules' for iatmon), and most importantly, explore a cooperative global effort to compare unsolicited traffic across a wider diversity of address space. We are currently operating iatmon in real-time mode on the University of Auckland’s production Internet gateway, a 1 Gb/s link carrying about 70,000 packets/s. We find that 3% of the total traffic inbound to the University each hour is one-way, consistent with another recent study of this link [7].
