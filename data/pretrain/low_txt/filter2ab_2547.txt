**ATT&CK ID:** T1505.005  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Terminal Services DLL

Adversaries may exploit components of Terminal Services (renamed to Remote Desktop Services in some versions of Windows Server as of 2022) to establish persistent access to systems. Microsoft Terminal Services enables remote terminal connections to hosts, allowing servers to transmit a full, interactive, graphical user interface to clients via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). By abusing these components, attackers can maintain long-term control over compromised systems.
