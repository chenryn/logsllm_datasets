### Symbols for Orthogonal Equalization and Secure Ranging

Symbols used for orthogonal equalization under a channel should not be employed in secure ranging, as they provide an additional advantage to early-detecting adversaries. The cyclic prefix is designed to prepend the trailing samples of a symbol at its beginning, thereby circularizing the Fourier matrix under a time-dispersive channel. This creates symbol redundancy, which can aid an early-detecting attacker.

### 5.3.3 PAPR Reduction Techniques

Orthogonal noise with a random phase shift is compatible with techniques for peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction, as phase randomization is one such technique. Another method for PAPR reduction is to limit the symbol set to low-PAPR symbols. In BPSK and QPSK, pruning high-PAPR symbols tends to remove those with stringent late-commit constraints, potentially increasing the overall vulnerability of these configurations.

### 6. Related Work

We compare our analysis of multicarrier-based ranging with existing proposals for secure single-carrier ranging and other physical-layer concepts in wireless communication. Specifically, we focus on mechanisms that aim to protect wireless signals at the physical layer. Secure ranging shares a similar goal, as it must ensure that the arrival time of the signal cannot be subverted by external influences, in addition to protecting physical layer attributes and data integrity.

#### 6.1 Single-Carrier Ranging

Research has produced several protocols for secure single-carrier ranging and distance measurements, with many focusing on ultrawide-band radio (UWB). UWB provides non-cooperative communication at bandwidths up to 500 MHz. Due to their wide spectral use, UWB devices operate at limited output power, but the high bandwidth allows them to send short pulses with high immunity to multipath fading. If data is encapsulated in nanosecond pulses, the window for early-detection/late-commit (ED/LC) attacks is very narrow, as an attacker must advance or delay individual pulses. Effective proposals for pulse emission can be found in [17, 24].

UWB technology has also led to some commercial products [1, 2]. However, the main disadvantage of UWB ranging is its limited power output, making distances greater than 50 to 100 meters (depending on channel conditions) challenging. Increasing frame size can mitigate this, but it results in long communication times in an already uncoordinated spectrum. UWB ranging is thus primarily used for indoor positioning or in two-device configurations, such as keyless entry systems for vehicles.

On the other hand, OFDM has proven to be an extremely reliable modulation technique. While methods to improve the performance of OFDM-based ranging have been proposed [13], its security against physical-layer attacks has not been extensively studied. OFDM-based communication systems can cover distances on the order of kilometers and coordinate many co-existing devices, as seen in 4G and 5G standards. However, the symbol length for OFDM-encoded data is generally longer than UWB pulses, making it important to study the security of OFDM systems in ranging applications.

#### 6.2 Physical-Layer Integrity Protection Schemes and Jamming

Many physical-layer schemes aim to guarantee the integrity of transmitted data. These can be broadly categorized into randomness extraction from the channel (key establishment), MIMO-based approaches (orthogonal blinding, zero-forcing), friendly jamming, and integrity codes [9].

Friendly jamming is related to the countermeasures for OFDM-based ranging proposed in this work. The idea behind phase randomization and orthogonal noise is similar to friendly jamming [10, 21], where an attacker cannot separate the information-bearing message from a jamming signal emitted by a friendly jammer. Intentional signal interference can be used to establish confidentiality, message authentication, or access control [14, 27]. Reactive jamming, on the other hand, analyzes and reacts to packets in the air to annihilate or overwrite certain packets or prevent communication altogether. This is related to the problem statement of the ED/LC attack described in this paper. In reactive jamming, early detection of a signal, based on partial information, is crucial for maximum impact when interfering with the remainder of the signal.

Most related to our work is the survey in [18] comparing different approaches to physical-layer security in OFDM. Most of the presented methods focus on confidentiality at the data bit or symbol level, encrypting or obfuscating the signal and providing resilience against interference [23]. Our approach is similar in that an attacker should not be able to predict the transmitted signal. We propose secure ranging schemes that protect communication at the symbol level rather than entire messages. We are specifically concerned with the learning/listening time required by an attacker to predict the remainder of the symbol, as this is the critical factor for secure time-of-flight ranging.

### 7. Conclusion

We have highlighted the vulnerability of highly performant OFDM modulation schemes for time-of-flight (ToF) distance measurement against an ED/LC attacker operating at the physical layer. Existing proposals for secure ToF distance measurement developed for single-carrier modulation methods require time-domain focusing of bit-information (pulsing) and time-domain padding. This work identifies another possible direction suitable for OFDM systems, using all subcarriers in parallel with randomized constellations.

### A. BPSK Early Detection

**Proof.** An OFDM time-domain sample can be represented as the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) of the frequency-domain modulated symbol samples. We will show that left-right antivalent bits (i.e., bits that do not repeat after \( n_s/2 \) samples) are leaked with the first odd (or any odd) sample. For the first odd sample, we have:

\[
c_1 = \sum_{k=0}^{n_s-1} C_k e^{2\pi ik/n_s}
\]

This can be split into two parts:

\[
c_1 = \sum_{k=0}^{n_s/2-1} C_k e^{2\pi ik/n_s} + \sum_{k=n_s/2}^{n_s-1} C_k e^{2\pi ik/n_s}
\]

By reindexing the second sum:

\[
c_1 = \sum_{k=0}^{n_s/2-1} C_k e^{2\pi ik/n_s} + \sum_{k=0}^{n_s/2-1} C_{k+n_s/2} e^{2\pi i(k+n_s/2)/n_s}
\]

Simplifying the exponent in the second sum:

\[
c_1 = \sum_{k=0}^{n_s/2-1} C_k e^{2\pi ik/n_s} + \sum_{k=0}^{n_s/2-1} C_{k+n_s/2} e^{2\pi ik/n_s} e^{\pi i}
\]

Since \( e^{\pi i} = -1 \):

\[
c_1 = \sum_{k=0}^{n_s/2-1} C_k e^{2\pi ik/n_s} - \sum_{k=0}^{n_s/2-1} C_{k+n_s/2} e^{2\pi ik/n_s}
\]

\[
c_1 = \sum_{k=0}^{n_s/2-1} (C_k - C_{k+n_s/2}) e^{2\pi ik/n_s}
\]

Due to the limited constellation set of BPSK modulation (\( C_k \in \{-1, 1\} \)), the difference between frequency-domain samples can be expressed in terms of a logical bit-level operation:

\[
c_1 = 2 \sum_{k=0}^{n_s/2-1} C_k (b_k \oplus b_{k+n_s/2}) e^{2\pi ik/n_s}
\]

Thus, the first odd sample conveys information about bits that are inverted after \( n_s/2 \) samples. Conversely, the first non-zero even sample (i.e., the sample \( c_2 \)) is oblivious to information about tones that repeat after \( n_s/4 \) samples but conveys information about antivalence of tones \( n_s/4 \) apart.

In the following, we consider the sequence of samples with indices that are powers of two (\( l = 2^L \) and \( 0 \leq L < M \)). From sample \( c_1 \), we learn the sequence \( C_k (b_k \oplus b_{k+n_s/2}) \), i.e., the values of the left-right antisymmetric bits. We can create a compensation term \( \sum_{k=0}^{n_s/2-1} C_k (b_k \oplus b_{k+n_s/2}) e^{2\pi i2k/n_s} \) and add it to \( c_2 \), which recovers the equivalent sample of the IFFT on the first half of the spectrum only, since:

\[
c_2 = \sum_{k=0}^{n_s-1} C_k e^{2\pi i2k/n_s}
\]

This can be split and simplified similarly to the first odd sample, and so on.
