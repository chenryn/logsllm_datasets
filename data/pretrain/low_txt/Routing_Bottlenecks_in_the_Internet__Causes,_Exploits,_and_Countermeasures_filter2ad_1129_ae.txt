### Internet Topology and Routing Bottlenecks

Several long-term projects have measured the router-level Internet topology using traceroute-like tools. Notable among these are CAIDA’s Archipelago project [1] and the DIMES project [41]. Another significant project, Rocketfuel [42], uses approximately 800 vantage points to infer the internal topology of major ISPs. These studies collectively provide valuable insights into the layer-3 topology of the Internet.

Our research on routing bottlenecks differs from these topology studies in two key aspects:
1. **Topology Inference**: We do not measure or infer the router-level topology. Instead, we observe how routes are distributed across the existing router-level topology.
2. **Scope of Routes**: We do not aim to cover the entire address space. Our focus is on route-destination regions that may be of interest to potential adversaries.

### Topological Connectivity Attacks

Topological connectivity attacks can target different levels of the Internet's structure, including inter-AS (Autonomous System) connections, intra-AS connections, and Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISP connections. The reduction in degradation ratio for these different types of connections is illustrated in Figure 16.

### Conclusions

Routing bottlenecks, which naturally occur in the Internet, are characterized by power-law distributions of link occurrences in routes to selected destinations. These bottlenecks are pervasive, ubiquitous, and susceptible to scalable link-flooding attacks. Preventing such attacks requires both specific structural and operational countermeasures. Fortunately, the deployment of these countermeasures by network operators appears to be practical and does not necessitate a major redesign of the Internet.

### Appendix: Routing Bottlenecks for 15 Major Cities

In this appendix, we summarize the measurement results of the routing bottlenecks in 15 major cities around the world.

**Figure 14** shows the normalized link-occurrence distribution for 15 cities. The list is a permutation of the following cities, alphabetically ordered: Beijing, Berlin, Chicago, Guangzhou, Houston, London, Los Angeles, Moscow, New York, Paris, Philadelphia, Rome, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Tianjin. The cities are labeled and ordered by increasing skew of the occurrence distribution, i.e., the value of \(\alpha\) in the Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution.

**Figure 15** shows the degradation ratio for the fifteen major cities. The cities are ordered by increasing the average degradation ratio over \(1 \leq |B| \leq 50\). This order is the same as in Figure 14, suggesting that the value of \(\alpha\) is a good indicator of the vulnerability of the target cities to link-flooding attacks.

The average value of \(\alpha\) for the five European cities (1.57) is noticeably smaller than those of the five US cities (1.79) and the five Chinese cities (1.82). This is due to the diversity of ISP choices in these regions; e.g., European cities have more ISP options due to high competition and low entry costs, while cities in the US and China have fewer choices [14, 49].
