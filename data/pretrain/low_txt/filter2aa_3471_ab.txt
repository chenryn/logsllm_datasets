### Internet Access and Security

**Case Study: Jeremy Hammond and Tor**

- **Incident Overview:**
  - Jeremy Hammond, known online as "sup_g," used the Tor network for anonymity.
  - Although the encryption was not compromised, the FBI correlated the times Hammond was active on IRC (chatting with "Subu") with his home internet usage.

### Freedom Hosting and the FBI

- **Background:**
  - Freedom Hosting was a service that hosted many hidden services, including child pornography sites.
  - It was previously targeted by Anonymous during Operation Darknet due to its hosting of illegal content.

- **FBI Action:**
  - In July 2013, the FBI compromised Freedom Hosting and injected malicious JavaScript that exploited a Firefox vulnerability (CVE-2013-1690) in version 17 ESR.
  - The payload, named "Magneto," reported back the user's MAC address, Windows host name, and unique serial number to servers in Virginia.

  - Eric Eoin Marques, an Irish man, is alleged to be the operator of Freedom Hosting. Payment records linked him to the servers.
  - During a police raid, Marques reportedly tried to shut down his laptop.

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Avoid hosting illegal content.
  - Regularly update and patch software.
  - Follow financial trails carefully.
  - Keep encrypted devices powered off when not in use.

### Exploiting Hidden Services

- **Methodology:**
  - Identify if a hidden service is vulnerable to exploits such as buffer overflows or web application shell execution.
  - Send a payload that contacts a monitored IP address.

### Silk Road and Ross Ulbricht

- **Investigation:**
  - The FBI traced early references to Silk Road, leading to a post by "altoid" on Shroomery.org on January 27, 2011.
  - [Shroomery Forum Post](http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/13860995)
  - Another post by "altoid" on Bitcointalk.org mentioned Silk Road and provided instructions for accessing it.
  - [Bitcointalk Post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175.msg42479#msg42479)

- **Evidence:**
  - An account named "altoid" posted on Bitcointalk.org seeking an "IT pro in the bitcoin community" and directed interested parties to contact "rossulbricht at gmail dot com."
  - [Bitcointalk Post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47811.0)
  - Ross Ulbricht's Google+ profile showed an interest in the Mises Institute, which was also referenced by DPR.
  - [StackOverflow Post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15445285/how-can-i-connect-to-a-tor-hidden-service-using-curl-in-php)

- **Takedown:**
  - The FBI identified connections from an internet caf√© near Ross Ulbricht's residence in San Francisco.
  - Private messages on Silk Road indicated DPR lived in the Pacific time zone.
  - The FBI seized Silk Road servers, possibly through a money trail or by hacking the site to reveal its real IP.
