**By Viss!**
**Prepared for Defcon 20, Thursday, July 12, 2012**

This is not just another SHODAN talk. Today, we will transform SHODAN into a gateway drug, exploring the uncharted territories of the internet.

#### What Do People Put on the Internet?

Routers, switches, servers, printersâ€”been there, done that. Show me something new!

#### Unaccounted for on the Internet

Is anyone actually checking what's out there? Has anyone ever done this? Apparently not.

#### A Policy Editorial

If you can't scan yourself freely, how do you determine your level of exposure? What is your attack surface?

#### Before We Begin

- **Public Access**: Everything found here is publicly accessible.
- **No Credentials Required**: No "secure" systems. This is all "free play."
- **Read-Only Exercise**: No systems were altered. This was a read-only exercise.

#### Webcams

Who watches the watchers? Meeeeeeee >:D

#### SCADA Gear and Other Devices

- **SCADA Gear on Webcams**
- **Other Stuff on Webcams**

But most cameras are boring. Let's look at some more interesting finds:

- **A T-2000 (Hydrogen Fuel Cell)**: Looks industrial and is used a lot in military applications.
- **How to Use It**

#### Where to Find These Things

- **Wind Farms**
- **Lighting, HVAC, Alarms**
- **Power Meters, Heat Pumps, Private Residences, Water Heaters**
- **Familiar Displays, Power Systems, Industrial Systems, Contents Under Pressure**

#### Actionable Information

What if anything is actually actionable? Let's flex our OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) muscles.

##### Level One: Simple Recon

- **Quick Observations**: What details can we see?
- **Leaking Data in Meatspace**: Company name leads to address.

##### Level Two: Interactions

**Disclaimer**: I had no idea this happened until someone showed me a gallery of screencaps.

##### Level Three: Live Free or Die Hard

- **Social Engineering Campaign**: Timothy Olyphant did it with a semi-truck filled with millions of dollars of equipment and a black ops team.
- **Massive Coolers, SCADA Logs, Power/UPS Gear, VNC Touchpanels, i.lon (Stackable like Devo hats)**

#### Control Over Businesses

I can control the power, lights, HVAC, ice skating rink, garage doors, water pressure, and boilers of 36 businesses in one town. Getting a little closer, eh?

- **Econolite (Stoplights)**
- **AUTOPLATE (Red Light Cameras)**
- **DakTronics (Road Signs and Stoplights)**

#### Current Events and Malware

- **Ruggedcom and Other Fun Stuff**
- **Malware-Like Appearance**: I put that on Twitter, and a day later, DHS called my cellphone.

#### More Discoveries

- **Satellite Systems, NAS Storage Arrays, LaserWash Car Wash Systems, Massive Humidifiers, Emergency Telco Gear, Speakers, Massive Wine Cooler**

#### Long-Term Thinking

- **Trending Data**: Since scanning the whole internet is getting easier, we can take measurements.
- **Measurable Results**: Remember the webcam stuff I did back in January?
  - **Original Blog Post**: Jan 10
  - **My Blog Post**: Jan 24 (560 cameras)
  - **BBC Article**: Feb 7
  - **Retest**: April 3 (464 cameras)
  - **US Media Picks It Up**: Mid-April
  - **Second Retest**: May 24 (465 cameras)
  - **Third Retest**: July 12 (490 cameras)

It scales, and I'm working on it.
