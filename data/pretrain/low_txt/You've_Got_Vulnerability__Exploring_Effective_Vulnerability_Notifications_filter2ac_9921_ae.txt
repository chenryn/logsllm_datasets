### IPv6 Notification: Terse with Link

**Subject:** [RAND#] Potentially Misconfigured IPv6 Port Security Policies

**Body:**
Computer scientists at the University of Michigan, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and the University of California Berkeley have been conducting Internet-wide scans to detect IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack hosts that allow access to services via IPv6 but not IPv4. This likely indicates a firewall misconfiguration and could be a security vulnerability if the services should not be publicly accessible. We have attached a list of potentially vulnerable hosts on your network.

### IPv6 Notification: Verbose

**Subject:** [RAND#] Potentially Misconfigured IPv6 Port Security Policies

**Body:**
During a recent study on the network security policies of IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack hosts, computer scientists at the University of Michigan, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and the University of California Berkeley have been conducting Internet-wide scans to detect IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack hosts that allow access to services via IPv6 but not IPv4. This likely indicates a firewall misconfiguration and could be a security vulnerability if the services should not be publicly accessible. We have attached a list of potentially vulnerable hosts on your network (as determined by WHOIS information).

For each dual-stack host, we test whether popular services (e.g., SSH, Telnet, and NTP) are accessible via IPv4 and/or IPv6 using standard protocol handshakes. For ICMP, this is an echo request; for TCP, it is a SYN segment; and for UDP, this is an application-specific request (e.g., DNS A query for 'www.google.com' or an NTP version query). We do not exploit any vulnerabilities, attempt to log in, or access any non-public information.

The protocols we scanned are popular targets for attacks and/or can be used to launch DDoS attacks when left publicly available on the Internet. We suspect they are misconfigured and are notifying you because hosts rarely offer services on IPv6 that are not offered on IPv4, and we believe these services may have been left exposed accidentally. This is a common occurrence when administrators forget to configure IPv6 firewall policies along with IPv4 policies.

If these IPv6-only accessible services should not be accessible to the public Internet, they can be restricted by updating your firewall or by disabling or removing the services. If none of your systems use IPv6, you can also disable IPv6 on your system. Make sure your changes are persistent and will not be undone by a system reboot.

### ICS Notification: Terse with Link

**Subject:** [RAND#] Vulnerable SCADA Devices

**Body:**
Computer scientists at the University of Michigan and the University of California Berkeley have been conducting Internet-wide scans to detect publicly accessible industrial control (SCADA) devices. These devices frequently have no built-in security and their public exposure may place physical equipment at risk for attack. We have attached a list of SCADA devices on your network that are publicly accessible.

### ICS Notification: Verbose

**Subject:** [RAND#] Vulnerable SCADA Devices

**Body:**
During a recent study on the public exposure of industrial control systems, computer scientists at the University of Michigan and the University of California Berkeley have been conducting Internet-wide scans to detect publicly accessible industrial control (SCADA) devices. These devices frequently have no built-in security and their public exposure may place physical equipment at risk for attack. We have attached a list of SCADA devices on your network (as determined by WHOIS information) that are publicly accessible.

We scan for potentially vulnerable SCADA systems by scanning the full IPv4 address space and attempting protocol discovery handshakes (e.g., Modbus device ID query). We do not exploit any vulnerabilities or change any device state.

SCADA protocols, including Modbus, S7, Bacnet, Tridium Fox, and DNP3, allow remote control and monitoring of physical infrastructure and equipment over IP. Unfortunately, these protocols lack critical security features, such as basic authentication and encryption, or have known security vulnerabilities. If left publicly accessible on the Internet, these protocols can be the target of attackers looking to monitor or damage physical equipment, such as power control, process automation, and HVAC control systems.

SCADA services are not designed to be publicly accessible on the Internet and should be maintained on an internal, segmented network, or otherwise protected by a firewall that limits who can interact with these hosts. Make sure your changes are persistent and will not be undone by a system reboot.

### DDoS Amplification Notification: Terse with Link

**Subject:** [RAND#] Vulnerable DDoS Amplifiers

**Body:**
Computer scientists at George Mason University and the University of California Berkeley have been detecting open and misconfigured services that serve as amplifiers for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Attackers abuse these amplifiers to launch powerful DDoS attacks while hiding the true attack source. We have attached a list of potentially vulnerable hosts on your network.

### DDoS Amplification Notification: Verbose

**Subject:** [RAND#] Vulnerable DDoS Amplifiers

**Body:**
During a recent study on distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, computer scientists at George Mason University and the University of California Berkeley have been conducting Internet-wide scans for open and misconfigured services that serve as amplifiers for DDoS attacks. Attackers abuse these amplifiers to launch powerful DDoS attacks while hiding the true attack source. We have attached a list of potentially vulnerable hosts on your network (as determined by WHOIS information).

We detect amplifiers by monitoring hosts involved in recent DDoS attacks and checking whether these hosts support the features used for launching an attack (e.g., NTP monlist or recursive DNS resolution). We do not exploit any vulnerabilities or attempt to access any non-public data on these servers.

DDoS attacks are often conducted by directing an overwhelming amount of network traffic towards a target system, making it unresponsive. Amplifiers are services that send large amounts of data in response to small requests. Attackers leverage these in DDoS attacks by spoofing traffic to the amplifier, forging it to look as if it came from the attacker’s target. Amplifiers then respond to the target with a large response that overwhelms the target. Publicly accessible amplifiers are constantly abused by attackers to conduct DDoS attacks for them while hiding the tracks of the real attacker.

These amplifiers can be avoided by disabling the application or updating your firewall to block the application port or restrict the IP addresses that can access it. Specifically, Chargen should be closed as it is rarely useful and is inherently an amplifier. If left open, DNS should be configured to restrict who can make recursive requests, and NTP should be configured to disable the monlist functionality. Make sure your changes are persistent and will not be undone by a system reboot.
