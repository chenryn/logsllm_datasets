### Scalability Considerations for e-Government Applications

#### User Access and Acceptance
- **User-Friendly Access**: Citizens should be able to access e-Government applications using their preferred web browsers. This approach enhances user acceptance, as no additional software, other than a security capsule (e.g., a smart card provided by the CSP), is required.
  
#### Centralized Control and Management
- **Centralized Application Management**: Applications should be centrally controlled to facilitate enhancements and modifications. A smooth transition to the new security architecture is essential, especially in operational and proprietary environments, to avoid costly and potentially unfeasible transitions.

- **Transparent Integration**: Concepts for transparently integrating the security architecture into existing systems need to be developed to ensure a seamless transition.

### Security Strategy for e-Government Applications

#### Security Classes
1. **Normal Use**:
   - **TLS (HTTPS)**: This class uses the TLS capabilities of modern web browsers and servers. No security capsule is needed, making it suitable for information retrieval, such as accessing form archives.
   
2. **Trustworthy Infrastructure**:
   - **Security Capsule for Identification and Signatures**: This class employs the security capsule for identification and electronic signatures but relies on the HTTPS implementation of the browser and server. The web browser and server are considered a trustworthy infrastructure.

3. **Technical End-to-End Security**:
   - **Highest Security Level**: This class involves the security capsule replacing the session certificate establishment of the browser. However, this requires changes in the web browser, such as additional plugins.

### Workflow Example: Tax Form Submission

- **Initial Access**: The citizen accesses the tax office’s web server. Assuming a security class II, the citizen needs to identify themselves through an "automatic authentication" process.
  
- **Automatic Authentication**:
  - **Security Layer**: Both the citizen's PC and the tax office’s web server run a security layer.
  - **Active Component (Servlet)**: An active component at the web server initiates the VPK-based identification process.
  - **Handshake Process**: The active component redirects an HTTP request to the security layer, asking for the release of the persona binding, which the citizen must permit.
  - **VPK Construction**: The ZMR is combined with the tax declaration ID, and the VPK is constructed and signed with a timestamp and nonce to prevent replays.
  - **Authentication Transformation**: The unique VPK can be transformed into a conventional authentication scheme, such as a username/password, to access existing applications.

- **Form Filling and Submission**:
  - **Web Form**: The web server offers a web form that can be filled out by the citizen. Smart forms can automatically populate fields like name and date of birth from the persona binding or known data.
  - **XML Conversion**: The completed form is converted to XML and redirected to the security layer for signing.
  - **Signature Verification**: The server-side security capsule verifies the signature and forwards the tax declaration to the treasury’s back-end system.

### Current and Upcoming e-Government Applications

- **Operational Applications**:
  - Social insurance system filings.
  - Business registration in Vienna (without electronic signatures).

- **Upcoming Applications**:
  - Petitions to federal ministries (fall 2002).
  - Penal record reports (fall 2002).
  - Online access to tax offices for all citizens (beginning 2003).

- **Private-Public Partnership**:
  - The banking sector will launch electronically signed acknowledgments of money orders (fall/winter 2002). This allows citizens to pay process fees via online banking and attach signed payment confirmations to proceedings.

### Conclusions

- **Security Architecture**: The paper discusses the security architecture used in Austrian e-Government initiatives, including legal provisions and general requirements.
- **Citizen Card**: The core of the security infrastructure is the citizen card, which supports creating electronic signatures and storing additional data like certificates.
- **Security Capsule**: A security capsule approach ensures flexibility and forward-compatibility, allowing easy integration of upcoming security technologies without tailoring each e-Government application.
