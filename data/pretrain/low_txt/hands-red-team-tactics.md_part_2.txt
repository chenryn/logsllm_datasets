# Preface
Red Teaming is a method used to enhance security by simulating attacks on an organization to detect network and system vulnerabilities. "Hands-On Red Team Tactics" begins with an overview of penetration testing (pentesting) and Red Teaming, followed by an introduction to some of the latest pentesting tools. You will then explore Metasploit and become familiar with Armitage. After mastering the basics, you will learn about Cobalt Strike, including its setup and usage.

This comprehensive guide covers advanced methods for pivoting, post-exploitation using Cobalt Strike, and introduces you to Command-and-Control (C2) servers and redirectors. By the end of the book, you will have learned advanced penetration testing techniques, such as obtaining reverse shells over encrypted channels and maintaining persistent access. You will also explore frameworks like Empire, which help in maintaining persistent access, staying untraceable, and establishing reverse connections over various C2 covert channels.

# Who This Book Is For

# Red-Teaming and Pentesting
Penetration testing is an authorized attack on a computer system to evaluate its security, identify vulnerabilities, and assess the associated risks. The 1960s marked the beginning of the age of computer security. In this chapter, we will cover the widely used methodology of pentesting and the red-teaming approach, which is increasingly adopted by corporations.

## Topics Covered:
- Pentesting 101
- A Different Approach

### Pentesting 101
Penetration testing follows various standards, such as OWASP, OSSTMM, ISSAF, and PTES. We will cover these standards, with a detailed look at the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES).

#### OWASP
OWASP is a worldwide not-for-profit charitable organization focused on improving software security. It provides documentation on various aspects of application security, including:
- Information gathering
- Configuration and deployment management testing
- Identity management testing
- Authentication testing
- Authorization testing
- Session management testing
- Input validation testing
- Error handling
- Cryptography
- Business logic testing
- Client-side testing

#### Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)
The OSSTMM is a peer-reviewed manual providing actionable information to improve operational security. Key sections include:
- Operational security metrics
- Trust analysis
- Work flow
- Human security testing
- Physical security testing
- Wireless security testing
- Telecommunications security testing
- Data networks security testing
- Compliance regulations
- Reporting with the Security Test Audit Report (STAR)

#### Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF)
ISSAF aims to evaluate an organization's information security policy and process compliance with industry standards, laws, and regulatory requirements. The current version is 0.2.

#### Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)
PTES is the most widely used standard and covers all aspects of pentesting. It is divided into seven phases:
1. Pre-engagement interactions
2. Intelligence gathering
3. Threat modeling
4. Vulnerability analysis
5. Exploitation
6. Post-exploitation
7. Reporting

### Pre-engagement Interactions
These actions involve processes carried out before the activity, such as defining the scope, setting rules of engagement, and obtaining necessary permissions.
