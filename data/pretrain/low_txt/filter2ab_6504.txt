The `HIDE_OVERLAY_WINDOWS` permission was introduced in Android 12. This permission allows applications to hide overlay windows of the `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY` type, which are drawn by other apps that have the `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission. Consequently, this prevents other applications from creating overlay windows on top of the current application. [2]
