## Executive Summary
Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is an integrated system comprising smart meters, communication networks, and data management systems, enabling two-way communication between utilities and customers. This system facilitates several functions previously performed manually, such as automatic and remote measurement of electricity use, service connection and disconnection, tamper detection, outage identification, and voltage monitoring. When combined with customer technologies like in-home displays and programmable communicating thermostats, AMI enables utilities to offer new time-based rate programs and incentives, encouraging customers to reduce peak demand and manage energy consumption and costs.

This report shares key results and benefits from the 70 Smart Grid Investment Grant (SGIG) projects implementing AMI and customer system technologies, and documents lessons learned on technology installation and implementation strategies. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) aims to further accelerate grid modernization by helping decision-makers better assess the benefits and costs of AMI and customer system investments and learn from leading-edge utilities.

### The Smart Grid Investment Grant (SGIG) Program
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 provided DOE with $3.4 billion to invest in 99 SGIG projects aimed at modernizing the electric grid, strengthening cybersecurity, improving interoperability, and collecting smart grid impact data. Electricity industry recipients matched or exceeded this investment dollar-for-dollar. Deployment of AMI and customer systems accounted for more than two-thirds of the $7.9 billion total SGIG investment. SGIG projects invested in new communication networks and information management systems that form the backbone of AMI, and tested:

- 16.3 million smart meters—29% of total U.S. smart meters installed by 2014
- 250,000 programmable communicating thermostats (PCTs)
- 400,000 direct load control (DLC) devices
- 100,000 in-home displays (IHDs)
- 417,000 participants in time-based rate and incentive programs
- 49 customer web portals

### Major Findings
SGIG projects demonstrated that AMI and customer systems can achieve substantial grid impacts and benefits for both customers and utilities, including:

- Timely billing, fewer customer disputes, and improvements in operational efficiencies.
- Greater customer control over electricity consumption, costs, and bills through the use of new customer tools (e.g., web portals and smart thermostats) and techniques (e.g., shifting demand to off-peak periods).
- Lower utility capital expenditures and customer bill savings resulting from reduced peak demand and improvements in asset utilization and maintenance.
- Lower outage costs and fewer inconveniences for customers from faster outage restoration and more precise dispatching of repair crews to the locations where they are needed.
- Operational and maintenance (O&M) cost savings from remote billing and metering services, which is a major benefit stream for the AMI business case. Enhanced revenue collection and improved customer service and satisfaction.

Over a three-year period, SGIG projects cumulatively:

- Saved $316 million in O&M costs—an average of $16.6 million per project reporting
- Avoided 13.7 million truck rolls and 68.3 million vehicle-miles traveled
- Saved an estimated 15,160 tons of CO2 equivalent emissions

### Key Lessons and Conclusions
- **Multiple Factors Affect the AMI Business Case:** Implementation costs and benefits varied widely across projects due to factors such as the scale of deployment, communication network upgrades, and integration with other systems.
- **Communications Networks Create More Value When Designed to Serve Smart Grid Technology Needs Beyond AMI:** Robust communications networks designed to support additional smart grid functionalities beyond metering and billing increase the value of the investment.
- **Systems Integration is a Critical Linchpin for AMI Impacts and Benefits:** Efficient and accurate billing and metering require integration of AMI, MDMS, CIS, and billing systems. Further integration with OMS, DMS, and other DA systems can enhance the benefits of each individual smart grid technology.
- **Workforce Management and Training are Critical to AMI Success:** Organizational changes and workforce training programs are essential to develop new skillsets in areas such as database management, data analytics, and cybersecurity.
- **Cybersecurity and Interoperability Are Integral to Smart Grid:** Strong cybersecurity and customer privacy protections are key focuses as AMI deployments grow.

### Future Directions and Next Steps
With the SGIG projects complete, many recipients are building upon project results by expanding technology deployments, offering successful pilot programs to more customers, or improving the integration of AMI with other data and information management systems to extract additional value or activate new smart meter capabilities. The DOE continues to support grid modernization through research, development, demonstration, analysis, and technology transfer activities.

While the SGIG program is now complete, grid modernization and consumer engagement remain important national priorities. The DOE’s Grid Modernization Initiative (GMI) recently released a Grid Modernization Multi-Year Program Plan (MYPP) that describes the challenges and opportunities for achieving a modern, secure, sustainable, and reliable grid, and how the DOE will enable this through programs and activities. The Grid Modernization Lab Consortium, a multi-year collaboration among 14 DOE National Laboratories and regional networks, will assist the DOE in developing and implementing the activities in the MYPP.

### AMI and Customer System Deployment in the Smart Grid Investment Grants
In 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) launched the Smart Grid Investment Grant (SGIG) program, funded with $3.4 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, to jumpstart modernization of the nation’s electricity system, strengthen cybersecurity, improve interoperability, and collect an unprecedented level of data on smart grid and customer operations. When matched with an additional $4.5 billion in industry investment, the 99 SGIG projects invested a total of $7.9 billion in new smart grid technology and equipment for transmission, distribution, metering, and customer systems.

The large public and private investments made under ARRA have accelerated smart grid technology deployments, providing real-world data on technology costs and benefits along with valuable lessons learned and best practices. This report informs electric utilities, policymakers, and other key stakeholders of the qualitative and quantitative impacts, benefits, costs, and lessons learned from SGIG projects that implemented advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and customer systems. The SGIG program concluded in 2015, making this the DOE’s final report on AMI and customer system results.

### Figure 1: Breakdown of $7.9 Billion SGIG Investment
- **Electric Transmission System:** $507,000,000
- **Electric Distribution System:** $2,191,000,000
- **Advanced Metering Infrastructure:** $4,439,000,000
- **Customer Systems:** $780,000,000

Industry and government collectively invested $5.21 billion in projects testing one or more AMI and customer technologies, accounting for more than two-thirds (67%) of the total SGIG investment. Projects with AMI or customer system components represent 70 of the 99 total SGIG recipients. Electric utilities led 67 of the AMI and customer system projects, while vendors or service providers led the remaining 3.3. While nearly all projects deployed a combination of both AMI and customer system technologies, six program participants focused only on customer systems.

### 1.1 AMI and Customer Technologies and Functions Deployed in SGIG
AMI applies smart control and communication technologies to automate metering functions typically accomplished through manually intensive operations, including electricity meter readings, service connection and disconnection, tamper and theft detection, fault and outage identification, and voltage monitoring. Combined with advanced customer-based technologies, AMI also enables utilities to offer new rate options that incentivize customers to reduce peak demand and energy consumption.

#### AMI Deployment Components:
- **Smart Meters:** Installed at the customer’s premise, these meters collect electricity consumption data in 5-, 15-, 30-, or 60-minute intervals.
- **Communication Networks:** Transmit the large volume of interval load data from the meter to the utility back offices.
- **Meter Data Management System (MDMS):** Stores and processes interval load data, integrating it with key information and control systems, including head-end systems, billing systems, customer information systems (CIS), geographic information systems (GIS), outage management systems (OMS), and distribution management systems (DMS).

#### Customer Systems:
- **Control Technologies:** Include devices such as programmable communicating thermostats (PCTs) and direct load control (DLC) devices that utilities and customers use to automatically control heating and cooling systems or other energy-intensive devices. Home-area networks (HAN) and energy management systems can be installed to automatically control appliances in response to price signals, load conditions, or pre-set preferences.
- **Information Technologies:** Provide near real-time data about electricity consumption and costs through in-home displays (IHDs), web portals, and text/email. Web portals and IHDs provide information in visually appealing ways to improve understanding and insight about actions that can save energy and reduce bills.

### Advanced Metering Infrastructure
Over half of the 64 AMI utilities implemented full-scale smart meter deployments covering more than 90% of customers. These projects used DOE funds to modernize their entire metering infrastructure and took advantage of several new functions and capabilities enabled by AMI. Eleven projects chose to deploy smart meters on a pilot scale (to less than 20% of customers), seeking to test meter installation and operation before committing to system-wide deployments. The remaining 20 SGIG AMI projects implemented partial deployments and may later expand to system-wide deployments. SGIG funding accelerated plans and enabled broader use of new AMI functions and capabilities for all participating utilities.

#### Smart Meters
The core element of AMI is smart meters, which provide several functions, including measuring customer electricity consumption on 5-, 15-, 30-, or 60-minute intervals; measuring voltage levels; and monitoring the on/off status of electric service. Smart meters communicate these readings to utilities for processing, analysis, and re-communication back to customers for billing, energy feedback, and time-based rates.

### Figure 3: Scale of SGIG AMI Deployments (% of Utility System)

- **Pilot-scale Deployments:** Less than 20% of customers
- **Partial Deployments:** Between 20% and 90% of customers
- **Full-scale Deployments:** More than 90% of customers
