### Executive Summary
On average, the executive personalization is quite effective.

### 7. Related Work
Most efforts in the rapidly growing field of mobile privacy research focus on detection and prevention techniques for information leaks, particularly in Android mobile applications [45, 26, 43, 15, 35]. Notable projects in this area include TaintDroid [16] and Aquifer [35], which we will not detail here due to space constraints. Our work complements these efforts: while leak detection tools prevent the malicious use of private data, MOREPRIV offers developers a way to use private data without compromising user privacy.

### 8. Conclusions
#### Resolving the Tension Between Personalization and Privacy
The challenge of balancing extensible personalization with privacy is not new. We address this issue with our custom classifiers mechanism. Extensive work has been done on verified extensions in various contexts, such as OS drivers and browser extensions. The problem of checking extensions for privacy leaks can be addressed through static analysis [6], type systems [21], and runtime information flow tracking. These validation methods can be integrated with MOREPRIV or applied by app store maintainers, but validating extensions is not the primary focus of our work. Unlike many extensible systems, we do not require custom classifiers to be written in a special language, as seen in [18].

#### Client-Side Computing for Enhanced Privacy
MOREPRIV aligns with efforts that advocate client-side computing to enhance user privacy. In the context of ad delivery, several researchers propose storing sensitive personal data and all ads on the client side [23, 44, 27]. This approach ensures that when an ad is displayed, it is matched to personal information locally, thus avoiding the need to leak data to the ad network. Accounting and click-fraud prevention are addressed using either additional semi-trusted parties or homomorphic encryption. While MOREPRIV can be used for personalized advertising, its applicability extends beyond just advertising.

#### Comparison with RePriv
RePriv [18] explored personalization in web browsers by building user interest profiles based on browsing history, classifying sites according to the Open Directory Project (ODP) taxonomy. In contrast, MOREPRIV focuses on the mobile space and integrates directly into the operating system, drawing from more diverse data sources and providing integrity through zero-knowledge proofs. Key differences between RePriv and MOREPRIV include:
1. **Coarse-Grained Data**: MOREPRIV uses very coarse-grained user data, limiting its disclosure to apps. This persona-based approach differs significantly from RePriv's taxonomy-based approach.
2. **Developer Flexibility**: MOREPRIV does not impose a specific development language or a cumbersome type system on developers.
3. **Automatic Personalization**: MOREPRIV provides automatic personalization for legacy applications.
4. **Integrity and Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: MOREPRIV emphasizes integrity and employs zero-knowledge proof techniques.
5. **Rich Data Sources**: Being at the OS level, MOREPRIV has access to a variety of rich data sources, making personalization approaches for the browser and OS substantially different.

#### Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Zero-knowledge proofs [5, 7, 13] have been extensively used in privacy and applied cryptography literature. Protocols have been developed for proving linear relations [9], equality and inequality [41], logical connectives [9], multiplication [10], division and modulo [11], and set membership [10]. Collectively, this work allows the construction of zero-knowledge proofs for arbitrary circuits, similar to fully-homomorphic encryption [19].

#### Contributions and Experimental Results
This paper proposes operating system-level mechanisms to support the automatic personalization of legacy applications and simplify the creation of new personalized applications, primarily focusing on mobile operating systems. Implementing these tools at the OS level allows us to leverage a broad range of user activities and distill them into a trusted source of personalization information. We believe that at the OS level, these opportunities are largely untapped.

We demonstrate that personalization can be achieved quickly and effectively using personae, which provide a degree of pseudonymity and are easy for users and developers to understand. We show how both universal and custom personalization can be implemented with minimal developer effort, making persona and location information ubiquitous on mobile devices. We also experimentally evaluate how MOREPRIV supports the integrity of custom classifiers using zero-knowledge proofs. For a classifier using 100 feature words, the prover time is about 11 seconds, the proof transfer time is under a second on an average 3G connection, and the battery utilization is negligible—under 1 mAh. Our results indicate that trusted classification is feasible with today’s zero-knowledge techniques.

Finally, we conducted a crowd-sourced user study showing that MOREPRIV-style personalization improves the relevance of Yelp results, with business executives preferring MOREPRIV-personalized results most of the time (a boost of ~30%). Our experiments highlight cases where the general population and users with a particular persona disagree on what is most relevant, underscoring the need for user profiling and personalization.

We believe that MOREPRIV is timely and can enable game-changing innovation around privacy through client-side computing.
