I have the following navigation bar on my website:

- Home
- One to One
- Classes
  - Online Yoga Classes
  - Free Downloads
  - Gallery
- Retreats & Workshops
- Pregnancy Mums
- Treatments
- About Me
- Testimonials
- About Yoga

The issue I am encountering is that when the navigation bar is collapsed on mobile devices, the links within the dropdown menu do not navigate to the new page. Instead, selecting a link within the dropdown simply closes the dropdown, as if the click is being registered on the parent `<li>` element rather than the link itself.

When the navigation bar is expanded, or when it is collapsed on a device that uses a mouse, the links work correctly and navigate to the new page. The problem seems to occur specifically when using a touch device. You can see this issue live at [http://yogarelax.harpoonmysite.com](http://yogarelax.harpoonmysite.com).

Any assistance with resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
