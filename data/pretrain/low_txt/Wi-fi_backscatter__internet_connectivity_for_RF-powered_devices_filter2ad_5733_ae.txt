### Unlikely that Normal Wi-Fi Traffic Generates a Structure Matching the Wi-Fi Backscatter Preamble

### 9. EFFECT OF REFLECTIONS ON WI-FI COMMUNICATION

Next, we evaluate the impact of reflections created by our prototype device on communication between a Wi-Fi transmitter-receiver pair. Specifically, we stress-test the system when the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag is in close proximity to the receiver. Note that in practice, a Wi-Fi Backscatter device modulates only when queried by a Wi-Fi reader. However, for the purpose of stress-testing, we configure the Wi-Fi Backscatter to continuously send bits at two different data rates: 1 kbps and 100 bps.

Since Wi-Fi uses bit rate adaptation, we fix the Wi-Fi receiver and the prototype in location 1 (as shown in Fig. 13) and move the Wi-Fi transmitter across the remaining locations. The devices use their default bit rate adaptation algorithms. We use the built-in Wi-Fi of a Lenovo Thinkpad laptop as the transmitter and a Linksys WRT54GL AP as the receiver. In each run of the experiment, the Wi-Fi transmitter sends UDP packets for two minutes, logging the throughput every 500 ms. We compute the average throughput by calculating the mean over the two-minute duration. In each Wi-Fi transmitter location, we measure the average throughput both with and without our prototype.

Fig. 19 (a) and (b) shows the average data rate as a function of the Wi-Fi transmitter location for two different distances between the prototype device and the Wi-Fi receiver. Each figure plots the data rates in three scenarios: without the prototype, and when the prototype transmits at 100 bps and 1 kbps. The figures show that while there is some variation in the observed data rate across these scenarios (most notably in location 5, where the experiments were performed with heavy Wi-Fi utilization due to the presence of a class in the adjacent room), the variations are generally within the expected variance. This suggests that Wi-Fi's rate adaptation can easily handle the small variations in channel quality caused by the reflections from our prototype.

### 10. EVALUATING CORRELATION EFFECTS ON WI-FI BACKSCATTER UPLINK RANGE

Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of extending the uplink range of Wi-Fi Backscatter using the correlation technique described in §3.4. Specifically, we place the Wi-Fi helper (an Intel Wi-Fi Link 5300 card) 3 meters away from the Wi-Fi reader (also an Intel Wi-Fi Link 5300 card). The Wi-Fi Backscatter tag encodes zero and one bits using long code sequences of length \( N \); the Wi-Fi reader correlates with these code sequences to decode the bits as described in §3.4.

We vary the distance between the Wi-Fi reader and the prototype and measure the correlation length at which the observed bit error rate at the Wi-Fi reader is less than \( 10^{-2} \).

Fig. 20 plots these correlation lengths as a function of the distance between the reader and our prototype. The figure shows that as the correlation length increases, the range at which Wi-Fi Backscatter's uplink operates also increases. Specifically, using a correlation length of 20 bits, we establish the uplink communication link at distances of about 1.6 meters between the Wi-Fi reader and the prototype. The required correlation length increases significantly with the distance between the Wi-Fi reader and the prototype. For example, at distances of 2.1 meters, we need a correlation length of about 150 bits. While this would reduce the effective bit rates achieved on the uplink, it is important to note that establishing a communication link between Wi-Fi Backscatter tags and existing Wi-Fi devices, even at a low rate, is beneficial for many Internet-of-Things applications.

### 11. RELATED WORK

Wi-Fi Backscatter is related to work on RFID systems [8, 28, 29], which use dedicated powered infrastructure (RFID readers) to provide power and enable communication with battery-free tags. The cost of deploying and maintaining such an infrastructure has limited the adoption of these systems. In contrast, RF-powered devices can harvest ambient RF signals (e.g., TV, cellular, and Wi-Fi) and thus eliminate the need for dedicated infrastructure. Traditional radio communication consumes significantly more power than is available in RF signals [23], making it challenging to connect these devices to the Internet. Wi-Fi Backscatter addresses this problem with a novel system that bridges RF-powered devices and the Internet.

Wi-Fi Backscatter is also related to recent work on ambient backscatter communication [17], which enables two RF-powered devices to communicate by scattering ambient TV signals. While ambient backscatter can enable a network of RF-powered devices to communicate with each other, it does not provide Internet connectivity. Deploying powered infrastructure devices equipped with both ambient backscatter communication and traditional power-consuming radios diminishes the key benefit of RF-powered systems, which is the ability to operate without dedicated infrastructure. Wi-Fi Backscatter enables RF-powered devices to communicate with existing Wi-Fi infrastructure, bringing us closer to the vision of an RF-powered Internet of Things.

Wi-Fi Backscatter differs from both RFID and ambient backscatter systems in that these systems decode backscatter information from a single continuous signal source, such as an RFID reader or a TV tower. Further, the decoding is performed on custom hardware designed for this purpose. In contrast, this paper introduces a method to modulate the Wi-Fi channel and demonstrates that decoding can be performed on off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices. Additionally, we show how to detect Wi-Fi packets and communicate using this capability.

Recent work has demonstrated the ability to harvest power from ambient signals, including TV [26, 19, 15, 25] and cellular transmissions [27, 23]. More recently, researchers have shown the feasibility of harvesting energy from Wi-Fi transmissions [22, 21, 11]: [14] harvests and backscatters signals using transmissions from Agilent 89600 custom 2.4 GHz transceiver hardware, and [22, 11] demonstrate the feasibility of power harvesting using signals from off-the-shelf Wi-Fi access points. Wi-Fi Backscatter builds on this work but is complementary in that it transforms existing Wi-Fi signals into a communication medium for battery-free devices. Specifically, we are the first to establish a communication link between RF-powered devices and commodity Wi-Fi devices.

### 12. CONCLUSION

RF-powered devices hold the promise to realize a pervasive vision of the "Internet of Things" where devices can be embedded into everyday objects and achieve computation, sensing, and communication without the need for batteries. This paper provides a critical component in this vision: the ability to connect RF-powered devices to the Internet.

We present Wi-Fi Backscatter, a novel communication system that bridges RF-powered devices with the Internet. We show that it is possible to reuse existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to provide Internet connectivity to RF-powered devices. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by building a hardware prototype and establishing the first communication link between an RF-powered device and commodity Wi-Fi devices. Experiments with off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices achieve communication rates of up to 1 kbps and ranges of up to 2.1 meters. We believe this new capability is critical for the commercial adoption of RF-powered Internet of Things.
