### Path Mining and Process Mining for Workflow Management Systems

The developed path mining technique has achieved encouraging results by projecting information extracted from logs onto an initial model. This projection helps in identifying bottlenecks in a process model through event log analysis.

- When three or more attributes are involved in the prediction, the system can correctly predict the path followed in more than 75% of the process instances.
- With four attributes, the accuracy improves to over 82%.
- Involving five attributes results in a prediction accuracy of up to 93.4%.
- When all six attributes are used, the accuracy is 88.9%.

However, when a small number of attributes are involved, the results are less impressive. For instance, with only two attributes, the predictions range from 25.9% to 86.7%.

### Process Discovery

Traditionally, process mining has focused on discovery, which involves deriving information about the original process model, organizational context, and execution properties from enactment logs. An example of a control flow perspective technique is the alpha algorithm, which constructs a Petri net model (Aalst, Weijters, Maruster, 2004) based on the observed behavior in the event log. For example, using a log like the one in Table 1, it is possible to discover the process model shown in Figure 1. Only the "Case" and "Task" columns are needed for this discovery.

### Conformance Checking

Conformance checking compares an a-priori model with the observed behavior recorded in the log. Rozinat and Aalst (2005) demonstrated how a process model (e.g., a Petri net) can be evaluated using metrics such as "fitness" (whether the observed behavior is possible according to the model) and "appropriateness" (whether the model is typical for the observed behavior). In the example, we could compare the observed behavior in Table 1 with the modeled behavior in Figure 1.

### Process Extension

Process extension involves adding additional perspectives to a given process model based on event logs. For example, decision mining (Rozinat, Aalst, 2006) analyzes how data attributes influence choices made in the process based on past executions. A process model can also be extended with timing information, such as bottleneck analysis, using timestamps in the log.

### The Three Types of Process Mining

Figure 3 illustrates the three types of process mining: discovery, conformance, and extension. Each type involves a model and an event log. In discovery, the process model is derived from the log data. In conformance and extension, an initial model is already present.

### ProM: A Powerful Process Analysis Tool

ProM (www.processmining.org) is a broad and powerful process analysis tool that supports various analyses related to business processes, including verification and error checking. Unlike many other tools, ProM focuses on real processes rather than modeled ones, extracting non-trivial and useful information from event logs. ProM is open source and offers a wide variety of plug-ins for process discovery, conformance checking, model extension, and transformation.

### Future Trends

In the future, it is expected that a wider spectrum of applications will manage processes in organizations. According to the Aberdeen Group, spending in the Business Process Management software sector reached $2.26 billion in 2001 (Cowley, 2002). We are currently extending and improving mining techniques, such as developing genetic algorithms for noisy logs and adding new functionality to the ProM framework.

### Conclusion

Business Process Management Systems, processes, workflows, and workflow systems are fundamental technological infrastructures that define, manage, and support business processes. Data generated from process execution and management can be used to discover and extract knowledge about process executions and structure. Path mining, which predicts the path followed during process execution, is an important area of analysis. Classification methods have proven effective for path mining in administrative and production processes.
