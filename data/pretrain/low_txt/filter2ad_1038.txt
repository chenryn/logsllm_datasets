## Abstract
The 2nd ACM Workshop on Information Sharing and Collaborative Security (WISCS’15) aims to advance the scientific foundations for sharing threat and security-related data among organizations. The call for better information sharing remains a significant theme in the computer security community and with policymakers, as it is expected to significantly improve the ability of defenders to detect and mitigate attacks on their networks and systems. Several commercial offerings by security vendors that enable automated sharing have been implemented, and existing communities have begun to use them.

Sharing security and threat data at scale raises several research questions, including how to best collect, analyze, and utilize these data to address important security concerns. Additionally, sharing raises privacy and other policy issues that need to be addressed. WISCS’15 brings together experts and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present innovative research, case studies, and legal and policy issues. The workshop is held in Denver, Colorado, USA, on October 12, 2015, in conjunction with the 22nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2015).

## Introduction
Improving security and threat-information sharing is seen as a crucial opportunity to enhance the defensive posture of organizations. Major cyber-attacks on US retailers, healthcare companies, and government agencies have led to the leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) about millions of users, emphasizing the urgency of accelerating information-sharing efforts. President Obama signed an Executive Order in February 2015, "Promoting Private Sector Cybersecurity Information Sharing," which includes tasking a standards organization with codifying the standards and guidelines for "Information Sharing Organizations (ISAOs)." This and other initiatives aim to make information sharing more accessible to a broader range of organizations.

To create effective information-sharing solutions, several technical and policy questions need to be addressed. For example, which data should enterprises share and with whom? Given the rapid nature of many cyber-attacks, automation is necessary to meet the requirements for speed and scale. Extracting the right information to share from the billions of security-related events (e.g., firewall logs, IDS alerts) collected daily in a typical enterprise is a challenging problem. It must be determined which data can be shared without inappropriately disclosing PII or information that could put the company at risk. For instance, if shared malware samples allow competitors, attackers, or regulatory agencies to infer specific vulnerabilities or breaches, this carries significant security, reputational, and legal risks. The public policy and civil liberties community has been debating these issues, and more research is needed to understand, quantify, and minimize these risks.

Other challenges include deriving high-quality "threat intelligence" from shared data. If false positive rates cannot be sufficiently controlled, defenders might be worse off with access to shared data, as noisy data can distract from real threats. To effectively use shared data, we need to better understand how organizations can make automated and effective use of it in their defenses. Much of the high-value information to be shared, such as descriptions of incidents, threat actors, campaigns, and mitigations, will be created and consumed by (human) security analysts who are often under significant time pressure. Therefore, getting the human-computer interaction (HCI) and user experience (UX) aspects of sharing platforms right is critical. These and other challenges place information sharing at the intersection of multiple disciplines within computer science and policy research.

This year’s workshop, the second in its series, aims to be at the forefront of these developments, serving as the premier forum for presenting research results in collaborative security, privacy, and confidentiality, as well as legal and policy issues. The workshop also includes two case studies of innovative information-sharing initiatives, fostering fruitful discussions among practitioners and researchers in this field.

## Program Format
WISCS’15 is a one-day workshop held in Denver, Colorado, USA, on October 12, 2015, as a pre-conference event for the 22nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2015). The workshop opens with a one-hour keynote, "Real World Information Exchange: Challenges and Insights," by Freddy Dezeure, Head of CERT-EU. The keynote is followed by six full paper and two short paper presentations. Each presentation is allocated 30 minutes, followed by a 10-minute discussion. All submissions were peer-reviewed by at least three program committee members. The workshop received 16 submissions, of which eight were accepted for presentation.

## Conclusion
WISCS is the first workshop dedicated solely to the scientific aspects of sharing threat and security-related data.
