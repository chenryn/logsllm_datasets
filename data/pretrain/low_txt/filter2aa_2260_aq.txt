### Charlotte Urban Area Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

**Summary:**
- **Governance:** Established Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

**January 2007**

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
The Charlotte Urban Area (UA) has successfully implemented SOPs for tactical interoperable communications through the TICP Implementation Workshop. Additional steps, such as storing applicable SOPs with radio caches and gateways, support the continued dissemination and implementation of these SOPs. The UA has been using the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) for over a year, allowing agencies to develop proficiency. During the TICP validation exercise, the Charlotte UA demonstrated NIMS/ICS, including the newly incorporated Communications Unit Leader (COML) position. A unified command was established with Incident Commanders representing each jurisdictional agency, and a COML was designated and announced to all relevant personnel.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to maintain and update SOPs (e.g., after scheduled tabletop communications exercises) to include policies for new equipment and disseminate them to all organizations.
- Ensure regional SOPs are aligned with statewide planning efforts.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (including communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage
The Charlotte UA successfully used all available communications interoperability methods (e.g., radio caches, shared channels, gateways, shared systems) during its TICP validation exercise. While interoperable communications equipment is not used daily, the UA included all 11 counties in the exercise. The exercise was one of the most inclusive in terms of local agency participation. However, it did not provide an opportunity to demonstrate interoperable communications with federal agencies. The UA is encouraged to build on this success by integrating state, federal, and support agencies in future events.

**Recommendations:**
- Involve public safety support disciplines, state, and federal agencies in training and exercises.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

#### Technology Overview
The Charlotte UA hosts 29 separate radio systems, including VHF, UHF, and 800 MHz systems. The City of Charlotte is serviced by the Charlotte/Mecklenburg 800 MHz Radio System, which supports public safety agencies from both the City of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County. Interoperability is provided through cached radios, gateways, and shared channels. The UA is working to incorporate Union and Gaston County into the Charlotte/Mecklenburg radio system using the existing Motorola SmartZone™ 4.1 zone controller to interconnect their 800 MHz systems and establish a shared system.

### Cincinnati/Hamilton Urban Area Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

**Summary:**
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Intermediate Implementation
- **Usage:** Intermediate Implementation

**January 2007**

#### Governance
The SOSINK (Southwestern Ohio, Southeastern Indiana, and Northern Kentucky) region established a communications subcommittee under the Terrorism Preparedness Advisory Team to create the TICP in October 2005. The committee includes representatives from most local agencies within the UA counties. Formal mutual aid agreements exist among local agencies, but there are no interstate agreements among Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. A regional strategic plan for interoperable communications is critical to ensure region-wide interoperability, which currently does not exist. The UA should consider a longer-term, diversified, and sustainable funding strategy. Currently, the UA receives funding from federal grants, and leadership has allocated a significant portion of these funds to communications interoperability equipment.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to involve state and federal organizations (e.g., Kentucky and Indiana State Police, FBI) in the committee and develop a charter to establish roles, responsibilities, and authority.
- Document and formalize agreements (e.g., MOUs) among all participating agencies, particularly interstate agreements.
- Develop, document, and implement a consensus tri-state regional strategic plan with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance.
- Develop and implement a regional approach to long-term (3-5 years) interoperability planning and sustainable funding.
- Identify champions from each state to establish a governance structure that supports a unified tri-state regional approach.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
The TICP represents the first formal interoperable communications regional SOP for the Cincinnati/Hamilton UA. Some steps have been taken to implement these SOPs, and plans are in place to further distribute the TICP to tri-state area public safety agencies. The UA is working toward implementing NIMS/ICS, and SOSINK is assisting with NIMS/ICS training. The UA demonstrated familiarity with command and control communications during the TICP validation exercise but requires continued training for proficiency.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to develop and disseminate tri-state regional interoperability SOPs, and train all participating agencies.
- Involve additional state and federal agencies in the development of tri-state Regional SOPs.
- Identify and document existing SOPs in the TICP.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage
The Cincinnati/Hamilton UA regularly uses a shared system that provides communications interoperability across four of the eight Ohio counties in the area and among counties in Kentucky and Indiana. Historically, there has not been a need for interoperable communications among all 12 counties. During the TICP validation exercise, the UA demonstrated familiarity with other available interoperability equipment, despite issues with radio caches.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources to improve proficiency.
- Practice multijurisdictional and multidiscipline communications during future exercises and day-to-day activities, including all 12 counties.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of future exercises in the tri-state area.

#### Technology Overview
All public safety agencies in the City of Cincinnati and Hamilton County operate on a shared, Project 25, digital 800 MHz radio system. Disparate systems are common throughout the rest of the SOSINK UA. The City/County has identified interoperable communication links with surrounding agencies, such as NPSPAC channels, gateways, and shared frequencies.

### Cleveland Urban Area Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

**Summary:**
- **Governance:** Early Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Intermediate Implementation
- **Usage:** Intermediate Implementation

**January 2007**

#### Governance
The Cuyahoga County Emergency Services Advisory Board has an informal communications subcommittee addressing interoperability, consisting of regional fire, law enforcement, and public health representatives. There are no published and active agreements among regional agencies, although the UA plans to implement the TICP as the area’s first formal agreement once it is adopted. The decision-making group informally recruits public safety support agencies and has limited involvement with the Cleveland Mayor’s office. A technical communications study was conducted in 2002, but it is not clearly defined as the UA’s formal strategic plan. Funding for interoperable communications is mainly through federal grants, with no long-term funding plan. Coordination and cooperation among individual jurisdictions are not well established.

**Recommendations:**
- Establish a regular meeting schedule and membership, define roles and responsibilities, and include all agencies.
- Develop and document necessary agreements (e.g., MOUs) that include local, state, and federal agencies.
- Develop a strategic plan beyond the technical study and operational focus of the TICP with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance.
- Develop a regional approach to long-term (3-5 years) communications interoperability planning and sustainable funding.
- Involve a high-level official with political and fiscal authority to advocate for and focus on communications interoperability.
- Establish a direct line of communication among local and state level organizations to advocate the importance of interoperable communications.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
The Cleveland UA’s TICP represents the first formal interoperable communications regional SOPs for the area. Participation in the development of the TICP was limited, and the TICP has not yet been finalized and formally accepted. The UA is in the process of implementing NIMS/ICS and has begun training for various public safety disciplines. However, the UA demonstrated deficiencies during the TICP validation exercise, such as delays in establishing a command post and issues with COMLs.

**Recommendations:**
- Adopt the TICP as the regional communications plan.
- Disseminate and train personnel on regional SOPs, ensuring consistency with regional and statewide planning efforts.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage
The Cleveland UA demonstrated familiarity and successful use of interoperable communications equipment during the TICP validation exercise. However, several deficiencies were noted, such as issues with radio caches and gateways, and difficulties in setting up talk groups and handling traffic. In a recent real-world event (blackout in 2003), the UA had difficulty establishing interoperable communications across agencies and jurisdictions.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperable communications resources to improve proficiency.
- Involve additional local, state, and federal agencies in training and exercises.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

#### Technology Overview
In the UA, the City of Cleveland and remaining agencies in Cuyahoga County operate 20 VHF, 20 UHF, and seven 800 MHz radio systems. Interoperability is achieved by sharing radios, gateways, and channels (NPSPAC and MARCS). Various agencies have access to the State of Ohio MARCS 800 MHz digital trunked system’s radios for command and control during multi-agency incidents. The City of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County are developing the Cuyahoga Area-wide Radio System (CARS), a countywide Project 25-compliant 800 MHz digital trunked system.

#### Governance
The Franklin County Board of Commissioners and the Mayor of the City of Columbus have prioritized public safety communications and developed a governance structure focused on tactical communications interoperability. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee, established by them, created subcommittees for interoperable communications, operational, and training issues. The governance structure has been in place since 1995 and has been refined through work with COPS in 2003 and more recently through the TICP process. The Columbus UA has an interoperability strategic plan in place, accepted by all participating agencies. Political leaders have provided policy and fiscal support, and budgeting is based on regional needs. Agencies have agreed to support their own operational and maintenance costs following the expiration of equipment warranty periods.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to recruit and involve organizations, even if they are not specifically involved in the decision-making group.
- Implement the review and revision of strategic plans (beyond 1 year) according to the needs of the UA.
- Encourage a regional interoperability funding strategy, including sources for long-term goals.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
The Columbus UA has had communications interoperability SOPs in place for over a decade, and all existing SOPs were incorporated into the TICP. The UA used the TICP development process to update and enhance its policies and has been aggressive in disseminating these policies through bi-monthly training sessions for member agencies. NIMS/ICS has been implemented for over a year, and the UA has successfully used these procedures.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to maintain and update SOPs and disseminate them to all organizations.
- Ensure regional SOPs are aligned with statewide planning efforts.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage
The Columbus UA has successfully used all available communications interoperability methods and demonstrated proficiency in NIMS/ICS during the TICP validation exercise. The UA is encouraged to continue testing and exercising deployment of regional interoperability resources to maintain and improve proficiency.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperable communications resources.
- Involve additional local, state, and federal agencies in training and exercises.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.
