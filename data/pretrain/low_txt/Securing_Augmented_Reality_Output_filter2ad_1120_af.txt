### Introduction to AR Security and Privacy

The computer security research community has recently identified the need to address security and privacy concerns in emerging Augmented Reality (AR) systems, as highlighted in several studies [8, 39]. Arya builds on recent advancements in this field, particularly focusing on limiting AR applications' access to potentially sensitive sensor data [18, 19, 36, 40, 45].

Related work, such as SurroundWeb [51], allows applications to project onto surfaces in a room but primarily addresses privacy concerns (e.g., preventing the sharing of video information about the room) rather than output security. PrePose [11] supports defining new input gestures (e.g., hand motions) while mitigating privacy and security threats from sensing applications.

To date, most research on AR security and privacy has focused on input-related issues. In contrast, Arya focuses on output security. It builds on prior work that identified the need to securely handle AR output and leverages the AR object model from that work [21], but delves deeper into uncovering and addressing additional fundamental challenges.

### Related Work

MacIntyre et al. [24] proposed an earlier version of AR objects without a focus on security. Greenberg et al. [14] discuss "dark" design patterns in ubiquitous proximity-based computing, some of which (e.g., "captive audience") are related to the AR output threats we consider. Ng-Thow-Hing et al. [34] provide design guidelines for automotive AR applications, including measures to limit distraction, which can be enforced by Arya's policies.

Researchers have previously considered the challenge of constraining and securing application output in more traditional platforms [10, 38, 43]. While AR platforms can build on lessons from these prior platforms, the existence of virtual 3D objects that can overlay on the user's view of the real world raises new challenges.

### Conclusion

Immersive augmented reality technologies, such as head-mounted displays like Microsoft’s HoloLens or automotive windshields, are becoming a commercial reality. Although the computer security research community has begun to address input-related risks with emerging AR platforms, little attention has been given to output risks. Our work addresses these risks, such as buggy or malicious applications that create virtual content that obscures the user's view of the real world (or the virtual content from other applications) in undesirable or unsafe ways.

To mitigate these risks, we designed, implemented, and evaluated Arya, an AR platform that supports multiple applications simultaneously augmenting the user's view of the world. Arya's primary contribution is the design of an output policy module that constrains AR application output according to specified policies (e.g., preventing virtual content from obscuring a real-world person). We identified and overcame numerous challenges in designing an AR output policy specification and evaluation framework that supports composable, effective, and efficient policies. We evaluated our prototype implementation of Arya with prototype policies drawn from various sources. Our findings indicate that Arya prevents undesirable behavior in case study applications, and the performance overhead of policy enforcement is acceptable even in our unoptimized prototype.

Now is the time to consider the security and privacy risks raised by emerging AR technologies. Modifying the user's view of the world is a key feature of AR applications, and if left unconstrained, this ability can raise serious risks. We argue that future AR platforms must address these issues to safely and securely support multiple, simultaneously running applications, as well as continuous use of immersive AR as the user moves through the physical world. The design challenges we raise in this paper, and the solutions we propose through Arya, represent a promising step towards secure AR output.
