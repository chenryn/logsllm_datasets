### VII. Discussion

The provided metric offers only a rough correlation with guess resistance and is unable to accurately predict the quantitative differences in guessability among various password sets.

### Appendix

#### Weir Algorithm Experiments

The following table details the complete training and test data used in each of our Weir-algorithm experiments. The first column gives the experiment number. The next three columns list the three types of training data used to create a Weir-calculator experiment. The structures column shows the wordlists used to generate the set of character-type structures that define the Weir algorithm’s search space. The wordlists in the digits and symbols column determine the probabilities for filling combinations of digits and symbols into these structures. The wordlists in the strings column determine the probabilities for filling alphabetic strings into structures. In most cases, we train strings on as much data as possible, while restricting structure and digit/symbol training to wordlists that contain a quality sample of multi-character-class passwords. The final column describes the password set(s) we attempted to guess.

| Experiment | Structures | Digits and Symbols | Strings | Testing Set |
|------------|------------|--------------------|---------|-------------|
| MS         | MS         | MS, RY             | MS, RY  | MS, RY      |
| MS, RY     | MS, RY     | MS, RY             | MS, RY  | MS, RY, OW  |
| MS8        | MS8        | MS8                | MS8     | MS8         |
| MSC        | MS16       | MS8, OW8           | MS16, OW16 | MS, W2, I  |
| ...        | ...        | ...                | ...     | ...         |

#### BFM Experiments

The following table details the complete training and test data used in each of our BFM experiments. The experiment number and test set columns are the same as in the Weir subtable. Training for the BFM calculator, however, uses only one combined wordlist per experiment; these lists are detailed in the training set column.

| Experiment | Test Set   | Training Set    |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| B1         | 1000-All   | RY, MS, I       |
| B2         | 500-All    | RY, MS, I, 500-All |
| B3         | 1000-B8    | RY, MS, I, 2000-B8 |
| B4         | 1000-C8    | RY, MS, I, 2000-C8 |
