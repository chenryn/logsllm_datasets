### Nodes without Going Through the Core

Approximately 80% of autonomous systems (ASes) in the Internet are located at the edge. Additionally, we will demonstrate in the next subsection that about 68% of Tdown events originate from the edge. Consequently, we expect that the edge-to-edge (edge → edge) case reflects the majority of slow routing convergence observed in the Internet.

### 4.3 Origin of Fail-Down Events

We now examine the origin of Tdown events within the Internet hierarchy. Given that the set of Tdown events is expected to be common across all 32 monitors in our dataset (Section 3), we will use a single monitor, specifically the router 144.228.241.81 from Sprint, for this analysis. Similar results are obtained from other monitors.

Since our dataset spans a one-month period, it is possible that during this time, a high-impact event could have triggered an abnormal number of Tdown failures, potentially biasing our results. Figure 19 plots the cumulative number of Tdown events as observed by the monitor during January 2006. The cumulative number of events grows linearly, with an approximate constant rate of 3,600 Tdown events per day. This uniform distribution over time suggests that most fail-down events have a random nature.

Table 3 breaks down Tdown events by the tier from which they originate. We observe that about 68% of the events originate at the edge. However, the edge also announces approximately 56% of the prefixes. To assess the stability of each tier, and since our identification of events is based on prefixes, a simple event count is insufficient. A better measure is to divide the number of events originating from each tier by the total number of prefixes originated from that tier. As shown in the "No. events per prefix" line in Table 3, if the core originates \( n \) events per prefix, the middle originates \( 2n \) and the edge originates \( 3n \) such events, yielding the interesting proportion 1:2:3. This indicates that, generally, prefixes in the middle are twice as unstable as those in the core, and prefixes at the edge are three times as unstable as those in the core.

| Tier   | No. of Events | No. of Prefixes Originated | No. of Events per Prefix |
|--------|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Core   | 34,514        | 3,011                     | 0.21                    |
| Middle | 14,367        | 81,988                    | 0.42                    |
| Edge   | 78,149        | 122,877                   | 0.63                    |

### 5. Related Work

There are two types of BGP update characterization work in the literature: passive measurements [13, 14, 11, 26, 3, 16, 23, 27, 7] and active measurements [10, 12, 17]. The work presented in this paper falls into the first category. We conducted a systematic measurement to classify routing instability events and quantify path exploration for all prefixes in the Internet. Our measurement also showed the impact of AS tier levels on the extent of path explorations.

Existing measurements of path exploration and slow convergence have been based on active measurements [10, 12, 17], where controlled events were injected into the Internet from a small number of beacon sites. These measurement results demonstrated the existence of BGP path exploration and slow convergence but did not show the extent of these phenomena under real operational conditions. In contrast, our paper classifies routing events of all prefixes, rather than a small number of beacon sites, into different categories and provides measurement results on updates per event and event durations. By examining updates from multiple peers for all prefixes in the global routing table, we can identify the impact of AS tier levels on path exploration. Our results align with previous active measurement work [12] that preﬁxes originated from tier-1 ASes tend to experience less slow convergence compared to those from lower-tier ASes. Moreover, our results show that, for the same prefix, routers of different AS tiers observe different degrees of slow convergence, with tier-1 ASes seeing much less than lower-tier ASes.

Existing passive measurements have studied the instability of all prefixes, focusing on update inter-arrival time, event duration, location of instability, and characterization of individual updates [13, 14, 11, 26, 3, 16, 23, 27, 7]. There is no prior work on classifying routing events according to their effects (e.g., whether the path becomes better or worse after the event). Our paper describes a novel path preference heuristic based on path usage time and studies the characteristics of different classes of instability events in the Internet.

Our approach shares similarities with [23, 27, 7] in using a timeout-based approach to group updates into events. This approach can mistakenly group updates from multiple root causes that occur close to each other or overlap in time into a single event. As discussed earlier, the events in our Path-Disturbance category can be examples of grouping updates with overlapping root causes because the path to a prefix changed at least twice, and often more, during one event. We advanced this approach by detecting and separating these overlapping events into a different category. It is likely that Path-Change events with very long durations are also overlapping events, and one way to identify them is to set a time threshold on the event duration, which we plan to do in the future.

### 6. Conclusions

We conducted the first systematic measurement study to quantify the existence of path exploration and slow convergence in the global Internet routing system. We developed a new path ranking method based on the usage time of each path and validated its effectiveness using data from controlled experiments with beacon prefixes. We then applied our path ranking method to BGP updates of all prefixes in the global routing table and classified each observed routing event into three classes: Path Change, Path Disturbance, and Same Path. For Path Change events, we further classified them into four sub-categories: Tdown, Tup, Tlong, and Tshort. We measured the path exploration, convergence duration, and update count for each type of event.

Our work shows several significant results. First, although there is widespread path exploration and slow convergence in the global routing system, the significance of the problem varies considerably depending on the locations of both the origin ASes and the observation routers in the routing system hierarchy. Generally, routers in tier-1 ISPs observe less path exploration and shorter convergence delays than routers in edge ASes, and prefixes originated from tier-1 ISPs experience much less slow convergence than those from edge ASes.

Second, Tlong events generally have short durations comparable to Tup and Tshort events. This aligns with our previous theoretical analysis [19] and departs from widely accepted views based on previous experiments [10]. Furthermore, our data shows that Same Path events account for about 34% of the total routing events, which is an alarmingly high value. Since this class of events is likely caused by internal routing changes within individual ASes, many of them should not exist in the first place. Further investigations are needed to better understand the causes of Same Path events. We also observed that about 30% of routing events are due to transient route changes (captured as path disturbance events in our measurement) and are responsible for nearly half of all routing updates (47%). Identifying the causes of these transient routing changes would help further stabilize the global routing system.
