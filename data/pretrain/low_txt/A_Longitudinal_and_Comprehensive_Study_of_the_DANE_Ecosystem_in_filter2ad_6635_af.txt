### 6.3 Summary

In summary, DANE support among 29 popular email service providers is limited: only five of them support DANE for incoming emails, and four support it for outgoing emails. Among the four providers that support DANE for both incoming and outgoing emails, one relies on external DNSSEC-aware resolvers, which may be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. On a positive note, DANE support in widely used MTA and DNS software is more prevalent. All tested MTAs support STARTTLS for incoming emails, and two of them validate presented certificates with TLSA records for outgoing emails. Additionally, seven DNS programs support both DNSSEC and TLSA records. For the remaining DNS programs that do not support DNSSEC and DANE, such as djbdns and posadis, their latest versions were released over 15 years ago, and MaraDNS, despite recent updates, still lacks DANE support. Therefore, administrators of email service providers can easily enhance DANE support by updating and configuring their MTA and DNS software.

### 7 Conclusion

This paper presents a longitudinal and comprehensive study of the DANE ecosystem in SMTP, encompassing 178 million second-level domains and 29 popular email service providers, to understand the security implications of DANE management. Our findings include:
1. DANE deployment is scarce but increasing.
2. More than one-third of all TLSA records cannot be validated due to missing or incorrect DNSSEC records.
3. 14% of the certificates are inconsistent with their TLSA records.

On the SMTP client side, we evaluated 29 popular email service providers and found that only four support DANE for both outgoing and incoming emails, and one supports it only for incoming emails. We also tested four MTA and ten DNS software programs, and found that two of the MTAs and seven of the DNS programs correctly support DANE, indicating that administrators willing to deploy DANE would not face significant operational challenges.

### A. Terminology

In this section, we provide a glossary of terms and their definitions:

- **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**: A protocol for internet electronic mail transmission. Mail servers (or Mail Transfer Agents) use SMTP to send and receive emails.
- **MX Record**: A DNS record that specifies which mail servers are willing to act as a mail exchange for the associated domain.
- **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)**: Software that transfers email messages; it receives incoming emails from sources and delivers outgoing emails to their destinations.
- **Domain Name System (DNS)**: A hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers or other resources connected to the Internet. It associates various resources (e.g., IP addresses) with domain names.
- **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**: Domains under the root zone in DNS. A second-level domain name comes after the dot, such as .com and .se.
- **Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD)**: One of the categories of TLD, reserved for a country or territory identified with a country code, such as .se, .nl.
- **Generic Top-Level Domain (gTLD)**: One of the categories of TLD, not country-specific but paired with different classes or organizations, such as .com, .net.
