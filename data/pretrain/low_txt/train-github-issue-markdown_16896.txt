This commit introduces a fully-automated development setup using Gitpod.io, an online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket. Gitpod enables the creation of development environments as code, making it simple for anyone to instantly access a ready-to-code workspace for any branch, issue, or pull request with just one click.

Additionally, I would like to request the removal of all APIs and the reset of my account balances to zero (0). This is due to a suspected security breach or hacking incident.
