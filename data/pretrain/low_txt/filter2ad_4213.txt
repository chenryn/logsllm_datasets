### Keynote I: Advances in Memory State-Preserving Fault Tolerance

**Author: Tzi-cker Chiueh**

**Abstract:**
Memory state-preserving fault tolerance (MPFT) allows a running process to continue without disruption, even in the event of hardware or operating system failures. This is achieved through continuous virtual machine migration and an epoch-based execution model. Despite the availability of commercial MPFT implementations, their real-world adoption has been limited due to significant performance penalties. In this talk, I will first discuss the main limitations of existing MPFT implementations and then present an open-source implementation that not only supports all basic MPFT functionalities but also overcomes these limitations.

### Keynote II: Future of Network and Service Automation: Resiliency Challenges for Communicating to the Limit

**Abstract:**
We are entering an era of profound human progress driven by digitalization. Digital transformation necessitates new requirements that place the network at the center, connecting everything, providing compute wherever needed, and applying insights for precise execution. To achieve this, networks must be capable of simultaneous, reliable, and secure connections, even as the number, diversity, and operating conditions change. Innovations in network automation and new network-as-a-service platforms will be crucial for Communication Service Providers (CSPs) to become the Digital Service Providers (DSPs) of the future. This talk will highlight the key challenges and innovations required to create a resilient, hyper-connected, and automated network.

### Keynote III: Reliable Quantum Computing Needs Intelligent Software and Hardware

**Abstract:**
Quantum computers can solve commercially important problems beyond the capability of conventional computers. With small systems demonstrating a few dozen qubits and the number expected to increase to several hundred in the coming years, quantum computing is at a critical inflection point. However, qubits, being low-energy devices, are prone to high error rates (ranging from 0.1% to 1% per operation). Quantum error correction, while necessary, incurs a significant overhead, making it impractical for near-term machines. Consequently, hardware errors will continue to limit the length of programs that can be reliably executed on near-term quantum computers. In this talk, I will provide a computer-systems perspective on quantum computers and share recent work that enhances the reliability of near-term quantum computers using intelligent software techniques. I will also discuss the hardware support required for large-scale quantum computers.
