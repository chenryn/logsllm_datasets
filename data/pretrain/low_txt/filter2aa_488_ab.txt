# Prerequisites
- Software-Defined Radio (SDR), USRP N210
- GNU Radio
- Tuned Antenna
- System for testing, e.g., Honeywell

# Tuning
- **Spectrum Analyzer**
  - Dedicated
  - Built with SDR
  - Consult FCC documentation

# Jamming
- **Spot Jamming**
  - Blast noise! :D
  - It works? Really?
  - Manufacturers are aware of the threat
    - Introducing ‘RF Jam’
    - Once enabled, the spot jammer fails

# Periodic Jamming
- At what point does the interference go from benign to malicious?
  - Noise floor
  - Number of malformed transmissions

# Noise Floor Testing
- How long can the spot jammer be used?
  - About a minute
  - Check the noise floor

# Malformed Packet Testing
- In GNU Radio Companion (GRC), layout a flow chart that flips bits
  - Induce errors
  - Low duty cycle

# On/Off Timing
- How quickly can we turn simple jamming on and off?
  - Pretty quick, about ¼ of a second
  - Is that good?
    - Yes
    - Supervisory transmission requires 0.77 seconds
    - Alarm transmission requires 3.54 seconds

# Outcomes
- **RF Jam Disabled**
  - Covert infiltration and exfiltration
- **RF Jam Enabled**
  - Covert infiltration, exfiltration, and alarm triggering
  - When enabled, RF Jam is a liability

# SIGINT (Signals Intelligence)
- **Tiers of Complexity**
  - RF Capture
  - Bitstream
  - Protocol Capture
  - We know what that means

## RF Capture
- Simple in GRC
  - Useful if more intelligence is available

## Bitstream Capture
- **Bitstream to Packets**
  - Helpful if more intelligence is available
  - From the FCC
  - Manchester encoded
  - 3200 Baud
  - Word length: 64 bits
  - Packets are repeated to form a transmission

### Bitstream to Packets
- Just Software
  - Read bitstream from stdin
  - Figure out the number of samples per bit
  - Convert samples to bits
  - Manchester decode and print

## Honeywell Door Packets
- 0xfffe84d40280512c
- 0xfffe84d402a0d1ef
- 0xfffe84d402e0506c
- 0xfffe8faa83804d3d
- 0xfffe8faa83a0cdfe
- 0xfffe8faa83e04c7d

# Reverse Engineering
- 0xfffe
  - In every packet
  - Looks like a preamble and sync bit
- 0x{80, a0, e0}
  - All three appear for both sensors
  - 0xa0 – Open Event
  - 0x80 – Closed Event
  - 0xe0 – Tamper Event
- 0x{84d402, 8faa83}
  - Unique to each sensor, in every packet
  - 0x84d402 – No significance, but 0x84d402 = 316,418 in decimal
  - 316,418 corresponds to A031P6418
  - 0x8faa83 corresponds to A102P6691
- 0x{512c, d1ef, 506c, 4d3d, cdfe, 4c7d}
  - Different for each packet seen
  - Probably a CRC, time to break it out… REVENG
- **CRC Reversing with REVENG**
  - Arbitrary-precision CRC calculator and algorithm finder
  - Search every packet for a one-byte or two-byte CRC
  - Easy bash script…

# Reverse Engineering
- 0xfffe84d40280512c
  - 0xfffe – Preamble and sync bit
  - 0x84d402 – Serial
  - 0x80 – Event type
  - 0x512c – CRC16/BUYPASS

# Outcomes
- **Monitoring Capability**
  - Helps with Situational Awareness
  - How?
    - Different sensors transmit different events
    - Sensors are installed in logical locations

# Replay
- What does this get us?
  - Induce behavior with false alarms

# Application to Three Systems
