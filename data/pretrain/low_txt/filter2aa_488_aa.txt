# Home Insecurity: No Alarms, False Alarms, and SIGINT

## Agenda
- Motivation
- Models and Methodology
- Attack Primitive Implementation
- Application to Three Security Systems
- Observations
- Conclusion

## Who Am I?
- Researcher at the Center for Trustworthy Embedded Systems, ORNL
- Current focus on V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) systems
- Ongoing privacy research in intelligent transportation systems

## Value of Home Security Systems
- **Protection**: Ostensibly protects your home and occupants from intruders.
  - **Previous Hacks**:
    - Disabling sensors
    - Controlling GSM
    - Exploiting Z-Wave (Home Automation)
- **Insurance Benefits**: Lower insurance premiums

## Motivation
- **Complete Dominance of the Security System**
  - Render it useless
  - Make owning a security system a liability
- **Covert Infiltration and Exfiltration**
  - Monitoring the company and occupants
- **Behavioral Monitoring and Induction**
  - Specific occupants (better for homes)
  - Aggregate (better for businesses)

## Models and Methodology

### Adversary Model
- **Desires**:
  - General solution
  - High yield
  - Cost-effective
  - A wireless hack
  - Sub-GHz RF is similar across manufacturers and highly vulnerable
  - Everything is going wireless
  - SDRs (Software-Defined Radios) are becoming cheaper, and software is cost-effective

- **Capabilities**:
  - Covert Infiltration and Exfiltration: Attempt with Jamming
  - Behavioral Monitoring: Attempt with SIGINT (Signals Intelligence)
  - Behavioral Induction: Accomplish with Replay

- **Constraints**:
  - Only use Software-Defined Radio
  - No firmware dumping (black box testing)
  - No crafting custom messages
  - No protocol fuzzing or packets of death

- **Rationale for Constraints**:
  - Easy to commodify these attacks if successful
  - Relax constraints if the adversary needs to be more sophisticated

### Security System Model
- **Focus**: Intra-system communications
- **Types of Intra-Home Communications**:
  - **Vulnerable**:
    - Legacy sub-GHz communications
  - **Secure**:
    - All other types

- **Types of Devices in a System**:
  - **Sensors**: Trigger events even when the system is disarmed, one-way communication
  - **Alarm Devices**: Alert occupants and/or monitoring company
  - **Bridges**: Convert one type of communication to another
  - **Other**

- **Interesting Properties**:
  - Sensors trigger their events even when the system is disarmed
  - Sensors have one-way communication
  - Only alarm devices can alert stakeholders

- **Directed Graph**:
  - Vertices: Devices (Sensors, Alarm Devices, Bridges)
  - Edges: Communication channels (Vulnerable wireless, others)
  - Transmissions flow from sources (sensors) to sinks (alarm devices)

### Honeywell Devices
- **Honeywell Digraph**:
  - **Sensors**:
    - 5 total: 2 Door, 3 Motion
  - **Alarm Devices**:
    - 2 total: 1 Keypad, 1 Control Panel

## Methodology
1. Identify all devices and their communication types
2. Generate a digraph from sources to sinks
3. If there are any wireless communications, attempt the SIGINT attack primitive
4. If a path exists from source to sink involving a wireless communication channel, attempt the Jamming and Replay attack primitives
5. Evaluate the achieved level of control and situational awareness

## Attack Primitive Implementation

### Prerequisites
