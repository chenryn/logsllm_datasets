### Security Analysis of EMV Contactless Protocols

#### Introduction
In the context of transitioning from online to offline transactions, a terminal may accept a transaction without verifying its correctness. The issuing bank will later detect any mismatching Application Cryptogram (AC). This scenario violates both properties formalized in Definitions 1 and 2.

Surprisingly, all but one configuration of the Visa contactless protocol fail to provide adequate security. The Visa protocol, as depicted in Figure 2, includes a secure configuration, Visa DDA High, where all bracketed terms, especially the Signed Dynamic Application Data (SDAD), are present. The insecure configuration, Visa DDA Low, which applies to offline transactions, can be exploited similarly to the issues found with Mastercard.

#### Critical Violations in Visa Configurations
Particularly critical is the violation of authentication in the Visa EMV High configuration (Table II, Line 2, Remark 1), which applies to high-value transactions. In this configuration, the bracketed terms in the card's last message are not present. Our Tamarin analysis identified a trace for an accepted transaction where neither the terminal nor the bank agreed with the card on the Card Transaction Qualifiers (CTQ). The CTQ, a card-sourced data object, instructs the terminal on the Cardholder Verification Method (CVM) to use (see [32], p. 97). The trace showed that while the card's view of the CTQ requested online PIN verification, the terminal's view indicated that the Consumer Device CVM (CDCVM) was performed, leading the terminal to consider the cardholder successfully verified (see [32], pp. 68–69). This flaw is possible because the CTQ lacks cryptographic protection, allowing an attacker to bypass the PIN for a victim’s Visa card, as mentioned in the introduction.

Bypassing the PIN by enforcing the CDCVM in Mastercard transactions is not possible because the card's support for this CVM is determined by the second bit of the Application Interchange Profile (AIP)'s first byte. The AIP is authenticated through the AC and, if present, the SDAD. Modifying this data object would result in a declined transaction.

#### Secrecy Analysis
In terms of secrecy, the results are consistent across all models. Private and shared keys, as well as the PIN, remain secret, while the Primary Account Number (PAN) is not.

**Summary:**
Our analysis confirms that Mastercard transactions using Combined Data Authentication (CDA) are secure, which is fortunate given their prevalence. In contrast, significant flaws were found in commonly used configurations of the Visa protocol. These flaws can be exploited in practical attacks, which we describe in the next section.

### Attack and Defense

#### Security Shortcomings in EMV
Our analysis of EMV's security uncovered numerous serious shortcomings, particularly in EMV contactless protocols. Tampering with the card-terminal contactless channel over NFC is simpler than tampering with the contact chip. In this section, we demonstrate how these issues can be exploited by an attacker to carry out fraudulent transactions and suggest fixes for secure contactless transactions.

#### Setup
We developed a proof-of-concept Android application to demonstrate the practical impact of the shortcomings uncovered by our formal analysis. Our application supports man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on top of a relay attack architecture, as shown in Figure 3. The attacker uses two mobile devices: one running our app in Point-Of-Sale (POS) emulator mode and the other in card emulator mode. Both devices must have NFC support and run Android 4.4 KitKat (API level 19) or later. The card emulator device must support Android's Host-based Card Emulation (HCE) [35].

To conduct the attacks, the POS emulator must be held near the card to be attacked, and the card emulator must be held near the payment terminal. The two emulators communicate wirelessly through a TCP/IP socket channel over WiFi. The MITM attack modifies:
- The inbound commands read from the wireless channel before delivering them to the card through the NFC channel.
- The card's responses before transmitting them to the card emulator through the WiFi channel.

#### Bypassing Cardholder Verification
In a Visa contactless transaction, the card's response to the terminal's GET PROCESSING OPTIONS command carries the Card Transaction Qualifiers (CTQ). The CTQ is a 2-byte data object that instructs the terminal on the CVM to use. As explained in Section V-B, our analysis revealed that the card does not authenticate the CTQ to either the terminal or the bank (Table II, Line 2, Remark 1). Our app exploits this and implements a MITM attack that:
- Clears the 8th bit of CTQ's first byte, indicating that online PIN verification is not required.
- Sets the 8th bit of CTQ's second byte, indicating that the CDCVM was performed.

Using our app, we successfully carried out several real-world, PIN-less transactions with amounts greater than the domestic CVM-required limit with Visa credit and debit cards. Figure 4 shows screenshots of our app, and a video demonstration of the attack for a 200 CHF transaction is available on [36].

Our attack should also work for EMV Contactless Kernels 6 (Discover) and 7 (UnionPay), though these have not been tested yet. To avoid defrauding others, all tests were conducted with our own debit/credit cards, and all purchased goods were paid for in full.

As discussed in Section II, Galloway and Yunusov [28] presented another MITM attack at BlackHat Europe that bypasses Visa's PIN verification. Unlike our attack, their attack does not clear the 8th bit of CTQ's first byte but instead clears the 7th bit of the Terminal Transaction Qualifiers' (TTQ) second byte, which tells the card whether the terminal requires cardholder verification for the transaction (see [32], p. 115).

The TTQ is a terminal-sourced data object passed to the card within the payload of the GET PROCESSING OPTIONS command. According to the EMV Security and Key Management book [34] (p. 88), the AC is a MAC computed on the data referenced by the card's data object lists, such as the PDOL. Our Tamarin analysis does not report the attack of [28] because the generic AC should prevent the modification of the PDOL and TTQ. However, Visa's proprietary AC does not, as noted in [28]. Our attack works even if the TTQ is authenticated, as it requires no modification.

Another difference between our attack and that of [28] is in the implementation. Their prototype uses two wired Raspberry Pi boards, which is conspicuous and not easily usable outside a lab environment. In contrast, our proof-of-concept is a seemingly innocuous phone app that can be easily used in live, attended terminals. Moreover, unlike Galloway and Yunusov's attack, ours does not require the card and payment terminal to be physically close. Our app can be extended to cover overseas distances. Surprisingly, Visa has shown no intention to fix these vulnerabilities, as noted in [28].

Both our attack and that of [28] assume the attacker's device is within NFC proximity of the victim's card. These attacks can be carried out by acquiring the actual card (e.g., stealing it or finding it if lost) or by holding the POS emulator near the card in the victim's possession.

#### Unauthenticated Offline Transactions
For all low-value transactions of Visa and Mastercard with either Static Data Authentication (SDA) or Dynamic Data Authentication (DDA) offline, our Tamarin analysis uncovers a trace that violates the property that the bank accepts all terminal-accepted transactions (Table II, Remarks). This issue is particularly relevant for offline transactions, where the lack of proper authentication can lead to fraudulent activities.

### Conclusion
Our analysis highlights critical security flaws in the Visa contactless protocol, particularly in the Visa EMV High and Visa DDA Low configurations. These flaws can be exploited to bypass PIN verification and perform fraudulent transactions. We have demonstrated a practical attack and suggested potential fixes. In contrast, Mastercard transactions using CDA are secure. Further research and industry action are needed to address these vulnerabilities and ensure the security of contactless payments.
