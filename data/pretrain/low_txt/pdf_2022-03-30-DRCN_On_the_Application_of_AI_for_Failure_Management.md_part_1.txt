## Overview

### Keynote: On the Application of AI for Failure Management: Problems, Solutions, and Algorithms

**Abstract:**
Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) is a class of software that aims to automate operational tasks through machine learning (ML) technologies. ML algorithms are typically used to support tasks such as anomaly detection, root cause analysis, failure prevention, failure prediction, and system remediation. AIOps is gaining increasing interest from the industry due to the exponential growth of IT operations and the complexity of new technologies. Modern applications are assembled from hundreds of dependent microservices distributed across many cloud platforms, leading to extremely complex software systems. Studies show that cloud environments are now too complex to be managed solely by humans.

This talk will discuss various AIOps problems we have addressed over the years and provide an overview of the solutions and algorithms we have implemented. Interesting problems include hypervisor anomaly detection, root cause analysis of software service failures using application logs, multi-modal anomaly detection, root cause analysis using distributed traces, and verification of virtual private cloud networks.
