In HTML, the `writing-mode` property is used to define the direction of text. Here are some possible values for this property:

### Keyword Values
- `writing-mode: horizontal-tb;` - Text flows horizontally from left to right, with new lines added below.
- `writing-mode: vertical-rl;` - Text flows vertically from top to bottom, with new lines added to the left.
- `writing-mode: vertical-lr;` - Text flows vertically from top to bottom, with new lines added to the right.

### Global Values
- `writing-mode: inherit;` - The element inherits the `writing-mode` value from its parent.
- `writing-mode: initial;` - The element's `writing-mode` is set to its default value.
- `writing-mode: unset;` - The element's `writing-mode` is set to its inherited or default value, depending on the context.

Here are two images that demonstrate the use of `writing-mode` in HTML:

Does Flutter support similar functionality for controlling text direction?
