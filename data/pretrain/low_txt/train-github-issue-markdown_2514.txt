### How to Reproduce the Bug

1. **Create a Dashboard with the Following Structure:**
   - **Tabs and Charts:**
     - Three charts, each placed in one of three separate tabs.
   - **Dashboard Filters:**
     - Each tab has its own dedicated filter:
       - Filter 1 is scoped to Tab 1.
       - Filter 2 is scoped to Tab 2.
       - Filter 3 is scoped to Tab 3.
   - **Save or Upload:**
     - Save the dashboard with the name "bug_report_20221220".
     - Alternatively, upload the dashboard from the file `dashboard_export_20221220T112259.zip`.
     - **Note:** The dashboard uses the "birth_names" dataset from the Examples.

2. **Navigate to the Dashboard:**
   - Go to the "Dashboards" menu item in Superset.
   - Click on the dashboard named "bug_report_20221220".

3. **Observe the Behavior:**
   - You will notice that the charts in the tabs do not display until you unfold the out-of-scope filters.
   - **Note:** You may need to open the dashboard "bug_report_20221220" twice to consistently reproduce the unexpected behavior.

### Expected Results
- The charts in each tab should display without the need to unfold the out-of-scope filters.

### Actual Results
- The charts in each tab do not display until the out-of-scope filters are unfolded.
