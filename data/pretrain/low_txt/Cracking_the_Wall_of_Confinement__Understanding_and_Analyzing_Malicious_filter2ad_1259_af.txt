### Factors to Consider in Domain Release Decisions

When deciding whether to release a domain, several factors should be considered, especially for domains that have been sinkholed. Sinkhole operators must monitor the traffic to determine when malicious activity ceases. Rezaeirad et al. [56] have developed a traffic analyzer to study sinkholed traffic, which can help determine when a domain is no longer receiving malicious traffic. This procedure is particularly important for domains related to malware campaigns, such as Command and Control (C&C) domains.

For other types of malicious domains, such as those involved in carding or pharmaceutical scams, three key factors should be evaluated before releasing them:

1. **Popularity of the Malicious Domain**: Popular malicious domains are more likely to be re-registered if released prematurely compared to less popular ones.
2. **Current Traffic**: If the domain is still receiving traffic, it indicates that it might resume malicious activity if released and re-registered.
3. **Degree of Maliciousness**: Domains involved in serious criminal activities, such as child abuse, should not be released. These high-risk domains should be permanently taken down and reserved by registries to prevent future registration.

By considering these factors, domain holders can make informed decisions about the appropriate takedown duration.

### Limitations

It is important to note that the takedown lifecycle (i.e., sinkhole duration and active duration) is limited by the visibility of Passive DNS (PDNS). If a domain's Top-Level Domain (TLD) is not within the daily feed list of supported TLDs, the accuracy of the seized domain’s lifecycle becomes dependent on the resolution requests for the domain. In other words, the accuracy of the duration depends on whether resolution requests occurred and were captured by PDNS sensors.

Another limitation is that the algorithm in Section III-C might inaccurately label some domains due to the limited number of snapshots for each domain in our dataset. However, this issue affects less than 4% of the domains in our analysis, so its impact on the overall study is minimal.

### Related Work

#### Studies on Domain Takedowns

Previous research on domain takedowns has primarily focused on the effectiveness of takedown procedures, including the coverage of taken-down domains and the active duration of malicious domains. For example, Hutchings et al. [42] conducted user interviews to understand the expertise of different parties involved in domain takedowns, such as law enforcement and takedown services. Moore et al. [51] studied the speed of domain takedowns for various types of cybercrime, including phishing and child abuse. They concluded that domain takedowns alone cannot completely mitigate phishing. Nadji et al. [53] investigated the coverage of botnet takedowns and proposed a system to identify missed malicious domains during takedown operations. Asghari et al. [39] analyzed logs from Conficker sinkholes to measure the effectiveness of the sinkholing effort. Rezaeirad et al. [56] studied the victims of Remote Access Trojans (RATs) by sinkholing RAT servers. Kuhrer et al. [45] examined the effectiveness of malware blacklists by identifying sinkhole servers in the blacklist.

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to provide a fine-grained view of the domain takedown procedure, including sinkhole configuration and lifecycle, and to reveal multiple weaknesses in the process.

#### DNS Misconfiguration

Pappas et al. [54] revealed that DNS misconfigurations are widespread, degrading the reliability of DNS. Jiang et al. [43] found that malicious domains could remain resolvable due to outdated data in upper-level DNS. Liu et al. [48] discussed security threats related to dangling DNS records, such as domain hijacking. Vissers et al. [59] explored scenarios where domains could be hijacked through their nameservers. Borgolte et al. [40] demonstrated a scenario for temporary domain hijacking through stale A records provided by cloud services.

We investigated the DNS misconfiguration issues of sinkhole servers and their impact on the domain takedown procedure.

#### Domain Abuse

Numerous studies have examined abuse in the DNS ecosystem. Korczynski et al. [44] investigated abuse in new generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs). Visser et al. [60] studied malicious campaigns in the .eu TLD. Recent studies have also looked into domain re-registration patterns and their relation to domain abuse. Hao et al. [41] found that spammers commonly re-register expired domains. Lauinger et al. [46] discussed the variations in how registrars implement domain lifetimes. Moore et al. [52] found that failed bank websites have been re-registered and used for malicious purposes. Lever et al. [47] studied the malicious behavior of re-registered domains after they expired. Miramirkhani et al. [49] examined domain drop-catching services and found a tendency to reuse malicious domains. Our study, in contrast, focuses on the maliciousness of re-registered takedown domains and explores its root causes.

### Conclusion

This paper presents the first systematic study on domain takedowns, aiming to understand the process and investigate its security and reliability. By leveraging WHOIS information and PDNS data, we determined the takedown domains and profiled their lifecycles. Analyzing 625,692 takedown domains, our research provides new insights into takedown operations and highlights critical observations about sinkhole operators. This helps in identifying best practices to avoid loopholes in these services and enhance their effectiveness against cybercrime.
