# Browser Extension Systems and Security

## Introduction
In addition to the Firefox extension system analyzed in this paper, Firefox also features an experimental extension system called Jetpack [27]. Similar to the proposed extension system, Jetpack exposes browser functionality through narrow interfaces. Currently, each Jetpack extension runs with the user’s full privileges and has access to the complete Firefox extension API. As Jetpack matures, it is expected that the Firefox developers will restrict the privileges of Jetpack extensions. However, the designers of Jetpack have chosen to focus initially on usability and generativity [29].

Internet Explorer uses a combined plug-in and extension system known as Browser Helper Object (BHO) modules. For example, the Yahoo Toolbar for Internet Explorer is implemented as a BHO. These extensions are written in native code and have direct access to the win32 API. If a BHO has a vulnerability, such as a buffer overflow, a malicious website can exploit this vulnerability to issue arbitrary win32 API calls. Recent versions of Internet Explorer run these BHOs in "protected mode" [26], which reduces their privileges. However, a compromised BHO still has full access to web pages (including passwords and cookies) and read access to the file system.

## Privilege Limitation in Extensions
A recent study [25] considers limiting the privileges of Firefox extensions. The authors propose a mechanism for sandboxing extensions by intercepting various events in the XPCOM object marshaling layer, resulting in a 19% performance overhead for a specific policy. Unlike our work, this study focuses entirely on the mechanism without determining which policies the mechanism should enforce. We could use this mechanism to reduce the privileges of Firefox extensions at the escalation points identified in Section 3.2.

Several papers [15, 35, 7, 16, 31] address the problem of running native plug-in code securely using fault isolation and system call interposition. These techniques focus on isolating untrusted native code, whereas we focus on code written in JavaScript, allowing us to use the standard same-origin JavaScript sandbox. Our primary concern is the privileges afforded to extensions via explicit APIs, a topic that has not been extensively studied. The techniques for plug-in confinement are complementary to our work and could be used to monitor native binaries distributed with extensions.

Our work is also related to mashups, which are web pages that result from sophisticated communication and data sharing between multiple parties. In a sense, a browser is a mashup combining extension code and web content into a personalized browsing experience. Our design draws inspiration from MashupOS [32] and OMash [14], taking into account subsequent attacks and design recommendations [10]. The isolated worlds heap-segregation mechanism is an outgrowth of the perspective expressed in [12]. Finally, placing the extension’s public key in the URL was suggested in [21] to remedy a vulnerability in Firefox’s signed JAR mechanism.

## Performance Considerations
Separating extensions into components could add overhead to inter-component operations. For example, if a content script needs to use privileges held by the extension core, it must send a message to the core process instead of calling a function in its own address space. Similarly, DOM access from content scripts requires crossing from the extension’s isolated world to the page’s world, incurring an additional hash table lookup on some execution paths.

To evaluate the runtime overhead of inter-process communication, we measured the round-trip latency for sending a message from a content script to the extension core in Google Chrome 4.0.249.22 on Mac OS X. We observed an average round-trip latency of 0.8 ms (n = 100, σ = 0.0079 ms), where each trial is the average of 1000 inter-process round-trips. An extension incurs this added latency only for operations requiring coordination between multiple components. For example, an extension that adds EXIF metadata to Flickr [28] incurs this overhead once per page load to issue a cross-origin XMLHttpRequest, increasing the load time by an unnoticeable 0.8 ms.

To evaluate the runtime overhead of the isolated worlds mechanism, we ran a DOM core performance benchmark [20] in Chromium 4.0.266.0 on Mac OS X. The benchmark measures the total speed of a set of append, prepend, insert, index, and remove DOM operations. In the main world, the benchmark required an average of 231 ms (n = 100, σ = 5.46 ms) to complete. When run in an isolated world, the benchmark took an average of 309 ms (n = 100, σ = 6.33 ms). The use of isolated worlds adds 33.3% to DOM access time, which we expect would be a small fraction of overall run and load time.

## Conclusion
Browser extensions are often not written by security experts, and many contain security vulnerabilities. Every cross-site scripting vulnerability in a Firefox extension is a potential avenue for malicious websites to install malware onto the user’s machine because Firefox extensions run with the user’s full privileges. To evaluate whether extensions actually require such a high level of privilege, we analyzed 25 “recommended” extensions from the Firefox extension gallery. We found that the majority of these extensions do not require full privileges. However, reducing the privileges of existing Firefox extensions is difficult because many Firefox APIs are more powerful than required to implement extension features.

Although one could imagine restructuring the Firefox extension interface, we recommend building a new extension platform with security in mind. In our proposed system, extensions enumerate which privileges they desire at install-time and are limited to those privileges at runtime. If an extension does not include a native binary (which most do not require), then an attacker who compromises the extension will not gain the privilege to run arbitrary code.

In addition to least privilege, we separate privileges by dividing extensions into three components: content scripts, the extension core, and a native binary. Content scripts are exposed directly to web content but have few privileges. Native binaries are powerful but (by default) have no direct contact with web content. The three components interact via narrow interfaces, reducing the attack surface for the privileged components. We expect vulnerabilities to exist, but we hope they will be harder to exploit than a single cross-site scripting hole.
