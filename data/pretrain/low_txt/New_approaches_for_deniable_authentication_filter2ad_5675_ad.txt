### Key Generation and Public Information

1. **Key Computation**: The values \( c \) and \( d \) are computed.
2. **Hash Function Selection**: A hash function \( H \) is chosen from the family of Universal One-Way Hash Functions (UOWHFs). Additionally, a universal hash function \( H \) is selected such that \( H: G_q \rightarrow \{0, 1\}^{2k} \).
3. **Public and Secret Keys**: The public key for party \( P_i \) is \( PK_i = (c, d, H, H) \), and the secret key is \( SK_i = (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) \).

The public information consists of:
\[ I_0 = (p, q, g_1, g_2, PK_1, \ldots, PK_n) \]

The private information for party \( P_i \) is:
\[ I_i = SK_i \]

### Protocol Execution

When party \( P_i \) is activated and receives an external request to send a message \( m \) to party \( P_j \), the protocol \( \lambda_{DDH} \) invokes a two-party sub-protocol \( \hat{\lambda}_{DDH} \) between \( P_i \) and \( P_j \). For simplicity, we use the names \( A \) and \( B \) instead of \( P_i \) and \( P_j \).

#### Detailed Steps:

1. **Message Transmission**:
   - \( A \) sends the message \( m \) to \( B \) (and outputs "A sent message \( m \) to B").
   - Upon receiving \( m \) from \( A \), \( B \) creates a challenge for \( A \):
     - A random \( r \in \mathbb{Z}_q \) is chosen.
     - The following values are computed:
       \[
       u_1 = g_1^r, \quad u_2 = g_2^r, \quad \alpha = H(m, B), \quad v = c^r d^r \alpha, \quad h_1 = H(v)
       \]
   - \( B \) sends the challenge \( (u_1, u_2, h_1) \) to \( A \).

2. **Challenge Verification**:
   - \( A \) verifies the challenge by computing:
     \[
     \alpha = H(m, B), \quad v = u_1^{x_1 + \alpha y_1} u_2^{x_2 + \alpha y_2}
     \]
     and checks if \( h_1 = H(v) \).
   - If the challenge is valid, \( A \) computes:
     \[
     h_2 = H'(v)
     \]
     and sends the reply \( (m, h_2) \) to \( B \).

3. **Reply Verification**:
   - When \( B \) receives the reply \( (m, h_2) \) from \( A \):
     - \( B \) checks if \( h_2 = H'(v) \) using its copy of \( v \).
     - If the check passes, \( B \) accepts \( m \) and outputs "B received \( m \) from A".
     - Otherwise, \( B \) rejects the message and terminates the invocation of \( \hat{\lambda}_{DDH} \).

### Security Analysis

**Theorem 5**: Assume the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption holds on the group \( G_q \). Then, the protocol \( \lambda_{DDH} \) is a secure message authenticator.

### Deniability for \( \lambda_{DDH} \)

**Deniable Authentication**:
- If the receiver is honest, the protocol \( \lambda_{DDH} \) can be proven to be a deniable authenticator. A simulator can be defined by choosing a random \( r \in \mathbb{Z}_q \) and computing the appropriate values as an honest receiver would.
- For a dishonest receiver, the situation is more complex. A black-box simulation of the receiver fails because the dishonest simulator cannot simulate the response \( h_2 \) after sending the challenge \( (u_1, u_2, h_1) \).

To address this, a challenge-response mechanism is introduced where \( A \) commits to the answer \( h_2 \) and reveals it only after \( B \) shows that he knows \( h_2 \) as well. This makes it redundant to split \( H(v) \) into two pieces, and \( v \) alone can be used.

**Protocol Den-λDDH**:
- \( A \)'s public key includes an unconditionally binding commitment scheme \( COM \) (i.e., a commitment scheme that can be opened in only one way even with infinite computing power, but its secrecy is computational).

**Theorem 6**: Protocol Den-λDDH is a forward deniable authenticator if used sequentially.

**Remarks**:
- The first step is malleable, showing how far we have moved from the CCA paradigm. We can think of \( u_1, u_2 \) as the "encryption" of a key, and \( v \) as the MAC of the message. However, proving the encryption step to be CCA-secure is challenging.
- In concurrent executions, the unforgeability property holds. Using timing assumptions to limit the number of open executions to a logarithmic number, we achieve deniability in the concurrent setting.
