**Title: Message from the Dependable Computing and Communications Symposium (DCCS) Program Chair**

Welcome to Japan and to DSN 2005. This year's DCCS program features 55 exceptional papers that address a broad spectrum of dependability issues, highlighting the depth and breadth of our community's research efforts. The high quality of these papers is a result of a rigorous selection process, in keeping with the long-standing tradition of this conference and its predecessor, FTCS.

This year, we received 205 complete submissions out of an initial 261, a significant number that underscores the importance of dependable computing and the vitality and creativity of our community. These submissions included contributions from industry, as well as collaborative efforts between academia and industry, alongside the usual submissions from universities and national research labs. Notably, there was a continued trend of cross-organizational and international collaborations, with submissions from over 35 countries across all continents.

The review process adhered to the high standards expected of this conference. In early December, program committee members suggested external reviewers for the papers. The rate of completed reviews by external referees exceeded 70 percent, resulting in a total of 846 completed reviews for the 205 submissions. These reviews were discussed at a program committee meeting in Pisa on February 21 and 22, 2005, attended by more than 40 PC members. Each regular paper was reviewed by 2 program committee members and up to 3 external reviewers, while practical experience reports and software demonstrations were each reviewed by 3 program committee members and 2 external reviewers, yielding an average of 4.13 reviews per paper. Managing such a large number of submissions was particularly challenging, and the generation of these 846 reviews was made possible by the generous efforts of many individuals.

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks and deep appreciation to the 47 program committee members, none of whom missed a single review, and to the 470 external reviewers who volunteered their time and expertise to produce these reviews.

Many individuals have provided invaluable assistance throughout the lengthy preparation leading to this program. I am grateful to Paulo Veríssimo, Jean Arlat, and Mootaz Elnozahy for their excellent advice, support, and mentoring. I am also deeply indebted to Silvano Chiaradonna, whose indispensable help with setting up, operating, and maintaining the START tool used for program management played a crucial role in the smooth processing and coordination of the work that resulted in the DCCS technical program.

Special thanks go to Lorenzo Falai and Ettore Ricciardi for their help in organizing the program committee meeting and other logistical functions. Finally, I would like to thank ISTI-CNR for hosting the symposium’s website and the University of Firenze for supporting the program committee meeting and providing partial sponsorship of the program.

I hope you will find the program both rewarding and inspiring. Enjoy it, and enjoy your time in Yokohama!
