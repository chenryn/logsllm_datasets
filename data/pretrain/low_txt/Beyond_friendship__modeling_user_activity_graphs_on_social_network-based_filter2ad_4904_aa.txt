## Abstract
We analyze user activity data from three popular gifting applications on Facebook to study the evolution of user activity through the most commonly used growth mechanism, Application Requests (ARs). Our findings indicate that user activity graphs (UAGs) differ significantly from friendship graphs due to the inherent directionality of user activity and node transience. Unlike degree distributions in friendship graphs, UAGs exhibit strong asymmetry in in- and out-degree distributions, with out-degrees not fitting known parametric distributions. Consequently, existing intent- and feature-driven algorithms for modeling friendship graphs are inadequate for simulating UAGs.

We introduce a novel probabilistic growth model for user activity in gifting applications. This model decouples in- and out-degrees based on their distinct characteristics observed in empirical data. Our model generates synthetic graphs with disconnected components and low node clustering, closely matching the structure of real UAGs. We discuss the benefits and limitations of our model and its applicability to other types of Online Social Network (OSN)-based applications, such as social games. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore and model user activity growth processes in OSN-based applications.

## 1. Introduction
Over the past five years, Facebook has become the most widely used Online Social Network (OSN) with over 950 million users. Through its Developer Platform, Facebook supports a rich ecosystem of social applications, which has grown into a $6+ billion industry as of 2012. This growing importance of OSNs has spurred significant academic interest, with much research focusing on studying friendship graphs. However, less is known about user activity on social networks, despite arguments for its greater importance over simple friendship formation. This lack of research is largely due to privacy concerns and the limited availability of user activity data.

User activity graphs (UAGs) differ significantly from friendship graphs. While friendship graphs consist of static, reciprocal relationships, UAGs are dynamic and may be non-reciprocal. Furthermore, user activity on OSNs is not always based on the underlying friendship graph and exhibits temporal variance in graph properties. These differences render existing models for friendship graphs inapplicable to UAGs.

Several questions regarding UAGs from social applications remain unanswered, including whether it is possible to model UAGs. Our goal is to explore the possibility of modeling UAGs from all social applications on Facebook, focusing on gifting applications. These applications utilize one or more of the four available growth mechanisms on Facebook: Application Requests (ARs), Newsfeed Stories, Emails, and Paid Advertising. Among these, only ARs are used by all Facebook applications. This paper focuses on understanding the growth of UAGs through ARs by studying and modeling UAGs from gifting applications, which enable inter-user sharing of virtual gifts via ARs.

Our survey of the top 250 Facebook applications shows that gifting is the second-most popular genre behind gaming, and all gaming applications use gifting as a feature to increase growth. Since gifting applications use only ARs, their UAGs are simpler to model. We use static snapshots of empirical UAGs from three popular gifting applications on Facebook to study the growth of UAGs. This approach enables us to address the following questions:

1. **How do UAGs from social applications differ from friendship graphs obtained from OSNs?**
   - Unlike the creation and deletion of friendships, UAGs exhibit year-round dynamic patterns, with high user activity during special occasions and holidays. User activity is not always reciprocal, leading to distinct in- and out-degree distributions. Additionally, there is an explicit cost associated with initiating activities, further distinguishing in- and out-degrees.

2. **Do existing graph models suffice when modeling user activity from social gifting applications?**
   - We evaluate intent- and feature-driven algorithms, such as Nearest Neighbor and Forest Fire, and find that they are too simplistic to generate gifting UAGs. Out-degree distributions in UAGs cannot be explained by power-laws or any known parametric distribution, unlike OSN friendship graphs.

3. **What key features should be considered to model UAGs from gifting applications? How do these features change over time?**
   - We explore metrics such as clustering coefficients, degree distributions, and connected component sizes, along with user behavior metrics like likelihoods of interacting with inactive users and targeting new users, and distributions of user lifetimes and daily interactions. Our analysis shows that degree distributions and connected component size distributions stabilize over approximately one week, while clustering coefficients and the number of connected components vary.

4. **Is it possible to model user activity on a class of social applications that utilize the same underlying growth mechanism?**
   - We provide an algorithm tailored to gifting applications using ARs. Unlike existing friendship models, our algorithm decouples in- and out-degrees and uses application-specific metrics as inputs to generate accurate synthetic graphs. We show the efficacy of our algorithm in generating weekly synthetic graphs for gifting applications and provide a mathematical formula describing the expected distribution in activity levels among users.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to model UAGs from OSN-based applications. Our model can be applied to other Facebook gifting applications and can forecast usage, providing an alternative to sharing large datasets that may violate user privacy.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 presents our methodology and rationale, Section 4 analyzes measurements for selected graph metrics, Section 5 introduces our UAG growth model and discusses its potential uses, and Section 6 concludes the paper and outlines future work.

## 2. Related Work
The increasing relevance of OSNs to online user activity has led to a surge in analyses of OSNs. Some researchers have focused on usage patterns, while others have studied graph-theoretic properties. Research into OSN network growth has resulted in multiple algorithms that produce synthetic graphs to mimic OSN friendship graph properties, drawing concepts from earlier graph theory, including algorithms for offline social network growth such as Nearest Neighbor, Random Walk, and Barabasi-Albert. Some research combines preferential attachment with latent node characteristics to study OSN network growth.

Time-varying OSN graphs have also been studied. Gummadi et al. report on the strength of user interactions on Facebook using indigenous OSN applications, finding that communication decreases over time due to relationship fatigue. Leskovec et al. propose the Forest Fire algorithm to model OSN network growth, noting that graphs over time do not follow the same patterns as initially formed. Other research has focused on information dissemination patterns on OSNs, suggesting that statistical methods alone cannot fully explain network topology. Holme et al. propose studying static snapshots of graphs to understand the evolution of temporal networks.

The lack of real data sets from OSNs has hindered research into growth patterns, especially for social applications. High-level statistical analyses exist, but the growth processes have not been studied. Our social applications provide a unique opportunity to study the growth of OSN-based applications. We believe that user fatigue, as observed by Gummadi et al., also applies to social applications, where novelty explains early growth and fatigue accounts for decline. We find that growing and aged graphs exhibit different patterns, and this paper is the first to study and model the growth of user activity on social applications.

## 3. Methodology and Rationale
Our end-goal is to study the growth processes of all OSN-based applications. Due to limited access to OSN application data, we focus on applications on Facebook, the largest OSN.

### 3.1 Growth Mechanisms of OSN Applications
Facebook applications allow subscribed users to interact with non-subscribing users to encourage application growth. A subscribing user is someone who has "logged in" to the application through an installation screen. Online social applications belong to different genres, with some targeting high engagement (games) and others targeting casual users (gifting).

Application statistics websites rank Facebook applications by Monthly Active Users (MAU). Our review in January 2012 showed that 74.4% of the top 250 Facebook applications by MAU were Flash or text-based gaming applications, while 9.43% were gifting applications. Gaming and gifting applications are the two largest sets of Facebook applications.

We study growth processes for social applications using the OSN-based application architecture, which depends on the growth mechanisms employed. Facebook provides the following growth mechanisms:

- **Application Requests (ARs):** Subscribing users can send ARs to friends, allowing them to recruit friends to applications free of cost. Facebook limits the number of outgoing requests per user, typically 20 per day, but up to 60. There are no limits on the number of ARs a user may receive.
- **Newsfeed Stories:** Personalized posts on a user's profile made through applications. Facebook controls the visibility of these stories. Newsfeed stories are less reliable for application growth compared to ARs.
- **Emails:** Applications can send email notifications to personal email addresses, pending user approval. Developers rarely use this channel due to security concerns.
- **Paid Advertising:** Application developers can purchase advertisements to boost subscription growth.

All applications use ARs. Our data allows us to study the growth process arising from the use of ARs through UAGs from Facebook-based gifting applications. We define a gifting application as one that uses only ARs for growth and inter-user communication and allows users to share themed images (gifts) through ARs with their Facebook friends.

### 3.2 Measuring Gifting Application UAGs
We use UAGs from three Facebook gifting applications to study application growth through the AR growth mechanism. Each node in the UAG represents a Facebook user, and each directed edge from User A to User B represents an AR sent from User A to User B. Our UAGs are multigraphs, meaning User A may have multiple directed edges to User B. The UAGs were obtained through server-side measurements of the following Facebook-based gifting applications, owned and operated by Manakki, LLC:

- **iHeart:** Launched in June 2009, iHeart grew to 30 million monthly active users by December 2009 and was installed by 76 million users by August 2010. Our user activity traces capture 2.2 billion activities. Users share decorative heart-shaped graphics with their Facebook friends.
- **iSmile:** Launched in August 2008, iSmile was installed by 43 million users by August 2010. Our user activity traces for iSmile capture 1.5 billion user activities. Users share graphics of smiling characters with their Facebook friends.
- **Hugged:** Launched in February 2008, Hugged was installed by 28 million users by August 2010. Our user activity traces for Hugged capture 1.6 billion user activities. Users share graphics of hugging characters with their Facebook friends.

iHeart was a very popular application that ranked in the top 10 most popular applications on Facebook at its peak.
