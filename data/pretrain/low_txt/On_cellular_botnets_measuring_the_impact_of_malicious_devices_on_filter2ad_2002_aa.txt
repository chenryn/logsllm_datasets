## Abstract
The increasing interconnectivity with the Internet and the rapid evolution of highly capable but largely insecure mobile devices pose significant threats to cellular networks. This paper characterizes the impact of large-scale compromise and coordination of mobile phones in attacks against the core of these networks. Through a combination of measurement, simulation, and analysis, we demonstrate that a botnet composed of as few as 11,750 compromised mobile phones can degrade service to area-code-sized regions by 93%. These attacks are executed through network service requests rather than a constant stream of phone calls, making them difficult for users to detect. We also investigate significant network bottlenecks, their impact on the density of compromised nodes per base station, and potential countermeasures to mitigate such threats.

## 1. Introduction
Attacks on the core infrastructure of the Internet have become commonplace, with services like DNS and BGP regularly targeted by sophisticated adversaries. While these attacks have caused significant problems for specific services and domains, they have not yet resulted in an Internet-wide collapse. However, cellular networks, which have more rigid hierarchical dependencies, are less likely to withstand similar malicious activities. Academic research in this area has primarily focused on two areas: the lack of authentication for signaling traffic in wired networks and attacks targeting the wireless portion of the network. However, there has been no investigation into whether compromised mobile phones can generate sufficient traffic to impair the network core itself.

In this paper, we evaluate the potential and impact of large-scale infection and coordination of mobile phones in attacks against the core of a cellular network. Specifically, we characterize Denial of Service (DoS) attacks using selected service request types on the Home Location Register (HLR), the central repository of user location and profile information in the network. Our results show that botnets as small as 11,750 phones can cause a reduction of throughput by more than 90% to area-code-sized regions supported by most currently deployed systems. More capable databases experience a throughput reduction of approximately 75% when faced with attacks by 141,000 compromised devices. We then explore the bottlenecks that make the realization of these attacks difficult and how they can be overcome.

## 2. Related Work
Denial of service attacks have been studied in various systems, including DNS roots, software vendors, news services, search engines, and online casinos. Such attacks have even impacted physical-world resources and processes, causing significant outages in banking, emergency, and postal services. The research community has responded with significant efforts to categorize and mitigate these problems. However, such attacks are only beginning to be understood in the context of cellular networks.

Previous research on the malicious overload of cellular networks has focused on the wireless domain. Traynor et al. demonstrated that a small volume of text messages targeted at a geographic area could deny legitimate voice and SMS service. Serror et al. and Lee et al. showed similar results by overloading paging services and shared uplink channels, respectively. Racic et al. investigated problems with resource allocation algorithms on the air interface. While it is possible to mitigate the impact of such attacks using queue and resource management techniques, Traynor et al. noted that the architecture of the network itself enables such attacks.

The transformation of mobile devices from simple voice terminals into highly capable, general-purpose computing platforms makes the possibility of attacks originating from within the network a reality. Mudge and Kingpin were among the first to discuss the insecurity of early handheld devices. Since then, others have further investigated vulnerable device interfaces, including Bluetooth and the multimedia messaging subsystem (MMS). While malware targeting such devices has surfaced, widespread infection like that seen on the Internet has yet to be reported. Given the lack of sufficient protection mechanisms, the ability of these devices to impact larger network functionality must be investigated.

## 3. Overview of Cellular Systems
### 3.1 Network Architecture and Components
The heart of a cellular network is the Home Location Register (HLR). Users are assigned to specific HLRs based on their phone numbers. When someone attempts to call a user, the caller’s switch queries the appropriate HLR with a request for the targeted user’s current location. A variety of other services, ranging from authentication and call-forwarding to billing, rely on assistance from the HLR. This central repository of user profile data is crucial for providing service in a network with mobile endpoints.

Mobile Switching Centers (MSCs) act as telephony switches and deliver circuit-switched traffic in a GSM network. MSCs perform handoffs between base stations, assist in billing operations, and can function as gateways to both wired and neighboring cellular systems. With the assistance of a Visiting Location Register (VLR), MSCs can identify and store information about currently associated subscribers. However, requests for other subscribers still require interaction with the HLR. For data connections, these operations are performed by the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN).

Mobile phones and other cellular-enabled devices connect wirelessly to the network through the Base Station Subsystem (BSS). These units provide the logic for operations such as wireless resource management, encryption, and frequency hopping.

### 3.2 Mobile Phone Architecture
Mobile phones operate using two processors: the Application Processor and the Baseband Processor. The Application Processor supports traditional operating system duties and user services such as the camera and music players. When a process needs to use the network, the Application Processor passes an AT command to the Baseband Processor. These commands can be used to establish telephony and data links or invoke network-supported services such as call waiting and registration.

AT commands can be passed to the Baseband Processor in various ways, including Bluetooth connections, serial links, and other applications with the necessary privileges. Malware infecting such devices can easily initiate interaction with the network core.

### 3.3 Infecting Phones
Mobile devices have rapidly transformed from limited embedded systems to highly capable general-purpose computing platforms. While such devices have long enjoyed significant diversity in hardware and operating systems, the rising popularity of smartphones and the ability to sell applications to users is leading to the establishment of standardized mobile software platforms and operating systems, such as Microsoft’s Windows Mobile and Google’s Android.
