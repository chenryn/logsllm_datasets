**User:** Does anyone know how to set the default save path or directory for Python scripts before running them? On my Mac, the system defaults to saving these files in the top-level `~/Documents` directory. I would like to specify a different, more convenient location. Any suggestions?

**Assistant:** On Windows (at least on Vista, which is what I am currently using), you can set the "Start in" field for shortcut icons on the desktop. This field allows you to specify the directory that will be used as the current working directory when the program starts. Adjusting this setting works for me. Is there a similar feature available on macOS? (Alternatively, starting the script from the command line in the desired directory also works.)
