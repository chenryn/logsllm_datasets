### Genomic Architecture of Blood Metabolites

To elucidate the genomic architecture of blood metabolites, we estimated total heritability (h²_total), SNP heritability (h²_SNP), and the proportion of heritability captured by known metabolite loci (h²_GW-loci). We reviewed all association studies of SNPs and blood metabolites, retrieving 241,965 associations. All associated metabolites were classified. For the estimation of h²_GW-loci, we aggregated over 800 class-specific metabolite loci for 309 lipids and 52 organic acids. This analysis revealed significant differences in h²_SNP and h²_GW-loci among different classes of lipids and organic acids. Phosphatidylcholines with a higher degree of unsaturation had higher h²_GW-loci estimates.

This study highlights the genetic architecture of metabolite classes and lipid species, with genes explaining, on average, 50% of the variation in metabolites, and common genetic variants influencing these traits. This knowledge can be used in the construction of polygenic scores and causal modeling.

### The Future for Food May Be in Our Past: The Importance of Plants in Our Diets

**Presenting Author: Cathie Martin, John Innes Centre, Colney Research Park, UK**

The appreciation of the challenges of achieving global food security has evolved to include nutritional security. Scientists have recognized that not only calorie content but also the composition of food and the gut microbiota impact our health and well-being. The ways in which the nutrients we consume affect our health are highly complex due to the diversity of what we eat, the varying digestibility of foods, the changing composition and functioning of each individual’s gut microbiota, differences in nutrient absorption and bioavailability, and the multifaceted mechanisms of action that nutrients have on our health.

For over 50 years, it has been accepted that diets rich in plants, particularly fruits and vegetables, protect health. However, dietary trends have shifted, with lower fruit and vegetable consumption being replaced by more cheap, sugary, and processed foods. These changes have significantly impacted the incidence of chronic diseases such as obesity, metabolic disorders, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.

Understanding how phytonutrients improve our health by reducing the risk of chronic diseases and identifying which phytonutrients confer the greatest benefits (a process termed comparative nutrition) is crucial for achieving dietary improvements at all levels of society. By describing examples of preclinical comparative nutritional analyses, I aim to illustrate the potential of dietary improvement using plant-based foods to enhance our health and quality of life and reduce the economic burden on healthcare systems.

### Comprehensive Investigations of Cancer Cell Metabolism Using 13C-Fluxomics

**Presenting Author: Jean-Charles Portais, University Toulouse, France**

Metabolism is a fundamental cellular function that sustains survival, growth, and adaptation in living organisms. At the cellular level, metabolism is organized as a network of biochemical reactions that are tightly interconnected. To investigate such complex systems, powerful tools are required. Over the past decade, a broad range of approaches, including metabolomics and fluxomics, have been developed to provide detailed and quantitative measurements of the operation of metabolic networks. These methods can be combined with other omics tools (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics) and metabolic modeling to provide a systems biology approach for a comprehensive understanding of the organization, functioning, and adaptation of cellular metabolism.

This understanding can provide the rationale for efficient and cost-effective optimization of production systems in biotechnology, characterize metabolic dysfunctions associated with pathologies, and identify and validate new therapeutic targets or strategies. In this lecture, particular emphasis will be placed on 13C-fluxomics, with selected illustrations in the field of cancer metabolism, and how this can help in designing improved therapeutic strategies.

While metabolomics has become a mature and widely used technology in academic research, its application to regulatory science has been limited. Several factors contribute to this slow uptake, with the most commonly cited roadblocks being the lack of standardization, validation, and reporting formats.
