## Chapter 1: Web Technologies Overview

### Introduction

Before setting up your web services and sites, it is important to become familiar with the key components of web technologies. Mac OS X Server offers an integrated Internet server solution, making it easy to set up and manage multiple websites and configure and monitor your web server. This guide is designed to help both novice and experienced web administrators.

### Key Web Components

#### Apache Web Server
- **Overview**: The web technologies in Mac OS X Server are based on Apache, an open-source HTTP web server.
- **Function**: A web server responds to requests for HTML webpages stored on your site.
- **Advantages**: Open-source software allows anyone to view and modify the source code, leading to widespread use and making Apache the most popular web server on the Internet today.

#### WebDAV
- **Overview**: WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is supported by Mac OS X Server.
- **Function**: Client users can check out webpages, make changes, and check them back in while the site is running.
- **Benefits**: The WebDAV command set is rich enough that client computers with Mac OS X installed can use a WebDAV-enabled web server as if it were a file server.

#### CGI Support
- **Overview**: Common Gateway Interface (CGI) support is included.
- **Function**: Allows the execution of scripts to generate dynamic content.

#### SSL Support
- **Overview**: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) support is provided.
- **Function**: Enables secure transactions over the web.

#### Dynamic Content with Server-Side Includes (SSI)
- **Overview**: Server-Side Includes (SSI) are supported.
- **Function**: Allows the inclusion of dynamic content within static HTML pages.
