### 3. IT Security
- **Topic:** Microsoft SDL (Security Development Lifecycle)
  - **Overview:** The SDL is a software development process that helps developers build more secure software while addressing security compliance requirements and reducing development costs.
  - **Resource:** [Microsoft SDL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/SDL)

#### SDL Practices
1. **Training:**
   - **Core Security Training:** A foundational practice that includes secure design, threat modeling, secure coding, security testing, and privacy best practices.

2. **Requirements:**
   - **Establish Security and Privacy Requirements:** Define and integrate security and privacy requirements early to minimize disruptions.
   - **Create Quality Gates/Bug Bars:** Define minimum acceptable levels of security and privacy quality.
   - **Perform Security and Privacy Risk Assessments:** Examine software design based on costs and regulatory requirements.

3. **Design:**
   - **Establish Design Requirements:** Consider security and privacy concerns early to minimize risks.
   - **Attack Surface Analysis/Reduction:** Reduce attack surfaces by analyzing and restricting access to system services.
   - **Use Threat Modeling:** Apply a structured approach to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.

4. **Implementation:**
   - **Use Approved Tools:** Publish a list of approved tools and security checks.
   - **Deprecate Unsafe Functions:** Ban unsafe functions and replace them with safer alternatives.
   - **Perform Static Analysis:** Analyze source code to ensure secure coding policies are followed.

5. **Verification:**
   - **Perform Dynamic Analysis:** Verify software functionality using tools that monitor application behavior.
   - **Fuzz Testing:** Induce program failure by introducing malformed or random data.
   - **Attack Surface Review:** Review attack surface measurements to ensure new attack vectors are mitigated.

6. **Release:**
   - **Create an Incident Response Plan:** Prepare for new threats that may emerge over time.
   - **Conduct Final Security Review:** Ensure all security activities are reviewed before release.
   - **Certify Release and Archive:** Certify software and archive pertinent data for post-release servicing.

7. **Response:**
   - **Execute Incident Response Plan:** Implement the plan to protect customers from emerging security or privacy vulnerabilities.

### 4. Conclusions
- **Reducing Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Reducing Costs:**
  - **Sysinternals Suite:**
    - Not about Sysinternals, but these are awesome tools.
