Auto-completion in `.tsx` files is not functioning as expected after the `<` token. Here are two specific examples to illustrate the issue:

1. **Primitive Type Autocompletion:**
   - **Expected Behavior:** When typing `<`, I would like to see `boolean` in the auto-completion list.
   - **Actual Behavior:** Only functions are shown, and `Boolean` (with a capital B) is the only option available.
   - **Screenshot:**

2. **React Element Autocompletion:**
   - **Expected Behavior:** When typing `<`, I would like to see imported React components in the auto-completion list.
   - **Actual Behavior:**
     - Intrinsic types like `div` work correctly.
     - Components defined in the current module are also properly autocompleted.
     - However, components that are imported from other modules are not shown in the list.
   - **Screenshot:**

Despite these issues, thank you for the improvements in version 1.8; it is much better overall!
