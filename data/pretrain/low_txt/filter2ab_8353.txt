**ATT&CK ID:** T1556.008  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Network Provider DLL

Adversaries may register malicious network provider dynamic link libraries (DLLs) to intercept and capture cleartext user credentials during the authentication process. Network provider DLLs are used by Windows to interface with specific network protocols and can also support additional credential management functions. During the logon process, the interactive logon module, Winlogon, sends credentials to the local `mpnotify.exe` process via Remote Procedure Call (RPC). The `mpnotify.exe` process then shares these credentials in cleartext with any registered credential managers, notifying them of the ongoing logon event. This mechanism can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
