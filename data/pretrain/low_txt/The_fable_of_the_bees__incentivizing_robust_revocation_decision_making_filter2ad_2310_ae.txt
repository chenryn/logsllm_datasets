### 5. Analysis of Node Revocation Probability

To provide nodes with an incentive to revoke a suspicious node, more than 50% of the maximum available evidence is required. This requirement can be attributed to the fact that the linear Intrusion Detection System (IDS) surpasses a detection probability of 50%, thereby setting a threshold for a positive expected benefit. As the evidence accumulates to 100%, the probability that a malicious node will be revoked approaches 1, even if only two nodes (N = 2) are competing to revoke it. Increasing the number of honest nodes enhances the likelihood of early revocation. For instance, with N = 10, 70% of the evidence is sufficient to revoke the malicious node with a probability close to 1, as illustrated in Figure 11(a).

In the case of our asymptotic IDS (Figure 11(b)), the number of competitors similarly influences the speed of revocation. However, nodes tend to revoke earlier because the IDS exceeds a detection probability of 50% at approximately round r = 27. With 10 competitors, 35% of the evidence is sufficient to achieve a revocation probability close to 1. Conversely, 60% of the evidence is needed for N = 5, and for N = 2, the probability does not exceed 95%. These findings align with the results from Figure 10(b), which indicate a lower risk appetite for a smaller number of competitors.

Our analysis demonstrates that the agility of both IDSs significantly depends on the number of honest nodes competing to revoke a malicious node. Even with a minimum of 2 honest nodes, the malicious node is revoked with high probability once sufficient evidence is collected. These results confirm that our karmic-suicide revocation scheme functions effectively in a network environment characterized by imperfect intrusion detection systems and judgment mechanisms.

\[
P(\text{revocation}) = 1 - \left(1 - F\left(b^{-1}\left(2 - 2 \cdot (1 - e_n(r))\right)\right)\right)^N
\]

### 7. Conclusion

Figure 11 illustrates the probability of revoking a malicious node after a certain number of rounds, r. In our karmic-suicide game, we limited the maximum available evidence to 100. For the linear IDS (Figure 11(a)), a bit more than 50% of the evidence is required to incentivize nodes to revoke a suspicious node. In contrast to the laissez-faire approach to revocation management suggested in current ad hoc networking literature, our work shows how the introduction of a Trusted Authority (TA) can aid the key revocation process and encourage more optimal revocation decisions by honest nodes.

We designed a new incentive mechanism called karmic-suicide, which encourages rational nodes to sacrifice short-term personal utility for long-term gains. We examined the inter- and intra-dependencies between TA-level judgment mechanisms and node-level revocation mechanisms to facilitate near-optimal revocation decision-making. Our game-theoretic analysis revealed that high error rates in a node's ability to accurately identify malicious nodes can be offset by higher network densities, leading to rapid revocation of malicious nodes.

Our findings align with various experimental economic studies, which have shown that the judicious application of punishment and rewards can efficiently incentivize desirable behavior when there is contention for a public resource [26, 2].

### Appendix A

**Proof of Equation 8.** The probability that a single node revokes the malicious node after the risk falls below a value \(1 - E\) is the probability that their respective risk acceptance value is less than or equal to \(1 - E\). The risk appetite value to take a risk \(1 - E\) can be calculated by the inverse of the equilibrium, i.e., by \(b^{-1}(1 - E)\). The probability that a node chooses this risk appetite value is \(F(b^{-1}(1 - E))\) (by the definition of \(F\)). Consequently, the probability that a single node revokes the suspect malicious node is:

\[
F(b^{-1}(1 - (2 \cdot (1 - e_n(r)) - 1))) = F(b^{-1}(2 - 2 \cdot (1 - e_n(r))))
\]

Finally, the probability that at least one of \(N\) competing nodes revokes the malicious node after a certain number of rounds \(r\) is:

\[
1 - \left(1 - F\left(b^{-1}\left(2 - 2 \cdot (1 - e_n(r))\right)\right)\right)^N
\]

**Proof of Requirements in Table 3.**

- **(A) ⇒ 2):**
  \[
  q_t > \frac{q_f}{b}
  \]
  \[
  b q_t - q_f > 0
  \]
  \[
  p_t > p_f
  \]
  \[
  p_t > b p_f \quad (b \leq 1)
  \]
  \[
  b p_f - p_t < 0
  \]

- **(B) ⇒ 1):**
  \[
  \frac{n}{n - 1} p_t > \frac{n + m}{n - 1}
  \]
  \[
  \Rightarrow b q_t - q_f > 0
  \]
  \[
  \Rightarrow p_t > p_f
  \]
  \[
  \Rightarrow p_t > b p_f \quad (b \leq 1)
  \]
  \[
  \Rightarrow b p_f - p_t < 0
  \]

- **(B) ⇒ 3):**
  \[
  \frac{n}{n - 1} p_t > \frac{n + m}{n - 1}
  \]
  \[
  \Rightarrow \frac{1 + \frac{m}{n}}{1 - \frac{1}{n}} p_t > \frac{n + m}{n - 1}
  \]
  \[
  \Rightarrow \frac{1 + \frac{m}{n}}{1 - \frac{1}{n}} p_t > \frac{n + m}{n - 1}
  \]
  \[
  \Rightarrow \frac{1 + \frac{m}{n}}{1 - \frac{1}{n}} p_t > \frac{n + m}{n - 1}
  \]
  \[
  \Rightarrow \frac{1 + \frac{m}{n}}{1 - \frac{1}{n}} p_t > \frac{n + m}{n - 1}
  \]
  \[
  \Rightarrow \frac{1 + \frac{m}{n}}{1 - \frac{1}{n}} p_t > \frac{n + m}{n - 1}
  \]
  \[
  \Rightarrow \frac{1 + \frac{m}{n}}{1 - \frac{1}{n}} p_t > \frac{n + m}{n - 1}
  \]
  \[
  \Rightarrow \frac{1 + \frac{m}{n}}{1 - \frac{1}{n}} p_t > \frac{n + m}{n - 1}
  \]
  \[
  \Rightarrow \frac{1 + \frac{m}{n}}{1 - \frac{1}{n}} p_t > \frac{n + m}{n - 1}
  \]

**Proof of Equation 3.**

\[
F_i(v) = P(1 - E < v)
\]
\[
= P(1 - (2 \cdot (1 - e_i) - 1) < v)
\]
\[
= P(1 - \left(2 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{r}{100}\right) - 1\right) < v)
\]
\[
= P(1 - \tilde{r} < v)
\]
\[
= 1 - P(\tilde{r} < 1 - v)
\]
\[
= v
\]

The last step follows since \(\tilde{r}\) is uniformly distributed over \([0, 1]\).

**Proof of Equation 7.**

\[
\hat{b}(v) = \int_0^v x^{N-1} dx
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{v^{N-1}} \int_0^v x^{N-1} dx
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{v^{N-1}} \cdot \frac{v^N}{N}
\]
\[
= \frac{v^N}{N v^{N-1}}
\]
\[
= \frac{v}{N}
\]
\[
= v - \frac{v^N}{N}
\]

\[
\boxed{302}
\]
