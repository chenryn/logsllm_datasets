### Publicly Available Routing Tables and Their Limitations

Publicly available routing tables often contain biases, errors, and false route advertisements. To address these issues, future work may involve cross-validating our map with different data sources and mapping algorithms.

### Router-Level Topology Estimation

Router-level mapping of Autonomous System (AS) structures involves using traceroute probes from various PlanetLab hosts to IP addresses within the ASes. This method is limited by the fraction of routers that can be discovered through traceroute probes, as some routers and middleboxes are configured not to respond to ping and traceroute requests. To mitigate this, we use Paris Traceroute with TCP probes. Additionally, we launched traceroute probes from PlanetLab nodes, as the looking-glass servers, which were originally used, were unavailable during our tests. Despite these efforts, there is always a chance that some routes may not be covered. Increasing the number of probing hosts could improve topology estimation, as new paths may be discovered from different vantage points.

### Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we have made two key contributions to the question of how to best place Decoy Routers (DRs) in the Internet:

1. **Small Set of Candidate ASes:**
   - We demonstrate that a small set of approximately 30 candidate ASes intercepts a very large fraction (greater than 90%) of paths to sites of interest, regardless of the adversary country. This suggests that placing DRs in these ASes is sufficient to build a global DR framework. Current approaches require collaboration with over 800 ASes for a single adversary like Venezuela or China.
   - We also observe that if censorious regimes, such as China, attempt to filter traffic along the paths transiting these 30 ASes, they will not only censor their own citizens but also many others residing outside their network boundaries, causing collateral damage.

2. **Router-Level Placement:**
   - We explore the placement of DRs not only at the AS-level but also at the router level. An AS is not a simple entity; it may have thousands of routers, and it is not immediately clear which of these should be replaced with DRs.
   - Our findings indicate that to intercept a large fraction of paths through an AS, a significant number of both edge and core routers are needed—typically several hundred. In some cases, such as Quest Communications and Verizon, well over 1,500 routers are required.

### Practical Feasibility and Incentives

Setting up a worldwide DR framework may require the collaboration of a small set of ASes (approximately 30). However, even a single key AS, on average, will need several hundred routers to intercept all the paths. We conclude that building a worldwide DR infrastructure is practically feasible, but ASes need sufficiently strong incentives to deploy a total of over 11,700 DRs. We will explore such issues in our future work.

### GAO AS-Level Mapping

Our end-to-end AS-level path inference algorithm follows the approach outlined by Gao [13]. The key idea is to construct paths based on the routing information in existing BGP routing tables. Specifically, the process estimates paths from an IP-prefix to every other AS in the Internet.

#### Inputs and Process
- **Inputs:** Existing BGP RIBs, collected by the RouteViews project [27] from Internet Exchange Points (IXes), where multiple ASes peer.
- **Sure Paths:** Paths directly obtained from RIBs are termed sure paths. ASes on sure paths are called Base ASes. For example, in the (hypothetical) path 2869 − 3586 − 49561 − 58556 − 10348 192.168.1.12/24, each number represents an AS. The path originates at AS2869 and terminates at AS10348, the home AS of the advertised prefix 192.168.1.12/24. Note that the suffixes of sure paths are themselves also sure paths.
- **Path Extension:** The algorithm computes new paths by extending sure paths to other ASes to which there are no explicitly-known paths (from the prefix concerned). The extended path must be loop-free and satisfy the Valley-Free Property [26].

#### Steps:
1. **Selection of Sure Paths:** For each prefix, all sure paths (containing all the base ASes) are selected.
2. **Extension to New ASes:** The algorithm searches for ASes in existing RIBs that share valid business relations with the end ASes of paths. [We used the relationships presented by CAIDA [14].]
3. **Edge Assumption:** An edge is assumed to extend a sure path by one hop.
4. **Tie-Breaking:** 
   - The algorithm sorts the possible paths and selects the shortest path to the prefix.
   - In case of a tie, the path with minimum uncertainty (length of the inferred path extensions) is chosen.
   - If there is still a tie, the path with the higher frequency index (the number of times a sure path actually appears in the RIBs) is selected.
5. **Data Structures Update:** Appropriate data structures, such as the frequency with which an edge appears in the RIBs, the uncertainty of the extended path, and the new path length, are updated.

### Path Frequency vs. Customer-Cone Size

We provide details for our claim in Section 6.4 that customer-cone size is not a reliable metric to identify the ASes that transport a large fraction of traffic. We explain our reasoning with the example of the AS graph in Figure 11.

#### Hypothetical AS Graph
- **Node A:** Represents an AS with the highest customer-cone size of 6, the total number of ASes that A can reach via its customers and their customers (D, B, E, F, C, G).
- **Nodes B and C:** Have customer cones of size 2 (for each of the individual nodes).

#### Valid Valley-Free Paths
- There are several valid valley-free paths in this hypothetical AS graph: D−B−E, D−B−C−F, D−B−C−G, D−B−A−C−F, D−B−A−C−G, E−B−A−C−F, and E−B−A−C−G. However, not all of them pass through the root AS, i.e., the node with the highest customer-cone size. This is also evident from Table 5, where for several large ASes, a considerable fraction of paths do not traverse the core ASes themselves but do traverse their immediate (1-hop) customers.

#### Correlation Analysis
- Customer cone size is not well correlated with path frequency. The Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient is only ≈ 0.2 (see Figure 12).
