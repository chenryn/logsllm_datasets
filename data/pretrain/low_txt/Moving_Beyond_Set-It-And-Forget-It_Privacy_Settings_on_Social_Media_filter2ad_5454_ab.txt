### Highlighting a Post’s Potential Audience and Impact

Some researchers have proposed using machine learning to predict a post’s initial privacy settings. For instance, Fang and LeFevre employed active learning and friend clustering to predict fine-grained privacy settings [23]. Other studies have developed predictive models for computing inter-user tie strength [28], user-level privacy scores [46], privacy risk [83], and the privacy similarity between users [27]. More recently, Fiesler et al. constructed a logistic regression model to predict whether a post should be public [24]. Supervised learning has also been used to understand private information disclosure attacks in online social networks, particularly for sensitive attribute inference [26, 29, 39, 43, 82], sensitive relationship inference [10, 81], and identity matching across platforms [80].

While these efforts focus on helping users choose the initial privacy setting for a post at the time it is posted, our research aims to assist users in identifying posts where the initial privacy setting no longer aligns with their current preferences. We build on these prior models by incorporating features they found to be predictive, adding other features, and testing different model architectures.

A frequently proposed and sometimes implemented idea is to allow users to set an “expiration date” for their posts [3] or to otherwise limit the duration of information sharing. For example, Snapchat messages disappear after a few seconds [56], Instagram stories vanish after 24 hours [32], and the visibility of WeChat moments can be restricted to three days, six months, or forever [77]. However, prior work has shown that users' predictions about future changes in the visibility of their posts often do not match their later preferences when revisiting those posts [6].

### User Study Methodology

To understand Facebook users’ longitudinal privacy attitudes and practices, document the extent to which retrospective reevaluation of privacy settings is needed, and collect data to build and test predictive models, we conducted a user study. We investigated these questions using data collected from two surveys and an anonymized version of each participant’s full Facebook timeline and activity log (collected with consent).

#### Recruitment and Survey 1

Participants were recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, located in North America, aged 18 or older, and with a 95%+ approval rating. We screened participants using their account data to ensure they met our inclusion criteria: (i) having a Facebook account for at least 2 years and (ii) making at least 10 posts in the last year. Participants volunteered, installed our browser extension, and completed Survey 1, which covered their overall Facebook usage, use of Facebook’s privacy features, and demographics. Participants were compensated $10 for each survey. The survey instruments are provided in Appendices A–B.

#### Ethical Collection of Facebook Data

Our goals for data collection were to ensure privacy and obtain explicit, fully informed consent from participants. We designed a protocol using a browser extension that collects data in a privacy-preserving manner. This protocol was approved by our IRB. Our infrastructure enables us to collect, with the participant’s permission, anonymized versions of their full Facebook timeline and activity log. We only stored anonymized data, using one-way hashes for unique identifiers and avoiding the storage of photos. Despite our best efforts, some collected data might still contain PII that is hard to detect automatically. Our anonymization strategy is similar to Facebook’s App-Scoped IDs [17]. We never attempted to deanonymize any account.

#### Survey 2

Survey 2 consisted of two parts. In Part 1, we embedded links to five randomly selected posts from the participant’s timeline, showing the current privacy setting and asking if the participant had ever changed (or considered changing) that setting. We also asked whether they wanted to keep that privacy setting or choose a different one moving forward, and why. Unlike earlier studies [4, 6], we reminded participants of their current privacy setting and made “keep this setting” the first option to minimize friction.

In Part 2, we revisited the same five posts, showing the participant six specific Facebook friends who could currently see each post. We asked whether the participant preferred to continue sharing that post with that person, or if they did not care, to differentiate strong preferences from indifference or a default preference.

#### Data Analysis

We performed statistical testing to investigate our targeted quantitative hypotheses and built and evaluated statistical models using standard measures like accuracy, precision, and recall. Two researchers independently coded free-text responses using a shared codebook, achieving substantial to perfect agreement (Cohen’s κ ranging from 0.7 to 1). Disagreements were resolved in meetings.

#### Limitations

A core limitation is the use of a convenience sample of North American MTurk workers, with only 78 participants. However, our sample included participants with wide variations in account age and daily usage. Our results likely underestimated privacy needs, as highly privacy-sensitive individuals would be unlikely to participate. Even so, 13.9% of posts seen by participants were desired to be restricted. Our sample was English-speaking US Facebook users, so results may not generalize to other languages or countries. We only considered visible interactions on Facebook, missing offline interactions, but our goal is to build predictive models using only online data.

### Retrospective Preferences

Here, we characterize participants’ retrospective access control preferences for their old Facebook posts. Our results reinforce the need for automated assistance in reviewing access control (privacy) settings for aging Facebook posts.

#### Participants’ Demographics

A total of 101 participants installed our plugin and completed Survey 1. However, 13 participants did not meet our inclusion criteria, so we invited the remaining 88 participants to complete Survey 2. Of these, 78 completed Survey 2, and their responses are analyzed. For these 78 participants, we collected preferred privacy settings for 390 posts and 2,340 friend-post pairs. The posts had a median age of 2.6 years (minimum 9.9 days, maximum 9.9 years).

**Basic demographics:**
- 69% identified as female, and the rest as male.
- 46% of participants were in the 25–34 age range.
- 87% identified as white, and 9% as black.
- 18% held a degree or job in computer science or a similar field.

**Facebook usage:**
- 89.7% reported daily Facebook use, with a median usage of 1 hour per day.
- 55 of the 78 participants had accounts at least 10 years old.
- Participants made a total of 253,122 posts, with the median participant making 1,840 posts.
- Activity logs showed significant non-post activity, such as liking other posts or watching videos.

#### Temporal Changes in Facebook Usage

In Survey 1, participants reported the primary topics of their Facebook posts at three points in time: one year after creating their account, at the time of the survey, and halfway between the two. Most participants posted about their personal lives, including humorous content and family updates. Only 5 participants (6.4%) said posting personal life updates was their primary activity at the time of the study, while 15 participants (19.2%) said it was their primary activity at the midpoint of their account lifetime.

We also asked participants about the peak year of their Facebook usage and how their current usage compares. On average, participants reported their usage peaked 5.6 years ago (σ = 3.4, median = 5). Two-thirds reported spending less time on Facebook than during their peak year. This evolution in Facebook usage further motivates the need for retrospective privacy-management tools.

**Increasing audiences:**
For the 55 participants with accounts at least a decade old, we analyzed how their set of Facebook friends changed over time. Figure 2 shows the percentage of participants’ current friends added over the past years. Our observed distribution of privacy settings on pre-2011 posts suggests a recent and significant restriction of the visibility of old posts. The introduction of the “limit past posts” feature in 2011 may have contributed to this trend.
