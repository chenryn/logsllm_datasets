## Abstract
Users often set and forget their privacy settings when posting on social media. However, changes in users' lives, relationships, and the platforms themselves can lead to mismatches between the active and desired privacy settings. The importance of managing these settings, combined with the high volume of posts and friend interactions, necessitates a semi-automated approach. We address this problem through a user study and the development of an automated inference system for identifying potentially mismatched privacy settings. In our study, 78 Facebook users reevaluated the privacy settings for five of their posts and indicated whether specific friends should have access. This data was used to design a classifier that identifies posts with incorrect sharing settings, achieving a 317% improvement over a baseline classifier based on friend interaction. We also found that many useful features can be collected without user intervention, and we identified directions for improving the classifier's accuracy.

## 1 Introduction
When users share data on social media, they must consider the intended audience, personal preferences, and broader context. Often, the access control decision is "set it and forget it," meaning the initial setting persists until changed, even if the user's circumstances change. For example, a Facebook post from 2006, when a user had 100 friends, may have different implications in 2019 when the user has 2,000 friends. The cognitive burden of reevaluating privacy settings, compounded by the volume of posts, makes manual management nearly impossible.

While a fully manual approach is untenable, many predictive features are personal and require user input. This calls for an iterative, breadth-first approach where features are derived from deep user interaction. The goal is to minimize incorrect privacy settings, avoid interrupting users, and limit data collection.

To understand the risks and identify useful features, we conducted a study with 78 Facebook users. Participants reevaluated the privacy settings for five posts and indicated whether six selected friends should have access. Our participants were active users, with 71% having accounts at least a decade old, providing insight into the longitudinal evolution of Facebook privacy settings. We found that the most common setting was "Friends only," and the median participant had four times as many friends in 2018 as in 2009. Despite 45% of participants using Facebook’s “privacy checkup,” many settings did not reflect current intentions. Overall, 65.3% of participants wanted to change the privacy setting of at least one post, representing 25.5% of the posts they saw.

Using insights from the user study, we built models to predict which posts are likely to have outdated privacy settings and which posts should not be shared with specific friends. Our model achieved a 317% improvement in accuracy compared to simple prediction rules. We found that the most predictive features can be collected without human interaction, and observable friendship dynamics alone are insufficient predictors.

## 2 Facebook Privacy Settings
Facebook users control access to their posts via the Audience Selector, which includes settings such as:
- **Public**: Anyone on the web.
- **Friends+**: The user’s Facebook friends plus the friends of some/all of those friends.
- **Friends**: The user’s Facebook friends.
- **Custom**: A user-specified subset of Facebook friends.
- **Only Me**: Only the user.

Facebook has varied the default settings over time, complicating longitudinal privacy management. The default was "friends plus networks" in 2008, "public" in 2010, and "friends" in 2014.

## 3 Proposed Implementation
Our goal is to build a human-in-the-loop retrospective privacy management system. Suggested privacy setting modifications would be presented to users through an interface similar to the “people you may know” feature on social media sites. The objective is to balance accuracy with the importance of the suggested change, ensuring users retain agency over decisions like adding friends or revoking access to shared posts.

## 4 Related Work
Privacy settings on social media can be considered a form of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Mismanagement of Facebook privacy settings can be caused by user misunderstandings, mismatches between actual and expected content dissemination, and overly complex user interfaces. Previous studies have shown that users often expose posts to larger audiences than desired, leading to embarrassment and regret.

### 4.1 Longitudinal Privacy on Facebook
Use of social media platforms changes over time, with significant turnover in a user’s set of close friends. Privacy behaviors also evolve, with increased non-public content in profile attributes. Changes in friends and life events necessitate retrospective management of privacy settings. Prior work has documented the need to revisit privacy settings for past posts, but our study collects a richer set of features and explicitly shows participants the current privacy setting of each post.

### 4.2 Helping Users Choose Privacy Settings
Researchers have proposed various strategies to help users choose privacy settings, including audience-centric views of posts and the ability to assign friends to custom groups. Facebook has adopted some of these techniques. Researchers have also suggested new visualizations of privacy settings and automated "nudges" to guide users.

This paper contributes to the understanding of longitudinal privacy management on social media and takes the first steps toward building human-in-the-loop interfaces for identifying posts with outdated privacy settings.
