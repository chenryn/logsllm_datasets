### One Diurnal Phase (i.e., Less Than 24 Hours)

A significant early work on botnets is [CJ05], which highlights the use of centralized control structures for data collection in Section 2. We concur with [CJ05] that centralized botnet Command and Control (C&C) is not always guaranteed, and more research is needed. Our model focuses on tracking propagation and is independent of this view.

Bots are often specialized worms, so our work builds on the existing worm literature. The utility of our model assumes that administrators can detect and analyze worms in a semi-automated manner to determine the scanning rate and identify the target vulnerability. We have not delved into this in detail, as tools like honeyd [Pro03] and others [YBP05, DQG+04] have effectively demonstrated the required detection capabilities.

Biological models of epidemics have long noted the importance of dormancy in propagation [DH00]. This corresponds to the diurnal factors in our model, which treats nighttime as a form of natural quarantine or dormancy for malware. Similarly, biological models have emphasized the role of spatial dispersion, demography, and other categorical factors in propagation [DG99]. In our time zone model, these factors are represented by geographic zones. Computer models of malware, including ours, differ from these approaches because contact in a computer network is not restricted, and transmission can occur between any peers on the Internet.

### Conclusion

Botnets will continue to grow and evolve, and the research community must keep pace. Time zones play a crucial role in botnet growth dynamics, and factors such as the time of release are important for short-term spread rates. The data we observed in our sinkhole highlighted the significance of time zones and the time of day, motivating the development of a diurnal model. This model was more accurate than the basic SIR models currently in use and accurately predicted botnet population growth. Additionally, understanding the diurnal shaping functions allows one to identify release times that maximize malware spread. This enables the comparison of two given botnets and their prioritization based on short-term propagation potential. Since deriving the diurnal shaping function \(\phi(t)\) for each time zone requires extensive data collection, it is unlikely that botmasters can accurately predict optimal release times.

### Future Work

Our future work will extend the diurnal model to address email-spreading viruses. By studying the rate of propagation and new victim recruitment observed in sinkhole studies, we aim to develop a more accurate model of email virus propagation. We will also explore new techniques to sample botnet populations, allowing us to further study botnets that do not use centralized C&C systems. So far, our work has identified time zone and the time of release as key factors in short-term virus propagation. We plan to investigate other possible variables, such as the mix of operating systems, patch levels, and the variety of applications used on infected systems.
