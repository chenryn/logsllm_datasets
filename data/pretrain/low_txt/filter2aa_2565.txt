#### Overview
This talk introduces a hacking device called CatchWire, which is designed to operate on gigabit Ethernet networks. The device, manufactured by WAW Technologies, runs Deck Linux and offers multiple command and control (C2) and exfiltration options.

#### Key Features
- **Network Integration**: Can be installed on various network segments.
- **Remote Control**: Supports IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee and cellular networks for remote access.
- **Flexibility**: Small, flexible, and easily integrated into sophisticated penetration tests.
- **Installation Options**:
  - Data center: Capture all packets.
  - LAN segment: Target specific parts of an organization.
  - Inline to a single PC: Focus on a specific target.
  - Unused desk: Bypass perimeter defenses.

#### Talk Structure
1. Introduction to the CatchWire
2. Introduction to Deck Linux
3. Attacks from CatchWire or BeagleBone Black (BBB)
4. CatchWire-specific attacks
5. Future Directions

### Meet the CatchWire
- **Formerly LUNA (Little Universal Network Appliance)**: Similar to the BeagleBone Black (BBB) but with additional features.
- **Key Features**:
  - Two gigabit Ethernet interfaces
  - Power over Ethernet (PoE)
  - Integrated FTDI USB to UART
  - No HDMI or GPIO headers

### CatchWire: Hardware
- **Base OS**: Built on Ubuntu 14.04, optimized for pentesting with BBB, CatchWire, and similar devices.
- **Pre-installed Packages**: Over 4000 packages (fluff-free).
- **MeshDeck**: Adds remote control via 802.15.4/ZigBee networking, allowing coordinated attacks with multiple remote drones.
- **AirDeck**: Combined with MeshDeck, enables airborne drone or router capabilities.
- **4Deck**: Forensic add-on that automatically writes blocks to USB mass storage devices (udev rules-based).
- **Udeck**: USB-based attacks (more details in another talk).

### Powering the CatchWire
- **Power over Ethernet (PoE)**: Best option when available; power can be passed through using jumpers.
- **DC Adapter**: Alternative power source.
- **USB Power**: Can be powered via a USB charger (2A or greater), but not when Ethernet is in use due to USB 2.0 power limitations (500 mA).

### Initial Configuration
1. Obtain the image from [facstaff.bloomu.edu/ppolstra](http://facstaff.bloomu.edu/ppolstra).
2. Create a microSD card using the provided script (16 GB+).
3. Install the microSD card into the CatchWire.
4. Remove screws from the microUSB socket side and slide out.
5. Connect to a PC via USB.
6. Log in as `ubuntu/temppwd`.
7. Add and configure software as needed.

### Booting via USB Power from PC
- Follow the steps to boot the CatchWire via USB power from a PC.

### Selecting a Network Configuration
- **Default**: Bridge two Ethernet ports.
- **Splitting Ports**:
  - `cd /boot/uboot/dtbs`
  - `cp am335x-luna-demac.dtb am335x-luna.dtb`
  - Comment out all lines in `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules`
- **Reverting**:
  - Uncomment lines in `70-persistent-net-rules`
  - `cp am335x-luna-switch.dtb` over `am335x-luna.dtb`

### Installing the MeshDeck
- **Features**:
  - Remote control and exfiltration up to 2 miles (3.2 km) without gateways/extenders.
  - Out-of-band communication for most targets.
  - Easy integration into multi-device pentests.
  - Star network via IEEE 802.15.4 (Xbee series 1 adapters).
  - Mesh network via ZigBee (Xbee series 2 or ZB adapters).
  - Requires a USB Xbee adapter.
  - See DC21 talk and/or "Hacking & Penetration Testing with Low Power Devices" for more details.
  - Permits access to CatchWire when Ethernet is blocked.

### Demo: Exploiting an Old Friend
- **Sniffing Traffic**:
  - Install CatchWire inline for a LAN segment.
  - Capture all traffic to/from a host and pipe to `egrep` to extract login credentials.
  - Example: `tcpdump -n host 192.168.1.120 -v -A | egrep '(USER\ )|(PASS\ )'`

### Using Wireshark with CatchWire
- **Setup**:
  - Enable root login in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` by changing `PermitRootLogin without-password` to `PermitRootLogin yes`.
  - Use `tcpdump` filters to manage traffic.
  - Example: `ssh root@catchwire "/usr/sbin/tcpdump -s0 -w -" | wireshark -k -i -`

### Other Possibilities
- **MeshDeck**:
  - Announce CatchWire IP address.
  - Toggle and focus sniffing.
  - Inject packets.
  - Communicate cracked passwords to other hacking drones running Deck Linux.
- **Online Password Cracking**: Use Hydra.
- **Social Engineering**:
  - Add stickers from the IT department to the CatchWire.
  - Sell it as a network extender or performance booster.
