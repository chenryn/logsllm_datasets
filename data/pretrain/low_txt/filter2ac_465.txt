**Title: BotConf 2013 - Back to Life, Back to Correlation**

In this presentation, I will delve into the distinctive characteristics of botnet behavior and explore effective methods for detecting such activity while minimizing false positives. I will discuss how we can gather information from across the IT infrastructure, using multiple layers of correlation and contextual metadata, to accurately identify botnet infections and activities.

Furthermore, I will explain how the enrichment of raw data with contextual information can be leveraged to develop and deploy Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), thereby enhancing detection capabilities. This is made possible through the use of a relatively new trend in the security industry known as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM).

In recent years, many leading players in IT security have recognized the growing demand for SIEM solutions and have acquired companies that offer this technology.
