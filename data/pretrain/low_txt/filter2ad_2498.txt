**Abstract:**
The Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) is designed to integrate services within and across enterprises. Given the differences between scientific and enterprise applications, numerous technical issues must be addressed to achieve this integration. This panel will focus on the challenge of ensuring dependable operation in Grid computing. Dependability encompasses a range of attributes, including availability, reliability, security, and timely execution. The discussion will cover different dependability requirements for current and envisioned application scenarios, technical barriers to achieving dependability, and architectural issues related to providing appropriate support in software platforms such as OGSA. The goal is to bring together perspectives from various communities to identify and address the remaining challenges in making dependable Grid computing a reality.

**Overview:**
For over a decade, researchers in scientific computing have been exploring technologies that enable advanced scientific applications to leverage resources from machines connected by wide-area networks across large geographical distances. Initially referred to as metacomputing or heterogeneous computing, Grid computing is now the most common term for this distributed computing model. Grid computing emphasizes large-scale resource sharing, including computational cycles, software, and data, across administrative domains in a flexible, secure, and coordinated manner. Several software platforms, such as Condor, Entropia, Globus Toolkit, Legion, LSF, Ninf, and Sun’s Grid Engine, have been developed to address the challenges associated with Grid computing.

While the Grid was initially designed to support scientific applications, there has been significant interest in extending it to meet the needs of enterprise computing, including those based on Web services. For example, IBM and Sun have incorporated the Grid into their enterprise computing strategies, and the recent Global Grid Forum (GGF-4) included several topics related to generalizing the Grid for broader use. Part of this effort involves defining an Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) that can be used to integrate services within and across enterprises.
