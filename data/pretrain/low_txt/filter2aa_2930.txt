## Introduction
The call is coming from inside the house! Are you ready for the next evolution in DDoS attacks?

### The Promise of IoT
IoT (Internet of Things) promises:
- More personalized and automated services
- Better understanding of customer needs
- Optimized availability and use of resources
- Lower costs
- Improved health
- Service and efficiency gains
- Lower environmental impact

### Characteristics of IoT Devices
To fulfill these promises, IoT devices are typically:
- Easy to deploy
- Easy to use
- Require minimal configuration
- Low cost

### The IoT Problem: Security
However, the security of IoT devices is a significant concern. Unprecedented DDoS attack sizes have been observed, such as the Mirai infections in December 2017:
- 1 million login attempts from November 29 to December 12, 2017, from 92,000 unique IP addresses
- More than one attempt per minute in some regions

### Current Situation
- An unprotected IoT device on the internet will be infected within one minute.
- An IoT device located behind a NAT (Network Address Translation) device or a firewall is not accessible from the internet and is therefore mostly secure.
- However, in January 2017, this all changed.

### Windows-Based IoT Infections
- Desktop malware spreading multi-platform malware is not new.
- Increasingly common techniques include:
  - HackingTeam RCS
  - WireLurker
  - DualToy
  - “BackStab” campaign
- Banking trojans also target mobile devices to steal 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) and SMS authorization codes.
- IoT devices present a new and ripe infection vector.
- "Windows Mirai" is the first known multi-platform trojan to target IoT devices for infection.

### Background
- **HackingTeam RCS**: A well-known implant sold to nation-state organizations for monitoring and spying purposes. It has clients for Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, Blackberry, and Windows Phone.
- **WireLurker**: An intermediate infector that targets macOS instead of Windows, installing malicious/risky iOS apps on non-jailbroken devices via side-loading.
- **DualToy**: Infects both Android and iOS devices via Windows hosts, installs ADB (Android Debug Bridge) and iTunes drivers, and steals various device information.

### "Windows Mirai"
- **Initial Reports**: Reported in early 2017 by Palo Alto Networks (PAN) and later by multiple organizations.
- **Origin**: Appears to be Chinese in origin, not related to nation-states.
- **Versions**: Discovered samples date back to at least March 2016, with the latest known version being 1.0.0.7.
- **Spreading Mechanisms**:
  - Spreads to Windows via MySQL and MSSQL stored procedures.
  - Scans for Windows credentials via RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) and WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation).
  - Spreads to Linux/IoT via Telnet scan and uses 'wget' or 'tftp' to download IoT malware loaders.
  - Newer versions can also echo the loader stored as a resource in the PE file.
- **CnC (Command and Control)**: Uses multiple different CnC hosts and hardcodes DNS to a popular Chinese-based public DNS server.

### Implications and Consequences
- **Zombie Horde**: A single infected Windows computer can now infect and subvert the "innocent" IoT population into zombies, all under the control of the attacker.
- **Attacker's Arsenal**:
  - Perform reconnaissance.
  - Infect other IoT devices.
  - Launch attacks against external and internal targets.

### Network Impact
- **Scanning Activity**: Generates a flood of ARP requests and lots of small packets, including TCP SYN’s. As more devices get infected, scanning activity increases, potentially causing serious issues and outages with network devices like firewalls, switches, and other stateful devices.
- **Outbound DDoS Attacks**: Attack activity generates a lot of traffic, including UDP/ICMP/TCP packet flooding, reflection attacks, application-level attacks, and pseudo-random DNS label prefix attacks. This traffic quickly fills up internal WAN links and causes havoc with any stateful device on the path, including Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs).

### Internal Threats
- **Reconnaissance and Internally Facing Attacks**: A clever attacker would scan the internal network to identify vulnerable services and network layout, launch attacks against routing tables, and perform DDoS attacks against internal services. This can be devastating if there are no internal barriers in place.
- **Impact on Network Devices**: If an attacker can force a device to spend cycles on processing packets, it won't have cycles to send or process critical packets. A carefully crafted 300 pps (packets per second) flood against typical high-end routers/switches can cause them to lose their routing adjacencies.

### Defending Against Insider Threats
- **Security Best Practices (BCPs)**:
  - Implement full network segmentation and harden (or isolate) vulnerable network devices and services.
  - Develop a DDoS attack mitigation process.
  - Utilize flow telemetry to analyze external and internal traffic.
  - Deploy multi-layered DDoS protection.
  - Scan for misconfigured and abusable services, including NTP, DNS, and SSDP services.
  - Implement anti-spoofing mechanisms such as Unicast Reverse-Path Forwarding, ACLs, DHCP Snooping, and IP Source Guard on all edge devices.

### Conclusion
The Windows spreader has opened up the possibility to infect internal IoT devices and use them against you. Internal network defenses and security architectures need to be adapted to meet this new threat. Implementing Security BCPs will help reduce the impact of internal DDoS and secure networks against other security threats.
