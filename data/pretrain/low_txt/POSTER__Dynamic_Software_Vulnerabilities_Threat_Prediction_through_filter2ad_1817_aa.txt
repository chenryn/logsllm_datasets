## Abstract
Publicly available software vulnerabilities and exploit codes are often exploited by malicious actors to launch cyberattacks on vulnerable targets. Therefore, organizations need not only to update their software but also to implement effective patch management and prioritize patching schedules. To prevent future cyber threats based on publicly available resources on the Internet, this study proposes a dynamic vulnerability threat assessment model to predict the likelihood of exploitation for each vulnerability (i.e., CVE). The model considers various aspects of vulnerabilities gathered from multiple sources, including profile information and contextual information from Twitter discussions. When applied to real-world data, our approach demonstrated better prediction accuracy and has been integrated into our threat intelligence platform as one of the analytic functions.

## Introduction
Vulnerabilities and their discussions are frequently found on internet forums, with social media platforms becoming major channels for such information exchange. This study aims to utilize messages on Twitter regarding vulnerabilities to assess the probability that a vulnerability will be exploited in the real world. In addition to Twitter messages, we extract features from vulnerability databases such as NVD, CVE Details, VulDB, ExploitDB, and Symantec to describe each vulnerability.

Cybercriminals use public vulnerability information to develop exploit codes, which they then use to target vulnerable systems. Current security measures often analyze malicious activities after breaches occur, which is a reactive approach that is not effective for critical infrastructure. There is a significant theoretical gap in current cyber defense architecture [1].

Online vulnerability discussions can provide security professionals with first-hand information to avoid potential cyberattacks. Sabottke et al. [2] explored early exploit detection using Twitter data, employing a Random Forest model and ground truth from ExploitDB [3] and Symantec attack signatures [4]. Sapienza et al. [5] introduced a framework that generates warnings of imminent or current cyber threats by leveraging unconventional, public data sources like Twitter and the Darknet. Their system monitors social media feeds from prominent security researchers, analysts, and white-hat hackers, applying text mining techniques to identify important terms and remove irrelevant ones.

Several studies have utilized social media data for predicting vulnerability exploits, such as those by Sauerwein et al. [6], Khandpur et al. [7], Almukaynizi et al. [8][9], Hernandez-Suarez et al. [10], Shu et al. [11], and Tavabi et al. [12]. Twitter data is a valuable intelligence source because exploits are often discussed on the platform before they are publicly disclosed [2][5], and the Twitter activities of security experts are a promising source for anticipating cyber threats.

## Proposed Method
In this study, we propose a dynamic vulnerability threat assessment model to predict the likelihood of exploitation for each vulnerability (i.e., CVE). The proposed approach is illustrated in Figure 1. For input features, we consider both basic profile features of vulnerabilities collected from multiple sources and Twitter data related to all vulnerabilities with a CVE number. For all tweets about vulnerabilities, we use reserved cybersecurity-related keywords and count their frequency.

The data we collected covers the period from 1999 to 2019 and includes sources such as NVD, CVE Details, VulDB, and Twitter. We used the feature importance of Random Forest for feature selection, randomly picking 90% of the data for training and 10% for testing. From 98 features, we selected the top 49 features with the highest variable importance scores generated by Random Forest after five runs of experiments. Understanding which features are most relevant to predicting real-world exploits is crucial. Figure 2 shows the model features for exploit prediction, with a total of 49 features used in our prediction models.

Together with the extracted features and ground truth, sample data for training and testing our classifier were obtained in the format of vulnerabilities described by features and exploited/not-exploited labels. Three sources were used to identify the set of vulnerabilities exploited in the real world: ExploitDB (exploit code) and Symantec (Symantec attack signature). These sources report vulnerabilities that have been exploited and serve as the ground truth to label the vulnerabilities.

For the proposed algorithm, we applied Random Forest (RF) [13] as the prediction model because it can handle both numerical and categorical data, unlike SVM. The modern practice of random forests includes: (1) using out-of-bag error as an estimate of the generalization error and (2) measuring variable importance through permutation. For Twitter vulnerability mentions, we used keywords suggested by Sabottke et al. [2], manually reserved by human experts, and generated by the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. Sabottke et al. [2] identified effective keywords in exploit prediction by calculating their mutual information.
