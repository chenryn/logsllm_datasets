# 8. Limitations and Open Issues

We embarked on this project with ambitious goals, yet we have only scratched the surface. In this section, we outline the limitations of our evaluation, caveats associated with our findings, and open issues for future research.

### 8.1. Representativeness of the Dataset

The hundreds of users in our device mobility dataset may not be a representative sample of smartphone users, either today or in a future Internet. However, given the lack of existing datasets on network mobility (as opposed to physical mobility) of devices, we believe our measurements are an important and necessary first step in developing meaningful mobility datasets for comparing different architectures. An alternative approach could have been to develop an abstract model, such as the equivalent of a random-waypoint model [56] for network mobility. However, such an abstract model would need validation through empirical measurements, like those presented here, to be convincing.

### 8.2. Future Network Environments

Our evaluation is based on current routing topologies, policies, access network diversity, and content locations, which may differ significantly in the future. These aspects could be influenced by the very architectures we seek to evaluate if they were widely adopted. While our findings are limited to network environments similar to today's Internet, we note that the qualitative nature of our results is unlikely to change even if the extent of device or content mobility were altered significantly.

### 8.3. Content Mobility Characterization

We characterized content mobility by measuring changes in resolved IP addresses associated with domain names. This implicitly assumes that a purely name-based routing network will announce content domain names from all locations, including CDN locations, where they reside today. It is possible, and even likely, that popular content will be announced from fewer primary locations with less flux in a name-based architecture that leverages on-path caching (e.g., NDN). This would strengthen our favorable assessment of name-based routing for handling the update cost of content mobility.

### 8.4. Scope and Goals

Our evaluation and goals have some limitations. We focused on three pure strategies for location-independence but did not explore the many possible combinations of these strategies in a network architecture. For example, we did not consider exploiting indirection points within a name-based routing system [27]. Additionally, network architecture design is part science and part art, and not everything can be easily quantified. What is easily quantifiable may not be the most pressing concern. Nevertheless, pushing the boundaries of what is quantifiable is valuable for scientific discourse, and our work is a first step in that direction.

### 8.5. Trade-offs in Name-Based Routing

Within the confines of the three purist approaches, our empirical focus constrained the trade-offs we could evaluate. For name-based routing, we empirically evaluated metrics such as update cost and forwarding table size but did not consider other control plane metrics like routing convergence delays or data plane metrics like forwarding traffic or user-perceived path stretch with on-path caching. On-path content caching can benefit most architectures, including those based on name resolution like the Internet (e.g., transparent caching today) or MobilityFirst [48], but it does not ensure reachability to at least one copy of the requested content.

### 8.6. Controlled Flooding Strategies

Our methodology considers one class of controlled flooding strategies that generalize routing and forwarding strategies used in today's Internet. As noted in Section 3.3.3, the fungibility of costs between update cost, forwarding table size, and forwarding traffic allows for other exotic architectural alternatives whose cost-benefit trade-offs are harder to analyze. Investigating these more sophisticated forwarding strategies is an interesting avenue for future research, as also suggested by calls for a stateful forwarding plane [55].

# 9. Conclusions

The pursuit of a location-independent communication abstraction has long intrigued networking researchers and has significantly influenced the design of many clean-slate Internet architectures. Despite sharing this common goal, there has been little prior work on quantitatively comparing the different cost-benefit trade-offs struck by these architectures.

As a first step towards addressing this gap, we developed a quantitative methodology to empirically evaluate three puristic approaches that drive the designs of a number of location-independent network architectures. We combined this methodology with measured traces of device and content mobility on the Internet using realistic physical and routing topologies. Based on the measured network mobility patterns of hundreds of devices using NomadLog, an Android app we developed, and hundreds of content domains, we found that pure name-based routing induces a prohibitively high update cost at routers due to device mobility. However, it induces a far lower update cost in conjunction with simple forwarding strategies for most of today’s content, which exhibits high locality.

Overall, our results suggest that recent proposals for name-based networking in their puristic form are better suited for content distribution alone. They may need to be augmented with addressing-assisted approaches like DNS or Mobile IP to handle device mobility and serve as a general-purpose replacement for the TCP/IP Internet.
