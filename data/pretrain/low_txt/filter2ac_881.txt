**Title: Black Hat US-22: Attacks from a New Front Door in 4G & 5G Mobile Networks**

The introduction of APIs in the telecommunications industry is set to revolutionize the way mobile networks have operated over the past three decades. The latest 4G and 5G networks now offer enterprise customers, service providers, and application developers access to data and core network functions within the carrier's infrastructure. This access is enabled through the widely adopted HTTP-based RESTful API paradigm, facilitating the integration of various sectors, such as automotive, healthcare, and industrial applications, with 5G mobile networks.

In this talk, we will unveil for the first time the practical details of the APIs that enable next-generation AI, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), and IoT applications on the latest 4G and 5G networks. Our security investigation, which examined hundreds of APIs from ten commercial providers and operators, revealed that all of them contain several of the top ten most critical API vulnerabilities. Even an average attacker can easily exploit these vulnerabilities, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and potentially disrupting the operation of billions of IoT devices that rely on these advanced mobile networks.

We will highlight the security loopholes in telecom exposure APIs and emphasize the importance of integrating robust security measures into the design of 5G and IoT networks.
