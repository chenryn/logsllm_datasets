The high eigenvector centrality of these Autonomous Systems (ASes) indicates their significant importance within the Rustock criminal network. Notably, Castle Access Inc. and Cable Bahamas are known for domain parking monetization, which explains their presence in this network.

Rustock was dismantled in March 2011 (Operation b107), but the Rustock criminal network continued to facilitate other criminal activities even after its takedown. This demonstrates that single botnet takedown approaches only address short-term threats, such as the spamming activity facilitated by the Rustock botnet. Our observations over an 8-month period revealed that 4,381 new malicious domain names per day began using this criminal infrastructure, indicating ongoing abuse.

## 5.2 MojoHost Benign Hosting Network

The MojoHost benign hosting network (Figure 3c) is an example of a legitimate hosting provider being abused by cybercriminals. It is important to clarify that we do not imply MojoHost's complicity in criminal activities; rather, malicious actors exploit it to build their criminal infrastructure. This network consists of 255 vertices and includes several distinct campaigns, or "orbiting" sub-communities, that use it as infrastructure.

The most structurally significant vertices, as indicated by their eigenvector centrality (Figure 3d), belong to a single AS (AS27589), providing redundancy for the malicious campaigns. We identified seven distinct operators using the MojoHost network, primarily for Command and Control (C&C) servers. These included three Zeus kit campaigns, two Blackhole exploit kit campaigns, and three unidentified malware family campaigns. Additionally, the network hosted three data exfiltration drop sites used by various Zeus instances.

Blackhole exploit kits facilitated drive-by downloads, infecting victims with Delf malware, which is used for the second stage of a two-stage binary drop. Most domains were registered through dynamic DNS providers, commonly used in Blackhole exploit kit instances.

Despite the benign nature of the MojoHost community, its hierarchical structure makes it resistant to AS-level takedowns. While the main support structure exists in a single AS, the orbiting communities are spread across 58 ASs. This redundancy makes it difficult to quickly cripple the network. However, maintaining such a structured hierarchy at scale may be challenging, explaining why many criminal networks observed in practice are less organized (Sections 5.1 and 5.4).

## 5.3 Botnet Criminal Network

This large botnet provides fast flux services across 1,226 vertices, mostly belonging to consumer dynamic IP address space. The graph is nearly complete with a density of 0.956 (Figure 4c). This structure maximizes redundancy through DNS agility, making it advantageous for the botnet operator. Since the graph is almost complete, most vertices are of equal importance. However, the eigenvector centrality highlights 32 vertices with lower importance, which appear to be C&C servers and data exfiltration drop sites for Zeus v2 (a.k.a. Zeus Group B) and Blackhole kit-generated malware.

To effectively disable the network, it is crucial to target the central nodes. Eliminating lower centrality nodes would disable smaller campaigns but not the larger criminal network. Many domain names in this botnet are associated with FakeAV/RogueAV threats, primarily delivered through search engine optimization poisoning techniques.

Botnet criminal networks often present as dense or complete graphs with a relatively uniform eigenvector centrality distribution. By identifying less important vertices, we can uncover underlying substructures with different functions.

## 5.4 Masterhost Criminal Network

With 3,725 vertices and 11,519 edges, the Masterhost criminal network is the largest we identified (Figure 4a). Like the Rustock network, it is sparse (graph density of 0.002) and lacks a densely malicious core. The top 10 ASes by the number of hosted malicious domains are shown in Table 2. Masterhost, a well-known bulletproof network, is the largest AS, facilitating resolutions for 12,281 domains. During our 8-month experiment, we observed a median of 1,065 new malicious domain names per day using the Masterhost network.

## 5.5 Simulating Takedowns

Using Equation 3, we identified critical vertices in the case study networks and simulated takedowns by generating network-level and domain-level takedown cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) (Figures 5 and 6, respectively). These CDFs show the proportion of networks or domain names removed against the loss in potential victim lookups. Effective takedowns result in superlinear CDFs, indicating that selectively removing few critical vertices can eliminate many potential victims.

For the Rustock and Masterhost criminal networks, network-level takedowns were highly effective (Figures 5a and 5c). Removing 20% of the Rustock network decreased total lookups by 70%, while 20% of the Masterhost network decreased lookups by 40%. Domain-level takedowns for these networks were ineffective due to the sparse graph structure (Figures 6a and 6c).

The MojoHost benign hosting network (Figures 5b and 6b) presents a challenge due to its hierarchical structure and benign infrastructure, making takedowns more difficult. For the Botnet criminal network, both network-level and domain-level takedowns were successful (Figures 5d and 6d). Eliminating 40% of the networks or domains caused an 80% and 70% decrease in total lookups, respectively. The dense structure and high availability requirements for C&C servers explain this success.

## 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a graph-based method to represent and analyze criminal network infrastructures, identifying key components and understanding how to dismantle them. We demonstrated that in smaller criminal networks, complete takedowns are possible by revoking associated domain names. For more complex cases, we provided three key metrics to identify critical components and quantified the effectiveness of our takedown measures.
