## Description
The documentation page (https://pypi.org/project/celery/) contains four broken links. These links lead to webpages or documents that no longer exist, resulting in 404 errors:
- Web link at the top of the page in the "Get Started" section:
  - "First Steps with Celery"
  - "Next Steps"
- Links in the "Documentation" section:
  - "Latest Documentation"

## Suggestions
Please update these links to ensure that the referenced documents render as expected. As a developer new to Celery, these missing documents create a significant gap in the learning process. Thank you in advance for your support and for maintaining this library. I look forward to exploring the capabilities of Celery and making the most of it.
