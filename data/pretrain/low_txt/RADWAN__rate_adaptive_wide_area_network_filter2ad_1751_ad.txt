### 5.3 Evaluating Modulation Change

We demonstrate the capability of RADWAN to react to Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) degradation by reducing the modulation format of ports, allowing links with reduced signal quality to function at lower rates. In this section, we provide an end-to-end evaluation of RADWAN as it attempts to meet changing demand matrices by upgrading the capacities of links in the WAN. Additionally, we show that RADWAN migrates flows from a link undergoing capacity up-/downgrade (due to improved/poor SNR) to alternate paths until the modulation change is complete.

### Link Capacity Downgrade

Figure 7(a) shows the initial state of our testbed where the network is carrying three 100 Gbps flows: two from Node C to D (C−D−1, C−D−2) and one from Node B to A (B−A−2). All links in the network can carry 200 Gbps of traffic. The Rx rate in Figure 7(d) matches the Tx rate, indicating no packet loss. We then attenuate the signal between Node A and B using a Variable Optical Attenuator (VOA) device, such that the switch ports can no longer sustain transmission at 200 Gbps. Consequently, the A−B link goes down (Figure 7(b)), causing the B−A−2 flow to be rerouted over the longer path B→C→D→A, which is configured as the backup route. This transition is visible in the utilization of links in the network (Figure 7(d)). Links B−C and D−A now carry 100 Gbps of the B−A−2 flow, resulting in 50% utilization. This leads to congestion on link C−D, which can only carry 200 Gbps of traffic, thus dropping 100 Gbps of traffic from the C−D flows.

The RADWAN controller mitigates this congestion by reducing the modulation format of the A−B link from 16QAM to QPSK. It takes approximately one minute for the modulation change to take effect, as observed in the down status of link A−B in Figure 7(d). Once the modulation change is complete, the A−B link is back up and carries the B−A−2 flow without any congestion (Tx/Rx rates match again). The new network state is shown in Figure 7(c). Therefore, our experiments show that RADWAN can react to traffic demands and signal quality by adapting the capacity of links in the WAN.

### 6. Large-Scale Evaluation

In Section 2, we used three years of SNR measurements to demonstrate that an overall capacity gain of 67% is possible by augmenting the capacity of links from 100 Gbps to 125, 150, 175, or 200 Gbps, depending on their average SNR. This represents the upper bound of the throughput gain achievable using RADWAN. The actual network throughput depends not only on the network state (link capacities, tunnels, etc.) but also on the traffic demand and acceptable churn (defined in Section 4).

In this section, we simulate the operation of RADWAN in a large backbone network with realistic traffic demands to compute the network throughput achieved by RADWAN. We compare the throughput and availability of the network under RADWAN and a state-of-the-art SWAN controller. Both controllers are aware of the underlying signal quality of links. However, unlike SWAN, RADWAN uses the SNR to update link capacities, choosing among discrete choices of 50, 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200 Gbps. As outlined in the previous section, RADWAN only upgrades the capacity of a link to meet increased traffic demand that cannot be met otherwise. Capacity downgrades are done to prevent link failures, ensuring that the lower-quality link can continue to function at a reduced rate.

### 6.1 Simulation Setup

We consider the network topology of a large commercial WAN and gather SNR measurements from the optical fiber connecting the nodes in the topology for four randomly chosen days in the years 2016 and 2017. Both RADWAN and SWAN compute flow allocations along various network paths to meet an elastic demand between each pair of nodes in the network.

Since WANs currently operate links at 100 Gbps, we consider the performance of SWAN in a fixed-capacity network where each link operates at 100 Gbps if the SNR is above the threshold for 100 Gbps modulation and is otherwise down. We refer to this scheme as SWAN-100. Operators can be more aggressive by operating links at a fixed but higher capacity of 150 Gbps, referred to as SWAN-150. While hardware limitations prevent hitless capacity changes presently, we simulate the performance of RADWAN under both hitless (RADWAN-HITLESS) and non-hitless (RADWAN) link capacity change behavior.

The traffic demand between each node pair varies periodically every two minutes (demand pattern shown in Figure 8(a)). Our choice of network demands is similar to previous work [15] since rapid changes in demand matrices stress-test the TE controllers. We also offset the traffic demand between each pair of nodes by a randomized value to ensure sufficient variety of demands in the network.

**Simulation Parameters:**
- The control loop of both controllers is executed every 30 seconds.
- We assume that the demand between each pair of nodes can be split across k = 2 shortest paths between the nodes.
- For RADWAN, we set the churn trade-off parameter ϵ (defined in Section 4) to a conservative value of 0.001.
- We perform several runs of this experiment, each lasting for one day. Across four randomly chosen days, our results are consistent. For brevity, the figures show results from one experimental run.

### 6.2 Evaluation Metrics

We focus on the following key aspects of effective, cost-efficient network design to evaluate RADWAN:

1. **Network Throughput:**
   - We compute the optimal network flow that RADWAN can achieve in each run of the controller and compare it with the optimal flow that SWAN achieves for the same network conditions. This provides the network throughput enabled by both controllers for each run of their control loops for the duration of a day. Figure 8(b) shows the network flow for both RADWAN and SWAN for two hours of a day (zoomed into two consecutive hours for better visibility). We observe that RADWAN manages to push 40% more traffic than SWAN-100 in the same network. This observation holds consistently with other hours and days we simulated.

2. **Link Throughput:**
   - We compare RADWAN and SWAN’s per-link throughput. For each run of the TE control loop, we compute the total traffic carried by each link and average it over all links in the network. Figure 8(c) shows the distribution of average link throughput over time (again zoomed over two hours for better visibility). On average, RADWAN increases the utilization of network links by 68% compared to SWAN-100, getting more utility from each link in the network.

3. **Link Availability:**
   - We compute the availability of links under each TE scheme as the fraction of total simulation time for which the link was up for carrying traffic. Figure 9(a) compares the average availability of links in the simulation period. As expected, RADWAN-HITLESS allows links to be 100% available since it instantly adapts the link capacity to the lower or higher SNR. RADWAN has slightly lower link availability since capacity changes are not hitless and cause the links undergoing capacity changes to be unavailable for roughly one minute. However, RADWAN provides better availability over the state-of-the-art SWAN-100 scheme. This is because RADWAN adapts links to lower capacities instead of failing them when the signal quality degrades. Even though capacity reconfigurations done by RADWAN are not hitless, the link availability under RADWAN does not suffer much since very few links undergo rapid changes in capacity (as seen in Figure 9b).

### 7. Discussion

In this section, we provide insights on future directions of hitless capacity change, as well as a discussion on cost and the impact of capacity change on the distances light can travel.

#### 7.1 Hitless Capacity Change

**BVTs and Dependency Graphs:**
Dependency graphs [19, 21] are one of the seminal techniques used for consistent network updates [9]. By specifying an old and a new network state, each individual routing change is performed only when safe to do so. However, when a link e is to be modulated, with a flow f utilizing e before and after the link flap, dependency graphs perform poorly: no alternative path is specified for f. RADWAN manages link flaps by computing an intermediate routing state for flows during reconfiguration. As such, RADWAN specifies a two-step dependency graph: in order for a scheduled link flap to be activated, the affected traffic is rerouted beforehand. Due to the benevolent nature of SNR in our three-year data set of 2,000 links, coupled with the churn minimization of Algorithm 1, RADWAN jointly activates all link flaps. In more volatile SNR scenarios, RADWAN can be set to activate link flaps over multiple dependent iterations. We conjecture that such intermediate consistency methods can eventually be phased out once hitless capacity changes become production-ready, as discussed in the next section.

**Towards Hitless Capacity Change:**
Bandwidth Variable Transceivers (BVTs) are not yet optimized to handle the latency of a modulation change. State-of-the-art BVTs can only change the link modulation after bringing the module to a lower power state, which translates to a link flap for higher-layer protocols. The duration of such link failures is a challenge in the deployment of dynamic capacity links in production networks. To quantify this, we obtained an evaluation board for the Acacia AC400 bandwidth variable transceiver [1]. This module is essentially the same as the one integrated in the switch linecard used as part of our testbed in Section 5. Since the evaluation board exposes an API to program the transceiver, we use it to understand the modulation change procedure. We changed the link’s modulation 200 times from QPSK to 16QAM and analyzed the time taken. Figure 10(b) shows the AC400 bandwidth variable transceiver module. We observe that the average downtime of the link undergoing capacity change is 68 seconds, similar to the results in the previous section. However, we demonstrate ways to change the modulation efficiently, such that it takes only 35 milliseconds, on average.
