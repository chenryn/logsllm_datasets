**ATT&CK ID:** S0356  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** KONNI

KONNI has been observed to duplicate the token of a high-integrity process in order to spawn an instance of `cmd.exe` under an impersonated user. This technique allows the malware to execute commands with elevated privileges, thereby evading detection and enhancing its capabilities. [6][7]
