# Poker Bots and Online Poker Security

## Poker Bots (Continued)
- **Crackdown on Bots**: Poker sites, such as Full Tilt and PokerStars, have been actively cracking down on the use of bots.
- **Detection Methods**:
  - **Betting Patterns**: Consistent and predictable betting behavior.
  - **Tendencies**: Unusual or repetitive play styles.
  - **Program Flaws**: Bots often exhibit consistent actions, such as always clicking the same pixel.
  - **Scanning**: Automated tools that scan for bot-like activity.

When a player is identified as a bot, the poker site will remove them from the games. Any winnings are confiscated, and the company may provide compensation to affected players when appropriate.

### Example: Full Tilt
- **Banned for Bot Use**: On October 16, 2010, a player was banned from Full Tilt Poker for using the Shanky Technologies Bot.
- **Security Notice**:
  - The player was found guilty of violating the rules regarding the use of prohibited software.
  - The decision was based on an extensive review of the player's account activity.
  - The player was warned not to attempt to play on Full Tilt Poker in the future, under penalty of account suspension and forfeiture of funds.

## Online Poker Network Architecture
- **Overview**: This section provides an in-depth look at the architecture of online poker networks, including the security measures and potential vulnerabilities.

## Poker Client and Privacy Concerns
- **Poker Client and Root Kits**: While the poker client is not a root kit, it exhibits similar characteristics, such as monitoring and scanning the user's system.
- **Privacy Invasions**: The client scans for unauthorized programs, examines the system, and monitors user activity, which can be seen as an invasion of privacy.

### Behind the Scenes: Poker Client Activities
- **Function Calls**:
  - `EnemyWindowNames()`
  - `EnemyProcessNames()`
  - `EnemyProcessHashs()`
  - `EnemyDLLNames()`
  - `EnemyURLs()`
- **System Monitoring**:
  - Scans the Windows process table.
  - Reads window text and handles.
  - Detects mouse movements to distinguish between human and automated activity.
- **Additional Functionality**:
  - Scans for known bot software.
  - Monitors table conversation and session duration.
  - Checks Internet cache and URL history.
  - Creates cookies and digital certificates.

### Cake Poker Client
- **Processes**:
  - `CakePoker.exe`
  - `PokerClient.exe`
  - `CakeNotifier.exe`
- **Security Measures**:
  - Random interval scans to protect against modifications.
  - Obfuscation and encryption of executables.
  - Monitoring of file and registry activities.

## Web Application Vulnerabilities
- **Common Issues**:
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Both persistent and reflective XSS vulnerabilities.
  - **Unvalidated Redirects**: Potential for malicious redirects.
  - **Lack of Input Validation**: Minimal validation of user inputs.
  - **Expired SSL Certificates**: Although not a direct vulnerability, it raises concerns about the site's security practices.

## Authentication Vulnerabilities
- **Password Requirements**:
  - **Carbon**: 6-20 characters.
  - **Bodog**: At least 5 characters.
  - **Cake**: 8-14 characters, including lowercase, uppercase, number, and special character.
  - **Full Tilt**: At least 5 characters.
  - **UB/Absolute**: At least 6 characters.
- **Brute-Force Attacks**:
  - Weak password requirements and lack of account lockout mechanisms make brute-force attacks feasible.
  - Tools like Hydra and Brutus can be used to exploit these weaknesses.

## Supporting Infrastructure
- **Businesses Supporting Poker Sites**:
  - **Training Sites**: Cardrunners, Deuces Cracked.
  - **Tracking Sites**: PTR, Sharkscope.
  - **Media/Forums**: Two+Two.
- **Potential Risks**:
  - These sites could be leveraged to gain information or launch phishing attacks to install malicious software.

## Defenses
### Application-Level Defenses
- **Multifactor Authentication**: Move away from password-based authentication.
- **Account Lockout**: Implement account lockout policies.
- **Security Testing**: Perform robust security testing and configuration management.
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Allow connections only from specific geographic locations.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to security standards such as ISO, PCI, and FISMA.

### User-Level Defenses
- **Dedicated VM**: Use a dedicated virtual machine for poker.
- **Antivirus/Spyware**: Use up-to-date antivirus and spyware protection.
- **Secure Networks**: Avoid playing on insecure wireless networks.
- **Strong Passwords**: Use strong, complex passwords and multifactor authentication where available.
- **Unique Passwords**: Do not use the same password across multiple sites.
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Monitor your network traffic for suspicious activity.

## Next Steps in Research
- **Deep Dive into Poker Clients**: Further investigation into the poker client's inner workings.
- **Custom Client Development**: Develop custom clients to bypass restrictions.
- **Automated Brute-Force Tools**: Create tools to brute-force poker passwords.
- **Network Mapping**: Map out poker networks in more detail.
- **Web Application Vulnerabilities**: Conduct an in-depth analysis of web application vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion
- **Findings**: Preliminary research has identified several areas that require strengthening.
- **Regulation and Compliance**: There is a need for regulation and compliance to ensure the security of gaming networks.
- **Personal Safety**: The researcher expresses uncertainty about the safety of playing online poker.

## Questions
- **Open Floor**: Any questions or further discussion points?
