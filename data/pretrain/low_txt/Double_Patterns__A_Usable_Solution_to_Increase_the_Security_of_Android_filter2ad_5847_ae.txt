### Summary of Findings on DPatt Authentication

**Top Reasons for Choosing DPatt:**
According to Table 10 in the Appendix, the top three reasons participants chose to use Double Patterns (DPatts) as their authentication method are:
1. **Memorability**: The chosen pattern is easy to remember.
2. **Interface Appeal**: Participants liked the new interface.
3. **Perceived Security**: Participants believed that DPatts are secure.

**Memorability and Selection Strategy:**
The primary reason for choosing DPatts is memorability. This aligns with our findings from a 25% sub-sample, where over half of the participants reported making their DPatt memorable as part of their selection strategy. 

**Visual Aspects of DPatts:**
Table 4 provides visual representations of the most frequently chosen DPatts in our survey. Additionally, Table 9 shows that approximately 60% of the sub-sample used visual aspects of DPatts in their selection strategy. This table also includes participants' post-selection reflections on their creation strategy, self-evaluation of their DPatt's security, and the difficulty they experienced in choosing their DPatt.

### Usability and Security of DPatts

**Usability Metrics:**
- **Setup/Recall Time**: Table 7 details the average setup and recall times for DPatts across different treatments. For example, the total setup time for the control group was 25.41 seconds (with a standard deviation of 14.57 seconds), and the recall time was 4.74 seconds (with a standard deviation of 2.80 seconds).
- **SUS Scores**: Table 8 presents the Simple Usability Scale (SUS) scores. The combined SUS score for all participants was 73.21, indicating strong usability.

**Security Enhancements:**
- **Increased Security**: Our results indicate that DPatts significantly enhance security compared to traditional Android patterns. A simulated attacker would only guess 5.3% of DPatts after 30 attempts, compared to 23.6% of Android patterns.
- **Blocklisting**: Blocklisting further improves security, with only 1.9% and 0.9% of DPatts being guessed in the first-pattern blocklist and full DPatt blocklist, respectively.

**User Perception and Adoption:**
- **High Memorability**: Participants recalled their DPatts at high rates (> 94%) even in a short-term study.
- **Positive Feedback**: Current Android pattern users rated DPatts highly in terms of usability and security. Many participants expressed excitement about the potential implementation of DPatts, viewing them as a natural extension of their preferred graphical password method.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed Double Patterns (DPatts) as an extension to Android patterns, where users enter two patterns in sequence and superimposed for authentication. Our online survey with 634 participants across three treatments (control, first pattern blocklist, and full DPatt blocklist) demonstrated that DPatts significantly increase security while maintaining or slightly degrading usability. The high memorability, positive user perceptions, and strong security metrics suggest that DPatts would be well-received as a natural and secure extension to existing Android patterns.
