### Botnet Bandwidth Analysis

**Botnet 1:**
- Sampled: 7,326 out of approximately 50,000
- **Bandwidth Metrics (Average and Standard Deviation):**
  - **Max Bandwidth:** 28.2356 (11.9612)
  - **Usage Bandwidth:**
    - Low: 19.2395 (8.5739)
    - Medium: 74.3089 (34.4838)
    - High: 364.8714 (636.2601)
  - **Available Bandwidth:**
    - Low: 8.9961
    - Medium: 44.8619
    - High: 236.8444

**Botnet 2:**
- Sampled: 3,380 out of 48,000
- **Bandwidth Metrics (Average and Standard Deviation):**
  - **Max Bandwidth:** 33.9266 (9.3649)
  - **Usage Bandwidth:**
    - Low: 27.9144 (8.8397)
    - Medium: 86.2721 (33.3334)
    - High: 280.6805 (229.9276)
  - **Available Bandwidth:**
    - Low: 6.0122
    - Medium: 29.7315
    - High: 151.7379

**Figure 5: Estimation of Bandwidth Usage in Two Sampled Botnets**

By examining the maximum bandwidth, both botnets appear to have a similar distribution of high, medium, and low-speed bots, suggesting they pose a comparable DDoS threat potential. However, diurnal changes significantly reduce the average available bandwidth in Botnet 2 compared to Botnet 1.

### Taxonomy and Metrics for Botnet Analysis

Researchers have systematically studied the botnet problem. Barford and Yegneswaran [8] analyzed four widely-used IRC botnet codebases, categorizing them across seven dimensions, including control mechanisms, propagation, and obfuscation. Trend Micro [35] proposed a taxonomy of botnet threats based on various aspects such as attacking behavior, command and control model, and evasion techniques. Our taxonomy differs by focusing on the structure and utility metrics of botnets, providing a use-driven approach.

### Detection and Response

Our taxonomy and general response options assume a sensitive detection system. We have not considered botnet detection, but we encourage further research in this area. Preliminary work includes tracking individual bots [22, 11] and countering botnets using honeypots and broad sensors [13, 17]. Recent studies include BotHunter [20], which uses IDS-Driven Dialog Correlation, and Rishi [18], which detects botnet channels through nickname similarity. Karasaridis et al. [28] proposed detecting botnet command and control through passive network flow analysis.

### Conclusion

Botnets present significant challenges for researchers. The dynamic nature of this problem requires anticipating future botnet strategies and designing effective response techniques. We propose key metrics to measure botnet utility and present a taxonomy based on topological structure. Our analysis shows that random network models (Erdős-Rényi or P2P systems) provide considerable resilience, resisting both random and targeted responses. Targeted removals on scale-free botnets offer the best response.

We demonstrated the utility of our taxonomy and metrics through simulations and real-world botnet experiments, including novel measurements of a P2P botnet. Future work will refine these metrics, explore more accurate estimation techniques, and identify metrics for measuring detection difficulties and evasive potential.
