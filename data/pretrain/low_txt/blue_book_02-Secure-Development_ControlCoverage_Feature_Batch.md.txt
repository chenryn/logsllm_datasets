## IMPORTANT: DevOps Kit (AzSK) is being sunset by the end of FY21. For more details, please refer to the [AzSK Sunset Notice](../../../ReleaseNotes/AzSKSunsetNotice.md).

### Batch Account Security Controls and Rationale

| **Control** | **Description & Rationale** | **Severity** | **Automated Fix Script** |
|-------------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | All users and identities must be granted the minimum required permissions using RBAC. This ensures that users have just enough permissions to perform their tasks, minimizing the exposure of resources in case of a user or service account compromise. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Storage Service Encryption (SSE)** | The Storage Account linked with the Batch account must be protected using SSE. This ensures that sensitive data is stored encrypted at rest, minimizing the risk of data loss from physical theft and helping meet regulatory compliance requirements. | High | Yes | No |
| **Secrets Protection on Compute Nodes** | Secrets associated with tasks must be protected on Batch service compute nodes. Encrypting sensitive data like secrets/keys minimizes exposure until runtime. Using uploaded certificates, compute nodes can decrypt the secrets as needed at runtime. | High | No | No |
| **Periodic Key Rotation** | Batch account access keys must be rotated periodically. This is a good security practice as it minimizes the likelihood of data loss or compromise due to key theft, brute forcing, or recovery attacks over time. | Medium | No | No |
| **Disable Remote Desktop Connection** | Remote desktop connections should be disabled on Batch account compute nodes. Open RDP/remote management connections expose a VM/compute node to a high level of risk from internet-based attacks that attempt to brute force credentials to gain access to the machine. | High | No | No |
| **Persist Output to Azure Blob Storage** | Batch account tasks and jobs should be configured to persist output to an Azure Blob Storage account. This is important because the Batch service works on compute nodes, and storing data in an SSE-enabled storage account helps prevent data loss in case of a compute node crash. | Medium | No | No |
| **Diagnostics Logs Retention** | Diagnostics logs must be enabled with a retention period of at least 365 days. Logs should be retained for a long enough period to recreate activity trails when investigations are required in the event of an incident or compromise. A 1-year retention period is typical for several compliance requirements. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Metric Alert Rules** | Metric alert rules must be configured on the Batch account. Enabling metric alerts allows you to receive notifications when a metric crosses a certain threshold, which can impact the performance of the batch resource. | Low | Yes | No |

This table provides a clear and structured overview of the security controls and their rationale, along with the severity and whether an automated fix script is available.
