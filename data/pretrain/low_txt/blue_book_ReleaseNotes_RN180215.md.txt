## 180215 (v.2.10.*)

### Feature Updates

* **DevOps Kit Configuration Checks:**
  * We have introduced a [set of controls](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs/blob/master/02-Secure-Development/ControlCoverage/Feature/AzSKCfg.md) that will validate the DevOps Kit setup and configuration for a given subscription as part of scans. These controls proactively inform users about issues such as:
    - Broken CA setups
    - Outdated versions of the DevOps Kit module
    - Old CA runbooks
  * The results from these 'DevOps Kit health' controls will also be sent to OMS.

* **Activity Alert Monitoring:**
  * Added central visibility to activity log alerts, which provides telemetry on how frequently alerts are triggered across subscriptions and helps in enriching them.
  * Introduced the capability to register for receiving [SMS alerts for role assignment changes](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs/blob/master/01-Subscription-Security/Readme.md#configure-alerts-for-your-subscription).

* **OMS:**
  * [Enhanced the OMS solution queries](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs/blob/master/05-Alerting-and-Monitoring/Readme.md#guide-to-azsk-oms-solution-queries) by leveraging richer metadata sent to OMS.

### Other Improvements and Bug Fixes

* **AzureRm 5.2:**
  * Migrated the DevOps Kit to use AzureRm 5.2.0 instead of AzureRm 4.1.0. This update will be automatically installed as part of the upgrade process in all scenarios (SDL, CICD, CA).

* **Renaming AzSDK -> AzSK:**
  * Republished the CICD release extension with the updated module name. Additional internal work is in progress to complete the overall renaming effort.

* **Controls:**
  * **Function Apps:** Fixed HTTPS/AuthN controls to apply only if the trigger is set to HTTPS.
  * **Cloud Service:** Resolved a control issue when the cloud service has no configuration settings.
  * Addressed other issues observed through errors and exceptions via our telemetry.

* **Continuous Assurance (CA):**
  * Simplified the experience for CA SPN certificate renewal by adding a `'-RenewCertificate'` switch in the `Update-CA` command. For more details, see [Updating an Existing Continuous Assurance Setup](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs/tree/master/04-Continous-Assurance#updating-an-existing-continuous-assurance-setup).
  * Added more diagnostic information to help troubleshoot runbook issues.
  * Local scans will now respect the `AltOMSworkspace` setting.

* **CICD:**
  * Updated the CICD release extension to use the latest VSTS Task SDK.
