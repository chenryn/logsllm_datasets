### Metabolic Network Analysis and Drought Resistance

Metabolic network analysis has enabled the identification of key metabolic 'hubs' that characterize the observed metabolic reprogramming. These changes are associated with enhanced drought resistance traits. Our findings suggest that selected Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPRs) act as priming agents, enhancing plant resistance to abiotic stresses. This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the PGPR-related defense priming phenomenon, which could play a significant role in alleviating drought stress in plants. This, in turn, provides sustainable and economically favorable solutions to improve agricultural practices and crop productivity.

**Title: A Strategy for the Discovery and Characterization of Health and Decline Biomarkers in British Oak Trees Using Non-Targeted Metabolomics**

**Presenting Author: Jasen Finch, Aberystwyth University, United Kingdom**
**Co-Authors: Manfred Beckmann, Sandra Denman, John Draper**

Decline syndromes in British Oak trees are becoming increasingly prevalent across the UK due to climate change. These syndromes exhibit a multitude of complex disease phenotypes, influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors over multiple growing seasons. We have developed a minimally destructive method for reproducibly sampling the metabolome content of living cell types in woody tissues, allowing samples to be collected from trees at various sites across the UK. Trees have been extensively phenotyped for attributes such as canopy condition, tree size, and the presence of biotic agents. This phenotypic data has led to the development of a novel "tree health index" that describes trees along a continuous decline spectrum. Sampled woody tissues were analyzed using untargeted flow infusion electrospray ionisation high-resolution mass spectrometry (FIE-HRMS), normal and reverse phase liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to provide comprehensive metabolome coverage. Using the machine learning algorithm random forest, we integrated metabolome features with the tree health indexes, revealing strong associations with several explanatory metabolites, including amino acids involved in nitrogen metabolism and transport. These markers have been shown to be robust over two growing seasons and can accurately predict decline status in an independent set of trees. These identified markers have the potential to serve as future diagnostic tools for monitoring health status and as predictive tools for long-term management strategies for oak decline.

**Title: Linking the Volatilome and Metabolome via Plant Defenses: Stimulation of the Salicylic Acid Pathway Recruits Natural Enemies Below Ground**

**Presenting Author: Camila Filgueiras, Cornell University, United States**
**Co-Author: Denis S. Willett**

The metabolome and volatilome can be considered linked, overlapping sets. Traditionally, studies have examined each in isolation, implicitly understanding that one influences the other. In plant-insect interactions, this understanding is becoming more explicit. Here, we show that exogenous aboveground stimulation of the salicylic acid pathway induces the release of volatiles by plant roots, which recruit entomopathogenic nematode natural enemies below ground. This is one of the first examples of aboveground effects propagating below ground and highlights the role of the salicylic acid pathway in mediating secondary plant defenses through volatile recruitment of natural enemies. Understanding the relationship between internal plant defense metabolites and volatiles released by plants that recruit natural enemies enhances our knowledge of the connection between the metabolome and volatilome and improves our ability to control pests in the field.

**Title: Is Metabolomics Ready for the Return of Artificial Neural Networks?**

**Presenting Author: David Broadhurst, Edith Cowan University, Australia**

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were first applied to metabolomics data in the late 1990s, spearheaded by Kell and Goodacre at Aberystwyth University. My PhD, published in 1998, was titled 'Genetic Algorithms, Artificial Neural Networks, and Their Application to Chemometrics.' Although ANNs proved effective for modeling metabolomics data, they were generally perceived as a 'black box' and too difficult to interpret. By the early 2000s, the popularity of ANNs had declined, with partial least squares regression becoming the dominant method for analyzing multivariate metabolite data. Over the last five years, there has been a resurgence in the use of ANNs, particularly in image analysis and biomarker discovery in systems biology. In this presentation, I will outline the current and future challenges in applying ANNs to metabolomics, given the changing landscape of acceptance and increased computational resources. For AI techniques to be adopted without cynicism, all code and applications must be open, transparent, and subject to detailed scrutiny. I will introduce the use of experiential learning through open-source Jupyter Notebooks, operating via cloud computing resources such as Binder and Microsoft Azure.

**Title: MS-DIAL 4.0: A Computational Workflow for Ion Mobility Tandem Mass Spectrometry Data in Metabolomics**

**Presenting Author: Hiroshi Tsugawa, RIKEN, Japan**
**Co-Authors: Yoshifumi Mori, Yasuhiro Higashi, Aya Satoh, Sven Meyer, Kazuki Saito, Masanori Arita**

Ion mobility mass spectrometry provides robust physicochemical measurements, such as collision cross-section (CCS), of metabolites by increasing peak capacities in the mobility dimension. While this significantly improves metabolite identification in terms of accuracy and coverage, few programs can handle its raw data for peak picking, metabolite annotation, peak alignment, and statistical analysis. We present a new software program, MS-DIAL 4.0, for data-dependent MS/MS acquisition in liquid chromatography coupled with ion mobility tandem mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS/MS). The program facilitates metabolite annotation by integrating five-dimensional (5D) physicochemical properties: ion abundance, retention time (RT), CCS, m/z, and MS/MS spectrum. Additionally, we have developed an enriched mass spectral database for lipidomics, containing 5D properties for over 200,000 molecules across 90 lipid classes. We demonstrate our workflow in plant lipidomics, where the metabolic changes under heat stress are captured using 5D diagnostic criteria.

**Title: Chemically Informed Distance Metrics for Tandem Mass Spectrometry Data**

**Presenting Author: Madeleine Ernst, Department of Congenital Disorders, Statens Serum Institut, Denmark**
**Co-Authors: Justin J.J. van der Hooft, Kyo Bin Kang, Asker Brejnrod, Louis-Félix Nothias, Ricardo R. da Silva, Pieter C. Dorrestein**

Untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics is widely used to evaluate differences and similarities in metabolite profiles across various applications and sample types. Pairwise dissimilarities across samples are often summarized using distance metrics followed by multivariate statistics such as principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). However, conventional distance metrics ignore the chemical structural relatedness between molecules. Thus, even if two samples contain chemically similar yet distinct molecules, they would be regarded as very different. We propose two chemically informed distance metrics inspired by the UniFrac metric, which compares microbial communities by incorporating phylogenetic relatedness. Similarly, molecules are related to each other through shared biosynthetic pathways and chemical substructures. We implement two versions of calculating chemical relatedness: one based on shared chemical class annotations and one based on shared substructure patterns. Using datasets from diverse sources, we show how these metrics can improve multivariate statistics and subsequent data interpretation. For example, in the cosmopolitan plant family Rhamnaceae, we observe high chemical dissimilarity across two phylogenetic clades producing chemically very distantly related compounds, such as flavonoids and terpenoids, a trend that could not be revealed using conventional methods. We expect that the proposed chemically-informed distance metrics will be of great benefit to any metabolomics fields studying complex mixtures.

**Title: Identifying Biologically Relevant Modules in Metabolomics and Lipidomics Data with Differential Network-Based Enrichment Analysis (DNEA)**

**Presenting Author: Alla Karnovsky, University of Michigan, United States**
**Co-Authors: Gayatri Iyer, Janis Wigginton, William Duren, Marci Brandenburg, George Michailidis**

Metabolomics and lipidomics datasets are becoming increasingly large and complex, requiring powerful statistical and bioinformatics tools. A well-established approach to linking alterations in metabolite levels to specific biological processes is to map experimentally measured metabolites to known biochemical pathways and identify significantly enriched pathways. However, traditional enrichment analysis techniques have limited utility for untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics data. We developed an alternative approach, Differential Network Enrichment Analysis (DNEA), which extracts meaningful associations between metabolites/lipids directly from the experimental data. DNEA uses joint structural sparsity estimation to build partial correlation networks, performs consensus clustering to identify highly connected subnetworks, and uses Network-based Gene Set Analysis (NetGSA) to identify differentially enriched subnetworks. We have extended the method to improve its versatility in situations such as unbalanced designs and low sample sizes relative to the number of features. The program is implemented in Java as a client-server application with a GUI. The input is a comma-separated file with metabolite measurements and information about experimental groups. The output contains a list of enriched subnetworks ranked by significance, which can be viewed as an HTML file or exported into a network visualization software like Cytoscape. We tested DNEA in several publicly available metabolomics and lipidomics datasets from various diseases and demonstrated that it can identify alterations in both network structure and expression levels of interacting biomolecules that impact disease phenotypes.

**Title: Signature Mapping (SigMa): A New Automatic Tool for Rapid Processing of Complex Urine NMR Spectra**

**Presenting Author: Bekzod Khakimov, University of Copenhagen, Denmark**
**Co-Authors: Nabiollah Mobaraki, Alessia Trimigno, Violetta Aru, Søren Balling Engelsen**

1D 1H NMR analysis of urine generates rich but complex data. Retrieving metabolite information from complex NMR spectra is challenging due to signal overlapping and chemical shift changes. This study introduces a new method, Signature Mapping (SigMa), for the identification and quantification of signature signals (SS) and rapid conversion of complex human urine NMR spectra into an informative metabolite table. SigMa compiles advanced multivariate data analysis algorithms for NMR data alignment, baseline correction, peak finding, and peak deconvolution into user-friendly software. The method utilizes experimental data on unique chemical shift ranges of 166 SS representing 100 urine metabolites, enabling unambiguous metabolite identification in thousands of spectra simultaneously. An automatic peak finding option in SigMa allows detection of spectral regions (SR) of any unknown spin systems and complex regions representing overlapped signals of several metabolites, making it suitable for targeted and untargeted metabolomics. SigMa applies individual MCR modeling for relative quantification of each SS, while complex SR are quantified using a binning approach. The performance of SigMa was evaluated using three NMR datasets and proved to be more efficient than the most commonly used binning approach. Processing 40 spectra from seven healthy individuals using SigMa showed an increase in between-individual variation while decreasing within-individual variation. SigMa also depicted the highest quantification accuracy and reproducibility of urine metabolites in large datasets containing several thousand human urine NMR spectra.

**Title: Spatial Metabolomics in Tissues and Single Cells**

**Presenting Author: Theodore Alexandrov, EMBL, Germany**

Metabolites, lipids, and other small molecules exhibit complex and cell-specific spatial localization in tissues, supporting tissue homeostasis in health and metabolism reprogramming in disease. Our team develops novel tools for spatial metabolomics to detect and interpret the roles of these molecules in tissues and single cells. I will present a recently developed cloud platform, METASPACE, for spatial metabolomics in tissues, which provides a comprehensive, community-populated resource for metabolism research and spatial systems biology. I will also present a spatial single-cell metabolomics method that, by correlative in situ imaging of cell monolayers, provides the metabolic profile and assesses the optical, morphological, and fluorescent phenotype for each cell. These tools open new avenues for understanding metabolism in tissues and at the single-cell level.

**Title: Comprehensive Single Cell Multi-Omics**

**Presenting Author: Christian Berchtold, Institute for Chemistry and Bioanalytics, Switzerland**
**Co-Authors: Luca Rima, Stefan Arnold, Götz Schlotterbeck, Thomas Braun**

Combining various analytical methods is crucial for the future of biochemical investigations. Analyzing metabolites and proteins from the same sample, especially from the same cell, can provide fundamental insights into cellular processes. A recently developed single-cell picker allows the sampling and lysis of individual cells, enabling the selection of cells based on phenotypical appearance. In this proof-of-concept study, we used this system to deposit the lysate from one or a few cells on dedicated slides. Using a modified CAMAG TLC-MS interface, the cell lysate was transferred into a standard LC-MS system, including chromatographic separation. Highly abundant metabolites such as glutamine or glutamic acid were detected at the single-cell level. Proteins remained on the microscope slide and were detected by antibody staining after LC-MS analysis of the same cell. We demonstrated a strategy to combine several techniques to detect metabolites and proteins from the same sample. However, the concept needs further optimization for sensitivity, robustness, and speed for quantitative high-throughput measurements.

**Title: Quantifying Heterogeneity in Drug Uptake, Metabolism, and Effect Using Raman Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry on the Single-Cell Level**

**Presenting Author: Ahmed Ali, Leiden University, The Netherlands | RIKEN, Japan**
**Co-Authors: Yasmine Abouleila, Arno Germond, Mashaghi Tabari A, Thomas Hankemeier, Toshio Yanagida**

Monitoring drug uptake, metabolism, and response on the single-cell level has been extremely challenging in the drug discovery field. In this study, we show the potential of label-free single-cell analysis in drug discovery by utilizing a bi-modal analytical platform that combines Raman spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor the effect of tamoxifen on single cells treated with the drug in a high-throughput and non-invasive manner. The same cells were then sampled and analyzed by mass spectrometry, measuring the concentration of the drug and its metabolite, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OHT), in each cell. MS measurements revealed strong heterogeneity in the drug concentration across single cells, even more pronounced for its metabolite. Despite this, the concentrations of both the drug and its metabolite correlated positively, confirming drug uptake and metabolism in the cell. Raman spectroscopy not only detected the cellular metabolic changes caused by the drug but also predicted whether a given cell was affected by the drug with 97% accuracy using a PLS-DA model. We successfully correlated the drug effect (measured by Raman spectroscopy) and the concentration of the drug or its metabolite (measured by MS) on the single-cell level. The Raman peaks used in this correlation can serve as biomarkers for drug activity in the cell. Our integrated Raman-MS platform proves to be a powerful tool that can aid future drug discovery efforts.

**Title: Relationships Between Cellular Metabolite and Drug Uptake and Transporter Expression Profiles**

**Presenting Author: Marina Muelas, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom**
**Co-Authors: Farah Mughal, Steve O’Hagan, Philip J. Day, Douglas B. Kell**

It is widely but erroneously believed that drugs enter cells by passing through the phospholipid bilayer of the plasma and other membranes. Evidence shows that drugs cross biomembranes by hitchhiking on transporters for other natural molecules to which these drugs are structurally similar. We present untargeted metabolomics time course analyses of the uptake and secretion of metabolites in human serum by several human cell lines. We show how distinct the metabolic footprints of different cell lines are from one another. We subsequently compare the transcriptomes (by RT-qPCR or using published RNA-Seq datasets) and published proteomic expression profiles of cell lines with the uptake of substances (by LC-MS/MS). By employing mathematical methods, we infer the variations in SLC and ABC membrane transporter expression to best explain the variation in metabolite uptake and the relationship to the function of the tissues from which these cell lines are derived. This analysis will also produce quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict and test transporters responsible for the uptake and secretion of pharmaceutical drugs. We also utilize the Gini index (coefficient) as a novel means of characterizing the variation in individual transporter distributions between these cell lines. Our results show that many transporters exhibit extremely high Gini coefficients, indicating a much higher degree of specialization than is usually assumed.

**Title: A Single-Cell Look at Biological Nitrogen Fixation: Direct Determination of Metabolite Formulas from Isotopic Fine Structures in Heterogeneous Cell Populations**

**Presenting Author: Tina Tran, The George Washington University, United States**
**Co-Authors: Laith Z. Samarah, Rikkita Khattar, Sylwia A. Stopka, Christine A. Brantner, Paola Parlanti, Dušan Veličković, Jared B. Shaw, Beverly J. Agtuca, David W. Koppenaal, Christopher R. Anderton, Nikola Tolić, Gary Stacey, Ljiljana Paša-Tolić, Akos Vertes**

Many legumes, like soybean, do not depend on synthetic fertilizers for nitrogen uptake. Instead, they form mutualistic relationships with bacteria capable of biological nitrogen fixation. Specialized plant organs, such as root nodules, are created from these interactions, where bacteria-infected plant cells are intimately mixed with uninfected cells. Exploring the metabolic profiles of these heterogeneous systems requires single-cell analysis techniques. Here, we present the combination of fiber-based laser ablation electrospray ionization (f-LAESI) with 21 Tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (21T FTICR-MS) for the direct analysis of single cells. Direct determination of metabolite formulas from isotopic fine structures (IFS) was attained from our single-cell data. Over 100 compounds were tentatively assigned based on ultra-high mass accuracy, and elemental formulas for 47 of these were verified by IFS. Comparing the calculated IFS patterns for possible metabolite ions with the experimental data enabled the identification of close-to-isobaric compounds with different elemental compositions. Infected cells showed higher abundances of nitrogen-containing compounds and lipids compared to uninfected cells. Compositional heterogeneity among infected cells was observed by determining the metabolic noise (η²). Within a population of 124 infected cells, several primary metabolites essential for cellular growth and maintenance, and plant-specific secondary metabolites, exhibited relatively low η² (≤ 0.50). Conversely, lipids associated with plant and bacteroid membranes showed greater noise levels (η² ≥ 0.50), indicating larger variance in their amounts. Metabolic noise measurements can provide insight into how tightly metabolite levels are regulated and how this relates to their biological function.
