### Apache Airflow Version
2.4.0

### Issue Description
In our Airflow 2.4.0 instance, we have two scheduled DAGs: a weekly report (scheduled to run at `17 10 * * 1`) and a monthly report (scheduled to run at `30 0 9 * *`). The schedules for these DAGs have not been modified, and they are defined in Python files that also contain other daily DAGs. I have tested by isolating the weekly DAG into its own file, but it still does not run as scheduled.

**Observations:**
- Neither the weekly nor the monthly DAGs execute as expected.
- As of today (2022-10-11), the weekly DAG still shows the next run time as `2022-10-10, 10:17:00`.
- The monthly DAG, which should have run on the 9th, has rescheduled its next execution to the following month. This rescheduling occurred exactly 24 hours after the scheduled runtime.

```

### Expected Behavior
The DAGs should execute according to their defined schedules.

### Steps to Reproduce
Our Airflow distribution is managed in a Git repository and can be easily deployed as temporary development servers. I have confirmed that this issue is reproducible in duplicate deployments, indicating that it is not specific to our instance.

### Operating System
Ubuntu 22.04 running on AWS
