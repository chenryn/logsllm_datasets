### Distinctive Features of BAAT

Another distinctive feature of BAAT is its capability to plan the battery aging rate for better utilization of energy storage resources. Typically, the lifespan of a lead-acid battery ranges from 3 to 10 years [43], while that of a data center is between 10 and 15 years [44]. Without proper aging planning, it is highly likely that data center operators will have to discard recently replaced batteries before they reach their full potential lifespan.

BAAT can adjust the Depth of Discharge (DoD) to modulate the battery's service life, synchronizing it with the end-of-life of the data center infrastructure. This synchronization maximizes performance benefits. As shown in Figure 21, the performance improvement is not linear with DoD variation. For example, when the DoD increases from 40% to 60%, the performance improvement is more noticeable than when it increases from 70% to 90%. This is because, compared to a normal DoD range of 20-40%, the latter leads to a lower State of Charge (SoC), which reduces the battery's lifetime.

We consider different durations of the expected battery service life, from the installation time of the battery to the end-of-life of the data center. By aggressively utilizing the battery, data center productivity can be improved by up to 33% (Figure 22) compared to e-Buff. Our results show that the performance benefits decrease when the newly replaced battery is close to the data center/server end-of-life. This is due to an upper bound on battery discharge (i.e., over 90% DoD), which restricts the performance improvement. On the other hand, the benefits of aging planning also decrease if the battery installation time is far from the expected data center end-of-life, as the unused portion of the batteryâ€™s lifetime that can be shifted is too small.

### Related Work

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive analysis of battery aging and failure in green data centers. The relevant prior work is summarized below:

**Studies of Battery Aging and Battery Lifetime:**
There have been numerous studies on battery aging and lifetime, which can be categorized into:
1. **Battery System Model and Evaluation [14, 15]:** These studies focus on using mathematical formulas to model battery behavior.
2. **Battery Aging Mechanism Studies [16, 17]:** [16] provides an overview of lead-acid battery aging mechanisms, while [17] focuses on sulfation aging in batteries.
3. **Battery Lifetime Prediction Models [18, 19]:** To our knowledge, none of the prior work addresses battery aging issues at the data center level.

**Battery Management in Micro-Systems:**
As the primary power source in micro-systems, battery usage and lifetime management have been studied in mobile/embedded environments [45-48] and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) [49]. Prior work mainly focuses on battery-aware energy management and task scheduling. For example, [48] presents a stochastic model of battery and a framework for estimating battery lifetime in mobile embedded systems, while [49] formulates an optimal control problem to minimize fuel consumption and battery aging in HEV systems. Most of these works focus on single and micro system control, whereas our work explores the aging issues of battery systems in green data centers.

**Battery Provisioning in Data Centers:**
Deploying batteries as energy buffers in data centers to reduce power costs and improve power quality has received increasing attention. Recent proposals investigate battery provisioning and management in both conventional [6, 7, 10, 11, 50] and emerging renewable energy-powered data centers [4, 5, 12, 13, 51, 52]. Among these, [6, 7, 10, 11] primarily emphasize battery provisioning (e.g., centralized, distributed, or hierarchical usage manner) to aggressively leverage the battery to shave peak power demands and store energy during low load periods. These studies rarely manage battery aging dynamically. Similarly, while many recent studies [4] employ batteries to buffer renewable power in data centers, there has been no work that explores battery aging-aware power management in the context of green data centers.

Our work distinguishes itself from other studies in four key aspects:
1. It investigates emerging battery aging issues at the data center level.
2. It comprehensively analyzes battery aging mechanisms from the perspective of architecture and system designers (rather than an electrochemical point of view).
3. It proposes a novel battery aging management framework that can jointly balance, slow down, and plan the aging process.
4. It builds a real prototype to evaluate the benefit and efficiency of battery aging-aware power management schemes.

### Conclusions

In this study, we explore battery aging issues on a scaled-down prototype over six months and propose a novel power management framework to dynamically manage battery aging in emerging green data centers, where massive distributed battery systems are increasingly being deployed for power and energy management.

We introduce BAAT, a novel battery aging management framework that can jointly hide, slow down, and plan battery aging. It leverages quantified battery aging metrics abstracted from runtime performance statistics to efficiently handle battery aging at the computer architecture and system levels. We conduct detailed experiments on a real system prototype built from scratch. Our results show that BAAT can reduce the battery aging rate by 38% even in the worst case and can improve battery lifetime by 69% on average. Additionally, BAAT can reduce the performance overhead caused by inefficient battery management, thereby improving workload throughput by 28%. Our design allows data centers to reduce annual battery depreciation costs by 26%.
