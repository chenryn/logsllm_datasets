## Welcome from the Chairs

We are delighted to welcome you to the Third Workshop on Forming an Ecosystem Around Software Transformation (FEAST 2018)! This year’s workshop is held in conjunction with the 25th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) on October 19th, 2018, in Toronto, Canada.

As always, the workshop aims to foster discussions and a deeper understanding of software transformation techniques that can enhance the security and efficiency of software used in critical applications. The scope of this workshop includes topics that are essential for exploring the full potential and impact of late-stage software customization, particularly in binary code and beyond.

The call for papers attracted strong submissions from both academia and industry. We accepted five full technical papers and complemented them with a series of exciting invited talks, short presentations, and planned discussions.

Organizing FEAST'18 has been a collaborative effort, and we extend our gratitude to the authors for their excellent submissions, the program committee for their insightful reviews, and the Office of Naval Research for their support in establishing this workshop. We are enthusiastic about this event and are confident that you will find it equally engaging. Please enjoy the programs, discussions, and the exchange of new ideas!
