### Figure 14: Reception with USRP B210 of a GLONASS C/A Code Sent at 800.875 MHz Using an Innos D6000

The reception of a GLONASS C/A code at 800.875 MHz was performed using a USRP B210 and an Innos D6000. The intermediate frequency (FIF) was set to 875 kHz, corresponding to satellite \( k = -2 \). Future research could explore the direct injection of the 1.6 GHz harmonic into the GNSS receiver.

To ensure the validity of the lock at reception, we:
1. Avoided overfitting the lock/tracking parameters of the default configuration of the GNSS-SDR receiver.
2. Observed that the lock only occurred when the transmission was active.
3. Confirmed that the lock consistently corresponded to the expected satellite for different tuning frequencies.

### Potential Applications and Research Directions

#### Noise-SDR and Modulation Techniques
Noise-SDR can be used to modulate radio carriers intentionally emitted by the circuit, leveraging effects such as Screaming Channels [42], [43]. This approach can facilitate the development of Second-Order Soft-TEMPEST [40], [41]. For example, we successfully leveraged the carrier emitted by the Near Field Communication (NFC) reader of a Nokia 3.1 to transmit data using PSK31.

#### Phase Modulation and Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)
Phase modulation and DSSS open new avenues for research in localization (e.g., Doppler tracking of moving targets) and undetectable secret transmissions (below the noise floor with cryptographically secure spreading codes [128]).

#### Generalization and Leakage Control
Noise-SDR is a versatile approach that can be extended to other types of physical leakage. Leakage control can be achieved without explicit code execution. For instance, a website could download and display an image to control screen leakage, or memory accesses could be triggered through GPU-accelerated rendering in the browser [55] or by sending WiFi packets [129].

### Conclusion and Replicability

We have introduced Noise-SDR, a software-defined, fully-digital approach that provides a high degree of control over electromagnetic leakage. Despite some limitations in frequency and bandwidth, Noise-SDR achieves arbitrary modulation in amplitude, frequency, and phase. Similar to an SDR, Noise-SDR modulates a generic baseband signal generated in software on an electromagnetic leakage acting as a carrier. This makes theoretical and practical knowledge in radio communications readily available to potential attackers.

Noise-SDR has a significant impact on emission security for two main reasons:
1. Attackers can establish advanced communication channels previously thought unavailable to unprivileged software.
2. Attackers can use SDR tools to leverage existing high-performance radio protocols or design complex custom solutions without extensive knowledge or effort.

To ensure the replicability of our results, Noise-SDR is open source and available at: https://github.com/eurecom-s3/noise-sdr.
