## I. Introduction and Motivation

Over the past few years, aerial and ground vehicles, as well as mobile robot systems, have seen a significant increase in the number of electronic components. These components are often connected via wireless networks and run embedded software. This strong integration between the physical environment and networking forms a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). CPSs have become a common feature in everyday vehicles, such as automobiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

As processing power increases and software becomes more sophisticated, these vehicles can perform complex operations, becoming more autonomous, efficient, adaptable, comfortable, safe, and user-friendly. These advanced vehicles are known as Intelligent Vehicles (IVs).

UAVs now provide flexible support for various missions, enabling their deployment in scenarios where accessibility was previously difficult or impossible. They can connect to sensor networks capable of monitoring a wide range of applications. Automobiles offer features like active safety, adaptive cruise control, park assistance, automatic climate control, navigation support, and, in the near future, vehicle-to-vehicle communication. These systems are classified as critical, as failures can result in loss of human lives or high-value assets. Therefore, safety is a primary concern for developers and users.

However, the combination of high mobility and wireless communications has increased the exposure of these systems to malicious threats and faults from uncertain connectivity or communication timeliness. Non-functional requirements such as security and real-time operation have become more challenging to meet, creating new challenges for safety-critical embedded systems.

To make Intelligent Vehicles a reality, further research and development are necessary. This includes addressing the needs of multidisciplinary approaches such as integrated control systems, communication and network, security algorithms, artificial intelligence, verification and validation, neural networks, safety assets, and other technological concerns.

The goal of this workshop is to explore the challenges and innovative solutions regarding Intelligent Vehicles, particularly focusing on the implications of security and real-time issues on safety and certification. The workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from various communities, including dependability and security, real-time and embedded systems, intelligent transportation, and mobile robot systems.

## II. Scope and Topics

This workshop aims to explore the challenges and innovative solutions related to the security and safety of Intelligent Vehicles. Contributions will address topics such as:
- Architecture, design, implementation, and management of intelligent vehicles
- Functional safety, standards, and certification
- Security threats to cyber-physical systems
- Techniques and protocols for cooperative vehicles
- Data communication in networked embedded systems
- Aerial, ground, and aquatic mobile robotics
- Collision prediction and avoidance
- Advanced driver assistance systems
- Real-time perception and sensor fusion
- Real-time motion planning in dynamic environments
- Modeling and control of safety-critical mobile robots
- Practical experiences and testbeds related to intelligent vehicles
- Industrial experiences and best practices relevant to the safety and security of intelligent vehicles

## III. Paper Acceptance and Publication

Seventeen papers were submitted by researchers and practitioners from eight countries: Brazil, Sweden, United States of America, Germany, Austria, Djibouti, Italy, and Portugal. After a rigorous peer review process, nine papers (five full and four short) were accepted for presentation at the workshop. These papers will be published in the Dependable Systems and Networks Workshops (DSN-W) volume, available on IEEE Xplore. Further information is available at [www.lsec.icmc.usp.br/ssiv2015], which will be updated with the presented material after the workshop.

## IV. Special Issue

Selected papers from this workshop will be considered for a Special Issue on Safety and Security of Intelligent Vehicles in the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine. An open call will be issued, and submissions will undergo a separate peer review process. The IEEE ITS Magazine publishes peer-reviewed articles that provide innovative research ideas and application results, report significant application case studies, and raise awareness of pressing research and application challenges in all areas of intelligent transportation systems. This magazine is indexed by Thomson’s Journal Citation Reports (Web of Science) and Science Citation Index Expanded.
