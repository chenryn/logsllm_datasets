2. Click **Settings** (near the bottom of the window), then click **General** (near the top).
3. Enter the new computer name and click **Save**. The name should contain no more than 15 characters, no special characters, and no punctuation. If practical, make the server name match its unqualified DNS host name.
4. If the server is the PDC or a Windows domain member, authenticate by entering the name and password of a user account that can administer the LDAP directory domain on the PDC server.

#### From the Command Line
You can also change the server name using the `serveradmin` command in Terminal.

#### From the Command Line
You can also change WINS settings using the `serveradmin` command in Terminal.

## Solving Problems With Windows Services
This section provides solutions to common problems with Windows services.

### Problems With a Primary Domain Controller (PDC)
- **User Can’t Log in to the Windows Domain**:
  - Ensure the user account is configured to use Open Directory authentication.
  - Make sure the workstation has joined the PDC domain.
- **Windows User Has No Home Directory**:
  - Verify the correct home directory location on the **Home** pane of Workgroup Manager.
  - Check the home directory path on the **Windows** pane of Workgroup Manager.
  - Using Server Admin, connect to the server where the user’s home directory resides. Select **Windows** in the **Computers & Services** list, click **Advanced**, and ensure the **Enable virtual share points** setting is selected.
  - The drive letter chosen for the user may conflict with a drive letter already in use on the Windows workstation. Change either the drive letter setting on the **Windows** pane of Workgroup Manager or the mappings of other drive letters on the workstation.
- **Windows User’s Profile Settings Revert to Defaults**:
  - Verify the correct home directory location on the **Home** pane of Workgroup Manager.
  - Check the home directory path on the **Windows** pane of Workgroup Manager.
  - The drive letter chosen for the user may conflict with a drive letter already in use on the Windows workstation. Change either the drive letter setting on the **Windows** pane of Workgroup Manager or the mappings of other drive letters on the workstation.
- **Windows User Loses Contents of My Documents Folder**:
  - Verify the correct home directory location on the **Home** pane of Workgroup Manager.
  - Check the user profile path on the **Windows** pane of Workgroup Manager. The contents of **My Documents** are stored in the user profile.
  - The drive letter chosen for the user may conflict with a drive letter already in use on the Windows workstation. Change either the drive letter setting on the **Windows** pane of Workgroup Manager or the mappings of other drive letters on the workstation.

### Problems With Windows File Service
- **User Can’t Authenticate for Windows File Service**:
  - Ensure the user account is configured to use Open Directory authentication.
- **User Can’t See the Windows Server in the Network Neighborhood**:
  - Verify the user’s computer is properly configured for TCP/IP and has the appropriate Windows networking software installed.
  - Go to the DOS prompt on the client computer and type `ping <IP address>` where `<IP address>` is your server’s address. If the ping fails, there is a TCP/IP network problem.
  - If the user’s computer is on a different subnet from the server, ensure the **Enable WINS server** option is selected or the **Register with WINS server** option is selected and configured correctly.
  - On the Windows computer, choose **View > Refresh** to force Windows to discover newly added network resources.
  - On the Windows computer, map a Mac OS X Server share point to a drive letter. You can do this by opening the **Network Neighborhood** and choosing **Tools > Map Network Drive**.
  - Note: If Windows computers are properly configured for networking and connected to the network, client users can connect to the Windows file service of Mac OS X Server even if they can’t see the server icon in the **Network Neighborhood** window.

### General Problems With File Services
For possible solutions to the following additional file services problems, see the chapter on solving problems in the file services administration guide:
- Users can’t find a shared item.
- Users can’t see the contents of a share point.
- You can’t find a volume or directory to use as a share point.

### Problems With Windows Print Service
- **Windows Users Can’t Print**:
  - Ensure the print service is running and accessible.
  - Verify the printer is correctly configured and connected.
  - Check for any network issues that might prevent printing.
