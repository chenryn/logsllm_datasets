### Matched Filter for Profiling Wireless Signals

#### Challenges and Solutions
Major challenges in using a matched filter for profiling wireless signals include adjusting the sensitivity of the filter to handle amplitude fluctuations. Possible solutions to this problem include signal normalization and equalization.

### Conclusion
We have demonstrated that the matched filter can be reliably used to build signal profiles, which can be employed to discriminate between Ethernet cards of different models. By applying the matched filter in non-traditional ways, we have also shown that it is possible to distinguish between seemingly identical cards, even those that appear to originate from the same manufacturing lot. Additionally, we have established that the analog signal characteristics of Ethernet devices can be tracked, making them suitable for use in network access control schemes. The techniques used to evaluate the effectiveness of the matched filter method have been presented. Future work will focus on extending our methods to high-speed (100Mb and 1Gb) and wireless domains (802.11b, sensor networks, and RFID systems), as well as exploring how device behavior changes due to environmental factors and aging.
