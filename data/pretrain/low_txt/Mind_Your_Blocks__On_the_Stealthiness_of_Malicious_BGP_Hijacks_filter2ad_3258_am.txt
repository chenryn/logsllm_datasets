### Episode 1: February to May 2013

**Short-lived Hijacks (C.1)**
- Out of 2,620 short-lived hijacked IP prefixes, 58 sent spam emails to our spam traps between February and May 2013.
- **Figure 6** illustrates the BGP announcements, spam, and blacklisted spam sources for a sample of 25 out of these 58 prefixes. The figure highlights:
  - A strong temporal correlation between BGP announcements and spam activity.
  - A low number (7 out of 58) of IP address blocks were blacklisted by Spamhaus before the end of the hijack.
- In total, 4,149 spam emails were received from the short-lived hijacked IP address blocks. We extracted 1,174 unique URLs from this spam.

**Long-lived Hijacks (C.1)**
- This section provides a detailed analysis of the 35 long-lived hijacks (out of the total 2,655 hijacks) based on the five characteristics described earlier.
- **Figure 5** shows the spam and blacklisted spam sources along with BGP announcements related to long-lived hijacked IP prefixes. Since these prefixes were not announced before or after being hijacked, all BGP announcements in the figure pertain to the hijack period.
- Six out of 35 IP address ranges sent spam to our spam traps, totaling 815 spam emails. The spam was primarily received at the start of the hijack period.
- No IP source was found to be blacklisted at the time the spam was received. However, two networks (193.138.172.0/22 and 91.198.40.0/24) out of the 35 became blacklisted by Spamhaus within two days after they were hijacked and we observed spam originating from them. Four additional networks, which did not send spam to our spam traps, also became blacklisted, though it took longer for them to appear on a blacklist. Specifically:
  - For 61.45.251.0/24 and 115.85.133.0/24, it took two weeks, and the hijack had ended by the time they appeared on a blacklist.
  - For 91.220.63.0/24 and 192.12.131.0/24, it took one month and two months, respectively, before they appeared on a blacklist.
- Additionally, 26 out of 35 IP prefixes were never announced on the Internet before being hijacked. The remaining 9 were hijacked on average one year after remaining unadvertised for at least one day, and up to a maximum of three years and two months.

**Disclaimer**: The IP address blocks and ASes involved in the hijacks between January 2013 and June 2014 may have been abused during that period and might now be used legitimately.

### Episode 2: June 2013 to June 2014

**Short-lived Hijacks**
- During the second period, from June 2013 to June 2014, we uncovered an intriguing phenomenon involving 2,562 short-lived hijacks, representing 97.8% of all short-lived hijacks identified.
- **Figure 7** depicts a sample of 87 (out of 2,562) hijacks that occurred in June 2014 and highlights the following:
