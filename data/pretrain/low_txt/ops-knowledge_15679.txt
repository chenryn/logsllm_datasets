### Summary of Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:09:17 to 18:09:23 on October 18, details multiple issues and attempts related to lease renewal and server communication in a Hadoop environment. The key points are as follows:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component repeatedly fails to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]`.
   - The initial failure occurs at 18:09:17, with subsequent failures at 18:09:18, 18:09:19, 18:09:20, 18:09:21, and 18:09:22.
   - Each failure is followed by a warning that the system will retry shortly.

2. **Server Address Changes**:
   - The `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` component detects address changes for the server `msra-sa-41` at both port `9000` and `8030`.
   - The old address `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:port` is updated to `msra-sa-41:port`.

3. **RMCommunicator Allocator Issues**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` component attempts to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030` but encounters errors.
   - Connection retries are logged at 18:09:18, 18:09:20, and 18:09:22.
   - The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS)`, meaning it will attempt up to 10 times with a 1-second interval between each attempt.
   - Errors in contacting the Resource Manager (RM) are logged at 18:09:18, 18:09:20, and 18:09:22.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **18:09:17**: 
  - A warning is issued by the `LeaseRenewer` indicating a failure to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` for 260 seconds.
  
- **18:09:18**:
  - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` logs an info message about retrying the connection to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
  - An error is logged indicating a failure in contacting the RM.
  - A warning is issued about an address change for the server at port `9000`.
  - Another lease renewal failure is logged, this time for 261 seconds.

- **18:09:19**:
  - A warning is issued about an address change for the server at port `8030`.
  - Another address change warning is logged for port `9000`.
  - A third lease renewal failure is logged, this time for 262 seconds.

- **18:09:20**:
  - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` logs another retry attempt to connect to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
  - An error is logged again for failing to contact the RM.
  - An address change warning is logged for port `9000`.
  - A fourth lease renewal failure is logged, this time for 263 seconds.

- **18:09:21**:
  - A warning is issued about an address change for the server at port `8030`.
  - Another address change warning is logged for port `9000`.
  - A fifth lease renewal failure is logged, this time for 264 seconds.

- **18:09:22**:
  - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` logs another retry attempt to connect to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
  - An error is logged again for failing to contact the RM.
  - An address change warning is logged for port `9000`.
  - A sixth lease renewal failure is logged, this time for 265 seconds.

- **18:09:23**:
  - A final warning is issued about an address change for the server at port `8030`.

### Conclusion

The log indicates ongoing issues with lease renewal and server connectivity. The system is attempting to handle these issues by retrying connections and renewals, but the problems persist. The address changes detected may be contributing to the connectivity issues. Further investigation into the network configuration and server status is recommended to resolve these issues.
