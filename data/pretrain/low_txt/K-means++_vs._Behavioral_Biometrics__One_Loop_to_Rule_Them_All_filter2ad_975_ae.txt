### Performance Analysis Against Original Study

We analyzed the performance of our adversary against the best-performing one-class and two-class classifiers from the original study by Antal et al. [4]. There were a few differences compared to their original study. We had access to a larger dataset from an online source [3], and we used a different protocol for selecting training and test samples, as explained in Section IV A. However, the Equal Error Rate (EER) results in Table V are within the same range as those reported in the original study [4].

#### Experimental Results

**Table V: Summary of Experimental Results on Touchscreen Swipe Dataset**

| Classifier Name | EER MasterKey | Gaussian Mixture | Random Forests |
|-----------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1 try           | 0.03          | 0.04             | 0.069           |
| 10 tries        | 0.03          | 0.11             | 0.12            |
| 50 tries        | 0.05          | 0.32             | -               |

For the adversaries, MasterKey and Targeted K-means++, the values represent the fraction of users compromised after a given number of tries.

### Adversary Testing

We tested the Targeted K-means++ adversary and MasterKey on this authentication system. These adversaries could be applied without any modifications since they operate on vectors of feature values. The Indiscriminate K-means++ adversary, which is tailored to specific properties of keystroke dynamics, could not be applied to this dataset.

As shown in Table V and Figure 4, the results on this dataset follow similar trends observed in the keystroke dynamics datasets. The first attempt, which targets the mean of the impostor samples, is not very successful. This is particularly detrimental for the MasterKey adversary, which remains close to the mean of the distribution. In contrast, the K-means++ adversary quickly explores the sample space to find more challenging queries. After 10 attempts, it breaks into a significant proportion of the classifiers, similar to the results seen in the keystroke dynamics dataset. Ultimately, almost all user classifiers are compromised.

### Conclusion and Future Work

Behavioral biometrics is a promising field, but it is not yet a reliable solution for authentication. We proposed two adversarial agents that require different levels of effort from the adversary. Both attack methods outperformed previously studied attack methods in the literature, indicating that current state-of-the-art classifiers offer little protection against such adversaries. The Indiscriminate K-means++ adversary's ability to conduct attacks without additional costs for collecting samples is particularly concerning for keystroke dynamics systems.

Past research has focused on improving classifiers against naive adversaries, but our work highlights the need for more research from an adversarial perspective before these authentication systems can be adopted in sensitive contexts. The design of our K-means++ adversaries leverages the common intuition that a person's behavioral data belongs to a "cluster" rather than being absolutely unique, suggesting that these techniques may generalize to other types of behavioral data. The results on the touchscreen swipes dataset support this claim.

From a practical standpoint, simulating an attack on a touchscreen-based system is more challenging than on a keystroke dynamics system due to the diversity of touchscreen features like pressure and finger size. While a swipes-based classifier is currently more secure, motivated attackers may develop methods to bypass these limitations.

Previous research has relied on average Equal Error Rate scores across all subjects to measure classifier robustness. To develop more robust behavioral biometric classifiers, it would be useful to benchmark against the adversarial agents proposed in this paper. For instance, one-class classifiers have been the dominant method in keystroke dynamics literature, performing as well as two-class classifiers in terms of EER. However, against both adversarial algorithms, two-class classifiers performed better, suggesting a future direction to bridge the gap between idealized and practical versions of such classifiers.

From the adversarial perspective, extending these methods to free text-based classifiers is a potential area for future work. Free text classifiers use a continuous stream of input text, leading to differences in the features and algorithms utilized. Conceptually, the Indiscriminate K-means++ adversary should be well-suited to generate adversarial samples against free text classifiers as well.
