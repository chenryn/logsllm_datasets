### Managing Connections

#### Limiting User Connection Time
You can set a time limit for user connections to the server. Additionally, you can specify the number of simultaneous connections to websites on the server at any given time.

#### Setting Simultaneous Connections for the Web Server
1. In Server Admin, select the Web service for the server you want to configure.
2. Click Settings in the button bar.
3. In the General pane, enter a number in the "Maximum simultaneous connections" field.
   - The range for maximum simultaneous connections is 1 to 2048.
   - The default maximum is 500, but you can adjust this number based on the desired performance of your server.
4. Click Save.
   - The web service will restart.

**Note:** Simultaneous connections refer to concurrent HTTP client connections. Browsers often request multiple parts of a webpage simultaneously, and each request counts as a connection. A high number of simultaneous connections can be reached if the site has pages with many elements and a large number of users are accessing the server at once.

#### Setting Persistent Connections for the Web Server
1. In Server Admin, select the Web service for the server you want to configure.
2. Click Settings in the button bar.
3. In the General pane, enter a number in the "Maximum persistent connections" field.
   - The range for maximum persistent connections is 1 to 2048.
   - The default setting of 500 provides better performance.
4. Click Save.
   - The web service will restart.

**Note:** Persistent connections allow the web server to respond to multiple requests from a client without closing the connection each time, which improves efficiency and performance.

#### Setting a Connection Timeout Interval
1. In Server Admin, select the Web service for the server you want to configure.
2. Click Settings in the button bar.
3. In the General pane, enter a number in the "Connection timeout" field to specify the amount of time that can pass between requests before the session is disconnected by the web server.
   - The range for connection timeout is 0 to 9999 seconds.
4. Click Save.
   - The web service will restart.

### Setting Up Proxy Caching
A proxy allows users to check a local server for frequently used files, which can speed up response times and reduce network traffic. The proxy stores recently accessed files in a cache on your web server.

1. In Server Admin, select the Web service for the server you want to configure.
2. Click Settings in the button bar.
3. In the Proxy pane, click Enable Proxy.
4. Set the maximum cache size.
   - When the cache reaches this size, the oldest files are deleted from the cache folder.
5. Enter the pathname for the cache folder in the "Cache folder" field.
   - You can also use the Browse button to select the folder.
   - If you are administering a remote server, file service must be running on the remote server to use the Browse button.
   - If you change the folder location from the default, you will need to update the owner and group to `www` in the Finder.
6. Click Save.
   - The web service will restart.

**Note:** If the proxy is enabled, any site on the server can be used as the proxy.

### Blocking Websites from Your Web Server Cache
If your web server is set up to act as a proxy, you can prevent it from caching specific websites.

1. In Server Admin, select the Web service for the server you want to configure.
2. Click Settings in the button bar.
3. In the Proxy pane, click Enable Proxy.
4. Do one of the following:
   - Click the Add button, enter the URL of the website you want to block, and click Add.
   - Drag a list of websites (in comma-separated or tab-separated format) to the "Blocked hosts" field.
5. Click Save.
   - The web service will restart.

### Using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) provides security for a site and its users by authenticating the server, encrypting information, and maintaining message integrity.

- **About SSL:**
  - SSL was developed by Netscape and uses authentication and encryption technology from RSA Data Security, Inc.
  - For detailed information about the SSL protocol, see:
    - [Netscape SSL Draft](http://www.netscape.com/eng/ssl3/draft302.txt)
    - [Netscape Developer Conference Proceedings](http://developer.netscape.com/misc/developer/conference/proceedings/cs2/index.html)
  - The Apache web server in Mac OS X Server supports SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLSv1. More information is available at [mod_ssl.org](http://www.modssl.org).

- **How SSL Works:**
  - The Apache server in Mac OS X Server uses a public key-private key combination to protect information.
  - A browser encrypts information using a public key provided by the server, and only the server has a private key that can decrypt that information.
  - When SSL is implemented, a browser connects to the server using the `https` prefix in the URL, rather than `http`.
  - The browser and server exchange messages to determine the strongest cipher they both recognize, and then establish a secure connection.

### Using WebDAV
Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) allows you or your users to make changes to websites while the sites are running.

- **Enabling WebDAV:**
  - Enable WebDAV for individual sites and assign access privileges for the sites and web folders.
  - See “Enabling WebDAV on Websites” on page 30 for details.

### Using Tomcat
Tomcat adds Java servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) capabilities to Mac OS X Server.

- **Setting Up Tomcat:**
  - You can set Tomcat to start automatically whenever the server starts up.
  - Use Server Admin or the command-line tool to enable the Tomcat module.
  - See “Tomcat” on page 58 for more information about Tomcat and how to use it with your web server.

### Viewing Web Service Status
In Server Admin, you can check the current state of the Apache server and which server modules are active.

- **Web Service Overview:**
  - Open Server Admin and click Overview in the button bar to see a summary of server activity and the server’s start date and time.

- **Web Service Modules in Use:**
  - In Server Admin, select the Web service for the server you want to configure.
  - Click Settings in the button bar and go to the Modules pane to view the list of modules in use and those available but not in use.

- **Viewing Logs of Web Service Activity:**
  - In Server Admin, select the Web service for the server you want to configure.
  - Click Logs in the button bar and select the log you want to view from the list.

### Managing Websites
Use the Server Admin application to set up and manage the essential components of web service.
