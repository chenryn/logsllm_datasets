# Tracking and Analysis of Bitcoin Thefts

## Introduction
Table 3 below summarizes the tracking of several significant Bitcoin thefts. For each theft, we provide an approximate amount of stolen bitcoins, the date of the theft, the movement of the funds post-theft, and whether any of the stolen bitcoins were sent to known exchanges. The movement types are denoted as follows:
- **A**: Aggregation (moving bitcoins from multiple addresses into a single one)
- **P**: Peeling chain (peeling off small amounts from a large holding address)
- **S**: Split (dividing a large amount of bitcoins among multiple addresses)
- **F**: Folding (mixing stolen funds with other, non-stolen funds to obscure the trail)

| Service | Amount Stolen (BTC) | Date | Movement Type | Sent to Exchanges? |
|---------|---------------------|------|---------------|--------------------|
| Linode  | 3,171               | Mar 2012 | A/P | Yes |
| Betcoin | 18,547              | May 2012 | A/P | Yes |
| Bitcoinica | 40,000            | Jul 2012 | A/P | Yes |
| Bitfloor | 24,078             | Sep 2012 | A/P | Yes |
| Trojan  | 3,257               | Oct 2012 | A/P | No |

### Methodology
For each theft, we identified the specific set of transactions that represented the theft, where the sender was the service being stolen from, and the recipient was the thief. We then manually inspected the subsequent transactions to determine the type of movements involved. Our findings are summarized in Table 3.

### Analysis of Theft Movements
The movement of stolen funds ranged from sophisticated layering and mixing to simple and straightforward. This analysis highlights the potential for anonymity provided by Bitcoin and the ways in which current usage falls short of this potential. Thieves who used more complex strategies made it difficult to track the flow of bitcoins, while those who did not use such strategies left ample opportunity to trace the stolen funds directly to exchanges.

#### Case Study: Betcoin Theft
On April 11, 2012, Betcoin, an early gambling site, was hacked, resulting in the theft of 3,171 BTC in four installments (2,902, 165, 17, and 87 BTC). The stolen bitcoins remained in the thief's address until March 15, 2013, when they were aggregated into a single large address. This address then initiated a peeling chain. After 10 hops, 374.49 BTC were sent to known exchanges, including Bitcoin-24 and Mt. Gox.

#### Other Thefts
- **Bitcoinica (May 2012)**: We observed a peeling chain after an aggregation, with large amounts (hundreds of BTC) peeled off directly to known exchanges. In total, 4,588 BTC were sent to three different exchanges (BTC-e, CampBX, and Bitstamp).
- **Bitfloor (Sep 2012)**: Large peels from initial peeling chains were aggregated, and the process was repeated. Despite the complexity, we still observed 661.12 BTC sent to popular exchanges (Mt. Gox, BTC-e, and Bitstamp).
- **Trojan (Oct 2012)**: The thief installed a trojan on individual users' computers. Most of the 3,257 BTC stolen remained in the thief's address, with only 400 BTC moving, making it difficult to track the flow of funds.

### Conclusion
Our ability to track stolen funds provides evidence that even the most motivated Bitcoin users (i.e., criminals) often engage in patterns of use that erode their anonymity. While some thieves use sophisticated methods, many do not, leaving a trail that can be followed. This suggests that using exchanges to cash out at scale is inevitable, and thus, Bitcoin does not currently provide a particularly easy or effective way to transact large volumes of illicitly-obtained money.

## Related Work
Since its inception, Bitcoin's security and anonymity have been subjects of extensive research. Key works include:

- **Reid and Harrigan [17]**: Analyzed the flow of stolen money from the MyBitcoin theft using clustering algorithms.
- **Ron and Shamir [18]**: Examined the largest Bitcoin transactions and concluded that there is significant hoarding in the system.
- **Androulaki et al. [2]**: Focused on privacy concerns and the complexity of change accounts.
- **Miers et al. [12]**: Presented Zerocoin, a system designed to enhance Bitcoin's anonymity.
- **Möser [14]**: Evaluated the anonymity of Bitcoin mix services.

- **Moore and Christin [13]**: Analysis of Bitcoin exchange failures.

## Conclusions
This study provides a longitudinal characterization of the Bitcoin network, focusing on the rise of services and the growing gap between potential and actual anonymity. We developed a new clustering heuristic based on change addresses, allowing us to cluster addresses belonging to the same user. Our findings suggest that while Bitcoin offers potential for anonymity, current usage patterns often fall short, especially for less sophisticated users. Future work should explore how this gap will evolve and what measures users can take to achieve stronger anonymity guarantees.
