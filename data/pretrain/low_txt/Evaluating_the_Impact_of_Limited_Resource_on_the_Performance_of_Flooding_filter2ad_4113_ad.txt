### Differences in Results

While the results show some similarities, there are notable differences, particularly in the 95% confidence intervals for timing. Ganesan et al. measure timing in milliseconds, whereas the simulator uses cycles. For medium transmission power, considering 95% of the network nodes, the experimental error [8] is 18% for reception time and 4% for settling, based on 7 runs with a 156-node network. In contrast, the simulation error is 55% for reception time and 5% for settling, based on 100 runs with a 169-node network. The small network's instability, with significant performance variations depending on the order of node transmissions, may account for the larger errors observed in the 100 simulation runs. Larger networks, however, exhibit more stable performance.

### Footprint Analysis

Our simulations use an average footprint for each power setting, derived from Woo’s experimental data for 110 of the nodes used in the flooding experiments [15], [8]. Interestingly, the footprint size of individual motes can vary dramatically even at the same power setting. For example, averaging over the 110 motes measured at medium power, the average number of footprint cells with good signal is 113. When the full footprint was not directly measurable, the number of good cells was inferred from the experimental data. At medium power, the worst-performing node's footprint contains an average of 47 good cells, while the best-performing node's footprint contains an average of 297 good cells. Using the average footprint for all nodes can be misleading. One solution is to incorporate standard deviations into the footprint calculation algorithm [10]. However, since the differences in footprints seem to be associated with specific mote hardware and positions rather than just performance noise, this approach does not fully capture the diversity of node performance. Further research is needed to address this issue. Node diversity may be less significant for the more reliable radio hardware in current-generation Mica 2 motes [20], [17].

### Related Work

Our simulation experiments were motivated by a recent empirical study of flooding protocol performance in wireless sensor networks [8], [15]. This study used a sensor network consisting of 156 Berkeley motes [20] placed in a regular grid pattern in a 26-foot by 26-foot landscape. Each node, in turn, transmitted 20 packets at different power settings, and the number of received packets by each surrounding node was recorded [15]. In a second experiment, a flood was initiated from a node in the middle of the grid, and each node recorded its transmission and reception of messages during the flood. Using raw data from the footprint experiment [15], we estimated the probability of reception given distance and direction from the source. These probabilities were used in our simulation experiments to define transmission footprints. We also used the same network topology, transmission powers, and flooding protocol as the empirical study.

### Analytical Studies of Flooding Algorithms

Several analytical studies of flooding algorithms are relevant to our investigation. Ni et al. [21] present a study of the broadcast storm problem in ad hoc networks, including several variations on the basic flooding protocol. They use geometric analysis to investigate broadcast redundancy, contention, and collisions, and simulation to analyze the performance of flooding in mobile networks with different node densities. Sasson et al. [22] investigate probabilistic flooding, looking for phase transitions using an ideal circular broadcast footprint. A simulation model for wireless sensor networks that incorporates a noisy footprint model is presented in [6] and used to analyze the performance of protocols such as flooding. The simulator searches for configurations that optimize certain properties, such as maximizing reliability while minimizing power consumption. Epidemiological models based on differential equations have been used to analyze flooding algorithms [23], assuming a circular transmission footprint and considering different network node densities. These models describe the infection of all nodes, comparable to time efficiency in this paper, but do not allow for changes in the protocol or the measurement of settling time.

Woo, Tong, and Culler [10] investigate the performance of routing protocols, including flooding, using a Matlab simulator that accounts for footprint noise similarly to our model, and a 50-node experimental network. They compare the performance of different routing protocols in the same WSN setting, whereas we examine the effects of underlying characteristics such as landscape size, transmission power, and MAC layer constants.

### Conclusions

Our simulation experiments support the following observations on the impact of limited resources on the performance of flooding in a wireless sensor network:

- **Low Power Transmissions:** Low power transmissions have the best time and resource efficiency for the dense network topology we simulated. They are also the most energy-efficient for the network as a whole and for each individual node.
- **Scaling Properties:** The flooding algorithm has excellent scaling properties for large networks. Most activity occurs in parallel, and the only bottlenecks are local effects where network nodes in the same transmission neighborhood must wait for others to transmit before they can obtain the broadcast medium. The performance of large networks is more stable than that of small networks. For example, the number of cycles for 95% reception time has errors of 5% to 9% for large networks, compared to 55% for a small network.
- **Tunability:** The performance of flooding algorithms is readily tunable, even with a fixed node topology, because variables such as transmission power and MAC layer backoff are accessible to the developer. Adjusting the maximum backoff, for example, can improve protocol performance in dense networks for all configurations tested, despite the noisiness of low power radio footprints and the high probability of collisions between competing transmissions from overlapping footprints.
- **Robustness:** The flooding protocol is over 99% robust.
- **Resource Limitations:** The resource limitation of noisy footprints versus idealized dense footprints in wireless sensor networks significantly impacts performance. At very low transmission power, noisy footprints actually improve the performance of flooding, while at other transmission powers, this resource limitation leads to worse performance than with idealized footprints. This result demonstrates that simulation experiments should take into account the observed transmission footprints of motes and not rely on idealized transmission models.

We have presented an object-oriented simulation framework, Boris, and described its instantiation as a wireless sensor network simulator. Our study highlights several areas for further work, including the need for more empirical data from sensor network applications to develop accurate models and establish a systematic basis for protocol design and deployment. We also plan to add classes to the simulator to model the energy available to each sensor node, environmental factors, and higher-level protocols such as energy-aware routing protocols.
