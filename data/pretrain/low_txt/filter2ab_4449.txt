**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Bash History

Adversaries may search the bash command history on compromised systems to uncover insecurely stored credentials. The `history` utility in Bash maintains a record of commands entered by users at the command line. When a user logs out, this history is written to the `.bash_history` file, which is typically located at `~/.bash_history` for each user. By default, this file retains the userâ€™s last 500 commands.

Users often inadvertently enter usernames and passwords as command-line arguments, which are then saved to the `.bash_history` file upon logout. Adversaries can exploit this by examining the `.bash_history` file for potential credentials. This technique can be particularly effective if users have a habit of entering sensitive information directly into the command line.
