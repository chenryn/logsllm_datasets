## Abstract

The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit North America in March 2020, disrupting personal and professional lives and leading to work-from-home mandates in many jurisdictions. In this paper, we examine two years of empirical network traffic measurement data from the University of Calgaryâ€™s campus network to study the effects of the pandemic on a post-secondary education environment. Our study focuses on the online meeting applications and services used, as well as traffic volumes, directionality, and diurnal patterns, as observed from our campus edge network. The main highlights from our study include changes to inbound and outbound traffic volumes, reduced traffic asymmetry, significant growth in Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and VPN traffic, structural changes in workday traffic patterns, and a more global distribution of campus network users.

## 1. Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic affected everyone's daily life, both personally and professionally. Lockdowns, travel restrictions, and stay-at-home orders were in effect in most parts of the world in 2020, leading to significant changes in how people work and study. Many individuals relied more extensively on the Internet and online tools for their daily tasks [11].

In a broader sense, the pandemic provided a glimpse into the possible Future of Work (FoW) [4, 23, 29], a term used to describe a flexible work-from-home society enabled by digital connectivity, telepresence, and computer networks. With the continuous move to cloud infrastructures within organizations and universities around the world [12], most people were aware of the possibility of working remotely before the pandemic, but relatively few had done so. At the very least, the pandemic accelerated the transition to FoW and made it real for many more people, changing some mindsets and possibly influencing remote work and online learning technologies for the future.

In this paper, we study the effects of the pandemic within the context of a post-secondary education environment. We do so from a network-level viewpoint, by examining the changes in Internet traffic patterns into and out of our campus network. Specifically, we analyze two years of empirical connection-level network traffic data to identify changes in the volume, timing, and directionality of traffic, as well as the application mix. This offers insights into how the pandemic affected the work and study habits of our campus community.

A main focus in our study is on the use of Zoom video-conferencing software, which was adopted by the University of Calgary (UCalgary) as the preferred solution for remote teaching and learning. Zoom has been widely adopted by many universities, companies, and other organizations for remote communication purposes. Zoom offers a free account with some limitations, such as a maximum meeting duration of 40 minutes. However, many organizations, including UCalgary, purchased the corporate license for Zoom to allow their members to use it for teaching, learning, meetings, and conferences without the duration limit.

Zoom is not the only video-conferencing solution on the market. Microsoft Teams and Google Meet are also popular online conferencing applications used by our campus community for meeting purposes. Some features are free for public use, while others are accessible only to licensed organizations. Other popular solutions include FaceTime, Skype, Vidyo, and Webex.

In our work, we study the network traffic of three online meeting applications on our university campus network. We focus on characterizing the network traffic from these applications, as seen on our campus. As a baseline, we provide pre-pandemic traffic measurements from 2019 and the early months of 2020, and compare 2020 traffic with this baseline.

Our main objectives are to answer the following questions:
- How has the campus network traffic changed during the pandemic, and why?
- What are the usage patterns for Zoom as the most prominent online video conferencing application on our campus?
- What other network applications and services are used to support remote work and learning?
- What are the potential implications of these changes on the future usage of our campus network?

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
- We compare empirical network traffic data from 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (pandemic) to identify structural changes in traffic patterns.
- We identify the emergence of Zoom and Teams as popular applications for teaching and meetings, respectively, and characterize Zoom usage.
- We identify temporal and geo-spatial changes in how our research and education community accesses and uses campus network resources.

The results from our work should be of value not only to networking researchers but also to educators, academic administrators, and IT professionals. Using longitudinal data analysis, we provide several key insights into the growth and evolution of network traffic for online learning and the performance implications of such traffic on a campus edge network.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses prior related work on network traffic characterization and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Section 3 describes the methodology for our study, focusing on our network environment, our network traffic measurement infrastructure, and our data analysis tools. Section 4 presents the main high-level results from our study, while Section 5 provides detailed results regarding Zoom traffic. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

## 2. Related Work

Researchers in academia and industry rely on network traffic measurement as an increasingly important methodology to obtain data, analyze Internet traffic, assess network performance, identify network security issues, and investigate different features of new protocols and applications. The book by Crovella and Krishnamurthy [9] provides the technical underpinnings of this discipline.

The usage of network traffic measurement and workload characterization techniques is broad and extensive. Classic examples include the characterization of wide-area TCP connections [25], Web traffic [3, 6], and email traffic [28]. More recent works have studied video streaming services [1, 13], as well as the growth and evolution of online social networks [15, 22, 30]. Such studies offer insights into the changing nature of Internet traffic and its potential effects on network performance. We follow a similar approach in our work.

The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected Internet usage. Since the onset of the pandemic, several research works have noted changes in the timing, volume, and directionality of traffic, as many people switched to work-from-home scenarios. One of the first was the weekly blog by Labovitz [16], analyzing data from several networks in Western Europe. As of March 9, 2020, this report noted 20-40% increases in traffic during the evening peak hours, 3x growth in teleconferencing apps (e.g., Skype, Zoom), and 4x growth in gaming traffic [16]. A later report [17] indicated that aggregate traffic was up by over 25%, and that the normalized peak traffic was 25-30% above pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, DDoS attacks increased by 40-50% after the pandemic [17]. Similar observations arise in our work, along with insights specific to Zoom traffic.

The Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group (BITAG) produced a detailed report on how Internet traffic changed and how network operators and providers managed the unprecedented circumstances [5]. Although focused on the US, this report provides valuable insights into network operations from many different vantage points, including core, edge, and ISP locations. The report states that the Internet, in general, was robust during the pandemic and continued to perform well. Several performance issues experienced by some users were attributed to end-user system configurations and outdated wireless equipment. Dramatic growth in VPN usage by campus networks is also reported in this document, along with notable asymmetry in traffic growth between upstream and downstream. The busy hours for the downstream were in the evening with 12-25% growth, while the upstream peak hours start in the morning and run most of the day until about midnight. Our results also confirm VPN traffic growth and noticeable shifts in network usage patterns.

Feldmann et al. [11] provided a multi-perspective look at pandemic effects on Internet traffic, using datasets from ISPs, IXPs, and mobile network operators. The main highlights were shifts of 15-20% in Internet traffic within a week of lockdown. Their paper noted the emergence of non-hypergiants among the contributors to traffic growth and identified a plethora of network applications being used in work-from-home environments. Our work confirms Zoom as a new potential hypergiant.

Lutu et al. [20] presented an analysis of the changes in user mobility patterns and how this affected the cellular traffic of a UK mobile network operator. They observed an overall decrease in mobility (i.e., roaming) by 50%, with non-uniform geographical changes. They reported a 150% increase in voice traffic, a 20% overall decrease in download traffic, and a 10% increase in uplink traffic. Nonetheless, the network operator was able to maintain service quality standards. Our work does not address cellular traffic at all, but we do see reduced WiFi usage from having fewer people on campus.

Liu et al. [19] studied how several US providers responded to changes in Internet traffic demands during the pandemic. They also identified some differences between rural versus urban users, which can affect QoS/QoE for online learning applications. The shift to using online meeting applications and platforms for learning and collaboration is also well documented in the literature [26, 27]. Our work indicates potential performance problems when Zoom is used for teaching and learning on a large campus edge network.

The closest study to our own so far is by Favale et al. [10], who studied traffic on the campus network of the Politecnico di Torino (PoliTO). They analyzed the changes in traffic patterns due to the restrictions in place in Turin, Italy, and the switch to online learning solutions. They observed that the campus inbound traffic drastically decreased, as fewer students were on campus, while outbound traffic more than doubled, due to the remote learning platform installed at the campus to support all online classroom instruction. Furthermore, they provided insight into the growth of online collaboration platforms, VPN, and remote desktop services. Compared to their work, our research spans an entire calendar year of pandemic-related network traffic data (2020), rather than just a few months, with the previous calendar year (2019) as a baseline. Furthermore, our campus uses the widely-adopted Zoom platform for remote teaching and learning, rather than a custom in-house solution. We provide observations on how the usage of online learning and meeting applications has changed in terms of connection counts and traffic volume, and offer insights into these changes.

A recent paper [7] studied three major videoconferencing systems: Zoom, Webex, and Google Meet. They used a cloud-based emulated framework to generate videoconferencing sessions on these applications and then measure, study, and compare them. They measured streaming delay (lag), as well as a range of well-known objective QoE metrics, including PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure), and VIFp (Pixel Visual Information Fidelity). They found that these systems vary in terms of geographic location, resulting in different QoE. For example, Webex sessions created in US-west are subject to artificial detours via relays in US-east, inflating their lags. They saw that high-motion video feeds experience non-negligible QoE degradation on all three systems compared to low-motion video streaming. Finally, systems react differently under bandwidth constraints.

Another recent study [21] compared Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet in an experimental testbed. They tried to find the baseline level of Internet performance needed to support common videoconferencing applications for remote learning. Under simulated conditions, they measured the bandwidth utilization, time to recovery from interruptions, and fairness under competitive circumstances.

Our work differs from these papers as we study empirically-captured network traffic data from thousands of users on our campus network. Our companion paper [8] developed tools to analyze Zoom sessions and meetings from these captured data and provides a microscopic view of Zoom traffic. This paper, on the other hand, provides a longitudinal (macroscopic) view of Zoom, Teams, Meet, VPN, and other applications involved in remote working and learning during the pandemic.

## 3. Data Collection and Methodology

This section discusses the methods and technologies used for our network traffic characterization study, as well as some of the limitations of our approach. We start with some brief contextual information about the university environment that we studied.

### 3.1 University Environment

UCalgary is a medium-sized university with about 30,000 students. The academic schedule is semester-based, with the Fall (September to December) and Winter (January to April) semesters each having a full set of course offerings. There are also Spring (May to June) and Summer (July to August) semesters, each with reduced course offerings.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the switch from in-person learning to remote online learning took place quite abruptly on March 13th, 2020, during the Winter semester. Online learning remained the norm throughout the rest of the calendar year, though a small number of students (20%) were allowed back on campus in Fall 2020, mainly in capstone and/or lab-based experiential learning courses with limited enrollments.

#### Videoconferencing

With the shift to remote learning, students, staff, and faculty members started to use online meetings and screen-sharing applications to continue with the courses, academic tasks, and regular or occasional meetings. The University officially advised its community to use Zoom for teaching and learning, and it has been the dominant way of teaching classes since the lockdown. Microsoft Teams is offered for internal or external meetings. An organizational license was purchased for Zoom, and Microsoft Teams is an integrated application within the Office365 suite available via a campus-wide license.

#### Remote Access

Being physically away from campus raised access issues for almost everyone. For example, many faculty, staff, and graduate students needed to access computers in their offices or labs to proceed with their work or research. Even undergraduate students using systems in different labs before the lockdown needed to connect remotely to those systems. Furthermore, certain services require access from a university IP address, augmenting the demand to connect to the campus network. Three different remote access solutions were offered to resolve these issues: Secure Shell (SSH), Virtual Private Network (VPN), and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

#### Authentication

Our campus network uses an authentication service that checks user credentials before accessing enterprise resources, such as the wireless network, learning management system, email, and Office365 applications.

### 3.2 Passive Measurement

Passive measurement involves capturing ambient network traffic and analyzing it either online or offline. With this technique, no additional traffic is produced, and the ordinary network traffic is not altered in any way. We collected two years of empirical network traffic data using this approach.

Our monitor uses an Endace DAG (Data Acquisition and Generation) packet capture card. The monitor is installed in the main data center on campus and receives from the edge routers a mirrored copy of every packet entering or leaving the campus network. Those packets are then sent to a Zeek (formerly known as Bro) worker node [24]. For privacy purposes and to reduce storage requirements, Zeek aggregates all the packets of the same connection and stores a summarized entry for that connection. This summary consists of many fields, including a unique identifier of the connection, the connectionâ€™s 4-tuple of endpoint addresses/ports, the time of the first packet, duration of the connection, and the number of packets and bytes sent by both the originator and responder.

We use ARC (Advanced Research Computing), an existing HPC (High Performance Computing) cluster at UCalgary, for storage, management, and script-based processing of our traffic data. We also use Vertica, an SQL-based big data analytics platform, to analyze the captured data. Using Vertica is fast and convenient for network traffic analyses, as it supports parallel execution of SQL queries on structured data [18].
