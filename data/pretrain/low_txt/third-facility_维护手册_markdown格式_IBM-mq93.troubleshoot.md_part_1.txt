### IBM MQ Troubleshooting and Support

If you are experiencing issues with your queue manager network or IBM MQ applications, the techniques described in this document can help you diagnose and resolve these problems. For additional assistance, you can contact IBM Support through the IBM Support Site.

#### About This Task
Troubleshooting is the process of identifying and resolving the root cause of a problem. When you encounter an issue with IBM software, the troubleshooting process begins as soon as you start asking, "What happened?"

A basic high-level troubleshooting strategy involves:
1. **Recording the symptoms of the problem**
2. **Re-creating the problem**
3. **Eliminating possible causes**

If you need help with an IBM MQ issue, you can contact IBM Support through the IBM Support Site. You can also subscribe to notifications about IBM MQ fixes, troubleshooting, and other news. For more information, see “Contacting IBM Support” on page 301.

For more information about recovering after a problem, see “Recovering after failure” on page 475.

#### Procedure
1. **Record the symptoms of the problem.**
   Depending on the type of problem, whether it be with your application, server, or tools, you may receive an error message. Always record the error message, as it may contain codes that will make more sense as you investigate further. You might also receive multiple similar but subtly different error messages. Recording each one can help you pinpoint the problem's location. Sources of error messages include:
   - Problems view
   - Local error log
   - Eclipse log
   - User trace
   - Service trace
   - Error dialog boxes

   For more information, see:
   - “Using error logs” on page 353
   - “First Failure Support Technology (FFST)” on page 363
   - “Tracing” on page 375

   If an IBM MQ component or command returns an error and you need more information about the message displayed on the screen or in the log, refer to Messages and reason codes.

2. **Re-create the problem.**
   Reflect on the steps leading up to the problem and try to repeat them to see if the issue is consistently reproducible. A consistently repeatable test case can help determine the necessary solutions.
   - How did you first notice the problem?
   - Did you do anything different that made you notice the problem?
   - Is the process causing the problem a new procedure, or has it worked successfully before?
   - If it worked before, what has changed? (This can refer to any system changes, such as adding new hardware or software, or reconfiguring existing software.)
   - What was the first symptom of the problem? Were there other symptoms occurring at the same time?
   - Does the same problem occur elsewhere? Is it isolated to one machine or affecting multiple machines?
   - What messages are being generated that might indicate the problem?

   For more information about these types of questions, see “Making initial checks” on page 6 and “Detailed troubleshooting” on page 64.

3. **Eliminate possible causes.**
   Narrow down the scope of the problem by eliminating components that are not causing the issue. By using a process of elimination, you can simplify the problem and avoid wasting time on areas that are not responsible. Consult the product documentation and other available resources to help with the elimination process. Has anyone else experienced this problem? Is there a fix you can download? For more information, see “Contacting IBM Support” on page 301.

### Making Initial Checks

There are some initial checks you can perform to address common problems.

#### About This Task
Use the information and general advice provided in the subtopics to help you carry out the initial checks for your platform and rectify the problem.

#### Procedure
- Perform the initial checks for your platform:
  - **Making initial checks on AIX** on page 7
  - **Making initial checks on IBM i** on page 20
  - **Making initial checks on Linux** on page 29
  - **Making initial checks on Windows** on page 42
  - **Making initial checks on z/OS** on page 51

#### Tips for System Administrators
- Check the error logs for messages specific to your operating system:
  - **Error logs on AIX, Linux, and Windows** on page 355
  - **Error logs on IBM i** on page 358
  - **Diagnostic information produced on IBM MQ for z/OS** on page 253
- Review the contents of `qm.ini` for any configuration changes or errors.
  - For more information on changing configuration information, see:
    - Changing IBM MQ configuration information on Multiplatforms
    - Customizing your queue managers on z/OS

- If your application development teams report unexpected behavior, use trace to investigate the problems.
  - For information about using trace, see “Tracing” on page 375.

#### Tips for Application Developers
- Check the return codes from the MQI calls in your applications.
  - For a list of reason codes, see API completion and reason codes. Use the information provided in the return code to determine the cause of the problem. Follow the steps in the Programmer response sections of the reason code to resolve the problem.
- If you are unsure whether your application is working as expected, for example, if you are unsure about the parameters being passed into or out of the MQI, use trace to collect information about all the inputs and outputs of your MQI calls.
  - For more information about using trace, see “Tracing” on page 375. For more information about handling errors in MQI applications, see Handling program errors.

#### Related Concepts

### Making Initial Checks on AIX

Before delving into detailed problem determination on AIX, consider whether there is an obvious cause of the problem or an area of investigation likely to yield useful results. This approach can often save a lot of work by highlighting a simple error or narrowing down the range of possibilities.

#### About This Task
The cause of your problem could be in:
- IBM MQ
- The network
- The application
- Other applications configured to work with IBM MQ

As you go through the list of initial questions and follow the links to more information, note anything relevant to the problem. Even if your observations do not immediately suggest a cause, they may be useful later if you need to conduct a systematic problem determination exercise.

When you open a case with IBM, you can include additional IBM MQ troubleshooting information (MustGather data) that you have collected to help with investigating the problem. For more information, see “Collecting troubleshooting information for IBM Support” on page 302.

#### Procedure
1. **Identify characteristics of the problem**
   - Consider the following initial questions to help identify the cause of the problem:
     - Has IBM MQ run successfully before?
     - Have any changes been made since the last successful run?
     - Have you applied any maintenance updates?
     - Has the application run successfully before?
     - Are you receiving errors when using special characters in descriptive text for some commands?
     - Are there any error messages or return codes to help determine the location and cause of the problem?
     - Can you reproduce the problem?
     - Does the problem affect specific parts of the network?
     - Does the problem occur at specific times of the day?
     - Is the problem intermittent?

2. **Investigate potential problems with applications, commands, and messages**
   - If you encounter issues with IBM MQ applications, commands, and messages, consider the following questions to help determine the cause:
     - Are messages failing to arrive on the queue?
     - Do messages contain unexpected or corrupted information?
     - Are unexpected messages received when using distributed queues?
     - Have you received no response from a PCF command?
     - Are only some of your queues failing?
     - Does the problem affect only remote queues?
     - Is your application or system running slowly?

3. **Investigate any problems connected to IBM MQ resources, including resource usage by IBM MQ processes, insufficient resources, and your resource limit configurations.**
   - For more information, see “Additional checks for resource problems on AIX” on page 16.

4. **If you need further information to help identify the cause of the problem, see “Detailed troubleshooting” on page 64.**
