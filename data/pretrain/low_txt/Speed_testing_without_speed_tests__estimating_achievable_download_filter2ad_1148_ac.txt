### Aggregated Measurements and Throughput Estimation

We collect aggregated throughput measurements from all regions in the Pacific and Central time zones. Active throughput measurements are performed using probes located at several stationary positions. Each probe conducts a throughput measurement by downloading a 3MB file via FTP from a well-provisioned server near the Gn interface. We collect 2 to 3 measurements per probe each hour. Each region under consideration has probes in 3 to 12 different vantage points. The active maximum throughput estimate reported each hour is the mean of all measurements from all probes in that region.

The active probes are generally placed in locations with good RF (Radio Frequency) conditions, which means they are expected to perform better than the average subscriber handset.

### Flow Type Selection and Traffic Index (TI)

For the Traffic Index (TI), we select flow types based on traffic data from March 24-30, 2010. We then compute the TI-F and TI-T estimates using traffic observed from April 3-7, 2010. Additionally, we compute a naive "All 1MB+ Flows" estimate, which is the mean throughput of all flow records with total bytes ≥ 1 MB. These passive maximum throughput estimates are compared to the active estimates for each hour during the same period.

### Results

#### Comparison of Active and Passive Estimates

Figure 5 presents a scatter plot comparing active and passive estimates. Each point represents the estimate for one hour in the largest region. If the active and passive estimates were identical, the points would fall on the x=y line. The "All 1MB+ Flows" approach produces estimates significantly lower than the active measurements. The TI-F estimates are much closer but still generally lower. This discrepancy may be due to some flows in the TI being rate-limited by undetected application behaviors or because the active measurement probes are in higher-quality vantage points. In a few instances, the TI-F estimate is higher than the active measurement, likely due to variance in the small number of active measurement samples.

#### Relative Difference

To generalize this trend, we compare the relative difference between passive and active estimates across other regions. Figure 6 shows the relative difference for all regions and the top 10 regions with the most active probe vantage points. The top of each bar indicates the median relative difference (over all hours), and the error bars show the 25th and 75th percentiles. Both TI-F and TI-T estimates have roughly the same relative difference across all regions, and both have substantially smaller differences compared to the "All 1MB+ Flows" approach. Most TI-F and TI-T estimates are within 30% of the active measurements, while most "All 1MB+ Flows" estimates differ by more than 50%. An anomaly is observed in region R7, where the TI estimates have greater relative differences, possibly due to the active probes being in unrepresentative locations.

#### Correlation

In addition to similar estimate values, we expect good passive estimates to be correlated with active estimates over time. Figure 7 shows Pearson's correlation coefficient between each passive estimate time series and the corresponding active estimate time series in all regions and the top 10. The error bars show 95% confidence intervals of the correlation coefficients. A perfect correlation would have a value of 1, and any correlation greater than 0.6 is considered well-correlated. Both TI-F and TI-T are at least as correlated with the active estimates as the "All 1MB+ Flows" estimates. The correlation is substantially higher in some regions, such as R2 and R6. Regions with fewer samples, like R2, R4, R5, and R7, show less correlation. When many vantage points are aggregated, the correlations are very high (close to 0.9). To improve the TI's correlation at finer network granularities, we are increasing the sampling rate of flow types in the TI from 3% to 100% of users.

### Conclusion and Future Work

Our results demonstrate that maximum throughput can be estimated using passive measurements through judicious selection of flows. By applying the TI approach to more real traffic, we aim to resolve several outstanding issues. First, the minimum flow size necessary to reach TCP steady-state depends on RTT and available capacity, both dynamic quantities. We plan to explore how this flow size can be adjusted based on network conditions. Second, the filtering of certain flow records presents a trade-off between the number of samples and their aggregate accuracy. We will investigate how to utilize noisier rate-limited samples when non-rate-limited samples are insufficient. Third, application protocol and content-provider behavior can change over time, and we will explore how to detect such changes dynamically. Fourth, we will examine how to detect malicious and abnormal flows that skew the max-throughput estimate. Finally, while we believe the TI approach generalizes to wired networks, further study is needed to understand the impact of greater heterogeneity in vantage points and TCP stacks.
