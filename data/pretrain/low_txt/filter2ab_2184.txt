**ATT&CK ID:** T0812  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Default Credentials

Adversaries may exploit default credentials set by manufacturers or suppliers on control system devices. These default credentials often have administrative privileges and are typically required for the initial configuration of the device. As a best practice, it is strongly recommended to change the passwords for these accounts as soon as possible. However, some manufacturers may provide devices with hardcoded usernames or passwords that cannot be modified.
