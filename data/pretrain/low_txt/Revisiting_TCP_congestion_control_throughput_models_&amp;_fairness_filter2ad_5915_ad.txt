### CoreScale Performance and Fairness of BBR, Cubic, and NewReno

#### Key Findings

**Finding 7: BBR Dominance in Throughput**
- **Observation**: When competing with an equal number of NewReno or Cubic flows in CoreScale, a single BBR flow captures 99.9% of the total throughput.
- **Context**: This result aligns with previous research conducted in edge settings, which showed that BBR can capture up to 99% of the total throughput when competing with an equal number of Cubic flows [28, 45, 52].
- **Implication**: The inter-CCA (Congestion Control Algorithm) unfairness observed in edge settings persists in CoreScale, as demonstrated in Figure 8.

**Finding 8: Cubic's Throughput Advantage over NewReno**
- **Observation**: In CoreScale, Cubic achieves 70% to 80% of the total throughput when competing with an equal number of NewReno flows.
- **Context**: This finding confirms the unfairness results from past research in edge settings, as shown in Figure 5.
- **Implication**: The performance advantage of Cubic over NewReno is consistent across different network environments, highlighting the need for further fairness improvements in congestion control algorithms.

#### Supporting Evidence

- **BBR's Single Flow Dominance**: As predicted by Ware et al. [48], a single BBR flow can take up to 40% of the total throughput, regardless of the number of competing NewReno or Cubic flows. Our results confirm this behavior at scale, even when BBR competes with thousands of NewReno or Cubic flows, as illustrated in Figures 5 and 6.

- **Throughput Distribution in CoreScale**:
  - **BBR vs. NewReno**: When BBR competes with NewReno flows, it consistently captures a significant portion of the total throughput, as seen in Figure 5.
  - **BBR vs. Cubic**: Similarly, BBR outperforms Cubic in terms of throughput, as shown in Figure 6.
