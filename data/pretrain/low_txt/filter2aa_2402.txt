## SPA (Single Packet Authentication)
- **Description:**
  - SPA is a protocol that allows a remote user to authenticate securely on a “closed” system (limited or no open services).

  - Works across NAT.
  - Available for free.

A live demonstration of SPA will be provided.

## NPC (Nearly Perfect Crypto)
- **Description:**
  - NPC includes a utility for creating large one-time pads using the PRNG ISAAC.
  - Fast, simple, and efficient.
  - If key exchange is managed properly, it offers nearly unbreakable encryption (one-time pads are considered the ultimate in cryptography).
  - Key management can be challenging and may make this impractical for some users.

### NPC Demo
A live demonstration of NPC will be provided.

## Q & A
- **Note:**
  - During the Q&A session, audience members who wish to participate must sign an Ass Release Form.
  - Participants can choose any NMRC member to spank them.
