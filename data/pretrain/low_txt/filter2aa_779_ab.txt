### Final Tips
- **If Someone (Including You) Is Stuck in an Elevator**:
  1. **Don’t Panic**
     - Main lights off? Use the emergency call.
     - Main lights on? Try the following steps.
  2. **Press Door Open** (exit safely if doors open)
  3. **Press Door Close, Then Press Door Open Again**
  4. **Try Placing Calls to Other Floors, Including Lobby**
  5. **Make Sure You’re Badged In, Try Floor Calls Again**
  6. **If Authorized, Try Using Keyswitches (IND Mode)**
  7. **Verify the Cab Doors Are Closed** (unless you heard something loudly fail)
  8. **If Nothing Worked, Call For Help** (Emergency Phone or Mobile Phone or Radio)

- **Things To NEVER Try When Stuck**:
  1. **Leaving Through the Top Hatch** (dangerous and will foul up other procedures)
  2. **Exiting a Mis-Leveled Car** (if you have to jump, that’s too far!)
  3. **The Safest Place to Be is in the Elevator Itself**
