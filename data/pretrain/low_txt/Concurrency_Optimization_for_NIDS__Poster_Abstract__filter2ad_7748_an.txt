**Abstract:**
Metabolic alterations play a crucial role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) at both the systemic and central nervous system (CNS) levels. To investigate the extent and significance of these alterations, quantitative metabolomics was applied to samples from well-characterized AD patients. The study explored the association between metabolic changes and core pathological processes in AD, including amyloid pathology and tau-related neurodegeneration. Metabolic profiling, including untargeted metabolomics and targeted quantification, was performed on paired plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from clinically and biomarker-confirmed AD patients (n=40) and cognitively healthy controls (n=34). Targeted quantification focused on deregulated pathways such as the TCA cycle and its anaplerotic pathways, as well as the neuroactive tryptophan pathway. Concentrations of several TCA cycle and beta-oxidation intermediates were higher in the plasma of AD patients, while amino acid concentrations were significantly lower. Similar alterations were observed in CSF, which correlated strongly with blood-brain barrier permeability. Changes in several amino acids in CSF were associated with CSF Amyloidβ1–42. The tryptophan catabolites kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid showed significantly higher concentrations in the CSF of AD patients, correlating with either CSF Amyloidβ1–42 or tau and phosphorylated Tau-181. These results indicate AD-associated systemic dysregulation of nutrient sensing and oxidation, and CNS-specific alterations in the neuroactive tryptophan pathway. The specific association of amino acids and tryptophan catabolites with AD CSF biomarkers suggests a close relationship with core AD pathology.

**Abstract:**
Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV), is the leading cause of blindness among the elderly in developed countries. Treatment primarily involves intra-vitreal injection of anti-VEGF, but the pathogenesis and progression of this multifactorial disease remain poorly understood. Due to the chronic nature of the disease and resistance to treatment, continuous patient follow-up, personalization of treatment, and discovery of new therapeutic approaches are essential. Metabolomics provides a unique and direct insight into pathologies and treatment administration, making it well-suited for studying CNV occurrence and evolution. We applied a NMR-based metabolomics approach to sera from both clinical (AMD patients and controls) and pre-clinical (a murine model mimicking CNV development) settings. In both human and mouse models, lactate and lipoprotein profiles emerged as key metabolites, correlating with the active phase of AMD and CNV development. Pharmacological normalization of lactate levels in the mouse model, achieved by blocking pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) or using anti-VEGF treatments, inhibited CNV formation and modified lipoprotein profiles. Mechanistically, we explored the role of lactate and the modification of lipoprotein profiles according to CNV development. Our findings demonstrate that metabolomics is a valuable tool for gaining deep insights into AMD and identifying functional, traceable, and targetable molecules, opening new perspectives for optimizing and personalizing treatment and patient follow-up.

**P-16: Effect of Calorie Restriction on Metabolic Phenotypes of Intestinal Tissues in an Aging Model**
- **Presenting Author:** So Young Lim, Chonnam National University, South Korea
- **Co-Author:** Young-Shick Hong

**Abstract:**
Aging is associated with the degeneration of intestinal metabolism, leading to adverse effects on host metabolism. Calorie restriction (CR) is an effective intervention to delay aging, but its impact on intestinal metabolites in aged models is not well understood. We investigated the metabolic effects of 40% CR in various intestinal tissues and feces in an aged rat model using a 1H NMR-based metabolomics approach. Fecal acetate levels in CR mice were significantly increased compared to control mice, indicating alterations in gut microbiota composition under CR conditions. Additionally, metabolic perturbations related to nucleotide metabolism, osmoregulation, oxidative stress, and bile acid metabolism were observed in the intestinal tissues of CR mice. These metabolic features suggest that CR contributes to the improvement of intestinal dysfunction caused by aging.

**P-17: A Single Tissue Section Analysis Using DESI-MSI and Laser Capture Microdissection for Multimodal Cancer Research**
- **Presenting Author:** Emine Kazanc, Imperial College of London, United Kingdom

**Abstract:**
Using clinical specimens for multiple approaches, including desorption electrospray ionisation (DESI-MSI) and transcriptomics, can be challenging due to the need for more adjacent sections. A multimodal approach on a single slide would allow the co-registration of different types of information, providing a comprehensive understanding of molecular characteristics in diseases, particularly cancer. This combined analysis requires a short DESI-MSI run time to prevent RNA degradation at room temperature. The isolated RNA must be of sufficient quality for qPCR and RNA sequencing. Clinical samples were obtained from the Imperial College Tissue Bank. Tissues from ovarian cancer patients were cryosectioned at 10 µm. DESI-MSI spectra were collected, and the same sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin under RNase-free conditions. Regions of interest were microdissected using Laser Capture Microdissection (Leica 7000), and RNA was isolated. RNA quality control was performed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Preliminary results showed slightly less RNA in DESI-MSI-analyzed slides compared to non-analyzed slides, possibly due to RNA degradation at room temperature. The RNA Integrity Number (RIN) was measured to evaluate RNA degradation. The Agilent results indicated that the RNA quality was sufficient for downstream analysis to identify gene expression related to the metabolic profiling by DESI-MSI.

**P-18: Adipocyte-Induced Metabolic Changes in HER2-Positive Cancer Cells: Understanding Breast Cancer Resistance to Targeted Therapies**
- **Presenting Author:** Manhal Mili, Institute of Analytical Sciences, France

**Abstract:**
Targeted therapies have revolutionized the management of HER2-positive breast cancer, a highly invasive form of cancer that responds poorly to conventional chemotherapy. However, resistance to treatment occurs in 25-60% of patients, presenting a new therapeutic challenge. Adipocytes have been shown to decrease the sensitivity of HER2+ cells to targeted therapy (monoclonal antibody trastuzumab) in co-culture. Adding a lipolysis stimulator (isoprenaline, a beta-adrenoreceptor agonist) further decreased the response of HER2+ cancer cells to trastuzumab, while adding a lipolysis inhibitor (beta-blocker propranolol) rescued the response. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we conducted a detailed pharmaco-metabolomic investigation of adipocyte and HER2+ cancer cell co-cultures, with or without propranolol and isoprenaline. 1H 800 MHz NMR profiles were recorded to quantify metabolites in the co-culture supernatants and assess the endometabolomes of adipocytes and HER2+ cancer cells. Quantitative analysis of HER2+ cell fingerprints (41 quantified metabolites) demonstrated substantial variations in metabolite concentrations in the presence of propranolol or isoprenaline, notably succinate and glycerol. Propranolol and isoprenaline also induced changes in adipocytes, affecting the concentrations of UDP-glucose, 1-methylnicotinamide, and several amino acids. These results suggest a broad impact of adipocytes on HER2+ cell metabolism. Our metabolomics investigation provides new insights into how pharmacological modulation of lipolysis via beta-adrenoreceptors affects HER2+ cancer cell metabolism.

**P-19: NMR-Based Metabolomics in Real-Time Monitoring of Treatment-Induced Toxicity in Head and Neck Cancer and Influence of Individual Genetic Profile**

**Abstract:**
The standard treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is radio-/chemoradiotherapy (RT/CHRT), which is associated with significant toxic side effects in normal tissue and involved regions (acute radiation sequelae, ARS). This study aimed to investigate real-time dynamic changes in the serum metabolome during RT/CHRT in HNSCC patients to identify biomarkers of early ARS and their association with selected genetic variants affecting treatment response. The study included 220 patients (aged 22-80 years) treated for hypopharynx, larynx, nasopharynx, and oropharynx cancers. Blood serum samples were collected weekly from the day before treatment until RT/CHRT completion. 1H NMR spectra were acquired using a Bruker 400.13MHz spectrometer (NOESY, CPMG, diffusion edited, and J-resolved sequences). Genetic polymorphisms were detected using PCR-RFLP or TaqMan probes. Data were analyzed using SIMCA (principal component analysis, partial least squares – discriminant analysis) and STATISTICA software. We identified a group of outlying patients with a massive increase in signals from ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate, acetone, acetoacetate), which correlated with severe functional and morphological ARS. Furthermore, NBS1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms were significantly associated with different disturbances in the serum metabolome and ARS severity, impacting energy metabolism and inflammation. Real-time molecular monitoring during RT/CHRT could be beneficial for early detection of patients with poor treatment tolerance.

**Abstract:**
Biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa) recurrence are essential for better management and follow-up of radiotherapy patients. Up-regulation of TOP2A and EZH2 has been linked to a more aggressive disease in radical prostatectomy (RP) patients. Low tissue levels of citrate and spermine have also been associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR, PSA≥0.2 ng/ml) in RP patients. This study aimed to investigate the potential of gene expression and MR tissue metabolites as biomarkers for BCR in transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsies of PCa radiotherapy patients prior to treatment (n=172 samples). TOP2A and EZH2 expression were assessed using immunohistochemistry, and high-resolution magic angle spinning MR spectroscopy was performed to measure metabolites in the same TRUS biopsy. In cancer patient samples without hormone treatment, concurrent up-regulation of TOP2A and EZH2 was identified as a predictor of BCR among PCa radiotherapy patients (n=31, p=0.0079). Lower levels of citrate (p=0.0037) and polyamines (p=0.0057) were also predictive. The combination of TOP2A and EZH2, along with significantly lower levels of either citrate or polyamines in cancer samples, was confirmed as a potential biomarker for BCR among radiotherapy patients in TRUS biopsies collected prior to treatment (n=6, p=0.00027, p<0.0001 respectively). In conclusion, the combination of TOP2A and EZH2, MR metabolites citrate and polyamines, is suggested as a biomarker for BCR in PCa radiotherapy patients not receiving neoadjuvant hormonal treatment. This study offers translational potential for detecting metabolites using in vivo MR spectroscopic imaging.

**P-21: Urinary GC-MS Untargeted Metabolomics for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Preliminary Results**
- **Presenting Author:** Eleonora Amante, Università degli Studi di Torino, Italy
- **Co-Authors:** Alessandra Biancolillo, Rasmus Bro, Francesco Porpiglia, Alberto Salomone, Marco Vincenti

**Abstract:**
Prostate carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related death in men. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is currently the only clinical test available for screening, but it is highly sensitive yet not specific enough for malignancy, leading to many false positives. New biomarkers are needed to improve the diagnostic power of prostate screenings. This preliminary study aimed to discover new urinary biomarkers for prostate cancer. Ninety subjects, divided into controls and prostate carcinoma-affected, were recruited. Two aliquots of each sample were treated as follows: proteins were precipitated, and two subsequent extractions (at acidic and basic conditions) were performed for each aliquot. The dried extracts were derivatized using trifluoroacetic anhydride (aliquot A) and trimethylsilyl derivatizing mixture (aliquot B). Full-SCAN GC-MS spectra (two per sample) were processed using a double warping algorithm for alignment, spectral deconvolution using the PARADISe software based on the PARAFAC2 algorithm, and semiquantitative reports. Variable selection was performed using Variable Importance Projection and Covariance Selection algorithms. The reduced datasets were used to build two classification models, and their performances were compared. Validation was performed using repeated double cross-validation, and the preliminary results are promising, with specificity and sensitivity scores near 90%.

**Abstract:**
Metabolomic profiles reflect the combined influence of genetic and lifestyle factors in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Few prospective studies have conducted metabolome-wide association analyses of pre-diagnostic plasma in CRC risk. We conducted a nested case-control study among 32,786 women (Nurses’ Health Study [NHS]) and 18,159 men (Health Professionals Follow-up Study [HPFS]) who provided blood (~60% fasting) between 1989-95. Over a 17-year follow-up period, we documented 665 incident CRC cases (409 in NHS, 256 in HPFS), matched 1:1 to 665 controls based on cohort, age, race, time of collection, and fasting status. Metabolomic profiling using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identified 530 known plasma metabolites. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was used to obtain modules of interconnected molecules with high topological overlap. Logistic regression was used for association analyses, and multiple comparisons correction was performed using α-threshold P<8.5x10-4. Significant associations with CRC risk were observed for five metabolites, including C58:7-TAG (OR=0.81, P=6.6x10-4) in all participants, myristoleic acid (OR=1.32, P=4.3x10-4) in women, and N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (OR=1.61, P=4.8x10-4) in men. Associations were stronger in fasting samples. Among WGCNA-derived modules, the nucleic acid module was associated with CRC in men (P=0.010), and the carnitine module was associated in all participants (P=0.013). We identified pre-diagnostic metabolites associated with CRC in three groups: acylglycerols, purines, and ω-5-fatty acids, with distinct profiles in men compared to women. These results provide insight into the etiopathogenesis of CRC and have implications for risk prediction and novel prevention strategies.

**Abstract:**
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common malignancy in men. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most frequently used biomarker for PCa screening, but due to its limitations, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against PSA screening. The analysis of volatile compounds emanating from biological samples is a promising approach for finding new effective diagnostic markers for PCa. This study aimed to investigate the urinary volatile metabolic profile of patients with PCa (n=40) and non-cancer controls (n=42) to identify a potential urinary volatile pattern as a non-invasive strategy to detect PCa. A metabolomics approach based on headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was used to investigate volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and, more specifically, volatile carbonyl compounds (VCCs) in urine samples. A panel of 30 volatile compounds descriptive of PCa was defined, capable of discriminating PCa patients from controls. An external validation set (n=18 PCa and n=18 non-cancer controls) was used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the defined panel. The results revealed that the panel of 30 volatiles perfectly predicted PCa, with 100% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Overall, our results disclose a biomarker panel with the potential to be used in the clinic for PCa diagnosis.

**Abstract:**
Metabolomics profiles may offer improved insights into the etiology and system of factors involved in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumorigenesis. We conducted an untargeted analysis of 554 known metabolites measured in pre-diagnostic serum (up to 24 years) to determine their association with incident PDAC in a nested-case control study of male smokers (373 matched case-control sets) and replicated the findings in an independent nested-case control study that included women and non-smokers (107 matched sets). Controls were matched to cases by age, sex, race, date of blood draw, and follow-up time. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for a 1 standard deviation increase in log-metabolite level separately in each cohort, and the ORs were combined using a fixed-effects meta-analysis. Thirty-one metabolites were significantly associated with PDAC at an FDR < 0.05, with 12 metabolites below the Bonferroni-corrected threshold (P-value < 9.04 x 10-5). Similar associations were observed in both cohorts. The dipeptides glycylvaline, aspartylphenylalanine, pyroglutamylglycine, phenylalanylphenylalanine, phenylalanylleucine, and tryptophylglutamate, and the amino acids aspartate and glutamate, were positively associated with PDAC. The dipeptides tyrosylglutamine and α-glutamyltyrosine, fibrinogen cleavage peptide DSGEGDFXAEGGGVR, and the glutathione-related amino acid cysteine-glutathione disulfide were inversely associated with PDAC after Bonferroni correction. Five top metabolites demonstrated significant time-varying associations (P-value < 0.023), with associations becoming attenuated 10-15 years after participants' blood collection. Our results demonstrate that pre-diagnostic metabolites related to subclinical disease, glutathione metabolism, and adiposity/insulin resistance are associated with PDAC.

**P-25: Exploratory Metabolomics of Urine and Plasma to Identify Novel Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers in a Phase I Clinical Trial of AZD3965**

**Abstract:**
A key metabolic alteration in tumor cells is increased dependency on glycolysis, resulting in the production of lactate, which is transported out of cells by monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1 & MCT4). Current literature suggests that inhibition of MCT1 in preclinical models can constrain cancer cell growth in tumors with low MCT4 expression. The systemic pharmacodynamic effects of the small-molecule non-competitive inhibitor of MCT1, AZD3965, have not been fully characterized. Preclinical metabolomics studies at Imperial College London indicated that AZD3965 exposure caused increases in lactate, ketone bodies (also MCT1 substrates), and citrate in blood plasma and urine, independently of tumor burden and MCT1 expression, and decreases in fatty acids in blood plasma. We used NMR spectroscopy of urine and plasma samples from 34 patients in the first-in-class (FIC) trial CRUKD12/004 to monitor lactate and other ketone bodies. A metabolomics screen using a well-validated LC-MS/MS protocol (Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit) was also performed on plasma. The metabolomics profile of plasma and urine appears to reflect the response to AZD3965 treatment, with total urinary excretion of lactate and ketone bodies offering proof of target engagement. This effect is not mirrored in plasma, suggesting a primarily renal effect. Observed systemic metabolic effects of AZD3965 exposure appear to lessen with repeated dosing, indicating a rapid adaptive response. The metabolomics profile can provide insights into the mechanism of drug toxicity.

- **Presenting Author:** David Gaul, Georgia Institute of Technology, United States

**Abstract:**
Up to 50% of prostate cancer surgical patients experience biochemical recurrence, manifested by detectable serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels even after prostate removal. Limited pre-operative information hinders adequate prognosis, and more clinical data are needed to improve prognosis. New biomarkers can be derived from metabolome analysis of patient serum to aid physicians and patients in developing a treatment plan. We applied a multiplatform (NMR + LC−MS) metabolomics approach to study preoperative metabolic alterations associated with prostate cancer recurrence. Correlation analysis of serum metabolite abundances from prostate cancer patients (n = 40 remission vs. n = 40 recurrence) showed significant alterations in several pathways, including amino acid metabolism, purine and pyrimidine synthesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, tryptophan catabolism, glucose, and lactate. Higher lipid abundances were observed in the serum from recurrent patients for several classes, including triglycerides, lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols, diglycerides, acyl carnitines, and ceramides. Machine learning approaches led to the selection of a 20-metabolite panel from a single preoperative blood sample, enabling prediction of recurrence with 92.6% accuracy, 94.4% sensitivity, and 91.9% specificity under cross-validation conditions.
