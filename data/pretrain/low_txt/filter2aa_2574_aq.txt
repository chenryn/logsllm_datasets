#### Downloading Flash Videos, Icons, and Other Images Using Firefox
Some websites, like www.DarknessGate.com, protect multimedia content by disabling selection and right-click. Many websites still use Flash videos (SWF files) to display animations. To download SWF files and other multimedia files when right-click is disabled, follow these steps using the Firefox browser:
1. Go to the Firefox menu, select "Tools," and then "Page Info."
2. Go to the "Media" tab and locate your SWF file or the images you want to download.
3. Select the file and click the "Save As" button (see Figure 4-28).

**Note:** We do not promote breaching copyright laws regarding downloading multimedia content from the internet. However, you may need such techniques in some contexts. Always read a websiteâ€™s "Terms of Use" and regulations and obey the copyright laws announced for each site before collecting any material online.

#### Reverse Image Search
A reverse image search uses a sample image instead of a search query. It works by uploading an image or inserting its URL into a reverse image search engine, which will find where else this image appears online and display all the other locations. This helps in identifying the original source of photographs, memes, and profile pictures. The following are popular reverse image search engines:
- **Google Reverse Search (https://www.google.com/imghp)**: Paste the image URL or upload it to Google.
- **Karmadecay (http://karmadecay.com)**: A reverse image search on Reddit.com (in beta).
- **TinEye (https://www.tineye.com)**: Search by image or URL; over 24 billion images indexed.
- **Reverse Image Search (https://www.reverse-image-search.com)**: Conduct a reverse image search with Google, Bing, and Yandex.
- **ImageBrief (https://www.imagebrief.com)**: Search for images and use reverse image searches.
- **CamFind App (https://camfindapp.com)**: An app available for Android and Apple devices that uses visual search technology to recognize uploaded pictures.
- **Image Identification Project (https://www.imageidentify.com)**: Uses visual search technology to recognize uploaded images.

#### Image Manipulation Check
OSINT multimedia searches intersect many areas of the digital forensics field. As an online investigator, you should not trust all the multimedia files you acquire. If you are in doubt about any multimedia file (image or video), check carefully to ensure it has not been tampered with. Image analysis begins with identifying the source device (camera or mobile phone) used to take the photo, which is part of the image metadata.

**Metadata in Digital Files:**

- **GeoSetter (https://www.geosetter.de/en)**: Manipulate and view geodata and other metadata information of images.
- **Let's Enhance (https://letsenhance.io)**: Enhance a photo size without losing quality. The free account allows for 14 images, but privacy concerns may arise from uploading files to the server.

#### OCR Tools
During your search, you may encounter text written inside images. Extracting this text is necessary for editing, formatting, indexing, searching, or translating. Popular OCR tools and web services include:
- **FreeOCR (https://www.paperfile.net/index.html)**
- **Free Online OCR (https://www.i2ocr.com)**
- **NewOCR (https://www.newocr.com)**

**Using Google Drive and Google Docs for OCR:**
1. Upload the image to your Google Drive account (you must have a Google account).
2. Right-click the uploaded image, select "Open With," and choose "Google Docs" (see Figure 4-30).
3. Google will present the uploaded image at the top of the document and create editable OCR text below it (see Figure 4-31).
