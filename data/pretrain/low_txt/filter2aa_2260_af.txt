### Urban/Metropolitan Area Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards
**January 2007**

#### Phoenix, Arizona

**Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard Summary:**
- **Governance:** Established Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

**Governance:**
- **Key Recommendation:** Consider the direct involvement of a high-level official with political and fiscal authority to champion communications interoperability across the area.
- **Action Item:** Establish a direct line of communication for the Interoperability Subcommittee to advocate with political and fiscal leaders at local and state levels.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation**
- The Phoenix UA has incorporated existing policies and procedures, such as 800 MHz shared system SOPs and mutual aid channels SOPs, into the TICP. These policies have been actively disseminated through workshops and distributed to all included organizations.
- The National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) has been in place for less than a year, indicating that the UA is still in the early stages of implementation.
- Despite the short period, NIMS/ICS procedures were successfully demonstrated during the TICP validation exercise, with minor exceptions.

**Recommendation:**
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Established Implementation**
- The Phoenix shared system is used daily, and gateways are tested three times each day to ensure familiarity.
- The TICP validation exercise successfully demonstrated the use of various types of equipment, with minor software glitches quickly resolved.
- A laminated card with a list of talk groups and radio operating instructions is used, which is considered a best practice.
- The exercise was limited to local, regional, and minimal state participants, making it difficult to assess the degree of interoperability with state and federal agencies.

**Recommendations:**
- Involve private, state, federal, and tribal agencies in training and exercises.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component in all future exercises.

**Technology Overview:**
- The Phoenix UA includes 800 MHz trunked systems and several VHF conventional channels.
- The Phoenix/Mesa system was one of the first trunked radio systems in the country to meet Project 25 (P25) standards.
- To provide interoperability between 800 MHz and VHF users, console patches and several mobile and fixed gateways are available.
- The City of Glendale is exploring the possibility of migrating onto the area's P25 system.

#### Anaheim, California (Combined with Santa Ana, California)

**Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard Summary:**
- **Governance:** Advanced Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

**Governance: Advanced Implementation**
- The Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) was created under the authority of the Orange County Operational Area.
- Existing committees, such as the 800 MHz Governance Committee and the Orange County Chiefs of Police and Sheriff’s Association, are responsible for key decisions and recommendations.
- The governance structure can serve as a model for other jurisdictions due to its breadth of local and state participation, frequency of meetings, and ability to address near-term and long-term interoperability goals.
- The UA has proactively included multiple state and federal agencies in its interoperability solution through its Countywide Coordinated Communication System.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to seek formalized participation from and coordination with state and federal agencies in governance bodies.
- Regularly update agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) to ensure appropriate agency participation.
- Identify long-term funding sources to support interoperable communications.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation**
- The policies for the use of the Orange County shared system are well-established and documented in the TICP.
- SOPs have been disseminated to all included agencies and dispatch centers.
- The use of these system SOPs was well demonstrated during the TICP validation exercise, though further development of gateway SOPs is needed.
- The UA is in the early stages of implementing NIMS/ICS, and while participants demonstrated familiarity with NIMS/ICS processes, full proficiency has not yet been established.

**Recommendations:**
- Further develop SOPs for the use of gateways.
- Regularly exercise SOPs that test various scenario-based command and control procedures.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Established Implementation**
- The Orange County UA regularly conducts multi-agency responses using its shared system.
- The TICP validation exercise participants successfully established interoperable communications.
- Broader state and federal agencies were not widely included, limiting the assessment of interoperability with these entities.

**Recommendations:**
- Expand exercises to integrate state and federal entities.
- Document additional methods to interoperate with state and federal agencies.
- Add communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

**Technology Overview:**
- Anaheim and Santa Ana public safety communications are supported by Orange County’s 800 MHz mixed-mode trunked radio system.
- All public safety agencies in the Orange County UA have talk groups on this system, which includes 81 channels with 400 talk groups and 16,000 radios.
- The next step would be to upgrade to a countywide Project 25 system.
