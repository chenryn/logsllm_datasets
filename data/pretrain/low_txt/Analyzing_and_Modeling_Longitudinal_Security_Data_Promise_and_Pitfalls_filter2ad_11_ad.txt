### Impact of Takedowns on Wickedness

In some cases, takedowns initially have a positive effect, but in the long term, wickedness (the concentration of spam-sending hosts) actually increases. A prominent example is the Czech Republic following the Bredolab/Spamit.com takedowns. While there was no significant decrease in wickedness during the week of the takedown, it nearly doubled in the six weeks that followed. Country-by-country, the global takedown effect varies. For instance, the McColo takedown saw initial success, but was followed by a global and regional increase in spam. At the country level, the results are mixed: Belarus benefited from the takedown, while Romania, Hungary, and Russia experienced increases after six weeks.

These regional results suggest that botnets may migrate in response to takedowns. By reducing the number of infected hosts in one region, takedowns create incentives for botnets to find new vulnerable hosts, thereby moving the problem elsewhere. In this work, we do not investigate this issue further; however, more advanced modeling techniques, such as vector autoregressive models [2], could provide insights into this possibility.

### Related Work

While other studies focus on specific infection mechanisms, our model considers the security problem from a global perspective, with botnets being just one component. We find that most botnet takedowns have limited and transient impacts on global wickedness. This aligns with other research, which has found that botnets are surprisingly resilient [81] and often recover after a short time [54]. Other work has modeled malicious websites, noting the high variance in cybersecurity data, and investigated interventions through modeling [13].

General traffic filtering is an important intervention for reducing the number of infected hosts. Research into the effectiveness of various filtering techniques, e.g., [45, 27, 60], focuses on the success of the filter itself rather than whether it reduces the global distribution of infected hosts. Incorporating filtering interventions into our model is an area we plan to explore in future work.

### Discussion

Data-driven models like the one presented here can yield important insights, informing policymakers about the utility of interventions or how to prepare vulnerable regions before they are applied. However, several pitfalls must be considered:

1. **Statistical Correlations vs. Mechanisms**: The model is built around statistical correlations but ignores precise mechanisms, such as how a country’s development and an ISP’s position in the ISP network influence wickedness.
2. **Causality**: Statistical models cannot determine causality, so a detailed understanding of the data is needed to attribute cause and effect.
3. **High Variance Data**: High variance data can hide significant changes or make it appear that significant change has occurred when it has not. Modeling global data is a powerful tool, but the methodology must account for variance (e.g., averages can be misleading).
4. **Data Quality**: Conclusions drawn from a statistical model depend on the quality of the data, although techniques exist to help compensate for certain classes of data problems.

Any model is necessarily a simplification of reality. For example, our traffic model is simplistic given the complexity of the Internet. Future work could incorporate more realistic models, especially since our model shows that the traffic component is significant only during the third era. It could be that spam email was more likely to be used to spread infection during this era, whereas earlier it was primarily used for advertising, e.g., gray market pharmaceuticals. Similar to the traffic component, if other important features are identified, such as the type of service provided by an ISP, this information could easily be included in the model.

This paper focused on spam, but spam data have also been used to estimate the numbers of infected PCs [83, 70, 26]. By applying our methodology to other measures of infection, it should be possible to develop models that provide insight into the dynamics and global distribution of these other types of infections.

In general, we are interested in the distribution of all malicious behavior (or wickedness), regardless of its source. In some cases, the definition of wickedness could be expanded, e.g., to include the relative value of hosts in different regions—an infected machine in the US may be more valuable than one in India.

Cybersecurity is often viewed as an arms race, complicating the task of predicting the impact of today’s interventions against tomorrow’s attackers. At least, we should evaluate the likely effect of new methods before large-scale deployments or policy directives that enforce certain interventions. Models such as the one described here can help in this regard.

We have studied the impact of botnet takedowns in detail, but other interventions would also be interesting to explore. For example, the traffic model provides a way to analyze the effect of blacklisting offending ISPs or different filtering strategies [24]. There is evidence that national and international initiatives against cybercrime can reduce wickedness [73]. Our model could be used to assess whether countries that are signatories to agreements such as the London Action Plan or Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime actually experience lower wickedness levels after ratifying the agreements. This could be studied by incorporating this information as an additional variable.

By looking for differential effects of takedowns geographically, we can identify at-risk ISPs or countries—those that are likely to see little initial effect from the takedown but could expect an increase in wickedness in the medium term. Our results to date have not identified any single factor that is consistently correlated (at a statistically significant level) with increased wickedness after a takedown. However, if we could identify at-risk countries and ISPs, they might make good candidates for targeted interventions, such as providing resources to ISPs (or even countries) that lack adequate spam-fighting resources and automated methods to help customers clean up malware. Government interventions could focus on providing resources to those ISPs, an approach that might prove more cost-effective than existing methods.

### Conclusion

With unprecedented numbers of people now connected to and depending on the Internet (three billion in 2014 [72]), it is imperative that we understand and mitigate global cybersecurity threats. Further, we need to understand regional variations and why some parts of the world and some corners of the Internet are disproportionately affected.

In this paper, we studied an abstract quantity called wickedness (concentration of spam-sending hosts) and showed that it clusters regionally, correlating with national demographics and certain properties of the ISP graph. Through the use of statistical modeling combined with a large dataset, we studied some of the factors affecting spam, a large-scale security problem distributed around the world. Leveraging a long-term historical view of data produced interesting insights about the effectiveness of certain cybersecurity interventions. We found that takedowns are only marginally effective in many cases and may even be harmful to certain countries and ISPs.

Our model could serve as a starting point to predict future wickedness and test the likely effect of new interventions, both for spam and other similar problems. Our ultimate goal is to provide researchers and policymakers with objective means to test intervention strategies and decide how best to mitigate global wickedness.
