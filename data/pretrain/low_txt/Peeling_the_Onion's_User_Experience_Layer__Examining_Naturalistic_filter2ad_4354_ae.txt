### Interview Questions

Please keep in mind that there are no incorrect answers to these questions. Any answers you provide will remain strictly confidential with access limited only to the research team unless otherwise required by law. Additionally, you may refuse to answer any question. All questions are optional.

This interview will be recorded to aid in the analysis performed by the researchers. After the interview is transcribed, the audio data will be deleted. Anonymous transcribed data will be retained indefinitely. If you wish, you can request that the recording device be disabled at any time.

- **Do you consent to the audio recording of this interview?**
- **Do you consent to the indefinite retention of the anonymous transcribed interview data?**

1. **Please describe your experience using the Tor Browser.**
2. **Please tell us about some of the issues you encountered using the Tor Browser as your default browser.**
   - Could you elaborate on the issue?
   - Did you encounter this issue more times than you reported it in the online questionnaires?
   - On which categories of Web sites did this issue occur?
   - Would this issue hinder you from using the Tor Browser in the future?
3. **Will you continue using the Tor Browser after this study? Why or why not?**
4. **In your opinion, which of the issues you encountered while using the Tor Browser caused the most confusion and/or frustration?**
5. **One issue many Tor Browser users face is long waiting times (high latency). However, this latency can be an artifact of how Tor protects your identity. Indeed, in some instances, latency and anonymity are transactional: higher latency can lead to better protection. Knowing this, are there certain tasks for which you would be willing to tolerate latency to gain anonymity?**
6. **Are there any other issues that you encountered while using the Tor Browser that you wish to report?**
7. **Is there anything else I should have asked?**

### Write-Up Prompt

Write an essay of about 2-3 single-spaced pages about your experience of using the Tor Browser as your default and primary browser for the duration of one week. Your essay should describe your positive and negative experiences with the user interface and user experience of the Tor Browser. Please provide specific examples along with respective relevant contextual details. Please include a discussion of what you learned specifically about the Tor Browser and Tor as well as generally about Web technology, anonymity, surveillance, etc. Feel free to propose creative solutions or improvements that could have helped you utilize the Tor Browser more effectively. Please also indicate whether your browsing behavior during the study period was typical of your browsing behavior at other times. If your browsing practices during the study period differed from your typical practices, please explain how and why. You may also comment on your study participation experience, such as the questionnaires prompted by the script throughout the week.
