### 5.2.2 Analysis of Leakage Components in the RX Chain

In the receive (RX) chain, two primary leakage components from the transmit (TX) signal are observed:
1. **Direct Leakage**: This occurs due to the direct path from the TX port of the circulator to the "isolated" RX port.
2. **Reflections**: These arise from impedance mismatches between the circulator and the antenna.

These two components travel different paths through the circulator, resulting in different delays as measured in the time domain. The delays are fixed and depend on the specific circulator and antenna used. In our implementation, we found that the delay for the direct leakage component is approximately 400 picoseconds, while the reflected component has a delay centered around 1.4 nanoseconds.

With 16 delay lines, we can center the first 8 lines to have delays around 400 picoseconds and the other 8 lines around 1.4 nanoseconds. By using the interpolation technique discussed in Section 3.1, we can precisely cancel both the direct and reflected self-interference components. However, with only 8 lines, our flexibility in placing the delay lines around the actual delays experienced by the self-interference is reduced, leading to a decrease in cancellation effectiveness.

### 5.2.3 Deconstructing Digital Cancellation

After achieving 62 dB of analog cancellation, digital cancellation is required to clean up the remaining 48 dB of linear and 16 dB of non-linear self-interference components. In this section, we analyze the amount of linear and non-linear cancellation achieved by our design.

To conduct this experiment, we first tune our analog cancellation circuit to provide 62 dB of cancellation. We then progressively add more components to our digital cancellation design. Initially, we implement only the "linear" digital cancellation, which targets the main self-interference components and multipath reflections from the environment. Next, we add the capability to model non-linear components, referred to as "non-linear cancellation." We calculate the cancellation achieved by these two variants of digital cancellation techniques.

For comparison with prior work, we also implement the digital cancellation technique described in the balun-based design [11]. The increase in noise floor for all techniques as a function of transmit power is plotted in Figure 12.

As shown in Figure 12, our full digital cancellation technique reduces the self-interference to the thermal noise floor. The linear digital cancellation stage alone leaves 16 dB of self-interference residue above the thermal noise floor. By modeling the non-linear harmonics, we further reduce the self-interference by 16 dB, almost eliminating the non-linear distortions. In contrast, the prior work's digital cancellation technique leaves nearly 18 dB of self-interference residue over the noise floor, as it cannot model non-linear distortions.

### 5.2.4 Dynamic Adaptation

As environmental conditions change, the level of cancellation drops because the values of the attenuators used will be off relative to the new conditions. In this section, we evaluate the time required to re-tune the analog cancellation and how often it needs to be re-tuned in an indoor environment. Note that digital cancellation is tuned on a per-packet basis, so it is not a concern. Analog cancellation must be tuned during a special period when no data is transmitted, making it important to quantify this overhead.

We conducted this experiment in a busy indoor environment with other WiFi radios and students moving around. An indoor environment is the worst-case scenario for full-duplex communication due to the presence of many reflectors near the transmitter. Outdoor LTE scenarios are less likely to have such strong near-field reflectors, making our design more easily adaptable to outdoor LTE environments.

We placed the full-duplex node and conducted analog cancellation tuning as described in Section 3.3. Specifically, we used the WiFi preamble to determine the initial settings of the attenuators to match the frequency response of the circulator and antenna. Next, we ran a gradient descent algorithm to further improve the cancellation from that initial point. Each iteration of the gradient descent consumes 92 µs, as we have 16 different directions to compute the gradient (corresponding to the 16 different attenuators). We computed the time it takes for the analog cancellation to converge. We repeated this experiment several times for different node placements and environmental conditions and plotted the average convergence time. We also conducted an experiment where we did not use the initial frequency-based tuning and only used gradient descent from a random starting point for the attenuator values. The cancellation achieved as a function of tuning time is shown on the right side of Figure 13.

As seen in the right side of Figure 13, our analog tuning converges in around 920 µs, compared to the 40 or more milliseconds it takes for a pure gradient descent-based approach. The reason is that the frequency-based initial point estimation provides a point very close to optimal, and from there, a few gradient descent iterations allow us to find the optimal point. Our cancellation algorithm tunes an order of magnitude faster than a simple gradient descent-based approach.

An important question is how often do we need to retune? Analog cancellation must be re-tuned when there is a change in the near-field reflections, as it cancels only the strong components (components 50 dB above the noise floor; farther out reflections are weaker than this 50 dB threshold). For our indoor office deployments, we found that we needed to retune once every 100 ms on average. Outdoor scenarios would require less frequent retuning due to fewer changes in the near field. We show this experimentally in Figure 13, where the left plot shows the amount of cancellation observed as a function of time after finding the optimal operating point from a large collection of different experimental runs in our testbed. We define the "near-field coherence time" of analog cancellation as the time until the receiver remains unsaturated from when it was tuned, which we also use as the trigger to rerun the tuning algorithm. As shown, the near-field coherence time for the cancellation is roughly 100 milliseconds. In other words, we have to retune the analog cancellation once every 100 milliseconds, leading to an overhead of less than 1%.

### 5.3 Does Full Duplex Double Throughput?

This section demonstrates experimentally that our design delivers close to the theoretically expected doubling of throughput for a full-duplex WiFi link. Note that this is a PHY layer experiment, and a full MAC design for full-duplex WiFi is beyond the scope of this paper.

We conducted these experiments by placing two full-duplex nodes at different locations and sending trains of 1000 packets in full-duplex mode, and then similar trains for each direction in half-duplex mode. Each train uses a particular bitrate (from WiFi), and we cycle through all the bitrates for each location. We pick the bitrate with the best overall throughput for full-duplex, two-antenna full-duplex, and half-duplex, respectively. We repeated this experiment for different locations and found that the SNRs of the links varied uniformly between 0 and 45 dB across locations, as expected in a typical indoor deployment. The CDF of the throughput for half-duplex and full-duplex links is plotted in Figure 14. All throughput numbers account for the overhead introduced by periodic analog cancellation tuning.

As shown in Figure 14, our full-duplex system achieves a median throughput gain of 1.87× over the standard half-duplex mode. The small SNR loss due to a small amount of self-interference residue, as discussed in Section 5.1.2, explains why the gain is slightly less than the theoretical 2×.

How do prior designs perform? We found that in 60% of the scenarios, the throughput with prior full-duplex techniques was zero. This is because these designs leave at least 25 dB of self-interference residue, which acts as noise. If the link SNR is below 30 dB, no signal is decoded (WiFi requires a minimum of 4-5 dB to decode even the lowest rate packet). As the half-duplex link SNR increases, performance improves but still does not surpass the throughput achieved by half-duplex. The reason is that even if the link half-duplex SNR is 35 dB, it implies that we only have two 10 dB links for full-duplex. The throughput achieved with a single 35 dB half-duplex link is still higher than two 10 dB links. Consequently, the only region where we could find improvements for full-duplex over half-duplex with prior techniques was when the link SNR was greater than 40 dB.

### 6. Discussion & Conclusion

This paper marks an important step in proving that full-duplex communication is not only possible but also feasible and practical. It can be deployed with no overhead in terms of antennas used and yet achieve the theoretical doubling of throughput. Below, we discuss the current design's limitations, potential avenues for future work, and then conclude.

**Size of Circuit**: The current analog cancellation circuit is large, with our prototype board measuring 10 × 10 cm. This design is suitable for access points (APs) and base stations, which is our initial focus. However, this design is not implementable on phones and other portable devices where size is a premium. To realize full-duplex on such devices, we need to design an RFIC that is sufficiently small (at best 20-30 sq.mm for current phones). The key consumers of space on our circuit are delay lines, which we currently realize via traces on the board. For an RFIC, we expect to use different techniques to achieve the same delays, such as LC ladders and acoustic technologies like SAW and BAW [12]. These techniques operate by slowing the speed of light, thus obtaining true time delays in very short form factors. However, this discussion is speculative and part of our future work.

**LTE**: Our current prototype targets WiFi frequencies in the 2.4 GHz band. However, our prototype can also be used for the 2.3 GHz and 2.5 GHz LTE bands found in Asia and Europe. The general design of our system is frequency-independent, with the dependence in our prototype coming from the fact that several analog components in our cancellation board work only in specific frequency ranges (our tunable attenuators operate only between 2-2.6 GHz). The same design can be used for different frequencies with corresponding components that work in those frequency ranges. Unlike WiFi, LTE uses smaller channels, with the widest channel being 20 MHz, making the cancellation problem somewhat simpler. Therefore, we believe our current design can be adapted to work with LTE, and this remains future work.

**MIMO**: The current design targets single-input, single-output (SISO) scenarios. For multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO), we could use the same design, but a key challenge is that the crosstalk between different antennas also needs to be canceled in analog. Hence, an analog cancellation circuit must be designed to model not just the distortions through a circulator and a single antenna but also the distortions that occur when signals travel across antennas. Designing an efficient, space-compact circuit for this problem is part of our current research focus.

Finally, we would like to comment that full-duplex radio design is a problem that spans three different research areas: RF circuit and system design, digital signal processing, and networking. The problem cannot be solved in any one domain alone; the solution, in our opinion, requires understanding trade-offs across all these domains and architecting it appropriately. Historically, these communities have been separate, with RF system designers expecting baseband IQ samples as the interface and viewing their job as sending and receiving signals in RF from these baseband IQ samples. DSP designers view their job as converting between bits and IQ samples efficiently in the presence of noise. Finally, networking researchers transact in bits and packets and design medium access while abstracting out the underlying details. Realizing and taking advantage of full-duplex requires research that spans across these domains, and this work represents a step in that direction.
