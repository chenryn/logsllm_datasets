### Figure 21: Loss Rate for Broadcast Packets vs. Link Throughput and P_Berr for All Station Pairs

Given the observations from the above figure, we further investigate the retransmission mechanism in relation to link quality using unicast traffic. We now examine the retransmissions of Powerline Communication (PLC) packets by sending unicast traffic at a low data rate (i.e., 150 Kbps) and capturing the PLC frame headers. In this scenario, an Ethernet packet of 1500 bytes is sent approximately every 75 ms, and the test duration is 5 minutes per link.

Broadcast packets may be missed by some stations under poor channel conditions because they are not retransmitted once acknowledged by a proxy station. In contrast, unicast packets are retransmitted until the receiver acknowledges them, ensuring their successful delivery. To study retransmissions, we analyze the Start of Frame (SoF) in the frame header. Since there is no explicit indication of retransmissions in the PLC SoF, we use the arrival timestamp of the frame to determine whether it is a retransmission or a new transmission. If the frame arrives within 10 ms of the previous frame, it is considered a retransmission. Additionally, we measure the bit error rate (P_Berr) every 500 ms.

### Figure 22: U-ETX vs. BLE and U-ETX vs. P_Berr

We conduct the experiment described above for all links in our testbed and compute the unicast Expected Transmission Count (U-ETX) for each link. We count the total number of retransmissions for a 1500-byte packet, which generates three PLC blocks (PBs). A retransmission occurs if at least one of these PBs is received with errors. Figure 22 shows U-ETX as a function of average Bit Loading Efficiency (BLE) and P_Berr. U-ETX is measured by averaging the number of PLC retransmissions for all packets transmitted during the experiment. The standard deviation of the transmission count is also plotted. Our findings indicate that link quality is negatively correlated with link variability, consistent with the conclusions drawn in Section 6.2. Higher U-ETX values correspond to higher standard deviations in the transmission count. Links with high BLE are likely to guarantee low delays, as U-ETX remains relatively stable. U-ETX and the averaged P_Berr show a strong, nearly linear correlation.

### 8.2 Retransmission Due to Contention

To explore the sensitivity of link metrics to background traffic and to examine how interference can be factored into link metrics, we experiment with two contending flows. We set a link to send unicast traffic at 150 Kbps, emulating probe packets. After 200 seconds, we activate a second link sending "background" traffic at various rates. We measure both BLE and P_Berr.

Our experiments show that BLE is insensitive to low data-rate background traffic for all pairs of links. However, BLE is affected by high data-rate background traffic on a few pairs of links. We have not yet found any specific correlation between these pairs of links. This phenomenon can be explained by the "capture effect," where the best link decodes a few PBs even during a collision due to very good channel conditions, resulting in high P_Berr. In such cases, the channel-estimation algorithm cannot distinguish between errors due to physical layer issues and those due to collisions, leading to a decrease in BLE. Figure 23 presents two representative examples of link pairs for which BLE is sensitive and insensitive to high data-rate background traffic. Notice that P_Berr significantly increases in link 6-11, which is sensitive to background traffic.

To address the sensitivity of BLE to high data-rate background traffic, we leverage the frame aggregation procedure of the MAC layer, as described in Section 2.2. We observe that transmitting a few PBs every 75 ms (at a 150 Kbps rate) makes the metrics sensitive to background traffic. When two saturated flows are activated, we do not observe any effect on BLE. Due to frame aggregation, packets from different saturated flows have approximately the same frame length (i.e., maximum), and when they collide, the channel estimation algorithm works more efficiently than when short probe-packets collide with long ones. To emulate the long frame lengths of saturated traffic, we send bursts of 20 packets, maintaining the same traffic rate per second (i.e., 150 Kbps).

Figure 24 shows another link for which BLE is sensitive to background traffic and the results of our solution. By sending bursts of probe packets, BLE is no longer affected by background traffic. This demonstrates that by exploiting the frame aggregation process, we can mitigate the sensitivity of link metrics to background traffic.

### Conclusion

We have studied the retransmission mechanism in PLC. While broadcast probe-packets yield significantly less overhead in link-quality estimation, they do not provide accurate estimations. In contrast, unicast probe-packets reflect the real link quality but produce more overhead. We observe that P_Berr can be used to estimate U-ETX and indicate interference in PLC. However, estimating the amount of interference remains challenging and requires further investigation. We introduce techniques to address the potential sensitivity of link metrics to background traffic.

### 9. LINK-METRIC GUIDELINES

We summarize our guidelines for efficient link-metric estimation with PLC based on our experimental study:

| Policy | Metrics | Guideline/Explanation |
|--------|---------|-----------------------|
| Unicast probing only | BLE and P_Berr, defined by IEEE 1901 | Broadcast probing cannot be used, as it does not provide information on link quality. |
| Shortest time-scale | BLE | Should be averaged over the mains cycle. |
| Size of probes | Larger than one PB (or one OFDM symbol) | To avoid inaccurate convergence of the rate adaptation algorithm. |
| Frequency of probes | Adapted to link quality | For lower overhead. |
| Burstiness of probes | Can tackle potential inaccurate convergence of the channel estimation algorithm or the sensitivity of link metrics to background traffic. |
| Asymmetry in probing | Both spatial and temporal variation asymmetry in PLC links | This could affect bidirectional traffic, such as TCP, that requires routing in both directions. |

### 10. RELATED WORK

A significant body of work focuses on channel modeling and noise analysis, with limited research on PLC performance from an end-user perspective. For example, [13] explores the performance of HomePlug AV when household devices operate in the network, observing that switching appliances significantly affects performance and introduces asymmetry. Liu et al. [12] investigate the interoperability and coexistence of different HomePlug AV networks and propose a scheme to improve the performance of multiple contending AV networks.

Many experimental studies focus on the PLC MAC layer under single contention domain scenarios and ideal channel conditions. Zarikoﬀ and Malone [22] provide guidelines for constructing a PLC testbed and perform measurements with both UDP and TCP traffic and multiple contending flows. We [21] study the fairness of the CSMA/CA protocol both analytically and experimentally, showing that the 1901 MAC is unfair and can result in high jitter under certain conditions.

Some works compare the performance of wireless and PLC networks. [11] investigates older specifications of PLC and WiFi, providing testbed measurements from 20 houses. [17] compares hybrid PLC/WiFi networks with single-technology networks, finding that hybrid networks increase coverage in home networks. However, they do not study link metrics that can optimize routing in such networks.

### 11. CONCLUSION

We have shown that PLC can yield significant performance gains when combined with WiFi networks. However, there were open questions on how to fully exploit both mediums, and PLC has received limited attention from the research community. We introduce an experimental framework and investigate the performance of PLC, exploring its spatial and temporal variations. We have studied PLC link metrics and their variation with respect to space, time, and background traffic. We provide guidelines for efficient metric-estimation in hybrid implementations and observe a high correlation between link quality and its variability, which impacts probing overhead and accurate estimations.
