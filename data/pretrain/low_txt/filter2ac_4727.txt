**Title: Back in Black Hat: The 7th Annual Black Hat USA NOC Report**

After a brief hiatus, the Black Hat Network Operations Center (NOC) team is back with an event that promises to be unlike any other. As the world continues to embrace virtual and hybrid formats, Black Hat is no exception. Join us as we share our experiences over the past two years, detailing how we have adapted, evolved, and prepared for an event that combines in-person and virtual elements.

We will delve into the technologies and strategies we are employing to stabilize and secure one of the most high-profile networks in the world. Our discussion will cover both the successes and the challenges we encountered, along with the lessons learned along the way. In true Las Vegas fashion, the stakes are high, the outcomes are uncertain, and we are committed to sharing every insight and experience, no matter the outcome.

Join us for an engaging and informative session that will provide valuable insights into the complexities and rewards of managing a hybrid event network.
