## Abstract
Many computer security defenses are reactive, only activating during or immediately after a security incident. Recent efforts have aimed to predict security incidents before they occur, enabling proactive protection of devices and networks. These efforts have primarily focused on long-term predictions. We propose a system that enables proactive defenses at the level of a single browsing session. By observing user behavior, it can predict whether a user will be exposed to malicious content on the web seconds before the exposure, thus providing an opportunity for proactive defenses. We evaluate our system using three months of HTTP traffic data from 20,645 users of a large cellular provider in 2017, demonstrating its effectiveness even at very low false positive rates. Additionally, we conduct surveys to assess the utility of self-reported data in predicting exposure to malicious content. Our findings indicate that while self-reported data can help forecast exposure risk over long periods, behavioral measurements are more crucial for accurate short-term predictions.

## Introduction
John typically uses his mobile device to browse news websites, read and post social media updates, and check his web mail. Today, however, he wants to watch a soccer game. His TV subscription does not include a streaming option for the relevant channel, so he searches for a free streaming website. Despite warnings from his mobile browser, John proceeds and eventually finds a streaming site. Unfortunately, this site is used to distribute malware, and John's phone gets compromised. Over the following week, he loses access to his email account, receives invoices for premium calls, and finds that funds are missing from his bank account.

Could this have been avoided? Traditionally, mobile users rely on blacklists and anti-virus software for protection. However, these tools have limitations: they can produce false positives and negatives, and they cannot protect users until a site is confirmed as malicious and added to a blacklist. Attackers thus have a "window of opportunity" between the deployment of a malicious site and its inclusion in a blacklist. Further, determined users may ignore warnings.

A better approach might have been to observe that John's behavior before his phone was infected was different from his usual patterns. On that day, he was quickly browsing through many pages, some in languages he did not speak, spending little time on each page, and downloading numerous advertisements. These could have been indicators of risky behavior.

We propose a proactive system that predicts if user behavior may lead to exposure to malicious content ahead of time (e.g., 30 seconds before exposure). This allows for various interventions to prevent compromise, such as rate limiting, warnings, or connection termination, depending on the service provider's desired level of aggressiveness. We focus on mobile users and leverage a combination of web observations and surveys from a large mobile service provider to build our predictive engine. Our system uses self-reported data about users' security behavior, past behavioral observations, and contextual features about users' browsing sessions to predict if they will be exposed to malicious content.

### Contributions
- **Documentation of Exposure Levels:** Using three months of data from over 20,600 users, we document the level of exposure to online malice, showing that at least 11% of users get exposed at some point.
- **Limitations of Blacklisting:** We demonstrate the limitations of webpage blacklisting, finding that malicious pages are frequently accessed before being blacklisted.
- **Browsing Patterns Analysis:** Our measurements show clear differences in browsing patterns between users exposed to malicious pages and those who are not.
- **Survey Data Analysis:** By surveying users, we build a logistic regression model to estimate the extent to which self-reported data can provide meaningful indicators of risk exposure over time.
- **Long-Term Prediction Model:** We design a long-term predictive classifier to determine the risk of exposure to malice for a given user over a month's horizon.
- **Short-Term Prediction Model:** We combine our knowledge to design a short-term classifier that can predict exposure to a malicious page within 30 seconds with reasonable accuracy.
- **False Positive Analysis:** We show that many "false positives" are actually true positives, and that the blacklists we used for evaluation only learned about these sites days after user exposure.

### Related Work
Our research intersects four areas: measurement studies of mobile malware, systems research beyond blacklisting, security-incident prediction, and human factors in security.

- **Prevalence of Mobile Malware:** Estimates of malware prevalence vary widely, with some studies suggesting that up to 80% of malware samples are repackaged versions of legitimate software.
- **Protecting Systems and Networks:** Many alternatives to blacklists and anti-viruses have been proposed, but they often intervene only at or shortly after the time of exposure.
- **Predicting Security Incidents:** Prior work has explored the feasibility of predicting future security incidents, but our focus is on short-term predictions (seconds rather than days or months) to enable rapid intervention.
- **Human Factors Affecting Security:** Studies have shown that human behavior plays a significant role in security, and we complement system-level measurements with self-reported survey data to estimate correlations between posited and actual user behavior.

### Data Collection
We worked with KDDI, a large Japanese mobile Internet service provider, to collect data from 20,895 distinct users. Users who opted-in consented to the logging of their HTTP accesses over the cellular network. We also conducted a research survey to pair survey responses with HTTP activity logs. The data collected reflects the nature of users' behavior and has high visibility to malicious traffic. While the democratization of HTTPS may increase the popularity of serving malicious content over HTTPS, our methods can be adapted by using domain information only. Ethical considerations were addressed in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon’s Internal Review Board (IRB) and KDDI’s legal team.
