## 180115 (v.2.9.*)
### Feature Updates
- **Renaming of DevOps Kit PowerShell Module:**
  The module will be renamed from 'AzSDK' to 'AzSK' in a future release. As an initial step, aliases have been introduced for the commands. Existing command names will continue to function as usual for the time being.

- **Continuous Assurance (CA) Enhancements:**
  - CA can now be configured to send events to two different OMS workspaces, enabling service groups to use a common workspace for monitoring CA status across multiple subscriptions while individual DevOps teams can still use their own workspaces.
  - Support has been added for specifying a webhook during CA setup, facilitating downstream extensibility scenarios.
  - The CA scan interval is now configurable at both the organizational and individual setup levels. The default interval remains 24 hours.
  - The parallel-CA scanning feature has been improved to:
    - Append to existing target subscriptions.
    - Implement central logging with the subscription ID as the parent folder.
    - Make `Get-CA` aware of the central-scan mode, providing information on central scanning setups.
  - For more details, refer to [Setting Up Continuous Assurance](https://azsk.azurewebsites.net/04-Continous-Assurance/Readme.html#setting-up-continuous-assurance---step-by-step).

- **OMS Improvements:**
  - If local OMS settings are not explicitly configured, local scans will attempt to use the OMS settings from the CA configuration for the subscription, reducing the need for individual configurations.

- **Compliant ARM Templates (Preview):**
  - We are introducing ARM templates for various resources that can serve as references when creating your own templates. These "compliant" templates have passed applicable AzSDK controls for the corresponding resources. Early adopters and feedback are welcome. You can download these templates from [http://aka.ms/azsk/armtemplates](http://aka.ms/azsk/armtemplates).

- **ARM Template Checker (Preview):**
  - A VSTS extension has been developed to run the DevOps Kit ARM Template Checker in the CICD pipeline. This allows for direct scanning of ARM templates, as opposed to the default AzSDK scanning against deployed resources. The extension can prevent the creation of non-compliant ARM resources. For more information, see [ARM Template Checker](https://azsk.azurewebsites.net/03-Security-In-CICD/Readme.html#azsk-arm-template-checker).

### Other Improvements and Bug Fixes
- **SVTs:**
  - Subscription and Resource Scan checks now include a lightweight "is CA correctly set up?" check at the start of the command.
  - A regression in the `-GenerateFixScript` feature has been fixed.

- **Controls:**
  - New controls have been added for App Service, Key Vault, and Storage, based on recent feature improvements from the product team.
  - An issue with the RDP-related control check in CloudService SVT has been resolved.
  - Two controls have been removed from Storage: (a) GRS and (b) alerts for anonymous access. We are working with the product group to clarify these points.
  - A new ARM policy has been introduced to support denying the creation of classic resources. For more information, see [ARM Policy List](https://azsk.azurewebsites.net/02-Secure-Development/ControlCoverage/Feature/ARMPolicyList.html).

- **Get-AzSDKInfo Command:**
  - User experience (UX) improvements have been made for various queries (e.g., ControlInfo, BasicInfo).
  - A performance issue with the AttestationInfo option has been fixed.

- **Attestation:**
  - Several issues have been addressed where, in the absence of additional constraints or checks, an attestation was applying to a broader scope than intended.

- **Continuous Assurance (CA):**
  - `Get-CA` now checks if the runbook version is up to date and warns if there are resource locks on `AzSDKRG`.

- **CICD:**
  - A workaround has been implemented for a product group (PG) issue in our CICD extension that caused SAS-token-based policy access to fail.
