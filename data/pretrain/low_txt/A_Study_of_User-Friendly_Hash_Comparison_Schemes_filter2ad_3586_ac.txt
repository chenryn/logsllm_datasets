# Base32 and Other Schemes: Performance and Usability Analysis

## Introduction
This document evaluates various hash comparison schemes, including Base32, Chinese characters, English words, Flag Extension, Japanese characters, Korean characters, Flag, Random Art, and T-Flag.

## Additional Benefits
- **Describability:** A scheme is describable if users can clearly describe the representation without showing it to another user.
  - **Base32 and English Words:** Easily spelled using letters and numbers.
  - **Random Art:** Difficult to describe accurately due to color gradients and varying bar widths.
  - **T-Flag and Flag Extension:** Colors, shapes, and order can be described.
  - **Flag:** Minor variations in colors may be difficult to describe without knowledge of RGB values.
  - **Asian Characters:** Users familiar with the language can speak the characters, but others may struggle.

## Limited Entropy of Hash Comparison Schemes
- Each scheme represents a hash with around 20-30 bits of entropy.
- An attacker needs to break the second-preimage resistance of the hash representation.
- Increasing entropy sacrifices usability and accuracy.
- Using commitments or other techniques ensures security by making inputs unpredictable and preventing modifications.

## Conclusion
- **Best Balanced Schemes:** Base32, Random Art, T-Flag, and Flag Extension.
- **Decision Tree:** Based on device capabilities (high-resolution display, sufficient computation power), the decision tree suggests the most suitable visual comparison schemes.
