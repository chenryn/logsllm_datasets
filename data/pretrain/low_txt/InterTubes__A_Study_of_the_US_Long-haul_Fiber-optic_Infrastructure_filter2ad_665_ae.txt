# 8. Summary and Future Work

In this paper, we examine the long-haul fiber-optic infrastructure of the Internet in the United States. Our primary contributions are threefold:

1. **Mapping Infrastructure**: We have created a first-of-its-kind map of the long-haul fiber-optic infrastructure using openly available data from tier-1 ISPs and cable providers. The map's accuracy has been rigorously validated through various public information sources, including government filings, environmental impact statements, and press releases. Our analysis confirms a strong correlation between fiber deployments and existing road and rail infrastructure, and reveals significant link sharing among providers.

2. **Risk Analysis**: We apply different metrics to evaluate the issue of shared risk in the long-haul fiber-optic network. Our findings highlight high-risk links where there is substantial sharing among service providers, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities in the network.

3. **Identifying Opportunities for Improvement**: We identify public rights-of-way (ROWs) that could be targeted for new link conduits, thereby reducing shared risk and enhancing path performance. Our findings contribute to the broader discussion on Title II regulations and net neutrality, providing insights into the physical infrastructure that underpins these policies.

### Future Work
In future research, we plan to enhance the coverage and accuracy of our long-haul map by incorporating regional and metro fiber maps. Additionally, we aim to continue the process of validating the links and generate annotated versions of the map, with a particular focus on traffic and propagation delay.
