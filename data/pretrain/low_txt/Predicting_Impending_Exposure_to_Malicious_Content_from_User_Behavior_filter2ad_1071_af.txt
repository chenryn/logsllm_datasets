## User Survey

### Introduction
Below are the questions that were asked of our 23,419 survey participants (beyond demographic questions and consent). These questions are English translations of the original Japanese questionnaire.

### Security and Privacy Behaviors

#### Experience with Attacks or Events
1. **Have you ever experienced the following attacks or events while using a mobile device?**
   - (a) Virus infection
   - (b) Anti-virus alert
   - (c) Private information theft
   - (d) Compromised user ID, password, location, or picture
   - (e) Forced subscription to unwanted paid service
   - (f) Browser alert
   - (g) Other issues
   - Possible answers for each sub-question:
     - (a) No
     - (b) I don’t know
     - (c) Within the past 3 months
     - (d) Within the past year
     - (e) Over a year ago

#### Security Measures
2. **Have you installed an anti-virus on your smartphone?**
   - (a) Yes
   - (b) No
   - (c) I don’t know

3. **Which market are you using for app download?**
   - (a) Google Play, Apple Store
   - (b) au Market (KDDI’s affiliate)

#### Responses to Warning Pages
4. **How do you respond to a warning page in your browser?**
   - (a) I proceed to the next page without further thinking
   - (b) I proceed to the next page if the webpage is important to me
   - (c) I proceed to the next page if the webpage is popular/famous enough
   - (d) I do not proceed if the browser shows a warning
   - (e) Other
   - (f) I have never seen a warning page

#### Security Practices
The next group of questions (borrowed from RSeBIS, [73]) takes, as answers, a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “Completely disagree” to “Perfectly agree.”
1. **When someone sends me a link, I open it only after verifying where it goes.**
2. **I know what website I’m visiting by looking at the URL bar, rather than by the website’s look and feel.**
3. **I verify that information will be sent securely (e.g., SSL, "https://," a lock icon) before I submit it to websites.**
4. **When browsing websites, I mouse-over links to see where they go, before clicking them.**
5. **If I discover a security problem, I fix or report it rather than assuming somebody else will.**

#### Self-Confidence in Security
Finally, the last group of questions on self-confidence also takes, as answers, a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “Completely disagree” to “Perfectly agree.”
1. **I know about countermeasures for keeping the data on my device from being exploited.**
2. **I know about countermeasures to protect myself from monetary loss when using the Internet.**
3. **I know about countermeasures to prevent my IDs or passwords from being stolen.**
4. **I know about countermeasures to prevent my devices from being compromised.**
5. **I know about countermeasures to protect me from being deceived by fake websites.**
6. **I know about countermeasures to prevent my data from being stolen during web browsing.**
