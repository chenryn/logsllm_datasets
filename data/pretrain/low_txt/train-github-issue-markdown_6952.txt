### Issue Details
- **Node Version:** v12.16.1
- **Electron Version:** v11.0.0-beta.13
- **Electron-builder Version:** v22.9.1
- **Operating System:** macOS 10.15.2
- **Last Known Working Electron Version:** v10.1.4

Hello,

I am unsure if this is the appropriate place to post this issue or if it should be created in the electron-builder repository. However, since the behavior changed between Electron version 10.x and 11, I believe it might be relevant here. Please let me know if I should open this issue elsewhere.

We are experiencing an issue when building our application with Electron version 11-beta using electron-builder. Our application relies on static binaries (such as FFmpeg) to be included in the build. However, when starting the built application, we encounter a JavaScript error stating that the `package.json` file for the module is invalid (Unexpected end of JSON input).

### Expected Behavior
The production application should run similarly to the development environment.

### Actual Behavior
The production build crashes on startup.

Upon inspecting the contents of the generated `.app`, the (unpacked) `app.asar` file includes the dependencies correctly, and the `package.json` is valid.

### To Reproduce
The project runs fine in the development environment, but the finalized build has issues. I have created a repository with the base project and uploaded the built version in the 1.0.0 release of this repository.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lmancel/electron-tests.git
$ cd electron-tests
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

Built binary:
