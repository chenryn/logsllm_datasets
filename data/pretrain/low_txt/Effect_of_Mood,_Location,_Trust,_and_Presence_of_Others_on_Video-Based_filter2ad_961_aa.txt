**Abstract:**
Current fallback authentication mechanisms, such as security questions, are often unreliable and need improvement. Social authentication, particularly through video chat, shows promise as a novel form of fallback authentication. In this study, we conducted a four-week experiment to explore people’s perceived willingness to use video chat for social authentication. We examined how mood, location, trust, and the presence of others influenced participants' willingness to use video chat for authentication. Our findings indicate that participants who were alone, in a positive mood, and had higher levels of trust in others were more willing to use video chat for authentication. Additionally, participants were more willing to help others authenticate via video chat than to initiate a session themselves. These results provide initial insights into the human-computer interaction issues associated with using video chat as a fallback authentication method within a small, trusted social network.

**1. Introduction**
Web services and mobile applications primarily rely on user-provided passwords for authentication. However, passwords are frequently forgotten, with nearly three-quarters of users reporting that they often or sometimes forget a password [69]. A survey by SAP Inc. found that over 12 months, 84% of users forgot a password at least once [35]. Passwords are also susceptible to theft, often through phishing or reuse across multiple platforms [7]. When passwords are compromised, users must resort to secondary or fallback authentication methods to regain access to their accounts.

Common fallback authentication mechanisms include security questions and out-of-band communications, which are often unreliable or difficult to use. Research has shown that answers to security questions are easily guessable by acquaintances [73, 77, 94], and forgetting passwords, usernames, and security question answers are the most common reasons for authentication failures [61]. Fallback authentication via SMS or email is generally more secure and usable than security questions [13]. However, mobile phones are frequently lost or stolen [15, 21, 80], and when this occurs, the legitimate owner may not receive the SMS or email. Consequently, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends avoiding SMS or email as out-of-band authenticators [38].

To address the limitations of SMS and email, Libonati and colleagues [60] proposed a system where a phone remains usable only while in its owner's possession, confirmed by the owner's social network members. For example, video chatting with the owner could serve as a notarization that the owner still possesses the phone. If a sufficient time passes without successful notarization, the phone's functionality would be degraded, and critical capabilities, such as approving a fallback authentication push notification, would be unavailable until re-authentication.

Involving another person as a notary to confirm the owner's possession of their phone raises several feasibility and motivation questions. Libonati and colleagues [60] explored these questions in a lab study, finding that notarization by strangers can be effective. However, their study did not address the usability of video-based social authentication outside the lab and over a longer period. This study aims to explore the factors affecting people's willingness to use video-based social authentication.

**2.1 Fallback Authentication**
**2.1.1 Security Questions**
Security questions are widely used as a secondary or fallback authentication mechanism. While answers to security questions are easy to recall, about one-third of the answers can be guessed by close associates [94], and nearly forty percent can be guessed by parents, partners, or close friends [73]. Bank security questions have usability and security issues, including inapplicability, ambiguity, lack of memorability, and guessability [75]. A study by Google in 2015 found it nearly impossible to design security questions that are both secure and memorable [13].

**2.1.2 Out-of-Band Communications**
Out-of-band communication, such as SMS or email, is a popular alternative to security questions. Using SMS or email for fallback authentication is considered more secure and reliable by tech companies like Google [13]. However, SMS is also risky due to the security and privacy vulnerabilities of mobile phones and SMS [89]. NIST deprecated SMS as an out-of-band verification method, though recent guidance has softened this stance [38].

Mobile phones are frequently lost or stolen, with 31% of U.S. mobile phone owners having experienced loss or theft, and 12% reporting unauthorized access [15]. Current solutions like Google’s ‘Find your phone’ [37] and Apple’s ‘Find my iPhone’ [4] are reactive and can be disabled or hacked [62, 78, 90].

**2.2 Social Authentication**
Social authentication, defined as the use of social knowledge or trust relationships in authentication systems, has shown promise as a fallback mechanism. Schechter and colleagues designed a social authentication system for Windows Live ID, achieving a 90% success rate for those who called trustees [77]. Facebook’s Trusted Contacts system, launched in 2011 and redesigned in 2013, added a layer of security by asking users to verify information about their social contacts [50, 51]. Yardi and colleagues developed a photo-based web authentication framework, where users verify others with tagged photos [91].

Video-based authentication, such as device notarization (DNo), involves a notary confirming the supplicant's identity via a short video chat [60]. Shropshire and Menard proposed a similar approach using videos and trusted contacts [82]. Video-based authentication is being explored for high-value transactions, such as banking [12, 42]. While DNo and other social authentication systems have been tested in lab settings, external factors in the field, such as mood, location, trust, and the presence of others, may affect their efficiency and reliability. This study aims to explore these factors in research questions RQ1 and RQ2.

**3. Method**
Our study consisted of three main steps: a pre-survey, an experience sampling method (ESM) data collection over four weeks, and a post-survey. We organized our methods into five sub-sections: recruitment and participants, pre-survey, experience sampling, post-survey, and ethical considerations.

**3.1 Recruitment and Participants**
We advertised the study as “a study that uses video chat as an alternative form of authentication, instead of using passwords or security questions.” Participants were recruited in two phases: initially via social media, flyers, and word of mouth, and then through snowball sampling, where existing participants suggested potential participants from their social networks [36]. Thirty-six individuals expressed interest, and after addressing technical issues and dropouts, 30 participants completed the study. Each participant received a $40 gift card upon completion.

**3.2 Pre-Survey**
The pre-survey included demographic questions (gender, age, race, income, education), mobile app usage, and the perceived sensitivity of data captured by those apps. Participants listed their most frequently used mobile apps and rated their data sensitivity. They also provided information on PIN usage, prior video chat experience, and weekly video chat hours. Participants listed up to ten individuals from their social network who might be interested in participating, and each participant uploaded a photo and responded to trust questions about the listed individuals using an adapted interpersonal trust scale [53].

**3.3 Experience Sampling**
**3.3.1 The Experience Sampling Method (ESM)**
ESM prompts participants to provide systematic self-reports about events as they occur in daily life [24]. ESM minimizes reliance on memory and reconstruction, making it more reliable than other self-report methods [26]. It is well-suited for ubiquitous computing and mobile device studies [10, 24].

**3.3.2 Group Formation**
We used the social network information from the pre-survey to form groups. Six participants were placed in each group, resulting in five groups. Each group included some participants who knew each other and some who did not. We first paired known participants and then randomly assigned these pairs to ensure a mix of known and unknown individuals in each group. Two groups had three known participants and three strangers, while the other three groups had two known participants and four strangers. We used the same trust scale to measure the impact of trust on willingness to use video-based social authentication.
