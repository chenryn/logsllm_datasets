Subject: Performance Issue After Symfony Upgrade on CI Server

Hi Team,

Following our recent vendor upgrade, we have encountered a significant increase in execution time on our Continuous Integration (CI) server. Upon investigation, I found the following details:

**Environment:**
- **Operating System:** Windows 7 x64
- **Symfony Version:** 2.6.5 and 2.6.8
- **Mode:** Development (dev)

**Execution Time Comparison:**

- **Before Upgrade (Symfony 2.6.5):**
  - Total Execution Time: 755 ms
  - Initialization Time: 480 ms

- **After Upgrade (Symfony 2.6.8):**
  - Total Execution Time: 9622 ms
  - Initialization Time: 9405 ms

**Upgrade Details:**
- `composer update symfony/symfony`
  - Removed: `symfony/symfony v2.6.5`
  - Installed: `symfony/symfony v2.6.8`
- No other vendors were updated.

**Additional Observations:**
- The problem is also present on Linux.
- The PHP error log is empty.
- The development log appears normal.
- The production mode is unaffected by this issue.

We would greatly appreciate any assistance in resolving this performance issue.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
