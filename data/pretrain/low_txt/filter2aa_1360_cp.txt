### IntelTechniques IP Addresses Tool
The IntelTechniques IP Addresses Tool automates common IP address searches. The first box accepts any IP address. Clicking the "Populate All" button inserts this address into all search options, allowing for manual queries. The final option opens several tabs in your browser, presenting each query listed on the page. Figure 24.03 displays the current status of the service.

### GetNotify
GetNotify is a free service that tracks the opening of email messages and provides connection information about the recipient. To use it, create an account at getnotify.com. You are limited to five email messages per day. After registering, send emails from your account as usual, but add ".getnotify.com" after each recipient's email address. For example, instead of sending to `michael@inteltechniques.com`, send to `michael@inteltechniques.com.getnotify.com`. This routes the email through GetNotify's servers and to the valid address. When the recipient reads the email, GetNotify tracks their IP address, geographical location, and whether the message was viewed or deleted.

GetNotify works by adding a small, invisible tracking image to outgoing emails. When the recipient opens the message, this image is downloaded from a GetNotify server, notifying you that the message was read. You can view log files within your online account. Optionally, you can specify your own images as tracking images in the preferences section. The recipient will not see ".getnotify.com" at the end of their email address. If you want to send a single email to multiple recipients, add ".getnotify.com" to each email address.

### Example Scenario
If you click a link from a Mac computer using Firefox, I would know the following:
- **Device**: Mac
- **Browser**: Firefox
- **Hardware Details**: Specifics about your hardware
- **Fonts Installed**: All fonts on your operating system
- **Connection**: PIA VPN from a west coast server
- **System Time**: Set to Mountain Time
- **Login Status**: Logged in to a Google product

To see what details your computer would submit to this script, visit the test page at the following URL.

### Applications and Use Cases
These techniques can be beneficial in various scenarios. For example, law enforcement uses them to track stolen goods on Craigslist, private investigators use them on dating websites to catch cheating spouses, and singles use them to verify the location of potential mates. The possibilities are endless.

### Data Collection and Privacy
This page does not collect or store your details on the server; it simply generates queries through JavaScript in your browser. Any website could replicate these tactics to collect data about your visit. Therefore, investigators should always use caution and practice good operational security. For more on this topic, see the book "Extreme Privacy."
