### Figure 8. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of Time Intervals Between Identification of Suspicious Updates and the Arrival of Spam

The CDF of time intervals between the detection of suspicious hijacking attempts and the arrival of spam is illustrated in Figure 8. Although the exact percentages of hijacked prefixes used for spamming and the percentage of spam sources using hijacked prefixes are unknown, this result indicates a non-negligible correlation between highly likely hijacked prefixes and spam sources, suggesting a potential mode of exploiting routing infrastructures for spamming.

### 6.3. Validation Using Spam Source IPs

### 6.4. Reducing False Positives and Negatives

Hijacked IP prefixes are often used by spammers to send spam. Ramachandran et al. [40] recently found that a significant amount of spam was sent from short-lived, possibly hijacked IP prefixes by analyzing the network-level behavior of spammers using spam collected via a "spam sinkhole" or a honeypot-like spam domain. To validate our work, we correlate our identified suspicious hijacking attempts with the source IPs of the spam data in [40] for the same two-week period.

Table 4 summarizes the correlation results, where "matched prefixes" indicate prefixes appearing in both datasets within a three-day time window. This helps in understanding the time-related spam behavior. The number of matched prefixes is compared to previous work in detecting IP hijacking, which solely relies on the identification of MOAS conflicts as an indication. Our system successfully reduces both false positive and false negative rates. Due to the wide range of valid reasons for MOAS and sub-MOAS, alarming every MOAS or sub-MOAS conflict would cause excessive false notifications, overwhelming network administrators and hiding important alarms for real hijacking attacks.

In contrast, our scheme provides more definitive evidence for suspicious hijacking attacks by checking for fundamental differences, such as data plane inconsistencies, between valid and hijacking cases, thereby greatly reducing the likelihood of false positives. For example, during the experiment period, 3,685 MOAS conflicts occurred (more than one MOAS conflict per hour), which may be too frequent to handle. After the fingerprinting check, only 332 highly suspicious cases were left for further investigation, resulting in a significant reduction in false positives. On the other hand, MOAS-based detection schemes also suffer from significant false negatives because attackers can evade MOAS conflicts (and thus the detection) by choosing other attack schemes. Although our system cannot completely eliminate false positives and false negatives that may stem from changing fingerprints, server farms, and faking fingerprints, it minimizes such possibilities through various verification schemes, such as multiple fingerprinting techniques, edge popularity checks, and relationship checks, making our system more efficient and incrementally deployable on the current Internet.

### 7. Discussions and Conclusions

We discuss several limitations of our work and plans for future improvement. First, our system is triggered based on anomalous routing updates. However, hijacking may not be visible on the control plane, as the data plane is not guaranteed to be consistent with advertised routes. We plan to explore continuous monitoring and performance-triggered probing to augment the current approach. We also plan to analyze in more detail the accuracy of fingerprinting techniques. A second, more serious limitation is that probing will be limited by the availability of vantage points and the increasing deployment of firewalls. We plan to explore coverage based on probing locations and network-based fingerprints. Note that our system can be deployed either by individual networks or by a centralized system. In the latter case, we have demonstrated the scalability of the system, but we did not address the issue of reliably notifying victims, which is challenging due to the impact of IP hijacking. Work by Lad et al. [33] suggests the use of diverse paths, without providing absolute guarantees.

In summary, we present a framework for accurate, real-time IP address hijacking detection. Our work is based on the novel insight that a real hijacking attack will result in conflicting data-plane fingerprints describing the hijacked network. Using this key difference, we can significantly reduce both false positives and false negatives and more confidently identify IP hijacking without sacrificing efficiency. This is the first work exploiting the consistency between data-plane and control-plane information to identify IP hijacking attacks. Our system can be incrementally deployed without modifying any infrastructure or requiring support from networks. We have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of a prototype system using real data.
