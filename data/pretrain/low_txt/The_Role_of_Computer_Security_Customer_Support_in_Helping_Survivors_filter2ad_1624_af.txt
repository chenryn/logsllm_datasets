### Considerations for Notification and Language Use
It is crucial to consider that the notification may escalate violence if read by the abuser. Additionally, inappropriate language in the notification can re-traumatize the survivor. 

### Coordinated Approaches for Support
We envision a coordinated approach to support survivors through this partnership. Rather than sporadic referrals to domestic violence hotlines, computer security companies and IPV (Intimate Partner Violence) professionals could collaborate to deploy remote security clinics [80] with tailored digital safety planning for individual survivors. An established partnership would increase the confidence of IPV professionals in referring their clients to computer security companies that are committed to providing knowledgeable and compassionate assistance.

Notably, support agents and IPV professionals should reach a consensus on their respective responsibilities in such a collaboration. Support agents should handle technical issues and provide basic tech safety tips, while IPV professionals should focus on comprehensive safety planning and non-technical assistance. This ensures that survivors do not end up being referred back and forth between these parties without receiving the help they need.

### Conclusion
IPV is a pervasive problem that increasingly manifests in the digital realm. Supporting IPV survivors who are experiencing tech-enabled abuse requires the expertise of multiple stakeholders. We analyzed real-world support cases involving IPV at a large computer security company, gathered opinions from IPV professionals on how customer support could assist survivors, and explored the feasibility of implementing their proposed suggestions with support practitioners. We identified opportunities for customer support to help survivors with care and precaution, such as by sharing tech safety resources and making external referrals.

We provide recommendations for computer security companies to address tech-enabled IPV through customer support, including training frontline agents and building partnerships with IPV advocates. Based on this research, we have started providing respective training to partner companies. These early efforts highlight the potential of computer security customer support as a feasible and necessary channel to help IPV survivors and potentially a broader range of tech abuse victims.
