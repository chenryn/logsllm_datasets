### A Framework for the Application of Association Rule Mining

#### 1. Introduction
In a set of rules where actual attacks span a wide range of signatures and are associated with reconnaissance events, such as TCP port scans, the attacker's goal is to discover open vulnerabilities on a system to exploit in future attacks. A special case that must be considered when searching for these types of attacks is whether the scanning activity is legitimate traffic generated as part of a policy verification procedure. This is most commonly caused by the use of an automated scanning appliance under the control of the network security staff to ensure that hosts have been updated with the most recent security patches.

#### 2. Scanning Activity Rules
- **[RPC Race Condition Exploitation] ⇒ [TCP SYN Port Sweep]**
  - Confidence: 51%
  - Support: 1.8%

- **[SQL Query in HTTP Request] ⇒ [TCP SYN Port Sweep]**
  - Confidence: 43%
  - Support: 1.7%

- **[FTP RealPath Buffer Overflow] ⇒ [TCP SYN Port Sweep]**
  - Confidence: 100%
  - Support: 0.2%

#### 3. Worm-Related Rules
Worms propagate by exploiting vulnerabilities to gain control of a victim server, subsequently scanning the network for other vulnerable machines to ensure rapid and widespread infection before a patch can be implemented. The following example rules define a multi-stage worm attack that took advantage of file-sharing vulnerabilities in a widely deployed operating system.

- **[NETBIOS SMB–DS IPC Unicode Share Access][ICMP L3 Retriever Ping] ⇒ [NETBIOS SMB–DS Session Setup and Request Unicode Username Overflow Attempt]**
  - Confidence: 100%
  - Support: 41%

Another example of worm-related patterns detected describes correlations relevant to the SQL Slammer worm, which ravaged the Internet in 2002 and is still frequently detected. This worm exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability to execute malicious code and install itself on the victim machine, after which it scanned for other hosts to propagate. Two mature signatures exist for this worm in our monitoring environment. The first signature describes the initial overflow attempt, followed by a propagation attempt. Our framework determined a strong correlation between these two signatures, allowing us to code a new rule into the ESM (Event Security Manager) to watch for this pattern and raise a meta-alarm when detected.

- **[MS-SQL Version Overflow Attempt] ⇒ [MS-SQL Worm Propagation Attempt]**
  - Confidence: 100%
  - Support: 35%

Our method consistently detects patterns generated in the alarm stream by worm propagation, suggesting that the techniques presented here can be applied to detect future instances of emerging worm traffic, regardless of whether the intrusion detection sensors supply worm-specific signatures or if the new worm manifests as a combination of existing signatures.

#### 4. Identification of High-Risk Networks
On average, 87% of our experiments generated no rules for a given network over a 24-hour period. This translates to only 17 out of 135 networks producing rules in a single 24-hour period. Figure 4 shows a typical count of rules generated per monitored network on a logarithmic scale. In this case, 19 out of the 135 monitored networks produced rules. Of these 19 networks, 12 produced 10 or fewer rules for that particular day, while one network produced 117 and another produced 2295. Graphing these counts highlights anomalous networks, providing a useful tool for operational personnel to identify which networks require immediate attention.

**Figure 4: Anomalous Network Activity as Shown by a Count of Rules Produced Per Network for a Selected Day**

#### 5. Facilitation of Sensor Tuning and Root Cause Analysis
Similar to Julisch's use of cluster analysis for identifying the root cause of false positive alarms, we found that our data mining framework can facilitate the determination of root causes of certain alarms. Figure 5 shows a 30-day trend of rule volumes broken out by day for a selected network. The spikes represent the generation of 4854 and 7926 rules on two separate days, respectively. Upon inspection, these rules described a denial-of-service attack on an electronic commerce site, covering 47% of the alarms generated on those days. The rules were comprised of a flood of Half Open SYN signatures, coupled with various other attack signatures. Further investigation revealed that the actual cause was a misconfigured IP route between a web application server and an LDAP server. Fixing this IP routing problem reduced the corresponding alarms, increasing the fidelity of the alarm stream and reducing the risk of overlooking legitimate attack traffic.

#### 6. Conclusion
We have outlined a novel framework for applying association rule mining techniques to the millions of alarms received daily at large Managed Security Service Providers. As new attack strategies emerge, our framework successfully discovers the associated patterns of alarms resulting from the attacker's actions in the victim network. By highlighting these patterns, we reduce the time required for SOC personnel to implement meta-rules ensuring the detection of future instances of emerging attacks.

Our framework provides a reliable means of closing the time gap between the appearance of new attack profiles in the alarm logs and the configuration of rules in the ESM. We accomplished this while reducing human error and the costs associated with manually inspecting large alarm logs. Additionally, our framework can flag suspicious network activity for in-depth analysis by operations staff in an offline environment, detecting a variety of attack classes that may be lost in large data volumes due to processing time constraints in the online monitoring system.
