Application performance monitoring (APM) and observability tools provide visibility into the digital experience, optimizing user engagement. These tools now include security features, and the OpenTelemetry standard is poised to bring a new level of standardization. With a wide array of tools available, I&O leaders must identify their critical capabilities.

#### Overview
- **Key Findings:**
  - The demand for online channels and delivery continues to grow, even as the pandemic slows.
  - Increased security breaches have led some APM and observability vendors to add security capabilities, such as runtime application self-protection.
  - The CNCF-curated OpenTelemetry distributed tracing standard is nearing completion and gaining widespread support. The first version, including logs, is expected by the end of 2022. Many vendors in this research already support OpenTelemetry.

- **Recommendations:**
  - I&O leaders responsible for infrastructure, operations, and cloud management should:
    - Choose APM and observability solutions that cater to use cases and personas outside IT operations, such as DevOps, site reliability engineering (SRE), and security operations. This fosters collaboration, maximizes tool value, and broadens the target audience.
    - Prioritize support for OpenTelemetry and other standards in the APM and observability product selection process to ensure future flexibility.
    - Align requirements, use cases, and relevance to appropriate personas and best-fit tool options using this research and Gartner’s Cool Vendors research to navigate the rapidly evolving APM market.

#### What You Need to Know
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM) and Observability Software:**
  - These tools enable the observation and analysis of application health, performance, and user experience (UX). They are widely used by IT operations, SREs, cloud and platform operations, application developers, and product owners.
  - Key functional requirements include:
    - Observation of an application’s complete transactional behavior.
    - Automated discovery and mapping of application and infrastructure dependencies, including cloud services.
    - Monitoring of applications on mobile devices and desktop browsers.
    - Identification and analysis of application performance problems and their impact on business outcomes.
    - Native integration with automation and service management tools, and public cloud providers like AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Google Cloud Operations.
    - Analysis of business key performance indicators (KPIs) and user journeys.
    - Interactive interrogation of multiple telemetry types (traces, metrics, and logs) to detect "unknown unknowns."
    - Application security functionality, often delivered via a common agent or framework.

- **Critical Capabilities and Use Cases:**
  - Gartner has identified six critical capabilities in the context of six use cases that differentiate the most popular tools in the market:
    - **Critical Capabilities:**
      - Application debugging and distributed profiling (ADDP)
      - Behavior analysis
      - Business analysis
      - IT service and infrastructure monitoring
      - Root cause analysis (RCA)
      - Runtime application self-protection (RASP)
    - **Use Cases:**
      - Application owner/line of business (LOB)
      - DevOps/AppDev
      - Digital experience monitoring (DEM)
      - IT operations
      - Security operations
      - Site reliability engineering (SRE)/platform operations

- **Research Focus:**
  - This research focuses on the competitiveness of APM software products in key functional dimensions rather than the overall strengths and weaknesses of the vendors. It complements the Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring, which defines the market and highlights factors such as corporate viability, vision, marketing, and geographic focus. Organizations should use this research in conjunction with the Magic Quadrant, inquiries with Gartner analysts, and other Gartner research to define their requirements and select the best-matching solutions.

#### Analysis
- **Critical Capabilities Use-Case Graphics:**

  - Best suited for IT operations and security operations use cases.

- **Broadcom:**
  - Broadcom’s DX APM SaaS is available on-premises or as SaaS, providing functionality and code parity. It integrates with Broadcom’s AIOps products and offers a wide range of enterprise software.
  - Broadcom scored above the mean in RCA, IT service monitoring, and application debugging and profiling. Its security offerings, largely from Symantec, are standalone.
  - Best suited for IT operations and SRE/platform operations use cases.

- **Cisco (AppDynamics):**
  - Cisco’s APM and observability suite includes AppDynamics, ThousandEyes, Intersight Workload Optimizer, and Cisco Secure Application. It provides full-stack observability, including infrastructure, application, UX, business context, and security.

  - Best suited for application owners/line of business and RASP use cases.

- **Datadog:**
  - Datadog’s platform offers a unified interface with integrated components for APM, Continuous Profiler, Serverless Monitoring, Log Management, Database Monitoring, and Real-User and Synthetic Monitoring.
  - Datadog scored above average in all critical capabilities, excelling in application debugging, distributed tracing, and continuous profiling but lagging in RASP.
  - Best suited for midsize to large enterprises, particularly those with applications in cloud or hybrid environments. Well-aligned with the behavior analysis use case.
