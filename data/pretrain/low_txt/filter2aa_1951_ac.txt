### Sound Effects: Exploring Acoustic Cyber-Weapons
**August 2019**
**PwC**

#### Implications – Bluetooth and Smart Speakers

- **Risk of Permanent Damage**: Smart speakers can be permanently damaged by acoustic attacks.
- **Fire Hazard**: Component "burn-out" due to prolonged exposure to high-frequency noise (HFN) or low-frequency noise (LFN) can pose a fire hazard.
- **Vulnerability of Other Models**: Similar vulnerabilities may exist in other models, extending the risk.

#### Feasibility of Attacks

- **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Any attack capable of executing arbitrary code could deploy these acoustic weapons.
- **Factors Influencing Vulnerability**:
  - **Imperceptibility**: The noise must be inaudible to humans.
  - **Susceptibility**: The device's sensitivity to specific frequencies.
  - **Exposure Duration**: The length of time the device is exposed to the noise.
  - **Audible Components**: Subharmonics, distortion, and other audible artifacts can be mitigated with multiple fade-ins and fade-outs.

- **Physical Access and Other Avenues**: Some attacks require physical or local access, such as Bluetooth. Attackers might also explore other avenues like espionage, sabotage, or financial gain.

#### Countermeasures

- **Device-Level**:
  - **Frequency Range Limitation**: Restrict the frequency range of speakers.
  - **User Alerts**: Visibly alert users when speakers are in use.
  - **File Filtering**: Remove high/low frequency noise during file processing.
  - **Permission Restrictions**: Implement permission restrictions on the use of speakers by apps.
  - **Heuristic Detection**: Monitor for unusual volume level requests and mute suspicious apps.
  - **Legitimate Uses**: Recognize legitimate uses for ultrasound, such as Google Nearby Messages.

- **Environment-Level**:
  - **Monitoring HFN/LFN**: Use sound level meters (SLMs) and specialist equipment to monitor the environment.
  - **Smartphone Apps**: Utilize apps like Ultrasound Detector and Infrasound Detector on Android devices.
  - **Pilot Study**: Our pilot study used both SLMs and smartphone apps (Kardous & Shaw, 2014).
  - **Occupational Noise Measurement**: Modern smartphones can be suitable for occupational noise measurement within their limitations.
  - **Accuracy Considerations**: Accept a certain loss of accuracy based on the device's capabilities.

- **SoundAlert for HFN Detection**:
  - **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: A modified open-source application that provides simple alerts when noise exceeds a threshold.
  - **Usage Disclaimer**: Do not use this tool for evaluating the risk of damage, adverse effects, or for safety/compliance assessments. Employ a trained professional with appropriate equipment.

- **Policy-Level**:
  - **Review Guidelines**: Current guidelines often lack clarity and underestimate the effects of HFN/LFN outside occupational contexts.
  - **Compliance and Checks**: Employers must comply with applicable legislation and conduct regular checks.

#### Conclusion

- **Limitations**:
  - **Small Scale**: Limited number of devices and short exposure times.
  - **Constant Emission**: Continuous emission of HFN/LFN may degrade audio equipment.
  - **No Human Experimentation**: Ethical and safety concerns preclude human experimentation on perceptibility and susceptibility.

- **Future Work**:
  - **Further Research**: More research is needed on the risks of HFN and LFN, including a wider range of equipment, larger-scale studies, and longer durations.
  - **Overheating Effects**: Investigate overheating effects on other devices, taking appropriate safety precautions.
  - **Countermeasures**: Develop more effective detection methods.
  - **Ethical Challenges**: Address the ethical restrictions that make extrapolation challenging.

- **Summary**:
  - **Growing Attack Surface**: As digital and physical worlds become more integrated, attackers may increasingly target vulnerabilities in acoustic systems.
  - **Current Triviality**: Current attacks are often trivial but may become more effective at scale.
  - **Lack of Consensus**: There is a lack of consensus on adequate safety guidelines.
  - **Available Countermeasures**: Despite challenges, countermeasures are available, and real-world consequences are difficult to assess.
