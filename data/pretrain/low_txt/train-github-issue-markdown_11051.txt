I am experiencing issues with `.AppleDouble` directories, which are being included when I execute commands from the command line. Symfony is incorrectly trying to load classes from the files "inside" these `.AppleDouble` directories, even though they only contain metadata and should be ignored.

This issue was previously addressed in issue #994 and supposedly fixed in commit `7ab3fde`. However, this fix does not work for me. The problem appears to stem from the fact that `.AppleDouble` is a directory, not a file. If I add `.AppleDouble` to the VCS patterns, the issue is resolved, and no files within the `.AppleDouble` directory are processed.

While adding `.AppleDouble` to the VCS patterns works, it does not seem like the most appropriate solution. A more suitable approach might be to rename `$vcsPatterns` to `$directoryPatterns`, which would better reflect its purpose. If this suggestion sounds reasonable, I am willing to submit a pull request to implement this change.
