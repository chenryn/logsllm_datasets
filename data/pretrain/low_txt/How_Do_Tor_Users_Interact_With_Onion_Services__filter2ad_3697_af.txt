### Clarity and Protection in Tor and Onion Services

Many users have a vague understanding of what Tor and onion services actually protect. Statements like "doing X is safer" are not helpful. Tor needs to be more transparent in explaining its capabilities and limitations, and it should avoid promoting itself to those who do not fully understand its functions. Specifically, 11 out of 517 respondents expressed concerns about the lack of anonymity protection from government agencies, large corporations, or even the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Additionally, 8 out of 517 wanted to verify the legitimacy and status of onion services, while only 2 out of 517 mentioned their desire for the dark web to be free of criminal content.

### Education and Resources

Twenty-four survey respondents highlighted a "knowledge" issue, noting that there are insufficient resources and documentation for newcomers to Tor and onion services. This sentiment was echoed by 7 out of 17 interviewees. For example, P8 expressed a need for clear user education during the installation process: "Really clear user education in the installation process would be great for people like me... who are like ‘Okay, this is a thing I can use, why am I using it again? What am I using it for? What does it do?’" Three interviewees referred to the lack of proper education as "cultural mysticism." As P10 explained, the perception that these are advanced security tools often deters ordinary users, who may think they are difficult or poorly designed. Even if knowledge were not an issue, the fear of consequences can still deter users, as P8 noted: "Because it’s also super scary. You think you’re playing with this spy thing... Sometimes it’s actually a really simple technical thing that’s not terrifying. And to demystify those things would be really nice."

### Improved Search

Fifteen out of 517 survey respondents called for better accessibility to onion services, such as through a robust search engine or organized database. At least four interviewees shared this desire. S116, for instance, suggested: "Ask someone to develop a really good search engine so that sites may be found. I am sure that the dark net has to be more than a few illicit sites that are selling stolen credit cards and running Bitcoin scams. I feel like when I browse the dark net, I am floating in space waiting for another planet to suddenly appear. Whatever content is out there needs to be discovered, lest people will make misinformed judgments about the dark net. The dark net should be understood to be preeminently about privacy, not criminality." Many respondents also expressed frustration at the difficulty of finding out if a particular public website has a corresponding onion service. A common request was for websites to list their onion service prominently in a footer or on their main site (3 out of 517). Interestingly, some respondents were surprised to learn that torproject.org has a corresponding onion site, as it was not clearly indicated on the website.

### Future Directions

Our research highlights several opportunities for improving current onion services:

#### Security Indicators for Onion Services
Many participants had an incomplete understanding of how onion services work and trusted them less than other Tor services. This suggests the need for a better indicator of the protections offered by onion services. The Tor Project is currently working on a security indicator for onion services [1]. Figure 2b shows that the Tor Browser, in version 7.0.10, displays an onion service connection as an insecure HTTP connection, which underestimates the security and privacy provided. The design process for such indicators should ensure that users understand their meaning and how they differ from HTTPS indicators.

#### Privacy-Preserving Bookmarking
Some users resorted to memorizing links to avoid security issues with storing onion links. This problem indicates the need for a privacy-preserving bookmarking tool that allows users to save sites without leaving a trail in their browser storage or elsewhere on their system.

### Conclusion

Onion services resemble the 1990s web, with slow page loads, clumsy user interfaces, and inadequate search engines. Users appreciate the extra security, privacy, and NAT punching properties of onion services, leading to a variety of use cases. However, users face numerous privacy, security, and usability concerns that need to be addressed in future generations of onion services. For example, users are concerned about the susceptibility of onion domains to phishing attacks, and the leakage of onion domains to the public internet demonstrates that this threat is real and unaddressed. Users also have limited ways of discovering and navigating to onion services.

A range of design improvements, from better discovery mechanisms to automatic "upgrading" to a corresponding onion service when available, are initial steps to improve usability. Some of these desired features have clear analogs in the public internet, such as the padlock icon as a security indicator for HTTPS and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to automatically upgrade an HTTP connection to HTTPS. We expect that many of the usability design lessons from the public internet may also apply to onion services.
