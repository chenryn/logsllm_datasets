## Abstract
Social live video streaming (SLVS) applications, such as Facebook Live, YouTube Live, Twitch, and Periscope, have gained significant popularity. A key characteristic of these platforms is the ability to view live streams in real-time or at various time-shifted delays. In mobile environments, where upload bandwidth can be highly variable, existing solutions often prioritize either low-latency viewing with lower quality or higher quality with significant delay, without considering the diverse needs of time-shifted viewers.

In this paper, we introduce Vantage, a live-streaming upload solution that enhances the overall quality of experience for diverse time-shifted viewers. Vantage uses selective quality-enhancing retransmissions in addition to real-time frames, optimizing encoding schedules to balance the allocation of available bandwidth. Our evaluation using real-world mobile network traces shows that Vance can provide high quality simultaneously for both low-latency and delayed viewing. For delayed viewing, Vantage achieves an average improvement of 19.9% over real-time optimized video streaming techniques, with observed gains of up to 42.9%. These benefits come at the cost of an average drop in real-time quality of 3.3%, with a maximum drop of 7.1%.

## 1 Introduction
Mobile live video traffic has grown significantly over the last decade, driven by advancements in mobile camera technology, computing power, and wireless technology. This growth has enabled high-quality video capture, encoding, and transmission in real-time from mobile devices. Applications like video-conferencing and live broadcasting are now ubiquitous on mobile devices. Social live video streaming (SLVS) applications, such as Facebook Live, YouTube Live, and Periscope, have become increasingly popular, bringing the power of live streaming to individuals.

A unique feature of SLVS platforms is the ability to view real-time, time-shifted, and archival versions of a single stream. SLVS applications enable viewers to interact with broadcasters via comments and reactions in real-time and also archive the video for later viewing. Platforms like Hangouts-on-air and Facebook Live allow multiple users to broadcast simultaneously on a single live stream. For interactive features, low-latency delivery is critical, while higher latency is acceptable for other viewers.

Traditional live video streaming applications target a single viewing delay. In video conferencing, low-latency is essential for interactivity, while broadcast events can tolerate tens of seconds of delay. Existing approaches for handling network bandwidth variations are tailored for one particular viewing delay. In low-latency applications, the video bitrate closely follows the available bandwidth, ensuring frames are received before their playback deadline but at the expense of lower quality during periods of low bandwidth. Conversely, when higher delays are acceptable, applications use buffers to absorb network variations, resulting in higher video quality and smoother playback but with higher latency.

Current SLVS platforms make similar trade-offs between latency and quality, despite the diversity of viewing delays. Operating at a single point on the latency-quality trade-off spectrum is inadequate for providing high quality-of-experience (QoE) for all viewers. The problem is exacerbated by the unpredictable network behavior of mobile devices.

In this paper, we present Vantage, a live video upload solution designed to address the time-shifted viewing characteristic of SLVS in the face of bandwidth variations. Vantage exploits the variability of the upload path to its advantage, using quality-enhancing retransmissions in conjunction with a low-latency video stream. Vantage formulates bitrate selection and transport scheduling as a joint optimization problem to maximize video quality across diverse viewing delays.

Several challenges need to be addressed to make the use of quality-enhancing retransmissions practical and effective:
1. Allocating bandwidth and scheduling transmissions for real-time and retransmitted frames to optimize QoE for all users.
2. Handling the computational overheads and latencies associated with complex optimization decisions and video compression.
3. Dealing with network unpredictability and its impact on scheduling decisions.

Vantage incorporates system design choices like approximations, pipelining, and fallback mechanisms to handle these challenges. We have implemented Vantage and evaluated it on a wide variety of mobile network traces and videos. Our evaluation shows that Vantage achieves high quality for both low-latency and time-shifted viewing. Specifically, for delayed viewing, Vantage achieves an average improvement of 19.9% over real-time optimized streaming techniques, with observed gains of up to 42.9%. The quality achieved by Vantage for delayed viewing is within 7.7% on average of the maximum quality achievable by delay-tolerant techniques. These benefits come at the cost of an average drop of 3.3% in real-time quality, with a maximum drop of 7.1%. These results demonstrate the significant performance benefits of using Vantage over current techniques used for SLVS applications, which primarily optimize the video upload for real-time viewing.

## 2 Background and Opportunity
### 2.1 SLVS Architectures
We describe common designs and practices employed by widely used SLVS platforms: Facebook Live, YouTube Live, Twitch, and Periscope. Live video is captured and encoded by a broadcaster's device (e.g., a mobile phone) and uploaded via RTMP or WebRTC to an ingestion point, where the upload path connection is terminated. The video is then re-encoded at various bitrates and handed off to a content delivery network, which delivers the video to viewers. This paper focuses on improvements for the upload path of SLVS applications.

### 2.2 Time-Shifted Viewing in SLVS
SLVS differs from traditional live streaming in that it enables viewing of the same video stream at different delays. Traditional live streaming applications are tailored either for interactive, low-latency streaming or for high-quality viewing at larger delays. SLVS platforms enable both real-time and delayed viewing of the same stream, a characteristic we term "time-shifted viewing." Some viewers require real-time latencies for interaction, while others can tolerate higher delays. SLVS platforms also archive video streams for later viewing and allow viewers to seek back to older segments during the live stream. Collaborative broadcasting platforms have stronger low-latency requirements for co-broadcasters compared to viewers. Thus, SLVS streams have audiences with varying degrees of latency tolerance, presenting a new dimension for improving the quality of experience.

### 2.3 Variability in the Upload Path
Many SLVS broadcasts are initiated from mobile devices over cellular networks, which experience frequent bandwidth fluctuations. This forces the broadcaster's device to adapt the bitrate of encoded video or use large sender-side buffers. To illustrate the variability of bandwidth in mobile uplinks, we analyzed network traces from the Mahimahi project. Across eight upload traces, we observed:
1. Periods of low/high bandwidth are common: 17.1% and 17.4% of the time, upload bandwidth is 50% or less and 150% or more than the average, respectively.
2. Periods of low/high bandwidth are short-lived: Periods with less than 50% and more than 150% of the average bandwidth last, on average, 789 ms and 809 ms, respectively.
3. More bandwidth is gained during high periods than is lost during low periods: In five out of the eight traces, there is at least 1.25× additional bandwidth when the bandwidth is above 150% of the average than the amount lost when bandwidth drops below 50% of the average.

These observations suggest that periods of high bandwidth can be exploited to improve the quality of frames affected by periods of low bandwidth. In the next section, we show how an SLVS upload solution can use these properties to improve the QoE for all time-shifted viewers.

## 3 Design of Vantage
In this section, we describe the design of Vantage and how it overcomes the challenges outlined in Section 3.2.3 to deliver high QoE to diverse time-shifted viewers.
