### Spatial Properties of Disruptions

Abrupt events affecting large prefixes exhibit distinct spatial properties, as seen in the red spikes in April and May in Figure 5. These properties differ from those observed during events like Hurricane Irma, which is represented by a blue spike and a recovery period in September in the same figure.

We acknowledge that this is only an initial step in studying the spatial properties of disruptions. Alternative methods for grouping /24 prefixes might involve more advanced clustering algorithms based on event timings [29] or other topological aspects, such as the last visible router on traceroutes to /24s.

### Temporal Patterns of Disruptions

Figure 5 reveals an intriguing pattern: over the course of the year, we observe a recurring day-of-the-week pattern, which is less pronounced during the Christmas/New Year's week. To better understand this pattern, we next examine when disruption events typically occur. To determine the local time of these events, we geolocate all disruption events using the CDN’s geolocation database. By leveraging geolocation with timezone information, we can estimate the local time of disruption events accurately.

Figure 7a breaks down the weekdays on which disruption events start, where "entire /24" indicates that all addresses in the prefix showed no activity, and "all" includes prefixes where some addresses still had activity. Complementing Figure 7a, Figure 7b shows the distribution of disruption start times across hours of the day.

#### Scheduled Maintenance

Surprisingly, we observe that disruptions are much more frequent on weekdays, particularly on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, which are typical maintenance windows. Similar findings have been reported by Comarela et al. in BGP [21] and Beverly et al. in their study of ISP router reboots [14]. The pattern becomes even clearer when examining the hour of the day of these events, as shown in Figure 7b. Most disruptions start after midnight local time, typically between 1 AM and 3 AM. These start times align with the maintenance windows of major ISPs (e.g., [19, 24]). In fact, disruptions during these maintenance windows dominate for many ISPs. We will revisit this observation in Section 8, where we discuss the properties of residential US ISPs.

### Device-Centric Analysis of Disruptions

Having studied the macroscopic properties of disruption events, we now shift our perspective to a device-centric view, using an orthogonal dataset that allows us to track the activity of individual devices before, during, and after disruption events. This approach enables us to study user mobility and identify instances where disruptions do not indicate service outages.

#### Device Activity Across Address Blocks

To study the activity of individual devices, we use logs from a service offered by the CDN. End users can install software that improves the performance of content accessed through the CDN. The software runs on Windows and Mac OS X and is installed on desktops and laptops but not on smartphones. Devices with the software installed periodically contact the CDN, identifying themselves with a unique software ID. The relevant log fields include the timestamp, the public IP address, and the software ID.

These logs are distinct from those used for the time-series-of-hits dataset in Section 3.1 and are generated only for clients with the software installed. Thus, while a log line indicates that a device was active at a given timestamp with a given IP address, the absence of a log line does not imply a lack of Internet connectivity. We use this dataset to further analyze identified disruptions.

#### Pairing Devices and Disruptions

We focus on disruption events that affected entire /24 address blocks, where no IP address showed any activity during the disruption. We identify all IDs that were active in the disrupted /24 address block within the last hour before the disruption, as illustrated in Figure 8. Out of 883K such disruption events, we found an ID active up to an hour before the disruption in 52K (5.9%) instances. We note the last IP address with which the device was active as IPbefore. If the ID is seen during the disruption from another address block, we call the first address associated with the ID during the disruption IPduring. Lastly, we note the first IP address after the disruption as IPafter. We then study the interplay of IDs and IP addresses during detected disruption events, as shown in Figure 9.

#### Cross-Validation of Disruption Events

We found only 6 instances (< 0.01%) where an ID was seen during a disruption with IPduring within the disrupted address block. This confirms the effectiveness of our disruption detection mechanism (§ 3) in detecting loss of Internet connectivity without falsely identifying disruptions in address blocks that still have connectivity. We exclude these 6 instances from our dataset.

#### No Device Activity During Disruptions

We first focus on disruptions where no intermediate activity was recorded, i.e., IPduring does not exist. This is the expected case, as devices in disrupted address blocks are presumed to have lost Internet connectivity. Indeed, the majority (about 86% of our disruptions) show this behavior. For these disruptions, we do not have any indications suggesting anything other than a service outage. We further group these instances into whether the IP address corresponding to the software ID changed (IPbefore ≠ IPafter) or remained the same (IPbefore = IPafter), as shown in Figure 9. This distinction is important because it gives us a different level of confidence in interpreting disruptions. If the IP address of an ID remained the same before and after the disruption, it is unlikely that the device was temporarily assigned a different address from the ISP and switched back to its original one [42]. We are thus more certain that such disruptions are service outages, as opposed to prefix migration events (discussed in the next section). If the address changed, we have lower confidence in distinguishing between device movement, address re-assignment, and service outages.

#### Device Activity During Disruptions

Next, we consider the more unexpected yet prevalent (about 14%) case: instances of disruptions where activity was recorded during the disruption period. Our records reflect a lower bound of activity during disruptions, as the software may not contact the CDN even if the end-host has Internet connectivity. This activity can result from several scenarios:

- **Mobility and Tethering**: Users can physically move to a different location and connect their device to a different network, or the device may be multi-homed, perhaps tethered through a cellular network. We refer to these instances as mobility, highlighted in orange in Figure 9. To identify such cases, we study if the switch from IPbefore to IPduring involved a switch from or to a cellular address block [51] or a different AS number. We note that in about 20% of the cases, users switched to a cellular network, and in another 13%, to a different ASN. While these cases do not reveal whether the detected disruption in the original address block resulted in a loss of service connectivity, they highlight that a significant fraction of end users are multi-homed, with the ability to switch between different access networks in the event of a potential network service outage.
  
- **Address Reassignment**: The user continues to use the same Internet service provider, but the public IP address through which the user’s device connects to the Internet has changed. Thus, we detect a sudden absence of all activity within the original address block and see activity from the same hosts from different address blocks in the same AS during the disruption. This is the most common case for during-disruption activity, accounting for about 67% of during-disruption activity instances and almost 10% of all detected disruption events for which we have device-specific information. While in the case of disruptions without activity (§ 5.2) and in cases of mobility and tethering, we do not gain hard evidence on whether a disruption really resulted in a service outage, we can infer that these 9.5% of disruptions are likely not the result of a service outage. We corroborate our findings that some disruptions are not service outages in Section 6, where we identify that instances of during-disruption activity often go along with an upsurge in overall address activity in the prefix a device moves to.

### Disruptions and Anti-Disruptions

Our device-centric analysis revealed that in about 10% of disruptions, devices do not lose access to service. We are interested in the interplay between such disrupted address blocks and the alternate /24 address blocks into which devices move.

#### Microscopic Anti-Disruptions

We return to our activity-per-/24 timeseries and inspect both the disrupted /24 and the alternate /24, identified using our software ID dataset (§ 5.3). Figure 10 shows an example where we plot the activity of the disrupted /24 in blue and the address activity of the alternate /24 in red in the negative y-direction. We can clearly observe patterns of alternating activity between the concerned address blocks, which we refer to as anti-disruption—temporary spikes in address activity in address blocks. While Figure 10 shows a clear anti-disruption signature, the shift on an individual /24 basis is not always so clear but may become apparent when viewed network-wide.

#### Network-Wide Anti-Disruptions

We seek to generalize our approach for detecting anti-disruptions without tracking individual devices. To do so, we invert our disruption detection mechanism (recall § 3.3) to detect anti-disruptions. Instead of calculating the minimum number of active addresses over the prior week window, we now calculate the maximum number of active addresses. We set our α value to 1.3 and β to 1.1. This allows us to detect address blocks that show irregularly high activity over short periods of time. We apply our mechanisms to the entire dataset and study disruptions and anti-disruptions on a per-AS level.

To visualize and correlate the magnitude of disruptions and anti-disruptions, for each disruption, we calculate the number of disrupted addresses in the /24 prefix as the difference between the median number of active addresses in the week prior to the disruption and the median number of addresses active during the disruption. We assign this number to each hour that the disruption existed. For each hour in the observation period, we sum the number of disrupted addresses, if any, for all disruptions observed in a given AS. We perform the analogous computation for anti-disruptions. Figure 11 shows three example ASes with different levels of correlation for disruptions and anti-disruptions. While the US ISP in Figure 11a shows virtually zero correlation between disruptions, the Spanish ISP in Figure 11b shows moderate correlation, and the Uruguayan ISP (bottom) shows that most disruptions and anti-disruptions in this AS align very clearly. We calculate the Pearson correlation across disruptions and anti-disruptions to express the degree of correlation for individual ASes.

#### ISP Feedback

We were surprised to see the anti-disruption pattern very strongly for some ISPs, which could heavily skew AS-based analysis of Internet reliability. Contacts from two ISPs, one cable and one DSL, confirmed that reassigning prefixes is a common practice, for example, to manage capacity.
