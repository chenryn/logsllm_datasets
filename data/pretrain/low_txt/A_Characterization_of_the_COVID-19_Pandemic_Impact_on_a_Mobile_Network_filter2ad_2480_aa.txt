## Abstract
In early 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus rapidly spread worldwide, prompting many governments to implement strict lockdown measures. These measures significantly altered people's mobility and habits, impacting the use of telecommunication networks. This paper investigates the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on a UK Mobile Network Operator (MNO). We quantify changes in user mobility and analyze how these changes affected cellular network usage and performance. Our analysis covers the entire country, specific regions, and geodemographic area clusters, with a detailed focus on London. Our findings provide insights at different geo-temporal granularities, including a decrease in data traffic volume and radio network load, counterposed by a surge in conversational voice traffic.

## 1 Introduction
Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the virus quickly spread globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a Public Health Emergency on January 30, 2020, and a pandemic on March 11, 2020. In response, various countries implemented interventions, such as confinement, to reduce transmission. These policies led to significant changes in human mobility, affecting traffic patterns and operations in telecommunication networks.

This paper focuses on the cellular network of O2 UK, evaluating how changes in people's mobility impacted the MNO's traffic patterns. The first two confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UK were reported on January 31, 2020, in York. On March 16, 2020, the government recommended working from home, and on March 20, 2020, it closed schools, restaurants, bars, and gyms. On March 23, 2020, a national lockdown was imposed, banning non-essential travel and contact. London, with 27,000 positive cases by the end of May, was particularly affected.

Our main findings include:
- A 50% decrease in mobility across the UK during the lockdown, with no correlation to the number of confirmed cases.
- More significant reductions in densely populated urban areas compared to rural areas.
- Regional differences in relaxing mobility restrictions, with increased mobility in London and West Yorkshire in weeks 18-19.
- Approximately 10% of London residents temporarily relocated during the lockdown.
- A 25% decrease in downlink data traffic volume, correlating with reduced mobility and increased reliance on residential broadband for applications like video streaming.
- A 15% reduction in radio cell load, consistent with the surge in residential ISP traffic.
- Little change in uplink data traffic volume, offset by a 150% increase in 4G voice traffic (VoLTE).
- A 100% increase in downlink packet loss error rate for voice traffic in weeks 10 and 11, due to congestion in interconnection infrastructure, which reverted to normal levels after rapid network adjustments.
- Differing impacts on network usage in geodemographic area clusters, with more significant decreases in densely populated urban areas, especially in central London districts with seasonal residents and business areas.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the measurement infrastructure and dataset. Section 3 details the observed changes in mobility during the lockdown. Section 4 discusses the changes in MNO network performance parameters, focusing on the UK and London. Finally, we present related work and conclude the paper.

## 2 Dataset
### 2.1 Measurement Infrastructure
The cellular network under study supports 2G, 3G, and 4G technologies. Figure 1 illustrates the high-level architecture of the MNO, which can be simplified into three main domains: (i) the cellular device (smartphone), (ii) the Radio Access Network (RAN), and (iii) the Core Network (CN).

Our passive measurement approach uses commercial solutions integrated within the MNO's infrastructure. We monitor key network elements, including the Mobility Management Entity (MME), Message Sequence Chart (MSC), Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)/Serving Gateway (SGW), and Cell Sites. We collect control plane information for both voice and data traffic, as well as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for cell sites.

#### Cell Sites
Cell sites host antennas and RAN equipment, supporting multiple technologies (2G, 3G, 4G) and including multiple cells and sectors. We gather detailed information on each cell site, including location, available radio technologies, and KPIs for every radio sector, aggregated at postcode level or larger granularity.

#### Radio Interfaces
We capture and process logs from the lu-PS (3G) and Gb (2G) interfaces, which report on data packet transmissions and mobility management. For LTE networks, we capture logs at the MME nodes on the S1 interface, reporting on mobility and bearer management, and the S1-UP interface for data and voice events. We also capture logs from the lu-CS (3G) and A (2G) interfaces for voice events. For detailed specifications, see [1].

### 2.2 Data Feeds
From our measurement infrastructure, we capture various data feeds from the mobile network, aggregated at postcode level or larger granularity.

#### General Signaling Dataset
We collect signaling messages related to events triggered by MNO subscribers, including Attach, Authentication, Session establishment, Dedicated bearer establishment and deletion, Tracking Area Update (TAU), ECM-IDLE mode transition, Service request, Handover, and Detach. Each event includes anonymized user ID, SIM MCC and MNC, TAC, radio sector ID, timestamp, and event result code (success/failure). This information is aggregated at postcode level or larger granularity.

#### Devices Catalog
We use a commercial database to maintain a catalog of devices, including their characteristics and capabilities. This helps in understanding the types of devices and their impact on network performance.
