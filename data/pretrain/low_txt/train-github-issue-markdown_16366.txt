I am aiming to enable both "allowJs" and "Compile On Save" simultaneously. 

The "allowJs" option is configured within the `tsconfig.json` file, but it is not present in the IDE's TypeScript build settings. Conversely, the "Compile On Save" feature is available in the IDE (which is logical, as it pertains to the editor's functionality). However, this feature becomes disabled when a `tsconfig.json` file is detected.

Ideally, I would like the "Compile On Save" option to remain active in the IDE, regardless of whether a `tsconfig.json` file is present or not. This way, even if other options that are passed to the compiler are unavailable, the "Compile On Save" functionality can still be utilized.
