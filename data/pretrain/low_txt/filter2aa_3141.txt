## Introduction

### What is the Point?
- **Target Audience:**
  - Small organizations with limited budgets and resources.
  - Teams facing unreasonable expectations.
- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Simplicity is crucial for effective security.
  - If you don't understand a system, it is not secure.
  - Don't be intimidated by your own systems.

### About the USMMA
- **What is the USMMA?**
  - The USMMA trains merchant marine officers.
  - It is part of the Department of Transportation.
  - Known for operating large ships.
  - It is the smallest of the five U.S. undergraduate service academies.
  - Not to be confused with the Navy, Coast Guard, or Marines, though graduates may join these services.

### About the CDX
- **What is the CDX?**
  - An annual, week-long information security event for students from various military institutions.
  - Participating institutions include:
    - Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT)
    - Naval Postgraduate School (NPS)
    - Royal Military College of Canada (RMC)
    - United States Air Force Academy (USAFA)
    - United States Coast Guard Academy (USCGA)
    - United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA)
    - United States Military Academy (USMA)
    - United States Naval Academy (USNA)
- **CDX Activities:**
  - Teams are given a mock budget to secure a poorly configured or compromised network.
  - They manage email, instant messaging, database, and web servers, workstations, and a domain controller.
  - Teams must administer the network while under live attacks from the NSA Red Team.
  - They handle exercise "injects" such as forensics, help-desk requests, DNS, and network reconfigurations.
  - Reporting requirements are also part of the challenge.

## Network Design

### Overview of Network Design
- **Review of USMMA Network Design:**
  - **Principle:** Keep It Simple Sailor (KISS).
  - **Design Considerations:**
    - Cost trade-offs
    - Administrative trade-offs
    - Monitoring trade-offs
    - Mistakes made and last-minute course corrections

## Quick Guides

### Operating Systems
- **Learn Multiple OSes:**
  - Variety is beneficial.
  - Examples: Ubuntu, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, MacOS, DSL, etc.
  - Refer to NSA guides for secure configurations: [NSA Security Configuration Guides](https://www.nsa.gov/ia/guidance/security_configuration_guides/)
- **Windows:**
  - Use Group Policies, but avoid overcomplicating them.
  - Windows Vista is acceptable for security purposes.

### Tools
- **Simple Tools are Useful:**
  - SysInternals
  - Firewall/IDS: Internal Firewall, Core Force
  - Anti-virus Scanner: Ad-Aware, AVG (use judiciously)
  - Pass-phrases vs. passwords

### Network
- **Network Layout:**
  - Logical and Physical
  - VLANs or Real LANs (suitable for small networks)
- **Firewall/Gateway Applications:**
  - m0n0wall
  - IPCop
  - Untangle
  - pfSense

### Application Servers
- **Application Server Tools:**
  - eBox
  - Webmin
  - Untangle

### FreeBSD
- **Donâ€™t Be Afraid of FreeBSD:**
  - Boris Kochergin's approach to teaching.
- **Using FreeBSD for Routing:**
  - Comparison with m0n0wall
  - NAT, VLANs, pf, and ipfw
- **Using FreeBSD for Application Servers:**
  - Comparison with eBox
  - Email, Webserver, Database, Jabber

## Summary
- **Key Points:**
  - With a small team and limited budget, simplicity is essential.
  - Use the simplest possible security, but no simpler.
  - If you don't understand it, it is not secure.
  - Security is about exploration; jump in and stay calm.
