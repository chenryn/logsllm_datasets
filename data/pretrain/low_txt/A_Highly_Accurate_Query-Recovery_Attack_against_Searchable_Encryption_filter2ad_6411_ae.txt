### Optimized Text

Our refined score attack achieves a recovery rate of 90% by utilizing documents similar to the encrypted ones. Previous attacks, such as those by Blackstone et al. [1] and Cash et al. [3], required the attacker to know a significant portion of the encrypted documents (ranging from 20% to 70%). In contrast, our attack avoids this strong assumption by requiring only a small number of known queries (approximately 10 in our experiments across various datasets). This approach is more realistic, as obtaining a few known queries through active attacks is more feasible than acquiring a substantial part of the indexed documents.

The effectiveness of our refined score attack increases with the amount of adversary knowledge. This sensitivity to information highlights an optimized use of adversary knowledge, which was not observed in previous attacks. We also demonstrated that existing countermeasures, such as padding and obfuscation, can effectively mitigate our refined score attack. Additionally, we found that the distribution of observed and known queries significantly impacts the accuracy of our attack. If the real query distribution differs from the uniform distribution commonly assumed in the literature, the refined score attack can be even more devastating.

Given these findings, we recommend that searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) should no longer be used without appropriate countermeasures.

### Extended Discussion of Related Work

#### A.1 General Overview

**Passive Attacks against L1 Schemes:**
Several passive attacks have been proposed to recover queries from L1 schemes, all assuming that the adversary knows at least a part of the indexed documents. For example, Islam et al. [15] introduced the first attack using co-occurrence of search tokens, while Cash et al. [3] presented a simpler but effective known-data attack. However, these attacks require significant knowledge of the indexed data. Other notable attacks include the graph-matching attack by Pouliot and Wright [28], and the binary sequence comparison attack by Ning et al. [22]. Despite their effectiveness, these attacks are limited to known-data scenarios and do not perform well with similar data. In contrast, our refined score attack avoids the need for partial knowledge of the encrypted documents and instead exploits a small subset of queried keywords, making it more feasible and practical.

**Other Attacks:**
Additional attacks exist against L1 schemes, such as the active attack by Zhang et al. [35] and the query frequency-based attack by Liu et al. [20]. These attacks differ from passive attacks and often require different assumptions. For instance, Oya and Kerschbaum [23] introduced an attack that combines co-occurrence and query frequency, working on schemes with no or partial access pattern leakage. Several articles have also presented attacks on less secure schemes (L2, L3, or L4 leakage profiles) and on schemes supporting range queries.

#### A.2 Relation between Substitution Cipher Cryptanalysis and SSE Attacks

There is a notable link between SSE passive query-recovery attacks and the cryptanalysis of substitution ciphers. Cash et al. [3] define L4 leakage as full plaintext under deterministic word-substitution ciphers. We argue that this analogy holds for more secure schemes, including L1 schemes. In simple substitution ciphers, each plain letter is replaced by another letter, with the key being a dictionary. Similarly, in SSE with single-keyword search, a mapping can be constructed where {trapdoori : keyword j, ...}. The main difference is the larger alphabet size in SSE.

Ciphertext-only attacks on substitution ciphers typically involve frequency analysis, comparing n-grams from the ciphertext with reference n-grams from a large corpus. Methods like those in [6, 9–11, 30, 31] use digrams (letter-letter co-occurrences). This is analogous to the word-word co-occurrences used in attacks like IKK, CGPR, and our refined score attack. However, in L1 schemes, the co-occurrence matrix is symmetric, unlike digrams in substitution ciphers.
