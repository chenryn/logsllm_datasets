### Administrative Difficulties and Data Publication

Third, it is important to emphasize that we did not manually investigate all domains. Instead, we will publish the datasets where certificates were found to be different, allowing others to conduct further investigations.

### Certificate Issuers

We were particularly interested in identifying the most common certificate issuers, as these Certificate Authorities (CAs) are high-value targets due to the size of their customer databases. We analyzed the dataset TUM-Apr2011, which contained 30,487 distinct issuers. We then focused on issuers that appeared in at least 2,000 certificates. These issuers accounted for 135,011 certificates, representing more than half of all distinct certificates. Figure 15 presents the top ten issuers. It is worth noting that there are nearly 200 Root Certificates in the Firefox Root Store, and some CAs have multiple Root Certificates. Where possible, we identified issuers as companies with subsidiaries, but two entries, 'plesk' and 'localhost', are not companies. 'Plesk' indicates virtualization, and 'localhost' or similar entries are always issuers in self-signed certificates.

### Further Parameters

We also examined the serial numbers in valid certificates to check for duplicates from the same issuing CA. No duplicates were found in the last three scans: TUM-Apr2011, TUM-Nov2010, and TUM-Sep2010. This is a positive finding, as a certificate's serial number should be a unique identifier, especially for blacklisting in revocation lists.

Additionally, we investigated the use of X.509 Version 1, which is outdated and no longer recommended. The current version is X.509 Version 3. In November 2009, 86.01% of certificates were Version 3, and 13.99% were Version 1. By April 2011, 85.72% were Version 3, and 14.27% were Version 1. Although we initially thought this might be an artifact of measurement, we found that 33,000 Version 1 certificates had not been seen in any previous scan. None of these had valid certification chains, and 31,000 were self-signed. The largest issuer among the remaining was a Russia-based company.

### Certificate Quality and Trends

Despite some positive trends, such as increased key lengths and the phasing out of weak algorithms like MD5, the overall state of the X.509 infrastructure remains concerning. For example, many certification chains showed multiple errors, including expired certificates and missing Root Certificates. Additionally, a significant number of certificates were shared among a large number of hosts, even for high-profile web hosters. Often, the host names did not match the certificates. Extended Validation (EV) certificates, though offered by several CAs, do not seem to be widely used.

This situation contributes to user insecurity, as users often ignore warnings, thereby exacerbating the problem. Given that a few CAs are responsible for more than half of the distinct certificates, one would expect better management or at least easier cleanup.

### Positive Tendencies

There are some positive trends, however. More popular sites are more likely to support TLS/SSL and to present absolutely valid certificates. Key lengths and signature algorithms are generally not major issues, with short keys and MD5 being phased out. Over the past 1.5 years, the use of intermediate certificates has increased while chain lengths remain short, which is a good development. However, overuse of intermediate certificates can add complexity to the already intricate certification infrastructure.

### Passive Monitoring

Our passive monitoring data allowed us to evaluate negotiated properties of TLS/SSL associations, which cannot be obtained through active scans. Most connections use secure ciphers with acceptable key lengths, and key lengths are increasing over time. However, MD5 is still commonly used for Message Authentication Codes (MACs). While this is not currently critical, it should be discouraged and phased out.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, while there are some positive movements, they do not address the most pressing problem: the certification structure itself. The general state of the X.509 infrastructure remains problematic, with several critical factors, such as the validity of certification chains and correct host names, showing little improvement. This work, focusing on the top 1 million hosts and the PKI as accessed by users, highlights the need for urgent action.
