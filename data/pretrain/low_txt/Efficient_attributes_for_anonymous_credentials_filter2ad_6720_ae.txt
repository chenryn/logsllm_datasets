### 7. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we presented an extension to the Camenisch-Lysyanskaya credential system that features efficient encoding and proofs for binary and finite-set attributes. By leveraging coprime and divisibility properties in proofs, we achieve significant performance improvements. This approach requires certifying prime/attribute value relationships in the issuer's public key, but it enables highly efficient proofs of possession, equality, AND, NOT, and OR statements.

Our method overcomes a fundamental limitation of existing credential systems: their complexity is linear in the total number of attributes. By folding many finite set attributes into a single attribute base, our system boosts the performance of all proofs of possession. For example, in a traditional CL system, a policy requiring 25 finite-set attributes and 100 OR-clauses would necessitate 25 commitments and 100 equality proofs, resulting in approximately 150 exponentiations. In contrast, our system would complete the same task with just 23 exponentiations, regardless of the policy. This efficiency holds for both pure conjunctions (only containing AND-clauses) and disjunctions (only containing OR-clauses), though the situation is more complex for nested logical statements.

Our method facilitates AND, NOT, and OR statements with constant complexity and minimal overhead to a standard proof of possession, without requiring additional cryptographic assumptions beyond Strong-RSA. It targets the major attribute classes in credential systems, recognizing that most attributes are either binary or taken from a finite set of discrete values. These attributes are essential for logical statements, and emerging efforts to standardize vocabulary for identity federation protocols support our hypothesis. We demonstrated the practical impact of our method on real-world applications such as electronic identity cards and complex forms of professional and medical credentials.

### APPENDIX

#### A. PROFESSIONAL TAXONOMIES

Virtually all professional organizations have elaborate taxonomies of expertise and attributes of clients and objects. Most taxonomies are hierarchically organized and benefit from statements at all granularity levels. Users can realize any sub-tree or path to a terminal leaf from the full taxonomy tree.

**Expertise**

Assume the ACM decided to issue credentials to their members, containing an expertise classification according to the ACM Computing Classification Scheme [2]. This well-known taxonomy is a tree with a depth of four, comprising eleven areas and roughly 1400 disciplines, sub-disciplines, and topics. To encode one path to a terminal leaf (e.g., "E. Data – 3. Data encryption – Public key crypto systems – PKI"), a traditional credential system would require four attribute bases. If a member can choose three expertise areas, and the ACM allows a choice from sixteen general terms (a multivariate finite set), a traditional system would need additional bases. The total number of required bases is proportional to the depth of the taxonomy times the potential attribute realizations, plus an offset for the multivariate finite set. Our prime-encoding can represent arbitrarily many attribute realizations in just one attribute base.

**PCCS Example**

Consider a user who wants to prove the following policy:
- `expertise ⊃ {E.Data, 3.Encryption, E.3.PKI}`
- `expertise ⊃ {D.SW, 4.OS, 4.6.Security, 4.6.Auth}`
- `general ⊃ {performance, security}`

This policy asks for a conjunction proof over all these attributes. Our system encodes the proof as a single multi-element AND-proof integrated into the proof of possession. Table 4 compares the complexity of different encodings.

| Parameter | Number of Attribute Bases | Exp. Proof of Possession | MExp. in AND-proof for PCCS | Exp. in AND-proof for PCCS |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| CL        | 28                       | 32                       | 1                            | 32                         |
| Prime     | 1                        | 1                        | 1                            | 5                          |

**Medical Records**

Our new credential system significantly impacts healthcare and medical record credentials. Healthcare practitioners classify diseases according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) [43, 44], a taxonomy tree with a depth of five: chapters, sub-chapters, sections, classes, and subclasses. Similarly, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) [1, 42] is a taxonomy tree of depth five, classifying mental disorders according to five axes, 16 categories, subcategories, disorder classes, and subclasses.

To encode a single path in such a taxonomy in a traditional credential system, one would require five attribute bases per realized terminal leaf. There is a clear need for specifying multiple symptoms or potential diagnoses. Even though healthcare cards are still in their infancy, there are debates on storing certified medical data on such cards, which is very privacy-sensitive. Our proposal allows for selective disclosure of medical information according to standardized taxonomies with variable granularity.

Implementing this on smart cards with traditional credential systems is virtually impossible due to the growing number of attribute bases, which would render any proof of possession inefficient. Our system allows encoding many realizations of deep taxonomies within a single attribute base, offering strong performance improvements.

**PMED Example**

Assume a user holds a certified diagnosis credential that may reserve five possible paths in the taxonomy. The policy PMED demands proving that one of the diagnoses matches one of 25 bacterial disease classes eligible for acquiring broad-spectrum antibiotics. It is highly desirable to hide the actual diagnosis in certain applications, so the proof must be done with an OR-proof without disclosing the actual disease. Table 5 compares the complexity of different encodings.

| Parameter | Number of Attribute Bases | Exp. Proof of Possession | MExp. in OR-proof for PMED | Exp. in OR-proof for PMED |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| CL        | 25                       | 28                       | 28                         | 83                        |
| Prime     | 1                        | 1                        | 9                          | 23                        |

**Classification Examples**

- **ICD Example**: "I. Determined infectious and parasitic diseases – Infectious diseases (A) – Infectious abdominal diseases (A00–A09) – A01.- Typhus-alike – A01.2 Paratyphus B"
- **DSM Example**: "Axis I – 13. Sleep disorders – Parasomnias – Sleepwalking"
