### Enabling the PPJ Briefly for Meter Reading

High-frequency measurements (e.g., Msps) are required for transient techniques [31, 32], while steady-state methods utilize low-frequency measurements and perform edge detection to identify appliances [26, 33]. Recent research has explored power consumption in the frequency domain [34], enhancing the capabilities of traditional transient solutions by differentiating between similar appliances. We used prior work [26] to evaluate the privacy breach of AMR meters.

### Consumer Privacy in Load Monitoring

Researchers have investigated privacy leakage through NILM systems. Mikhail et al. [5] proposed a method to infer residents' activities from demand-response systems. They first employed an existing NILM algorithm to recognize the running time schedules of various appliances. Then, extraction routines were used to determine occupancy schedules, sleeping cycles, and other activities. In their earlier work [4], they examined the impact of sampling rate on the accuracy of personal activity inference, showing that even with a 20-minute time resolution, attackers could still estimate user activities with 70% accuracy. Our work complements theirs by proposing several practical attacks on deployed electric meters (both visual and RF-based) for acquiring consumption data, which can serve as input to their study. To preserve consumer privacy from load monitoring, a protection system called NILL was recently proposed [35], using an in-residence battery to mask load variance to counter potential invasions of privacy. We believe our defense strategies against wireless attacks can complement NILL.

### Reverse Engineering

Researchers have used reverse engineering to expose security loopholes in systems designed with security by obscurity. Rouf et al. [36] used this methodology to discover security and privacy risks in tire pressure monitoring systems. Nohl et al. [37] used reverse engineering to reveal ciphers from a cryptographic RFID tag without known software or micro-code implementation. With some prior knowledge of the cipher, researchers used a black-box approach [38, 39] for cryptanalysis. Bortolozzo et al. [40] used reverse engineering to extract sensitive cryptographic keys from commercially available tamper-resistant security tokens by exploiting vulnerabilities in their RSA PKCS#11 based APIs.

### Attacks on Wireless Channels

Checkoway et al. [41] analyzed the vulnerabilities of automotive short-range (Bluetooth) and long-range (cellular) wireless communications. Francillon et al. [42] demonstrated relay attacks against keyless entry systems, and [43, 38, 44] also conducted attacks on RFID-based protocols used by engine immobilizers to identify the presence of an owner's ignition key. Clark et al. [45] analyzed the security of P25 systems against both passive and active adversaries, showing that even when encryption is used, much of the basic metadata is sent in the clear and is directly available to a passive eavesdropper. The AMR systems studied in this paper differ in several aspects from previously studied systems.

### Defensive Jamming

Defensive jamming has been proposed to protect medical devices [46]. Although sharing similar concepts, AMR meters involve a different physical layer technology (frequency hopping), making jamming more challenging. Unlike prior work [46], our focus is to provide insights from both attack and defense perspectives.

### Conclusion

AMR systems utilizing low-power radio frequency (RF) communications have been widely deployed for automatically collecting utility consumption data. This work shows that currently deployed AMR systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks and privacy breaches. Despite using frequency hopping, we were able to reverse engineer their communication protocol and launch spoofing attacks against a representative meter reader. Surprisingly, we found that AMR meters broadcast readings every 30 seconds, regardless of whether any 'drive-by' or 'walk-by' meter readers are in range, and the communication range is larger than expected. Through wireless monitoring, we harvested consumption data from 485 meters within a 300-meter radius, indicating that millions of installed meters are at risk.

A few standard security remedies are available to address these vulnerabilities, but none are adopted in the deployed AMR meters we studied. Adding these remedies to existing meters requires upgrading, which may be costly. An alternative scheme, called PPJ, utilizes jamming to protect against the leakage of legacy devices and requires no modification of deployed meters. Our pilot experiments offer a proof-of-concept that PPJ can prevent information leakage from AMR meters.
