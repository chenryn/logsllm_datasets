### Throughput and Overhead Analysis
The throughput of EnclavePDP remains within the same order of magnitude as that of the native PDP, indicating that the overhead introduced by EnclavePDP is acceptable for practical deployment.

#### Provable Data Possession (PDP) Schemes
Numerous data integrity verification schemes have been proposed, including [7–16], [30, 45, 46]. Among these, SEPDP [10], DPDP [7], and FlexDPDP [8] support the verification of dynamic data. Mirror [16], CPOR [12], and Iris [31] extend PDP schemes to provide data integrity verification with data recovery in case of corruption, known as proof of retrievability (POR) schemes. [11, 30] focus on the integrity check of static data for multiple copies. PPPAS [19], DHTPA [18], and Qruta [14] propose privacy-preserving auditing schemes using third parties. Several literature surveys (e.g., [25–29]) offer comprehensive summaries and comparisons of existing PDP schemes, defining a taxonomy. However, these surveys primarily focus on summarizing existing PDP schemes without providing practical implementations or evaluations on real-world cloud storage servers.

#### Securing Cloud Storage Systems
DEPSKY [47] proposes a cloud-of-clouds storage system, storing data across multiple cloud services to enhance data integrity and retrievability. Depot [48] designs a cloud storage system to ensure the consistency of operations on data and protects data integrity by preventing unauthorized access. While DEPSKY [47] still trusts the cloud storage platforms, Depot [48] focuses on consistency and availability. CloudProof [49] uses cryptographic keys to create access control policies, allowing users to detect and prove integrity violations to a third party, ensuring security guarantees for SLAs (Service Level Agreements) and compensations in case of cloud misbehavior.

#### Intel SGX-based Approaches
LibSEAL [37] presents a secure audit library to detect service integrity violations (e.g., Git operations) by creating non-repudiable audit logs protected by Intel SGX. LibSEAL is implemented as a TLS library and is not suitable for verifying data integrity. EnclaveDB [50] is a secure database that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data and queries by placing sensitive data (tables, indexes, and other metadata) in an Intel SGX enclave. DelegaTEE [51] designs a brokered delegation scheme, utilizing SGX for users to securely delegate their credentials of service providers to others. Ohrimenko et al. [52] rely on SGX to perform privacy-preserving machine learning on collaborative data owned by multiple parties.

### 8. Conclusion
To enable users to independently and confidentially verify the integrity of their outsourced data on cloud storage servers, we present EnclavePDP, a general framework that utilizes Intel SGX for data integrity verification. We tailored the Intel SGX SSL library and ported PBC libraries into Intel SGX. Ten representative PDP schemes were implemented based on the EnclavePDP framework. We deployed EnclavePDP on a real-world cloud application (FastDFS) to evaluate its practicality. The experimental results show that EnclavePDP introduces a reasonable runtime overhead for different file sizes, making it feasible to deploy with existing cloud storage services via its convenient interfaces.
