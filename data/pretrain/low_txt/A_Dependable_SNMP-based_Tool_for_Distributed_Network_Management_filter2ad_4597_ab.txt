### Dependable Distributed Network Management System

This paper presents a dependable, distributed network management tool based on the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and accessible through a web interface. The system utilizes the public-domain SNMP toolkit, NET-SNMP [15], to implement the Management Information Base (MIB). A web interface allows the human manager to determine which monitored elements are faulty and which are fault-free. This interface periodically retrieves diagnostic information from one of the agents, which can be configured online.

#### 4. Experiments

Two types of experiments were conducted to evaluate the system: network monitoring and a fault-tolerant network application.

##### 4.1. Network Monitoring

Practical results were obtained from distributed system monitoring over several months. Artificial events were injected to validate the implementation and to compute the latency in seconds, which is more intuitive than theoretical testing rounds.

**First Set of Experiments:**
- **Setup:** 500 experiments where one random fault-free node was crashed through fault injection and later repaired.
- **Crash Procedure:** Killing the associated agent.
- **Latency Computation:** Latency for all fault-free nodes to determine the fault and repair events.

**Table 1. Latency in Seconds to Fully Diagnose an Event on One Node**

| Event | Min (s) | Mean (s) | Max (s) |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|
| Fault | 59      | 124.5    | 345     |
| Repair| 69      | 121      | 297     |

**Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):**
- Up to 90% of fault events were diagnosed within 150 seconds.
- Up to 90% of repair events were diagnosed within 158 seconds.

**Second Set of Experiments:**
- **Setup:** 700 experiments where a random number of fault-free nodes were crashed and later repaired.
- **Latency Computation:** Latency for all fault-free nodes to diagnose multiple fault and repair events.

**Table 2. Latency in Seconds to Fully Diagnose Events on Multiple Nodes**

| Event | Min (s) | Mean (s) | Max (s) |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|
| Fault | 43      | 182      | 381     |
| Repair| 43      | 125      | 338     |

**Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):**
- Up to 90% of fault events were diagnosed within 241 seconds.
- Up to 90% of repair events were diagnosed within 148 seconds.

**Observations:**
- The observed diagnosis latency was much lower than the theoretical maximum of 2128 rounds (approximately 490 seconds).
- The mean latency for diagnosing one event was around 2 minutes.
- The mean latency for diagnosing multiple simultaneous events was around 3 minutes.
- These results demonstrate that the tool provides a practical solution for dependable LAN monitoring.

**Demonstration:**
- Accessing the actual laboratory via the web and executing an experiment where a random node becomes faulty through fault injection, and fault-free agents diagnose the event.

##### 4.2. A Fault-Tolerant Web Server

The dependable network management system was used to implement a fault-tolerant Apache HTTP server. As the web becomes a critical application, it is essential to ensure its availability.

**Setup:**
- A group of machines, each capable of running the server.
- The server runs on one machine with a virtual IP address.
- The virtual IP address follows the Apache server, assigned to any host currently executing the server.
- Each machine monitors the MIB to find the fault-free member with the lowest identifier.
- If the identifier matches, the machine assigns the virtual IP address to itself and starts the Apache server.
- Group members keep web files updated using tools like rsync.

**Experiment:**
- Conducted on six machines for 12 hours and 23 minutes.
- Each host crashed multiple times, with the probability of each machine working ranging from 13% to 66%.
- The Apache server crashed 74 times.

**Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):**
- The web service was available for 97.35% of the time.
- The mean interval in which the service was not available was 16 seconds.

**Demonstration:**
- Accessing the laboratory via the web, crashing the web server through fault injection, and having fault-free agents diagnose the event and start another web server.
- Simultaneously, accessing the web server's contents via a second browser to show periods of availability and unavailability.

### 5. Conclusions

Network management systems provide the framework for network control and monitoring. This paper presented a dependable, distributed network management tool based on SNMP and accessible through a web interface. The tool has been used for several months to monitor part of the Computer Science Laboratories at the Informatics Department of the Federal University of Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil. Experimental results showed that with a testing interval of 10 seconds, the mean latency for diagnosing one event was around 123 seconds, and for multiple events, around 154 seconds. These results indicate that the tool is a practical solution for dependable LAN monitoring. Future work includes creating a framework for building any distributed fault-tolerant applications on top of distributed diagnosis.
