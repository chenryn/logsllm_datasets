### Kerberos Delegation and Security Considerations

#### Overview
- **Relatively Easy to Exploit**: Kerberos delegation can be easily automated and is often not closely monitored.
- **Focus on High Privileges**: Malicious Just-In-Time (JIT) administration can exploit high-privilege accounts.

#### Kerberos Protocol
- **Ticket-based Authentication**: Kerberos uses a ticket-based authentication protocol involving the following components:
  - **Domain User**
  - **Authentication Service (AS)**
  - **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)**
  - **Key Distribution Center (KDC)**
  - **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)**
  - **Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)**
  - **Encryption Algorithms**: AES256, AES128, RC4, DES
  - **Service Ticket (ST)**

#### Delegation Scenarios
- **Why?**
  - Applications may reuse user credentials, such as a web server accessing a SQL database.
- **How?**
  - The web server requests tickets on behalf of the user.
  - **Example**:
    - **User1** authenticates to the **Web Server**.
    - The **Web Server** requests a ticket from the **Domain Controller (DC)**.
    - The **Web Server** then uses this ticket to access the **SQL Server**.

- **Delegation Types**:
  - **Kerberos Only (S4U2Proxy)**: Delegates to any service.
  - **Protocol Transition (S4U2Self + S4U2Proxy)**: Allows for protocol transition and delegation.

#### Privileged Access and Attacks
- **Accounts with High Privileges**:
  - These accounts are valuable targets for attackers.
  - **JIT Administration**:
    - High privileges are granted for a limited time.
    - Reduces the attack surface by revoking privileges after the operation.
- **Malicious Operations**:
  - Gain administrative access temporarily.
  - Perform malicious actions.
  - Remove traces to avoid detection.

#### Delegation and AdminSDHolder
- **Delegation Scenarios**:
  - **AdminSDHolder Scenario 1** and **Scenario 2**.
- **Access Control**:
  - **Object Ownership**
  - **Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)**
  - **Access Control Entries (ACEs)**
  - **User Rights**
  - **Access Token**
  - **Deny ACEs and Allow ACEs**
  - **Inherited Deny ACEs and Inherited Allow ACEs**

#### Attack Vectors
- **Add a New Machine Account**:
  - Set the machine owner to a malicious account.
  - The owner can edit the ACL of the object.
- **GPO Tampering**:
  - Enable accounts to be trusted for delegation.
- **DACL Modification**:
  - Add a 'GenericAll' ACE for a malicious user on the new machine.
- **Allow Delegation to krbtgt**:
  - Request an 'Administrator' TGT.
  - Remove footprints by reverting ACLs and removing delegation.

#### Persistence
- **ACL Modification**:
  - Modify the ACL of privileged groups like 'Domain Admins'.
- **AdminSDHolder Protection**:
  - SDProp overrides the ACLs of protected groups and users with the AdminSDHolder ACL.
  - Runs periodically (default: 1 hour).
  - Protected accounts include:
    - Enterprise Admins
    - Domain Admins
    - Administrators

#### Excluding Groups from AdminSDHolder
- **Groups that Can Be Excluded**:
  - **Account Operators**: Binary Value 0001, Hexadecimal Value 1
  - **Server Operators**: Binary Value 0010, Hexadecimal Value 2
  - **Print Operators**: Binary Value 0100, Hexadecimal Value 4
  - **Backup Operators**: Binary Value 1000, Hexadecimal Value 8

- **Steps**:
  - Add ACEs to excluded groups.
  - SDProp will not affect the new ACL.
  - Change the owner of the AdminSDHolder object.
  - Add the malicious user to the AdminSDHolder ACL just before SDProp runs.
  - SDProp adds the malicious ACE to protected objects.
  - Add the malicious user to the 'Domain Admins' group, obtain an administrative TGT, and revert changes.
  - Force SDProp to run to remove the malicious ACE from protected groups.
  - Remove the malicious user from the 'Domain Admins' group.
  - Automate the entire operation to run in seconds.

#### Mitigation and Monitoring
- **Sensitive Accounts**:
  - 'Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated'.
  - GPO: 'Enable accounts to be trusted for delegation'.
  - Monitor accounts trusted for delegation.
- **Attributes to Monitor**:
  - 'AllowedToDelegateTo' attribute.
- **ACL Management**:
  - Manage ACLs, owners, and excluded groups to enhance security.
