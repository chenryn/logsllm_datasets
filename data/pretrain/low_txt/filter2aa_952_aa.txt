**Introduction**

The world of cybercrime, with its cloak-and-dagger tactics, often makes for compelling drama, particularly in the case of high-profile breaches caused by malware or other sophisticated attacks. However, behind the sensational headlines lie inherent vulnerabilities that make such attacks possible.

The Android ecosystem, with its vast array of device models, operating system versions, and unique software modifications, presents a significant challenge in managing these vulnerabilities. The earlier a vulnerability is introduced in the supply chain, the more difficult it becomes to fix. Addressing these issues requires intricate coordination among suppliers, manufacturers, carriers, and end-users, from the initial design to the final installation of patches. This fragmentation leaves many users exposed to risks, even with brand-new devices.

In this report, the Check Point Research Team details four newly discovered vulnerabilities affecting over 900 million Android smartphones and tablets. If exploited, each of these vulnerabilities can give attackers complete control over the device and access to sensitive personal and enterprise data.

**QuadRooter: New Vulnerabilities Affecting Over 900 Million Android Devices**

QuadRooter is a set of four vulnerabilities affecting Android devices built on Qualcomm® chipsets. As the leading designer of LTE chipsets, Qualcomm holds a 65% share of the LTE modem baseband market.1

**What is Rooting?**

Rooting an Android device grants administrative control, allowing apps to execute privileged commands not typically available on factory-configured devices. An attacker can use these commands to perform operations such as modifying or deleting system-level files, adding or removing apps, and accessing hardware components like the touchscreen, camera, microphone, and other sensors.

If any one of the four QuadRooter vulnerabilities is exploited, an attacker can escalate privileges and gain root access to the device. These vulnerabilities can be exploited through a malicious app, which requires no special permissions, thus avoiding suspicion from users during installation.

The vulnerabilities are found in Qualcomm’s software drivers, which are included with their chipsets. These drivers, which control communication between chipset components, are incorporated into the Android builds developed by manufacturers. Pre-installed at the point of manufacturing, these vulnerable drivers can only be fixed by installing a patch provided by the distributor or carrier. Distributors and carriers can issue patches only after receiving fixed driver packs from Qualcomm.

The research team notified Qualcomm about these vulnerabilities in April 2016 and followed the industry-standard disclosure policy (CERT/CC policy) of allowing 90 days for patches to be produced before public disclosure. Qualcomm reviewed the vulnerabilities, classified them as high risk, and confirmed the release of patches to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

This affects an estimated 900 million Android devices manufactured by OEMs such as Samsung, HTC, Motorola, LG, and others. Some of the latest and most popular Android devices on the market today, including those listed below, use the vulnerable Qualcomm chipsets:

- BlackBerry Priv
- Blackphone 1 and 2
- Google Nexus 5X, 6, and 6P
- HTC One M9 and HTC 10
- LG G4, G5, and V10
- New Moto X by Motorola
- OnePlus One, 2, and 3
- Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge
- Sony Xperia Z Ultra

**Unique Vulnerabilities Affecting Four Modules**

Each of the four vulnerabilities impacts the entire Android system and affects the following modules:

- **IPC Router (Inter-Process Communication):** The `ipc_router` module provides inter-process communication for various Qualcomm components, user mode processes, and hardware drivers.
- **Ashmem (Android Kernel Anonymous Shared Memory Feature):** Ashmem is a proprietary memory allocation subsystem in Android that enables processes to share memory buffers efficiently. Devices using Qualcomm chipsets have a modified ashmem system, providing easy access to the subsystem API from GPU drivers.
- **kgsl (Kernel Graphics Support Layer) & kgsl_sync (Kernel Graphics Support Layer Sync):** The `kgsl` component is a kernel driver that renders graphics by communicating with user-mode binaries. The `kgsl_sync` module is responsible for synchronization between the CPU and applications.

**Fragmentation Visualized**

Several factors contribute to Android fragmentation, including different Android builds for various device makers, models, carriers, and distributors.

**Why Does This Keep Happening? The Supply Chain**

Suppliers, such as chipset makers, provide the hardware and software modules needed to manufacture smartphones and tablets. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) combine these modules, along with Android builds from Google and their own customizations, to create a unique Android build for each device. Distributors then resell these devices, often adding their own customizations and apps, creating yet another unique Android build. When patches are required, they must flow through this complex supply chain, a process that can take weeks or even months.

**Consumers May Be Left Unprotected for Long Periods of Time or Even Indefinitely**

Delays in patching vulnerabilities once they are discovered can leave consumers unprotected for extended periods. According to the Federal Communications Commission, "Consumers may be left unprotected for long periods of time or even indefinitely, by any delays in patching vulnerabilities once they are discovered."

**Recommendations**

Vulnerabilities like QuadRooter highlight the unique challenges of securing Android devices. Fragmentation places the responsibility of keeping Android devices and their data safe in the hands of a complex supply chain. Making patches and security updates available is resource and time-intensive, leaving users without protection while these updates are coded, tested, accepted, and distributed. In-market devices that cannot support the latest versions of Android may not receive important security updates, leaving them exposed to new vulnerabilities.

End-users remain poorly informed by retailers and employers about the risks associated with mobile devices and networks, including the risks of rooting, downloading apps from third-party sources, and using public Wi-Fi networks. These gaps not only put the user’s personal information at risk but also any sensitive enterprise information that may be on their device.

Stakeholders throughout the Android supply chain continue to explore comprehensive solutions to address these concerns, motivated by inquiries from the United States Federal Communications Commission2 and the Federal Trade Commission3, which have requested explanations from carriers and manufacturers for the broken Android security update process.

**Best Practices to Keep Your Android Devices Safe**

- Download and install the latest Android updates as soon as they become available. These include important security updates that help keep your device and data protected.
- Understand the risks of rooting your device, whether intentionally or as a result of an attack.
- Avoid side-loading Android apps (.APK files) or downloading apps from third-party sources. Instead, download apps only from Google Play.
- Carefully read permission requests when installing apps. Be wary of apps that ask for unusual or unnecessary permissions or that use large amounts of data or battery life.
- Use known, trusted Wi-Fi networks. If traveling, use only networks you can verify are provided by a trustworthy source.
- Consider mobile security solutions that detect suspicious behavior on a device, including malware hiding in installed apps.
