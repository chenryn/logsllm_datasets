# Third Workshop on Hot Topics in System Dependability (HotDep'07)

**Authors:**
- Miguel Castro, Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK
- John Wilkes, Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA

## 1. Introduction

The primary objective of the HotDep workshop is to highlight cutting-edge research ideas that bridge the domains of fault tolerance, reliability, and systems. It also aims to foster connections between the dependability and systems communities, such as those who attend traditional dependability conferences (e.g., DSN and ISSRE) and those who participate in systems conferences (e.g., OSDI, SOSP, and EuroSys). Previous HotDep workshop programs can be found at [http://hotdep.org/](http://hotdep.org/).

To achieve these goals, we assembled a program committee for HotDep'07 with a balanced representation from both communities. The committee members were:

- Marcos K. Aguilera, Hewlett-Packard Labs
- Lorenzo Alvisi, University of Texas at Austin
- Paul Barham, Microsoft Research, Cambridge
- Garth Gibson, Carnegie Mellon University
- Anne-Marie Kermarrec, INRIA, Rennes
- Petros Maniatis, Intel Research
- Armando Fox, University of California, Berkeley
- Ashvin Goel, University of Toronto
- Rick Schlichting, AT&T Labs
- Paulo Verissimo, University of Lisboa, Portugal
- Yuanyuan Zhou, UIUC
- Willy Zwaenepoel, EPFL, Lausanne

We received 22 submissions, which were reviewed by the program committee. A total of 118 reviews were written, with each paper receiving feedback from at least five committee members. After a meeting in Lisbon on March 23, we decided to accept 6 papers and 16 posters for presentation at the workshop. The accepted papers are:

1. **Delta Execution for Software Reliability**
   - Authors: Yuanyuan Zhou, Darkov Marinov, Craig Zilles, William Sanders, Joe Tucek, Marcelo D’Amorim, and Steven Lauterburg
   - Affiliation: University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign

2. **Reliable Device Drivers Require Well-Defined Protocols**
   - Authors: Leonid Ryzhyk, Timothy Bourke, and Ihor Kuz
   - Affiliation: NICTA and the University of New South Wales

3. **Large-Scale Byzantine Fault Tolerance: Safe but Not Always Live**
   - Authors: Rodrigo Rodrigues (INESC-ID and Tech. Univ. Lisbon), Petr Kouznetsov (MPI-SWS), and Bobby Bhattacharjee (Univ. of Maryland)

4. **Data Sanitization: Improving the Forensic Utility of Anomaly Detection Systems**
   - Authors: Gabriela F. Cretu, Angelos Stavrou, Salvatore J. Stolfo, and Angelos D. Keromytis
   - Affiliation: Columbia University

5. **Improving Dependability by Revisiting Operating System Design**
   - Authors: Francis David, Jeffrey Carlyle, Roy Campbell, Ellick Chan, and Philip Reames
   - Affiliation: University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign

6. **Classic Paxos vs. Fast Paxos: Caveat Emptor**
   - Authors: Flavio Junqueira (Yahoo! Research), Yanhua Mao, and Keith Marzullo
   - Affiliation: UC San Diego

The posters cover a wide range of topics, including operating systems, hardware, networking, security, and distributed systems. All accepted papers and posters will be published in a supplement to the DSN proceedings and made available online at [http://hotdep.org/2007](http://hotdep.org/2007).

We extend our gratitude to all the authors, the program committee, and George Candea (the chair of the steering committee) for their contributions to this successful program.
