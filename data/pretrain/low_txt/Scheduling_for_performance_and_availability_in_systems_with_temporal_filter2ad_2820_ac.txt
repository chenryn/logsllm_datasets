### 3.2 Exponential Service Rate Analysis

**Figure 6: CCDF of Round-Trip Times (RTTs) in a Network with M = 2, N = 500, and ACF1**

- **(a) Exponential Service Rate λ1 = 1**
- **(b) Exponential Service Rate λ1 = 2**
- **(c) Exponential Service Rate λ1 = 5**

The Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of RTTs is illustrated for different exponential service rates. The plots show the performance of three scheduling policies: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and SWAP.

#### Plot Details:
- **Exponential Service Rate λ1 = 1:**
  - FCFS, SJF, and SWAP policies are compared.
  - RTT values range from 1 to 1e7.
- **Exponential Service Rate λ1 = 2:**
  - FCFS, SJF, and SWAP policies are compared.
  - RTT values range from 1 to 1e7.
- **Exponential Service Rate λ1 = 5:**
  - FCFS, SJF, and SWAP policies are compared.
  - RTT values range from 1 to 1e7.

### 3.3 Sensitivity to Temporal Dependence

To analyze the effect of temporal dependence on policy performance, we conduct experiments with various autocorrelation profiles at QACF, while keeping the same mean and coefficient of variation (CV) of the job sizes. We use three service processes with autocorrelation profiles ACF1, ACF2, and ACF3.

**Figure 7: System Throughput under Different Autocorrelation Profiles**

- **FCFS, SWAP, and SJF Policies:**
  - Relative improvement over the FCFS policy is indicated on each bar.
  - For ACF1, ACF2, and ACF3, SWAP degrades the performance of only 3% of the total number of requests.

#### Key Observations:
- Stronger ACF (ACF1) degrades overall system performance more than weaker ACFs (ACF2 and ACF3).
- SWAP improves more under stronger ACF due to higher conditional probabilities for large-large pairs in the service time series.
- For ACF1, \( P[L|L]_j \geq P[S|L]_j \) for all \( j < 69 \).
- For ACF2, \( P[L|L]_j \geq P[S|L]_j \) up to \( j = 30 \).
- For ACF3, \( P[L|L]_j \geq P[S|L]_j \) up to \( j = 14 \).

### 3.4 Case 4: Sensitivity to System Load

We investigate the sensitivity of SWAP to an increased number of requests in the system. This is crucial to understand the performability benefit of the technique as the system reaches critical congestion.

**Figure 8: CCDF of RTTs under Different Temporal Dependence**

- **(a) ACF1:**
  - RTT values range from 1 to 1e7.
- **(b) ACF2:**
  - RTT values range from 1 to 1e7.
- **(c) ACF3:**
  - RTT values range from 1 to 1e7.

**Figure 9: System Throughput for Different Network Populations**

- **FCFS, SWAP, and SJF Policies:**
  - Relative improvement over the FCFS policy is indicated on each bar.
  - For N = 500, 800, and 1000, SWAP improves throughput by 33% compared to FCFS and achieves performance close to SJF.

**Figure 10: CCDF of RTTs for Different Network Populations**

- **(a) N = 500:**
  - RTT values range from 1 to 1e7.
- **(b) N = 800:**
  - RTT values range from 1 to 1e7.
- **(c) N = 1000:**
  - RTT values range from 1 to 1e7.

### Summary

- **Exponential Service Rate Analysis:**
  - The CCDF of RTTs is illustrated for different exponential service rates, showing the performance of FCFS, SJF, and SWAP policies.
- **Sensitivity to Temporal Dependence:**
  - Stronger ACF degrades system performance more, but SWAP improves more under stronger ACF.
- **Sensitivity to System Load:**
  - SWAP significantly improves throughput and RTT performance, especially under high load conditions (N = 1000).

This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the impact of different factors on the performance of scheduling policies in a network.
