### Additional Information
I have encountered this problem on both Ubuntu 18.04 and CentOS 8. The same functionality works correctly on Windows 10 and macOS 10.15.7.

- **Printer**: Brother QL-800 (thermal label printer, 62mm x 100mm)
- **Drivers**: Correct drivers are installed, and the printer is set as the default.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Manually setting the device name in the print options did not resolve the issue.
  - Replicated the problem with two other printers (another QL-800 and a QL-700).

**Problem Description:**
- `win.webContents.print` does not work on Linux when configured in silent mode.
- When `silent` is set to `false`, it works correctly.
- Printing test pages directly from the printer works fine.
- Printing to PDF works.
- `window.print` works.
- Behavior differs between Linux and Windows/macOS.

**Previous Versions:**
- In version 11.1.1, the printer inconsistently printed blank pages, which was also problematic.

Please let me know if I am doing something wrong or if you cannot replicate the issue. Thank you in advance for your help.
