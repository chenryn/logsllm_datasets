## Introduction
- **Android Overview:**
  - A software stack for mobile devices
  - 60,000 phones running Android ship every day
  - Ranks 4th among the most popular smartphone platforms
  - Limited research on rootkits for mobile devices
  - Based on Linux, an open-source OS with nearly 20 years of development
  - Extensive body of knowledge in Linux rootkits
- **Our Contribution:**
  - Created a kernel-level Android rootkit
  - Implemented as a Loadable Kernel Module (LKM)
  - Activated via a trigger number

## Introduction to Android – The Model
- **Source:** Google

## Introduction to Android – Linux Kernel
- **Based on:** Linux 2.6.x kernel
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer:**
  - Memory Management
  - Process Management
  - Security
  - Networking
- **Platform Position:**
  - Android platform sits atop the kernel
  - This is where our rootkit resides (more details later)

## Introduction to Android – Libraries
- **Core Functionality:**
  - SQLite: Main storage/retrieval (calls/SMS records)
  - WebKit: Browser functionality
  - SSL: Cryptography
- **Potential Exploits:**
  - Reading SMS messages
  - Intercepting browser sessions
  - Hooking the PRNG with static low numbers

## Introduction to Android – Runtime
- **Dalvik VM:**
  - Virtual Machine for Android devices
  - Runs applications converted into .dex format
  - Optimized for systems with low memory and processor speed
- **Focus:**
  - We did not spend much time here

## Introduction to Android – Applications
- **Application Framework:**
  - Core user functionality
  - Used by applications
- **Applications:**
  - User applications live here
  - Either pre-installed, downloaded from the Android Market, or self-installed
- **Focus:**
  - We did not spend much time here

## Introduction to Android – Other Notes
- **All Applications and User Activity:**
  - Utilizes Linux for I/O with hardware
  - Hijacking the Linux kernel allows control over all other layers
- **Advantages and Disadvantages:**
  - Complete end-user abstraction is a usability advantage but a security disadvantage
  - A successful attack only needs to subvert the application layer
  - Performance issues are often attributed to "bugs" and resolved by rebooting the phone

## Motivations Behind this Work
- **Market Statistics:**
  - 485 million devices on 3G networks as of Q4 2009
  - 10 billion devices expected by 2020
  - 60% of users carry their devices at all times
  - High-profile and business users almost always carry their devices
- **Processing Power:**
  - Modern smartphones have the same processing power as PCs from 8 years ago
  - Always-on network connectivity
  - Location awareness via GPS

## Motivations Behind this Work (cont’d)
- **User Behavior:**
  - Users access sensitive information via smartphones
  - Users trust smartphones over public computers or kiosks
  - Users rarely question the integrity of their smartphones
- **Government Access:**
  - Communication Service Providers (CSPs) must allow government access to subscriber communications
- **Case Study:**
  - In the UAE, Etisalat pushed a "performance update" to Blackberry subscribers, which was actually malware for intercepting data communications

## Motivations Behind this Work (cont’d)
- **Scope of Our Work:**
  - Not developing a new attack vector to get our payload onto the phone
  - Malicious app development is not our focus
  - Chose Android due to its Linux base and open-source nature
  - No personal issues with Google or Android
  - Appreciation for the OS, phones, and apps

## Building a Linux Rootkit
- **Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs):**
  - Allow dynamic extension of the OS kernel
  - LKMs have the same capabilities as code in the kernel
  - System calls are used for file, process, and other system interactions
