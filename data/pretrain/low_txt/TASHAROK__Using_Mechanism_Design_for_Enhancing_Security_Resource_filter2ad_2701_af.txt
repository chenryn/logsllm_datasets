### IX. Conclusion

In this study, we examined interdependent systems managed by multiple stakeholders that are susceptible to cyber-attacks progressing in a stepping-stone manner. We modeled these attack scenarios using a game-theoretic framework and captured the attack progression and system interdependencies through attack graphs in our proposed framework, TASHAROK. We then analyzed two types of tax-based mechanisms for our interdependent security setups, where a central regulator incentivizes defenders to achieve socially optimal security allocations.

Our analysis revealed that a mechanism designer cannot guarantee social optimality without providing financial incentives to defenders in all instances of our interdependent security games. We also demonstrated the impact of behavioral bias on the outcomes of the two mechanisms, showing that higher bias leads to increased tax payments. Furthermore, we explored the relationship between the tax amount and the voluntary participation of defenders, finding that behavioral defenders are more likely to participate in the mechanism even under higher tax payments compared to rational defenders.

We evaluated TASHAROK using four real-world interdependent systems, examining the effect of the mechanisms on social cost and the influence of behavioral decision-making on the mechanisms' outcomes. We compared the security cost achieved by TASHAROK's security allocations to those of four baseline solutions from the attack graph literature. Our results indicated that TASHAROK either matches or outperforms the baselines, even with rational defenders.

We believe that our study can help central regulators and defenders of interdependent systems gain a better understanding of their security risks, leading to more effective investment decisions to mitigate such risks, including those arising from cognitive biases. Future research could focus on characterizing achievable security allocations, associated mechanisms, and exploring attackers with cognitive biases.
