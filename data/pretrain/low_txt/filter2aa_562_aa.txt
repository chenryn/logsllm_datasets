## From Box to Backdoor: Using Old-School Tools and Techniques to Discover Backdoors in Modern Devices

### Overview
- **Introduction: Who, What, Why**
- **Moxa AWK-3131A WAP**
  - **About the Moxa AWK-3131A**
    - The AWK-3131A is an 802.11n compliant Wireless Access Point (WAP) designed for industrial environments.
    - It supports high-speed wireless communication with a range of features including Spatial Multiplexing MIMO, 20 and 40 MHz channels, and dual bands (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz).
    - The device operates in a wide temperature range (-25 to 60°C for standard models and -40 to 75°C for wide temperature models) and is rugged enough for harsh industrial conditions.
    - Installation is straightforward with DIN-Rail mounting or distribution boxes, and it includes LED indicators and IP30-rated housing.

  - **Summary**
    - An 802.11n WAP in a DIN-rail mountable enclosure.
    - Many internal components are similar to those found in common SOHO networking devices.
    - Moxa markets the AWK series as ideal for Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (AS/RS), which are common in Automated Materials Handling (AMH) systems.

  - **Device Limitations**
    - Limited to about 8,000 connections per unit of time.
    - Prone to resource exhaustion Denial of Service (DoS) issues.
    - Frequent crashes, often requiring reboots.
    - No legitimate operating system access.
    - Very limited shell environment, with most management and configuration done via a web application.
    - Vulnerable to various security issues, including CVE-2016-8723, which allows HTTP GET Denial of Service.

  - **Firmware Analysis**
    - Port scan and enumeration reveal open ports for SSH, Telnet, HTTP, HTTPS, and Moxa service agents.
    - Web application vulnerabilities include:
      - Nonce reuse (CVE-2016-8712)
      - Multiple reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-8719)
      - Command injection in the ping command (CVE-2016-8721)
      - CSRF vulnerabilities

  - **Backdoor Discovery**
    - The device has a hard-coded backdoor that sets the admin user's password to "root" and another user's password to "moxaiwroot".
    - This backdoor is embedded in an initialization binary that runs every time the device boots.
    - The backdoor can be exploited to gain root-level access to the operating system (CVE-2016-8717).

  - **Attack Summary**
    - **Freeze Nonce**: Exploit nonce reuse vulnerability.
    - **XSS**: Use reflected XSS to steal session tokens.
    - **Session Hijack**: Utilize stolen session tokens to hijack sessions.
    - **CSRF**: Perform Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
    - **Command Injection**: Inject commands through the ping function.
    - **Busybox Telnet**: Gain a shell via Busybox and Telnet.
    - **Root Backdoor**: Exploit the hard-coded backdoor to gain root access.

  - **Next Steps**
    - With OS root access, further actions can be taken, such as installing additional backdoors or using existing binaries to perform various tasks.
    - The file system is read-only, but all binaries and configurations can be extracted.
    - The device already has a backdoor, so additional installation is unnecessary.
    - Various binaries available on the device can be used for further exploitation.

### Conclusion
The Moxa AWK-3131A WAP, while robust and suitable for industrial applications, has several security vulnerabilities that can be exploited using old-school tools and techniques. By understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities, network administrators can better protect their networks from potential threats.
