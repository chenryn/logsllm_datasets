### The Value of a User's 'Virtual Identity'

A user’s ‘virtual identity’ is estimated to be worth between less than 1 USD and approximately 100 USD. This value varies significantly based on the wealth of the country where the user is located. A general rule of thumb is that for every tenfold increase in a user’s expected wealth (approximated by the country’s GDP), the profile value increases by approximately 1 USD. Cybercriminals particularly value profiles with access to cryptocurrency and money transfer platforms, which are priced, respectively, 10 USD and 6 USD higher than profiles without such access. To put this into perspective, these represent a 150% and 90% markup over the average profile price, highlighting the importance of these resources for cybercriminal activities. In contrast, access to social and other services does not seem to be as highly valued by cybercriminals.

### 6.1 Implications for Victimization

The systematization of impersonation attacks enabled by the IMPaaS model allows attackers to selectively target specific victim profiles and automate the attack process using dedicated software bundles that replicate the victim’s browsing conditions on the attacker’s environment. Unlike traditional phishing-based attacks, IMPaaS provides attackers with access to multiple platforms where a user is active, effectively allowing them to both mitigate security measures (e.g., by monitoring email for authentication codes or activity notifications) and extend the attack surface to different services (e.g., banking, social, etc.).

Attackers leveraging an IMPaaS platform can rely on an automated source for credentials to conduct sophisticated attacks at scale. In addition to gaining access to banking websites, cryptocurrency exchange platforms, and e-commerce sites, an attacker may compromise multiple accounts to gain control over the victim’s identity. The ability to select victim characteristics before acquiring a profile also enables targeted attacks against organizations or communities where the victim is an employee or registered member. The attacker can use this advantage to facilitate lateral movement attacks, targeting colleagues or family members of the victim using their legitimate contact details. Furthermore, the attacker can integrate additional information about the victim gathered through the accessed platforms (e.g., corporate affiliation, subscription to meeting websites) to escalate the attack to other victims.

### 6.2 Examples of (Alleged) Criminal Operations Enabled by ImpaaS.ru

To informally investigate how attackers are weaponizing capabilities enabled by IMPaaS, we collected examples provided by users of ImpaaS.ru on a Telegram channel linked to the platform. Many reported attacks focus on money transfer and commerce services. For example, one user claimed to have cashed out from a US bank using a synthetic fingerprint acquired on ImpaaS.ru and a geographically accurate SOCKS5 proxy. The user suggested using 911.re as the marketplace to buy proxies linked to specific ZIP codes and/or ISPs. Another user reported issuing a new debit card on behalf of the victim to cash it out through ATMs. Some ImpaaS.ru users also report performing multi-stage attacks through the obtained user profiles, exploiting multiple platforms. For instance, an attacker described setting filters in the victim’s email mailbox to hide notifications from Amazon related to purchases made using the victim’s account.

While these examples cannot be verified, the combination of infrastructural support for profile acquisition, selection, and enforcement enabled by IMPaaS opens up the potential for the systematization of such threat scenarios on a global scale.

### 7. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented the emergence of the Impersonation-as-a-Service (IMPaaS) criminal infrastructure, which provides user impersonation capabilities for attackers. IMPaaS allows attackers to bypass risk-based authentication systems by automatically simulating the victim’s environment on the attacker’s system. We characterized the largest currently operating IMPaaS infrastructure, ImpaaS.ru, through extensive data collection spanning more than 260,000 stolen user profiles worldwide. Our infiltration and data collection required substantial efforts to collect multiple accounts, as platform operators monitor crawling activities and blacklist related accounts. From our analysis, ImpaaS.ru emerges as a mature, expanding infrastructure with a clear pricing structure, indicating a well-established criminal business model.

Impersonation-as-a-Service represents an additional component of the cybercrime economy, providing a systematic model to monetize stolen user credentials and profiles.

### Lessons Learned

Our data collection efforts provide evidence that underground platform operators actively monitor crawling activities and take measures to limit them. This may prevent future research activities and significantly impact the possibility of conducting large-scale studies on cybercriminal online venues. Specific sampling strategies and analysis techniques will need to be developed to further advance research in this domain.
