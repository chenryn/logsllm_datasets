Since version 2.1.0, users have been unable to click or select items from a button dropdown menu on iPhones. This issue causes the dropdown menu to close immediately upon attempting to select an item. I have not been able to test this on other touch devices to confirm if the problem is iPhone-specific.

This issue can be consistently reproduced on the Bootstrap Sample Page:

To further troubleshoot, I also applied the fix from issue #4497, but it did not resolve the problem.
