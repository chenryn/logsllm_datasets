## Abstract
The CYSARM workshop aims to foster collaboration among researchers and practitioners to discuss the various facets and trade-offs of cyber-security. Specifically, it focuses on how new technologies and algorithms might impact the cyber-security of existing or future models and systems.

## CCS Concepts
- **Security and privacy**
  - Intrusion/anomaly detection and malware mitigation
  - Tamper-proof and tamper-resistant designs
  - Trusted computing

## Keywords
- Arms-Race
- Attackers and Defenders

## 1. Background
Cyber-security is a complex ecosystem that balances several often contradictory requirements. It is frequently described as an arms race between attackers and defenders. For example, a new security model or algorithm can be a double-edged sword, enhancing system security while also introducing new vulnerabilities. Similarly, many novel technological solutions designed to improve security are also exploited by those who wish to compromise well-established algorithms and protocols. For instance, large-scale quantum computers, when available, will be able to break most public-key cryptographic algorithms currently in use.

Security involves balancing multiple trade-offs, such as security vs. privacy, security vs. trust, security vs. usability, and security vs. cost. Artificial intelligence, for example, can efficiently analyze massive data streams to detect anomalous behavior but also threatens user privacy by enabling the analysis of individual behaviors. Trustworthy computing and trusted hardware fortify systems with stronger security and operational assurance, but they can also be used to perform stealthy attacks and damage user privacy.

## 2. Workshop Organization
For the second edition of the workshop, we received nine valid submissions. Each submission was reviewed by at least four TPC members using a double-blind review process. Three submissions were accepted for presentation, with two selected as Full Papers and one as a Short Paper, resulting in a full acceptance rate of 22.2% and an overall acceptance rate of 33%. Submissions came from researchers in fourteen countries, representing a wide variety of academic and corporate institutions. Due to health and safety considerations, CYSARM 2020 was held as a virtual event.

In addition to the presentations from the authors of the accepted papers, this year's CYSARM hosted a panel discussion with representatives from four EU H2020 project consortia. The panel discussed the impact of new technologies and algorithms developed within these projects on the security of future models and the various trade-offs involved in their design.

### 2.1 Objective and Topics of Interest
Topics of interest for CYSARM included:
- Advanced cryptographic techniques (e.g., post-quantum cryptography)
- AI and machine learning applied to cyber-security
- AI and machine learning applied to malware analysis
- Arms races and trade-offs in cyber-security (e.g., attackers vs. defenders, security vs. privacy, security vs. trust, security vs. usability)
- Double-edged sword techniques in cyber-security (e.g., artificial intelligence)
- Impact of quantum computing on cyber-security
- Intrusion detection and evasion, and counter-evasion
- Next-generation trustworthy computing security solutions and attacks (e.g., TPMs, TEEs, SGX, SE) and their impact
- Novel attacks and protection solutions in mobile, IoT, and cloud environments
- Security analysis of protocols, including the use of formal techniques
- Standardization of cyber security and trust techniques
- Validation of cyber-security technologies
