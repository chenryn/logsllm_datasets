### FTP Service in Mac OS X Server

#### Overview
Aliases cannot extend beyond the defined boundaries. The FTP service in Mac OS X Server extends the restricted environment to allow access to symbolic links while maintaining a secure FTP environment. You can grant FTP users access to the FTP root directory, their home directory, or any other directory on the server that you set up as an FTP share point.

A user's access to the FTP root directory, FTP share points, and their home directory is determined by the user environment you specify (as described in the following section) and by their access privileges.

#### FTP Users
FTP supports two types of users:
- **Authenticated Users**: These users have accounts on your server and may have their home directories stored on the server. Some FTP software refers to these as "real users." An authenticated user must provide a username and password to access server files via FTP. You can manage authenticated users using the Accounts module in Workgroup Manager.
- **Anonymous Users**: These users do not have accounts on your server and are also referred to as guest users. An anonymous user can access the FTP directories on the server files using the common username "anonymous" and their email address (which may be fictitious) as their password. You can enable anonymous access through the General pane of the FTP service settings in Server Admin.

#### The FTP Root Directory
The FTP root directory (or simply FTP root) is a portion of your server’s disk space designated for FTP users. By default, when you first install the server software, the FTP root is set to `/Library/FTPServer/FTPRoot`. You can change the FTP root; see “Changing the FTP Root Directory” on page 88.

#### FTP User Environments
Mac OS X Server allows you to choose from three different FTP environments, which give users access to some combination of the FTP root directory, other FTP share points, and user home directories:
- **FTP Root and Share Points**: This option provides both authenticated and anonymous users with access to the FTP root and any FTP share points to which they have access privileges.
- **Home Directory with Share Points**: Authenticated users log in to their home directories and have access to the FTP root via a symbolic link automatically created in their home directories. They can also access other FTP share points through symbolic links in the FTP root.
- **Home Directory Only**: Authenticated users are confined to their home directories and do not have access to the FTP root or other FTP share points.

Share points in this context are any share points you have set up in Workgroup Manager to be shared using FTP. Home directories are the home directories of users who have accounts on the server.

You can select the user environment for your server in the Advanced pane of the FTP service settings in Server Admin. See “Changing Advanced Settings” on page 85.

#### On-the-Fly File Conversion
The FTP service in Mac OS X Server allows users to request compressed or decompressed versions of information on the server. A file-name suffix such as `.Z` or `.gz` indicates that the file is compressed. If a user requests a file called `Hamlet.txt` and the server only has a file named `Hamlet.txt.Z`, it will deliver the decompressed version to the user.

In addition to standard file compression formats, FTP in Mac OS X Server can read files from either HFS or non-HFS volumes and convert them to MacBinary (.bin) format, a commonly used file compression format for the Macintosh operating system.

The table below shows common file extensions and the type of compression they designate:

| File Extension | Compression Type |
|----------------|------------------|
| .gz            | DEFLATE          |
| .Z             | UNIX compress    |
| .bin           | MacBinary        |
| .tar           | UNIX tar archive |
| .tZ            | Compressed tar   |
| .tar.Z         | Compressed tar   |
| .crc           | UNIX checksum    |
| .dmg           | Disk image       |

#### Kerberos Authentication
FTP supports Kerberos authentication. You can choose the authentication method using the General pane of the FTP service settings. See “Changing General Settings” on page 83.

#### FTP Service Specifications
- **Maximum number of connected users**: 1000 (default: 50 for authenticated users and 50 for anonymous users)
- **FTP port number**: 21
- **Number of failed login attempts before disconnection**: 3

#### Before You Set Up FTP Service
Consider the type of information you need to share and who your clients are when determining whether to offer FTP service. FTP is suitable for transferring large files such as applications and databases. Additionally, if you want to allow guest (anonymous) users to download files, FTP provides a secure way to do so.

#### Server Security and Anonymous Users
Enabling anonymous FTP poses a security risk because it opens your server to unknown users. The access privileges you set for files and folders on your server are crucial for maintaining security.

Anonymous FTP users are only allowed to upload files into a special directory named `uploads` in the FTP root. If this directory does not exist, anonymous users will not be able to upload files at all.

By default, anonymous users cannot:
- Delete files
- Rename files
- Overwrite files
- Change permissions of files

#### Setup Overview
Here is an overview of the basic steps for setting up FTP service:

1. **Before You Begin**: Read “Before You Set Up FTP Service” on page 81 for important considerations.
2. **Configure FTP General Settings**: Set banner and welcome messages, number of login attempts, and administrator email address. See “Changing General Settings” on page 83.
3. **Configure FTP Messages Settings**: Specify greeting messages. See “Changing the Greeting Messages” on page 84.
4. **Configure FTP Logging Settings**: Choose the FTP-related events to log. See “Choosing Logging Options” on page 84.
5. **Configure FTP Advanced Settings**: Change the FTP root and user environment. See “Changing Advanced Settings” on page 85.
6. **Create an Uploads Folder for Anonymous Users (Optional)**: Create a folder named `uploads` for anonymous users. See “Creating an Uploads Folder for Anonymous Users” on page 85.
7. **Create Share Points and Share Them Using FTP**: Use the Sharing module in Workgroup Manager to specify share points. See “Creating a Share Point and Setting Privileges” on page 22 and “Changing FTP Settings for a Share Point” on page 25.
8. **Start FTP Service**: Make the service available. See “Starting FTP Service” on page 86.
