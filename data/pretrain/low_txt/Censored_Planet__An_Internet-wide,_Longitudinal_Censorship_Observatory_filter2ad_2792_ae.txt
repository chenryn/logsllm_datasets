### Appendix: Evaluation

#### A.1 Anomaly Detection Evaluation

We conducted various trials with different thresholds for several anomaly detection techniques (§5.3.2). The Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) technique uses the deviation from the median as an anomaly score, while the likelihood model uses the likelihood of an element’s probability in a particular distribution. The Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) model calculates a weighted moving average over a sliding window and uses the deviation from the mean to assign anomaly scores. The Bitmap-based model discretizes the data into bitmaps and calculates the distance between two bitmaps as anomaly scores.

Our goal is to minimize the percentage of anomalies while maximizing the number of useful censorship events detected. This is challenging due to the lack of ground truth for censorship. Therefore, we manually compiled a list of ten key censorship events identified from Censored Planet data (described in §7.1) and observed how many of these events could be detected automatically at different thresholds for each technique.

The evaluation results are shown in Table 2. We report anomaly percentages for a time series drilled down to a per-category and per-country level, where the raw number of observations is in the order of \(10^6\) and the raw number of anomalies is in the order of \(10^4\) at the optimal level. While all detection techniques performed comparably, the Likelihood-based and MAD-based techniques consistently found a larger number of anomalies, likely because they detect smaller events during periods of minimal change. The EWMA and Bitmap-based anomaly detection techniques detected fewer anomalies. The Bitmap method performed slightly better, especially in finding most of the known censorship events. We report the top four events found using the Bitmap technique in Table 1.

Additionally, we observed an average overlap of 58.97% between comparable thresholds of the MAD, Bitmap, and EWMA techniques, indicating that a voting scheme may be used in the future to detect the most important anomalies. The anomaly detection process is online and fully automated, although there is effort involved in exploring the causes of censorship changes once the top anomalies have been identified.

#### A.2 Censorship Smoothing Evaluation

In §6.3, we evaluated the high variation in raw censorship values in countries with heterogeneous censorship policies, highlighting the importance of the smoothed representative censorship measure introduced in §5.2. Figure 10 shows that the smoothed censorship metric effectively reduces the volatility of the raw censorship values, providing a more stable and interpretable measure.
