This log chunk, spanning from 12:27 to 12:41 on November 10, 2008, documents the activities of the DataNode and NameSystem components within a distributed file system. Here is a step-by-step summary:

1. **Block Addition and Updates:**
   - The `dfs.FSNamesystem` component updates the blockMap with new blocks and their associated DataNodes. For example:
     - At 12:27:17, block `blk_-3170270010972115378` (size 67108864) is added to `10.251.66.63:50010`.
     - At 12:30:40, block `blk_-6247364168500873179` (size 67108864) is added to `10.251.203.149:50010`.
     - At 12:31:14, block `blk_4234385041723406944` (size 67108864) is added to `10.251.125.237:50010`.
     - At 12:32:37, block `blk_-8502460962248995911` (size 28489733) is added to `10.250.10.100:50010`.
     - At 12:33:09, block `blk_1389634598105954660` (size 67108864) is added to `10.251.214.32:50010`.
     - At 12:34:53, block `blk_-1435656632270396446` (size 28490269) is added to `10.251.42.9:50010`.

2. **Block Reception:**
   - The `dfs.DataNode$DataXceiver` component receives blocks from various sources. For example:
     - At 12:27:19, block `blk_6988110707613820142` is received from `/10.251.123.132:47658` to `/10.251.123.132:50010`.
     - At 12:30:12, block `blk_-2192382893903170466` is received from `/10.251.201.204:36915` to `/10.251.201.204:50010`.
     - At 12:38:10, block `blk_6628512193350164674` is received from `/10.251.73.220:33460` to `/10.251.73.220:50010`.

3. **Packet Responder Activities:**
   - The `dfs.DataNode$PacketResponder` component handles the reception and termination of packet responders for specific blocks. For example:
     - At 12:30:08, PacketResponder 1 for block `blk_-1490623381339215624` terminates.
     - At 12:31:32, block `blk_8968608251219902913` (size 67108864) is received from `/10.251.195.52`.
     - At 12:32:52, blocks `blk_-1201318815778694289` and `blk_-9089815063425241739` (both size 67108864) are received from `/10.251.194.147` and `/10.251.126.255`, respectively.
     - At 12:34:01, block `blk_557803157214911261` (size 67108864) is received from `/10.251.198.196`.
     - At 12:35:17, PacketResponder 2 for block `blk_7345322407792942877` terminates.
     - At 12:35:41, PacketResponder 1 for block `blk_-8939321760994370713` terminates.
     - At 12:35:43, PacketResponder 0 for block `blk_3958940914408609637` terminates.
     - At 12:38:27, PacketResponder 1 for block `blk_-5587827566367944828` terminates.

4. **Block Allocation:**
   - At 12:37:26, the `dfs.FSNamesystem` component allocates block `blk_5106303344783117537` for the file `/user/root/randtxt2/_temporary/_task_200811101024_0002_m_001968_1/part-01968`.

5. **Block Serving:**
   - At 12:41:58, the `dfs.DataNode$DataXceiver` component serves block `blk_-743349875664670637` to `/10.250.11.53`.

In summary, this log captures the dynamic process of block management in a distributed file system, including block additions, receptions, terminations, and allocations.
