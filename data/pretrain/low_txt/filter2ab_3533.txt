### Title: Black Hat US-23: Making and Breaking NSA's Codebreaker Challenge

For the past decade, the National Security Agency (NSA) has hosted the annual Codebreaker Challenge. This competition, designed and administered by NSA's technical experts, features a new theme and challenge each year. The challenges are meticulously crafted to simulate real-world problems that the NSA encounters in its mission. They consist of up to 10 rounds, with increasing levels of difficulty, including tasks such as code analysis and reverse engineering.

The program has seen exponential growth since its inception in 2013, when it involved just five schools. In 2022, more than 4,800 participants from 449 schools across the United States competed for top honors. Only 104 individuals (approximately 2%) successfully completed all nine rounds of the challenge.

For the first time at Black Hat, the NSA will publicly share insights and lessons learned from running the Codebreaker Challenge. We will present detailed information about the design of the 2022 challenge, which focused on the NSA assisting FBI agents in responding to a U.S. company crippled by a ransomware attack.
