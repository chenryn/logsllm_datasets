### User-Agent Spoofing and Bypassing Security Protocols

To access a system that required Internet Explorer, I had to change my user-agent in Firefox to mimic Internet Explorer, as I was using an Apple computer. This technique has proven useful in bypassing poor security protocols. For instance, during one investigation, I encountered a web forum associated with a hacking group that appeared blank when visited. Despite being indexed by Google, the content was not visible. By changing my user-agent to Firefox on a Linux machine, I was able to view the content. The group had implemented a script that only allowed specific user-agents to see the page.

**Note:** User-agent spoofing is not foolproof. Some websites use JavaScript to scan for additional identifiers like touch points and video cards, which can reveal the true details of your browser. A demonstration page at [https://intcltechniques.com/loggcr/](https://intcltechniques.com/loggcr/) can help you understand how some sites may bypass your spoofing. While this level of scrutiny is rare, it's important to be aware of what websites can detect about your setup before conducting sensitive investigations.
