### 2. Objectives
- Jailbreaking the iPod Touch/iPhone.
- Using the iPod Touch as a PenTest platform.
- Exploring the iPod Touch as an attack vector.
- Conclusion.

### 3. Jailbreaking
#### Legal Issues
- **EFF Proposed Exception**:
  - Class #1: Computer programs that enable wireless telephone handsets to execute lawfully obtained software applications, where circumvention is for the sole purpose of enabling interoperability.
  - Reference: [EFF Proposal](http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2008/comments/lohmann-fred.pdf)
- **DMCA Violation**:
  - Apple opposes the proposed Class #1 exemption, citing potential copyright infringement, device damage, and breach of contract.
  - Reference: [Apple's Response](http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2008/responses/apple-inc-31.pdf)
- **Outcome**:
  - The Copyright Office will decide in October regarding the exception.
  - Apple’s License Agreement remains in effect regardless of the outcome.

#### Jailbreaking Tools
- **QuickPwn.com**
- **Default Installations**:
  - Cydia
  - Installer
  - OpenSSH / TouchTerm

### 4. iPod Touch as a PenTest Platform
#### Operating System
- **Darwin Kernel Version 9.4.1**:
  - Open Source, POSIX compliant.
  - Includes code from NEXTSTEP and FreeBSD.
  - Compliant with Single UNIX Specification version 3 (SUSv3).
  - Conclusion: The iPod Touch is a UNIX system.

#### Package Managers / Repositories
- **Cydia**:
  - Port of Debian APT.
  - 30+ repositories.
- **Apple’s App Store**:
  - Download applications from the iTunes Store.

#### System Tools
- **Development Platform**:
  - GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).
  - Headers available via Cydia.
- **Scripting Languages**:
  - Perl, Python, Ruby (on Rails), and shells.
- **Network Tools**:
  - OpenSSH, Inetutils, Network-cmds, Wget, Stealth MAC, Stunnel, TCPdump.

#### Usability
- **Shell Window**:
  - 13 lines, 57 characters.
- **Keyboard Real Estate**:
  - Solution: Remote SSH (when possible).

### 5. Hacking with the iPod Touch
#### Statistics
- **SECTOOLS.ORG**:
  - 9 out of the top 20 tools, including Nmap.
  - JTR Benchmark: 
    - MacBook Pro 2.8 GHz Intel Core Duo: 7674 c/s real, 7690 c/s virtual.
    - iPod Touch: 577 c/s real, 617 c/s virtual.

#### Information Gathering
- **Tools**:
  - Safari, Nmap, System & Application Footprinting, Banner Grabbing, Telnet/Netcat, Verification & Enumeration of Nmap Results.

#### Vulnerability Identification
- **Missing**:
  - No vulnerability scanners (possible Nessus tunnel).
  - Grabs low-hanging fruit but saves time.

#### Vulnerability Exploitation
- **Tools**:
  - Metasploit (Exploit Code & Shellcode), Scapy (Packet Manipulation).

#### Web Hacking
- **Tools**:
  - Nikto (Web Server Scanner), Medusa (Application Access Brute Forcer).

#### Privilege Escalation
- **Tools**:
  - Pirni (ARP Spoofing and Network Sniffer), Berkeley Packet Filter, John the Ripper (Password Brute Force Attack), Medusa (Brute Force Network Authentication).

#### Maintaining Access
- **Tools**:
  - Netcat (Read and Write Data Across Network Connections), OpenSSH (Secure (Reverse) Shell).
  - Problem: Active Processes.

#### Demonstration
- **ARP Spoofing & Traffic Gathering**.

### 6. iPod Touch as an Attack Vector
#### Rogue System
- **Advantages**:
  - Small, compact, innocuous.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Power limitations, wireless only, $299 base price (more than an EeePC).

#### Social Engineering
- **Comparison**:
  - iPod Touch vs. Laptop.
  - Assumed to be a phone, unaware of its use as a hacking platform.
  - "Texting" is socially acceptable.
  - Compact and easy to hide.

#### Demonstration
- **Rogue System and Social Engineering**.
