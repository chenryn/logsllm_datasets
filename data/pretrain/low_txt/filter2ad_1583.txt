**On the Evolution of Adversary Models in Security Protocols: From the Beginning to Sensor Networks**

**Abstract**

Inevitably, new technologies introduce new vulnerabilities, which often enable attacks by increasingly sophisticated adversaries. However, new systems are typically more effective at mitigating well-known attacks from traditional adversaries than they are at anticipating and defending against new ones. Consequently, our adversary models frequently become outdated; they may fail to capture emerging attack vectors or address threats that have been rendered obsolete by technological advancements.

In this talk, I will provide a brief overview of the evolution of adversary models, starting with those required for program and data sharing technologies in the 1960s and 1970s, progressing through the models needed for communication and networking technologies in the 1970s and 1980s, and concluding with the models necessary for sensor network technologies from the 2000s onward.

I argue that sensor, ad-hoc, and mesh networks necessitate new adversary models that differ significantly from the commonly used Dolev-Yao and Byzantine models. To illustrate this point, I will present examples of adversaries that can successfully attack perfectly sensible and otherwise correct protocols in sensor networks. These attacks cannot be effectively countered using traditional end-to-end security protocols and design arguments. Instead, they require emergent security properties as countermeasures.
