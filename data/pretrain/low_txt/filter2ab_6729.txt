**Title: BlackHat US-19: All 4G Modules Are Vulnerable to Hacking**

In recent years, the integration of 4G modules into Internet of Things (IoT) devices has become increasingly common. These modules are found in a wide range of applications, including vending machines, car entertainment systems, laptops, advertising screens, and urban surveillance cameras. Despite their widespread use, comprehensive security research on these 4G modules has been lacking.

To address this gap, we conducted an extensive study, testing over 15 different types of 4G modules from major brands. Our findings revealed that all of these modules share similar vulnerabilities, such as:

- Remote access with weak default passwords
- Command injection via AT commands and listening services
- Over-the-Air (OTA) upgrade spoofing
- Command injection through SMS
- Web application vulnerabilities

These vulnerabilities allowed us to gain shell access to the devices. In addition to exploiting these vulnerabilities over Wi-Fi, we developed a novel attack method using a fake base station system. This approach, triggered by accessing the cellular network's intranet, enabled us to execute remote commands without any prerequisites.

During our presentation, we will provide an overview of the hardware structure of these 4G modules. We will then detail the specific methods we used to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities. Finally, we will demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can be leveraged to attack car entertainment systems and gain remote control of vehicles from various manufacturers.
