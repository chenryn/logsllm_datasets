### 5. Generalizability of the Approach

While our approach is specifically demonstrated in certain scenarios, it is generic and can be applied to other attack settings. An attacker may target either fine-grained (e.g., cache) or more coarse-grained (e.g., DRAM) channels.

### 12. Conclusion

TLBleed, a powerful and fundamentally new side-channel attack via the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), reveals that the problem of microarchitectural side channels is more profound than previously assumed. Until now, much of the security community has implicitly assumed that practical, fine-grained side-channel attacks are limited to CPU data and instruction caches, often leaving other shared resources out of the threat model.

In this paper, we have shown that TLB activity monitoring not only provides a practical new side channel but also bypasses all state-of-the-art cache side-channel defenses. Since the operation of the TLB is a fundamental hardware property, mitigating TLBleed presents significant challenges. It requires novel research to design efficient yet flexible mechanisms that isolate TLB partitions based on corresponding security domains. However, as new mitigations are developed, it is likely that new side channels amenable to practical attacks will emerge. As a broader lesson, TLBleed demonstrates that comprehensive side-channel protection must carefully consider all shared resources.
