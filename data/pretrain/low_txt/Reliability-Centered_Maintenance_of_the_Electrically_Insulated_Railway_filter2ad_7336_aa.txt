## Abstract
Maintenance is a critical factor in enhancing system dependability. Timely inspections, repairs, and renewals can significantly improve a system's reliability, availability, and lifespan. However, maintenance also incurs costs and planned downtime, necessitating a balanced approach.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of different maintenance strategies on the electrically insulated railway joint (EI-joint), a crucial component in railroad tracks for train detection and a frequent cause of train disruptions. In collaboration with maintenance engineering experts, we have modeled the EI-joint using a fault maintenance tree (FMT), which extends traditional fault trees by incorporating maintenance aspects. We demonstrate how FMTs can naturally model complex maintenance concepts, such as condition-based maintenance with periodic inspections, and how they enable the analysis of key performance indicators, including system reliability, failure rates, and costs.

The accuracy of our quantitative analyses depends heavily on the precision of the parameter values in the models. We were in a unique position to collect extensive data from incident registration databases and interviews with domain experts from multiple companies, allowing us to construct a model that accurately predicts the expected number of failures at the system level.

Our analysis reveals that the current maintenance policy is nearly cost-optimal. While increasing joint reliability through more frequent inspections is possible, the additional maintenance costs outweigh the reduced costs of failures.

## Introduction
Reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) [1] is a significant trend in infrastructural asset management, aiming to optimize maintenance policies by focusing more on critical components. RCM seeks to balance maintenance costs and system dependability by allocating maintenance efforts where they are most needed. To make informed decisions, RCM requires a thorough understanding of the effects of maintenance policies on system dependability, using key performance indicators such as system reliability, availability, and mean time between failures. This paper demonstrates how an integral analysis of dependability and maintenance can be achieved using fault-maintenance trees (FMTs) to study a typical infrastructural asset.

## Background
### Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)
Fault tree analysis (FTA) [2] is a widely used methodology for dependability analysis. When the failure rates of components are known, FTA can compute the probability of system failure. However, FTA does not account for the impact of maintenance, making it unsuitable for scenarios where maintenance policies vary.

### Fault Maintenance Trees (FMTs)
To address this limitation, fault maintenance trees (FMTs) [3] have been developed. FMTs combine fault trees with maintenance models, representing essential elements such as component degradation, inspections, and repairs. Additionally, FMTs introduce a new gate, the RDEP (rate dependency) gate, which allows the failure of one component to accelerate the degradation of others. This feature is crucial for accurately modeling the EI-joint.

FMTs support the calculation of important dependability metrics, such as system reliability, availability, mean time to failure (MTTF), and expected costs. These analyses are performed using statistical model checking [4], a Monte Carlo simulation technique [5].

## Case Description: Maintenance of EI-Joints
Electrically insulated joints (EI-joints, see Figure 1) are vital components in railroad tracks, facilitating train detection and protection by electrically separating track sections. They are a frequent cause of failures and service disruptions, making effective maintenance crucial.

### Purpose and Operation
Many railroad networks, including those in the Netherlands [13], use electrical detection to determine the presence of trains. This system works by detecting when the axles of a train short-circuit the two rails, as illustrated in Figure 2. Tracks are divided into electrically isolated sections, each with its own detection current and detectors. The interlocking system then locks switches and sets signals based on the detected train presence.

### Joint Construction
An EI-joint consists of a layer of insulating material placed between two rail sections, held together by fishplates and bolts. The insulating material prevents electrical contact, and additional sleepers provide support to prevent the joint from flexing and breaking.

### Failure Modes
EI-joints are subject to both mechanical and electrical failures. Mechanical failures, though rare, can have catastrophic consequences, while electrical failures are more common but generally not safety-critical due to the fail-safe nature of the detection system. Table I lists the most significant failure modes, their expected time to failure, and the probability of occurrence.

### Inspections and Repairs
ProRail's maintenance policy includes annual inspections followed by corrective maintenance. The type of corrective action depends on the fault. Some faults can be immediately repaired, while others require more general actions or complete joint replacement.

### Problem Statement
We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of FMTs in investigating maintenance questions for the EI-joint. Specifically, we want to determine if the current maintenance strategy is effective and efficient, meeting reliability requirements, being cost-effective, and whether improvements are possible.

## Methodology
We have modeled the EI-joint using fault maintenance trees. Below, we briefly describe the main components of this framework: fault trees, maintenance models, analysis methods, and metrics.

### Fault Trees
Fault trees (FTs) are graphical methods for performing reliability and safety analysis [2, 6]. They consist of basic events (BEs) representing component failures and gates (AND, OR, VOT(k)) describing how these failures propagate to cause system failure.

### Fault Maintenance Trees
FMTs extend FTs by incorporating gradual degradation, inspections, repairs, and rate dependencies. The FMT for the EI-joint is shown in Figure 3. Extended BEs in FMTs are more expressive, allowing for the modeling of complex maintenance policies.

## Results and Discussion
Our analysis shows that the current inspection policy is nearly cost-optimal, balancing the costs of failures and maintenance. While periodic preventive replacements can improve reliability, they are more expensive than corrective replacements. The optimal inspection policy does not vary much with the load level of the track.

An important contribution is the extensive validation of our model. By comparing predicted results with actual data from a failure database, we found strong agreement, providing confidence in our recommendations.

## Conclusion
FMTs are a useful framework for investigating maintenance optimization problems in industrial practice. They offer a convenient and expressive model, capable of capturing complex maintenance aspects and producing predictive analysis results.
