### Dyeing Technology and Regulatory Compliance

When researching dyeing technology, one may eventually find a useful contact who can provide information on relevant laws and standards concerning waste disposal. However, it is important to consider whether the focus should be on the law itself or its interpretation. Additionally, if the laws are from a different country, practices and terminologies may vary, which can complicate compliance.

### SEWASIE Architecture

The SEWASIE system is designed to provide users with a central interface for accessing various tools. These include:

- **Query Composition:** Tools for constructing and refining search queries.
- **Personalization:** Options for customizing search results and other web data.
- **Visualization:** Features for presenting search results in a clear and understandable format.
- **Communication:** Mechanisms for interacting with business partners, such as in electronic negotiations.

**SEWASIE Information Nodes (SINodes)** are mediator-based systems that offer a virtual view of the managed information sources. Each SINode exports an ontology that represents the metadata of its virtual view. These ontologies are integrated by **Brokering Agents**, which facilitate communication between the SINodes and the user interface. The user interface forwards queries to **Query Agents**, intelligent information agents tasked with resolving these queries. The Query Agents use Brokering Agents to gather metadata about the SINodes, identifying which nodes need to be queried to answer a specific query.

**Monitoring Agents** filter and contextualize the answers provided by the Query Agents, often linking them to OLAP reports. They also monitor competitor and collaborator websites. Finally, the **Communication Tool** supports structured web-based communication, using query results, contextualized information, and ontologies from SINodes as the basis for communicative content. The **Communication Agent** performs communication tasks during the early phases of electronic interactions.

### Results

Following the design phase and the parallel development of core modules (query management, ontology design, and user interface), the project successfully integrated the core and auxiliary modules into a first semantic search engine prototype. While several query types are already supported, more complex and subtle query formats are being explored to define common interpretations and query management policies.

Techniques have been studied and tested to enhance the workflow at the user, intermediary, and source levels. This is significant both from a design and development perspective, as it improves the overall ergonomics of the system. From an economic standpoint, deploying the system in a real work environment will require an enterprise or sector-level strategy to ensure that users perceive it as a useful tool, with a favorable cost-benefit ratio.

Extended features of the system include negotiation systems, OLAP systems, monitoring, and visualization components. These are being integrated with the basic search engine user interface to create an integrated user environment where sophisticated analysis and processing can be performed. User interaction can range from substantial, as in a negotiation system, to minimal, as in monitoring for specific events.

User testing is ongoing, and more tests are planned to validate the integrated system in increasingly complex and demanding environments. Initial test activities focused on the textile sector in the province of Modena, Italy, involving CNA and SMEs, and in collaboration with some medium-sized German firms. A second test plan is being finalized to focus on a high-tech mechanical industry (molding of plastic and metal).
