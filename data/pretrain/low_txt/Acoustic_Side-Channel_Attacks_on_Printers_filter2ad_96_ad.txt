## 6. Conclusion

We have introduced a novel attack that takes as input a sound recording of a dot-matrix printer processing English text and recovers up to 72% of the printed words. With contextual knowledge about the text, the recognition rate can reach up to 95%. After an initial training phase, the attack is fully automated and utilizes a combination of machine learning, audio processing, and speech recognition techniques, including spectral features, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and linear classification. Additionally, it supports feedback-based incremental learning.

We have identified and evaluated countermeasures suitable for preventing this type of attack. We successfully executed the attack in a real-world setting at a doctor's practice, recovering the content of medical prescriptions under realistic conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrated the relevance of this attack by conducting a representative survey, which revealed that dot-matrix printers are still widely used in sensitive areas, particularly by banks and doctors.

### A. Example Text with General-purpose HMM Post-processing

#### A.1 The Original Text
In computing, a printer is a peripheral that produces a hard copy (permanent human-readable text and/or graphics) of documents stored in electronic form, usually on physical print media such as paper or transparencies. Many printers are primarily used as local peripherals, and are attached by a printer cable or, in most newer printers, a USB cable to a computer which serves as a document source. Some printers, commonly known as network printers, have built-in network interfaces (typically wireless or Ethernet), and can serve as a hardcopy device for any user on the network. Individual printers are often designed to support both local and network-connected users at the same time.
