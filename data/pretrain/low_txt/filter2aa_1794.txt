### Network Traffic Transformations

#### Defcon 21

##### IPv4
- **IP ID Randomization:**
  - Exclude Fragments
  - Others: Randomize and Clear Outgoing "DF" (Don't Fragment) Flag

- **TTL (Time to Live) Standardization:**
  - Exclude ICMP Echo Requests and Routing Protocols (RIP, BGP)
  - Others: Account for Hops Already Traveled
  - Recalibrate for Maximum Allowed TTL

- **ToS (Type of Service) Cleared:**
  - Set ToS field to 0

- **ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) Cleared:**
  - Set ECN field to 0

##### IPv6
- **Hop Limit Standardization:**
  - Exclude ICMP Echo Requests and Routing Protocols (RIP, BGP)
  - Others: Account for Hops Already Traveled
  - Recalibrate for Maximum Allowed Hop Limit

- **Traffic Class Cleared:**
  - Set Traffic Class field to 0

##### TCP
- **Discard Aberrant Flag Combinations:**
  - Enforce Strict RFC Compliance for all TCP flag combinations
  - Examples:
    - Null (no flags set)
    - Christmas Tree (all flags set)
    - SYN, FIN, ACK (invalid combination)

- **TCP Option Standardization:**
  - Parameters: MSS (Maximum Segment Size), Window, SACK (Selective Acknowledgment), and MD5 Only
  - Values: Original values retained
  - Order: MSS, Window, SACK, and MD5 (if present)
  - Padding: Use NOP (No Operation) until the end of the original length

- **URG (Urgent) Flag and URG Pointer Cleared:**
  - Set URG Flag and URG Pointer to 0
