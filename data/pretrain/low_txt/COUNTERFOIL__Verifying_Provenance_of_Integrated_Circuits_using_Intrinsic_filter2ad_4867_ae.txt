### Cryptographically Signed Enrollment Records

We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on a large population of two different chip types, utilizing various models of low-cost microscope cameras. We have also evaluated the resilience of the fingerprints generated by our method. Importantly, we have shown that even an adversary in possession of an exact duplicate of the mold used to produce a chip's package will not be able to easily create a high-quality counterfeit of the chip.

### Acknowledgments
