# Twitch's Global Content Delivery Infrastructure: An Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This study examines the content delivery infrastructure of Twitch, a leading platform for user-generated live video streaming. We analyze how Twitch adapts to global demand by progressively replicating streams across multiple servers and continents. Our findings highlight the importance of peering and interconnection strategies in delivering live content, particularly in regions with poor local interconnectivity.

## 2. Data and Methodology
We collected data from a full channel crawl using proxies located in different regions. This allowed us to track server redirections and the distribution of viewers across North America (NA), Europe (EU), and Asia (AS). The analysis includes time-series data on the number of servers and the fraction of servers found in each region.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Server Distribution
**Figure 3** shows the number of servers found for two channels: one from the US (nightblue3) and one from Asia (asiagodtonegg3be0). The number of servers is scaled independently in each region.

- **Figure 3(a)**: Number of servers for the US streamer as a time series.
- **Figure 3(b)**: Number of servers for the Asian streamer as a time series.

**Figure 4** illustrates the fraction of servers found in NA, EU, and AS for the bottom 70% and top 10% of channels. Channels with fewer viewers are predominantly served from NA, while more popular channels are distributed across all three continents.

- **Bottom 70% Channels**: Predominantly served from NA.
  - 67% of channels with 0 viewers are exclusively hosted in the US.
  - This drops to 63% for 1 viewer, 48% for 2 viewers, 40% for 4 viewers, and 24% for 5 viewers.
- **Top 10% Channels**: Distributed across all three continents.
  - 21% of servers in NA, 53% in EU, and 26% in AS.

### 3.2. Regional Patterns
Within each continent, we observed distinct patterns:
- **NA**: Channels are first hosted in San Francisco (SFO) before being scaled out to other locations.
- **EU**: Amsterdam (AMS) is the initial host.
- **AS**: Seoul (SEL) is the primary host.

### 3.3. Client Redirection and Traffic Localization
**Table 1** provides a breakdown of the traffic distribution between different continents. Most requests are handled by the nearest continental cluster:
- **North America**: 99.4% of requests are handled by NA servers.
- **South America**: 96% of requests are handled by NA servers.
- **Europe**: 82% of requests are handled by EU servers.
- **Africa**: 78.2% of requests are handled by EU servers.
- **Asia**: Only 45.6% of requests are handled by AS servers; over one-third are handled by NA servers.

**Figure 5** shows the empirical CDF of the fraction of local servers observed by each proxy. There is a clear contrast among the regions:
- **NA**: 90% of clients are always served by NA servers.
- **EU**: 40% of clients are always served by EU servers.
- **AS**: 50% of clients are never served by AS servers, and only 10% are entirely served by AS servers.

**Figure 6** presents the relationship between channel popularity and the fraction of requests redirected to local clusters. European clients receive more local redirects, while Asian requests often leave the continent.

## 4. Discussion
The poor localization of Asian clients can be attributed to inadequate peering arrangements. Networks that exclusively use Asian servers share private peering facilities with Twitch, such as Equinix in Hong Kong. In contrast, networks without peering agreements are often redirected to NA servers. This highlights the critical role of peering and interconnection in live streaming platforms.

## 5. Related Work
Previous studies have examined content delivery infrastructures for Video on Demand (VOD) and live video streaming. For example, Adhikari et al. [8] used PlanetLab nodes to measure YouTube’s infrastructure, finding that it uses many different cache servers inside edge networks. Torres et al. [19] showed that YouTube CDN typically selects the closest server to the user. However, Twitch differs from these platforms due to its live nature and the need for real-time content delivery.

## 6. Conclusion
Twitch operates a more centralized infrastructure compared to traditional VOD platforms like YouTube. This centralization is driven by the need for low-latency, real-time content delivery. Our findings suggest that effective peering and interconnection strategies are crucial for ensuring optimal performance, especially in regions with poor local interconnectivity.
