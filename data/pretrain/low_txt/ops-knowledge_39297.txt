I currently use Eclipse with PyDev to write Python code and have been using Dropbox to synchronize my workspace. However, this solution is far from ideal. I would like to transition to using GitHub or another source control management (SCM) platform so that I can work on my code from different locations. 

Unfortunately, many of the tutorials I've found are quite complex and seem geared towards projects shared among multiple programmers. Could anyone share their experience or recommend a basic tutorial for setting up and using an SCM platform effectively for individual use?

I personally use Bitbucket in conjunction with Mercurial. My repository is hosted on Bitbucket, and I pull and push changes from within Eclipse using Mercurial. For backup purposes, I have an independent Carbonite process that backs up all hard disk files. While this works well for me, I imagine there could be a more streamlined, free, and programmatic way to handle backups if one has the knowledge to write the appropriate scripts.

I'm glad to hear that the first suggestion was helpful. It's wise to set this up now, as it will make your development process much smoother in the long run.
