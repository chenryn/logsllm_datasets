### 5. Performance Evaluation

The performance of the proposed 5G-AKA' was evaluated based on current implementations. The results, presented in Table 3, show the costs for each endpoint in all execution cases, measured in microseconds. These measurements are the average of 1000 runs using the `chrono` library provided by C++11.

**Table 3: Performance Comparison of 5G-AKA and 5G-AKA'**

| Endpoint | 5G-AKA (µs) | 5G-AKA' (µs) | Additional Cost (%) |
|----------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| UE       | 100          | 100.03        | 0.03%               |
| HN       | 200          | 200.04-200.06 | 0.02%-0.03%         |

The data in Table 3 indicates that 5G-AKA' introduces only a minimal additional time cost compared to 5G-AKA. Specifically, for the User Equipment (UE), the transition from 5G-AKA to 5G-AKA' incurs an extra time cost of just 0.03%. On the Home Network (HN) side, the additional time cost is between 0.02% and 0.03%.

### 6. Formal Verification

In this section, we evaluate the security of 5G-AKA' using the state-of-the-art symbolic verification tool, Tamarin Prover [47]. Tamarin Prover is a powerful and efficient tool for symbolic verification and has been used to analyze complex security protocols [24, 31, 32, 56]. To our knowledge, it is the only tool capable of modeling the necessary properties for 5G-AKA [25, 33].

Our formal verification process consists of two parts:

1. **Authentication and Secrecy Goals**: We prove that 5G-AKA' satisfies the goals of authentication and secrecy using a modified Tamarin Prover script for 5G-AKA by Basin et al. [24].
2. **Privacy Goals**: We develop a new script to verify that 5G-AKA' can protect user privacy even in the presence of active attackers. This script builds on the simplified components from the model by Basin et al. [24] to reduce the search space and is designed to handle two AKA sessions to achieve the privacy goal.

#### 6.1 Modeling Choices for 5G-AKA'

The formal verification requires the modeling of ECIES in the KEM/DEM paradigm and a comprehensive script for privacy goals. The major modeling choices are as follows:

- **Modeling ECIES following the KEM/DEM Paradigm**: In the modeling script, we define a generic asymmetric encryption scheme following the KEM/DEM paradigm rather than using Tamarin's built-in theory for Diffie-Hellman groups. This allows our analysis to be applicable to a wide range of 5G-AKA' variants constructed with other asymmetric encryption schemes. We define four functions and an equation over these functions: `encap`, `getkey`, `getcipher`, and `decap`. These functions model the key encapsulation and decapsulation algorithms, with `getkey` and `getcipher` handling the output of `encap`. For more details, see Appendix A.2.
  
- **Modeling Privacy Goals**: Tamarin Prover uses a `diff` operator to model and check privacy-type properties. It generates two systems, the Right Hand System (RHS) and the Left Hand System (LHS), and an observational equivalence lemma. The lemma asserts that an attacker cannot distinguish between LHS and RHS, which would indicate a privacy attack vector. To verify the privacy goal, we use RHS to model two successive sessions of UE1 and LHS to model the second session attended by UE2. If an attacker can distinguish between LHS and RHS, they can perform linkability attacks. The details are shown in Figure 8.

- **Modeling MAC Failure**: Our model also covers the case of MAC failure, which is necessary for the proof of privacy. This captures the scenario where a UE decrypts the challenge sent by the HN with a wrong key. See Appendix A.3 for more details.

**Figure 8: Configurations of RHS and LHS**

| Left Hand System (LHS) | Right Hand System (RHS) |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| (k1, SUPI1, SQNUE1)    | (k1, SUPI1, SQNUE1)     |
| UE1                    | UE1                     |
| (k1, SUPI1, SQNUE1+1)  | (k2, SUPI2, SQNUE2)     |
| UE2                    | UE2                     |

#### 6.2 Verification Results

The formal analysis results for the privacy, authentication, and secrecy goals are as follows:

- **Privacy**: We first identified existing linkability attack paths in 5G-AKA using our script. For 5G-AKA', we confirmed that there are no attack paths in both LHS and RHS settings, meaning that 5G-AKA' can protect user privacy against active attackers. This ensures that an active attacker cannot perform linkability attacks or leak user identifiers by linking 5G-AKA' sessions with 4G-AKA sessions.

- **Authentication and Secrecy**: We applied lemmas from Basin et al. [24] to prove the goals of secrecy and authentication. The formal verification confirms that 5G-AKA' achieves the goals of weak agreement, non-injective agreement, and injective agreement on Kseaf. Confidentiality lemmas hold for all roles, and the UE and HN obtain non-injective agreements on IDSN and SUPI, respectively. The achieved properties are summarized in Table 4.

**Table 4: Authentication and Secrecy Goals Achieved by 5G-AKA'**

| Property                 | UE-SN | SN-HN | HN-UE | UE-HN | SN-UE | HN-SN |
|--------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Weak Agreement           | I     | I     | I     | I     | wa    | wa    |
| Agreement on Kseaf       | I     | -     | -     | -     | -     | -     |
| Agreement on IDSN        | NI    | I     | -     | -     | -     | -     |
| Agreement on SUPI        | -     | -     | -     | -     | -     | NI    |
| Secrecy on Kseaf         | I     | -     | -     | -     | -     | -     |

- **I**: Injective agreement
- **NI**: Non-injective agreement
- **wa**: Implied by weak agreement
- **-**: Violated by definition and not desired by TS 33.501 [20]

### 7. Conclusion

In this paper, we present 5G-AKA' as a privacy-preserving proposal for the AKA protocol of 5G. It provides stronger privacy guarantees than 5G-AKA [20] by protecting users' privacy even in the presence of active attackers. Our approach is compatible with 3GPP specifications for 5G networks and legacy SIM cards, making it suitable for standardization and deployment. The migration from 5G-AKA to 5G-AKA' involves limited additional time costs and may only require software modifications on both endpoints (UE and HN). The compatibility with legacy SIM cards enables reuse of 3G and 4G SIM cards, aligning with mobile communication providers' interests. The standardization of 5G-AKA' may include minimal modifications to TS 33.501, ensuring that already deployed SNs do not need changes.
