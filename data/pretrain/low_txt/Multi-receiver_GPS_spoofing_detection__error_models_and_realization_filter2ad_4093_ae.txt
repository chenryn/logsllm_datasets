### 10. Conclusion

In this work, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of a multi-receiver-based GPS spoofing detection technique and implemented it for the first time in practice. We began by revisiting the underlying assumptions of previous theoretical studies, particularly the error models, and proposed that there is a correlation between errors at co-located receiver positions. Our experimental validation confirmed the presence of the predicted error correlation in both authentic signal scenarios and under spoofing attacks. By leveraging the correlated noise from co-located receivers, we were able to reduce the false acceptance rate of the countermeasure while maintaining its sensitivity to attacks.

Our results indicate that a formation covering an area of 26 m² is sufficient to achieve a detection rate of 99% with a false detection rate of approximately 10⁻⁵, which is a significant improvement over the previously proposed areas of 200 m² [27] or even larger [5]. We developed the first multi-receiver-based GPS spoofing detection system using low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. Through a series of experiments involving both single-antenna and multi-antenna attackers, we validated our theoretical findings. Over a period of approximately 3 hours, we observed no false positives or false negatives.

For future work, promising avenues based on our experimental measurements include further reductions in the required distance between receivers, especially in scenarios with stable signals due to direct line-of-sight or due to receiver dynamics. Additionally, the detection threshold could be dynamically adapted to improve performance.

### Appendix

#### A. Selection of Function \( f \)

We considered four different functions representing minimal, maximal, majority, and normalized approaches. The minimal and maximal functions only consider the minimal and maximal measured distances, respectively. The majority approach uses a voting mechanism, deciding for spoofing when the majority of distances (four out of six) fall below the decision threshold. The normalized approach assigns more significance to certain distances, such as the diagonal in a square being \(\sqrt{2}\) times longer than the edges, and then performs a majority voting.

For \( m = 4 \) receivers, there are six distances in total. We evaluated the detection performance of different instantiations of the function \( f \), which operate on these distances. Exemplary results are presented for the error model with the same error distributions for spoofing and non-spoofing conditions (Case 3). We identified the best choice for the function \( f \) for this specific model and provided insights into the impact of changing error models.

**Figure 13: EER for Different Radii Considering Different Functions \( f \) (Case 3)**

| Function \( f \) | Relation 1 | Relation 2 | Relation 3 |
|------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Minimal          | 1.0000     | 1.2049     | 1.2344     |
| Maximal          | 0.8457     | 1.0000     | 1.0224     |
| Majority         | 0.8320     | 0.9820     | 1.0000     |
| Normalized       | 0.8200     | 0.9800     | 1.0000     |

**Table 6: Function \( f \) Performance (Lower is Better)**

Figure 13 compares the performance values for the chosen types of the function \( f \), i.e., minimal, maximal, majority, and normalized. The minimal function offers the worst performance. The other three types—maximal, majority, and normalized—perform similarly.

To quantitatively compare the performances, we computed the relative difference in EER over all radii and averaged it by normalizing the results. The normalized approach performs approximately 2% better than the (non-normalized) majority voting and approximately 17% better than the maximal function. The majority function has an approximately 15% better average performance than the maximal function. In conclusion, the normalized approach is the best choice for the selected error model.

We also conducted simulations for other error models with similar results. For scenarios with more stable and more correlated signals, the differences between the maximal, majority, and normalized functions decrease, and eventually, the maximal distance performs as well as the others within negligible margins. The usage of the maximal distance can be beneficial for setups with restricted computational resources since this function requires fewer comparisons. Nevertheless, the (normalized) majority voting approach is the optimal choice for all considered error models.

#### B. Further Measurements

We conducted additional measurements between August 2015 and May 2016 to confirm our error modeling approach in different environments. For instance, receivers were placed close to metallic walls or near other noise sources. Over different time periods (up to three days non-stop), measurements were collected to assess the effects of signal reflections and changing meteorological conditions. For clarity, we present resulting parameters for the standard deviation and the correlation here.

**Authentic:**
- For receivers with clear line-of-sight but under multipath effects, typical position noise ranged from \(\sigma \approx 0.746\) to \(\sigma \approx 3.063\), with the latter measured close to a reflecting metallic wall.
- Similar degradations were observed for the correlation between position changes, with additional noise sources decreasing the correlation to \(\rho \approx 0.265\) for direct wall reflections. However, correlations of \(\rho \approx 0.820\) were still measured for receivers affected by multipath signal components but with clear line-of-sight.

**Spoofed:**
- For our spoofing experiments, we varied the antenna inclination due to the different angle-of-arrival of spoofing signals from a ground-level satellite simulator.
- We tried to establish similar power levels at the receiver to imitate normal operation conditions. In all our experiments, the spoofer was in close vicinity to the receivers.
- Typical results for the standard deviation and correlation under unfavorable environments showed that the individual receiver's position inaccuracy increased to \(\sigma \approx 0.882\) under spoofing. The correlation coefficients across several measurements maintained a high level of \(\rho \approx 0.981\) to \(\rho \approx 0.463\) in the worst-case scenario.

**3-Day Experiment:**
- This experiment was run over the course of three days with \( m = 4 \) receivers and changing weather conditions.
- Over 1,000,000 data points for each receiver were recorded. Figure 14 shows a histogram of all relative distances.
- The real distances between the receivers were relatively small to shelter the devices from rain. Outliers are visible and could be caused by changing temperature and weather conditions.
