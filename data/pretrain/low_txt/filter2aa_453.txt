### Predatory Publishing
“Predatory conferences or predatory meetings are events set up to appear like legitimate scientific conferences but which are exploitative. They do not provide proper editorial control over presentations and often falsely claim involvement of prominent academics.” — *Source: Wikipedia*

“Predatory publishers harm scientists, science, and the communication of science. They deceive scientists by pretending to operate as legitimate publishers, when in fact they are counterfeit and only seek quick profits.” — *Jeffrey Beal*

### Fake Cancer Cures
- **Miracle Cancer Cures**
  - **Bees and Propolis**: While bees are fascinating, there is no substantial evidence that propolis can cure cancer.
  - **Reviewer Comments**:
    - "The study provided important experimental and pre-clinical evidence demonstrating the potential application of Bio99TM propolis in cancer treatment."
    - "Authors may want to clarify what 'SiTF' means in Fig. 1."
    - "Hopefully, your research study had Ethics Board review and approval? Better state so. You were intervening with human subjects."

- **GCMAF (Gc Protein-Derived Macrophage Activating Factor)**
  - **Source**: First Immune
  - **Video**: GcMAF – Advertisement with studies
  - **Dr. Hope's Critique**:
    - "These studies are flawed. I don't think it's transparent at all for a layman."
    - Issues include isolated cases, inappropriate testing methods, and positive assessments that should not have been published.

- **Legal Case**:
  - **British Manufacturer, First Immune**: Set to go on trial in London in November for allegedly selling GcMAF as a cancer drug based on false studies.
  - **Health Claims**:
    - Autism
    - Chronic fatigue syndrome
    - Various cancer types
    - Depression

- **Title**: Introducing a Polymorphic Machine Learning Defense for Cyber Attacks Against Gibson Mainframe Computers
- **Authors**: Dade Murphy, Kate Libby
- **Abstract**: Gibson-based mainframe computers remain vulnerable to a specific class of buffer overflow first identified in 1988. We combine next-generation dynamic malware analysis techniques with polymorphic machine learning ZeroR classifiers to detect such attacks with 97.435% accuracy.
