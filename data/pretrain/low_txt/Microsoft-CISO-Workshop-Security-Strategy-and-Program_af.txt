### 1C – Access Control, Security Operations, Asset Protection, Security Governance, and Innovation Security

#### Module 2 – Secure Identities and Access
- **Transformational Forces & End-to-End Architecture:**
  - **Secure Access Service Edge (SASE):** Implementing SASE with Zero Trust principles.
  - **Teams & Tiers Capabilities Threat Intelligence:** Enhancing security through threat intelligence and tiered team capabilities.

- **Mission:**
  - Reduce organizational risk by limiting the time successful attackers can access enterprise assets (dwell time) through rapid detection and response.

- **Key Measurements:**
  - **Effectiveness - Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR):** Measuring the average time to resolve security incidents.
  - **Responsiveness - Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA):** Measuring the average time to acknowledge security incidents.

- **Partner Teams:**
  - IT Operations, DevOps, Insider Threat, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Analysts, Hunters, Incident Response/Recovery Assistance, Threat Intelligence (TI), Automation (SOAR), Extended Detection and Response (XDR).

- **Business Leadership Touchpoints:**
  - Mission Alignment, Continuous Learning, Teamwork.

- **Business Priorities:**
  - Major Incident Status, CISO Workshop, CEO Practice Exercises/Tabletops.

### Asset Protection
- **Effectiveness:**
  - Requires prioritization and consistency/automation for scale.
  - **Discovering Business-Critical Assets:**
    - **Focus on Business-Critical Assets:**
      - Business assets have intrinsic value.
      - Top-Down Discovery: Identifying business-critical assets starts with understanding business priorities, assets, and risks.
    - **Plan for Scale and Speed:**
      - Technical assets host and run business-critical assets (e.g., Retail Website).
      - Enablement of online customer purchases.
      - Technical components: Servers, Databases, Containers, Administrative workstations & identities, Network connections, customer accounts, etc.

- **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:**
  - Technical Estate (Dev → Test → Production).
  - Existing/Legacy Workloads, DevOps Workloads, Workload Infrastructure, Shared Infrastructure, Hybrid and Multi-cloud.

- **Get Secure and Stay Secure:**
  - **Get Secure:**
    - Apply security standards.
    - Protect data at rest and in transit.
    - Asset-specific configurations and protections.
  - **Stay Secure:**
    - Ongoing asset maintenance.
    - Keep software/firmware/etc. patched and up to date.
    - Standards: Architecture, Policy, and Guidance for each asset type.
  - **Continuously Improve:**
    - Standards, Discovery Mechanisms, Application, and automation of standards.
    - Integrate security into new and existing automation.

### Security Governance
- **Business Goals + Risk:**
  - Align technology with business goals.
  - Architecture, Policy, and Standards.
  - Continuous Discovery of Assets and Asset Types.
  - Continuous Improvement of asset security posture.
  - Policy-Driven Governance: Consistent execution.
  - Compliance and Reporting: Ongoing accurate accountability.

- **Key Functions and Relationships:**
  - **Align with Organizational Priorities & Risks:**
    - Set Goals, Principles, and Policies.
    - Business Context & Intelligence.
    - Decision Rights, Processes, Org Chart definition.
  - **Risk and Compliance:**
    - Strategic Threat Intelligence (TI).
    - Patching + Remediation.
    - Monitoring + Enablement.
  - **Access Control:**
    - Establish Zero Trust access model using identity and network controls.
  - **Security Operations:**
    - Detect, Respond, and Recover from attacks.
    - Hunt for hidden threats.
    - Share threat intelligence broadly.
  - **Asset Protection:**
    - Protect sensitive data and systems.
    - Continuously discover, classify, and secure assets.
  - **Innovation Security:**
    - Integrate Security into DevSecOps processes.
    - Align security, development, and operations practices.

### Innovation Security
- **Responsive to Needs:**
  - Meet business and customer requirements for market relevance.
  - Safe and Secure: Provide confidentiality, integrity, availability, and regulatory compliance.
  - Quality and Performance: Meet quality, speed, scalability, reliability, and other expectations.

- **Evolution of Innovation Security:**
  - **DevOps Processes:**
    - Agile rapid delivery enables continuous mitigation of security risks and refinement of security processes.
  - **Innovation Security:**
    - Focused on rapid and secure development with low friction.
    - Integrated into the development process: Automate using CI/CD processes, report bugs through normal processes, etc.
    - Mitigate Risk by enabling teams: Proactively work with developers and DevOps teams to educate, evangelize, and assist with remediation.

- **Traditional Application Security:**
  - Focused on generating reports with scanning tools.
  - **Infra + Dev Risk Security Integration (DevSecOps):**
    - Feedback Loop: Idea Incubation, DevOperations, Architecture & Governance, Security, Compliance, Identity, and Other Standards.
  - **Continuously Improve Process and Program:**
    - Improve developer productivity, operational efficiency, security posture, identity standardization, etc.

- **CISO Workshop:**
  - Review – Innovation Security.
  - Successful innovation requires integrating Development, Security, and Ops (Operations).
  - Traditional Application Security Evolves: Focus on high-quality findings, enablement, and seamless integration into the development process.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Discuss Focus Areas.
  - Assign Next Steps.
  - Security Architecture, Posture Management, Security Maintenance, Asset Protection, Innovation Security, and more.
