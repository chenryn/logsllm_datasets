**Abstract:**
Technology is increasingly being used as a vector for interpersonal attacks, such as stalking, abuse, and other forms of harassment. While previous studies have focused on the ecosystem of software designed for stalking, there is a broader, unstudied landscape of applications—referred to as "creepware"—used for these attacks. In this paper, we initiate a study of creepware using a dataset detailing the mobile apps installed on over 50 million Android devices. We develop a new algorithm, CreepRank, which uses the principle of guilt by association to identify previously unknown examples of creepware. These are then characterized through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Our findings reveal a wide range of apps used for harassment, impersonation, fraud, information theft, concealment, and even apps that claim to defend against such threats. As a result of our work, the Google Play Store has removed hundreds of apps for policy violations. More broadly, our findings and techniques improve the understanding of the creepware ecosystem and will inform future efforts to mitigate interpersonal attacks.

## I. Introduction

Technology is increasingly being used as a vector for interpersonal attacks. One prominent example is in intimate partner violence (IPV), where abusers use various apps to harm their victims, including text message "bombing," spoofing phone numbers, creating fake suggestive images, and installing spyware. Previous research has primarily focused on surveillance apps, but there has been no exploration of the broader landscape of software enabling other forms of harassment.

This paper presents the first measurement study aimed at illuminating the broader ecosystem of what we call "creepware": apps whose primary use case is enabling non-expert users to mount interpersonal attacks. We exclude apps that are only sometimes used for harassment, such as email or messaging apps. Our findings also include apps that purport to defend against interpersonal attacks, providing a more holistic understanding of this problem space.

Unfortunately, prior techniques used to study spyware are not applicable here, as they rely on known search terms. Instead, we turn to the principle of guilt by association, which has been used to discover new strains of conventional malware. This principle suggests that software disproportionately appearing on the same device as known malicious apps is likely to be malicious itself. Adapting this approach to the creepware context requires large amounts of data about app installations and new algorithms.

We partnered with Norton, a major computer security firm, to obtain anonymized data about billions of app installations on 50 million Android devices over several years. We developed a new algorithm, CreepRank, which, given a set of seed apps known to be creepware, assigns scores to other apps. CreepRank is a graph mining algorithm that computes scores using maximum a posteriori estimation, helping to suppress false positives among rare apps.

We applied CreepRank to the Norton dataset using as a seed set the overt spyware surveillance apps identified by Chatterjee et al. [5]. The resulting ranking helped us discover a wide variety of potential creepware apps. To make sense of these results, we manually coded the 1,000 apps with the highest CreepRank, developing a new taxonomy of interpersonal attack and defense apps.

Our manual coding analysis showed that 857 of the top 1,000 apps qualify as creepware, fulfilling a clear purpose related to interpersonal attack or defense. Unsurprisingly, given the seed set, surveillance apps were well-represented, with 372 of the top 1,000 apps, many of which were not identified by prior work. Overall, CreepRank identified more than a million installs of diverse creepware apps, including apps that enable spoofing, harassment, hacking tutorials, and more.

## II. Background and Related Work

### Apps Used for Interpersonal Attacks

Our paper contributes to a growing body of work that seeks to understand the role of technology in interpersonal attacks, such as those in IPV, technology-facilitated bullying, and other forms of targeted harassment. Our work builds on research by Chatterjee et al. [5], which first highlighted the types of apps being used as spyware in IPV.

### Guilt by Association (GBA)

The principle of guilt by association (GBA) infers that apps disproportionately co-installed with known malicious apps are likely to be malicious themselves. GBA has two main benefits for identifying and measuring creepware: it naturally spreads from one class of abusive app to another, and it identifies apps that are actually installed by abusers and/or victims in practice.

## III. Dataset Description and Properties

We developed new data-driven approaches for discovering apps used in interpersonal attack and defense, leveraging datasets consisting of anonymized Android app installations recorded by NortonLifeLock's Norton Mobile Security app. For each device, we have a list of tuples reflecting the apps installed, along with their package names and installation times. We use two datasets: one from 2017 and another from 2018/2019. The 2017 dataset includes 27.7 million devices with 10.9 million unique package names, while the 2018/2019 dataset includes 22.6 million devices with 7.5 million unique package names.

To make the dataset more manageable, we excluded the top 1.1% most prevalent apps and devices with only one app installation. This reduced the number of app installations in the 2017 dataset from 4 billion to 546 million, and in the 2018/2019 dataset from 1.9 billion to 205 million.

## IV. Using Guilt by Association for App Discovery

We are interested in apps useful for interpersonal attack and defense, including those used to monitor, harass, or otherwise harm another person (attack), those used to prevent such attacks (defense), and those useful for both. Our hypothesis is based on the principle of guilt by association, which infers that apps disproportionately co-installed with known malicious apps are likely to be malicious themselves.

For an initial assessment of the viability of the GBA hypothesis, we searched for apps using keywords like "spy" or "track" in their title or package name on devices infected by known covert surveillance apps. This gave us hope that GBA would be useful more broadly.

## V. Contributions

- **CreepRank Algorithm:** We introduce CreepRank, an algorithm that leverages the principle of guilt by association to discover creepware. It identifies 2.8x more creepware among its top 1,000 apps than random walk with restart, another well-known graph-based algorithm.
- **Manual Coding and Taxonomy:** Using manual coding of 1,000 CreepRank-identified apps, we discovered new classes of creepware and developed a creepware taxonomy.
- **Trends and Analysis:** We explore the use of CreepRank with distinct seed sets, study trends in creepware over time, and analyze types of creepware commonly found together on devices.

In summary, our contributions provide valuable insights into the creepware ecosystem and offer practical tools for mitigating interpersonal attacks.
