### Background/Disclaimer
- **Data Types**: This discussion focuses on classified data.
- **National Industrial Security Program (NISP)**: Established by Executive Order 12829.
- **National Industrial Security Program Policy Advisory Committee (NISPPAC)**
- **National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM)**: DoD 5220.22-M, "National Industrial Security Program: Operating Manual."

### DoD Agency Responsible for Interpretation and Enforcement
- **Defense Security Service (DSS)**
  - **Agency Structure**: Includes Directorates (IS, CI, DISCO, and CDSE), ODAA, and Field Offices.

### Basics of Certification and Accreditation (C&A)
- **Definition**: C&A is a process to ensure that information systems meet security requirements.
  - **Certification**: Ensures that the system meets specified security requirements.
  - **Accreditation**: Formal authorization to operate the system.
  - **Roles**:
    - **ISSP (Information System Security Plan) Role**: Defines security controls.
    - **RDAA (Responsible Designated Approving Authority) Role**: Provides final approval.

### Security Controls
- **Origination**: Security controls are developed based on various standards and guidelines.
- **Linux Controls**:
  - **Audit Areas**:
    - `/bin`
    - `/usr/bin`
    - `/etc`
    - `/sbin`
    - `/usr/sbin`
    - `/var/audit`
    - `/usr/local`
    - `/opt`
    - `/home`

- **Comparison: DISA STIG vs. NISPOM/DSS ISL**
  - **DISA STIG**:
    - Audit data files must have permissions of 640 or more restrictive.
    - Logon and logout attempts, process and session initiation, and discretionary access control permission modifications must be audited.
  - **NISPOM/DSS ISL**:
    - Audit trail protection is required.
    - Successful and unsuccessful logons and logoffs must be recorded.
    - Access to security-relevant objects and directories must be logged.
    - Changes in user authenticators must be documented.

### ISL 2009-01 and Windows Baseline Standards
- **ISL 2009-01**: Standardization of Baseline Technical Security Configurations.
- **FISMA (NIST 800-53)**: June 2011.
- **Linux**: Not explicitly covered, assumed to be inherently secure.

### ISFO Manual Updates (Summary of Changes)
- **Password Requirements**: 14-character passwords with 60-day change intervals.
- **Patching**: ISSM identifies and installs security-relevant software upgrades.
- **USB Drives**: Expanded audit requirements.
- **Security Seals**: Use of approved tamper-proof, pre-numbered seals on hardware components.

### Document Drafting and Approval
- **ISFO Process Manual and Standardization Documents**: Drafting and approval processes.
- **Linux Document Development**: Challenges and eventual discontinuation.

### Security Setting Testing
- **Inadequate Labs**: Limited test resources and facilities.

### Enforcement
- **Special Agents**: Conduct inspections and enforce compliance.
- **Industrial Security Specialist (0080) and IT Specialist (2210)**: Trained and authorized to enforce security measures.
- **Inspection Selection and Process**: Based on facility size and complexity.
- **Partnership with Industry**: Collaboration to ensure compliance.
- **Non-Compliance Consequences**: Actions taken if non-compliance is identified.

### Inadequate Controls - Windows
- **Patching**: Inconsistent application.
- **USB**: Limited control.
- **Virtual Environments**: Insufficient security.
- **UAC (User Account Control)**: Not always effective.
- **Admin Actions and Classified Data**: Not adequately audited.
- **Tamper Controls**: Inadequate.

### Inadequate Controls - *nix
- **Lack of Expertise**: Limited training and experience.
- **Job Listings**: No requirement for Unix/Linux experience.
- **Configuration Guides**: Not consistently used.
- **Auditing Rules**: Not required in Red Hat.

### Wrap-up
- **Purpose**: To educate and enlighten about the U.S. methods for protecting classified data.
- **Importance**: Highlighting issues detrimental to national security.
- **Examples**: STUXNET and Flame.
