### Appendix E

In this section, we describe the addition of noise multiple times rather than per group. While the server communication in our approach is more efficient (requiring only kilobytes), our client communication is similar (also in kilobytes). However, their computation time is linear in the number of parties. In contrast, PEM's computation time is linear in the domain bit-length and asymptotically faster than Boneh et al. [20]. Adjusted for \( k = 256 \) and \( b = 256 \), PEM outperforms their approach for more than 6 million clients.

Naor et al. [65] consider the differential privacy (DP) collection of frequently used passwords with malicious parties. At a high level, their hash-then-match approach is similar to PEMorig, requiring \( n^2 l \) server operations, albeit more efficiently (without hashing). Each user \( j \) receives a random \( l \)-bit value \( r_j \) from the server, computes an \( l \)-bit hash \( h_j \) of their password, and reports one bit, which is the inner product of \( r_j \) and GRR(\( h_j \)) over \( GF[2] \). The server maintains \( 2l \) counters, tries to find a matching \( x \in 2l \) for every report, and increments the corresponding counters. Hash values are released if their noisy counts exceed a fixed fraction of the user count. This protocol is almost an LDP protocol, with the same accuracy limitations, where secure computation is required as malicious users cannot learn \( r_j \). Their protocol involves a series of two-party computations between users and the server, whereas our protocol is a multi-party computation, allowing users to outsource the computation and only need to secret share their inputs.

### Conclusion

We have presented protocols for federated, differentially private top-\( k \) discovery using secure multi-party computation (MPC). Our central DP approaches, HH and PEM, provide higher accuracy than local DP methods for a small number of users without relying on a trusted third party, thanks to our use of cryptography. HH, based on non-private heavy hitter discovery in data streams [27], has a running time linear in the data size but supports unknown domains and provides better accuracy than PEM for very small data sizes, where local DP methods cannot achieve meaningful accuracy. PEM, based on Wang et al. [78], iteratively finds and extends frequent prefixes, is linear in the bit-length of the data domain, and provides better accuracy than HH for larger data sizes. We implemented our protocols using two MPC frameworks [4, 53], compared them, and achieved practical running times of less than 11 minutes in a real-world wide area network (WAN). Future work in MPC sketching might reduce reconstruction overhead by combining multiple sketches, though at the cost of increased communication. Additionally, leveraging public data like Li et al. [58] and considering adaptive composition [31] instead of parallel composition could be explored.

### Notes

Boneh et al. [20, Table 9] process approximately 120 clients/second (on 32 vCPUs, 60 GB RAM, and a WAN delay of about 62 ms, with \( b = 256 \) and \( k \) as 0.1% of the number of clients). PEM runs in less than 12 minutes in total (on 4 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM with a 100 ms delay, \( b = 64 \), and \( k = 16 \)), and its performance is independent of the client count \( n \) but linear in \( k \) and \( b \). When adjusting PEM's time for \( k = 256 \) and \( b = 256 \), and multiplying by 120 clients/s, it results in approximately 5.6 million clients.
