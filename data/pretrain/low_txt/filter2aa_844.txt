### What Happened to IPv5?

- **Internet Stream Protocol (ST, ST2, ST+)**:
  - Developed in the late 1970s (Internet Engineering Note 119, 1979).
  - Designed for real-time applications like voice.
  - Guaranteed bandwidth and QoS.
  - Set the version field in the IP header to 5.
  - Interest from IBM, Sun, and others continued into the 1990s.

### Potential Replacements for IPv4

- **RFC 1752**: Recommendation for the IP Next Generation Protocol (IPv6).
- **RFC 1475**: TP/IX: The Next Internet (IPv7).
- **RFC 1621**: PIP - The P Internet Protocol (IPv8).
- **RFC 1374**: TUBA - TCP and UDP with Bigger Addresses (IPv9).
- **RFC 1606**: A Historical Perspective on the Usage of IP Version 9.

  - Transit via OCCAID.
  - Cisco router.
  - OpenBSD firewall.
  - WWW, DNS, FTP, SMTP services.
  - Transitioned to dual stack.

- **2008: NTT / TiNet IPv6**
  - 1000 Mbit/s to NTT / TiNet.
  - Cisco ASR 1000 Router.
  - Foundry Load Balancers (IPv6 support was in beta).
  - DNS, Whois, IRR, and more.
  - Dual stack.
  - Standalone network.

### Meeting Networks

- **IPv6 Enabled Since 2005**:
  - Tunnels to ARIN and others.
  - Testbed for transition technologies.
  - NAT-PT (Cisco, OSS).
  - CGN / NAT-lite.
  - Training opportunities for staff and members.

### IPv6 Traffic Volume

- **Whois**: 0.12%

### Security Considerations

- **Similarities and Differences**:
  - Many things are the same but different.
  - Built-in (in)security features.
  - Multiple protocols mean multiple policies.

- **IPv4 vs. IPv6**:
  - IPv4 features do not match IPv6 features.
  - IPv6 uses ICMPv6 instead of ARP.
  - ICMPv6 is critical for IPv6 functionality.
  - DHCPv6 and router advertisements.

- **Hardware and Software Support**:
  - Inconsistent application and OS behavior.
  - Weak IPv6 support in firewalls, IDS, switches, and load balancers.

- **Security Through Obscurity**:
  - IPv6 has been in many OSes for over 10 years.
  - Stacks are not battle-tested.
  - Applications are not well tested.
  - Stack smashing and buffer overflows are potential issues.
  - Many unknowns in IPv6 implementations.

- **Built-in Security Features**:
  - IPsec ESP and AH are built-in.
  - Easy VPNs.
  - Enhanced routing security.
  - Application layer security.

- **Potential Security Risks**:
  - ESP can make deep packet inspection difficult.
  - AH is hard to configure and maintain.
  - IPv6-enabled backdoors and trojans.
  - No NAT? How to hide networks?
  - Complex and confusing IPv6 address types.

- **Cross Contamination**:
  - Multiple stacks, multiple targets.
  - Maintaining policy parity is difficult.
  - Applications lack feature parity.
  - Appliances lack feature parity.

### Lessons Learned: Implementation

- **Tunnels vs. Native**:
  - Tunnels are less desirable than native.
  - Not all transit is equal.
  - Routing is not as reliable.
  - Dual stack is not so bad.
  - Proxies are good for transition.
  - Native support is better.
  - DHCPv6 is not well supported.
  - Reverse DNS is a pain.
  - Windows XP is broken but usable.
  - Bugging vendors does work!

- **Dual Stack**:
  - Makes policy more complex.
  - IPv6 security features are a double-edged sword.
  - Security vendors are behind on IPv6.
  - IPv6 stacks are relatively untested.
  - A new world for hackers to explore.

### Lessons Learned: Security

- **ICMPv6**:
  - Understanding ICMPv6 is essential.
  - Fragmentation is very different in IPv6.
  - Multicast is an attack and discovery vector.
  - Read RFC 4942!
