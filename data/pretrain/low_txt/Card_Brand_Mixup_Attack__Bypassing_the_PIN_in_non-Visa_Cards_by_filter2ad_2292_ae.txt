### Various Relay and NFC Attacks

Various relay and other NFC (Near Field Communication) attacks have been presented at hacking conferences, as documented in [21, 24, 29, 31]. Notably, [29] describes a relay attack implementation using two Software Defined Radio (SDR) boards. According to the authors, this setup provides a faster and more controlled relay channel compared to those implemented using mobile phones over WiFi. However, our tests with an Android app have shown that the transmission speed of WiFi-based relay channels is not a significant issue.

### PIN Bypass for Visa Contactless Cards

Galloway and Yunusov [21] were the first to demonstrate a method for bypassing PIN verification on modern Visa contactless cards. Their man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, implemented using wired Raspberry Pi boards, modifies both the Terminal Transaction Qualifiers (TTQ) before delivering them to the card and the Card Transaction Qualifiers (CTQ) before transmitting them back to the terminal. Although they did not weaponize their attack for inconspicuous use in real-world scenarios, their work highlighted a critical vulnerability.

### Cloning and Magnetic Stripe Data

In 2020, Galloway [20] demonstrated that it is still possible to clone a card and use the clone for swiped transactions. Using an MSR605 magnetic card reader/writer, which costs around $100, the cloning process can be performed effortlessly. The research also revealed that the data required to create counterfeit magstripe cards can be read from EMV interfaces (both NFC and contact chip) using a skimmer device. This data includes Track 1 and Track 2 Equivalent Data objects provided by the card during an EMV session. Drimer et al. [12] had previously demonstrated similar cloning techniques in 2008, indicating that this problem remains unresolved after more than a decade.

### Our Card Brand Mixup Attack

Our current work builds on our previous research [6], introducing a novel card brand mixup attack that exposes a serious weakness in the EMV protocol. This vulnerability allows payments with Mastercard cards to be processed as fraudulent Visa transactions. We have extended our model of the issuer and the terminal-issuer channel to support online transactions where the terminal and issuer do not agree on the card brand. Our extended model has been used to verify new fixes that prevent the card brand mixup. The implementation of our attack involves nearly 1,000 lines of Java code, which modify NFC messages and handle the necessary cryptographic mechanisms, such as retrieving public keys from certificates. In contrast, our PIN bypass attack on Visa does not require these mechanisms.

### Conclusions

We have identified a critical and easily exploitable vulnerability in the EMV contactless protocol: the Application Identifiers (AIDs) are not authenticated to the payment terminal. AIDs define the protocol instance (kernel) to be activated for the transaction. An adversary can exploit this by replacing legitimate AIDs, tricking the terminal into activating a flawed kernel.

Our man-in-the-middle attack demonstrates how to deceive the terminal into transacting with a Mastercard card while believing it to be a Visa card. Combined with our recently developed PIN bypass attack [6] on Visa, this results in a novel, critical attack where criminals can bypass the PIN for Mastercard cards, even for online-authorized transactions where the terminal and card issuer disagree on the card brand.

To validate our findings, we developed a proof-of-concept Android application and successfully tested our attack on a real-world payment terminal. For example, we bypassed the PIN in a transaction for 400 CHF with a Maestro debit card. We have also extended our formal model of EMV to include the terminal-issuer channel, allowing communication even when these agents disagree on the card brand. This extended model was used to formally verify that the fixes proposed in [6] for the Visa kernel are effective against our Mastercard-Visa mixup attack. Additionally, we specified and verified two new intra-kernel countermeasures for the Mastercard kernel. Furthermore, Mastercard has implemented an alternative defense mechanism at the network level, which we have experimentally confirmed as effective against our attack.
