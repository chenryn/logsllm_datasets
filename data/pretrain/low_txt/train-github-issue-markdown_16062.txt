## Issue Description
I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

### Expected Behavior
There is a search page with infinite scroll (lazy loading). When I click on an item in the search results, I am redirected to the search detail page. This works as expected. However, when I navigate back to the search page, I expect it to render first and then set the previous scroll position where the selected item was visible.

### Current Behavior
Currently, the last scroll position of the search page is retained, but it is applied before the page has fully rendered. This causes the search page to flicker, which is more noticeable on mobile devices compared to web browsers.

### Environment
- **Next.js Version:** 5.0.1
- **Node.js Version:** 8
- **Operating System:** iOS
- **Browser:** Safari
