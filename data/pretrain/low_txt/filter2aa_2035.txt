Federal Communications Commission  
445 12th Street, SW  
Washington, DC 20554  

**Re:** Notice of Ex Parte Communication, ET Docket Nos. 04-186, 02-380

Dear Ms. Dortch:

On March 13, 2007, on behalf of a coalition that includes Dell, Inc., Google, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp., and Philips Electronics North America Corp., Srihari Narlanka of Microsoft; William Brown and John Clark, outside consultants to Microsoft; and Edmond Thomas and S. Roberts Carter of Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP, submitted a prototype TV band device to the FCC Laboratory for testing. The above-named individuals also met with Rashmi Doshi, Steven Jones, and Steven Martin of the Office of Engineering and Technology to provide instruction on the operation of the device.

On March 14, 2007, Messrs. Thomas, Narlanka, Brown, and Clark met with Messrs. Doshi and Jones, as well as Thomas Phillips of the OET staff, to further discuss the operation of the device. Additionally, the Coalition provided OET staff with a copy of the device manual, which is attached hereto.

Pursuant to the Commission’s rules, a copy of this notice is being filed electronically in the above-referenced dockets. If you require any additional information, please contact the undersigned at (202) 730-1305.

Sincerely yours,

/s/ Edmond J. Thomas

**Microsoft TV White Spaces Development Platform**  
**System Overview**  
**Page 1**

1. **SYSTEM OBJECTIVE AND OVERVIEW**  
The Microsoft TV White Spaces Development Platform is a development platform designed to explore, develop, and evaluate technologies required to create a commercially viable cognitive radio-based communications network product. With the Microsoft Cognitive Radio, developers will be able to:
   - Create spectrum scanning and signal feature recognition software and hardware used to co-exist and avoid interfering with incumbent operators.
   - Develop and refine transmit power control algorithms.
   - Explore and test waveforms and modulation techniques with minimal interference with expected TV band signals.
   - Perform on-air propagation and coverage measurements.

2. **SYSTEM OPERATION**  
The Microsoft TV White Spaces Development Platform assembly consists of two core system assemblies:
   - A Wide-band Spectrum Scanner and Network Processor, and a tunable UHF Half-Duplex Transceiver controlled by the Network Processor.
   - A Windows-based PC using the Internet Explorer browser as the command and control interface.

**2.1 System Operation**  
- A broadband 521 to 698 MHz computer-controlled frequency scanner and high-speed digitizer capable of incrementally scanning UHF TV channels 21 through 51 in 6 MHz segments. The digitized time-domain 6 MHz scan information is passed to the network analyzer where a 2048 FFT is performed.
- Signal feature templates for DTV, NTSC, and wireless microphone devices are sequentially applied to the FFT information to identify occupied DTV or NTSC channels. Non-occupied channels are declared potential white channels and subsequently scanned for potential narrowband incumbents such as wireless microphones.
- Scanner control and discovery information is presented via the Internet Explorer Web Browser.

**2.2 UHF Radio Network Processor Assembly**  
The UHF Tx/Rx Assembly consists of three sub-components:
   - S-Band (2.4 GHz) 802.11g OFDM modem located in the Network Processor.
   - Half-duplex S-Band to UHF block converter.
   - Network Processor Browser for Frequency and Power Control.

UHF radio specifications are presented in Table 1.

**3. INTERNET EXPLORER SCANNER AND TX PANELS**  
The TV white spaces radio assembly is controlled via a Windows® Internet Explorer browser control panel. Specific controls include:
   - The ability to select any operating frequency between 521 to 698 MHz in 1 MHz increments.
   - Tx power output control from -10 dBm to +20 dBm.
   - Ability to search individual UHF TV channel groups for occupied DTV or NTSC channels.
