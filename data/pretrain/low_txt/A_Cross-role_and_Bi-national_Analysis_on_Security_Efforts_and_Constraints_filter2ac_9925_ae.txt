### Main Survey Questions

The following questionnaire was first written in Japanese and then translated into English by authors who are native Japanese speakers with 10 or more years of experience writing research papers in English. The translated questionnaire was proofread by a native English-speaking proofreader and a Japanese-English bilingual to ensure accuracy.

#### Introduction

The purpose of this questionnaire is to analyze security awareness and behavior in software development projects. The contents of the answers will be used to:
- Analyze constraints that prevent the development of secure software.
- Research and develop solutions to such constraints.
- Be published as statistical information in academic publications.
- Be provided only to the organization requesting this survey.
- Be treated as confidential and strictly managed to ensure they are not lost or leaked.

This survey is conducted anonymously, and no personally identifiable information or organization-identifiable information will be collected. All questions are optional. If you do not want to answer a question due to your position or affiliation, please leave it blank or unselected.

**Number of questions:** 26  
**Rewards:** Points equivalent to 10 USD in the currency of your panel.  
**Note:** Points will be given in 4 to 6 weeks.  
**Proceed only if you agree to the above.**

#### Notes
- The term "project" in this study refers to a plan for the development of software to provide a specific service/product, as well as a team/group formed for that purpose.
- This survey includes questions about your company and development project. If you are currently involved with more than one company/project, please answer from the standpoint of the affiliation where you spend the most time working.
