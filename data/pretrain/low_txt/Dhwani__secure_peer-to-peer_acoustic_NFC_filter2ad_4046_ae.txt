# 9. Evaluation of Dhwani

In this section, we present a comprehensive evaluation of Dhwani, quantifying several performance aspects such as its range, the effectiveness of self-interference cancellation (SIC), and the achieved packet success rates for different modulation schemes.

## 9.1 Operating Range of Dhwani

For Dhwani to be suitable for Near Field Communication (NFC), the communication range must be limited to a very small distance. As discussed in Section 3, each transmitter was pre-configured based on measurements to operate within a range of 10 cm.

### Experimental Setup
To evaluate the sharpness of the drop-off in the communication range, we measured the Packet Success Rate (PSR) by transmitting 100 packets between a Samsung Galaxy S2 and an HP mini at various distances. Figure 13 shows the PSR as a function of distance, with and without jamming, for two different modulations: Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) and Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK). The best-case SIC was used in the presence of jamming (see Section 9.2 below).

### Results
As seen from Figure 13, the PSR sharply falls to 0 at a distance of about 20 cm, even in the absence of any jamming. This confirms that the communication range is indeed small, making Dhwani suitable for NFC applications.

## 9.2 Effectiveness of SIC

In this experiment, we evaluate the effectiveness of Dhwani's SIC. As described in Section 6, Dhwani generates Pseudo-Noise (PN) sequences during training and uses the recorded versions of these sequences to perform SIC. If the devices are trained at one "training" location and then moved to another "test" location, the multi-path environment may change, even though the channel characteristics of the speaker and microphone do not.

### Experimental Setup
We tested Dhwani in four different locations: a small room (L1), a large room (L2), an open pantry area (L3), and a cafeteria (L4). At each location, Dhwani was trained by generating a library of PN sequences and then tested by performing SIC at all other locations. Table 1 shows the amount of SIC obtained when the PN sequence generated at location Li was used to cancel at location Lj, averaged over 10 trials.

### Results
- **Matching Locations**: When the training and test locations are the same, the SIC is close to 20 dB, meaning 1% of the jamming signal remains.
- **Non-Matching Locations**: When the training and test locations are different, the SIC degrades to 6-7 dB. This indicates that even though multi-path is not the primary cause of frequency selectivity in the acoustic channel, it significantly impacts SIC. However, per the discussion in Section 3.5, even this reduced SIC is sufficient for secure communication.

## 9.3 Impact of Jamming on Packet Success Rate

To evaluate the impact of jamming, we measured packet success rates for 256-bit packets at various locations with SIC based on the recorded PN sequences from different locations. Figure 14 depicts the PSR when the initial configuration was performed at L1 and Dhwani was tested at locations L1-L3. The PSR is measured by transmitting 100 packets and counting the number of packets whose Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) did not fail.

### Baseline Measurement
First, we established a baseline by measuring the PSR without any jamming. As seen from the figure, in the absence of jamming, the PSR for BPSK modulation is 100%, while it is about 95% for QPSK modulation.

### Results with Jamming
- **Configuration and Testing at L1**: In the presence of jamming and SIC, BPSK still gives a 100% PSR, while it reduces to about 80% for QPSK.
- **Testing at Other Locations**: When Dhwani is tested at other locations, the PSR is around 90% for BPSK and 60-70% for QPSK.
- **No SIC**: In the presence of jamming, zero out of 100 packets were received successfully at each location when no SIC was applied, corresponding to the scenario where the eavesdropper is co-located with the receiver.

## 9.4 Performance of JamSecure with Increasing Mixing Factor

In previous results, we demonstrated the effectiveness of SIC when jamming was done using a single PN sequence (Mixing Factor K = 1). As discussed in Section 6, when receivers are located at fixed installations, an eavesdropper may have the advantage of time to learn the library of PN sequences. The mixing factor K > 1 can thwart the eavesdropper by increasing the search space exponentially.

### Experimental Setup
Figure 15 depicts the SIC achieved by JamSecure for various values of K, when the training and testing locations were the same (L1) and when they were different (trained in L1 and tested in L2, L3).

### Results
- **Same Training and Testing Locations**: As expected, SIC degrades as K increases from 1 to 5, but even at K = 5, the SIC is as high as 10 dB.
- **Different Training and Testing Locations**: The achieved SIC only decreases slightly as K increases from 1 to 5, typically remaining between 6-7 dB. Figure 16 shows the PSR for BPSK modulation, which is almost 100% when the receiver is trained and tested in the same location and over 90% for values of K between 1 and 5.

## 9.5 Multipath Effects on Jamming

To determine if there are special vantage points where jamming is not effective, we conducted experiments using the topology depicted in Figure 18. We placed an eavesdropper E at various locations around the sender A and measured the received Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in the presence of jamming from the receiver B. Figure 17 shows the received SNR at placement locations centered around the sender at three different distances (D = 2, 5, and 10 cm) and angles (θ at 45° intervals).

### Results
At all these locations, while there are variations in SNR, the observed SNR is typically less than 0 dB, indicating that there is no vantage point where an eavesdropper can achieve successful reception.

# 10. Related Work

We have presented background and related work in the context of NFC (Section 2) and SIC (Section 6.1). Here, we discuss prior work on phone-based acoustic communication and physical-layer security.

## 10.1 Acoustic Communication

[17] provides an extensive review of acoustic communication as a wireless technology for short and long-distance communication. Existing techniques use On-Off Keying (OOK) modulation and achieve up to 270 bps at short distances of under 30 cm. Our current implementation of Dhwani uses Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and achieves 5x these data rates.

Wimbeep [1] and Zoosh [2] offer acoustic communication systems targeting location-based advertising and mobile payments. While the technical details of these startup offerings are not available, the description of Zoosh at [8] indicates that it operates in the ultrasonic band (beyond 20 kHz), offers a low bit rate of 300 bps, and limits the communication range to 15 cm to provide security. We believe that security based on range limitation alone is inherently risky since the eavesdropper could use an ultra-sensitive microphone to boost the effective reception range. Hence, Dhwani emphasizes information-theoretic security at the physical layer.

## 10.2 Physical-Layer Security

The related work closest to Dhwani is IMDShield [12], which aims to secure communication to and from implantable medical devices (IMDs). IMDs are not amenable to cryptographic techniques due to limited device memory and the need for immediate access in critical scenarios. IMDShield continuously listens to IMD transmissions and transmits a jamming signal to secure it from eavesdroppers. Similar to Dhwani, the IMD base-station can perform SIC and extract the message transmitted from the IMD. It then relays this message securely to the intended receiver using suitable encryption mechanisms. Dhwani's novelty compared to this work lies in (a) being a software-only solution with no additional hardware, and (b) the JamSecure technique, which uses a pre-computed library-based approach to jamming and SIC (Section 6.2).

In Radio Telepathy [19], the authors propose a scheme where every pair of nodes can agree on a cryptographic key without actually performing a key exchange. The key idea is that since the wireless channel between a pair of nodes is symmetric, a common key can be extracted independently at each node from the channel response characteristics from a single transmission. In [15], the authors explore the practical limitations of extracting viable cryptographic keys using channel response information. In [18], the authors propose attack cancellation, a technique where sensor nodes in a sensor network collaboratively jam fake transmissions to defend against battery depletion attacks.

# 11. Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented Dhwani, a software-only acoustic NFC system that is accessible to the large base of existing mobile devices. The design of Dhwani is informed by our characterization of acoustic hardware and environment and includes several novel elements. Chief among these is the receiver-based, self-jamming technique called JamSecure, which provides information-theoretic, physical-layer security. Our experimental evaluation points to the suitability of Dhwani for secure NFC communication.
