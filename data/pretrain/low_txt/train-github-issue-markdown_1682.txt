### Current Behavior
Currently, I am required to import my components for declarations both in the bootstrap process and in my router configuration.

### Expected/Desired Behavior
I should only need to import my component declarations in the router configuration. The module should automatically handle the inclusion of these declarations.

### Reproduction of the Problem
If this is a bug or if you can better illustrate your feature request with an example, please provide the steps to reproduce the issue. If possible, include a minimal demo via [Plunker](https://plnkr.co) or a similar platform. You may use this template as a starting point: [Angular Plunker Template](http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5).

### Expected Behavior
The module should automatically add the imported component declarations to the declarations array, eliminating the need to manually import them in both the bootstrap and router configurations.

### Motivation / Use Case for Changing the Behavior
This change would reduce unnecessary work and streamline the development process by automating the inclusion of component declarations.

### Environment
