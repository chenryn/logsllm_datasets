### Introduction

Implementing the principle of open public administration in today’s eGovernment initiatives represents a significant challenge to the architects of both administrative procedures and the supporting IT systems. Protecting the privacy of the citizen, while providing rich, coherent services spanning multiple administrative areas, calls for new design principles and technologies.

The term "Privacy Enhancing Technologies" (PETs) encompasses a spectrum of both new and well-known techniques to minimize the exposure of private data for users of electronic services in the information society. However, the term does not have a widely accepted definition, and the scope of PETs often varies depending on the usage scenario.

This study was initiated by the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation to improve the ministry’s background knowledge of PETs and to describe possible use scenarios. An important purpose of this study is to propose a high-level classification of Privacy Enhancing Technologies, along with a corresponding classification of the most significant products on the market and their features. The report aims to help officials evaluate the feasibility of employing PETs in electronic communication between public administration, private enterprises, and consumers. The scope of the analysis is to provide a European view, focused on the situation in Denmark, the UK, Germany, and common EU activities. Global trends will be included where applicable.

To explore this issue in depth, META Group conducted research with European thought leaders to understand how major information security initiatives address the privacy challenge. The research involved a series of in-depth interviews with key persons in Europe during the summer and fall of 2004. The findings provided a wide range of views on how public and private organizations in Europe view the privacy issue and the technologies they use to provide solutions. Participants were from the manufacturing, finance, telecommunications, government, and utility sectors.

### Management Summary

For the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation, META Group has carried out research with European thought leaders to understand how major information security initiatives address the privacy challenge.

Protecting privacy focuses on reducing the information collected and stored to a minimum and deleting it as soon as it has served its purpose. However, these principles are challenged by the individual’s need for convenient electronic services and the need for efficiency in eBusiness or eGovernment transactions. Most of today’s e-services rely on stored data, identifying the customer, their preferences, and previous transaction records. Combining such data can often constitute an invasion of privacy. The purpose of Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) is to protect the privacy of individuals while still enabling them to interact with other parties in a modern society using electronic communications.

META Group’s research revealed a broad consensus regarding the need for privacy and a general recognition that the design of today’s IT systems and networks poses a serious challenge to privacy. The public IT infrastructure should be designed or redesigned to put the user in control of their personal information and private sphere. However, given the extent of the infrastructure and the considerable commercial and state interests in collecting personal data, this will not happen overnight. In the meantime, a number of Privacy Enhancing Technologies can be used to improve privacy protection in selected areas and cases.

The current privacy threats fall into three major classes:
A) Loss of confidentiality
B) Identity theft
C) Unsolicited messages (spam)

Privacy Enhancing Technologies can be used to improve privacy protection and minimize the threats of all three classes. Some privacy tools are actively involved in information storage and transport, while others support the administration of privacy rules. This report proposes two main categories of Privacy Enhancing Technologies: Privacy Protection and Privacy Management. The first category includes tools and technologies that actively protect privacy, such as by hiding private information or eliminating the need for personal identification. The second category, Privacy Management, includes tools and technologies that support the administration of privacy rules rather than processing the information itself.

The purpose of Privacy Enhancing Technologies is to achieve one or more of the three main privacy aspects:
1. Unobservability – making private information invisible or unavailable to others
2. Unlinkability – preventing others from linking different pieces of observed information together
3. Anonymity – preventing others from connecting observed information with a specific person

The report organizes Privacy Enhancing Technologies into subcategories and explains how the technical features of privacy solutions support each of the privacy aspects mentioned above.

Several use cases illustrate common situations from the “old world,” where the protection of privacy has traditionally been an integrated part of the transaction, such as in recruiting agencies. When such transactions are implemented using electronic services, special care must be taken to protect the privacy of individuals, and the use of privacy tools becomes relevant. Other use cases show how the deployment of new technologies, such as Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID), for remote identification of products sold in a supermarket, can form a privacy threat for the consumer. Here, the new technology must have a privacy-aware design to gain wide acceptance.

Most of today’s Privacy Enhancing Technologies are conceptually add-on products designed to compensate for flaws in the original design of IT systems and information handling procedures. Adding PETs to existing legacy applications can impact the efficiency, reliability, and robustness of the service. To make existing systems “privacy-compliant,” design principles must be revised, and central parts of the design must be reworked. The effort required to conduct such a process is considerable, and the timeframe is very large.

The overall maturity of privacy solutions is currently considered low. Standardization of privacy features and solutions is yet to come; the current PET solutions are rarely interoperable (with a few notable exceptions) because a common understanding of the concepts and requirements has not been established. However, some best practices have emerged in the area of privacy policy generation and compliance control.

Many industries already use PETs, especially when multiple parties need to share some data while keeping other data separate. The PETs used in such cases are often embedded in custom-built solutions rather than being added to standard systems. It is expected that tomorrow’s privacy solutions will be an integrated part of public and private administrative solutions, based on an architecture where privacy has been an integral part of the design criteria.

Today’s public administrative systems include limited privacy-protecting functionality, while the law requires administrative staff to follow procedures that protect the citizen’s privacy. Unfortunately, many e-Government service developments follow this trend by not rating privacy principles high in their basic design criteria. Privacy-aware design (of data, applications, and procedures) is key to obtaining privacy, but very few examples of this have been seen.

It is expected that companies delivering Internet shopping and other electronic services will respond to the customer’s need for privacy by offering appropriate functionality, such as:

- Secure data storage
- Anonymized transactions
- User-controlled data sharing
- Robust encryption and authentication mechanisms

These measures will help build trust and ensure that privacy remains a top priority in the digital age.
