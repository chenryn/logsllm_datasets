**Description:**

Recent versions of mobile operating systems have introduced various privacy enhancements, which can impact the visibility and accessibility of installed applications. For example, Android 11 enhanced package visibility by filtering the results returned from the package manager. This change restricts the ability of apps to see a list of all installed applications, thereby enhancing user privacy.

Similarly, iOS 12 removed a private API that was previously used to list installed applications on non-App Store applications. This removal further limits the ability of third-party apps to access information about other installed apps, contributing to a more secure and private user experience.
