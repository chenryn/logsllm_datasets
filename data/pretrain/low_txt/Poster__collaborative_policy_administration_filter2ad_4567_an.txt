### Social Impact and Social Change in Design

The primary focus of socially responsive design, as discussed by Gamman and Thorpe (2011), is on social impact, with the main objective being to drive social change. This perspective is explored in their article, "Design with Society: Why Socially Responsive Design is Good Enough," published in *CoDesign International Journal of CoCreation in Design and the Arts* (Vol. 7, No. 3-4, pp. 217-231). The special issue on Socially Responsive Design further emphasizes the importance of design in addressing societal challenges.

### Fighting Crime Through Effective Design

The Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) (2009) also highlights the potential of design in reducing crime. In their report, "Fighting Crime Through More Effective Design: Can Crime Be Reduced by Making It Harder, More Risky, and Less Rewarding?" they explore how design can be used to create environments that deter criminal activity. The report is available at: [http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News-and-Events/Publications/Publications-archive/Documents/General/Fighting-crime-through-effective-design.pdf](http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News-and-Events/Publications/Publications-archive/Documents/General/Fighting-crime-through-effective-design.pdf).

### Bike Off 2: Catalyzing Anti-Theft Bike, Bike Parking, and Information Design

Thorpe and Gamman, along with Ekblom, Willcocks, Sidebottom, and Johnson (2010), discuss the "Bike Off 2" project, which focuses on catalyzing anti-theft bike, bike parking, and information design for the 21st century. This open research approach is detailed in the chapter "Catalyzing Anti Theft Bike, Bike Parking And Information Design For The 21st Century: An Open Research Approach" in *Designing for the 21st Century: Volume 2: Interdisciplinary Methods and Findings*, edited by Inns, T. (Farnham: Gower, pp. 238-258).

### Camden Green Zones Project

In collaboration with the London Borough of Camden, we aimed to catalyze the uptake of up to seventy-five different actions related to reduced carbon emissions across thirty neighborhoods. We recognized that these goals aligned with our DESIS project, which seeks to change behaviors through collaborative actions rather than individual efforts. These strategies can be viewed as 'Public and Collaborative' services.

Despite government cuts and austerity measures, Camden Council provided in-kind support, including staff time, which was crucial for the project's success. The council offered specialist insights, introductions to community groups, and a commitment to help deliver, scale, and transfer viable project outcomes.

### Student Engagement in the Public and Collaborative Project

While it is common for us to work with students, we do not have a regular scheduled plan for engagement within course curricula. However, the BA (Hons) Product Design program approached us for a 'social innovation' themed 'client project' for their graduating students. We created a student brief (Appendix 1) that was approved by the course team, even though we did not provide the usual client investment.

### Challenges and Responses in the Green Camden Public and Collaborative Project

#### 1. Identification and Engagement of Communities

We faced challenges in identifying and engaging communities for collaboration. To address this, we worked with Camden Council to crowd-source community collaborators and contexts. We set up a weblog ([http://desisgreencamden.jimdo.com/](http://desisgreencamden.jimdo.com/)) to introduce the project and invite residents to collaborate. The weblog provided a template for residents to describe their design needs, and we aimed to match student groups with community projects.

#### 2. Students' Limited Knowledge and Experience of Service Design and Co-Design

The undergraduate product design students were unfamiliar with service design and co-design methods. They were more comfortable with 3D product design but struggled with the requirement to understand and articulate a collaborative system or enterprise as a service before identifying product design opportunities.

To address this, we taught the students about service design and co-design techniques. We asked them to find examples of existing public and collaborative services, map them as product service systems, and consider the experiences and journeys of those engaging with the service. We also asked them to select a carbon reduction behavior from the list provided by Camden Council and explore how it could be reframed as a public and collaborative service.

### Problems Encountered

- **Lack of Service Design Knowledge**: Despite the course handbook, students had little experience with service design tools and techniques. Introducing these competencies took more time than anticipated.
- **Understanding of Co-Design Approach**: Some students wanted to develop design concepts before engaging with the community, while others rushed mapping activities.
- **Community Engagement Resistance**: Some students were uncomfortable relinquishing control over the authorship of designs within a collaborative process.

### Support from Postgraduate Students

To support the undergraduate students, we involved postgraduate students from the MA Applied Imagination (MAAI) course at CSM. These students, with their advanced experience, provided significant peer-to-peer support.

### Working with Residents â€“ Matchmaking Students and Resident Needs

One of the project's aims was for students to co-create services that residents could implement. We arranged for the Camden Sustainability Team and Green Zone residents to attend student presentations. Each student introduced their proposal and received feedback. The proposals were uploaded to the weblog to facilitate matchmaking between students and resident needs.

### Conclusion

Despite initial challenges, the project provided a valuable learning experience for both students and the community. Future iterations will benefit from more preparation and better alignment with course requirements.
