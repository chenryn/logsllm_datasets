## Abstract
Wireless networking technologies based on the IEEE 802.11 series of standards are vulnerable to various attacks due to the lack of authentication for management frames and network card addresses. These vulnerabilities can lead to denial of service (DoS), session hijacking, and address masquerading attacks. In this paper, we present and implement a specification-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for IEEE 802.11 wireless infrastructure networks. Our IDS not only detects attacks but also monitors policy compliance. The specification used by our IDS is derived from network protocol state transition models and site security policy constraints. We also conduct an experimental and comparative analysis to assess the effectiveness of our approach. The results indicate that our method outperforms existing approaches in detecting a wider variety of attacks.

## 1. Introduction
The need for monitoring computer systems and networks for malicious activity is well-established, and this requirement is particularly urgent in wireless local area networks (WLANs). The broadcast nature of the physical (PHY) layer in wireless networks makes it easy for attackers to gain access to the medium. Flawed legacy encryption schemes like WEP, the forgeability of management frames, and the spoofability of Media Access Control (MAC) addresses combine to make eavesdropping, session hijacking, and DoS attacks a significant threat in WLANs.

Recent enhancements to the IEEE 802.11 standard have improved security, but two factors must be considered. First, transitional security deployment modes that support both obsolete and current security primitives leave the network vulnerable to attacks targeting legacy algorithms. Second, while the extensible authentication protocol (EAP) framework adopted by IEEE 802.11i supports many authentication protocols, few are suitable for wireless environments. These factors increase the configuration burden and highlight the need for techniques to monitor policy compliance and detect intrusions in security-sensitive environments.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) can be classified into misuse-based and anomaly-based systems. Misuse-based IDSs use signatures for attack detection and have a low false positive rate but cannot detect novel attacks. Anomaly-based systems, which identify attacks by detecting deviations from learned normal behavior, can generate more false positives but can detect new attacks. Recent advancements in anomaly-based systems, which define models of correct behavior from explicit policy declarations (specifications), show promise in improving utility and reducing false positives and negatives.

### 1.1. Our Contribution
In this paper, we describe the construction of a specification-based IDS for IEEE 802.11 infrastructure wireless LANs. The correct model of behavior used by our IDS is derived from a specification that combines a model of the underlying protocol state machines with the constraints imposed by the security policy. We report on our implementation and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimentation and comparative analysis. The key contributions of this work include:
1. A description of an approach for constructing an anomaly-based IDS using an extensible specification.
2. Application of the anomaly-based IDS to IEEE 802.11 infrastructure wireless LANs.
3. An experimental and comparative analysis to assess the effectiveness of the technique.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 details the specific threats to infrastructure WLANs. Section 3 covers related work. Section 4 presents our approach to implementing a specification-based IDS and its application to infrastructure WLANs. Section 5 discusses the experimental analysis and comparison with other wireless IDSs. Finally, Section 6 provides conclusions and directions for future work.

## 2. Security of Infrastructure WLANs
Our technique is designed to detect a variety of attacks in infrastructure WLANs, where wireless nodes (STAs) communicate via an access point (AP) connected to a fixed network. We focus on modeling the protocols used between the STAs and the AP.

Early implementations of IEEE 802.11 wireless network components had numerous security weaknesses, some inherent in the protocols and algorithms specified in the 802.11 standard. The 802.11i enhancements to the MAC layer protocols address many of these weaknesses by introducing robust security network associations (RSNAs), which allow mutual authentication, key management, and new data encryption and integrity protocols. However, 802.1X and EAP, used for authentication and access control, were not designed specifically for wireless environments, and many EAP-supported authentication protocols are unsuitable for WLANs. The 802.11i standard allows RSNA and pre-RSNA (e.g., WEP and original 802.11 authentication) to coexist in a transitional security network (TSN), making security rollback attacks possible. Additionally, management frames in 802.11 and 802.11i networks are not authenticated, leaving them vulnerable to spoofing and associated DoS attacks.

We demonstrate that by using a specification based on the state model of the 802.11, 802.1X, and EAP protocols, we can detect a significant number of DoS attacks arising from unauthenticated management and EAP frames. By monitoring protocol executions to ensure that certain constraints are met, we can also detect violations of organizational security policies.

## 3. Related Work
Our work combines state transition modeling with constraints derived from a security policy to construct a specification of correct behavior for an anomaly-based IDS. Previous work in state transition modeling, specification-based intrusion detection, and wireless intrusion detection is relevant to our approach.

Ilgun et al. [9] proposed using state transition analysis for intrusion detection. Our work builds on this foundation but uses state transitions as the basis for a specification-based anomaly detection scheme. Ko [10] first suggested specification-based intrusion detection, requiring the definition of desirable application behavior and subsequent monitoring for violations. Sekar et al. [13] generated a specification-based model of the IP state machine and combined it with statistical machine learning techniques for anomaly detection. Our work differs in that we do not need to superimpose statistical techniques for accurate detection. Tseng et al. [2] applied the specification-based approach to detecting intrusions in ad hoc networks, but our work focuses on infrastructure networks and does not require strong assumptions about MAC addresses.

Current approaches for detecting address spoofing include monitoring MAC frame sequence numbers and verifying MAC addresses against lists of valid users or vendors. These methods are insufficiently robust, as MAC addresses and frame sequence numbers can be changed arbitrarily. Techniques based on monitoring physical characteristics, such as received signal strength indication (RSSI) and round trip time (RTT), have also been proposed. While these parameters are difficult to predict and fabricate, they require fine-tuning of the deployment environment to minimize false positives and negatives.

A significant observation is that existing wireless intrusion detection approaches focus solely on attack detection and do not support policy compliance monitoring, a key contribution of our work.

## 4. Specification-Based Approach
In this section, we describe how a specification is constructed for our IDS and how it can be used by a wireless sensor to monitor a network for both attacks and policy compliance.

At a high level, a passive wireless sensor monitors the radio frequency (RF) spectrum and constructs a state transition model for each STA and associated AP. The sensor is configured with a specification that encapsulates expected state transitions and network security policy constraints. Each frame received by the sensor is evaluated against the specification. If a security constraint is violated or unexpected state transitions occur, the sensor raises an alert.

To illustrate our approach, consider a security-sensitive WLAN deployment within an organization. Following a risk assessment, the organization establishes a security policy requiring the use of a robust security network (RSN) with AES for link layer protection, 802.1X for port-based network access control, and EAP-TLS for mutual authentication between STAs and the network.

The specification used by our IDS consists of two parts: the state transition model and the security policy constraints. The state transition model describes the expected behavior of the protocols, while the security policy constraints ensure that the network operates within the defined security parameters. This dual approach enables the sensor to effectively monitor for both attacks and policy compliance.
