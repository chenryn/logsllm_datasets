Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of the text:

"Confirming the mode of this log. Reading snapshot from: /var/lib/zookeeper/version-2/snapshot.b00000084."

If you need to generalize it, you can use:

"Confirming the mode of this log. Reading snapshot from: <*path_to_snapshot*>."
