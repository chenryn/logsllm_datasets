## About Us: Unicorn Team
Qihoo360’s Unicorn Team is a group of skilled security researchers dedicated to the security of various radio technologies, ranging from small devices like RFID, NFC, and WSN to larger systems such as GPS, UAVs, Smart Cars, Telecom, and SATCOM. Our primary mission is to ensure that Qihoo360 remains impervious to any wireless attacks, thereby protecting both our users and the company. In the course of our research, we develop and produce a variety of devices and systems for both offensive and defensive purposes. We were also vendors at DEF CON 23.

- **Contributions**: Authored popular tutorials on GNU Radio in China and promoted Cloud-RAN technology from 2010 to 2013.
- **Current Role**: Wireless security researcher at Qihoo 360 since 2014.

## The Story Begins: Civilian-Use GPS C/A Signal
The GPS C/A signal, designed for civilian use, is unencrypted, making it vulnerable to replay attacks, a common method of GPS spoofing.

### Initial Experiment: Replay Attack
- **Hardware Used**:
  - USRP B210
  - Active GPS antenna
  - Bias-tee circuit (Mini-Circuit ZX85-12G-S+)
  - LNA (Mini-Circuit ZX60-V82-S+)
- **Process**:
  1. Record GPS signal using USRP B210.
  2. Replay the recorded signal using bladeRF.
- **Result**: Successful! The cellphone received position and timing information from the replayed GPS signal.

### Creating GPS Signals from Scratch
- **Existing Solutions**: Expensive or not free, such as NAVSYS (~$5000) and NI LabVIEW (~$6000).
- **Famous Cases**:
  - **University of Texas at Austin’s RadioNavigation Lab**:
    - [Website](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/)
    - Prof. Todd E. Humphrey and his team
    - 2012 TED talk: How to fool GPS
    - 2013: Spoofing a $80M yacht at sea
    - 2014: Capturing an unmanned aircraft via GPS spoofing

### Our Approach: DIY GPS Simulator
As SDR experts, we have access to USRP, bladeRF, and HackRF. We also found open-source projects online, such as:
- [GPS Toolbox](http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/gps-toolbox/index.html)
- [GNSS-SDR](http://gnss-sdr.org/)
- [GPS Sim HackRF](https://code.csdn.net/sywcxx/gps-sim-hackrf)

### Basic Principles of GPS
- **Pseudo-range Equations**: Calculate delays at the receiver to determine WHEN and WHERE.
- **Message Structure**:
  - 1 bit (20 ms)
  - 1 word (600 ms)
  - 1 subframe (6 s)
  - 1 page (30 s)
  - 25 pages (12.5 min)

### Building the Signal
- **Ephemeris Data**:
  - **Method 1**: Download from CDDIS website (ftp://cddis.gsfc.nasa.gov/gnss/data/daily/)
  - **Method 2**: Use ‘gnss-sdr’ to receive real-time GPS signals and get fresh ephemeris data.
- **Decoding Ephemeris Data**: Use ‘gnss-sdr’ to generate GSDR* files in RINAX format.
- **Generating Navigation Message**: Example: structure of Subframe 2.
- **Matlab Code**: Generate waveform and verify offline with ‘gnss-sdr’ and over-the-air with bladeRF.

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Doppler Effect**:
  - **Moving Towards Receiver**: Delay decreases.
  - **Moving Away from Receiver**: Delay increases.
- **Testing on Cellphones**:
  - **Nexus 5**: Successfully detected pre-set satellites and fixed 3D position.
  - **Samsung Note 3**: Located at Namco Lake in Tibet while physically in Beijing.
  - **iPhone 6**: Positioned at Namco Lake, but positioning was slower. Auto-calibration reset the clock to the wrong time.

### Spoofing Other Devices
- **Cars**: Demo video showing a car located in a lake center.
- **DJI Drones**:
  - **Forbidden Area Policy**: DJI drones are disabled in restricted areas.
  - **Spoofing Demo**: Unlocked a drone in a forbidden area by giving it a fake position in Hawaii.
  - **Hijacking Flying Drone**: Forced a flying drone to land by providing a forbidden position.

### Anti-Spoofing Measures
- **Application Layer**:
  - Prioritize multi-mode positioning (GLONASS, Beidou).
  - Consider cellular network and Wi-Fi positioning.
- **Civil GPS Receiver Chipset**:
  - Implement algorithms to detect spoofing.
- **Civil GPS Transmitter**:
  - Add digital signatures to the extensible GPS civil navigation message.

### Conclusion
GPS remains a robust and widely used global positioning system, with ongoing updates to improve security.
