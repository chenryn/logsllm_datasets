### Exercise and Gateway Testing

An exercise was conducted to evaluate the capabilities of seven gateways. State and federal agencies were also included to demonstrate the breadth of user familiarity with interoperability equipment across all levels of government.

**Recommendation:**
- Consider incorporating communications interoperability as a component in all future exercises.

### Technology Overview for LA/LB Urban Area (UA)

The LA/LB UA is served by several radio systems operating in various public safety frequency bands, including:
- A countywide 800 MHz system
- An Ultra High Frequency (UHF) system in the public safety UHF and UHF-Television bands
- A Very High Frequency (VHF) high-band system
- A VHF low-band system

The cities of Burbank, Culver City, and Glendale share a UHF, digital Motorola SmartZone™ system known as the Interagency Communications Interoperability System. The City of Long Beach operates shared VHF and UHF systems for various departments, including Police, Fire, Public Works, and Health and Human Services.

Interoperability is achieved through shared channels, radio caches, and gateways. The fixed gateway is managed at the Sheriff’s Communications Center (SCC) in Los Angeles. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) and the City of Long Beach have console patching capabilities. There are nine mobile gateways available in the area. The LA Regional Tactical Communications System (LARTCS), located and managed by the SCC, serves as the major fixed gateway. LARTCS plans to design and procure an expanded multiband mutual aid communications system that will provide coverage throughout Los Angeles County, including surrounding national forests.

The Regional Interoperability Steering Committee is planning the construction of a shared P25 UHF trunked radio system covering the UA. Implementation of a shared UHF P25-compliant system would allow the use of multiple vendors.

### Oakland, CA - Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

#### Summary

**Governance: Intermediate Implementation**
- The Interoperable Communications Project Group (ICPG) began meeting in 2003 and oversaw the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) development.
- The group is not formalized, and the UA should clarify governing responsibilities and their relation to the Urban Area Working Group (UAWG).
- Strategic planning efforts have been completed, but a formal plan has not yet been adopted by the included agencies.
- Funding concerns exist, primarily due to reliance on annual federal grants.
- Local leadership is strong, but regional leadership differences may slow progress toward interoperability.

**Recommendations:**
- Identify and document roles, responsibilities, and relationships within the decision-making group (e.g., ICPG membership, relationship to UAWG).
- Develop, document, and formalize agreements (e.g., signed MOUs with defined roles and responsibilities) among all participating agencies.
- Reference all applicable agreements in the TICP and store them in an accessible format.
- Establish a regular review process to ensure agreements remain current and relevant.
- Adopt and implement the regional strategic plan.
- Align regional and state strategic planning efforts to meet regional interoperability needs.
- Develop and implement a regional approach to budgeting and procuring regional communications interoperability assets.
- Develop and implement a long-term (3 to 5 years) sustainable funding plan consistent with the strategic plan.
- Encourage broader involvement by senior government leadership in interoperability funding and procurement plans.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Advanced Implementation**
- The Oakland TICP is based on existing policies and procedures, which are well established and frequently used.
- The UA has taken steps to disseminate and train on the SOPs among participating organizations.
- NIMS/ICS has been used throughout the UA for over a year, with ongoing countywide training.
- The exercise evaluation indicated effective collaboration among Unified Command staff and praised the Communications Unit Leader for resource allocation decisions.

**Recommendations:**
- Schedule a regular review and update process for developed policies and procedures.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Advanced Implementation**
- The UA frequently uses available means of interoperable communications, such as radio caches, gateways, shared channels, and shared systems.
- Proficiency has been reported during real-world events like football games.
- The TICP validation exercise demonstrated successful interoperable communications despite minor technical difficulties.

**Recommendation:**
- Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day activities.

### Technology Overview for Oakland, CA

- The City of Oakland has two ACU-1000 gateways, and the County of Alameda has four deployable Infinimux G4 gateway devices.
- Interoperability is achieved using gateways, shared proprietary radio systems, and NPSPAC channels for mutual aid.
- The County of Alameda has a Motorola 800 MHz trunked communications system.
- Adjacent counties and localities use conventional VHF and UHF communications systems.
- The UA is planning a new P25 standard radio system to create a regional communications system, with a networked gateway system to ensure operable communications during the migration.

### Sacramento, CA - Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

#### Summary

**Governance: Established Implementation**
- The Sacramento UA has two committees: the UASI communications group focused on governance and the SRRCS committee focused on the development and oversight of the shared system.
- Formalized contracts and MOUs are in place for participating local, state, and federal agencies.
- A strategic planning process is in place, but it is unclear if a formal, documented regional strategic plan exists.
- Local political leaders provide policy and fiscal support, and funding is provided through grants and user fees.

**Recommendations:**
- Encourage additional regional, state, and federal agency participation.
- Formalize agreements with needed participants, including additional state and federal organizations.
- Document and implement the regional strategic plan with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance.
- Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to meet regional interoperability needs.
- Incorporate the regional interoperability funding strategy into the strategic plan and consider funding models that leverage local, regional, and statewide efforts.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation**
- The Sacramento UA has formal, region-wide SOPs through its SRRCS structure, in place since 1996.
- The TICP is based on these previously developed policies and has been distributed to all included agencies.
- Additional steps, such as storing applicable SOPs with radio caches and gateways, would support continued dissemination and implementation.
- NIMS/ICS implementation is ongoing, and while some gaps in command and control were identified, the Communications Unit Leader showed proficiency during the TICP validation exercise.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Established Implementation**
- The Sacramento UA primarily uses its 800 MHz shared system, Folsom gateway, and radio caches.
- The TICP validation exercise successfully used state mutual aid channels and tied them to the SRRCS shared system using a gateway device.
- The UA should build on this success by further incorporating state, federal, and support agencies in its TICP and future exercises.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional communications interoperability resources.
- Broaden state and federal agency involvement in training and exercises to facilitate interagency cooperation.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.
