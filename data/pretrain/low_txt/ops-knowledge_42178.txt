The provided system log, spanning from 06:52 to 06:55 on December 4, 2005, documents the initialization and status of several processes. Here is a step-by-step summary:

1. **Initialization of Child Processes:**
   - At 06:52:27, `jk2_init()` identifies a child process (PID 32629) in scoreboard slot 10.
   - From 06:53:04 to 06:55:00, multiple child processes are found and initialized by `jk2_init()`, each assigned to different scoreboard slots:
     - PID 32633 in slot 9
     - PID 32634 in slot 11
     - PID 32632 in slot 7
     - PID 32636 in slot 6
     - PID 32637 in slot 7
     - PID 32638 in slot 9
     - PID 32640 in slot 8
     - PID 32641 in slot 6
     - PID 32642 in slot 7
     - PID 32646 in slot 6
     - PID 32648 in slot 9
     - PID 32652 in slot 7
     - PID 32649 in slot 10

2. **Worker Environment Initialization:**
   - At 06:52:39, the `workerEnv.init()` function successfully initializes using the configuration file `/etc/httpd/conf/workers2.properties`. This success message is repeated at 06:53:23.

3. **Error States:**
   - At 06:52:41, `mod_jk` reports that the `child workerEnv` is in an error state with code 9.
   - Immediately after, at 06:52:41, another error is reported with state code 6.
   - The same error state 6 is reported again at 06:53:26.

**Summary:**
- Multiple child processes were successfully initialized and assigned to various scoreboard slots.
- The `workerEnv` was initialized correctly twice, using the specified configuration file.
- There were recurring errors in the `mod_jk` child `workerEnv`, specifically in states 9 and 6, which may indicate issues requiring further investigation.
