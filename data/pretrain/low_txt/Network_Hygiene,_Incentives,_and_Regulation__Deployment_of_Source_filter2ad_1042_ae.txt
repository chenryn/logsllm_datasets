### Remediation and Market Forces

It is evident that market forces alone are insufficient to address the harm caused by networks lacking Source Address Validation (SAV) to the Internet and the commerce that depends on it. Over the years, numerous efforts have been made to overcome the fundamental issue of misaligned incentives, which hinder the deployment of these technical solutions in a competitive and largely unregulated industry.

From an economic perspective, the failure to deploy SAV can be seen as a negative externality. Networks that allow spoofing reduce their own operational costs but impose costs on others through attacks. The long-term solution, according to economic theory, is to internalize this externality for Internet Service Providers (ISPs). "Naming and shaming" is a weak form of internalization, while stronger forms include liability for damages and various types of regulation. We will explore several potential future scenarios.

### 8.1 Impact of Exogenous Interventions

Section 7 concluded that our project's approach of "naming and shaming" those who do not implement SAV had some positive impact, but it appears to be insufficient based on subsequent measurements from the Spoofer platform. However, the platform provides a valuable benefit by enabling objective evaluation of the effectiveness of attempted interventions.

**Example 1: MANRS Participation**

As of August 2019, the Internet Society had 205 distinct organizations (some with multiple Autonomous Systems, or ASes) participating in the Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS) initiative. Of these, 159 (77.6%) asserted their commitment to SAV on the MANRS website. As part of the onboarding process, MANRS requests that ISPs provide a URL showing the outcome of running Spoofer from a network without a Network Address Translation (NAT) in place.

For the year ending August 2019, we received IPv4 tests from 99 MANRS ASes with no NAT, likely indicating that the ISP member was testing their own network. Only 11 (11.1%) of these ASes could spoof. We also received IPv4 tests from 108 MANRS ASes where a NAT was involved, more likely representing a test from a visitor to a MANRS network. The fraction of these ASes that could spoof (25.0%) was approximately the same as the general population (22.0%, as shown in Figure 4).

In summary, our data shows no evidence that those who assert a commitment to deploy SAV are any more likely to properly deploy it than others.

**Example 2: NSF BCP 38 Language in CC* Solicitations**

We also studied the effect of the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) including Best Current Practice (BCP) 38 language in Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) solicitations from 2014-2016. These yearly solicitations encouraged responding institutions to address BCP 38 in their proposals and use the Spoofer system to test their current network state.

To estimate the impact of this solicitation language, we examined tests belonging to ASes of institutions that were awarded funding from this program and compared them to a control population of institutions that were awarded funding in political science but not in CC*. We looked for tests from an AS: i) between May 2016 and August 2019; ii) in the three-month window between the solicitation posting and the response due date ("window"); iii) anytime prior to the solicitation posting ("before").

We found that few of the institutions who received CC* funding ran the test as requested during the solicitation response window. There were 10 awards in 2014 and 12 in 2016. For both the 2014 and 2016 solicitations, only two awardees in each year ran the test in the window, though 7 and 8, respectively, had run the test at some time before the solicitation. Of the 22 awardees, 3 showed evidence that they had not deployed SAV as of August 2019. In the control population, 2 of 10 awardees ran the test during the CC* solicitation window, 5 before, and none showed evidence of spoofing. We conclude that tying SAV deployment to NSF funding did not have a significant observable impact.

### 8.2 Liability, Insurance, and Industry Standards

If network operators faced costs by assuming liability associated with attacks originating from or transiting their networks, they would have clear incentives to minimize such attacks, including by deploying technologies like SAV. Even the threat of litigation or regulation could change incentives in favor of substantially increasing SAV deployment. This might also motivate insurance companies to require policyholders to provide evidence of consistent SAV deployment.

As the insurance industry underwrites an increasing amount of Internet security risk, it might consider demanding SAV deployment to lower overall exposure. Inbound SAV deployment is already mandated by the widely deployed Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), although §4 shows that inbound SAV deployment is problematic.

Unfortunately, there are at least two stubborn barriers. The first barrier to internalizing these costs via liability for attacks is the general difficulty of attributing attacks reliably, as well as the requirement to prove economic harm. If it were feasible to attribute spoofed Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to a specific party, the associated reputational harm would already present a strong incentive to deploy SAV. A second barrier is the general presumption (enshrined in U.S. law) that networks are intermediaries who are not considered responsible for activity that merely transits their systems.

### 8.3 Regulating Transparency

Requirements for disclosure around network management practices could serve as a stronger "name and shame" regime around SAV deployment. Such rules were part of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Open Internet Orders and recently updated transparency requirements. These requirements may already mandate the disclosure of SAV deployment or non-deployment, as they cover security mechanisms and device attachment rules.

The problem is likely not disclosure but a failure of enforcement and compliance. Our tool could be an excellent arbiter of compliance with this rule, demonstrating publicly whether the network allows spoofing. This data can be useful to insurers, regulators, and consumers wishing to understand network hygiene.

### 8.4 Regulating Government Procurement

If the U.S. Government wanted to take a leading role in increasing the ability of all networks to attribute attacks, thereby improving global cybersecurity, it could require SAV of all agency networks and require Government-contracted ISPs to support SAV as well. A similar effort successfully mandated the availability of all government websites over HTTPS with modern settings under the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo M-15-13. The U.S. National Institutes of Science and Technology has recently included SAV in draft security guidance documents that will represent requirements for all U.S. government agencies.

Sometimes, NIST takes these guidance documents and embodies them in Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) controls, such as for Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) or in other policy initiatives. All such requirements are only partially effective, but they often serve as important catalysts to broader adoption.

There are several further approaches the U.S. government has still not tried: including SAV as a requirement in government-procured networking services; the Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issuing a Binding Operational Directive (BOD); or the OMB issuing a specific policy. We heard one anecdote about SAV being a requirement for Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) technology acquisition guidelines for U.S. federal agencies, where SAV was a requirement right up until the end of the process. When the government asked for input from industry, cloud providers wanted the requirement removed because it was "too hard to implement." This is a disturbing anecdote, as many cloud providers also sell DDoS mitigation services, creating at least the appearance of a conflict of interest.

This episode is reminiscent of the U.S. Anti-Bot Code (ABC) of Conduct for ISPs issued in 2012. The FCC’s Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council (CSRIC) convened a multistakeholder group to create a set of voluntary guidelines on botnet prevention and mitigation. When it was completed, the FCC asked ISPs to publicly acknowledge whether they would comply with the guidelines; the ISPs refused, making it impossible to assess the effectiveness of the guidelines.

### 8.5 Sticky Defaults: Vendor SAV Responsibility

Research has found that default settings have a strong impact on human behavior, even in high-stakes situations where people are well-informed of their choices. An important open question is why, when the benefits of deploying SAV universally are clear and the costs are low and falling, SAV is not universally deployed. Other choices of default settings in networking equipment could radically shift this equilibrium. For example, if instead of providing packets to filter out in network Access Control Lists (ACLs), operators had to select which packets to forward, they would likely make different choices and would, in particular, be unlikely to allow spoofed-source packets. The space of interface design for networking equipment and its impact on security is very much underexplored.

Further confirming the benefit of SAV by default is our conversations with users of the platform over the last three years, where operators think they have deployed SAV but have not verified from all parts of their network. Since SAV is not generally a default configuration on networking equipment, pockets of spoofability can appear with any network equipment upgrade. Similarly, we have noticed many temporary conference wireless networks that support technical meetings within the Internet industry, whose operator has neglected to enable SAV when building the temporary network. While the operator often deploys SAV during the meeting after private notification, the process repeats several months later.

A related issue is network transit providers who hesitate to deploy filtering, such as with Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF), because of the possibility that the filtered customer network could be multihomed to another provider, now or in the future. A router that has deployed uRPF will discard a packet if the interface the packet arrived on is not the best (strict-mode) or a possible reverse path (feasible-mode) interface the router would choose to route packets to that destination. If a multihomed stub AS announces non-overlapping portions of their address space to different transit providers for traffic engineering, the provider network may find it difficult to deploy uRPF. That is, the feasible return path might not be via the interface a router received a packet from. The IETF has recently proposed improvements to filtering techniques to increase their operational robustness in the face of such complexity.

However, we note two compelling empirical facts. First, a stub AS that is not multihomed to more than one transit provider is a candidate for at least feasible uRPF, as the transit provider will receive routes for all prefixes the stub AS uses, even if the customer has multiple physical connections to their provider, or the stub AS will risk not having global connectivity in the event one connection fails. This single-homed stub AS scenario is more common than it used to be and is on the rise. Figure 19 shows that beginning in 2005, as the Internet grew in terms of distinct routing policies (ASes), the trend was for stub ASes to choose a single transit provider. Transit provider ASes can deploy feasible-mode uRPF on these stub ASes without impacting packet forwarding, provided their stub AS customer properly announces prefixes covering all of their address space across each BGP session with their transit provider.

Second, more complex networks also tend to be more capitalized, and our project demonstrates (and publishes) that some of the largest and most complex networks, such as Comcast and AT&T, have successfully implemented SAV throughout their networks. Part of the problem, and an argument for making SAV the default, is the lack of resources (both knowledge and time) required to accurately maintain SAV filtering, confirmed in a 2017 survey of 84 operators. We were gratified to hear that our platform is useful to network operators who wish to verify their own SAV compliance, including after network upgrades that created pockets of spoofability that operators did not expect. If the U.S. government mandated SAV-by-default on its networking equipment vendors, it might lead to SAV becoming the default for equipment sold into enterprise networks as well. In turn, demand for predictability by network technicians would create pressure on vendors who do not do business with the U.S. Government to make SAV a default as well.

Our data indicates that there is limited deployment of uRPF on single-homed BGP customers in the Internet. In Figure 4, 25.2% of IPv4 ASes are at least partially spoofable in the year ending August 2019. For the 438 ASes where feasible-mode uRPF could be deployed, 21.5% of IPv4 ASes are at least partially spoofable.

### 9. Closing Thoughts

The Internet ecosystem, with its academic roots and radically distributed ownership, has long defied traditional governance solutions. For some vulnerabilities, there will be no simple policy solutions. For such vulnerabilities, measurement plays a critical role in quantifying the current attack surface and assessing the effectiveness of proposed interventions. Unlike many other network security hygiene properties, there is no way to audit a network from outside to confirm that it performs SAV. The most valuable contribution of our work has been the establishment of this capability—to prove to an independent third-party auditor that one has properly deployed SAV from a given network.
