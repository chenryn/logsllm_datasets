# Analysis of Network Traffic in Home and Work Environments

## Abstract
This paper presents a comparative analysis of local network traffic in different environments, specifically focusing on home and work settings. By leveraging end-hosts as vantage points, we collected data from over one hundred edge networks, providing a broad and diverse view of traffic patterns. Our findings indicate that wide-area traffic generally dominates, but local traffic is non-negligible in home and work environments. The study also highlights the diversity in the composition of local traffic, which varies by user and network.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
Wide-area traffic has been extensively studied using various methods, including measurements from within the network. However, these studies often fail to capture local traffic at the edge. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing local traffic and comparing it with wide-area traffic using data collected directly from end-hosts via HostView [4].

### 1.2 Objectives
- Compare local and wide-area traffic in different environments.
- Analyze the application mix and characteristics of local traffic.
- Understand the diversity of traffic patterns across multiple networks.

## 2. Data and Methodology

### 2.1 Data Collection
We used HostView, a tool that collects performance measurements and user feedback from end-hosts. Data was gathered from over one hundred different edge networks, including homes, offices, airports, and coffee shops.

### 2.2 Environment Classification
Environments were classified into:
- Home/Local
- Work/Local
- Home/Wide-Area
- Work/Wide-Area

### 2.3 Application Categories
The following application categories were considered:
- Backup
- Chat
- DistantControl
- Email
- Personal
- FileTransfer
- Management
- Miscellaneous
- NameService
- NetworkFS
- P2P
- Printing
- Web
- Unclassified

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Traffic Distribution
Figures 5 and 6 show the distribution of users, volume, and connections by environment. The 'Other' category, which includes unclassified environments, accounts for 12% of the bytes and 18% of the connections. Users are primarily at home or work, which together account for 56% of the connections and 72% of the bytes.

### 3.2 Bytes Transferred
Figure 6 compares the number of bytes transferred at home and work. As expected, there is a similar split between local and wide-area traffic. Most users have more local traffic at work, with only four users showing significant local traffic at home.

### 3.3 Application Mix
#### 3.3.1 Home/Local Traffic
- **Backup**: Absent
- **FileTransfer**: Present, mainly Dropbox
- **Web and Email**: Limited

#### 3.3.2 Work/Local Traffic
- **Backup**: Significant, mainly from a single user
- **FileTransfer**: Present, including FTP and Transmit
- **Web and Email**: Present, but less than wide-area

### 3.4 Connection Characteristics
Figures 11 and 12 show the complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDF) of connection volumes and durations. Wide-area connections are generally larger and longer, while local connections are smaller but can occasionally transfer large amounts of data.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Comparison with Previous Studies
Our findings align with previous studies, such as those by Pang et al. [9], which showed minimal P2P traffic at work and significant file transfer and distant control traffic. However, our study reveals new insights, such as the presence of Dropbox in local traffic, indicating the use of direct LAN connections for synchronization.

### 4.2 User Impact
Single users can significantly impact overall traffic composition. Figures 9 and 10 provide boxplots of the application mix per user, showing that although network file system traffic dominates local traffic, most users have less than 10% of their traffic in this category.

## 5. Related Work

### 5.1 Wide-Area Traffic
Studies such as Caceres et al. [1] and Labovitz et al. [6] have analyzed wide-area traffic from within the network. These studies, however, do not capture local traffic at the edge.

### 5.2 End-Host Studies
Giroire et al. [2] compared network traffic from end-hosts across three environments but did not focus on local traffic. Our study provides a more in-depth analysis of local traffic in multiple environments.

## 6. Summary

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of local network traffic in different environments, highlighting the dominance of wide-area traffic and the non-negligible presence of local traffic in home and work settings. The study contributes to the understanding of traffic patterns and the diversity of local applications in edge networks.
