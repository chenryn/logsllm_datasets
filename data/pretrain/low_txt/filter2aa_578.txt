- Former teenage phone phreak

### Event
Defcon Safe Mode With Networking 2020

### Introduction
- **EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation)**
  - A member-supported nonprofit
  - Dedicated to defending civil liberties
  - Over 30 years of experience

- **Threat Lab**
  - Focuses on identifying and mitigating threats to digital rights and privacy

### Acknowledgment
- **Yomna**
  - Critical contributor to the project
  - Twitter: @rival_elf

### Targeted Groups
- Activists, human rights defenders, journalists, domestic abuse victims, immigrants, sex workers, minority groups, political dissidents, etc.
- Goals of such technology:
  - Gather intelligence on opposition
  - Spy extraterritorially or illegally
  - Locate and capture
  - Extortion
  - Harass and intimidate
  - Stifle freedom of expression

### Our Focus
- Protect at-risk individuals
- Broaden understanding of threats and defenses
- Expose bad actors
- Advocate for better laws

### Previous Projects
- Dark Caracal
- Stalkerware

### Today's Topic
- **Cell-site simulators (CSS), also known as Stingrays or IMSI Catchers**
  - How they work
  - Previous efforts to detect them
  - A new method for detection
  - Solutions to the problem

### Cell Technology Overview
- **UE (User Equipment)**: The phone
- **IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber ID)**: Identifier for the SIM card
- **IMEI (International Mobile Equipment ID)**: Identifier for the hardware
- **eNodeB**: Base station that the UE communicates with
- **EARFCN (E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number)**: Frequency used by UE/eNodeB
- **Sector**: Specific antenna on the base station
- **MIB (Master Information Block)**: Broadcast by eNodeB, contains SIB location
- **SIB (System Information Block)**: Contains details about the eNodeB
- **MCC (Mobile Country Code), MNC (Mobile Network Code), TAC (Tracking Area Code)**: Components of PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network)

### Acronym Clarification
- **IMSI catcher, Stingray, Hailstorm, fake base station == cell-site simulator (CSS)**

### Changes from 2G to 4G
- **Mutual Authentication**: eNodeB and UE authenticate each other
- **Better Encryption**: Enhanced security between eNodeB and UE
- **Selective Connection**: No longer connects to the strongest tower without verification

### 4G CSS Vulnerabilities
- **Pre-authentication Handshake Attacks**
- **Downgrade Attacks**

### Frequency of CSS Usage
- **ICE/DHS**: Hundreds of times per year
- **Local Law Enforcement**: 
  - Oakland: 1-3 times per year
  - Santa Barbara PD: 231 times in 2017
- **Foreign Spies and Cyber Mercenaries**: 
  - IMSI Catchers in DC
  - NSO Group
- **Criminals**: Various instances reported

### Previous Detection Efforts
- **App-Based Solutions**
  - AIMSICD, Snoop Snitch, Darshark
  - **Strengths**: Cheap, easy to use
  - **Weaknesses**: Limited data, high false positives, potential false negatives

- **Radio-Based Solutions**
  - Seaglass, SITCH, Overwatch
  - **Strengths**: Better data, lower-level information
  - **Weaknesses**: Harder to set up, interpret, and higher hardware costs

### Can We Detect 4G IMSI Catchers?
- **Improvements Needed**
  - Lower-level data
  - Comprehensive tower monitoring
  - Data comparison over time
  - Focus on 4G antennas
  - Verification of results

### Introducing Crocodile Hunter
- **Software Stack**
  - Backend: SRSLTE (open-source LTE software stack, C++)
  - Frontend: Python (heuristics, database, display)
  - API for data sharing

- **Hardware Stack**
  - Laptop/Raspberry Pi
  - USB GPS Dongle
  - SDR (BladeRF, Ettus B200)
  - LTE Antennas
  - Battery (for Raspberry Pi)

### Workflow
1. Decode MIB and SIB1 for all visible cells
2. Map probable cell locations
3. Identify anomalies
4. Confirm suspicious cells

### Anomaly Detection
- Cells moving
- Signal strength changes
- Incorrect cell locations
- Changing parameters
- Missing parameters
- New cells

### Legal Considerations
- **Transmission Restrictions**: Due to legal constraints, we do not transmit.

### Findings
- **Dreamforce**: Cell on wheels
- **DC**: Suspicious foreign towers

### Ongoing Tests
- Latin America (FADe Project)
- DC
- NYC
- Your hometown (coming soon)

### Future Work
- Improve heuristics
- Enhance location finding
- Implement machine learning for anomaly detection
- Port to cheaper hardware

### Name Origin
- **Crocodile Hunter**: A tribute to Steve Irwin

### Mitigating CSS
- End 2G support on iOS and Android
- Eliminate pre-authentication messages
- Incentivize standards organizations, carriers, manufacturers, and OEMs to prioritize user privacy

### Key Takeaways
- Clear understanding of 4G vulnerabilities exploited by commercial CSS
- Current IMSI catcher detector apps are insufficient
- Crocodile Hunter offers a new, effective method
- Solving the worst problems of CSS abuse is possible
