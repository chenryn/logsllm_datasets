### Current Behavior

When the form control of an input is updated (e.g., via an async pipe), the `disabled` property of the HTML element is not correctly synchronized with the new form control's `disabled` property.

### Expected Behavior

The `disabled` property of the HTML element should be in sync with the `disabled` property of the corresponding `FormControl`.

### Minimal Reproduction

Please see the following Plunker for a minimal reproduction of the issue:

### Motivation / Use Case

We use dynamic forms with a `BehaviorSubject` to manage the `FormGroup`. When new forms are pushed, all values are updated correctly, but the `disabled` properties do not get updated properly.

### Environment

- **Operating System:** Mac OS X 10.12.3
- **Angular Version:** 2.4.9
  - Note: This issue occurs in version 2.4.9. I will check if it persists in the current 4.0 RC and update this issue accordingly.
- **Browser:** [All | Chrome XX | Firefox XX | IE XX | Safari XX | Mobile Chrome XX | Android X.X Web Browser | iOS XX Safari | iOS XX UIWebView | iOS XX WKWebView]
- **Language:** TypeScript 2.0.2
