# Description of the New Feature/Enhancement
Currently, it is not possible to set `colorScheme` or `padding` at a global level; these settings can only be configured on a per-profile basis.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)
To enhance flexibility and consistency, all settings that can be configured per profile—excluding obvious ones such as `name` and `guid`—should also be available for configuration at a global level. This would allow users to define default values that apply across all profiles, while still retaining the ability to override these settings on a per-profile basis if needed.
