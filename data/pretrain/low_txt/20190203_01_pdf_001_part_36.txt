### Table List
- **Table List**: This list displays the currently selected tables in the calling dialog box. Each selected table is indicated by a check mark in its checkbox.

### Local List
- **Local List**: This is a temporary, internal copy of the table list managed by the wildcard selector. The wildcard selector allows you to add or remove tables from the local list. When you click the "Done" button in the Wildcard Selector dialog box, the local list becomes the table list, and the selected tables appear in the calling dialog box.

### Unselected Tables
- **Unselected Tables**: These are tables that are eligible but not yet selected for the operation. When you click the "Filter List" button, the unselected tables that match the filter pattern are listed in the "Available Tables" field of the Wildcard Selector dialog box. To list all unselected tables, use the percent sign (%) as the filter pattern.

### Selected Tables
- **Selected Tables**: These are the tables you have selected for the operation. They comprise the local list. To display selected tables that match a filter pattern, add an asterisk (*) immediately after the filter pattern. Each selected table has a check mark in its checkbox.

### Using the Wildcard Selector
1. **Preselect Tables**:
   - Before opening the Wildcard Selector dialog box, you can preselect tables from the list of available tables in the calling dialog box by adding a check mark to the checkbox of each table.
   - Click the "Use Wildcard Selection" button in the calling dialog box to open the Wildcard Selector dialog box. The preselected tables will be included in the local list used by the wildcard selector.

2. **Filter Available Tables**:
   - The "Available Tables" field displays the filtered list matching the pattern entered in the "Filter Pattern" text field.
   - When the Wildcard Selector dialog box is initially opened, the default filter pattern is the percent sign (%), which returns all eligible, unselected tables.

3. **Narrow Down Table Selection**:
   - Enter a pattern in the "Filter Pattern" text field to narrow down your desired table selection. Click the "Filter List" button to display the tables that match the pattern.

4. **Select Tables for Local List**:
   - Select tables from the "Available Tables" list that you want to add to the local list by placing a check mark in each table’s checkbox. You can also click the "Select All" checkbox to select all tables and then individually deselect certain tables by removing their check marks.

5. **Apply Selections to Local List**:
   - Click the "Apply Selections to Local List" button to add the selected tables to the local list. The selected tables will be removed from the "Available Tables" list.

6. **Repeat Filtering and Selection**:
   - Repeat steps 3 through 5 as many times as needed using different filter patterns to add all desired tables to the local list.

7. **Display and Deselect Tables**:
   - Use the asterisk (*) after the pattern to display previously selected tables comprising the local list. Each selected table has a check mark in its checkbox.
   - Remove selected tables from the local list by clicking on each table’s checkbox to remove the check mark.

8. **Finalize Local List**:
   - When the local list contains all of your desired, selected tables, click the "Done" button. The Wildcard Selector dialog box closes, and the local list becomes the list of selected tables displayed by the calling dialog box.
   - Alternatively, if you do not wish to apply the local list, click the "Cancel" button. The local list changes are discarded, and the table list of the calling dialog box remains unchanged.

9. **Reinvoke Wildcard Selector**:
   - You can invoke the wildcard selector again and repeat the process to add or remove tables from the table list by starting with Step 1.

### Creating a Schedule
- A schedule establishes recurring points in time when replication is to occur. Ensure that an initial snapshot replication has been performed from the master definition node to every other master node in the multi-master replication system. If a newly added master node did not undergo an initial snapshot, subsequent synchronization replications may fail.

#### Single-Master Replication (SMR)
- Once a schedule is created, the subscription server initiates replications according to the schedule until it is changed or removed.

#### Multi-Master Replication (MMR)
- In MMR, the publication server handles the scheduling process.

### Components Required for Scheduled Replication
- **Publication Database Server**
- **Subscription Database Server** (for SMR only)
- **Publication Server**
- **Subscription Server** (for SMR only)

If any of these components are not running at the scheduled time, the replication does not occur and is rescheduled for the next time when all components are running.

### Synchronization Replications
- **Trigger-Based Method**: Pending transactions are maintained in the shadow tables of the source database.
- **Log-Based Method**: Changes are persisted using Java object serialization to files on the host running the publication server. All changes since the last successful replication are applied during the next scheduled replication.

### Snapshot Replications
- Skipped, scheduled replications present no problem since a snapshot replication replaces all data in the target tables with the current source data.

### Steps to Create a Schedule
1. **Select the Node**:
   - **SMR**: Select the Subscription node of the subscription for which you wish to create a schedule.
   - **MMR**: Select the Publication Database node designated as the controller database.

2. **Open the Scheduled Task Wizard**:
   - **SMR**: From the Subscription menu, choose "Schedule" > "Configure Schedule", or right-click the Subscription node and choose "Configure Schedule".
   - **MMR**: Right-click the Publication Database node and choose "Configure Schedule".

3. **Choose Replication Type**:
   - Select either "Synchronization Replication" or "Snapshot Replication". For a snapshot-only publication, only "Snapshot" can be chosen. In MMR, only "Synchronize" can be chosen.

4. **Set Replication Frequency**:
   - Choose the frequency: Continuously, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Cron Expression. See Section 10.4.3 for directions on writing a cron expression.

5. **Review and Finish**:
   - Review the schedule and click "Finish" to accept it.

### Managing a Schedule
- **Updating a Schedule**:
  - Follow the same steps as creating a schedule, but select the existing schedule and make the necessary changes.
  
- **Removing a Schedule**:
  - Select the node and open the Scheduled Task Wizard. Confirm the removal and proceed.

### Conclusion
- Ensure all components are running for scheduled replications to occur. Use the wildcard selector to manage table selections and the Scheduled Task Wizard to manage replication schedules.
