### Title: Analysis of Industrial Protocol Gateways in the Context of Black Hat US-20

With the advent of Industry 4.0, there is an increasing need to integrate legacy devices, such as serial control servers and programmable logic controllers (PLCs), into modern IT networks and the Internet (e.g., cloud services). To facilitate this integration, protocol gateways are used to convert industrial control system (ICS) protocols, enabling communication between IP-based networks and serial devices, and vice versa.

While previous research has highlighted that protocol gateways may be vulnerable to local operating-system exploits, the extent to which these gateways can withstand attacks or misuse remains unclear. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive security evaluation of five popular protocol gateways from different vendors. Our analysis uncovered several categories of security vulnerabilities that, if exploited by malicious actors, could compromise or disrupt the operations of industrial facilities.

Through our collaboration with a major bug bounty program, we identified and reported nine zero-day vulnerabilities. We are currently working with the affected vendors to address these issues and improve the overall security posture of their products.

In this presentation, we will share the findings of our research, discuss the potential impact of the identified vulnerabilities, and propose effective countermeasures. This work is a collaborative effort involving Philippe Lin, Ryan Flores, Charles Perine, Rainer Vosseler, and external researcher Luca Bongiorni.
