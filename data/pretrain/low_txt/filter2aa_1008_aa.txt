### Genesis

**Question:** Who is researching this?

- **Windows:** 4,951 vulnerabilities
- **Mac OSX:** 2,270 vulnerabilities
- **z/OS (mainframe):** 0 vulnerabilities (Source: cvedetails.com)

**Observation:** 
- The absence of reported vulnerabilities for z/OS raises significant questions. 
- IBM's "System"z" believes that the details of security and integrity APARs (Authorized Program Analysis Reports) should not be made publicly available.
- Given the critical workloads running on these systems, the impact of a vulnerability being exploited could severely damage customer operations and business.
- One benefit of not providing vulnerability details is that both external attackers and internal personnel threats cannot access information that could put an enterprise at undue risk. (Source: ibm.com, DOC #ZSQ03054SUSENS03)
