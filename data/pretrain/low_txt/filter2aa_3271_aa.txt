# Personal Introduction

- 11 years of experience in Information Security (InfoSec), with an additional 5 years of hobby work.
- Primary interests: penetration testing, intrusion detection, and log correlation.
- Currently employed as an InfoSec generalist at a cloud provider.
- Previously worked at several Fortune 100 companies.

# What is the Cloud?

- Leverages the highly scalable Internet infrastructure to provide multiple users with on-demand access to data, applications, and services.
- Utilizes shared or virtualized resources to reduce costs, complexity, and increase flexibility.
- For the purpose of this discussion, we will focus on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS).

# A Weapon of Mass Destruction?

- **DefCon 17**: "Clobbering the Cloud" by SensePost.
- **DefCon 18**: "Cloud Computing: A Weapon of Mass Destruction?" by Bryan/Anderson.
- Cloud providers often do not internally police their clients.
- Unofficial policy: "As long as no complaints are received, nothing will be done."

# Vulnerabilities of the Cloud

- **Easy Access**: Simplified access can lead to increased security risks.
- **Anonymity/Fraud**: The cloud's anonymity can facilitate fraudulent activities.
- **Contention for Resources**: Shared resources can lead to performance and security issues.

# Threats to the Cloud Provider

- **Infrastructure Damage**: Potential damage to the cloud provider’s infrastructure.
- **Fraudulent/Nonpaying Clients**: Clients who may not pay or engage in fraudulent activities.
- **Proven Inability to Address Security**: Historical evidence of poor security practices.

# Threats to the Client

- **Multi-Tenant Environment**: A single compromised client can affect others.
- **Data Compromise**: Users may be unaware that their data has been compromised.

# Current Practices of Cloud Providers

- Treating cloud security as a traditional hosting environment.
- Providing clients with a virtual firewall and inline Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) services.
- Offering free vulnerability assessments.
- Each client’s virtual instance is independent, leaving clients to fend for themselves without coordinated enterprise security.

# Conventional Solutions: IPS

- **Challenges**:
  - Difficult to offer prepackaged IPS that works for all clients and doesn’t block legitimate traffic.
  - Information from IPS is often incomplete due to encryption and lack of endpoint awareness.
  - In-line IPS must operate at line speeds, limiting the ability to perform complex correlations.

# Conventional Solutions: Traditional Design

- Focuses on external threats.
- Assumes internal hosts are trusted.
- Clients cannot benefit from security data generated by other clients.

# Observations on Security Posture

- I cannot definitively state the security posture inside a company.
- I can infer the nature of the security posture based on network and personnel behaviors.
- Guesses are based on the frequency of contact and the time it takes for a host to stop contacting my network.
- Data from the first six months of 2011 (AWS):
  - A single recurring host from AWS, which, given their size, is a good indicator.
  - Example: 
    - **April 20, 2011, 06:54:50 PDT**: Firewall Block: 122.248.246.104 (Sweep)
    - **April 20, 2011, 06:54:54 PDT**: Complaint: 122.248.246.104
    - **April 20, 2011, 21:34:48 PDT**: Firewall Block: 122.248.246.104 (AdminProtocol)
    - **April 20, 2011, 21:34:49 PDT**: Complaint: 122.248.246.104
  - Based on this, Amazon’s response time to complaints/incidents is at least 14.5 hours.

# Rackspace/Slicehost

- 10 recurring hosts from Rackspace.
- Example:
  - **March 17, 2011, 22:18:36 PDT**: Firewall Block: 184.106.187.15 (Sweep)
  - **March 17, 2011, 22:18:37 PDT**: Complaint: 184.106.187.15
  - **March 19, 2011, 22:45:10 PDT**: Firewall Block: 184.106.187.15 (Sweep)
  - **March 19, 2011, 22:45:11 PDT**: Complaint: 184.106.187.15
- Based on this, Rackspace’s response time to complaints/incidents is greater than 48 hours.

# Soklayer

- 5 recurring hosts from Soklayer, all spanning multiple days.
- Soklayer never responds to complaints or incidents, or if they do, the response time is measured in months.
- Example:
  - **February 14, 2011, 02:46:37 PST**: Firewall Block: 174.37.237.66 (Sweep)
  - **February 14, 2011, 02:46:38 PST**: Complaint: 174.37.237.66
  - **April 19, 2011, 04:26:09 PDT**: Firewall Block: 174.37.237.66 (Sweep)
  - **April 19, 2011, 04:26:11 PDT**: Complaint: 174.37.237.66

This structured and professional format should make the information more clear and accessible.
