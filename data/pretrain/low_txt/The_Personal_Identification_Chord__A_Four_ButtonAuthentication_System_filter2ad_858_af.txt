### Robustness to Guessing Attacks

The Personal Identification Chord (PIC) is more robust to guessing attacks compared to traditional PINs. This can be attributed to the less skewed distribution of individual taps used in PIC-free (see Figure 6). In total, 46% of PINs contained repeating items, which can facilitate guessing attacks that exploit repetitive item patterns. In contrast, only 27% of PIC-free PICs contained repeating tap patterns (see Table 8). This observation is further supported by additional evidence suggesting that PINs may be easier to compromise: a significantly higher number of participants reported using personal information such as birth dates or ID numbers to compose their PINs. Conversely, PIC participants reported using rhythms and shapes as mnemonics. This evidence suggests that PICs may be stronger against rule-based guessing attacks that exploit personal information [5].

### Implications of Mandating Dual-Taps

The second research question in the third study aimed to explore whether PIC security could be improved with policies that mandate dual-taps. Surprisingly, the answer is no; guessing entropy was highest for PIC-free. This unexpected result highlights an incorrect assumption that dual-taps would be, proportionately, less frequently used than single taps. The ease with which participants were able to enter many of the dual-taps made them a frequent component of users' PICs. Based on the data from the third study, a more appropriate policy might be to encourage users to include the most infrequently used taps: 1+2, 2+4, 4, and 1+3. Notably, two of these taps are horizontal dual-taps, suggesting participants may have been reluctant to use this category in particular (see Table 7).

### Limitations

Several limitations impact this work. In the recall study, the sample size is sufficient only to make predictions about guessing entropy; larger samples would be required to fully establish it. Furthermore, the virtual "sweet" voucher may have distorted the participants' PIN and PIC selection behaviors. PINs and PICs collected in the study may be stronger than those used to protect real watches. However, since the same incentive applied to all policies, both PIN and PIC selections would have been affected in a similar way.

### Related Work

Textual passwords remain the most widely implemented authentication method due to their ease of deployment and familiarity [4, 16]. Even if alternative schemes such as biometrics are used to secure a device, traditional passwords typically remain in place as a parallel authentication system and to manage biometric credentials, access rights, and data (e.g., Apple’s Touch ID). However, entering textual passwords on small virtual keyboards available on mobile devices can be challenging [12, 19, 24, 28, 32]. Zezschwitz et al. [32] found that passwords used on mobile devices are shorter and contain fewer symbols and uppercase letters. Melicher et al. [24] also found that creating passwords on mobile devices takes significantly longer and is more error-prone.

Only a few studies have focused on the analysis of screen lock usability for smartwatches. Nguyen and Memon [25] evaluated the usability of popular locking mechanisms for smartwatches and found that conventional PINs and patterns are more usable than newer methods like "draw PIN" and "voice PIN." Zhao et al. [35] conducted a similar study, focusing on how watch sizes and layouts (square and circular) affect the usability of PINs and patterns. The most preferred method was patterns, even though 75% of participants were concerned with their finger movements on small watch screens. They used mobile phones (and not smartwatches) and simulators to conduct that study. To our knowledge, we are the first to fully implement a smartwatch-focused password entry system and study its usability and security in a multi-day setting.

Schaub et al. [28] evaluated the usability of textual password entry on mobile devices. Jakobsson and Akavipat used multi-word passphrases with auto-correction to improve the speed of password entry [19]. Numerous graphical patterns [9, 31] and biometric authentication schemes [2, 22] have been proposed for mobile devices. Despite the availability of many screen lock schemes, PINs remain popular, with about 33.6% of mobile users using PINs [14]. Moreover, before activating biometric authentication, most mobile devices require users to first set up their dominant locks in the form of PINs, passwords, or patterns [8]. Therefore, the overall security is often determined by the robustness of user-chosen PINs. However, most users choose easy-to-remember PINs that are vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Bonneau et al. [5] showed that many users use memorable dates (e.g., birth dates) as PINs, and an effective guessing attack would involve brute-forcing PINs with dates. The results presented in the "Remembrance Techniques" section confirm this, showing that half of the PIN participants used their personal information to create easily recallable PINs.

PIN complexity policies can help users choose stronger PINs. Kim et al. [20] studied the effectiveness of numerous PIN complexity policies, showing that enforcing a blacklist of commonly used PINs can help users choose more secure PINs that are also memorable. As mentioned in the "PIC Policies" section, Apple uses a warning policy to help users avoid using weak PINs like 0000, 1111, or 1234. In contrast to existing literature on PIN complexity policies, however, our analyses of the PIC-dual and PIC-dual-rand policies showed that not all policies are effective in improving PIC security, and such policies must be designed carefully to address the PIC selection biases discovered in this paper.

### Conclusions

This paper explores authentication on smartwatches. It first captures current opinions and behaviors via an interview study with current watch owners. Based on their concerns about the difficulty and inconvenience of authentication, we propose PICs, a novel authentication input based on chorded input on four large, easily targeted buttons. Two studies then assess the value of the PIC design. A keypress-level usability study suggests that PIC performance is modestly slower and more error-prone than PIN during standard input but leads to fewer errors in a challenging, GUI-free input condition. A recall study shows that both PICs and PINs achieve high recall rates and input accuracy, with PIC requiring additional time for setup and, more modestly, for recall. Security analyses based on an objective assessment of partial guessing entropy and a subjective assessment of PIN/PIC selection strategies indicate that PICs may offer improved resistance to brute force attacks and to attacks based on knowledge about a watch owner. Future work will seek to establish the real-world impact of these variations by assessing input performance of PIN and PIC during real smartwatch use and include comparisons with other common authentication techniques such as pattern lock. We will also investigate guessing attacks on PICs with a larger sample, capture additional data on PIC generation strategies, and explore the susceptibility of PIC entry to other common forms of attack such as shoulder surfing.
