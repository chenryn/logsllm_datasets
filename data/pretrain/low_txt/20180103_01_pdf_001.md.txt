### 1. Background

#### 1.1. Need and Motivation for 3D City Models
- A 3D city model is a representation of an urban environment with three-dimensional geometry of common urban objects and structures, with buildings being the most prominent feature.
- 3D city models can be applied in various domains for environmental simulation and decision support.

#### 1.2. 3D Data Models
- **Geometrical Models:** Define geometric objects and elements, consisting of different spatial objects (points, linestrings, etc.) and their properties. Examples include COLLADA, VRML, X3D, etc.
- **Semantic Models:** Define entities and their non-spatial characteristics and relationships among the entities. Examples include CityGML, IFC, gbXML, etc.

#### 1.3. 3D Data Types
- **Boundary Representation (B-Rep):** 3D objects are represented by their boundaries.
- **Voxel Elements:** 3D objects are represented by voxel elements.
- **Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG):** 3D objects are represented by a combination of basic blocks.

#### 1.4. General Taxonomy of 3D Use Cases
- **Category 1: Applications Based on Geometry**
  - Example: Estimation of shadow
- **Category 2: Analysis Based on Geometry and Semantic Information**
  - Example: Estimation of solar potential
- **Category 3: Analysis Based on Domain-Specific Extensions and External Data**
  - Example: Noise emission calculation
- Note: Categories are not mutually exclusive in all cases.

### 2. CityGML

#### 2.1. Overview
- **Open Data Model:** XML-based format used for storing and exchanging virtual 3D objects and city models among applications.
- **Geometrical and Semantic Model:** Implements both geometrical and semantic information.
- **Application Schema:** Implemented as an application schema for Geography Markup Language 3 (GML3).
- **Multi-Scale Modeling:** Supports multi-scale modeling according to the required level of detail in different applications.

#### 2.2. Multi-Scale Modeling
- **LOD-0:** 2D footprint.
- **LOD-1:** Block model of building.
- **LOD-2:** Adds differentiated roof structure and thematically differentiated surfaces.
- **LOD-3:** Architectural model with detailed wall and roof structure.
- **LOD-4:** Adds interior structures for 3D objects like rooms, interior doors, and stairs.

#### 2.3. Spatial-Semantic Coherence
- **CityGML:** Complex objects with structured geometry and semantics.
- **KML:** Only unstructured geometry, no semantics.

### 3. IIRS Initiatives Using 3D City Models

#### 3.1. Estimation of Solar Irradiation
- **Objective:** Estimate the effective percentage of roof/wall/window of a building that contributes to harnessing solar energy.
- **Stages:**
  1. **3D Building Model Generation:**
     - Building footprints captured from Cartosat-1.
     - 3D model of LOD-3 created using SketchUp/CityEngine.
  2. **Semantic Dissection of 3D Model:**
     - Transformation of Collada model to CityGML using Feature Manipulation Engine (FME).
     - Loading CityGML to PostgreSQL/PostGIS and storing semantic information into RDBMS for semantic queries.
  3. **Simulating Sun Illumination for Solar Energy Estimation:**
     - Conversion of CityGML to gbXML.
     - Enrichment of semantic information with additional energy simulation class attributes.
     - Simulation of building information model (BIM) into solar energy estimation using Sun-Earth geometry.

#### 3.2. Traffic Noise Modeling
- **Objective:** Analyze and visualize traffic noise for smart city planning.
- **Stages:**
  1. **Field Data Collection:**
     - Collection of traffic data and noise level samples.
  2. **3D Model Generation:**
     - Reconstruction of LOD-0 model (satellite image processing).
     - Reconstruction of LOD-2 model (terrestrial laser scanner).
  3. **3D GIS Analysis & Visualization:**
     - Storage in PostGIS, 3D City DB, and conversion to CityGML for semantic analysis and integration.
     - Traffic noise analysis using empirical relationship.
     - Spatial query at the semantic level, rendering, and visualization.

#### 3.3. Interoperability Model
- **Study of 3D Data Models:** Collada (*.dae), gbXML, IFC, and OGC-based CityGML.
- **Mapping of Base Elements:** For storage and exchange of virtual 3D city models.
- **Improving 3D Models:** With geometry and semantics in a single model considering all levels of detail (LOD-0 to LOD-4).
- **Surface Model (B-Rep):** For 3D representations.

#### 3.4. Indoor Logistics
- **Indoor Mapping:** Accurate floor plan mapping and 3D visualization.
- **Indoor Positioning:** Mapping points of interest and static content.
- **Indoor Locating:** Locating mobile devices and other dynamic content.
- **Indoor Routing & Analysis:** Indoor routing and management of business processes with GIS analysis tools.
- **Indoor Asset Tracking:** Tracking mobile assets for dispatching and operational efficiency.

#### 3.5. 3D Indoor Routing
- **Model Creation:** 3D models of buildings created in SketchUp and imported as Collada Model into ArcScene.
- **Network Dataset:** Created in ArcScene, including pathways and staircases inside and outside the buildings.
- **Routing Model:** Designed in Model Builder of ArcScene, showing optimal routes between starting and end points.
