## Abstract
This paper presents Facebook's design and operational experience with a Hose-based backbone network planning system. The adoption of the Hose model in network planning is driven by the need to address capacity and demand uncertainty in backbone expansion. The Hose model abstracts the aggregated traffic demand per site, allowing peak traffic flows at different times to be multiplexed, thereby saving capacity and buffering traffic spikes. Our core design involves heuristic algorithms to select Hose-compliant traffic matrices and cross-layer optimization between the optical and IP networks. We evaluate the system performance in production and share insights from years of operational experience. Hose-based network planning can save 17.4% capacity and reduce traffic drops by up to 75% under fiber cuts. As the first study of its kind, our work has the potential to inspire further research.

## 1. Introduction
Global online service providers, such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon, build wide-area backbone networks to connect thousands of Point-of-Presence (PoP) sites and hundreds of Data Centers (DCs) across continents. To keep up with the explosive traffic growth, significant investments are made in expanding and upgrading the backbone network. Effective network planning is crucial for devising capacity-efficient network build plans that are resilient to unforeseen demand uncertainties, such as service changes and traffic dynamics.

Facebook achieves this goal by adopting the Hose model in backbone planning. Traditionally, backbone planning was based on the Pipe model, which abstracts pairwise traffic demands between network sites. This approach requires provisioning for the peak demand between every site pair, leading to a "sum of peak" traffic capacity. In contrast, the Hose model abstracts the aggregated ingress and egress traffic demands per site, allowing for "peak of sum" traffic capacity. Since peak traffic demands across different sites are unlikely to occur simultaneously, the Hose model offers multiplexing gain, saving total capacity and providing headroom for traffic uncertainties after deployment.

In addition to capacity savings and resilience, Hose-based planning aligns with the industry trend of decoupling service logic from infrastructure design. Services are frequently migrated between DCs for load balancing, scaling, latency reduction, and maintenance. Accurate point-to-point traffic demand forecasting becomes challenging, and new DCs are built annually, making it difficult to estimate future traffic demands. The Hose model simplifies this by specifying aggregated traffic demand per site, enabling the network to scale per-node basis, similar to storage and compute resources.

However, despite these advantages, the capacity must still be allocated in a point-to-point manner. Our challenge is to convert the Hose per-site traffic into Pipe pairwise traffic. The Hose model, originally designed for Virtual Private Network (VPN) provisioning and later used for Virtual Machine (VM) placement in the cloud, has not been applied to network planning. Thus, we cannot rely on existing solutions.

Our main contribution is a solution to this problem. We propose heuristic algorithms to generate a small subset of traffic matrices (TMs) that represent the Hose space. We also share practical considerations from Facebook's production network planning process, including short-term and long-term planning, interaction between optical and IP networks, failure resilience, and cross-layer capacity optimization. Our evaluation shows that Hose-based planning can save 17.4% capacity and drop up to 75% less traffic under unplanned failures.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the Hose model to network planning, and we hope to inspire further research in this area.

## 2. Motivation for Hose
In this section, we use production traffic data to demonstrate the advantages of Hose-based backbone planning in terms of capacity savings and resilience to traffic uncertainties.

### Experimental Setup
We collected production traffic data between every site pair on the Facebook North America backbone from November 23, 2020, to December 28, 2020. To eliminate time-of-day effects, we focused on the busy hour, when the total traffic in the backbone is highest. Traffic was sampled once per minute, resulting in 60 data points. For the Pipe model, we used the 90th percentile of these data points as the peak traffic demand for each site pair. For the Hose model, we summed the ingress/egress traffic per site for each data point and used the 90th percentile of the 60 data points as the peak Hose traffic demand. This method provided the "daily peak" traffic demands for both models.

In production, we typically smooth traffic demands using a moving average. Following Facebook's standard, we averaged the daily peak demands over a 21-day window and added three times the standard deviation of the 21-day data as a buffer for sudden traffic spikes. This method produced the "average peak" traffic demand per Hose site and per Pipe site pair.

### Traffic Reduction
The key difference between Hose- and Pipe-based planning is the "peak of sum" vs. "sum of peak" traffic. The Hose model allows for less capacity due to the multiplexing gain, as simultaneous peaks in Pipe traffic are unlikely. Figure 2 shows the relative reduction in total traffic demand using the Hose model compared to the Pipe model. The "daily peak" demand for Hose (red dashed curve) is 10%-15% lower than Pipe, and the "average peak" demand (black solid curve) is 20%-25% lower. This suggests significant capacity savings can be achieved by adopting the Hose model.

### Tolerance to Traffic Dynamics
The multiplexing effect also means that the Hose model can handle more traffic variations. Figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the total daily peak traffic demand. For confidentiality, the absolute traffic volume is normalized against the maximum demand (from the Pipe model). The vertical line at \( x = 0.55 \) corresponds to 90% of the days in the Hose model and 40% in the Pipe model. This indicates that if we plan for 55% of the maximum total demand, the daily peak demand will be satisfied for 90% of the days in the Hose model, compared to only 40% in the Pipe model. The higher percentile in the Hose model indicates better tolerance to traffic uncertainties.

### Stable Traffic Demand
We also measured the variance of Hose and Pipe traffic across days using the coefficient of variation. The results show that the Hose model provides more stable traffic demand, making it more resilient to unexpected traffic spikes.
