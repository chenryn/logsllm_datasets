## Abstract
This paper introduces a hierarchical modeling framework for the dependability evaluation of Internet-based applications, illustrated through a travel agency example. The model encompasses four levels: user, function, service, and resource. The first level describes how users interact with the application, while the remaining levels detail the handling of user requests at different abstraction layers. The user-perceived availability measure accounts for both traditional and performance-related failures. Sensitivity analysis results are provided to demonstrate the impact of various assumptions, such as user operational profiles, travel agency architecture, and fault coverage.

## 1. Introduction
The increasing use and diversity of Internet applications have made it crucial to assess the dependability of services as perceived by users. The Internet is frequently used for critical transactional applications like online banking, stock trading, reservation processing, and shopping, where service interruptions can have severe consequences. For e-business providers and developers, evaluating the user-perceived quality of service is essential. This involves analyzing how hardware, software, and infrastructure affect the quality of service during the design phase.

Internet-based applications often run on distributed infrastructures with multiple interconnected layers of software and hardware components, including web, application, and database servers. Three key players are involved in delivering these services: 
1. Users (customers)
2. E-business provider (eBP), who implements the e-business functions
3. External suppliers

While the eBP has full control over its architecture, limited information is available for the dependability of external suppliers' services. Remote measurements can be used to evaluate parameters characterizing these services, which can then be incorporated into models assessing the impact of eBP component failures and repairs on user-perceived dependability.

Given the complexity of the system and the challenge of combining various types of information, a systematic and pragmatic approach is necessary for constructing dependability models. Our work [11] proposes a hierarchical framework for modeling the user-perceived dependability of e-business applications. This framework decomposes the target application into four levels: user, function, service, and resource. 

This paper aims to illustrate the main concepts of this modeling framework using a web-based travel agency (TA) as an example. The objectives are:
1. To demonstrate the application of our framework based on the decomposition of the target application.
2. To present typical dependability analysis and evaluation results to aid service providers in making informed design decisions.

The user-perceived dependability measure considers the combined impact of performance-related and traditional software and hardware failures. Sensitivity analysis results are provided to show the impact of various assumptions on the user-perceived availability.

## 2. Dependability Modeling Framework
The information needed for dependability modeling and analysis is structured into four levels:

- **User Level**: Describes the user operational profile in terms of the types of functions invoked and their activation probabilities.
- **Function Level**: Describes the set of functions available at the user level.
- **Service Level**: Describes the main services required to implement each function and their interactions. Services are categorized as internal (delivered by the eBP) and external (provided by external suppliers).
- **Resource Level**: Describes the architecture on which the services are implemented. At this level, the eBP's architecture, fault tolerance, and maintenance strategies are detailed. Each external service is represented as a single resource (black box).

The dependability modeling and evaluation step is directly related to the system's hierarchical description. Figure 1 illustrates this, showing how the availability measures (denoted by A(x)) are computed at each level. Various techniques, such as fault trees, reliability block diagrams, Markov chains, and stochastic Petri nets, can be used to model each level. The selection of the appropriate technique depends on the dependencies between elements and the quantitative measures to be evaluated.

Our hierarchical description builds on concepts proposed in [13] for analyzing the performance of e-business applications but is adapted and refined to focus on dependability.

## 3. The Travel Agency (TA) Example
The TA allows users to plan and book trips over the web by interacting with flight reservation systems (e.g., AF, KLM), hotel reservation systems (e.g., Sofitel, Holiday Inn), and car rental systems (e.g., Hertz). The TA consists of two main components: the client side and the server side.

- **Client Side**: Handles user inputs, performs necessary checks, and forwards data to the server side.
- **Server Side**: Responds to calls from the client side concerning availability checking, booking, payment, and cancellation. It handles all transactions with booking systems, composes items into full trips, converts incoming data, and handles exceptions.

### 3.1. Function and User Levels
The user behavior when accessing the TA website is characterized by an operational profile (Figure 2). The nodes "Start" and "Exit" represent the beginning and end of a user visit, while other nodes identify the functions invoked by users. For illustration, we consider five functions:

- **Home**: Accessed when a user visits the TA home page.
- **Browse**: Navigates through links to view pages, including promotions, help, and queries.
- **Search**: Checks the availability of trip offers based on user criteria and returns search results.
- **Book**: Confirms the reservation of a chosen trip.
- **Pay**: Processes the payment for booked trips.

The transitions and associated probabilities (pij) describe how users interact with the TA website. These probabilities can be obtained by collecting data from the website.

The operational profile defines all user execution scenarios. Each scenario is defined by the set of functions invoked and their activation probabilities. Identifying the most frequently activated scenarios provides insights into the significant scenarios for evaluating user-perceived dependability. Table 1 lists the user execution scenarios derived from Figure 2, along with their probabilities for two customer profiles (user class A and user class B).

## 4. Hierarchical Description and Analysis
### 4.1. Service and Function Levels
At the service level, the main services needed to implement each function and their interactions are described. Internal and external services are distinguished. The resource level details the architecture, fault tolerance, and maintenance strategies. Each external service is represented as a black box.

### 4.2. Dependability Evaluation Results
Sensitivity analysis results are presented to show the impact of various assumptions on the user-perceived availability. These include the user operational profile, travel agency architecture, and fault coverage.

## 5. Conclusion
This paper presents a hierarchical modeling framework for the user-perceived dependability of e-business applications, illustrated through a web-based travel agency example. The framework decomposes the application into four levels: user, function, service, and resource. The user-perceived availability measure accounts for both performance-related and traditional failures. Sensitivity analysis results provide valuable insights for service providers in making informed design decisions.
