### Determining the Selection of Cryptographic Mechanisms for Biometric Data Protection

Our objective was to address the shortcomings in biometric security and privacy, emphasizing that these two fields should not be viewed as separate, but rather as interdependent. With the rapid advancement of technology, both internationally and within the European Union, the legal frameworks for protecting biometric data have become more stringent. However, there is a need for further research to ensure that biometric systems meet their primary objectives while respecting privacy policies, especially in scenarios where impersonation and biometric data disclosure are critical.

A significant portion of this thesis focused on enhancing the secrecy and privacy of biometric data, particularly for use in ePassports and identity cards. We conducted a detailed analysis of cryptographic schemes and evaluated their effectiveness in mitigating security gaps. In collaboration with colleagues from the FIDELITY Project, we found that despite the maturity of research in pattern recognition and biometric protection, existing approaches still have vulnerabilities. For instance, encrypting biometric data alone is insufficient to protect against all types of attacks, such as spoofing attacks, as highlighted by Marcel et al. [136]. Therefore, we analyzed the necessity of anti-spoofing techniques to prevent such attacks. Motivated by the rapid evolution of adversaries' tactics, we addressed the vulnerabilities of unimodal and multi-factor schemes under realistic scenarios. Our findings indicated that challenge-response mechanisms can effectively counter spoofing attacks in unimodal schemes, and their application in multimodal architectures enhances robustness.

Consequently, we proposed a biometric authentication framework that combines two modalities and a liveness detection technique to increase security levels. Additionally, our approach involved securely storing biometric data in the chip of the ePassport using biometric cryptosystems and a key-generation method to ensure both security and user privacy. We believe this work will help evaluate the impact of spoofing attacks and contribute to the public acceptance of government biometric-based deployments.

### Remote Biometric Authentication and Privacy-Enhanced Designs

Remote biometric authentication has gained popularity in eFinance and ePayment applications, raising privacy concerns. We demonstrated that pseudonymous biometric identities can result in privacy-enhanced designs. This technique was initially introduced in EU-funded biometric development projects, such as TURBINE [215] and FIDELITY [67]. In our work, we implemented this method in an eFinance model based on the findings of these projects. We evaluated our design according to existing privacy principles and security recommendations, including ISO Standards [92] and the new GDPR [66]. The results showed that our model aligns with ISO recommendations for the security framework in financial services [94]. We also analyzed how the privacy requirements and concepts presented in ISO Standards [95] could be satisfied during technical implementation. We hope that our research will contribute to secure and privacy-preserving biometric-based identity management solutions in financial services.

### Managing Biometric Data in Cloud Environments

The volume of biometric data for recognition purposes has increased rapidly, requiring substantial processing and storage capacity. We analyzed how to manage these challenges in cloud environments and identified privacy risks associated with maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of users' biometric data. We introduced a distributed approach for secure and privacy-preserving multimodal Authentication as a Service (AaaS) in an environment with malicious adversaries. Our design avoided additional re-enrollment phases and auxiliary temporary or permanent storage of biometric data in a Centralized Biometric Database (CBDB) to reduce the risk of inappropriate use of personal information, which can lead to identity tracking and monitoring. The architecture met the criteria outlined in ISO Standards for biometric technologies [96], ensuring user acceptance. Although our approach was designed for authentication, it could also operate in identification mode with minor adjustments. Some limitations, such as the selected biometric modalities, matching techniques, and fusion strategies, may affect complexity and efficiency. Our detailed analysis showed that other options had weaknesses and were inefficient. Our decentralized privacy-preserving protocols can be easily extended to update parameters and adjust different biometrics, classifiers, matching methods, and fusion rules, offering dynamic functionality and flexibility in terms of computation and communication efficiency. Given its potential market value, our approach can provide a cost-effective business model and serve as a framework for future applications, platforms, and systems leveraging existing biometric datasets.

### Conclusion and Future Work

The field of security and privacy in biometric schemes for authentication and identification has received significant attention in recent years. While substantial progress has been made, there is still room for improvement. It is important to note that biometric protection involves more than just applying cryptographic primitives; the practical implementation of privacy-by-design approaches remains challenging. In the age of the Internet of Things, we hope that the results of this thesis will inspire other researchers to design more robust biometric architectures.
