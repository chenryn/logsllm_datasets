### Integration of Models with Different Levels of Abstraction

The integration process is consistent for models that represent the same organizational aspect but differ in their level of abstraction (e.g., process models from different levels of a process hierarchy). It is crucial to recognize that knowledge elements often overlap across different models. Therefore, additional merging rules, which are not part of the ontology, need to be defined. Depending on the intended use of the knowledge base, it may be necessary to extract and map the data back into the specific model structure format. This transformation from a semantically richer model (with relations or properties that specific models do not support) into a specific format requires special consideration.

### Overall System Architecture and Applied Technologies

The system architecture for implementing the integration framework includes the following key components (Figure 2):
1. **Business Process Knowledge Ontology**: Defines the concepts, their properties, and the relationships between them. It serves as a guideline for integrating models and, together with schema files, is used to define mapping files.
2. **Mapping Files Repository**: Contains XSLT standard format files that define the linking between concepts in specific models and those defined in the BPK ontology.
3. **Mapping and Integration Component**: Transforms specific models into RDF/OWL format and integrates them into the knowledge base.
4. **Extraction and Mapping Component**: Manages the extraction of model-specific concepts from the knowledge base and maps them into tool-specific formats.

### Business Process Knowledge Ontology

The business process knowledge ontology defines the concepts, their properties, and the relationships between them. In the framework, it serves multiple purposes:
- **Guideline for Model Integration**: The mapping & integration component uses the ontology to integrate models.
- **Definition of Mapping Files**: Together with schema files, it is used to create mapping files that describe the format structure of the models.

### Mapping Files Repository

The repository consists of XSLT standard format files (W3C 1999) that define the linking between concepts in specific models and those in the BPK ontology. These files must be created separately for each model and for each direction of mapping. The requirement for modeling tools is to export models into a semi-structured data format, such as XML (W3C 2006), which most current tools support. Mapping files can be created manually using XSLT editors or semi-automatically (Cardoso 2007), requiring tool-specific XML schemas (W3C 2004).

### Mapping and Integration Component

Using the mapping files, the mapping & integration component transforms specific models into RDF/OWL (W3C 2004) format and integrates them into the knowledge base. The integration process applies the relations and constraints defined by the ontology. The extraction and mapping component manages the extraction of model-specific concepts from the knowledge base and maps them into tool-specific formats.

### Prototype Tool

The prototype tool under development implements the described architectural design. The BPK ontology was created in OWL Web Ontology Language (W3C 2004) using an iterative approach. The initial version was based on business process meta-models (e.g., List and Korherr 2006) and existing business process and enterprise ontologies (e.g., Jenz 2003, Uschold et al. 1998). In the second phase, the ontology was refined and extended with concepts and properties from specific models, such as XPDL (WFMC 2005).

Currently, the prototype supports the mapping of models representing the functional, organizational, and strategic perspectives of processes and provides basic integration functionality.

### Framework Adaptability

The proposed integration framework is open to extensions and improvements in several ways:
- **Adding New Concepts and Properties**: The BPK ontology can be extended by adding new elements and defining their context with appropriate relations. If the new elements are included in specific models, the corresponding mapping files must be updated.
- **Adding New Specific Models**: For example, organizational resources, which are currently only partially covered, can be added. An appropriate modeling tool must be selected, and bidirectional mapping files must be created. The BPK ontology may need to be upgraded with missing elements.
- **Introducing New Modeling Tools**: The same procedure applies if a new modeling tool is introduced.

### Conclusion and Future Work

Organizations face challenges with heterogeneous, distributed, isolated, and often inaccessible process knowledge. Current modeling approaches and process modeling languages do not fully meet the requirements for business process knowledge management. This paper proposes an adaptive framework for integrating business process knowledge. The novelty lies in its semantic technology support, enabling the mapping and integration of different organizational aspect models into a common knowledge base. This integrated knowledge base can facilitate process knowledge analysis and provide a basis for creating multiple perspectives (personalized views) on the model.

Future work includes completing the current framework prototype implementation and conducting industry case studies in participating organizations. Special research focus will be on developing automatic integration rules.
