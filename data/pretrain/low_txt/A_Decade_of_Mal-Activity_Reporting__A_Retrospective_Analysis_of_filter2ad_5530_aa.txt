## Abstract
This paper examines the reporting of Internet malicious activity (or "mal-activity") by public blacklists, with the aim of providing a systematic characterization of reported activities and their evolution over time. Using an initial seed of 22 blacklists covering the period from January 2007 to June 2017, we collected over 51 million mal-activity reports involving 662,000 unique IP addresses worldwide. Leveraging the Wayback Machine, antivirus (AV) tool reports, and additional public datasets (e.g., BGP Route Views and Internet registries), we enriched the data with historical meta-information, including geolocations, autonomous system (AS) numbers, and types of mal-activity. We used an initially labeled dataset of approximately 1.57 million mal-activities to train a machine learning classifier, which we then applied to classify the remaining 44 million unlabeled mal-activities. Our unique collected dataset and scripts are publicly available for further research.

The main contributions of this paper include a novel means of report collection, a machine learning approach to classify reported activities, a detailed characterization of the dataset, and, most importantly, a temporal analysis of mal-activity reporting behavior. Inspired by peer-to-peer (P2P) behavior modeling, our analysis reveals that certain classes of mal-activities (e.g., phishing) and a small number of mal-activity sources are persistent, suggesting either the ineffectiveness of blacklist-based prevention systems or unreasonably long update periods. Our findings also indicate that resources can be better utilized by focusing on heavy mal-activity contributors, which constitute the bulk of malicious activities.

## 1 Introduction
Public reports of malicious online activity are commonly used in the form of blacklists by intrusion detection systems, spam filters, and similar tools to identify hosts known for suspicious activity. However, little is known about the dynamics of these reports. Understanding what has been reported and how the reported activity evolves over time is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of blacklist-based threat prevention systems. This paper conducts a longitudinal measurement study of malicious online activity (abridged as "mal-activity") reports over a ten-year period (January 2007 to June 2017). We define a mal-activity as any activity reported by one or more public data sources, particularly within blacklists. The actor or entity behind each mal-activity can be reduced to a combination of IP address, autonomous system (AS) in which the reported IP address resides, or the country in which the IP address is located, which we call "malicious hosts."

We collected 51.6 million mal-activity reports involving 662,000 unique IP addresses worldwide. Using the Internet Wayback Machine, reports from antivirus (AV) tools, and several additional datasets, we obtained historical meta-information such as geolocation and AS numbers. We categorized the combined mal-activities into six classes: Malware, Phishing, Fraudulent Services (FS), Spamming, Exploits, and Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs). The collected dataset encompasses attributes and historical knowledge of numerous malicious hosts from these six classes, providing a wide range of possible mal-activities. To foster further research, we release the dataset and scripts used in this paper to the research community: https://internetmaliciousactivity.github.io/

The main contributions of our work are:
- A machine learning approach to label the entire dataset (51.6 million mal-activities) by training a classifier on 1.57 million labeled reports.
- An ensemble of Random Forest classifiers trained on basic report information, achieving an accuracy of 93.5% in re-identifying the type of mal-activity.
- Insights into the prevalence and distribution of different mal-activity classes, with malware being the most prevalent and phishing showing increasing reports.
- Analysis of the hosting infrastructure and geographic concentration of mal-activities, revealing that the US and China host the majority of malicious activities.
- Temporal analysis of mal-activity reporting, highlighting the persistence of certain classes and the need for more frequent updates in blacklist systems.
- Identification of heavy mal-activity contributors, suggesting that tracking these entities should be a priority for law enforcement and network providers.

## 2 Data Collection
### 2.1 The Seed Dataset: Blacklist-07-17
We initiated the collection of the seed dataset by manually identifying 22 publicly available blacklists that report a wide range of mal-activities. These blacklists were augmented using the Internet Wayback Machine to obtain historical versions spanning from January 2007 to June 2017, resulting in over 2 million timestamped reports of 297,095 unique IP addresses. The exact differences and basic statistics of Blacklist-07-17 are summarized in Appendix A.1 and Table 5.

### 2.2 The Reported Activities Dataset: VTBlacklist
To extend the seed dataset, we queried VirusTotal (VT), a publicly available aggregator of antivirus (AV) products, for additional reports. VT provides scan results from 67 different AV products and has been widely used in academic literature to detect malicious apps, executables, software, and domains. We used the VT report API to query for domains and IP addresses, obtaining associated aggregated reports from different AV products. This process identified additional IP addresses and generated a list of 662,289 unique IP addresses corresponding to 51,645,995 reported malicious activities, collectively called VTBlacklist.

### 2.3 The Augmented Dataset: FinalBlacklist
We enriched the VTBlacklist dataset with historical metadata, including AS numbers and geolocation information, using the BGP Route Views dataset. This augmentation provided a comprehensive set of attributes, consistent with the timestamp of the reports, resulting in the FinalBlacklist dataset.

## 3 and 4 Analysis of Mal-Activity Reporting Behavior
### 3.1 Classification and Labeling
We used a machine learning approach to label the entire dataset, achieving high accuracy in re-identifying the type of mal-activity. The trained model was then used to predict the mal-activity type of reports that lacked this information.

### 3.2 Geographical and Hosting Infrastructure Analysis
Our analysis revealed that malware is the most prevalent class, with a diverse set of hosting infrastructures and geolocations. The US and China were found to be the primary hosts of malicious activities, while countries like the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla had a disproportionately large number of malicious IPs, often dominated by singular ASes.

### 3.3 Temporal Analysis
We observed that malware has historically been the dominant class, but phishing activities have steadily risen since 2012, becoming the second largest class in volume. We also analyzed the periods of "activity" and "inactivity" of hosts, modeled by an alternating renewal process, to capture churn rates and resiliency to reporting. Phishing activities were found to be the most resilient, with quick recovery from potential shutdowns.

### 3.4 Recurrence and Magnitude
We analyzed the recurrence rate of mal-activities, finding that countries such as Colombia, Panama, Bahamas, Norway, and Mexico had the highest rates. Additionally, we measured the magnitude of reported mal-activities, showing that a small number of IP addresses (approximately 200) were involved in a massive number of malicious activities per week.
