### Summary of System Log Chunk

This system log chunk, spanning from 18:06:43 to 18:06:48 on October 18, documents several recurring issues and attempts to resolve them within a Hadoop environment. The key points are as follows:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures:**
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component (process ID: `msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`) repeatedly fails to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
   - Each failure is logged with an increasing duration, starting at 105 seconds and incrementing by one second in each subsequent log entry.
   - The system indicates that it will retry the lease renewal shortly after each failure.

2. **Address Change Detection:**
   - Multiple address changes are detected for both the `LeaseRenewer` and the `RMCommunicator Allocator` components.
   - The old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` and the new address is `msra-sa-41:9000` for the `LeaseRenewer`.
   - For the `RMCommunicator Allocator`, the old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` and the new address is `msra-sa-41:8030`.

3. **Connection Attempts to ResourceManager (RM):**
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` component (process ID: `msra-sa-41:8030`) attempts to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - Each attempt is followed by an error message indicating a failure to contact the ResourceManager (RM).
   - The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a fixed sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between each retry.

### Conclusion
The log entries indicate ongoing issues with address changes and failures in both lease renewal and connection attempts to the ResourceManager. The system is configured to retry these operations, but the repeated failures suggest a persistent problem that may require further investigation.
