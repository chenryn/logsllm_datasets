### Foreword

The world of technology has grown increasingly complex over the last couple of decades, particularly since the rise of the internet. Many products promise to tame this complexity, but often they add more layers of complexity themselves. In 2012, Ansible was released, and by 2013, it was gaining significant traction. Its promise of power through simplicity resonated with early adopters, who saw it as a people-pleasing game changer.

I first met James at one of his technical Ansible talks a few years ago. It was still relatively early days for Ansible, although we had just been acquired by Red Hat. At that meeting, I realized that James understood the link between people and Ansible's powerful simplicity. I've been fortunate enough to see James speak on several occasions, including a memorable talk at AnsibleFest 2018 in Austin, Texas, where he discussed a business-critical database upgrade on a Friday afternoon. Another standout presentation was at an Ansible London meetup, where James presented a tale of positive psychology, sparking lively interaction during the Q&A session.

Scalability isn't just about technology; it's about people. If a technology is to scale, it must be easy for people to adopt, master, and share. James is a model of scalability himself, as he readily shares his knowledge. In this book, he shows that Ansible is an orchestrator, a conductor of the symphony, with the ability to span an enterprise. I'm sure you'll enjoy reading it as much as I've enjoyed every interaction with James.
