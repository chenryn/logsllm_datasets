### 7. Discussion on Instantaneous FA Suppression

The overall effectiveness of opportunistic voting in suppressing false alarms (FAs) is 72%, which is encouraging but may not be sufficient for operational use. However, combining voting tallies with historical (non-instantaneous) evidence can significantly improve accuracy.

1. **Short FA Periods:**
   - Many successful FA periods are relatively short. An operational detector could be configured to ignore FAs that persist for less than a minimum duration, such as 30 seconds.
   - This would increase detection latency from the onset of a true wormhole attack but could be justified if short-duration attacks are deemed minor threats or too difficult to distinguish from general MANET "noise."

2. **Link History:**
   - A normal link is unlikely to transform into a wormhole (or vice versa). Therefore, a link's prior or subsequent history can be considered.
   - If 95% of a link's lifetime has been free of successful accusations, the 5% during which the link has been accused should be evaluated with skepticism.

3. **Voting History:**
   - Nodes whose accusatory votes often differ from the majority could be given less weight in future voting tallies.
   - This would force attackers to be more selective in using false accusations, as failure in initial voting tallies would reduce their chances of success in the future.

### Surprising Result: Correlation with Node Degree

Interestingly, the effectiveness of opportunistic voting in suppressing FAs does not strongly correlate with the average node degree. This is counter-intuitive because having a larger population of honest nodes in the neighborhood surrounding a falsely accused link would seem to increase the likelihood that two colluding attackers would be outvoted.

### Factors Affecting Voting Effectiveness

1. **Network Topology:**
   - The topology must allow the accused nodes to have a sufficient number of disjoint honest neighbors. For example, if node A in Figure 3 moves to the right and becomes a neighbor of both B and C, it would no longer be able to send 3-hop probes to D via link BC. D would become two hops from A and would cease being a destination for A’s 3-hop probes. Moreover, even if A sent probes to D, they would pass only through C, skipping B. Thus, despite A’s proximity, it would no longer be able to probe or vote for link BC.

2. **Path Selection:**
   - Between a pair of nodes that are 3 hops apart, there may be several alternate paths available. OLSR will arbitrarily choose one of these paths.
   - If OLSR chooses the path through the falsely accused link, the pair of nodes can probe the path and vote in favor of the accused link. However, if OLSR chooses a different path, the pair will be able to vote on some other link’s innocence but not the falsely accused link.
   - Increasing the density in the vicinity of a victim link may increase the potential number of paths through which observers may probe an accused link, but the actual number is determined by OLSR.

### Test Case Construction

Constructing good test cases that utilize random mobility models is challenging due to the dependence of in-band wormhole attack and false accusation effectiveness on attacker spacing. The amount of interesting FA data generated during test runs was strongly correlated with network density. This likely resulted from using identical geographic spacing for the attackers in all runs. The spacing was chosen so that the pair of attackers on each side of the topology would be 3 hops apart during most of the 48-node test runs. Keeping this spacing constant minimized the number of experimental variables that might affect run outcomes.

At lower network densities, there is less chance that two intermediary nodes will be close to the "line-of-sight" between a pair of attackers. If the two closest intermediaries are too far from this line, they will not be able to bridge a path between two attackers without additional intermediaries, increasing the hop count between the attackers. Consequently, at lower network densities, the length of a path between a pair of attackers is more likely to be greater than 3 hops, reducing the frequency of corroborating false accusations. In hindsight, adjusting (reducing) the attacker spacing for lower densities or extending run durations for lower density test runs might have been better.

### Simplifying Assumption

A simplifying assumption listed in Section 4.1 is that measurements can be reliably communicated to one or more correlation nodes. This sidesteps the fundamental issue of Byzantine agreement in distributed systems, where communications between nodes often depend on correct forwarding by intermediary nodes, which may be malicious. Instead, we focus on whether the totality of data distributed throughout the network is adequate to enable a correct consensus. This paper provides partial evidence that the data produced by our prototype (3-hop path measurements) is adequate for correct wormhole detection decisions, even in the presence of colluding attackers and false accusations. However, practical implementation will require reaching consensus when communications depend on forwarding by potentially malicious intermediary nodes.

### 8. Conclusion

Detecting attacks on MANET routing and forwarding requires cooperative detection techniques that use ordinary, relatively vulnerable hosts as intrusion sensors. If compromised, these hosts can inject bogus data into the intrusion detection system to conceal malicious activities or falsely accuse well-behaved nodes. Voting-based approaches to Byzantine fault tolerance are potentially applicable but must address the fact that only nodes in particular topological locations at a particular time can observe the symptoms of a particular attack and are therefore eligible to vote on whether an attack occurred.

We examined this issue in the context of a prototype distributed detector for self-contained, in-band wormholes in an OLSR network, focusing on false accusations. The detector analyzes roundtrip delay measurements of 3-hop paths and correlates these to identify the locations of wormhole links and thus the attackers. The detector was tested using specialized wormhole attack software that reports bogus delay measurements to conceal its presence and falsely accuse nearby nodes. Additionally, this software manipulates delay measurements reported by other nodes so that they are tricked into falsely accusing their neighbors.

We tested the prototype detector in a 48-node wireless emulation testbed employing random node mobility to facilitate corroboration of false accusations. We conducted 12 hour-long tests using four network densities and three random initialization seeds. The results show that during 13,481 link-seconds of corroborated false accusations, opportunistic voting instantaneously suppressed 72% of the accusations. Most periods of successful false accusations were relatively brief, e.g., less than 30 seconds, suggesting that most unsuppressed accusations could be ignored safely at the cost of increased detection latency. Significantly greater accuracy appears achievable by combining instantaneous voting with statistics from each link’s prior history; if a link’s lifetime has been primarily free of successful accusations, a small period of successful accusations against it should be treated with skepticism. For the network densities tested, the effectiveness of voting in suppressing false accusations was only loosely correlated with average node degree.

Future work will include treating false accusations as another intrusion symptom that can be used to identify attackers. This may be complex because attackers can trick other nodes into generating false accusations and may do so probabilistically to remain stealthy. We have recently begun using game-theoretic techniques to analyze such interplay between wormhole countermeasures and counter-countermeasures. These techniques should enable the formulation of mathematically-based strategies that optimize intrusion detection and response system effectiveness.
