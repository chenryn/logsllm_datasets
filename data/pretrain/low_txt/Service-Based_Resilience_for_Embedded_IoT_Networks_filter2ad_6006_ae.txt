## Discussion
The complexity of the problem was analyzed based on the MILP formulation, which highlighted scalability issues. We found that the number of demands is the most significant factor affecting solution time. To address this, we proposed heuristics to reduce the problem size and find near-optimal greedy solutions. Experiments showed a tradeoff between optimal QoS and resilience, with our heuristics providing well-balanced solutions more than 10^6 times faster than the MILP solution.

Given the problem's complexity, we limited failure scenarios to single node failures. While single random failures are common in networks and distributed systems, more structured massive node failures due to software crashes, vulnerabilities, or cyber-attacks are also real threats in embedded IoT networks. Future work will consider these scenarios in alternative topologies that reflect domain-specific network characteristics.
