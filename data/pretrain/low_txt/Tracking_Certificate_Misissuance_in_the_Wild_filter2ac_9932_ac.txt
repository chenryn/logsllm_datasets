### OCSP and CRL Timeouts and Response Times

**Figure 7: OCSP, CRL Timeouts, and Average Time to Respond**

- **(a) OCSP and CRL Responder Timeout CDF**
- **(b) OCSP and CRL Average Time to Respond CDF**

In Figure 7, we present the average response times and the number of timeouts for OCSP responders and CRL distribution points found in certificates within our dataset. While most organizations adhere to community standards, a few poorly managed and broken services are still encoded in trusted certificates.

#### Key Observations:
- **Response Times**: The median response time is 247 milliseconds.
- **Timeouts**: 
  - 75% of responders (associated with 89.8% of intermediates and 94.2% of organizations) were available for all 454 checks during our two-week measurement period.
  - 9% of responders (134) were offline for all checks, belonging to 73 organizations.
  - 2 responders had median response times above 10 seconds, both belonging to WISeKey.
  - 53 responders had worst-case response times greater than 10 seconds.

### Misissuance and Intermediate Certificates

We found that in 80% of the organizations, the majority of ZLint error certificates can be traced back to a single intermediate. For example, COMODO RSA Domain Validation Secure Server accounts for 85.5% of COMODO's misissued certificates. This suggests that intermediates within an organization may use different codebases or infrastructure, leading to increased maintenance complexity and potential for errors.

### Beyond Individual Certificates

While ZLint can systematically identify issues in individual certificates, many aspects of CA operations, such as domain ownership validation and consistent OCSP responses, cannot be verified in isolation. We measured two supporting services—OCSP responders and CRL distribution points—to see if they correlate with certificate misissuance.

#### A. OCSP Responders

OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) allows authorities to revoke issued certificates. According to BR §4.9, authorities must continually operate OCSP responders. Our checks included:

1. **Endpoint Availability**: Authorities must maintain an online OCSP responder (BR §4.9.10). We checked for baseline responsiveness every hour using a 60-second timeout.
2. **Regular Updates**: OCSP responders must update revocation responses at least once every four days (BR §4.9.10).
3. **No Response for Unknown Certificates**: Authorities must not return a "GOOD" response for certificates they did not issue. We tested this by sending an OCSP request for a non-issued serial number.

We performed these checks for 1,419 responders from September 1–20, 2017, at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus.

**Results**:
- 75% of responders (89.8% of intermediates and 94.2% of organizations) were available for all 454 checks.
- 9% of responders (134) were offline for all checks, belonging to 73 organizations.
- 25 responders (11 organizations) incorrectly provided a "GOOD" response for unknown certificates.
- 10 responders (7 organizations) did not refresh validity periods every four days.

#### B. CRL Maintenance

CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) are another mechanism for revoking certificates. Per BR §4.10, CAs must guarantee the uptime of CRL distribution points. Our dataset includes 3.4K unique CRLs, associated with 90% of intermediates and 95% of organizations.

**Results**:
- 6 servers (0.2%) timed out for every request.
- The median response time is 252 milliseconds, well under the 10-second requirement.
- 2 CRL distribution points had worst-case response times of 15 seconds.
- Smaller organizations, issuing a median of 37 certificates, generally have worse CRL performance.

### Misissuance as a Predictor

Adhering to technical standards is crucial for correct behavior with user agents. We also explored whether ZLint-detected misissuance can predict more severe problems like incorrect domain ownership validation.

**Findings**:
- Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox removed three certificate authorities (WoSign, Symantec, and PROCERT) due to various issues.
- These issuers had some of the highest ZLint misissuance rates.
- There is a strong correlation (Point-Biserial Correlation = 0.71, p = 0.002) between organization misissuance rate and browser action for large authorities with over 100K certificates.
- However, there is no correlation for very small authorities who misissue all their certificates.

### Community Discussion of Misissuance

We investigated the correlation between mismanagement and misissuance with discussions on the Mozilla Developer Security Policy (MDSP) mailing list, a primary public forum for web PKI issues.

**Results**:
- Weak correlation between ZLint errors and MDSP discussion of misissuance.
- Strong positive correlation (0.88, p << 0.01) for larger organizations.
- Discussion is skewed towards misissuance rather than management of other resources like CRLs and OCSP.

### Discussion and Recommendations

The PKI community should use lint results along with other data sources to identify authorities with worrisome operational practices. We recommend:

- **Independent, Long-Term Data Collection and Reporting**: Additional monitors and better reporting tools are needed to track CA behavior over time.
- **Focus on Small Authorities**: Many small authorities struggle to follow community standards and correctly issue valid certificates. They deserve additional attention.
- **Lack of Authority Transparency**: Improve the CCADB to include explicit information about intermediate operators.
- **Community Response**: Use lint data to focus attention on authorities with sustained misissuance, rather than just addressing individual incidents.

### Related Work

Our understanding of the certificate ecosystem has been informed by active probing and Internet-wide scanning. Previous studies have focused on various aspects of HTTPS and PKI, including certificate conformance, revocation, and adoption. Our work builds on these efforts and provides an updated analysis of the ecosystem in 2017, along with the release of ZLint as an open-source project.
