# Hacking DOCSIS for Fun and Profit
## Introduction
- **Presentation Link**: [Hacking DOCSIS for Fun and Profit](http://www.soldierx.com/defcon18/hacking_docsis_for_fun_and_profit-blake_bitemytaco.ppt)
- **Humor**: Perhaps Ted Stevens has a series of hacked modems and a drop amp at his place. Could this be the reason he thinks the internet is a series of tubes?

## Background
- **Personal**:
  - I currently conduct research for S2ERC (Security and Software Engineering Research Center), an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center.
  - Bitemytaco is one of the root administrators at SBHacker ([sbhacker.net](http://www.sbhacker.net)).
- **Previous Speech**:
  - At Defcon 16, we covered DOCSIS 2.0 and below with devDelay.
  - Our previous speech led to many individuals visiting SBHacker to discuss modem technology, including employees from various ISPs.

## What This Speech Will Cover
- **Requirements** (for our examples)
- **Previous Speech Overview**
  - Anonymous access
  - Cloning HFC MAC linked to an ISP account
  - How anonymous you really are

    - USB Cypress or FTDI based SPI/JTAG (Fast)
    - SPI/Parallel JTAG buffered (Slow)
- **Cable Modem Models**:
  - SB6120/SBV6220/DPC3000
  - Other modems can be modified
- **Soldering Skills**
  - YouTube is an excellent resource for soldering tutorials
  - Solder wires directly to the SPI flash chip
- **Applications for Flashing Firmware**:

  - SPI Programmer

## Hardware and Software Vulnerabilities
- **Hardware (Blame the Manufacturers)**
  - No physical security
  - Common hardware components
- **Software (Blame the Developers)**
  - Initial hacks involved netboot/etherboot, enabling built-in factory mode (implemented by the OS and enabled by setting an SNMP OID), or using stock (noisy) bootloaders.
  - Diagnostic firmware does the job, but better firmware with custom features is easy to create
- **ISP (Blame the Administrators)**
  - Improperly configured CMTS
  - Security flaws in CMTS IOS
  - Costs & Convenience

## Why Hacking Modems is Possible?
- **Cable Network Overview**

## Anonymous Internet Access
- **Example with Comcast**
  - Comcast is the second most used ISP in the United States and the number one ISP using DOCSIS.
  - If you connect a non-provisioned modem to the Comcast network, only a Comcast sign-up page appears.
  - You can generally connect inbound to the computer hooked up to the modem but not outbound.
  - Changing DNS servers can sometimes allow outbound connections. Forcing a configuration file can increase the service class for a non-provisioned modem.
  - Disabling SNMP filters in the console removes port blocking at the modem level and allows polling other modems for useful information on ISPs that allow SNMP polling through the entire HFC network.

## Faster Speeds
- **Anonymous access is good, but faster anonymous access is better.**
  - Increase speeds by forcing a faster configuration file from the ISP, served locally or from configs stored in flash memory.
  - Example configuration files used by Comcast:
    - **DOCSIS 1.0**:
      - `d10_m_sb5100_speedtierextreme2_c05.cm` = 16/2
      - `d10_m_sb5100_showcase_c01.cm` = 55/5
      - `d10_m_na_c05.cm` = 0/0 (unrestricted)
    - **DOCSIS 1.1**:
      - `d11_m_sb5100_speedtierextreme2_c05.cm` = 16/2
      - `d11_m_sb5100_showcase_c01.cm` = 55/5
      - `d11_m_na_c05.cm` = 0/0 (unrestricted)

## Changing the Configuration File
- **Navigate to**: http://192.168.100.1:1337
- **Example**: From Haxorware on the SB5101

## Techniques for Remaining Anonymous
- **Disable the SNMP daemon after registration**:
  - `cd /non-vol/snmp`
  - `diag_disable_post_reg true`
  - `write`
- **Hide the Modem’s HFC IP Address** (You cannot hide CPE IP addresses):
  - `cd /non-vol/snmp`
  - `hide_ipstack_ifentries true`
  - `write`
- **Hide Reported Software Version (system OID)**:
  - `cd /snmp`
  - `delete sysDescr`
  - `write`
- **Hardcode settings into firmware** for desired results submitted to the CMTS.

## Cloning
- **Basic Cloning** involves specifying a provisioned HFC MAC address to get a class of service assigned to the MAC.
- **Due to the broadcast nature of the network**, use a HFC MAC address from a different CMTS.
- **This method** allows you to force any config file but associates your modem with someone else’s account.

## Obtaining Information for Cloning
- **MAC addresses** are traded privately on forums and IRC.
- **Finding HFC MAC addresses** on your node can be done by sniffing DHCP packets sent from the CMTS to all modems.
- **Wireshark** can filter out broadcasted packets to easily assemble a list of HFC MACs on a user’s node.
- **SNMP scanning** is the preferred method for obtaining HFC MACs for multiple nodes with ISPs that allow it.
- **Exact clones** can be used by obtaining all identifying information from the modem, including the HFC MAC, ETHER MAC, USB MAC, Serial, and all BPI+ Certificates.
- **Exact clones** are usually non-provisioned modems; the collective information allows the modem to pass initial authentication checks and gain network access. A faster config file would be forced to bypass the ISP-assigned non-provisioned config with limited service class.

## How Anonymous Are You?
- **Operations Support System** normally cannot pinpoint a modem to an exact location due to the design of the hybrid fiber coax cable network.
- **Detection** usually goes as far as the node where the modem is located.

### Additional Precautions
- **Signal Levels**: Some ISPs poll for poor signal levels. Technicians would disconnect each line to find the source of the signal loss. Use an amp if your signal strength is too low (e.g., BDA-S1 Broadband Drop Amp from Motorola).
- **Routine Audits**: Many ISPs perform routine audits on lines that should not be connected.
- **Regional Operating Centers (ROC)**: Some ISPs have adopted ROCs, which maintain a customer MAC database.

## Precautions to Take
- **Do not transfer personal information over unencrypted connections**.
- **Watch out for law enforcement**.
- **Pay for service on one modem and have another one hooked up for anonymous internet**.
- **Be careful with which HFC MAC addresses you clone**.
- **Remove line identifiers** to assist in anonymity, especially at apartment complexes.

  - Upload, flash, and upgrade firmware

## DOCSIS 3.0
- **Overview**:
  - Essentially DOCSIS 2.0 with channel bonding, native IPv6 support, and enhanced security and encryption features.
  - **Channel Bonding**:
    - Minimum requirement of 4 bonded channels for both downstream and upstream on modems and CMTS.
    - Maximum speeds for a modem in 4x4 config are approximately 160mbps downstream and 120 mbps upstream (EuroDOCSIS 3.0 uses 8mhz wide DS channels instead of 6mhz and supports about 200mbps downstream in 4x4 configuration).
    - The specification does not limit the number of bonded channels, so the speed possibilities are endless (e.g., current 8x4 offerings support over 320mbps downstream).
  - **Chipsets**:
    - **Puma5 chip**: 4 DS + 4 US channels, ARMv6 arch, runs on Linux
    - **Bcm3380**: 8 DS + 4 US channels, MIPS arch, runs on eCos

## DOCSIS 3.0 Modems

  - 50/10 residential and 100/10 business packages. Hacked SB6120s can achieve 120mbps downstream and 15mbps upstream.
- **Charter**:
  - 60/5 residential with 100/10 and 75/5 business packages coming soon.
- **Cablevision/OOL**:
  - 101 mbps download
- **Time Warner/Road Runner**:
  - D3 in New York City only, nationwide rollout soon.
- **Europe**:
  - Some European cable companies offer 8-channel bonded deployments with downstream speeds in the 150-300 mbps range.

## Packetcable: How VOIP Got Owned
- **Cablehack.net**:
  - **Tom Swingler (Mastadogg)**:
    - Arrested in early 2008.
    - First major FBI bust of a cable modem hacker, received heavy media attention.
    - Snitched on by Dshocker.
    - Case dismissed after 6 months without official reason.
    - Snitched on MassModz.
- **TCNiSO.net**:
  - **DerEngel**:
    - Arrested October 2009.
    - Regarded as the “godfather” of cable modem hacking.
    - Snitched on by Dshocker.
    - Currently out on bond awaiting trial.

## United States vs. Modem Hackers – Criminal Cases
- **MassModz.com**:
  - **Matthew Delorey**:
    - Arrested February 2010.
    - Blatantly advertised pre-configured modems to steal service from Comcast.
    - Raided after being snitched on by Mastadogg.
    - Expected to plead guilty.
- **Various Small Busts**:
  - Mostly located in South Florida where theft of service is rampant.
  - All current arrests involve theft of service. Using modems for diagnostic purposes is still legal. Most arrests have been due to informants.

## STOP SNITCHING
- **Haxorware and sbh alpha (unnamed)**:
  - Still the leading firmware, likely to continue for some time.
  - Community of over 66,000 users at SBhacker.net.
- **Haxomatic**:
  - Hardware and software to flash newer modems.
- **Miscellaneous Tools**:
  - Rajkosto at [haxorware.com/6120stuff.html](http://haxorware.com/6120stuff.html)
  - Usbjtag.exe by usbjtag
  - Tom’s jtag utility

## New Tools and Firmware
- **Concerns**:
  - With the extremely high bandwidth of D3 modems, there is a big concern about users being targeted for botnets.
  - Previous upstream was 256kbps to 2mbps; D3 average is 5-10mbps and increasing.
  - Law enforcement may continue to crack down on modem hackers following recent arrests.

## The Future
- **Perspectives: Role Playing**
  - **Customers**:
    - Protect and respect our privacy.
    - Provide quality, unlimited service.
    - Stop charging more when you’ve failed.
  - **Hackers**:
    - Demand anonymous internet access.
    - You make it so easy, it seems intentional.
    - Not my fault the network is not configured properly.
    - You will still have a problem.
  - **ISPs**:
    - We should probably just lie.
    - Let’s cut corners to save money.
    - Unlimited user bandwidth is bad (Customer monthly throughput < Profit).
    - You can’t do that on the Internets!
    - Your information is being sold to the highest bidder.

### Problems and Solutions
- **BPI+**:
  - Crack 56bit DES or X.509 v3 RSA? (time, money, and more time).
  - Corporate espionage.
  - Self-signed certificates.
  - Reverse current bpimanager & built-in self-signing functions.
- **Cloning Detection**:
  - Exact/perfect clones can usually bypass detection.
  - Network access can be gained on most ISPs as long as authentication is passed.
  - If you still can’t force a config to get network access, firmware modification is usually the answer.
  - The situation for ISPs preventing unauthorized access looks bleak for several reasons.
