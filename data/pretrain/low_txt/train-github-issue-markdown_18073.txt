### Issue with SelectField Scrolling to First Item When Checking Last or Near-Last Items

**Description:**
I am experiencing an issue with the `SelectField` component, where the list scrolls to the first item immediately after clicking on the last item or items near the bottom. This behavior is particularly noticeable when the first menu item contains buttons as children.

**Expected Behavior:**
The list should remain at the same position where the user clicked, without scrolling to the first item. The selected item should be checked, and the scroll position should not change.

**Current Behavior:**
When the user clicks on the last item or items near the bottom of the list, the list automatically scrolls to the first item. This disrupts the user experience and makes it difficult to verify if the correct item was selected.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Click on the `SelectField`.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the list.
3. Click on any item near the bottom.
4. The list will scroll to the top, instead of staying in place.

**Context:**
This issue significantly impacts the usability of my dropdown component. It forces users to re-scroll to the bottom to verify if they have correctly selected the intended item. The presence of buttons in the first menu item is necessary for the functionality of the component.

**Environment:**
- **Material-UI:** 0.19.4
- **React:** 16.0.0
- **Browser:** Google Chrome
- **Operating System:** Windows 10

**Additional Notes:**
- I have searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
- Any help in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.
