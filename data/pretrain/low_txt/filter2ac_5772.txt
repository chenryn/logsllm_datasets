### Title: Blackhat Asia-19: Office in Wonderland

In this talk, we will delve into a variety of innovative techniques that exploit Microsoft Office features for offensive purposes. We will unveil new vulnerabilities in Word and Excel, present attack vectors that Microsoft classifies as features, and demonstrate the security implications of the MS Office suite's architectural design. Join us on a journey down the rabbit hole, where we will reveal unexpected and offensive surprises.

In our previous research, we demonstrated that abusing legacy functionalities—such as macro languages predating VBA—can bypass many existing security controls. In this presentation, we will expand on these findings and share our most recent discoveries and insights into unexplored legacy functionalities within the MS Office suite that can be exploited at all stages of an attack. 

Among other topics, we will demonstrate:
- How to use Word documents to steal sensitive information from systems.
- Techniques for creating phishing documents to harvest credentials without relying on macro payloads.
- Methods to bypass the latest security features in MS Office, including AMSI for VBA and ASR.
- And much more.

Join us for an in-depth exploration of the hidden dangers and offensive capabilities within the MS Office suite.
