Many federal agencies have already begun identifying their enterprise assets. Agencies that have established Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program capabilities, such as Hardware Asset Management (HWAM) and Software Asset Management (SWAM), have a rich set of data to draw from when implementing a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA). Additionally, these agencies may have identified High Value Assets (HVAs) [M-19-03] that are critical to their mission. This foundational work must be in place across the entire enterprise or agency before any business process can be (re)designed with ZTA. These programs must be designed to be scalable and adaptable to changes in the enterprise, not only during the migration to ZTA but also as new assets, services, and business processes are added.

#### 7.3.3 Identify Key Processes and Evaluate Risks Associated with Executing Process

The third inventory an agency should undertake is to identify and rank business processes, data flows, and their relevance to the agency's mission. Business processes should inform the circumstances under which resource access requests are granted or denied. An organization may wish to start with a low-risk business process for the initial transition to ZTA, as disruptions are less likely to negatively impact the entire organization. As experience is gained, more critical business processes can be considered.

Business processes that utilize cloud-based resources or are used by remote workers are often good candidates for ZTA, as they can see improvements in availability and security. Instead of extending the enterprise perimeter into the cloud or bringing clients into the enterprise network via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), enterprise clients can request cloud services directly. The enterprise’s Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs) ensure that enterprise policies are followed before granting resource access to a client. Planners should also consider potential trade-offs in performance, user experience, and increased workflow fragility that may occur when implementing ZTA for a given business process.

#### 7.3.4 Formulating Policies for the ZTA Candidate

Identifying a candidate service or business workflow depends on several factors: the importance of the process to the organization, the group of subjects affected, and the current state of resources used for the workflow. The value of the asset or workflow based on risk can be evaluated using the NIST Risk Management Framework [SP800-37].

After the asset or workflow is identified, all upstream resources (e.g., ID management systems, databases, micro-services), downstream resources (e.g., logging, security monitoring), and entities (e.g., subjects, service accounts) that are used or affected by the workflow should be identified. This may influence the choice of the first migration to ZTA. An application/service used by a specific subset of enterprise subjects (e.g., a purchasing system) may be preferred over one that is vital to the entire subject base of the enterprise (e.g., email).

Enterprise administrators then need to determine the set of criteria (if using a criteria-based Trust Algorithm) or confidence level weights (if using a score-based Trust Algorithm) for the resources used in the candidate business process (see Section 3.3.1). These criteria or values may need to be adjusted during the tuning phase to ensure that policies are effective without hindering access to resources.

#### 7.3.5 Identifying Candidate Solutions

Once a list of candidate business processes has been developed, enterprise architects can compile a list of candidate solutions. Some deployment models (see Section 3.1) are better suited to particular workflows and current enterprise ecosystems. Similarly, some vendor solutions are better suited to certain use cases than others. Consider the following factors:

- **Client Asset Installation:** Does the solution require components to be installed on the client asset? This may limit business processes where non-enterprise-owned assets are used or desired, such as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) or cross-agency collaborations.
- **On-Premises vs. Cloud:** Does the solution work where the business process resources exist entirely on enterprise premises? Some solutions assume that requested resources will reside in the cloud (north-south traffic) and not within an enterprise perimeter (east-west traffic).
- **Logging and Analysis:** Does the solution provide a means to log interactions for analysis? A key component of ZT is the collection and use of data related to the process flow that feeds back into the Policy Engine (PE) for making access decisions.
- **Support for Applications and Protocols:** Does the solution support a broad range of applications, services, and protocols? Some solutions may support a wide range of protocols (web, SSH, etc.) and transports (IPv4 and IPv6), while others may only work with a narrow focus such as web or email.
- **Subject Behavior Changes:** Does the solution require changes to subject behavior? Some solutions may require additional steps to perform a given workflow, potentially changing how enterprise subjects perform the workflow.

One approach is to model an existing business process as a pilot program rather than a full replacement. This pilot can be general to apply to several business processes or specific to one use case. The pilot can serve as a "proving ground" for ZTA before transitioning subjects to the ZTA deployment and away from the legacy process infrastructure.

#### 7.3.6 Initial Deployment and Monitoring

Once the candidate workflow and ZTA components are chosen, the initial deployment can begin. Enterprise administrators must implement the developed policies using the selected components but may initially operate in an observation and monitoring mode. Few enterprise policy sets are complete in their first iterations; important user accounts (e.g., administrator accounts) may be denied access to necessary resources or may have more access privileges than needed.

The new ZT business workflow could be operated in reporting-only mode for some time to ensure that the policies are effective and workable. This allows the enterprise to understand baseline asset and resource access requests, behavior, and communication patterns. Reporting-only mode means that access should be granted for most requests, and logs and traces of connections should be compared with the initial developed policy. Basic policies, such as denying requests that fail Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or appear from known, attacker-controlled IP addresses, should be enforced and logged. After initial deployment, access policies should be more lenient to collect data from actual interactions of the ZT workflow. Once the baseline activity patterns for the workflow are established, anomalous behavior can be more easily identified. If it is not possible to operate in a more lenient manner, enterprise network operators should monitor logs closely and be prepared to modify access policies based on operational experience.

#### 7.3.7 Expanding the ZTA

When sufficient confidence is gained and the workflow policy set is refined, the enterprise enters the steady operational phase. The network and assets are still monitored, and traffic is logged (see Section 2.1), but responses and policy modifications are made at a lower tempo as they should not be severe. Feedback from the subjects and stakeholders of the resources and processes involved should also be incorporated to improve operations. At this stage, enterprise administrators can begin planning the next phase of ZT deployment. Like the previous rollout, a candidate workflow and solution set need to be identified, and initial policies developed.

However, if significant changes occur to the workflow, the operating ZT architecture needs to be reevaluated. Major changes to the system—such as new devices, major software updates (especially ZT logical components), and shifts in organizational structure—may result in changes to the workflow or policies. In effect, the entire process should be reconsidered, assuming that some of the work has already been done. For example, if new devices have been purchased but no new user accounts have been created, only the device inventory needs to be updated.
