### Electron Version
13.1.2

### Operating System
Windows 7 SP1 (including the latest patches)

### Architecture
x64

### Last Known Working Electron Version
N/A

### Expected Behavior
When calling `webContents.print()` with the minimal set of options and a valid printer device as returned by `contents.getPrinters()`, the document should be added to the printer's print queue and subsequently printed.

Example:
```javascript
const options = {
  silent: true,
  deviceName: 'My-Printer',
};
await win.webContents.print(options);
```

### Actual Behavior
The call to `win.webContents.print` returns silently, indicating success, but no document is added to the printer's print queue, and no printing occurs.

### Testcase Gist URL
N/A

### Additional Information
The printer in question works correctly with other applications, so the issue is not related to the printer, driver, or operating system.
