### Summary of the Log Chunk

The provided log chunk, spanning from 18:08:20 to 18:08:26 on October 18th, documents a series of issues and retries in a Hadoop environment. The key points are as follows:

1. **Address Changes**:
   - Multiple address changes are detected for both the `LeaseRenewer` (port 9000) and the `RMCommunicator Allocator` (port 8030). 
   - The old addresses include the IP `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170`, while the new addresses use the hostname `msra-sa-41`.

2. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component fails to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` multiple times, with the failure duration increasing by one second each time (from 203 seconds to 208 seconds).
   - Each failure is followed by a message indicating that a retry will be attempted shortly.

3. **Connection Retries to RM Server**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempts to connect to the ResourceManager (RM) server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The system retries the connection up to 10 times, with a fixed sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between retries.
   - Errors are logged when the allocator fails to contact the RM server, specifically noting "ERROR IN CONTACTING RM."

### Conclusion

The log indicates ongoing issues with address changes and lease renewals, leading to repeated failures and retries. The system is attempting to handle these issues by retrying connections and lease renewals, but the underlying problems (likely related to network or configuration) need to be addressed to resolve the errors.
