### VoIP Telephony
- **Signaling and Media**

### Signaling Protocols
- **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol):**
  - Developed by the IETF
  - Replacement for desk phones and PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network)

- **H.323:**
  - Created by the ITU-T
  - Focused on videoconferencing but also used for voice calls

- **SCCP (Skinny):**
  - Cisco proprietary protocol used for line-side control of phones

### Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
- **Text-based protocol**
- **Applications:**
  - Audio and video calls using RTP
  - Text messages using SIP "Message" method
- **Works with other protocols:**
  - SDP (Session Description Protocol) for media negotiation and setup
  - Can operate over TCP, UDP, or SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)
- **Security:**
  - Provided by TLS (SIP over TLS)

### Softphone Clients
- **Programs for making telephone calls over IP:**
  - Zoiper
  - X-Lite
  - LinPhone
  - MicroSIP

- **Factors in choosing a good softphone client:**
  - Check codec support
  - Check encryption capabilities (especially in free versions)
  - Other functionalities (e.g., text message option, hold, waiting, etc.)

### Asterisk Now

### Scenario

### Possible Configurations
- SIP + RTP
- SIP over TLS + RTP
- SIP + SRTP
- SIP over TLS + SRTP

### SIP/SDP Packets

### RTCP Packets

### RTP Packets

### Recovered VoIP Calls

### Flow Sequence

### Reconstructed Call

### SRTP Key in SDP Packet

### SRTP Traffic

### Encrypted Call

### No SIP Traffic

### TLS Traffic (SIP over TLS)

### No RTP Traffic
- Wireshark uses the SDP packet to determine the port for RTP/SRTP streams.
- If SIP and SDP are encrypted, Wireshark cannot determine the ports.

### Undecoded RTP Traffic

### Decode As

### Decode As RTP

### Checking RTP Streams

### Analyzing RTP Streams

### Playing RTP Streams

### TLS Key Exchange Methods
- **Symmetric Ciphers:**
  - AES, Blowfish
- **Options:**
  - DHE (Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange)
  - RSA (Asymmetric Encryption)

### Diffie-Hellman Exchange
- **Assumption:**
  - An attacker, even after seeing the exchanged colors, cannot guess the secret color.
  - The attacker knows the public keys but not the private key.

- [More on Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)

### RSA (Asymmetric Encryption)

### Observations
- **Cannot recover keys derived with ECDHE/DHE by listening to traffic.**
- **For RSA, if the server's private key is obtained, the traffic can be decrypted.**

### TLS Traffic (SIP over TLS)

### Undecoded SRTP Traffic

### Decode As

### Decode As RTP

### Checking RTP Streams

### Analyzing RTP Streams

### Playing RTP Streams

### RSA-based Key Exchange

### Decrypting TLS Traffic
- **RSA is used to exchange keys.**
- **Decryption requires the private key installed on Asterisk One.**
- **Key and certificate location on Asterisk One: /etc/asterisk/keys**
- **The default.key file must be obtained from the server.**

### Edit > Preferences > Protocol > SSL

### Adding Asterisk Default Private Key

### Decrypted SIP Traffic

### SRTP Key in SIP/SDP Decrypted Packet

### Open Source Tools for Decrypting SRTP
- **SRTP Decrypt:**
  - Tool to decipher SRTP packets
  - Takes a symmetric key to decrypt SRTP traffic
  - Outputs decrypted packets in hexdump format
  - Wireshark can reconstruct RTP packets from the hexdump

- **Libsrtp**

- **GitHub: [SRTP Decrypt](https://github.com/gteissier/srtp-decrypt)**

### SRTP Decrypt: Pre-Installation
- **Install libgcrypt**
- **Install libpcap**

### SRTP Decrypt: Installation
- **Cloning**
- **Compiling**

### SRTP Decrypt: Ready

### SRTP Decrypt: Copying SRTP Key

### SRTP Decrypt: UDP Ports

### SRTP Decrypt: Decrypting SRTP Traffic
- **Command:**
  ```sh
  ./srtp-decrypt -k uK+RfjSi9/fUFr8zoJu6zdqPw6MGtONhgX4yqwRj decoded.raw
  ```
