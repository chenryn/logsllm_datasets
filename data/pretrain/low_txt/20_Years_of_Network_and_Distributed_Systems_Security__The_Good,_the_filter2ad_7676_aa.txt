## Why Me?

- My first NDSS was in 2006.
- My first work on distributed systems was in 1967.

## Early Work in the Midwest

### Secure Transport Service
- Developed secure transport services for early distributed systems.

### Minute III ICBM
- Involved in the development of secure communication protocols for the Minute III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM).

## 1970: Moved to UCLA

### Simulations for Arpanet Protocols
- Conducted simulations for various Arpanet protocols, including:
  - Packet switching
  - Packet switching with cut-through
  - Aloha (pure and slotted)
  - Carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)
  - Packet radio

### HazelNne Portable Packet Radio
- This mobile field radio for the military used ARPAâ€™s pioneering packet radio network. Each unit created a new node that extended the network.

### SRI Truck for Portable Packet Radio Experiments
- Conducted experiments using a portable SRI truck equipped with packet radio technology.

## The First DEC Spam of 1978

- Sent by an aggressive DEC marketer to every Arpanet address on the West Coast.
- Utilized SNDMSG, which had limited space for To, CC, and Subject fields.
- Manually entered addresses starting in the Subject field, which overflowed into the To header, then into the CC header, and finally into the Body due to the limitation of 320 addresses.

DIGITAL WILL BE GIVING A PRODUCT PRESENTATION OF THE NEWEST MEMBERS OF THE DECSYSTEM-20 FAMILY; THE DECSYSTEM-2020, 2020T, 2060, AND 2060T. THE DECSYSTEM-20 FAMILY OF COMPUTERS HAS EVOLVED FROM THE TENEX OPERATING SYSTEM AND THE DECSYSTEM-10 COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE. BOTH THE DECSYSTEM-2060T AND 2020T OFFER FULL ARPANET SUPPORT UNDER THE TOPS-20 OPERATING SYSTEM. THE DECSYSTEM-2060 IS AN UPWARD EXTENSION OF THE CURRENT DECSYSTEM 2040 AND 2050 FAMILY. THE DECSYSTEM-2020 IS A NEW LOW END MEMBER OF THE DECSYSTEM-20 FAMILY AND FULLY SOFTWARE COMPATIBLE WITH ALL OF THE OTHER DECSYSTEM-20 MODELS.

WE INVITE YOU TO COME SEE THE 2020 AND HEAR ABOUT THE DECSYSTEM-20 FAMILY AT THE TWO PRODUCT PRESENTATIONS WE WILL BE GIVING IN CALIFORNIA THIS MONTH. THE LOCATIONS WILL BE:
- TUESDAY, MAY 9, 1978 - 2 PM HYATT HOUSE (NEAR THE L.A. AIRPORT) LOS ANGELES, CA
- THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1978 - 2 PM DUNFEY'S ROYAL COACH SAN MATEO, CA

## Methodology for Reviewing the Last 20 Years of NDSS

- Read all of the papers and proceedings from the past 20 years of NDSS.
- Analyzed the trends, advancements, and challenges in network and distributed systems security.
- Categorized the developments into "The Good," "The Bad," and "The Ugly" to provide a comprehensive overview.

This presentation aims to highlight the key milestones, successes, and failures in the field of network and distributed systems security over the past two decades.
