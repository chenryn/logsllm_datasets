### In-Depth Analysis of Malicious IP Addresses and Open Resolver Ecosystem

The project in question, which provided detailed insights into malicious IP addresses, has been discontinued since January 2017. Another initiative, the Shadowserver DNS-scan [21], offers daily information on the number and geographical distribution of open resolvers but does not analyze the behavior of each resolver. Consequently, this data is limited in its ability to provide a comprehensive understanding of the threats posed by open resolvers. The reduction in the number of open resolvers, as noted in our work, does not necessarily correlate with a decrease in associated threats. In fact, the number of open resolvers exhibiting malicious behavior has increased, necessitating a deeper analysis of their behavior for an accurate assessment of their role in the Internet.

Censys [30] and Rapid7 [31] also provide regular scans using ZMap, with Censys offering weekly and Rapid7 providing monthly datasets. These raw scan datasets are more useful because they allow for the inspection of DNS response packets. However, they have limitations. First, the raw data is generated from measurements using a prober, not an authoritative name server. As illustrated in Fig. 2, if the measurement is conducted only at the prober, it is impossible to capture the packet flow of R1 and Q2, making it difficult to investigate the behavior of open resolvers in depth. Additionally, both repositories use ZMap, which may miss packets due to its design. For example, ZMap only stores responses from the target port (e.g., DNS responses from port 53), leading to incomplete measurements that can underestimate the threat of misbehaving resolvers.

To address these gaps, we believe that a systematic and continuous behavioral analysis of the open resolver ecosystem is essential for improving DNS security. Understanding the behavioral changes in open resolvers and developing countermeasures against malicious activities requires sustained observation.

### Private Network Addresses in Incorrect Responses

In Table VIII, we identify four of the top 10 IP addresses with incorrect R2 responses in 2018 as private network addresses (196.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1, 172.30.1.254, and 10.0.0.1). Beyond the top 10, several other private network addresses also appeared in the incorrect responses.

We speculate multiple scenarios that could explain this behavior. For instance, landing on a private network might be a redirection to a webpage for user consent or form submission in a public network (e.g., Wi-Fi in an airport). This behavior could also be a similar redirection involving a specific company's IP address. However, in the case of a private network, and given that our DNS query was sent from outside the network, this behavior is challenging to understand accurately. If it is a DNS server for users inside the network, it implies that connections are also allowed from the outside. For a more precise analysis, we will conduct an in-depth study focusing on these behaviors as future work.

### Open Resolvers as Existing Threats

In Section II-C, we discussed two primary threats posed by open resolvers: DNS amplification (DDoS attacks) and DNS manipulation. Our analysis revealed that millions of open resolvers still exist, indicating that these resolvers can be exploited by adversaries for amplification attacks. The global presence of open resolvers equates to a significant potential threat, as it represents a functional loophole (lack of verification for spoofed source IP addresses).

However, in terms of DNS manipulation, the mere existence of malicious open resolvers does not directly translate to an actual threat. This is because open resolvers play a passive role in DNS resolution. A malicious open resolver can only perform its actions when it receives a domain name resolution request. If no user queries the malicious open resolver, the manipulated DNS record is essentially meaningless. To better understand the threat, we need to examine how often malicious open resolvers are queried by legitimate users. Investigating how these resolvers attract legitimate users is a critical research topic and part of our future work.

To answer these questions, we plan to conduct a follow-up analysis using the annual Day In The Life of the Internet (DITL) collection from the Domain Name System Operations Analysis and Research Center (DNS-OARC). By combining DITL data with our analysis, we aim to measure the actual impact of malicious open resolvers.

### Related Work

Open resolvers can be attacked and abused to conduct various types of attacks. Researchers have conducted extensive studies to understand open DNS resolvers and their associated threats.

**Internet-Wide Scanning:**
Durumeric et al. [32] proposed ZMap, a high-speed application for conducting Internet-wide scans capable of surveying the IPv4 address space within an hour. The Open Resolver Project [4] actively investigates DNS servers worldwide and provides open resolver statistics from March 2013 to January 2017. Shadowserver [21] conducts surveys related to Internet security, including active measurements of open resolvers. Takano et al. [8] focused on DNS server software and their distribution.

**DNS Measurement:**
Many studies have analyzed DNS resolvers, but most have focused on a small subset. Sisson [14] analyzed open resolvers based on sampled scans, covering only a fraction of all open resolvers. Jiang et al. [33] studied the caching behavior of resolvers and identified an attack vector in DNS software. Schomp et al. [34] randomly probed the IPv4 address space to enumerate DNS resolvers and distinguish between recursive resolvers and DNS proxies. Gao et al. [35] analyzed a large set of DNS query-response pairs from over 600 recursive DNS resolvers. Scott et al. [36] used automated clustering algorithms to detect CDN deployments. Hao et al. [37] measured the authoritative DNS deployment patterns of modern web services. Thomas and Mohaisen [38] studied the leakage of Tor’s .onion in the global DNS.

**DNS Manipulation and Poisoning:**
Research on DNS poisoning or manipulation has been active. Antonakakis et al. [6] found that attackers point victims to rogue IP addresses. Kuhrer et al. [9] measured the response authenticity of resolvers and found that many intentionally manipulate DNS resolutions. Schomp et al. [10] highlighted the vulnerability of user-side DNS infrastructure to record injection. Recent work has shown that over 92% of DNS resolution platforms are vulnerable to cache injection [39]. Efforts to improve DNS cache consistency include DNSSEC, which provides authentication and data integrity [40], [41], [42]. Studies have also estimated the number of open resolvers supporting DNSSEC validation in real networks [43], [44]. Perdisci et al. [45] proposed WSEC DNS to protect against poisoning attacks. Pearce et al. [11] introduced Iris, a scalable and lightweight system to detect and measure DNS manipulation.

### Conclusion

In this study, we conducted an up-to-date measurement of the distribution and behavior of open resolvers. Through an Internet-wide probing, we found that about 3 million open resolvers still exist, with many operating in non-standard ways. We detected two primary threats: the potential for DNS amplification DDoS attacks and evidence of abnormal behaviors, such as inappropriate flag bits in DNS responses and incorrect IP addresses. Despite a decrease in the number of open resolvers, the threat of DNS manipulation has increased, underscoring the need for continuous observations to understand and mitigate these risks.
