### Framework Resources
**Page 10**

**Introduction**
This section provides a side-by-side view of project management processes from the CA-PMF and BPR activities from the CA-BPR, which typically occur during the same process phase. Additional OCM resources, including the Prosci® ADKAR® model, are provided for further exploration of OCM concepts.

**CA-OCM Activities in Relation to the CA-PMF and the CA-BPR**
OCM is not performed in isolation but depends on strong coordination with other project workstreams, such as project management (CA-PMF) and Business Process Reengineering (BPR). Figure 2-1 provides an at-a-glance view of high-level activities by process phase for each workstream.
