# Chapter 1: Directory Service Concepts

## Introduction
A directory service provides a central repository for information about computer users and network resources in an organization. Storing administrative data in a central repository offers several benefits:

- **Reduced Data Entry Effort**  
  Centralized management reduces the need for redundant data entry.
- **Consistent Information**  
  Ensures all network services and clients have consistent information about users and resources.
- **Simplified Administration**  
  Simplifies the administration of users and resources.
- **Identification, Authentication, and Authorization**  
  Provides these services for other network services.

In education and enterprise environments, directory services are ideal for managing users and computing resources. Organizations with as few as 10 people can benefit from deploying a directory service.

### Benefits of Directory Services
Directory services centralize system and network administration, simplifying the user experience on the network. With directory services, information about all users—such as their names, passwords, and locations of network home directories—can be maintained centrally rather than on each computer individually. Directory services can also maintain centralized information about printers, computers, and other network resources. This centralization reduces the system administrator's user management burden and allows users to log in to any authorized computer on the network, accessing their personal desktop and files.

### Open Directory Architecture
Apple has built an open, extensible directory services architecture called Open Directory into Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server. A Mac OS X client or Mac OS X Server computer can use Open Directory to retrieve authoritative information about users and network resources from various directory services:

- **LDAP Service on a Mac OS X Server System**
- **NetInfo Service on a Computer with Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server**
- **Active Directory Service on a Microsoft Windows Server**
- **OpenLDAP or Other LDAP Service on a Third-Party Server (e.g., Sun One, Novell eDirectory)**
- **NIS on a UNIX Server**
- **BSD Configuration Files Stored Locally**

Mac OS 9 and Mac OS 8 managed clients also use Open Directory to retrieve some user information. For more details, see the Macintosh Manager chapter in the user management guide.

Additionally, Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server can use Open Directory to discover network services, such as file servers, that make themselves known with the Rendezvous, AppleTalk, SLP, or SMB service discovery protocols.

### Authentication Services
The Open Directory architecture includes authentication services. Open Directory can securely store and validate user passwords for logging into client computers on your network or using other network resources that require authentication. It can enforce policies like password expiration and minimum length. Open Directory can also authenticate Windows computer users for domain login, file service, print service, and other Windows services provided by Mac OS X Server.

### Directory Services and Directory Domains
A directory service acts as an intermediary between application and system software processes, which need information about users and resources, and the directory domains that store this information. In Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server, Open Directory provides directory services and can access information in one or multiple directory domains.

A directory domain stores information in a specialized database optimized for handling many requests and retrieving information quickly. Processes running on Mac OS X computers can use Open Directory services to save information in directory domains. For example, when you create a user account with Workgroup Manager, it uses Open Directory to store the user name and other account information in a directory domain. You can then review this information with Workgroup Manager, which uses Open Directory to retrieve the user information from the directory domain.

Other application and system software processes can also use the user account information stored in directory domains. When someone attempts to log in to a Mac OS X computer, the login process uses Open Directory services to validate the user name and password.

### Historical Perspective
Like Mac OS X, Open Directory has a UNIX heritage. Open Directory provides access to administrative data that UNIX systems have traditionally kept in configuration files, which require significant effort to maintain. Some UNIX systems still rely on these configuration files. Open Directory consolidates the data and distributes it for easier access and maintenance.

### Data Consolidation
For years, UNIX systems have stored administrative information in a collection of files located in the /etc directory. Each UNIX computer had its own set of files, and processes running on a UNIX computer read these files when they needed administrative information. Common files include `group`, `hosts`, `hosts.eq`, and `master.passwd`. For example, a process needing a user's password would consult the `/etc/master.passwd` file, which contains a record for each user account. A process needing group information would consult the `/etc/group` file.

Open Directory consolidates this administrative information, simplifying the interactions between processes and the administrative data they create and use.
