**Title:** Metabolomic Analysis of Hydrophilic Metabolites Using a Combinatorial Ion Pairing and Ion Exchange LC-MS/MS Approach

**Abstract:**
Metabolomic analysis of hydrophilic metabolites is essential in various research areas, including cancer biology, infection studies, diabetes, and plant biology. This analysis aims to understand the fundamental principles of cellular regulation. However, the quantitative and reproducible analysis of charged and hydrophilic central carbon and energy metabolism (CCEM) intermediates is challenging and requires specific quenching and extraction methods to prevent degradation and inter-metabolite conversion.

We employed a combinatorial approach using ion pairing and ion exchange LC-MS/MS to separate and detect 152 phosphorylated, zwitterionic, and carboxylated hydrophilic metabolites. We evaluated cold quenching and cryo-extraction under various pH conditions and categorized stability conditions for different metabolite classes, such as nucleotides, nucleosides, CoA esters, TCA cycle acids, and sugar bisphosphates, in various cell extracts.

Our results demonstrate that even very labile metabolites, such as CoA esters, nucleotides, sugar bisphosphates, GSH, or NAD(P)(H) cofactors, can be stabilized for up to 24 hours at 4°C under specific pH conditions. By spiking non-labeled metabolites into U-13C-labeled E. coli cells immediately before cold quenching and extraction, we quantified the turnover and interconversion rates of various metabolites and identified minimum bias conditions for the analysis of small molecule intermediates in the CCEM.

We provide comprehensive solutions for assessing CCEM intermediates in prokaryotes (in suspension), cancer cells (adherent), and snap-frozen plant tissue.

**Title:** Electroextraction-Based Sample Preparation Strategies for Enrichment of Low-Abundant Metabolites

**Abstract:**
In biomass-limited samples, such as mouse brain tissue, the analysis of low-abundant metabolites remains a challenge due to their concentrations falling below the detection limits of conventional techniques. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) suffer from practical limitations, especially in handling biomass-limited samples.

Electroextraction (EE) is an electromigration-based sample pretreatment technique that applies an electric field over a liquid-liquid system consisting of immiscible organic donor and aqueous acceptor phases. The discontinuous electric field in these systems drives the enrichment of analytes. EE improves detection limits and enables the analysis of low-abundant metabolites, making it highly suitable for miniaturized, high-throughput metabolite analysis. It also allows efficient sample handling and pretreatment, specifically targeting ionic analytes, which comprise approximately 80% of the metabolome.

This presentation will showcase the analysis of low-abundant metabolites using several analytical platforms incorporating EE, including continuous-flow micro-EE, three-phase EE, and hyphenated EE techniques (EE-DI-MS, EE-LC-MS, and EE-CE-MS). A comparison of these platforms will highlight the potential of EE-based strategies for enriching low-abundant metabolites and analyzing biomass-limited samples.

**Title:** Automating Lipidomic Extraction: Enhancing Efficiency and Accuracy

**Abstract:**
Lipids are ubiquitous biomolecules with diverse functions in cell structuration, energy storage, and signaling, making them valuable biomarkers for diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. Mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with liquid chromatography (LC) or gas chromatography (GC) is commonly used for lipid analysis. However, the sample preparation step is time-consuming and prone to errors, particularly when dealing with large numbers of samples.

To address this, MetaToul-Lipidomic has acquired a TECAN robot to automate lipid extraction. This presentation will detail the optimization steps required to validate fatty acid, neutral lipid, and phospholipid profiling. These optimizations include adjusting solvent sampling accuracy, adding air gaps, and modifying extraction speeds. Initial results from fully automated sample preparation for liver and plasma samples will be presented.

**Title:** Metabolomics: A Central Approach for Studying the Exposome

**Abstract:**
Most human diseases result from interactions between environmental exposures and an individual's genome. The exposome encompasses dietary, pharmacologic, industrial, and personal use products to which an individual is exposed. Metabolomics provides a powerful means to capture biological responses to these exposures and supports the detection and quantification of xenobiotic chemicals and their metabolites.

This presentation will highlight the central role of metabolomics in environmental health research, including examples of how metabolomics connects external exposures, internal body burden of chemicals and their metabolites, biological responses, and health outcomes. New efforts within the Chemical Identification Discovery Cores of the US National Institutes of Health Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium aim to identify large numbers of uncharacterized low-abundance mass spectral signals in biospecimens. By using xenobiotic detoxification enzymes, we can generate and confirm the identities of xenobiotic metabolites. This high-throughput approach, combined with liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry, supports the identification of xenobiotic metabolites. Studies with well-characterized xenobiotics demonstrate the utility of this approach and reveal previously uncharacterized xenobiotic metabolites. Future work will expand this method to support mega-scale metabolite identification for large chemical libraries.

**Title:** Metabolomes of Mitochondrial Diseases and Inclusion Body Myositis Patients: Treatment Targets and Biomarkers

**Abstract:**
Mitochondrial disorders (MDs) are inherited multi-organ diseases with variable phenotypes. Inclusion body myositis (IBM), a sporadic inflammatory muscle disease, also exhibits mitochondrial dysfunction. We investigated whether primary and secondary MDs modify metabolism to reveal pathogenic pathways and biomarkers.

We analyzed the metabolomes of 25 mitochondrial myopathy or ataxia patients, 16 unaffected carriers, six IBM patients, 15 non-mitochondrial neuromuscular disease (NMD) patients, and 30 matched controls. MD and IBM metabolomes clustered separately from controls and NMDs. Both MDs and IBM showed changes in the transsulfuration pathway; creatine and niacinamide depletion were observed in NMDs, IBM, and infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA). Low blood and muscle arginine levels were specific to patients with the m.3243A>G mutation. A four-metabolite blood multi-biomarker (sorbitol, alanine, myoinositol, cystathionine) distinguished primary MDs from others with 76% sensitivity and 95% specificity.

Our omics approach identified pathways currently used to treat NMDs and mitochondrial stroke-like episodes and proposes nicotinamide riboside in MDs and IBM, and creatine in IOSCA and IBM as novel treatment targets. Disease-specific metabolic fingerprints serve as valuable multi-biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring disease progression and treatment effects.

**Title:** Boosting Anti-Doping Screening Through Metabolomics

**Abstract:**
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) prohibits the use of recombinant analogs of human hormones in sports competitions. Despite this, their use is suspected to be widespread among professional athletes who take hormones in micro-doses to achieve mild but continuous anabolic effects while reducing detectability. Recombinant Growth Hormone (recGH) detection is particularly challenging due to its short half-life and the influence of confounding factors such as age and hormonal profiles.

In this proof-of-principle study, we applied LC-HRMS-based metabolomics and lipidomics workflows on human bio-fluids (urine and plasma) to trace recGH administration indirectly. The study included 16 well-trained volunteers split into two groups: one administered micro-doses of erythropoietin (EPO) and the other micro-doses of EPO + recGH. The two groups exhibited different metabolic profiles, especially in plasma lipids. High intra-group variability suggested a subject-specific effect of the hormones. Data normalization against the baseline allowed us to track the subject-specific profile associated with the treatment.

Biomarker identification highlighted several affected metabolic pathways, including triglyceride catabolism and amino acid turnover. In contrast, WADA-approved recGH tests did not detect recGH intake. Metabolomics appears to be a promising tool for screening illicit recGH administration.

**Title:** A Novel Metabolomics Method for Quantitative Analysis of Over 1,000 Metabolites

**Abstract:**
Metabolomics, the science of studying endogenous small molecular metabolites, has made significant progress in various fields, including diseases, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and the environment. The most common method is the non-targeted approach, which aims to analyze "all" metabolites without bias. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-mass spectrometry (MS) can detect thousands of features and identify hundreds of metabolites. However, the complexity of the metabolome still poses challenges for systems biology research.

This study focuses on developing novel LC-MS-based analytical methods for the quantitative detection of more than 1,000 metabolites. We address three key scientific problems: 1) extending analytical peak capacity using two-dimensional LC, 2) selecting quantitative ion pairs using computational metabolomics algorithms and the SWAT method, and 3) annotating metabolic profiles and identifying peaks by studying structure-retention and structure-fragment relationships with standard samples and internet databases.

Through these measures, we have established a novel metabolomics method to quantitatively analyze more than 1,000 metabolites in biological samples, including body fluids, tissues, and cells. This report will present the latest results of our study.

**Title:** Post-Mortem Changes in the Metabolomic Profiles of Animal and Human Tissues

**Abstract:**
Analyzing post-mortem metabolomic changes in biological fluids can lead to new methods for estimating the post-mortem interval (PMI), a critical issue in forensic medicine. Autopsy materials are often used as control tissues in humans due to the inaccessibility of healthy tissues. To use these materials correctly, a detailed description of the changes in the metabolomic content of autopsy tissues is necessary.

We used high-frequency 1H NMR and high-resolution LC-MS to measure the quantitative levels of 61 metabolites in rabbit and human serum, aqueous humor (AH), and vitreous humor (VH) at different PMIs. Our results indicate that ocular fluids (AH and VH) are better suited for PMI estimation than blood serum, as post-mortem metabolomic changes in ocular fluids proceed slower and with lower data scattering. The most significant and linear increases in metabolite concentrations over time were observed for glycerol (rabbit), betaine (human), and hypoxanthine and choline (both).

These findings suggest that choline, glycerol, and betaine are potential biomarkers for PMI estimation. This work is supported by RFBR (Projects №18-34-00137, 19-34-80008).

**Title:** Omega-6 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Metabolites Are Associated with Vitamin D Levels in Early Life

**Abstract:**
Vitamin D is a crucial regulator of the immune system, and low vitamin D levels are linked to various immunological disorders. Untargeted metabolomics offers a comprehensive approach to examine changes in the metabolic profile associated with variations in vitamin D levels.

This study included children from the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial, with plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and metabolomics profiles available at ages 1 (n=451) and 3 (n=407) years. Metabolomic profiling was conducted using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. After quality control, 624 known metabolites remained.

We assessed the associations between individual metabolites and 25(OH)D levels using linear regression, adjusting for potential confounders. Seven metabolites were significantly associated with 25(OH)D levels at both ages, including decreased concentrations of three n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-6PUFA) metabolism pathway members: linoleate(18:2), arachidonate(20:4), and docosapentaenoate(22:5). These associations were replicated in older children from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (p<0.05).

This analysis is the first to characterize the metabolic profile associated with 25(OH)D levels at two time points in early life, with replication in an independent population. The association between increased 25(OH)D levels and decreased n-6PUFA metabolites is important, as both are involved in inflammatory processes. Evidence from cell and animal studies suggests that the active form of vitamin D may influence n-6PUFA metabolism.

**Title:** Comprehensive Metabolomic and Immunological Profiling of Asthma COPD Overlap (ACO)

**Abstract:**
Asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap, termed ACO, is a complex heterogeneous disease with unclear diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. This study aims to determine whether ACO has a distinct metabolic and immunological mediator profile compared to asthma and COPD.

The discovery phase patient cohort consisted of 33 controls, 34 asthma patients, 30 COPD patients, and 35 ACO patients. The validation phase included 32 asthma patients, 32 COPD patients, and 40 ACO patients. Serum and exhaled breath condensates (EBC) were collected and characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolomics. Immunological mediator profiling (Th1, Th2, Th17 cytokines, and soluble immune mediators) was assessed using ELISA kits and magnetic bead-based multiplexing assays.

Multivariate and univariate analysis of NMR and MS metabolomics of combined serum and EBC profiles indicated dysregulated metabolites in ACO patients compared to asthma and COPD, validated in a fresh cohort. Our findings suggest that ACO has an enhanced energy and metabolic burden and altered inflammatory and immune profiles compared to the parent diseases. This study will stimulate further exploration of ACO and unravel the pathophysiological complexities associated with the disease.

**Title:** The Relationship Between the Maternal Metabolome and Childhood Asthma: Results from the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART)

**Abstract:**
Several prenatal and perinatal factors, including maternal smoking, diet, and pregnancy complications, have been implicated in the development of childhood asthma. The maternal metabolome during pregnancy may provide valuable mechanistic insights and novel hypotheses in asthma pathophysiology.

This analysis included non-smoking pregnant women and their children who participated in VDAART, a randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of prenatal vitamin D supplementation on offspring asthma (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00920621). Asthma outcomes were defined as physician-diagnosed asthma or recurrent wheezing by age 3 and 6 years. Metabolomic profiling in 775 mothers at 10-18 weeks gestation was conducted using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. After quality control, 734 known metabolites remained.

We assessed the prospective associations between individual maternal plasma metabolites and childhood asthma/wheezing using multivariable logistic regression models. In 719 mother-child pairs, top maternal metabolites associated with asthma/wheezing by age 3 were 2-aminoadipate (P-value=8.91e-4), tyramine O-sulfate (P-value=1.05e-3), and vanillactate (P-value=3.02e-3). Vanillactate and 2-aminoadipate were also associated with asthma/wheezing by age 6 (n=775, P-values=2.35e-3, 4.07e-3). Among 25 and 18 metabolites associated with asthma/wheezing by age 3 and 6, respectively (P-value<0.05), thyroxine, 3-methylcatechol sulfate, and theophylline were also common. 2-aminoadipate and thyroxine had positive, while others demonstrated inverse relations with the outcomes.

We identified several prenatal metabolites associated with childhood asthma/wheezing. 2-aminoadipate, linked to diabetes and atherosclerosis, is a lysine oxidation product by myeloperoxidase in inflammation. Theophylline, a caffeine metabolite and known asthma therapy, has bronchodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Validation in similarly designed independent cohorts is needed to confirm these associations.

**Title:** Can Stage-Specific Metabolites Be Recovered from Mixed-Stage C. elegans Cultures?

**Abstract:**
Caenorhabditis elegans develops through six distinct developmental stages over its approximately three-day life cycle. Under unfavorable conditions, it can enter the dauer stage, which can persist for months and is specialized for dispersal. Each developmental stage is unique in terms of gene expression, cell number, cuticle structure, and metabolism.

Methods are available to synchronize cultures to isolate stage-specific nematodes, but these methods are time-consuming and can disrupt normal development. Synchronization complicates large-scale discovery metabolomics, as the choices are to either focus on one specific stage or perform a synchronization step for each given life-cycle stage, thereby increasing handling time.

We are using natural diversity and targeted genetic mutations in C. elegans for a large-scale NIH Common Fund project to identify unknown metabolites enabled by genetics and quantum chemistry. To enable experiments on mixed-stage populations, we are developing methods to deconvolve mixtures in both LC-MS and NMR data by leveraging a series of stage-specific and mixed-stage experiments. Our approach would allow us to identify C. elegans developmental stages within a mixed-stage population using a large-particle flow cytometer. Each stage can then be associated with LC-MS or NMR features, or vice versa.

We will present progress on this approach using the N2 reference strain and discuss how it can be extended to other genotypes.
