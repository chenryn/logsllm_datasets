A few days after uninstalling Python 3.4.2, I had to perform a system restore on my Windows 7 machine due to the accidental installation of several unwanted programs that were causing issues even after being uninstalled. The system restore process effectively "reinstalled" Python, but in a broken state. Now, I am unable to uninstall it using the standard method via Control Panel > Uninstall Programs, and I also cannot reinstall it using the original installer.

Both the uninstall and reinstall processes make some progress before stopping with an error message: "There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected. Contact your support personnel or package vendor."

Unfortunately, there are no earlier system snapshots available for me to restore. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can successfully uninstall Python?

**Solution Suggestion:**
One user reported resolving a similar issue by first attempting to repair the installation, and then proceeding with the uninstallation.
