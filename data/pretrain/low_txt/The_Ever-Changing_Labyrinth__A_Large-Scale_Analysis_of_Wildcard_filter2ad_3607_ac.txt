### 4.3 Detection Results

As shown in Table 1, the number of wildcard DNS domains and SEO domains varies significantly across different Top-Level Domains (TLDs) and Second-Level Domains (SLDs). Below, we detail our findings for old TLDs, new gTLDs, and generic SLDs:

#### Old TLDs
Among the old TLDs open for general registration, such as .cc, .pw, .com, and .cn, we observed a significant number of wildcard DNS domains, ranging from 9% to 66%. The number of wildcard DNS domains used for spider pools is also substantial, with more than 200,000 .cn, 30,000 .com, 10,000 .cc, and 40,000 .pw domains. The ratio of SEO domains under .pw (17.7%) is notably higher than other TLDs. It has been reported that .pw domains are frequently used for email spam [38], and our results confirm their popularity among SEO practitioners. In contrast, due to stricter controls, only a small percentage of .gov and .edu domains support wildcard DNS, and we found no SEO domains among them.

#### New gTLDs
Since ICANN launched the new gTLD program in 2011, the TLD space has expanded dramatically, with over 1,000 new gTLDs introduced, compared to just a few dozen before 2011. The registrars under these TLDs often promote domain registrations through discounts, attracting a large volume of registrations [21]. For example, around 1.7 million domains have been registered under .xyz. However, it has also been reported that some new gTLDs were poorly managed, leading to a high number of spam and malware domains [19]. Our research supports this finding, as we identified 137,000 SEO domains, with 8 out of 10 new gTLDs having more than 1,000 SEO domains each.

#### Generic SLDs
Similar to TLDs, a generic SLD typically represents domains used for a common purpose or managed by a central institution. We studied three out of seven generic SLDs under .cn [9]. Similar to .gov and .edu, domain registration and resale under .edu.cn and .gov.cn are tightly controlled, and we did not identify any spider pool domains under .edu.cn. However, we found a small number of SEO domains under .gov.cn. Surprisingly, we captured more than 20,000 SEO domains (28.1%) under .ac.cn, which represents research institutes in China. Domain registration is managed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Xinnet, and applicants must prove they represent a valid research institute. This suggests that registration policies may not be fully enforced, and we recommend authorities to strengthen the registration process.

### 5. Measurement

Our large-scale DNS probing revealed a massive number of domains used for spider pool SEO. In this section, we measure the infrastructure characteristics, including IP and location distribution, domain registrars, and registrant distribution, to understand how attackers' resources are organized. We also extend our understanding of the spider pool business model by sampling detected SEO domains and using 20 of them as seeds to identify new spider pool campaigns. We present our findings below.

#### 5.1 SEO Domains

We first evaluate the distribution of SEO domains among spider pools' hosting infrastructure and their registration patterns. We then selected one spider pool (SSP) and monitored its SEO domains for one month to measure their dynamics.

**IP Distribution:**
To determine if distributed hosting is a popular design choice, we issued DNS queries to all 458,246 SEO domains detected in Section 4.1. Excluding unresolvable domains, we obtained 28,443 IP addresses associated with 434,731 domains. Using the API provided by ip-api.com, we retrieved their Autonomous System Number (ASN) and country information. Our results show that over 28,000 IPs were identified, with each IP hosting fewer than 16 domains on average. However, adversaries prefer to assign a large number of SEO domains to certain ASNs, likely to reduce management costs. Table 2 lists the top 10 ASNs, which host 87.6% of all domains, with AS6939 hosting nearly 95,000 domains (21.7%).

**Geolocation:**
Next, we examined the geographic locations of the hosts. Most domains (80.5% of 434,731) and IP addresses (80.7% of 28,443) were hosted in the United States, as shown in Table 3. In contrast, only 4.5% of the domains are hosted in China, despite most spider pool campaigns targeting the Chinese market. This arrangement is likely to avoid interventions from local governments, such as server takedowns and seizures.

**Domain Registration:**
We also inspected the registration information for the 458,246 SEO domains, obtaining valid Whois data for 425,345 domains. Similar to the ASN distribution, most SEO domains are offered by a small number of registrars. Table 4 lists the top 10 registrars, accounting for 81.8% of SEO domains. Among them, 21.0% were registered under Chengdu West Dimension Digital Technology CO. Additionally, many SEO domains are owned by a small number of registrants, with the top 10 registrants controlling 51.9% of the domains (Table 5). Interestingly, many registrants provide email addresses instead of using private registration to hide their identities. Figure 7 illustrates the monthly registration activity of SEO domains, with peaks observed in October 2015 and February 2016. Since the domains are disposable, most are registered for only 1 or 2 years.

**Structure Dynamics:**
To understand the maintenance strategies of spider pool infrastructures, we monitored the structural changes of SSP for 25 days in January 2016. We used the same spider pool explorer described in Section 3 to crawl SSP daily and store the discovered SEO domains. Figure 8 shows the daily number of SEO domains and newly recruited domains. The structure was relatively stable for the first two weeks but changed drastically in the third week, with the number of SEO domains increasing to 1,800 and then dropping back to 600. By inspecting the registration information, we found that many domains were set to expire during that week, prompting the purchase of new domains to replenish the spider pool. As a result, the size of the spider pool rebounded to 1,600 on the 25th day.

#### 5.2 Statistics of Spider Pool Campaigns

Our measurement study provides an overall view of SEO domains used for spider pools. In this subsection, we examine the structure of individual spider pools, including SEO domains and customer domains/URLs. We sampled one domain per TLD/SLD as a seed and used the crawling method described in Section 3.2 to discover the entire spider pool infrastructure. For TLDs/SLDs with a high number of SEO domains, like .cn and .ac.cn, we sampled additional domains. Each newly discovered spider pool was compared with previous ones, and if the overlap of SEO domains exceeded 50%, the spider pool was discarded. Through this process, we identified 20 independent spider pools, and the statistics are shown in Table 6 (labeled S1 to S20). The results for SSP are also included, with a total of 15,816 SEO domains discovered.

These figures illustrate the dynamic nature of the spider pool infrastructure, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and adaptive countermeasures.
