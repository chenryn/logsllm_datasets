### The RGB-Mix Mechanism and (n-1) Attacks

The RGB-mix mechanism [18] utilizes heartbeat loop messages to detect (n-1) attacks [45]. Each mix node sends heartbeat messages back to itself, and if an (n-1) attack is detected, the mix injects cover traffic to confuse the adversary. However, this mechanism's key assumption is limited to ensuring anonymity among mix peers.

### Mixmaster and Mixminion: Infrastructure of Pingers

Mixmaster [39] and Mixminion [14] employed an infrastructure of pingers [43], which are special clients that send probe traffic through different paths in the mix network and publicly record the observed reliability of delivery. Users can use these reliability statistics to choose which nodes to use.

### Recent Proposals for Anonymous Communication

Recent proposals for anonymous communication have also incorporated built-in reliability mechanisms. For example, the Loopix [44] mix-network system uses loop cover traffic to detect (n-1) attacks, both for clients and mixes. However, this approach is limited to detecting only aggressive (n-1) attacks, and mix nodes that systematically drop single packets can operate undetected. Additionally, the authors do not specify any follow-up actions or penalties for misbehaving mixes.

### The Atom Messaging System

The Atom [33] messaging system is an alternative design to traditional mix networks and uses trap messages to detect misbehaving servers. The sender submits a trap ciphertext along with the message ciphertext, and later uses it to check whether the relaying server modified the message. However, the trap message does not identify which mix failed. Moreover, Atom does not describe any technique to exclude malicious servers, and a failed trap only protects against the release of secret keys.

### Other Approaches: Secure Electronic Elections

The literature on secure electronic elections has focused on reliable mixing to ensure the integrity of election results using zero-knowledge proofs [3, 6, 29] to verify correct shuffling. However, these methods rely on computationally intensive primitives and require re-encryption mix networks, significantly increasing performance costs and limiting their applicability. More efficient proofs restrict message sizes to a single group element, which is too small for email or instant messaging.

### Mix-Nets with Randomized Partial Checking (RPC)

An alternative approach for verifying the correctness of the mixing operation is the use of mix-nets with randomized partial checking (RPC) [30]. This cut-and-choose technique detects packet drops in both Chaumian and re-encryption mixnets but requires interactivity and considerable network bandwidth. Additionally, mix nodes must routinely disclose information about their input/output relations, which was later proven to be flawed [32].

### Limitations and Future Work

#### Challenges for Making Miranda Practical

The Miranda design includes several simplifying assumptions: (1) a fixed set of mixes, (2) a majority of benign mixes, (3) reliable communication and processing, and (4) synchronized clocks. These assumptions are limiting for practical deployment. Future work should aim to avoid these assumptions while maintaining tight security analysis and properties.

Avoiding the clock synchronization assumption seems straightforward by adopting a secure clock synchronization protocol. However, avoiding the other three assumptions is more challenging.

First, consider assumptions (1) and (2): a fixed set of mixes with a majority of benign mixes. These assumptions are central to Miranda's design, as its goal is to penalize active attackers. If the adversary can retire penalized malicious nodes and replace them with new nodes, there is no real gain in penalizing or exposing the adversary. A practical mixnet must allow a dynamic set of mixes for scalability and churn—mixes joining and leaving over time.

Next, consider the third assumption: reliable communication and processing. In practice, failures will occur, especially due to intentional DoS attacks. Future work may address this challenge by minimizing failures through robust underlying mechanisms and refined assumptions and analysis, such as considering incentives and game-theory analysis, to ensure the system is robust to 'reasonable' levels of failures.

These issues are significant challenges for future research, essential for implementing Miranda in practical systems. For example, such research must develop a reasonable model to allow nodes to join (or re-join) without allowing the adversary to gain a majority by adding many mixes, as in Sybil attacks, and to retain the impact of removing corrupt mixes.

#### Extension to Continuous Mixnet

Miranda is designed for a synchronous mixnet. Recent research in mix networks has shown that continuous-time mixes, especially pool mixes, may allow low-latency communication [44]. Future work may investigate how to integrate Miranda with continuous mixnets like Loopix [44]. Such integration would raise challenges, such as determining when a mix should receive a response from the next mix without leaking information to an attacker.

### Conclusion

In this work, we revisited the problem of protecting mix networks against active attacks. Our analysis showed that active attacks can significantly increase the adversary's chances of de-anonymizing users. Miranda achieves better efficiency than previous designs while quickly detecting and mitigating active adversaries. Miranda employs previously studied techniques such as packet receipts and loop traffic, alongside novel techniques to ensure each dropped packet penalizes the adversary. We focus on problematic links between mixes rather than the mixes themselves and investigate how community detection enhances our mechanism. The overall contribution of our work is an efficient and scalable detection and mitigation of active attacks. For additional details, including implementation and efficiency, see [34].
