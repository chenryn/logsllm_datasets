In the analysis of information leakage, certain appliances exhibit high information leakage, making them easier to identify. For example, in a semi-detached house at 5:45 PM, the kitchen bulb is the easiest to detect, aside from the refrigerator. In contrast, two computers are the hardest to detect due to their low information leakage. Similarly, in a terraced house at 7:45 AM, the microwave is the easiest to detect (besides the refrigerator), while the tumble dryer is the hardest to detect. It is important to note that the ON status of some appliances can be leaked as a combination (e.g., kitchen bulb and living room bulb in the semi-detached house). Additionally, some appliances can be detected from the correlations of energy usage in multiple readings (e.g., dishwasher in the detached house).

These observations align with the ground truth of power consumption in households. The information leakage of each appliance’s ON status can either increase or decrease over time due to the highly fluctuating consumption amounts and usage patterns.

To understand how reading frequency affects privacy risks, we conducted experiments to examine the number of privacy-leaking appliances at six selected times in the same day (3 AM, 7 AM, 11 AM, 3 PM, 7 PM, 11 PM) by varying the reading frequencies (from 1 reading per minute to 1 reading per 15 minutes). The results, plotted in Figure 7, show that more frequent readings lead to more private information leakage. For instance, adversaries can identify the largest number of privacy-leaking appliances if the readings are reported every minute. This aligns with the fact that finer-grained readings result in more privacy leakage.

#### CRC and DRC

To bound the privacy leakage in a reading stream, our privacy-preserving algorithm offers two streaming options: CRC and DRC, which satisfy (ǫ, δm)-Uncertainty. Due to space limitations, we only demonstrate the reading conversion results for a sample detached house on January 1, 2008, in Figure 8. We find that safe readings with respect to privacy parameters ǫ = 0.3, δ = 0.2, and m = 5 are close to the original readings, minimizing reading errors. Meanwhile, we have plotted the reading conversion results for differential privacy [11] by adding generic Laplace noise to ensure 5-DP for the reading stream. The results show that differentially private algorithms lead to much higher errors and significantly fluctuate the output readings.

#### Phantom Load

We also examined the impact of phantom load (power consumption when appliances are OFF, e.g., computers, microwaves, electric ovens, and TVs) on information leakage and the performance of our privacy-preserving algorithm. The phantom loads for these appliances are referenced from sites such as http://standby.lbl.gov/summary-table.html. For example, a computer's phantom load is approximately 3.84% of its regular consumption rate, a TV is about 3.53%, a microwave is around 0.21%, and a washing machine is about 0.48%. In our case study, we assigned phantom loads to the OFF status of these appliances and derived the number of privacy-leaking appliances (PL App #) and the reading errors of CRC and DRC. Table V shows that phantom loads slightly make the readings safer and lead to fewer errors in reading conversions.

#### Limitations and Challenges

**Limitations:**
1. The reading errors of our CRC or DRC-based streaming algorithm can be relatively high if specifying small ǫ, δ, and/or large m (for high privacy demand), compared to aggregation and billing errors (which can be close to zero). This may affect the accuracy of real-time services based on smart meter streams (e.g., load monitoring).
2. As discussed in Section VI-E2, if some appliances are very likely to be ON most of the time (I[t → ax] lies close to 1), such as refrigerators and heating in winter, the information leakage of such appliances cannot be effectively bounded without sacrificing too much utility. However, their ON status leaks very limited privacy since almost all households keep them running all the time.
3. Once a new appliance is connected to the home, the smart meter needs to be re-initialized for the privacy model. Additionally, the reading conversion may violate regulations ensuring the integrity of bills in some countries/regions.

**Challenges:**
1. Smart meter initialization requires exponential complexity (offline) to generate the candidate rate set and each possible consumption rate’s candidate appliance set. For a small or medium number of appliances, the algorithm can be executed once to obtain the exact result. However, for a large number of appliances, a heuristic algorithm (e.g., specifying a termination point) must be used to obtain an approximate result.
2. The information leakage of an appliance is derived based on both consumption rate and time. Quantifying the information leakage from the temporal usage patterns of different appliances (I[t → ax]) is challenging. In the case study on January 1, 2008 (Section VI-E), we surveyed energy consumers to obtain these patterns. Alternatively, we can use the probability distribution function in [10] to estimate such patterns and the corresponding information leakage.

#### Conclusion and Future Work

Smart meter reading streams pose severe privacy threats to electricity consumers on the power grid. Beyond the smart meter privacy issues tackled in the literature, this paper quantitatively measures and mitigates information leakage in such streaming data based on a wide variety of background knowledge, including appliances' consumption rates and temporal usage patterns, and other correlations/patterns of running the same or different appliances at different times. We defined a novel privacy model for time series reading streams and developed a privacy-preserving streaming algorithm that efficiently outputs safe readings with excellent utility. Experiments on real datasets validate the performance of our approach.

Future work can extend our research in several directions:
1. Develop heuristic or approximation algorithms to generate the safe candidate rate set instead of simply setting the termination threshold for recursively traversing A’s power set.
2. Explore other privacy-preserving streaming algorithms for smart meters to further minimize reading errors in real-time applications (e.g., load monitoring).
3. Investigate the background knowledge of consumption transients and the corresponding privacy leakage, and define a rigorous privacy notion to quantify and bound such risks.
4. Extend the research to other time series data, such as stock market data and system/server logs, to explore efficient privacy-preserving solutions.

#### Appendix A: Privacy Preserving Streaming for Dynamic Energy Billing

Besides the constant ~Rin (but without disclosing the tariff in a standard energy billing plan, two different dynamic pricing policies (TOU and TB) are widely adopted by utility companies [2], [27], [20]. To minimize the billing errors under such plans, the smart meter (e.g., household) can locally compute the bill using the input readings ~Rin. At this time, billing can be separated from the CRC or DRC-based privacy-preserving streaming. The output reading stream ~Rout can be transmitted to the utility company in sequence while the smart meter can still privately use ~Rin and TOU or TB plan to calculate the bill (disclosing the bill would not leak any information in the vector ~Rin [17]). In this case, we assume that the smart meter (e.g., a household) is a trusted entity to report the true bill (dynamic pricing) to the utility company.
