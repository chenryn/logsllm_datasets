### Occupying RF Channels and Bandwidth Considerations

When the IoT relay begins streaming, it will occupy an RF channel. However, the bandwidth required is only 8 kHz, which is significantly smaller than the 26 MHz channel available in the 900 MHz ISM band. Additionally, covering a given area requires only a few relays—typically three for any horizontal noise source direction and four for any 3D direction. Therefore, the total bandwidth occupied remains a small fraction of the available spectrum. Even with multiple co-located users, channel contention can be managed through carrier-sensing and channel allocation techniques.

### Related Work

The literature on acoustics and active noise control (ANC) is extensive, with connections to various sub-fields of engineering [20, 24, 25, 30, 35, 36, 39, 49, 51]. For brevity, we focus on two areas most relevant to MUTE: wireless ANC and ANC with lookahead.

#### Wireless ANC

An RF control plane has been proposed in the context of multi-processor ANC, primarily to handle various sound sources in large spaces [23, 26–29, 34]. In these systems, distributed DSP processors communicate over wired or wireless links to achieve real-time, distributed noise cancellation. The concept of "piggybacking" sound over RF to exploit propagation delay differences is not a primary focus in these systems. Moreover, many of these systems are based on simulations [23, 26–28].

#### ANC with Lookahead

Certain car models [1–3] and airplanes [7, 8] implement ANC within their cabins, using reference microphones placed near the engine and connected via wires to DSP devices. This setup provides promising lookahead, but the challenges of inverse-channel estimation are minimal because the noise source positions are known, the noise signal is well-structured, and the acoustic channel is stable. These systems do not incorporate at-ear feedback from headphone microphones, as they are designed to cancel noise broadly around the passenger's head. As a result, effective cancellation is limited to very low frequencies (<100 Hz in Honda vehicles [2]).

In contrast, MUTE introduces wireless forwarding, integrates lookahead awareness into the ANC pipeline, and supports personal noise cancellation up to 4 kHz. The intersection of "personal" ANC and "wireless" lookahead is both technically and architecturally novel, to the best of our knowledge.

#### Sound Forwarding Over RF

The idea of sound forwarding over RF has been applied in various contexts, such as acoustic communication across sound-proof boundaries [37], wireless acoustic MIMO and beamforming [19], and even walkie-talkies and wireless microphones [16, 17]. However, these applications are not aimed at noise cancellation. Some systems have leveraged the propagation delay difference between RF and sound for other purposes, such as ranging and localization [44, 48, 40] and avoiding acoustic collisions in wireless sensor networks [50]. The principle is similar to how earthquake and tsunami sensors [11, 12] work, utilizing the fact that wireless signals travel much faster than ocean waves and tectonic vibrations.

### Conclusion

This paper exploits the velocity gap between RF and sound to enhance active noise cancellation. By anticipating sound milliseconds in advance, our system can compute the anti-noise signal in time, better estimate sound channels, and achieve wider-band cancellation. Additionally, this core idea opens up new architectural possibilities at the intersection of wireless networks and acoustic sensing. This paper represents a first step in these directions.
