### Teaching Methods for Postponing Judgment and Interpretation

Many of these methods were designed to teach students to postpone judgment and interpretation, allowing the situation to speak for itself. By engaging in field research with an open mind, what initially appears coincidental can be transformed into a skill that can be learned. 

Various serendipitous encounters with people and situations often inspired and nudged students' designs in surprising, new, and valuable directions that could not have been foreseen. These unexpected turns were driven by the richness of firsthand, unfiltered experiences. However, such experiences could only occur if the process allowed for them. The risk of micromanaging processes in pursuit of quick fixes or solutions, especially in high-stakes scenarios, can overshadow the potential for learning and innovation.

### Context and Learning Environment

When the primary goal is learning—both for schools and local policymakers—design projects aimed at social innovation benefit from a context shielded from pressures that overemphasize the need for a specific solution in the shortest time possible. The "Welcome to Saint-Gilles" project, for instance, was able to take place without such pressures, thereby demonstrating to stakeholders the variety of solutions and changes in stakeholder dynamics that design for social innovation can bring about.

### Conclusions

The lessons drawn from experiences in design initiatives aimed at social innovation, where design educators, students, citizens, and policymakers collaborate, are simple yet profound. They offer valuable insights into future points of attention and challenges for design practice, design education, and policymaking.

### Acknowledgements

In the "Welcome to Saint-Gilles" project, students engaged in 17 (Gaver, Boucher, Pennington, & Walker, 2004) activities, which provided a rich and varied learning experience.

### Implications for Design Practice

In a context where the public collaboratively seeks improvements to society, the designer's role can be seen as a catalyst for change. Through interaction, designers set the stage for collaborative solutions, which can later be scaled. To do this effectively, designers need knowledge of societal systems and group facilitation skills. While designers bring specific expertise in design processes, they should integrate insights from other disciplines without becoming pseudo-experts in those fields.

Designers are increasingly embedded within public sector structures, infusing design logic and processes into policymaking and implementation. This integration will inform and inspire new approaches to tackling societal challenges, enriching the design discourse and the skills of agencies focused on social innovation.

### Implications for Design Education

The "Welcome to Saint-Gilles" project underscores the need for design education to expand the knowledge and skill set of educators and students. This includes facilitation, group dynamics, basic urban anthropology or sociology, and business model development. The consolidation and build-up of knowledge from such experiences require more attention.

As design teams incorporate knowledge from other disciplines, new dynamics will emerge. Many design programs still focus heavily on the individual designer, but a more balanced approach that includes team and network skills would better prepare students for future challenges. Integrated curricula that deepen the knowledge and skills acquired through real-life projects of social innovation are essential. Additionally, extracurricular involvement in local communities can enhance students' understanding and commitment to their work.

### Implications for Policymaking

Early and deep involvement in design-driven social innovation initiatives offers policymakers a unique opportunity to engage with their audience and increase empathy and understanding. As project managers, it is crucial for policymakers to understand the needs and processes involved, such as room for experimentation, flexibility, and learning. Involving policymakers in ongoing projects elsewhere can help them become familiar with the methods and approaches, enabling them to adopt appropriate management styles.

Policymakers must recognize that the process is as important as the project, especially since new initiatives are often tied to fixed policy cycles. Flexibility in time and space is necessary for cultural and behavioral changes. When involving schools in designing for social innovation, policymakers should avoid seeing schools as a cheap alternative to professional design practices. Instead, they should view it as a valuable investment in the next generation of problem solvers and community builders.

### Final Thoughts

Investing in social innovation projects should be seen as a long-term commitment. Policymakers and civil servants should be prepared to invest in continuation, experimentation, and scaling, out of respect for local communities and stakeholders. Designers should emphasize this commitment when engaging in participatory projects of social innovation.

### Learning Together: Students and Community Groups Co-Designing for Carbon Reduction in the London Borough of Camden

**Adam Thorpe and Lorraine Gamman**

**Abstract**

In 2012, the London Borough of Camden identified 30 'Green Zones'—local neighborhoods, including King’s Cross where Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design (CSM) is located, characterized by the presence of community champions and/or groups committed to delivering behavioral change for more sustainable living. This article reflects on how the University of the Arts London (UAL) DESIS Lab, working with Camden Council's Sustainability Team, supported students from CSM's BA Product Design and MA Applied Imagination courses to collaborate with local residents to design new ways to reduce carbon emissions. Reflections on the project confirm previous understandings and highlight further challenges for similar DESIS projects. The implications for design practice, education, and policymakers are also considered.

**Introduction and Background**

The theme 'Public and Collaborative' was proposed by Ezio Manzini and colleagues at Parsons, The New School for Design in September 2011, to explore how emerging social networks meet public services and innovation policies and vice versa. This paper shares insights into how the UAL DESIS Lab taught students to support social innovation and work with the local community to design for social change, while adhering to course requirements. We contribute to addressing Margolin's concern about preparing product designers to design for populations in need, not just the market.

**UAL DESIS Lab Structure**

The UAL DESIS Lab is coordinated from the Socially Responsive Design and Innovation Hub at the Design Against Crime Research Centre (DACRC). We deliver practice-based and practice-led research in socially responsive design for innovation and sustainability. We do not have direct access to a cohort of design students, so we negotiate with course leaders to run student projects, typically planning twelve months ahead.

**A Socially Responsive Design Approach**

DACRC projects are user-centered and collaborative, working with diverse stakeholders to co-define design challenges and co-create responses. Our projects combine the infrastructuring of social networks with the design of products and services that address societal needs, constituting an account of design for social innovation and sustainability. We use the term 'socially responsive design' to encompass the range of design activities that prioritize social goals and needs over those of the market.

**Green Camden Public and Collaborative (P&C) Project Set-Up**

In January 2012, Camden Council approached our research team to explore a practice-based research project focusing on reducing carbon emissions by changing behaviors in the London Borough of Camden. The council targeted three distinct stakeholder groups: Camden Council staff, businesses, and residents. We felt that Camden residents represented the best fit for the 'Public and Collaborative' call. During discussions, we became aware of the council's 'Green Zone' initiative, which targeted these groups.
