### Foam and Acoustic Interference Mitigation

**Fig. 15.** Placing a 4 cm thick piece of foam on top of a hard disk drive (HDD) can effectively mitigate acoustic interference. The effectiveness of this method was tested using sound pressure levels (SPL) as high as 103 dB SPL from 1 cm away from the laptop. We observed that write blocking occurred with signals as low as 95.6 dB SPL. This demonstrates the potential for a laptop’s own speakers to attack its internal HDD.

### Beamforming and Concealment

Beamforming or concealing a speaker can make it more difficult to locate and stop. For example, a Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) could target a device from a distance greater than 1 mile, potentially causing malicious effects before the victim could identify the source.

### Acoustic Attacks in Data Centers and Medical Devices

In a private data center, the environment is controlled by a single entity, and systems typically lack co-located speakers that could mount a self-stimulation attack. In a co-located data center, an adversary could pay to place a speaker next to targeted machines. However, the speaker would need to produce inaudible ultrasonic waves due to constant monitoring.

Medical devices require high availability. In hospitals and other medical buildings, the presence of many people makes it challenging to launch audible attacks. While it might be possible to conceal a device, it may also be easier to cause denial of service through other means, such as unplugging cables. However, acoustic attacks could cause denial of service through more sophisticated means, leaving little traceability back to the adversary.

### Related Work

#### Acoustic Interference on Hard Drives

Sandahl et al. [2], Siemens [4], and Rawson and Green [3] have investigated HDD throughput loss due to acoustic interference but did not consider malicious actors or test ultrasonic signals. An engineer demonstrated how yelling at HDD arrays can lead to perceptible drops in I/O throughput [1]. Ortega [6] showed how finding the resonant frequency of HDDs can interfere with their operation, potentially leading to the operating system losing communication with the drive. Ortega also suggested that physical damage to drives is possible using sound.

#### Hard Drive Covert and Side Channels

Previous research has used HDD components' analog features to establish covert channels. Guri et al. [33] utilized thermal sensors to receive data transmitted over heat emissions. Guri et al. [1] used the movements of the actuator arm to generate audible emissions for exfiltrating data from air-gapped machines. Matyunin et al. [34] used the magnetic field generated by the head's movement to build a covert channel.

Less attention has been given to side-channel information-leakage attacks on HDDs. Biedermann et al. [35] showed how a smartphone's magnetic field sensors could deduce information about a machine's operations. Our work explores the effects of injecting acoustic waves into HDDs.

#### Acoustic Side Channels

Recent research has shown how attackers can use acoustic side channels to interfere with computer systems. Genkin et al. [36] extracted cryptographic keys by observing coil whine during decryption. Son et al. [17] used sound to crash drones by affecting gyroscopic sensors. Trippel et al. [8] extended this to spoof the output of capacitive MEMS accelerometers. We used both audible and ultrasonic acoustic waves to attack HDDs.

#### Sensors

Altering sensor output using physical signals is a recent research topic. Depending on the structure of a MEMS gyroscope, performance degradation can be induced by acoustic resonance [37], [38], [39], [17]. Researchers have used gyroscopic sensor data as a side channel to extract information [40], [41]. By inducing magnetic sensors, researchers applied side-channel attacks to anti-lock braking systems [42], hard drives [35], and 3D printers [43]. Park et al. [44] implemented a spoofing attack for IR drop sensors in medical infusion pumps. Foo Kune et al. [45] demonstrated how electromagnetic interference can inject signals into analog sensors. Spooﬁng attacks can control optical flow sensors [46] and accelerometers [8]. Our study expands this work by examining the vibration sensor of the hard drive and exploiting it to cause denial of service (DoS).

### Conclusion

Adversaries without specialized equipment can cause errors in HDDs using either audible or ultrasonic acoustic waves. Audible waves vibrate the read/write head and platters, while ultrasonic waves alter the output of the HDD’s shock sensor, intentionally causing the head to park. These errors can lead to operating system or application-level consequences, including persistent corruption and reboots. Defenses include mitigating attacks in vulnerable frequency bands with attenuation controllers, using sensor fusion to detect attacks, and noise dampening materials to attenuate the signal.

### Appendix A: FEM Model Details

We built a 3D Finite Element Model (FEM) to study the effect of acoustic interference on hard disks using COMSOL (Figure 16). The goal of our simulation is to provide evidence that: (i) the throughput loss is mainly caused by an abnormal displacement between the head disk assembly and the disk; and (ii) this displacement is due to mechanical vibrations induced by the acoustic interference.

Our analysis explores a physical proximity attack scenario, with the hard drive positioned at 10 cm from the speaker (Figure 17). The model estimates, for the head stack assembly top head suspension, a horizontal/vertical maximum displacement of roughly 8 nm and 112 nm, respectively; and for the top disk, a maximum horizontal/vertical displacement of about 33 nm and 156 nm, respectively (Figure 5).

This stationary model highlights how the magnitude of our attack can induce head stack assembly position errors, considering the track read/write thresholds (15/10 percentage of the track width, respectively) [15] and the distance between the head and the disk (roughly 6 nm) [16].

**Model Mechanics:**
The model explores the fine-grained physics of how sound waves affect the mechanical parts composing the hard drive, showing that: (i) the attack mainly affects the head stack assembly and the disks; (ii) the magnitude of the vibration effect depends on the sound pressure generated by the source, i.e., the more the sound pressure increases, the greater the mechanical vibration induced to the hard drive.

**Model Limitations:**
There are two main limitations of this model: (i) The model is stationary, i.e., it does not consider the spindle system rotation. (ii) The simulation does not consider all the dynamics of the hard drive components, such as fluid or ball pivot bearing effects.

Despite these assumptions, the simulation is consistent with previous studies in terms of free vibrations and mode shapes of both disks and head assembly under acoustic interference attack [49], [50], [51]. Furthermore, the simulation correctly predicts the throughput loss investigated in our dynamic study (Section IV).

**Fig. 16.** The complete geometry of the 3D COMSOL model. The speaker diaphragm and the dust cap are positioned at the top of the air domain semi-sphere to replicate an example of a physical proximity attack scenario.

**Fig. 17.** Vertical cross-section plot of the sound pressure level distribution generated by the speaker at 5 kHz frequency. The model replicates a physical proximity attack scenario with the hard drive positioned at 10 cm from the sound source. Note how the sound pressure level decreases with distance following the Inverse Square Law.

A radius cone, set in an infinite baffle, represents the diaphragm and the dust cap of a common speaker. A known sound pressure applied on the dust cap boundary simulates the generated acoustic interference [47]. We designed the mechanical structure of the hard disk in SolidWorks-CAD 3.5. The model includes four read/write heads, an actuator bearing, a voice coil motor, magnets, a spindle, three disks, and the HDD chassis. A semi-sphere represents the acoustic radiation domain of the model, truncated with a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) to mimic an infinite open air domain.

A 100 Pa sound wave at 5 kHz generated by the simulated speaker reaches the hard drive and causes mechanical deformations. Considering, for example, 10 cm of distance between the sound source and the HDD, the sound pressure level measured on the chassis surface is about 120 dB SPL (Figure 17). This follows the Inverse Square Law, i.e., the sound pressure level of a spherical wave decreases with doubling of the distance by -6 dB [48].

Halving the sound pressure of the source to 50 Pa, while maintaining the same frequency and distance from the hard drive, the total displacement of the head assembly top head suspension and disks halved too. Increasing the sound pressure of the source to 360 Pa, the total displacement of the head assembly top head suspension increases to a horizontal/vertical displacement of about 26 nm and 300 nm, respectively. The top disk, on the other hand, reaches a horizontal/vertical total displacement of roughly 50 nm and greater than 1 m, respectively.

The latter analysis highlights how the sound pressure induced by the speaker increases the mechanical displacement of both disks and head assembly by one order of magnitude. This phenomenon significantly increases the probability of performance degradation and throughput loss, because of the possibilities of the read/write head exceeding the read/write fault thresholds or head crashes.
