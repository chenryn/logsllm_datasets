### Approach 1: KL Analysis and Statistical Detection

In this approach, we first partition all signals into disjoint, contiguous time windows. For each window, we perform KL (Karhunen-Loève) analysis by finding the eigenvectors of the process noise using only the non-Trojan signals. We then project the non-Trojan signals onto these eigenvectors and determine the mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\) of the eigenvalue spectrum for each eigenvector.

To determine whether a given signal originates from a genuine IC or an IC with a Trojan, we project the signal onto the process-noise eigenvectors and compute its eigenvalue spectrum. If the eigenvalue spectrum falls outside the \(\mu \pm 4\sigma\) envelope for any eigenvector in any time window, we conclude that the signal is from an IC with a Trojan. Conversely, if the entire spectrum remains within the \(\mu \pm 4\sigma\) envelope for all time windows, we conclude that the signal is from a genuine IC (see Figure 14).

Using this statistical approach, we tested 49 ICs with Trojans using 70 time windows and achieved a 100% success rate in detecting them. We also tested 49 genuine ICs using the same 70 time windows, and only one was incorrectly identified as a Trojan, resulting in a 98% true negative rate (see Figure 15).

### Approach 2: Filtering and Focusing on Low Noise Regions

Another method for Trojan detection in high process-noise environments is to return to the original KL analysis and focus on regions with lower process noise (see Figures 16 and 17). Unlike the earlier case where the Trojan signal overwhelmed the process noise, here the process noise is more prominent. However, KL analysis still allows us to clearly separate the eigenvalue spectrums of signals from genuine and Trojan ICs at multiple eigenvectors.

Figure 18 illustrates that, in our experiments, the eigenvalue spectrums of genuine ICs and ICs with Trojans are distinct on eigenvectors 43, 46, and 48.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we demonstrated the feasibility of building effective fingerprints for an IC family to detect Trojan ICs. We designed and synthesized an RSA circuit and three different Trojan circuits, using power traces from simulations to build the IC fingerprints. We modeled three sets of process variations by introducing random variations (up to ±2%, ±5%, and ±7.5%) in the cell libraries used for synthesis. In all cases, simple analysis of the power signals could distinguish genuine ICs from those containing Trojan circuits, even when the Trojan was as small as 0.01% of the main circuit.

We showed that it is generally difficult to hide the signal distortions introduced by a Trojan circuit, as Trojans leak signals in subspaces not present in genuine ICs. Even when the Trojan signal is well-hidden within the process noise, it can be detected using signal processing techniques.

An adversary with general knowledge of this fingerprinting technique would face significant difficulty and cost in manufacturing a Trojan that can evade these tests, as they do not know the side-channels or testing parameters (e.g., clock frequency) in advance. Additionally, side-channels like EM emissions have multiple sub-channels due to spatial and non-linear effects, making it challenging to design a Trojan that does not leak in any of the side channels for any test parameters.

For future work, we plan to:
1. Work with real fabricated ICs instead of simulated ones.
2. Test much larger ICs, including general-purpose microprocessor architectures.
3. Expand our study to include more side-channels, specifically EM emissions, to detect localized spatial distortions introduced by a Trojan circuit.
4. Explore other signal processing techniques to evaluate their relative efficacy in detecting Trojan ICs.
