When attempting to parse a large CSV file (450MB, approximately 1 million rows) using Go, the memory usage increases to 1.2GB, with a peak at 1.6GB. The program takes around 1.3 minutes to complete.

- **Operating System**: macOS
- **Go Version**: 1.2, 64-bit
- **Code**: [Available here](http://play.golang.org/p/jrVSqCcMpQ)

The CSV file contains some errors, such as missing commas and spaces. During execution, the program pauses for about 10 seconds, during which the memory usage spikes from 600MB to 1.6GB, then stabilizes at 1.2GB.
