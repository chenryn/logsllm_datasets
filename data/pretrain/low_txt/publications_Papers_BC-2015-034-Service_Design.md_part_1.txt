### Opening Case: Accommodation Services

**SLEEPLESS IN ICELAND – WHY PARTIES ARE NOT EVERYBODY’S PIECE OF CAKE**

"I love Iceland! I adore it for its geological uniqueness, the beauty of its nature, its literature and music scene, and, in general, its people. Upon arrival for my last trip to the country, my spouse and I checked into a pleasant four-star hotel in Reykjavik’s city center to be close to the domestic airport for an early morning departure to northern Iceland the next day. The friendly receptionist gave us a nice room on one of the upper floors. All was good, and we went out for dinner in town.

Around 10 PM, back in our hotel room, we realized loud music was coming from somewhere nearby. 'Just some young people out on the street enjoying Reykjavik at night and playing music in their car; they will be gone soon,' we thought. But not so. Over time, the noise level rose, and by 11 PM, we could feel the vibrations of the music's constant beat in our room. I decided to explore where the music came from. So, I left our room and walked along the hallway. The closer I got to the staircases, the louder it got. Level by level, I went down the stairs until I stood right in front of the back doors of the hotel’s conference venue. Obviously, this evening, our hotel was the place to be for Reykjavik’s nightlife scene.

Down in the lobby, a group of sleepless hotel guests had already gathered, and the receptionist confirmed that she would take care of the situation. The music would be turned down soon. Hoping for the best, I headed back to our room, only to return to the reception 30 minutes later due to unchanged loudness and vibrations. This time, the receptionist told everyone there was nothing she could do about the noise. The event department of the hotel had rented out the venue to a large party until late that night. But we could feel free to complain to the hotel’s management the next morning.

Most people left upset, yet, I did not want to yield and asked whether they were fully booked. The lady denied. So, I asked whether there were still some rooms available in the building’s wing that was most distant from the venue and if she would be entitled to change us into another room if we were not satisfied with the one we had. She confirmed all of these points. Lucky me! And, off I went with a new room key, ready for a good night's sleep. However, most of the other disappointed guests probably stayed sleepless for another couple of hours.

Stories like this are common. Nevertheless, it is worth having a closer look at what happened in the opening case. Services lead to experiences on the customer side [1], and service providers aim to optimize this experience. The traveler is looking forward to a great vacation experience starting with a quiet night in a pleasant hotel. The other customers, the participants of the party, are also looking for a great experience, namely a great, loud party until late at night. However, the night ended with both customer groups being unhappy, i.e., the hotel guests being sleepless and the party guests probably having to finish their party sooner than expected. How could this happen? The hotel serves as two service providers, a lodging provider and an event provider, and potentially runs two corresponding business units that operate rather independently. While both units are experienced in providing good services within their own domain, the trouble began when the event department contracted for a service that interfered with the service of the other unit. In other words:

- The business units operated in silos.
- They designed their services from their perspective instead of from the customers’.
- They did not put a proper mechanism in place to handle exceptions.

As an old consultants' wisdom says, 'perception is reality,' i.e., the customer’s perception of a service determines the level of experience gained from a service rather than the imagination of the service provider. Correspondingly, in this chapter, we will discuss methods to deeply understand customers’ needs and design services from their perspective, aiming for an optimized service experience."

### 4.1 Introduction

Based on the opening case and its analysis, it can be conjectured that service design is about making (new) services work as properly and smoothly as possible, i.e., to operationalize them by laying out processes, defining roles, responsibilities, permissions, and prerequisites for the provision of a service. As discussed later, this is an essential part of service design [2]. However, the concept of service design as it is used and researched today goes far beyond the operational aspect. So far, the story has emphasized aspects such as meeting customers’ expectations, handling exceptions, and avoiding disappointments. But designing a service to provide positive experiences includes the opportunity to delight customers, e.g., to offer more than they expected or to conduct a service in a more convenient way.

Nowadays, the term "service design" is often used with a broader meaning. If service design is about improving or even creating new services to positively surprise customers, the terms service design, new service development, and service innovation start to conceptually overlap. Hence, this section will shed some light on the definitions and key characteristics of service design and discuss its relation to the other two concepts. The following sections of this chapter will then introduce methods used for service design and tools that help apply these methods in projects.

#### 4.1.1 Service Design

Service design consists of the two rather broadly defined terms: service and design. Chapter 1 of this book already reflected on the various types of services and what people have in mind when talking about services. This leaves the second term, design, for discussion. Design is used in a broad variety of contexts, such as the design of products, communication design, web design, software or IT-system design, and even (design) methods themselves. Furthermore, design is a verb describing a creative process as well as a noun describing the result of this process. Given the variety of contexts, scholars struggle to agree on a shared definition for the term [3]. Hence, due to the context-bound nature of the term, subsequent focus lies on how the service community defines and uses the term "service design."

Early publications on the topic of service design focus on the modeling and description of services, e.g., blueprinting of services [2]. Correspondingly, and similar to our discussion in the opening case, their definitions of the term "service design" emphasize the description of a service concept primarily through visualizations. Further definitions are broader and refer to the process of creating a concept for a (new) service, including the early creative steps to come up with an idea for a new service [4]. Some authors from the late 1990s and early 2000s specify what a service concept should look like (e.g., [5, 6]). According to them, the service concept ranges from customers’ needs to operationalized actions on how to address them.

**Definition — Service Concept:** The service concept describes in detail the needs of the targeted customers, what actions to take to meet these needs, and how to operationally implement these actions.

Since the first service design researchers originated from various design backgrounds, service design was influenced by a wide range of design disciplines. Therefore, the concept of service design became broader, and recent publications define service design as the process of “systematically applying design methods and principles to the design of services” [7].

In an overview on service design as a field of research, Blomkvist et al. [8] point out that academics initially focused on putting service design in relation to their home disciplines and establishing service design as an own field of research. Meanwhile, research became much wider and deeper and now deals with service design itself, e.g., reflecting on underlying theories, exploring new design techniques, analyzing case studies, or moving towards product-service systems.

Given the diversity of the research field of service design, synonyms and variations to the term service design have emerged and are worth highlighting. Building on the close relation of service design and design thinking [9, 10]—a similar approach originating from product innovation—some authors have framed the term "service design thinking" [11]. Moreover, other researchers emphasize that investigating the needs of customers as well as provider-customer interactions may lead to more than just a good service process. It may also lead to insights about the physical environment, the service employees, the service delivery process, fellow customers, and back-office support [12]. Thus, these authors framed the term "design for services" rather than "service design" [13]. However, this chapter uses the term "service design."

**Definition — Service Design:** The systematic application of design methods and principles to the creation of service concepts for new or improved services (following [7]).

#### 4.1.2 New Service Development and Service Innovation

As the definition and current understanding of research imply, service design is about creating new or improving existing services. This raises the question of how service design differs from the concepts of service innovation as well as new service development (NSD)—another term found in scientific literature addressing the creation of new services. Johnson ([14], p. 5) defines new service development as the “overall process of developing new service offerings.” To delimit the term NSD, the author refers to service design as specifying “the detailed structure, infrastructure, and integration content of a service operations strategy.”

**Definition — New Service Development:** Addresses the “overall process of developing new service offerings” ([14], p. 5).

Looking more closely at the NSD process shows that it covers all the steps of a classical innovation process, from idea generation to market introduction [15]. Service design, on the contrary, aims for a service concept and therefore overlaps only partly with the NSD process. What is more, service design primarily “contributes to service development in areas such as user orientation, contextualization, and design as a strategic instrument” ([7], p. 342). While service innovation was initially seen as a process of service development [16], and therefore was highly overlapping with NSD, today service innovation has become more of a management discipline. As seen in Chapter 3, recent service innovation literature covers a wide range of topics such as service-specific challenges of innovation management, capabilities to sustainably innovate services or processes, and methods and tools for developing new services.

**R Service Innovation:** Service innovation is the overall discipline dealing with the service specifics of innovation management. It includes new service development as the process of creating and establishing new services. Service design covers part of this new service development process and adds the specific perspective of designers to it (Figure 4.2).

#### 4.1.3 Service Design Characteristics

The previous section introduced the three terms: service innovation, new service development, and service design. One key differentiator between the new service development process and service design was the application of design methods and principles to the creation of services. This raises the question of why the perspective of a (service) designer is so valuable for the development of new services.

Service designers aim to understand and improve service experiences by focusing on customers and their interactions with a service provider. In more detail, professionals agree on the following cornerstones ([11, 13, 17, 18]):
- **Human-centric:**
- **Interactive:**
- **Holistic:**
- **Iterative:**
- **Prototype-based:**

Some experts emphasize further characteristics of service design that support and complement these five cornerstones. For instance, they point out the importance of working in interdisciplinary teams to accommodate a multi-perspective understanding of a service and its environment, as well as to receive a broader range of ideas for possible solutions. Furthermore, a visual description of the interactions between parties involved in a service, for instance, to ensure the right speed of service provision, is considered a key element of service design.

**Human-centric:**
In companies, R&D traditionally approaches innovation projects from a technology point of view, and innovation departments apply a management perspective, focusing on market niches, key resources of an organization, revenue models, or whole business models. In terms of customers, it is common practice to define customer segments which are then used in the innovation process. Service design takes a slightly different but complementary approach: It looks at customers on an individual level rather than on a segment level. This means that service designers put themselves in the shoes of a customer or other stakeholders when creating new or improving existing services. Hence, if there is a "true north" of service design, it is this paradigm of human-centricity. Everything else feeds into this notion.

**Interactive:**
To put themselves in the shoes of other humans, service designers have a strong motivation for going out and working as interactively as possible with customers. As the subsequent sections will show, service designers leverage several techniques and tools to interact with and learn from people. The aim of this strong interaction is to understand how individuals perceive a service as comprehensively as possible. Asking and observing customers and engaging in their actions lead to valuable insights.

**Holistic:**
Furthermore, service designers want to understand customers or other stakeholders holistically. This takes place on two levels: first, the designers strive to go far beyond the typical demographics used for customer or stakeholder segments and see their representatives as individuals. Actors try to get an almost tangible picture of the people they are designing for, considering their emotions, behaviors, and contexts.
