**Title: BotConf 2017 - Augmented Intelligence to Scale Human Efforts in Fighting Botnets**

We propose and implement a novel method for detecting botnet activities by identifying new core domains (domains that are directly below a top-level domain, TLD) in real-time DNS query traffic as suspicious. Our approach then uses a domain correlation machine learning model to discover botnet command-and-control (C&C) groups. This method enables the early detection of botnet C&C groups, often outperforming security list vendors in terms of timeliness.
