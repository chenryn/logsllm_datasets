## Abstract
Systems of Systems (SoS) are dynamic, distributed coalitions of autonomous and heterogeneous systems that collaborate to achieve a common goal. While offering several advantages in terms of scalability and flexibility, the SoS paradigm significantly impacts system interoperability and security requirements. In this demo, we present POLIPO, a security framework that combines context-aware access control with trust management and ontology-based services to protect information in SoS.

## 1. Introduction
Systems of Systems (SoS) are coalitions of autonomous systems and services that collaborate to achieve a common goal. These coalitions are often dynamic, with systems joining and leaving, and involve parties employing different vocabularies, data models, and organizational structures. Examples of SoS include Web Services, Mobile Ad-hoc Networks, and air traffic control systems. For the success of a coalition, parties may need to share sensitive information with other parties in the SoS; however, this information should be accessed exclusively by authorized parties, which may vary depending on the context (e.g., in emergency situations or based on the location of the requester).

Several security frameworks for SoS have been proposed, which can be divided into two categories: semantic frameworks and trust management (TM) frameworks. Semantic frameworks rely on ontologies for specifying access control policies and defining domain knowledge and context information. This enables interoperability among parties but limits the expressive power of the policy language, preventing the specification of certain security constraints (e.g., separation of duty). On the other hand, TM frameworks use an attribute-based approach to access control, where decisions are based on digital certificates called credentials. TM frameworks employ expressive policy specification languages to ensure data confidentiality and integrity; however, they either require all parties in an SoS to use the same vocabulary or do not provide a mechanism to align different vocabularies. Thus, none of the existing frameworks satisfy all the requirements imposed by SoS.

In this demo, we present POLIPO, a security framework for SoS developed within the POSEIDON project, a joint project involving industrial (Thales Nederland and Noldus) and academic partners. POLIPO combines context-aware access control with TM and ontology-based services to guarantee the protection of information, autonomy, and interoperability among the parties in an SoS. We demonstrate an application of the framework in the Maritime Safety and Security (MSS) domain.

## 2. The POLIPO Framework

### 2.1 Framework Ingredients
To design POLIPO, we identified the characteristic features of SoS as follows:
- **Dynamicity**: SoS are constantly evolving, with systems joining and leaving, and the information exchanged may be context-dependent.
- **Distribution**: Each system in an SoS is an independent, complex system belonging to a different security domain and governed by a different authority. Parties may not know each other before joining the SoS.
- **Heterogeneity**: Each system may adopt different data and organizational structures and use different vocabularies to define concepts and relationships in an application domain.

To address these challenges, the POLIPO framework combines techniques from computer security and knowledge representation, including:
- **Context-aware access control and TM** to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information. Context-aware access control incorporates context information (e.g., the location of the requester, the criticality of the situation) in access decisions, allowing flexible policies that adapt to different situations. TM deals with the distributed nature of SoS by basing access decisions on the attributes of a requester, certified by digital credentials.
- **Ontology-based services** to enable autonomy and interoperability among the parties in an SoS. Parties use ontology concepts, relationships, and instances to assign semantics to the terms used in their policies. Ontologies also define the data and organizational structures of each party. Combined with semantic alignment techniques, this allows parties to use their preferred vocabulary and structures while preserving mutual understanding.

### 2.2 Framework Architecture
The architecture of the POLIPO framework, inspired by XACML, consists of core security components complemented by an ontology repository and a semantic alignment component. All components are designed as services following the service-oriented architecture paradigm.

- **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)**: Intercepts incoming requests for local resources, contacts the appropriate Policy Decision Point (PDP) to evaluate those requests, and enforces the decision of the PDP. Two types of requests are allowed: access requests and credential requests. Access requests are processed by the Access Control PDP (AC PDP), while credential requests are processed by the Trust Management PDP (TM PDP).
- **Policy Decision Point (PDP)**: Fetches the relevant authorization or credential clauses through the Policy Administration Point (PAP). If the clauses depend on some credential, the AC PDP requests them from the TM PDP, which retrieves them. Once all necessary credentials are collected, the AC PDP determines the access decision. The TM PDP evaluates credential requests using the GEM algorithm, which processes requests in a completely distributed way without disclosing the policies of parties, thereby preserving their confidentiality.
- **Knowledge Base (KB)**: Consists of a set of ontologies defining the concepts and relationships employed in the party’s policies and all domain and context information. Ontology atoms are resolved by requesting their evaluation to the KB.
- **Semantic Alignment Evaluator**: Implements the ontology alignment technique to map attributes defined in different ontologies, enabling the use of semantic alignment techniques to map unknown attributes to known ones.

### 2.3 Prototype Implementation
We deployed a prototype implementation of POLIPO into an SoS in the MSS domain, developed within the POSEIDON project. The SoS consists of three main systems: a patrol vessel of the Italian navy (IT-1), a frigate of the Danish navy (DK-1), and an Operation Control Center (OCC), which collaborate in the context of EU NAVFOR, an anti-piracy operation off the coast of Somalia. Each system employs sensors to gather information from its surroundings, which is integrated with further information from the Internet and intelligence gathered by the parties in the SoS to obtain comprehensive information and derive new knowledge about the current situation.

In this demo, we show how the attributes of a requester and the current context influence access decisions. We present a scenario divided into two parts:
- **Part 1**: An operator of IT-1, patrolling an area south-east of the Horn of Africa, observes two ships suspiciously approaching each other at a nearby location. The operator requests information from DK-1, which is in command of operations in that area. One of the ships, Blue Star, is under investigation by the Danish navy and police for suspected terrorist activities. DK-1 does not provide extra information to the Italian operator because IT-1 is not assigned to the prevention of terrorist activities.
- **Part 2**: Blue Star gets into trouble due to a storm and starts drifting near the Dutch coast. A vessel of the Dutch coastguard (CG-1) prepares to intervene to assist Blue Star’s crew. CG-1 needs information about the cargo transported by Blue Star and sends a request to the OCC of the EU NAVFOR. Due to the emergency situation and CG-1's certification for SAR operations, the OCC provides extra information about Blue Star’s cargo, revealing that it may contain Anthrax intended for distribution to terrorist cells in Europe.

Every request to access the local resources of each party in the SoS is intercepted by its instance of the POLIPO framework, which checks whether the requester possesses the required credentials and returns a response based on the local security policy. The evaluation of a policy might require the alignment of the vocabulary of the local party with that of the other coalition members.

In the POSEIDON SoS, communication among parties is via HTTP. Accordingly, we developed the PEP of the security framework as a web proxy that intercepts all HTTP requests and returns an HTTP response in the expected format, facilitating the deployment of POLIPO without modifying other components of the POSEIDON SoS.

## 3. Conclusions
We presented POLIPO, a security framework that guarantees the protection of information, autonomy, and interoperability among the parties in an SoS by combining context-aware access control with TM and ontology-based services. The framework components are implemented following the service-oriented paradigm, facilitating deployment in existing SoS and allowing for easy integration of additional components to support policy evaluation and provide additional functionalities. Besides the MSS domain, we have also deployed the framework in an SoS in the employability domain.
