**Applies to:**

- Windows Server 2016

- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
Autoconv is a utility that converts file allocation table (FAT) and FAT32 volumes to the NTFS file system. This conversion process ensures that existing files and directories remain intact. The conversion occurs automatically at system startup after the `autochk` utility has run.

**Important Notes:**
- Volumes that have been converted to the NTFS file system cannot be reverted back to FAT or FAT32.
- You cannot run `autoconv` directly from the command line. It can only be executed at startup if it has been set up using the `convert.exe` utility.

**Usage:**
To set up the automatic conversion, use the `convert.exe` utility with the appropriate parameters. For example:
```cmd
convert D: /fs:ntfs
```
This command will schedule the conversion of drive D: to NTFS during the next system startup.
