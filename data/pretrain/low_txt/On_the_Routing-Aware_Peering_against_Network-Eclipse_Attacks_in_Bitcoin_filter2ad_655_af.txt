# Figure 13: Attack Success Rates and Average Number of Established Connections for Three Victims

- **Victim Locations:**
  - (a) London (AS16509)
  - (b) Bangalore (AS14061)
  - (c) Atlanta (AS47065)

**Figure 13** illustrates the attack success rates and the average number of established connections for three victims located in different regions. The figure compares four scenarios:
- No RAP, no tweak
- Tweaks (T3, T4, T5)
- Optimal RAP
- Optimal RAP + Tweaks (T3, T4, T5)

### 7.1 Security Research in Blockchain Networks

Security breaches in the P2P layer of blockchain networks can cause significant damage to the entire system, as the P2.P layer is the fundamental underlying network for the consensus and transaction layers.

#### Eclipse Attacks and Defenses

In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the possibility of eclipsing the P2P networks of blockchain systems [4, 8, 27, 28, 38, 57]. Early eclipse attacks [27] utilized small botnets and exploited specific vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin client software to partition one or more nodes from the P2P network. Similar attacks targeting Ethereum implementation bugs have also been reported [28, 38]. Most of these vulnerabilities were quickly addressed by the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities, rendering the attacks ineffective. More recent research has shown that a malicious AS can control all connections of a targeted Bitcoin node via BGP hijacking [4]. To counter this, a new Bitcoin relay system called SABRE [3] was designed to be robust against BGP hijacking. Another eclipse attack specifically targets Bitcoin nodes connecting via Tor bridges by exploiting the anti-DoS mechanism in Bitcoin [8].

#### Relays and Bitcoin Security

Although Bitcoin is designed as a fully decentralized P2P network, special peer nodes called relays have been proposed for performance and security improvements. Fast relay networks like Falcon [18] and FIBRE [20] speed up block data propagation between closed group members. SABRE [3] ensures BGP-hijacking-free peering. While relying on such relays might seem like a solution to mitigate Erebus attacks, it is not ideal. First, there is a non-negligible chance that some malicious transit ASes are on the paths to the relays. Second, and more importantly, relying on a small number of relays for P2P operations effectively centralizes the network, making it a single point of failure. Relays can be a temporary measure, but they cannot be a long-term solution. This paper focuses on solutions that do not compromise the openness and decentralization of Bitcoin.

## 7.2 Routing Awareness in Tor

Our work is the first to thoroughly evaluate the concept of routing awareness in blockchain systems. The idea of RAP has been explored in Tor [1, 7, 17, 19, 32, 45, 53], where inter-domain route inference algorithms (e.g., Mao et al.'s algorithm [37]) are used to estimate common, suspicious ASes on both connections from a client to a Tor entry node and from a Tor exit node to a destination. Juen et al. [32] compared inferred AS paths with data-plane paths and found an overall 80% difference. These routing-aware mechanisms developed for Tor cannot be directly applied to Bitcoin due to the fundamental differences in their semi-permissionless nature, as discussed in Section 5.4.

## 8. Conclusion

The development of new blockchain consensus ideas while relying on easily eclipsed P2P networks may be building a house of cards. We address a recent eclipse attack that exploits a powerful network-Sybil capability, prioritizing the practicality of countermeasures. Our evaluation shows that routing-aware peering (RAP), a highly promising countermeasure, has disappointing defense performance due to its inherent weaknesses. However, we confirm that Bitcoin can be protected from most Erebus attacks when available countermeasures are carefully optimized and customized for each node. Our work contributes to the development of highly reliable blockchain P2P networking protocols.
