## Abstract
This talk will provide an overview of attribute-based access control (ABAC). The ongoing transition from rights-based to attribute-based authorization offers numerous compelling benefits. Decisions about user, subject, object, and context attributes can be made relatively independently, with appropriate decentralization for each attribute. Security architects can formulate policies to translate these attributes into rights. Dynamic elements can be incorporated into these policies, enabling access control decisions to adapt automatically to changing local and global circumstances.

On the positive side, this shift represents a maturation of authorization that aligns with the needs of emerging cyber technologies and systems. However, there are also risks. Devolving attribute management may lead to attributes of questionable provenance and value, potentially opening new channels for social engineering and malware attacks. We argue that the potential benefits will drive the widespread adoption of ABAC and, more broadly, attribute-based security. The cybersecurity research community has a responsibility to develop models, theories, and systems that ensure the safe and chaos-free deployment of ABAC. This is a current grand challenge.

## Bio
Ravi Sandhu is the Executive Director of the Institute for Cyber Security at the University of Texas at San Antonio, where he holds the Lutcher Brown Endowed Chair in Cyber Security. Previously, he served on the faculty at George Mason University (1989-2007) and Ohio State University (1982-1989). He holds BTech and MTech degrees from IIT Bombay and Delhi, and MS and PhD degrees from Rutgers University. 

Dr. Sandhu is a Fellow of IEEE, ACM, and AAAS, and has received awards from IEEE, ACM, NSA, and NIST. A prolific and highly cited author, his research has been funded by NSF, NSA, NIST, DARPA, AFOSR, ONR, AFRL, and private industry. His seminal papers on role-based access control established it as the dominant form of access control in practical systems. His numerous other models and mechanisms have also had significant real-world impact.

He served as Editor-in-Chief of *IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing* and previously as founding Editor-in-Chief of *ACM Transactions on Information and System Security*. He was Chairman of ACM SIGSAC and founded the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, the ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies, and the ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy. He has served as General Chair, Steering Committee Chair, Program Chair, and Committee Member for numerous security conferences. Dr. Sandhu has consulted for leading industry and government organizations and has lectured worldwide. He is an inventor on 30 security technology patents and has accumulated over 28,000 Google Scholar citations for his papers.

At the Institute for Cyber Security, his research projects include attribute-based access control, secure cloud computing, secure information sharing, social computing security, and secure data provenance.
