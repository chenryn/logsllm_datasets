I am developing a Python application that will run in an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment. For the purposes of error handling and debugging, I am writing logs to a custom log file located in the `/var/logs/` directory.

What steps should I take to be able to view and snapshot these log files from the Elastic Beanstalk management console?

To enable the ability to view and snapshot your log files directly from the Elastic Beanstalk management console, you should write your log files to the `/opt/python/log/` directory. This is the default directory used by Elastic Beanstalk for log tailing and management. By placing your logs in this directory, they will be accessible through the Elastic Beanstalk management console, allowing you to easily monitor and snapshot them.
