### Integration and Enhancement of the QoS Model

We have integrated a new property, interoperability, into an already well-structured Quality of Service (QoS) model. This property holds significant importance in the context of process complexity analysis (Cardoso et al., 2004).

#### Empirical Validation of the CFC Metric

To demonstrate that our Control-Flow Complexity (CFC) metric serves its intended purpose, we conducted an empirical validation through a controlled experiment. The experiment involved 19 graduate students in Computer Science as part of a research project. We tested whether the control-flow complexity of a set of 22 business processes could be accurately predicted using the CFC metric.

By analyzing the collected data with statistical methods, we concluded that the CFC metric is highly correlated with the control-flow complexity of processes. Therefore, this metric can be used by business process analysts and designers to evaluate and potentially simplify process complexity.
