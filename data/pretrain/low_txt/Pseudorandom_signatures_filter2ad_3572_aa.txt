**Abstract:**
We develop a three-level hierarchy of privacy notions for (unforgeable) digital signature schemes. We first prove the mutual independence of existing notions of anonymity and confidentiality, and then show that these are implied by higher privacy goals. The top notion in our hierarchy is pseudorandomness: signatures with this property hide all information about the signing process and cannot be recognized as signatures when transmitted over a public network. This implies very strong unlinkability guarantees across different signers and even different signing algorithms, and gives rise to new forms of private public-key authentication.

We show that one way to achieve pseudorandom signatures is through our mid-level notion, called indistinguishability: such signatures can be simulated using only the public parameters of the scheme. As we reveal, indistinguishable signatures exist in different cryptographic settings (e.g., based on RSA, discrete logarithms, pairings) and can be efficiently lifted to pseudorandomness using general transformations with appropriate encoding techniques. We also examine a more direct method for obtaining pseudorandomness for any unforgeable signature scheme. All our transformations work in the standard model, maintaining public verifiability of signatures in the setting of system-wide known public keys. Some results even hold if signing keys are disclosed to the adversary, provided that signed messages have high entropy.

## 1. Introduction

A digital signature \(\sigma\) on a message \(m\) is generated using a private key \(sk\) and verified with respect to the corresponding public key \(pk\). Digital signatures should be unforgeable and provide authenticity and integrity of signed messages. However, with the advent of public key infrastructures (PKIs), digital signatures have been criticized for threatening user privacy [19]. For instance, with system-wide known (PKI-certified) public keys and the public verifiability of signatures, any transmission of \((m, \sigma)\) over a public network implicitly reveals the identity of the signer to all intermediate parties, not just the intended recipients/verifiers.

To address this, we can restrict the amount of publicly available information about the message \(m\). Messages might be delivered through a different communication channel or at a different time, remaining out of reach of adversaries who obtain signatures and public keys. Additionally, verifiers might expect signatures on messages that need not be transmitted, such as private outputs computed with secure multi-party computation techniques or in (anonymous) key exchange protocols.

### Current Privacy Notions and Open Issues

Privacy of digital signatures, where signatures \(\sigma\) are revealed but associated messages \(m\) are not disclosed, has been addressed in definitions and security models of anonymous signatures by Yang et al. [28] and Fischlin [17], and in the notion of confidential signatures by Dent et al. [16]. These schemes aim to either hide the identities/public keys of signers (anonymity) or the content of signed messages (confidentiality). Both privacy notions were defined for high-entropy message spaces, which is necessary given the system-wide knowledge of public keys and signatures. This raises questions about the relationship between anonymity and confidentiality and the limits of privacy achievable with traditional signature schemes. We provide answers to many such questions.

### Pseudorandom Signatures and Applications

The most interesting question regarding the privacy of signature schemes is whether signatures can appear completely random to observers. This property would repel the attention of intermediate parties performing traffic analysis, as they could not determine whether a given datagram represents a valuable signature or not. Moreover, signatures that cannot be distinguished from random strings also hide which signing algorithm the signer used, which is often sufficient to identify signers.

For example, in the new European travel documents, the selection of specific (elliptic curve) parameters is the priority of respective states [9]. Many banks and health insurance companies issue smart cards to their customers, initialized with different signing algorithms and parameters. Distinguishing among different settings, implementations, or instantiations of the same signature scheme \(S\) can be seen as a privacy problem, e.g., if signatures can be used to derive the citizenship or customer relationship of the signer. If different signature schemes \(S_1, S_2, \ldots\) output signatures \(\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots\) of fixed length \(L\) that look random to observers, then \(\sigma_i\) would hide the applied scheme \(S_i\), and only the possession of \(m\) and (the expected signer's) \(pk\) would allow verification. Any other party, even with knowledge of the keys of the whole system, would remain clueless whether \(\sigma_i\) represents a signature and, if so, which signing algorithm was used.

Furthermore, pseudorandom signatures enable covert public-key authentication, offering cryptographic protection to covert channels. With pseudorandom signatures, it would be possible to perform public-key authentication and execute authenticated key exchange over covert channels without losing covertness. For example, parties could run an unauthenticated key exchange protocol with random-looking messages (e.g., using the Diffie-Hellman approach) and then exchange pseudorandom signatures on the protocol transcript and an additional high-entropy confirmation token derived from the established shared key material. Since all exchanged messages are random-looking, the established secure channel would remain covert. If pseudorandomness of signatures is preserved even if the signing key \(sk\) is leaked, the protocol would guarantee 'forward covertness' (akin to forward secrecy, e.g., [13]). Pseudorandom signatures offer strong and useful privacy guarantees in communication protocols and applications where authentication should remain unobservable by traffic analysis [22].

## 1.1 Our Results and Techniques

### Privacy Hierarchy for Digital Signatures

We develop a three-level hierarchy of privacy notions for digital signatures, starting with the investigation of the relationship between anonymity and confidentiality. Definitions of anonymity were first given by Yang et al. [28], with later refinements by Fischlin [17]. These definitions presume messages with high entropy. For confidentiality, we use the original definitions by Dent et al. [16] (in its strongest variant). We show that anonymous signatures and confidential signatures are independent privacy notions. Therefore, anonymity (ANON) and confidentiality (CONF) are located at the lowest level of our privacy hierarchy.

At the mid-level, we have indistinguishability (IND), expressing that signatures can be simulated from the public parameters of the scheme. We prove that such signatures offer stronger privacy guarantees than purely anonymous and purely confidential schemes. In particular, any transmission of an IND signature simultaneously hides both the signer and the associated message. The IND property is a generalization of both ANON and CONF and is sufficient for obtaining privacy in anticipated applications of both schemes. IND signatures may, however, leak some recognizable structure about the signature scheme in use.

The strongest privacy notion in our arsenal lets signatures appear as (structureless) strings of random bits, termed pseudorandom (PR). We show why this property is sufficient to hide all information about the signing process, including the signature scheme itself. The introduced privacy hierarchy, with the intuitively strongest notion of pseudorandomness on top, is likely to close the subject of privacy-preserving signatures.

Each of our privacy notions is defined in two variants, reflecting that adversaries might or might not have a copy of the signing key. That is, we also address security with full key exposure (FKE), which has been formalized for anonymous schemes by Fischlin [17]. In our privacy hierarchy, we further distinguish between probabilistic and deterministic schemes. We show that with full key exposure, obtaining any form of privacy for deterministic schemes is hopeless.

### Constructions and Transformations

For a selection of existing signature schemes, we investigate indistinguishability and pseudorandomness properties and, where appropriate, propose modifications and generic transformations to achieve these goals. We build privacy-preserving signatures in three different cryptographic settings: using RSA parameters (e.g., FDH-RSA [4]), using cyclic prime-order groups (e.g., Schnorr’s scheme [25]), and using pairings (e.g., Boneh-Boyen [5]).

#### Indistinguishable Signatures

We formalize the notion of information-recovering signatures (as a generalization of the known concept of 'message recovery') and discuss its negative impact on confidentiality, and hence on indistinguishability and pseudorandomness. We show that not only known message-recovering schemes (e.g., 'text-book' RSA and Nyberg-Rueppel [21], together with their 'hash-then-sign'-based transformations), but also several other schemes (in different cryptographic contexts) fall under our more general notion of 'information recovery' and thus do not offer indistinguishability. Examples include schemes by Cramer and Shoup (CS) [15], Camenisch and Lysyanskaya (CL) [11], and Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham (BLS) [7].

We then focus on three cryptographic settings—RSA, discrete logarithms (DL), and pairings—and provide examples of indistinguishable schemes. In particular, we show that, using appropriate randomization and padding techniques, FDH-RSA becomes indistinguishable. In the DL setting, we prove that the (generalized) signature scheme by Schnorr [25] offers indistinguishability 'off the shelf', assuming that its cyclic group is shared among all signers. We note that anonymity of FDH-RSA and Schnorr’s schemes was previously analyzed in [28], and their confidentiality in [16]. Our analysis shows that both schemes admit much stronger privacy guarantees. Finally, we prove that the pairing-based Boneh-Boyen (BB) [5] scheme is indistinguishable in the standard model, yet for uniformly distributed (fixed-length) messages only. As suggested in [5], the 'hash-then-sign' approach can be used in the standard model to sign longer messages. We show that in the random oracle model, this method readily offers indistinguishability for arbitrary long high-entropy messages. We note that indistinguishability of all analyzed schemes holds in the presence of full key exposure (FKE).

#### Pseudorandom Signatures

Pseudorandom signatures, which cannot be distinguished from random bit strings of the same length, offer the highest form of privacy that signatures can provide.

Our first result on PR signatures is a generic transformation that strengthens IND signatures to obtain the PR property (we call it IND-to-PR compiler in Table 1). It uses admissible encodings, introduced in a different context by Boneh and Franklin [6] for elliptic curves, generalized later by Brier et al. [8], and also used to preserve privacy in the password-based authentication protocol by Bringer, Chabanne, and Icart [9]. By finding appropriate admissible encodings for different types of sets, we can immediately obtain the PR property for the IND versions of FDH-RSA, Schnorr, and BB schemes. We also prove that the obtained PR property holds in the presence of full key exposure.

Our next result is a second generic transformation that achieves the PR property directly for any (unforgeable) digital signature scheme. This PR compiler is powerful enough to guarantee the PR property also for information-recovering schemes and works irrespective of whether the original scheme is probabilistic or deterministic.
