### Impact of Noise on Query Performance

The impact of noise becomes even more pronounced when the researcher submits only 1,000 queries. On an unprotected methylation Beacon, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) remains approximately the same. However, with SVT2-protected MBeacon, the researcher cannot obtain reliable answers. This highlights the trade-off introduced by SVT2 protection: a higher number of queries is required to achieve similar performance.

### Threshold T = 3

Next, we increase the threshold to T = 3, while keeping the budget \( c \) and privacy level \( \epsilon \) constant. This allows us to study the influence of the increased threshold. Figure 4 shows the results, indicating a slight overall decrease in performance. The decrease is even smaller for T = 2, which we do not show here due to space constraints. A threshold greater than T = 3 would likely be unacceptable to researchers given the size of the MBeacon, so we did not experiment with higher thresholds.

### Setting the Parameters

The above results demonstrate that the threshold and other privacy parameters must be chosen based on the specific use case to maximize utility and minimize privacy loss. We believe our general method of parameter tuning, which involves setting a budget \( c \) that is not exceeded, then adjusting \( \epsilon \) based on the performance of both attackers and researchers, and increasing or decreasing \( c \) as needed, provides a good balance between utility and privacy for any dataset and MBeacon size.

### Prototype Implementation

We have implemented a fully functional prototype of our MBeacon system, accessible at [https://mbeacon-network.github.io/MBeacon-network/](https://mbeacon-network.github.io/MBeacon-network/). Our prototype is built using the same algorithms as in our experiments. The implementation is done in Python, utilizing packages such as Pandas, Numpy, and Scipy. We use Flask to build the web frontend, allowing seamless integration with the backend to form a centralized service.

The backend of our prototype is responsible for querying the datasets and returning the MBeacon output after applying SVT2. It takes a CpG identifier and the methylation value at that position as input. Upon receiving a query, the MBeacon system returns all institutions that have the corresponding data.

In the future, we envision our prototype running in a decentralized manner, with each data provider operating their own MBeacon service. In this scenario, the centralized service would only provide the frontend.

### Related Work

Homer et al. [16] were among the first to perform a membership inference attack on genomic data. They used summary statistics as background knowledge and the L1 distance to measure similarity. Sankararaman et al. [32] improved Homer’s attack by incorporating the likelihood ratio (LR) test. More recently, Backes et al. [5] demonstrated that membership inference attacks can also be performed on epigenetic data, such as microRNA. These threats necessitate considering privacy when sharing biomedical data, often delaying the process for researchers.

In response, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) established the Beacon system [10] to facilitate genomic data sharing.

#### Attacks on Genomic Beacons

Shringarpure and Bustamante [36] showed that even with binary responses, it is possible to infer whether a patient is in a Beacon using the LR test. Their attack does not depend on allele frequencies but on the more stable allele distribution. While they studied the influence of several factors on the attack's effectiveness, they did not propose feasible solutions for a privacy-preserving genomic Beacon.

Raisaro et al. [29] extended the attack in [36] by adopting a sophisticated selection strategy, where the attacker has direct access to allele frequencies and selects the most informative positions to query first. This setup serves as a blueprint for our attack against MBeacons.

The authors of [44] proposed an attack using correlations between different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to infer missing or hidden alleles. This reduces the number of queries needed for strong confidence and renders privacy mechanisms based on hiding low-frequency SNPs ineffective. However, such correlations are not well-studied in DNA methylation, so we plan to explore this in future work.

#### Privacy Protection for Beacons

Raisaro et al. [29] proposed three protection mechanisms and experimentally showed their effectiveness. However, they did not provide formal guarantees. Wan et al. [45] further analyzed these mechanisms and proposed a new one, empirically evaluating utility, privacy, and effectiveness under various settings.

Al Aziz et al. [1] proposed two additional privacy protection mechanisms, one of which, the biased randomized response, is proven to be differentially private. They also analyzed how the decision boundary for membership relates to the number of queries and patients in the Beacon.

To the best of our knowledge, existing attacks are conducted on genomic Beacons, and we propose the first membership inference attack on Beacons with DNA methylation data. By simulating legitimate and adversarial behavior, we believe our utility measures provide a more realistic picture. The privacy and utility measures we propose are not limited to MBeacons and can be applied to other types of biomedical data.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we propose the first Beacon system for sharing DNA methylation data, the MBeacon system. Due to the severe privacy risks associated with DNA methylation data, our construction follows a privacy-by-design approach.

We first illustrate the severe privacy risks by conducting a membership inference attack based on the LR test. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that with 100 queries, the adversary can achieve superior performance. We then propose a defense mechanism, SVT2, to implement our privacy-preserving MBeacon. SVT2 is an advanced version of the sparse vector technique, and we theoretically prove its differential privacy. Since the goal of MBeacon is to facilitate biomedical data sharing, we propose a new metric for measuring researchers' utility in a realistic scenario.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with carefully chosen parameters, MBeacon can significantly degrade the performance of membership inference attacks without substantially hurting the researchers' utility.

### Future Work

We plan to extend the Beacon-style system to other types of biomedical data, such as gene expression, microRNA, or laboratory tests. This will require adapting the estimate of the general population accordingly. Additionally, we aim to extend the Beacon system to support multiple-position queries, which should improve utility for researchers but will also raise new privacy challenges.
