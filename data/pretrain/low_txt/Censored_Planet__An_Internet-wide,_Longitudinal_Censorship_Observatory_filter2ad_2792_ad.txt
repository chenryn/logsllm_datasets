### 3.2 Net-Censorship Trends
Net-censorship remained unusually high through April and spiked again in the week of May 12, 2019. This contrasts with most reports claiming that the social media ban was lifted by May 1st [3, 70]. Our observations highlight the importance of continuous and repetitive longitudinal measurements.

### 7.1.2 Uncovering New Events: DNS Blocking in Norway
Norway is ranked #1 (Most Free) in the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index [88]. However, recent laws passed in the country encourage the blocking of websites featuring gambling and pornography [23, 40], leading ISPs to perform DNS blocking [23, 60]. Our anomaly detection alerted us to high scores in DNS blocking from December 2019 until March 2020 (cf. Table 1).

Censored Planet data reveals extremely aggressive DNS blocking of many domains in Norway, with consistent blocks across all vantage points. During the four-month period, 25 ASes observed blocking of more than 10 domains in at least six categories. The most rigorous activity was observed in AS 2116 (CATCHCOM), where more than 50 domains were blocked. The large number of categories being targeted shows that ISPs in Norway are not only restricting pornography and gambling websites, as previously thought. The most blocked domains included search engines (163.com), online dating sites (match.com), and the website of the Human Rights Watch (hrw.org). The DNS blocking in Norway also shows a highly increasing trend from the beginning of our measurements, underscoring the importance of measurements in countries previously thought to be free.

### 7.2 Trend Analysis
In this section, we discuss some primary findings from our trend analysis of censorship data.

#### 7.2.1 Trends in Methods
We consider the trends in censorship methods. Our key findings are as follows (cf. Figure 8):

- **DNS Censorship**: Heavily used in countries like Iran (slope - 0.048), China (slope - 0.93), and Russia (slope - 0.003) due to the ease of blocking [8, 9, 38, 41, 78, 85]. Recent reports suggest the export of their censorship models to more than 100 countries [108], including Turkmenistan (slope - 0.15). We observe an overall increase in DNS censorship in 123 countries.
- **HTTPS Censorship**: Also observed an increasing trend. Fully encrypted traffic has been cited as the reason for decreasing censorship in the past [7], but new methods for blocking fully encrypted traffic lead to an increasing number of countries with higher blocking [100]. Uzbekistan (slope - 0.041) shows the most increasing HTTPS censorship.
- **Discard Censorship**: Measures censorship in one direction (Measurement machine → Vantage Point). An increase in observed rates indicates blocking independent of the direction of measurement [100, 106]. Portugal (slope - 0.045) has shown a high increase in Discard censorship.

The increasing trend in multiple censorship methods encourages diverse measurements and highlights the importance of a unified platform measuring censorship on multiple protocols synchronously.

#### 7.2.2 Trends in Domains
We analyze trends in the categories of domains blocked to find whether some types of content are more increasingly blocked than others:

- **News Media Censorship**: Shows a surprising upward trend. The countries with the highest increase in news censorship include Pakistan and Albania.
- **Benign Categories**: Such as gaming, media sharing, and hosting and blogging platforms, also experience an upward trend in addition to sensitive topics like provocative attire and human rights issues.

The increasing trend in blocking benign categories highlights the importance of repetitively testing all types of content for a comprehensive picture of global censorship.

### 7.2.3 Freedom on the Net Report
The annual Freedom on the Net Report provides a qualitative ranking of countries in three categories (Free, Partly Free, Not Free) [46]. The quantitative results of Censored Planet extend the insights of this report by significantly increasing the number of countries covered and providing concrete results on the extent of access limitations. For example, the 2019 Freedom on the Net report covers only 65 countries, which is around 28% of the countries tested by Censored Planet. We apply our trend and censorship analysis to the Freedom House categories (cf. Figure 9):

- **Not Free Countries**: Have the highest censorship rates, mainly caused by the restrictive policies of Iran and China [9, 38]. Our results confirm the qualitative assessment.
- **Free Countries**: Show an upward trend in censorship. Examples include Australia and the United Kingdom [12, 63].
- **Not Considered Countries**: Also show a non-negligible amount of censorship and a comparatively more upward trend, suggesting that the scale of Censored Planet can complement manually-compiled reports significantly.

### 7.3 Case Study: Turkmenistan
Turkmenistan, a country ramping up its censorship at an alarming rate, is ranked second-to-worst in the 2019 Reporters without Borders Press Freedom Index [89] and was recently in the limelight for censoring media regarding the COVID-19 pandemic [72, 87]. In mid-April 2020, we received requests from a major circumvention tool to investigate suspected IP blocking of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) servers used by its system in Turkmenistan. One of these DoH servers was operated by Cloudflare, and since any Cloudflare IP allows users to reach its DoH service, we suspected that all Cloudflare IP addresses were being blocked, which would restrict access to a wide range of services.

We used Censored Planet’s rapid focus capabilities to run custom Augur measurements in Turkmenistan on April 17, 2020, testing the reachability to 15 IPs (including the DoH services and Cloudflare IPs [28]) from 34 vantage points. Our results confirmed that all tested Cloudflare IPs were blocked in at least 18 vantage points. We found interference in both directions of communication (inbound on anycasted IPs, outbound on non-anycasted IPs), primarily taking place in the state-owned AS 20661 (TURKMENTELECOM-AS), affecting more than 90% of the public IP address space in Turkmenistan [35].

In addition to the Cloudflare IPs, the DoH server hosted by Snopyta, a non-profit service provider, was also blocked. This rapid focus case study demonstrates the ability of Censored Planet to run custom measurements or increase scale when investigating censorship events.

### 8. Related Work
An abundance of work in censorship has focused on exploring censorship policies in specific countries, either using volunteers or accessible vantage points inside the country. The Great Firewall of China and Iran’s censorship regime are two of the most studied censorship phenomena [8, 9, 13, 26, 30, 38, 61, 113, 116, 121]. Recent increases in censorship in other countries have also prompted focused studies, such as in Russia [84, 85], Thailand [47], India [118], and others [6, 25, 52, 65, 81]. There has also been a long line of work on measuring Internet shutdowns, which have been increasing in many countries [31, 53, 96, 112].

Censorship measurement platforms that focus on coverage in multiple countries have also been proposed. In addition to ICLab [7] and OONI [104], there are other platforms that have been active in the past, but few are still active and collect longitudinal data. Encore [20] induced web clients around the world to perform cross-origin requests when users visit certain websites, and the approach has spurred a long line of discussion on the ethics of censorship measurement [34, 56, 76, 106]. The OpenNet Initiative (ONI) [73] published several reports on Internet censorship in different countries before becoming defunct in 2011 [74, 75]. UBICA [4] and CensMon [95] used distributed PlanetLab nodes [80] and volunteer deployments to perform censorship measurements in different countries but have not been used longitudinally.

An important component of these censorship measurement studies is the test list of URLs, and several studies have focused on generating an optimal list of domains for testing [27, 92, 110]. The literature on censorship circumvention is also rich with work on both long-standing systems such as Tor [33] and newer systems using packet manipulation strategies [18, 83, 107], crowdsourcing [67], and strategies to disguise the destination [42, 49, 114, 115].

### 9. Limitations and Future Work
Like the remote measurement techniques on which our data is based, Censored Planet has a few inherent limitations. Even with our large global coverage, our vantage points are not fine-grained enough to measure every local instance of censorship, especially those applied very close to end-users, such as in schools or workplaces. Some of the remote measurement techniques have more specific technical limitations: some cannot detect unidirectional blocking (Hyperquack, Quack-Discard) or blocking of domains that normally are anycasted (Augur), though we note that recent studies have claimed that it is challenging for censors to block network traffic in a specific direction, especially at the national level [77, 100, 106]. Finally, like all previous work [77, 78, 104, 106], we use off-the-shelf geolocation databases that are known to sometimes be inaccurate. We have used independent data sources to confirm location accuracy in particularly critical case studies.

We are aware that a sophisticated censor might attempt to block or evade our techniques, maybe by detecting and dropping traffic from our machines or by poisoning probe responses with misleading data. Due to our control measurements (e.g., testing for benign domains and tracking changes in each network’s behavior over time and across multiple vantage points), Censored Planet can avoid some of these countermeasures, but not all of them. So far, we have no reason to believe that any country or network has engaged in active evasion of Censored Planet measurements to hide censorship, although a few small network prefixes have blacklisted our probe traffic.

While Censored Planet provides a powerful platform for understanding censorship phenomena, fully leveraging the data will require much additional work, including collaboration with in-country experts and researchers from the social and political sciences and other domains. Further application of methods such as machine learning and data visualization will undoubtedly expose more insights from the data. All of these represent opportunities for future collaboration, both inside and outside computer science, and are exciting avenues to explore. Our roadmap includes several features that we hope will facilitate such collaborations. We are building a Censored Planet search interface and API that provides interactive queries and integration with other platforms.

### 10. Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced Censored Planet, a global censorship observatory that overcomes the scale, coverage, and continuity limitations of existing platforms. Using multiple remote measurement techniques, Censored Planet has collected more than 21 billion data points over 20 months of operation. We built representative metrics and time series analysis techniques to discover 15 key censorship events and analyze trends in censorship methods and censored content, and we used Censored Planet’s rapid focus capabilities for case studies of particular censorship events. We hope that Censored Planet can enhance Internet freedom by helping to bring transparency to censorship practices and supporting research, tool development, and advocacy that seeks to protect the human rights of Internet users around the world.
