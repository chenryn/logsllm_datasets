### 5. Countermeasures

In this section, we present two countermeasures against the attacks we have developed. Specifically, we propose different approaches to address both the denial of service (DoS) and mobile-terminated (MT) service hijacking issues. A comprehensive solution is required to simultaneously resolve both problems. Unlike the second prevention strategy, which addresses each issue separately, the first solution resolves both issues at once but requires a protocol change.

#### First Solution: Protocol Change in Paging Procedure

For the first solution, we propose modifying the paging protocol procedure [4]. The current authentication process involves the network sending a 128-bit random challenge (RAND) to the subscriber. Using the secret key \( K_i \), which is stored only on the SIM card or in the authentication center of the network, the subscriber computes a 32-bit response value (SRES) using the A3 algorithm. This SRES value is then sent back to the network. The operator network also computes SRES based on \( K_i \) stored in the authentication center. If both SRES values match, the subscriber is successfully authenticated to the network. However, as mandated in the GSM specification, this authentication occurs after the paging response is processed. The same principle applies to UMTS [12]. Therefore, the paging response itself is not authenticated.

By adapting the protocol to include the RAND value in the paging request and SRES in the paging response, all paging responses can be authenticated. This eliminates session hijacking. Additionally, a paging response that includes authentication information can be used by the network to validate the response before changing the state to no longer expect further paging responses, thus mitigating the DoS attack. It is crucial to note that this requires a fresh RAND for every authentication to prevent replay attacks.

This protocol change is similar to the one proposed by Arapinis et al. [16], which encrypts the paging request using a shared session key called the unlinkability key. While they use this key to prevent tracking of subscribers via IMSI paging, the same modification also prevents the attacks described in this paper. Unfortunately, the industry is reluctant to apply new protocol changes to commercially deployed networks, partly due to the difficulty of updating devices in the field.

#### Second Solution: No Protocol Change, Individual Problem Resolution

The second solution does not require a protocol change but addresses each problem individually. To mitigate MT session hijacking, we enforce authentication for each service request. This approach also overcomes mobile-originated (MO) session hijacking. To eliminate the DoS attack, the Mobile Switching Center/Visitor Location Register (MSC/VLR) state machine needs to be modified. Specifically, the MSC/VLR must be able to map all incoming paging responses to the correct service as long as no fully authenticated session exists. This circumvents the DoS attack.

### 6. Related Work

In recent years, various attacks against cellular networks and their protocol stacks have been published. We categorize related work into two parts: attacks that allow an adversary to impersonate a victim and DoS attacks in mobile networks that result in customers being unable to receive MT services.

#### Impersonation

Nohl and Melette [28] demonstrated that it is possible to impersonate a subscriber for mobile-originated services by sniffing a transaction over-the-air, cracking the session key \( K_c \), and knowing the victim's Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI). They were able to place a phone call on behalf of the victim. The authors of [24] used a femtocell device under their control to impersonate a subscriber booked into the femtocell. By relaying authentication challenges to the victim, they were able to send SMS messages on behalf of the subscriber.

Our work differs as we do not attack MO services but focus on MT services. In our research, the victim is, for example, the called party rather than the caller. Unlike attacking MO services, attacking MT services is time-critical.

#### Denial of Service

We consider relevant types of DoS attacks in mobile networks that affect MT services for subscribers. We identified three types of DoS attacks that meet this requirement: attacks directly targeting the victim's phone, attacks focusing on the network, and attacks affecting subscribers without direct communication.

1. **Direct Device Attacks**: These DoS attacks target mobile devices, often caused by implementation flaws. For example, the "Curse-of-Silence" flaw [44] allowed an adversary to disable the MT SMS functionality of specific Nokia devices. Racic et al. [38] demonstrated that it is possible to stealthily exhaust mobile phone batteries by repeatedly sending crafted MMS messages to a victim. Our attack is inherently different because it is independent of the target device type and does not interact with the victim directly.

2. **Network Targeted Attacks**: These attacks target the operator, impacting MT services for subscribers. Spaar [43] showed that it is feasible to exhaust channel resources of a base station by continuously requesting new channels on the Random Access Channel (RACH). Enck et al. [21] demonstrated that it is practical to deny voice or SMS services within a specific geographical area by sending a large number of short messages to subscribers in that area. Serror et al. [42] exhibited similar conditions in CDMA2000 networks, causing significant paging load and delay via Internet-originating packets. Lee et al. [32] demonstrated a comparable resource consumption attack for 3G/WiMax. Traynor et al. [36] outlined how a phone botnet could degrade the performance of large networks by repeatedly adding and deleting call forwarding settings. These attacks exhaust network resources due to generated signaling load, effectively causing DoS conditions. Our attack exploits a race condition in the MT paging procedure and does not generate excessive signaling traffic, making it distinct from these attacks.

3. **Indirect Device Attacks**: These attacks target the mobile device without sending any payload to it. The IMSI detach attack discovered by Munaut [34] can cause a service such as a call to no longer result in paging requests by the network. As described in Section 4.4, this design flaw supports our attack. Contrary to this vulnerability, the paging response attack allows us to precisely control when and where a victim can be reached or not. After sending a detach indication, an attacker cannot control how long this state is maintained.

Our approach can be used to either hijack a session or perform a DoS attack. We target mobile stations without exhausting network resources or directly communicating with the target device. We can target specific geographical areas, specific subscribers, or a group of subscribers without needing a hit list of phone numbers. Depending on the target, the attack can be distributed or performed from a single phone. The costs involved are minimal, equivalent to acquiring the required number of Motorola C1XX phones.

### 7. Conclusion

The trust in the security of cellular networks, particularly the widely used GSM standard, has been repeatedly compromised. Yet, attacks against mobile-terminated services remain a minority. The undisturbed operation of telecommunication networks traditionally relies on the inherent trust that each subscriber and participant plays by the rules. However, with the availability of modifiable software and hardware projects for telecommunications, this trust relationship is broken. In this paper, we demonstrated how to exploit the trust in paging procedures on a broadcast medium. We showed that it is possible to leverage a race condition in the paging protocol to conduct a novel DoS attack and hijack MT services in GSM. This attack can not only disrupt communication for individual subscribers but also significantly affect telephony in larger geographical regions. A motivated attacker can interrupt communication on a large scale using inexpensive consumer devices, which is more efficient than traditional radio jamming due to the broad frequency range of mobile carrier networks and the size of location areas. To mitigate these attacks, we propose two countermeasures, one of which does not require a protocol change. We strongly encourage future standards to consider threats posed by active attackers who tamper with user equipment and protocol stacks.
