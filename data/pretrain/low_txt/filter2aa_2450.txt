## Tor: The Onion Router
- **Primary Purpose:** Anonymize internet activity
- **Functionality:** Uses a series of routers that forward traffic anonymously. Each router only knows about one hop in either direction.
- **Caution:** Using Tor may classify you as an "extremist" in the eyes of the NSA, but this is a common concern with many privacy tools.

### Connecting to the Tor Network
- **CLI Daemon:**
  - `apt-get install tor`
  - Configure `/etc/tor/torrc` and `/etc/tor/tor-tsocks.conf`
  - Start the daemon: `/etc/init.d/tor start`
  - Point your browser to port 9050
  - Confirm connection: `http://check.torproject.org`

- **Tor Browser:**
  - Download from: https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en
  - Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - Run the executable to launch a portable Firefox browser with select plugins

### Tails: A Live Linux Distro for Anonymity
- **Features:**
  - Forces all traffic through Tor
  - Does not touch the hard disk (without additional configuration)
  - Can disguise the UI as Windows XP to avoid suspicion
  - Comes with pre-installed software like HTTPS Everywhere, OpenPGP, Pidgin OTR, TrueCrypt, and KeePassX
- **Caution:** Similar to Tor, using Tails may raise flags with surveillance agencies.

## What to Do Once Connected
- Browse the internet anonymously
- Tunnel out of restricted networks
- Fight censorship
- Criticize government and officials
- Stay anonymous
- Use Tor Hidden Services

### Tor Hidden Services
- **Definition:** Services that exist only within the Tor network
- **Domain:** `.onion` as the top-level domain
- **Resources:**
  - Hidden Wiki: http://zqktlwi4fecvo6ri.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
  - Torfind: http://ndj6p3asftxboa7j.onion/
  - TorSearch: http://kbhpodhnfxl3clb4.onion/
  - Grams: http://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/ (Google-like search for the Tor darknet)

### Sites of Interest
- **The Pirate Bay:** http://jntlesnev5o7zysa.onion/
  - Caution: Bittorrent client must go through Tor
- **Assassination Market:** http://www.assmkedzgorodn7o.onion/ (Crowd-funded assassinations)
- **Rent-A-Hacker:** http://2ogmrlfzdthnwkez.onion/

### Hacker Forums

  - Trading CCs, CVVs, identities
  - Basic hacking info
  - Access requires a ~$50 purchase: http://6oa276dur6udwykp.onion/
- **Intel Exchange:**
  - Mostly trolling, some decent information: http://rrcc5uuudhh4oz3c.onion

  - Silkroad 2: http://silkroad6ownowfk.onion/
  - Agora: http://agorahooawayyfoe.onion
  - Evolution: http://k5zq47j6wd3wdvjq.onion (Our current favorite)

### Carding Sites/Forums
- **Tor Carding Forums (TCF):** http://6oa276dur6udwykp.onion
  - Requires ~$50 purchase for access
- **CC:** http://carding2bil6j7ja.onion/cc

### Fake IDs
- **Fake US Drivers Licenses:**
  - Scannable, holograms, UV: http://en35tuzqmn4lofbk.onion/
- **Fake Passports/Drivers Licenses:**
  - http://fakeidscpc4zz6c4.onion/
- **Fake Passports:**
  - http://fakepasvv3holddd.onion/
- **Reddit (not on Tor, but useful):** /r/fakeid

### Bitcoin
- **Overview:**
  - Online cryptocurrency
  - Digital wallet setup (local or web-based; local recommended)
  - Transactions are logged in a global ledger maintained by a P2P network
  - Relies on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for authentication

- **Tumbling/Mixing:**
  - Process of anonymizing Bitcoin usage
  - Many parties put coins into a communal pool, which then distributes them to different wallets
  - You get back the same amount of coins minus a fee

### Considerations for Tor and Bitcoin
- **Tor:**
  - Can reveal true identity through correlation attacks or browser exploits
- **Bitcoin:**
  - Not fully anonymous; blockchain is public
  - Use tumbling services to obfuscate the source of your bitcoins
  - Avoid withdrawing exactly the same amount you put in

### Operational Security (OPSEC)
- **Stay Updated:**
  - Follow the Tor Blog: https://blog.torproject.org
  - Keep Tor/TorBrowser updated
  - Monitor the status of current markets (subreddit is a good resource)

- **Browser Segregation:**
  - Use separate browsers for social media and anonymous activities
  - Use a VM specifically for Tor connections (e.g., Tails)
  - Boot into a trusted OS for maximum security

- **Receiving Items:**
  - Use a PO Box or UPS Store
  - Wait a week or two to pick up items to avoid stakeouts

- **Identities:**
  - Don't reuse identities or passwords
  - Use disposable emails: http://www.sharklasers.com/ and https://www.guerrillamail.com/

- **Making Mailboxes More Anonymous:**
  - Purchase a mailbox
  - Buy a fake ID using the mailbox
  - Burn the mailbox and open a new one at a different location using the fake ID

### Parting Thoughts
- Darknets can be used for both "good" and "evil"
- These networks have legitimate purposes and are likely the future of online communication

### Shameless Self-Promotion
- Visit us at 801 Labs and DC801 events
- Follow us on Twitter: @dc801, @grifter801, and @metacortex
- Join us on IRC: #dc801 on the FreeNode network

### Appendix A: Bitcoin Mining
- **Process:**
  - Nodes group unconfirmed transactions into blocks
  - Blocks are difficult to create to prevent abuse
  - A nonce is appended to the block and hashed twice
  - Block hash must be less than the current network difficulty
  - Successful block submission to the blockchain earns a reward of 25 BTC

- **Evolution of Mining:**
  - From CPU to GPU to FPGA to ASIC
  - Current state: High network difficulty, mining pools are necessary
  - Unless using mid to high-end ASICs, mining is not profitable due to electricity costs

We hope this presentation provides valuable insights into the dark side of the internet and the importance of anonymity and security.
