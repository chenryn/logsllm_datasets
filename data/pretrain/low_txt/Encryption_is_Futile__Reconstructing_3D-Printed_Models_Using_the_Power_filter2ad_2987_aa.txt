## Abstract
Outsourced Additive Manufacturing (AM) exposes sensitive design data to external malicious actors. Even with end-to-end encryption between the design owner and the 3D printer, side-channel attacks can bypass cybersecurity measures and obtain the underlying design. In this paper, we develop a method based on the power side-channel that enables accurate design reconstruction in the face of full encryption measures without any prior knowledge of the design. Our evaluation on a Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D Printer has shown 99% accuracy in reconstruction, a significant improvement over the state of the art. This approach demonstrates the futility of pure cybersecurity measures applied to Additive Manufacturing.

## 1. Introduction
Additive Manufacturing (AM) has proven vulnerable to a variety of attacks. Given its high growth and value, cybersecurity defenses are regularly considered, especially in the private sector. However, in outsourced manufacturing, cross-domain (physical-to-cyber) attacks can circumvent pure cybersecurity measures. In this paper, we develop a side-channel attack to steal the design data of a manufactured object.

AM provides significant advantages over traditional manufacturing methods, such as production flexibility, reduced weight, complex geometries, and graded materials. Smaller manufacturers can also benefit, but are often hindered by high capital expenditure and specialized operational knowledge. Outsourcing business models have flourished to address this need, with world leaders including ThyssenKrupp AG TechCenter Additive Manufacturing (Germany), Akhani3D (South Africa), RapidDirect (China), and Treatstock (United States). While these manufacturers are reputable, not all will be trustworthy or safe from insider threats. A malicious AM service provider is uniquely positioned to steal technical data.

To address this threat, systems have been proposed offering Digital Rights Management (DRM) and adapting traditional cybersecurity for AM environments. For example, Oligshclaeger et al. [30] propose using cryptographic keys unique to a 3D printer for end-to-end encryption of designs. GE [19] proposes decrypting technical data using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) integrated into the 3D printer, limiting access to plaintext data and cryptographic keys. Several companies, such as Identify3D [24], offer commercial options that implement DRM and encryption.

Identify3D, in particular, addresses the distributed and outsourced manufacturing market, claiming to provide "intellectual property protection, manufacturing repeatability, and traceability" to "unlock the potential of distributed manufacturing" [25]. We believe these developments constitute a trend towards securing outsourced manufacturing via DRM, which will further boost the already growing sector. We examine a case where this technology is comprehensive and faultless, yet we seek to demonstrate that pure cybersecurity measures are not sufficient to protect IP against a malicious contract manufacturer.

Several publications have explored offensive or defensive reconstructions of AM IP using side-channels, including acoustic, electromagnetic (EM), visual, and inertial readings. We develop a novel approach to reconstruction utilizing the actuator current draw, a side-channel not previously used for this purpose. This side channel offers several advantages: the potential for perfect or near-perfect reconstruction, excellent portability to all classes of actuators, and a level of stealth that allows for multiple viable threat models.

### Threat Model
We assume a Man-at-the-End (MATE) threat model applied to outsourced AM. Comprehensive digital security measures, such as end-to-end encryption of the model and a TPM module on the 3D printer, are assumed to be in place. We assume that either the service provider itself is malicious, or it has a malicious insider employee with some access to the AM equipment. The intent of the malicious party is to reconstruct the customer’s 3D printed model. We assume they cannot compromise the cybersecurity measures but can instrument the 3D printer. Under this threat model, we develop an approach to capture and reconstruct the 3D printed model, bypassing cybersecurity measures entirely.

Overall, we contribute a significant evolution of the state of the art in reconstruction, a novel approach to collecting and interpreting AM actuator signals, and a demonstration of MATE attacks in AM circumventing defensive systems.

### Paper Structure
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 outlines our approach and the challenges involved. The approach is presented in pseudocode in Section 4. Section 5 explains our experimental evaluation and presents our results. We discuss the limitations of the approach in Section 6 and further topics in Section 7. Section 8 concludes the paper.

## 2. State of the Art
Multiple authors have surveyed the field of AM security. The theft of technical data emerged early in the field's development, with practical attacks published in 2016 by Do et al. [14] and Belikovetsky et al. [9] using cyber means to access design files. Most AM sabotage attacks, such as those by Sturm et al. [40], Belikovetsky et al. [9], and Zeltmann et al. [50], acquire and modify design files, implying a data theft attack as a prerequisite [20].

A variety of cybersecurity solutions have been proposed to respond to the threat of data theft in AM. Adkins et al.’s patent [2] describes a system applying encryption on a trusted device, and Safford et al. [35] propose a similar system with hardware based on TPM technology. These systems, while robust to cyber attacks, can often be circumvented with side-channel attacks.

Side-channels are a common vulnerability of embedded systems. They are the physical emanations of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), such as electromagnetics or sound, which can be correlated to the original processes. Classical approaches include Van Eck’s remote spying on Cathode Ray Tube displays by their emanations [43] and Koscher’s Simple and Differential Power Analysis for identifying encryption algorithms and cryptographic keys [26].

The first practical side-channel exploitation in AM was conducted by Al Faruque et al. [4] using acoustic emanations from the motors of a FDM 3D Printer. They achieved 78.35% accuracy in axis prediction and a 17.82% error in movement distance estimation. Hojjati et al. [22] and Song et al. [37] presented machine-learning-based reconstructions using the acoustic side-channel, relying on smartphone audio sensors. Gao et al. [17] made significant strides in reconstruction accuracy and metrics, using a multi-sensor suite of accelerometer, magnetometer, and camera to reconstruct the physical properties of toolpath, extrusion speed, layer thickness, and fan speed.

In response to published side-channel attacks, some authors have proposed methods to defend AM systems with side-channel techniques or to defend against them. Recent work by Yu, Chhetri, and Al-Faruque [49] made significant improvements to attack detection accuracy using a multi-modal approach. Work by Chhetri et al. discusses modifications to toolpath generation to increase or decrease the side-channel information that could be used in reconstruction. Al-Faruque et al. acquired a 2019 patent [5] on defending side-channel attacks with their mutual information reduction strategy. Gatlin et al. [18] utilized the power side-channel for detecting sabotage attacks but did not attempt reconstruction, instead using a Principal Component Analysis–based signature.

## 3. Challenges of Reconstruction
In this work, we focus on 3D printers employing the FDM process, widely used in both desktop and high-end polymer 3D printers. The process is based on the extrusion of heated polymer filament through a nozzle, built into a print head that can move along the X-, Y-, and Z-axes, and extrude or retract filament along the E-axis. Both printhead movement and filament extrusion are driven by motors, controlled by an on-board motor controller. The bipolar hybrid stepper motor is a commonly used positional actuator in FDM printers; our test printer, the Lulzbot Taz 6, uses these motors exclusively. Each motor has two phases, and each phase is connected by two wires, forming an electrical loop delivering current from the controller. The current is delivered in a sinusoidal pattern, making it Alternating Current (AC).
