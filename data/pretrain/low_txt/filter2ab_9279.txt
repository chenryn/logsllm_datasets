**ATT&CK ID:** T0800  
**Technique Name:** Activate Firmware Update Mode

Adversaries may exploit the firmware update mode on devices to disrupt their normal operation, thereby preventing expected response functions from engaging during an emergency or process malfunction. For instance, protection relays and similar devices often have a dedicated mode for firmware installation. In this mode, process monitoring and related functions are typically suspended to facilitate the loading of new firmware. If a device is left in this update mode without receiving new firmware, it may enter an inactive holding state. By intentionally placing and maintaining a device in this mode, adversaries can effectively deny its usual functionalities.
