### History Section
- **Network Location Omission**: You may omit the network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to grants permission.

### Acknowledgements and Dedications
- **Title Preservation**: For any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications," preserve the title of the section. Additionally, maintain the substance and tone of each contributor's acknowledgments and/or dedications within the section.

### Invariant Sections
- **Unaltered Preservation**: Preserve all Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in both text and titles. Section numbers or their equivalents are not considered part of the section titles.

### Endorsements
- **Deletion Requirement**: Delete any section entitled "Endorsements." Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
- **Retitling Prohibition**: Do not retitle any existing section to be entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

### Warranty Disclaimers
- **Preservation**: Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

### New Front-Matter Sections or Appendices
- **Invariant Designation**: If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may, at your option, designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

### Adding Endorsements
- **New Endorsements Section**: You may add a section entitled "Endorsements," provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—such as statements of peer review or approval by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

### Cover Texts
- **Front-Cover and Back-Cover Texts**: You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; however, you may replace the old one with explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

### Author and Publisher Names
- **Publicity and Endorsement**: The authors and publishers of the Document do not, by this License, give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

### Combining Documents
- **Combination Requirements**: You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice. Additionally, preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
- **Single License Copy**: The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding, at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
- **Section Combination**: In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise, combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements," and any sections entitled "Dedications." You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

### Collections of Documents
- **Collection Rules**: You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
- **Extraction and Distribution**: You may extract a single document from such a collection and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

### Aggregation with Independent Works
- **Aggregate Definition**: A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
- **License Applicability**: When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
- **Cover Text Placement**: If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise, they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

### Translation
- **Modification Type**: Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
- **Invariant Sections Translation**: Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
- **Translation Inclusion**: You may include a translation of this License and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
- **Title Change**: If a section in the Document is entitled "Acknowledgements," "Dedications," or "History," the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

### Termination
- **License Violation**: You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
- **Reinstatement**: However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
- **First Violation**: Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
- **Termination Impact**: Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

### Future Revisions of This License
- **New Versions**: The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
- **Version Numbering**: Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

### Relicensing
- **Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site (MMC Site)**: This means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
- **Massive Multiauthor Collaboration (MMC)**: This means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
- **CC-BY-SA**: This means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.
- **Incorporate**: This means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.
- **Eligibility for Relicensing**: An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
- **Relicensing Permission**: The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

### Addendum: How to Use This License for Your Documents
- **Including the License**: To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:
  - **No Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts, and Back-Cover Texts**:
    ```
    Copyright (C) [year] [your name].
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
    Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ‘‘GNU
    Free Documentation License’’.
    ```
  - **With Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts, and Back-Cover Texts**:
    ```
    with the Invariant Sections being [list their titles], with
    the Front-Cover Texts being [list], and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being [list].
    ```
  - **Other Combinations**: If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.
- **Code Examples**: If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.
