### Classical Simple Epidemic Model: J(t)

- **Infected Hosts**: \( J(t) = I(t) + R(t) \)
- **Infectious Hosts**: \( I(t) \)
- **Removed Hosts from Susceptible**: \( Q(t) \)

### Time (t) in Hours
- 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80

### Figure 7: Numerical Solution of Two-Factor Worm Model

By comparing the two-factor model solution \( J(t) \) in Figure 7 with the number of infected hosts in our Code Red worm simulation (Figure 5), we observe a consistent and well-matched trend.

**Key Observations:**
- The number of infectious hosts \( I(t) \) reaches its maximum value at \( t = 29 \).
- After \( t = 29 \), \( I(t) \) decreases because the number of removed infectious hosts per unit time exceeds the number of newly generated infectious hosts.

**Explanation:**
- From the two-factor model equation (17):
  \[
  \frac{dI(t)}{dt} = \beta(t)S(t)I(t) - \frac{dR(t)}{dt}
  \]
  \[
  \frac{dI(t)}{dt} = [\beta(t)S(t) - \gamma]I(t)
  \]
- The number of susceptible hosts \( S(t) \) is a monotonically decreasing function of time.
- The maximum number of infectious hosts, \( \max I(t) \), is reached at time \( t_c \) when \( S(t_c) = \frac{\gamma}{\beta(t_c)} \).
- For \( t > t_c \), \( \beta(t)S(t) - \gamma < 0 \), thus \( I(t) \) decreases.

### Figure 8: Observed Code Red Scan Unique Sources Hour-by-Hour

- **Code Red Scans per Hour**:
  - 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2
  - UTC hours (July 19 - 20): 04:00, 09:00, 14:00, 19:00, 00:00, 04:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00, 18:00, 20:00, 22:00, 00:00

### Figure 9: Comparison Between Observed Data and Our Model

- **Observed Data**:
  - Collected by Smith [16] and Eichman [13], showing the number of Code Red infectious sources sending scans each hour on July 19th.
  - Plotted as average values in Figure 8.
- **Model Data**:
  - Derived from our model as shown in Figure 7.
  - Plotted for the period from July 19th 12:00 to 00:00 UTC (Code Red propagation stopped after 00:00 UTC July 20th).

**Comparison:**
- The observed data and the model data are well matched, as shown in Figure 9.

### Limitations of the Classical Simple Epidemic Model

- The classical simple epidemic model (1) cannot explain the drop in Code Red propagation during the last several hours of July 19th.
- According to the simple epidemic model (Figure 4) and observed data (Figure 1), previous studies concluded that Code Red reached saturation around 19:00 UTC July 19th, with almost all susceptible IIS servers online being infected.
- However, our model shows that only about 60% of all susceptible IIS servers were infected around that time.

### Conclusion

- We present a more accurate Internet worm model and use it to model Code Red worm propagation.
- Internet worms can be modeled using epidemic models, but these models are not always accurate due to specific properties of Internet worms.
- Two major factors affecting Internet worm propagation are:
  - Human countermeasures (cleaning, patching, filtering, disconnecting computers and networks).
  - Slowing down of infection rate due to the impact on Internet traffic and infrastructure.
- Our two-factor worm model matches well with the observed Code Red worm data of July 19th, 2001.
- The increasing speed of the number of infected hosts slows down when about 50% of susceptible hosts are infected, explaining the earlier slowing down of Code Red infection.
- The two-factor worm model is a general model for Internet worms without topology constraints.
- Human countermeasures play a crucial role in slowing down and eliminating virus and worm propagation.
- Internet worm models have limitations, such as not predicting arbitrary stopping or restarting events.
