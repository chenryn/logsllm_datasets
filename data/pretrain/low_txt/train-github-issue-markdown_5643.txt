### Description
The Apache Airflow project provides a robust Operator for Cloud Functions, as documented here:
https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-google/stable/operators/cloud/functions.html

However, if you require more computational power or control than what the Cloud Functions runtime can provide, using Cloud Run may be a more suitable option.

### Use Case/Motivation
The goal is to enable the triggering of Cloud Run jobs from Airflow, similar to how Cloud Functions are currently triggered. This would be particularly useful when dealing with tasks that require slightly more computational resources and are not well-suited for Cloud Functions.
