### 3.4 Performance Degradation: Root Causes

We now use our measurements to identify the reasons for persistent performance degradation observed over consecutive days, focusing on cases where both ping round-trip time (RTT) and HTTP throughput are affected.

#### Inefficient Paths

One reason for performance degradation is inefficient network paths. Zariﬁs et al. [14] provide a detailed taxonomy and analysis of path inflation in mobile networks. Here, we focus on the time evolution of these issues and limit our analysis to cases where both latency and throughput were impacted.

For example, we observed an increase in ping RTT in T-Mobile’s Bay Area HSDPA network from November 12, 2011, to December 10, 2011. Using DNS lookups, we found that clients previously directed to Mountain View were being sent to Seattle, resulting in additional delay due to path inflation (Fig. 5a). After December 10, clients were again directed toward Mountain View.

Another high-latency event was observed in T-Mobile’s Seattle HSDPA network (Fig. 5b). Prior to the event, traceroutes indicated that traffic from T-Mobile ingressed into Level 3 in Seattle and then entered Google’s network. After February 15, traffic from these subscribers ingressed into Level 3 at a peering point in Los Angeles before entering Google’s network. On February 20, routing returned to its previous state (ingress and egress point in the Seattle area), and the median RTT decreased to its previous value, strongly implying that the change in performance was due to the topology change.

In Fig. 5c, we observe that ping RTT and the number of traceroute hops increased for Verizon LTE users in the Bay Area. Previously, clients were directed to a Google frontend in the Bay Area; after the change, clients were sent to the same Google ingress point but then had their traffic routed to a frontend in Seattle, leading to approximately 30% higher latency.

### Signal Strength

It is well known that weak signal strength reduces channel efficiency for wireless communication. Therefore, it is important to account for this when interpreting measurements. Using Mobiperf clients, we gathered network measurements annotated with the signal strength, in Arbitrary Strength Units (ASUs), reported during the probes to determine the impact of signal strength on performance.

Figure 6 shows how three performance metrics—ping RTT, packet loss, and HTTP throughput—vary with ASU values for AT&T HSDPA users in Seattle. The figures indicate high packet loss, latency, and low throughput for ASU values between 0 and 8 (confirming the results in [15]). At larger ASU values, the increase in signal strength has less impact on performance. These results highlight the critical importance of accounting for signal strength when interpreting measurement results. For example, when measuring a carrier’s capacity, it is essential to conduct such tests in regions with high signal strength.

### 4 Related Work

Many previous studies have attempted to improve our visibility into and understanding of mobile network performance. We can broadly characterize them according to the type of network performance they measured, where they conducted measurements, and how they performed measurements. In this work, we are the first to use controlled, active measurement experiments to continuously monitor end-to-end network performance seen from mobile devices across more than 100 carriers over a period of 17 months.

#### Passive Measurements, Infrastructure, Single Carrier

Several studies focus on passive measurements from inside mobile carriers [7–9]. While important for debugging the infrastructure components of latency, the view from such locations does not necessarily indicate the performance on mobile devices.

#### Active Measurements, End Devices, Single Carrier

Several projects use active measurements from end devices but focus on a single carrier for a limited duration, often conducting fine-grained and low-level analyses of performance. For example, [5] measured goodput, delay, and jitter of HSDPA and WCDMA networks from an operator in Finland using active measurements from a laptop. [6] compared LTE and HSPA networks by conducting high-precision latency measurements for an operator in Austria. [16, 4, 17, 18] studied TCP performance in CDMA2000 networks. [16] investigated steady-state TCP performance over CDMA 1x EV-DO downlink/uplink with active measurements of long-lived TCP connections at the endpoints for a Korean operator. [18, 4] conducted cross-layer measurements of transport, physical, and MAC layer parameters, characterizing the wireless scheduler in a commercial CDMA2000 network and its impact on TCP performance.

#### Active Measurements, End Devices, Several Carriers

Similar to the previous examples, several studies also include comparisons across multiple carriers. [19] investigated the performance of three Norwegian operators and conducted active measurements from end-to-end devices to study the impact of packet size on minimal one-way delay for the uplink in 3G mobile networks. [11] performed active measurements for more than six months from 90 voting locations and measured the round-trip delay of three network operators in Norway, finding operator-specific network design and configurations as the most important factor for delays. [2] compared the 3G performance of three carriers in Hong Kong under saturated conditions by conducting measurements at 170 sites over four months.

#### Active Measurements, End Devices, Pervasive

Most closely related to our work are [1] and [3], which gather active measurements from apps running on mobile devices but rely on user-generated tests. In contrast, our work uses controlled experiments to schedule measurements independently of user activity, enabling a more continuous view of performance in mobile networks.

### 5 Conclusion

This paper provides an initial look at end-to-end performance as seen from mobile devices, using a dataset of scheduled network measurements spanning more than 100 carriers over 17 months. We find significant performance differences across carriers, access technologies, geographic regions, and over time. However, we emphasize that these variations are not uniform, making network performance difficult to diagnose. Using supplemental measurements such as DNS lookups and traceroutes, we identified the reasons behind persistent performance problems. Further, we examined the stability of network performance, which can help inform efficient scheduling of future network measurements. Overall, we find that performance in cellular networks is not improving on average, suggesting the need for more monitoring and diagnosis. As part of our future work, we are investigating how to automatically detect persistent performance problems in real-time, gather additional network measurements to explain them, and provide this information to carriers and end-users automatically.
