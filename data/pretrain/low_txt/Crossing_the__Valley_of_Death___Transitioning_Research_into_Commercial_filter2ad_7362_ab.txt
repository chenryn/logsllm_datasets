### The Use of "Source" as a Technology Transition Method

Dr. Carl Landwehr has highlighted the importance of evaluating the outcomes of U.S. Government investments in technology transition. Studying these results can provide valuable insights as we continue to refine the bridge between research and commercialization.

### The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Years

#### A. Getting Started

In June 2003, Jane Alexander, the former Deputy Director of DARPA, contacted me to inquire about my interest in joining the newly established Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate. She offered me the opportunity to build the Cybersecurity R&D program from the ground up. As my tenure at DARPA was concluding, this presented an ideal opportunity. I began my role at DHS S&T in October 2003.

The mission of DHS S&T is to "conduct, stimulate, and enable research, development, testing, evaluation, and timely transition of homeland security capabilities to federal, state, and local operational end-users." This mission aligned well with my goals, which were different from my experiences at DARPA.

Given the strong focus on both internal DHS infrastructure and external critical providers, we designed an R&D execution model that encompassed the full spectrum of necessary activities: research, development, testing, evaluation, and transition (RDTE&T). This model, known affectionately as the "Circle of Life," ensured that completed research products could be tested by operational end-users and potentially result in commercial products.

**Key Components of the Model:**
- **Customers:** Most R&D funded by DHS S&T is in response to specific customer needs, whether internal to DHS or external.
- **Pre-R&D Activities:** Workshops, roadmaps, and solicitations ensure that funded R&D is focused on identified customer needs.
- **R&D and Supporting Programs:** This phase involves the actual work and the development of supporting infrastructure.
- **Post-R&D Activities:** DHS S&T provides experimental deployment and outreach activities to assist researchers in transitioning their technologies.

#### B. Changing Standard Solicitations

One of my initial priorities was to reform the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process at DHS S&T. It was crucial to incorporate technology transition from the outset. This change required the R&D community to adapt, and it also fostered partnerships that might not have otherwise been established. For instance, it compelled academic researchers to collaborate with commercial companies, a practice they were not accustomed to.

**Revised BAA Text:**
- **Type I (New Technologies):** Proposals for new technologies must include an applied research phase, a development phase, and a deployment phase, with an emphasis on research and development. Proposals may request funding for up to 36 months, including the deployment phase.
- **Type II (Prototype Technologies):** Proposals for more mature prototype technologies must include a development phase and a deployment phase. Proposals may request funding for up to 24 months, including the deployment phase.
- **Type III (Mature Technologies):** Proposals for mature technologies must include a deployment phase only. Proposals may request funding for up to 12 months.

The objective of this structure is to support immediate technology transition where possible and to create transition paths for new capabilities from the outset. Offerors must also include a description of their plans for commercializing the technology or other transition plans, such as partnerships or open-source contributions.

This BAA text represented a significant departure from previous practices in the cybersecurity R&D community. Over the past six years, DHS S&T has published two BAAs and funded over 30 projects. Many of the successful teams included joint academic and industry partners, with the industry partner responsible for the technology transition aspect.

#### C. DHS S&T Successes

After six years at DHS S&T, I reviewed the progress and results of the program. I had been responsible for funding and managing over $180 million in research. There were many successes and relatively few failures, which I attribute to the RDTE&T model. We are making better progress in helping government-funded performers cross the "valley of death."

**Notable Technology Transitions:**
- **IronKey, Inc.:** Funded to develop a secure USB device, IronKey's product provides secure web browsing, cryptographic authentication, and endpoint security. It won the Government Computer News’ Best of FOSE Award for FY 2007 and is now available commercially. IronKey received over $20M in venture funding and has grown from two founders to over 100 employees since 2005.
- **Secure64:** Developed the DNSSEC Signer, a turnkey solution for DNSSEC deployment. It won the Government Computer News’ Best of FOSE Award for FY 2009 and has sold products to various U.S. government departments.
- **Vulnerability Discovery and Remediation Tool:** Developed by a team from Stanford University, Coverity, and Symantec, this tool scans open-source code to identify and fix security vulnerabilities. It has over 900 customers across government and private industry.
- **VIAssist:** A visualization toolkit for netflow analytics developed by Secure Decisions, Inc., VIAssist is being piloted within US-CERT for network flow data analysis.
- **Password Hash (PwdHash):** An anti-phishing browser plug-in developed by a Stanford University team, PwdHash is available as open source and has been recognized in the Computerworld Horizon Awards competition.

#### D. Concluding Remarks

To achieve the necessary deployment of new innovations, technology transition must be a key consideration for all R&D investments. This requires the federal government to move beyond models where most R&D programs support limited operational evaluations. Future R&D activities should focus on technology transition, and program managers and principal investigators should be rewarded for their transition efforts.

If we are to truly transform the "innovation landscape," R&D processes must ensure that program funds are allocated for technology transition and that sufficient resources are reserved for the less "researchy" but equally important processes needed to bridge the "Transition Chasm."

### Acknowledgments and Disclaimers

I thank Peter Neumann for encouraging me to write this paper and Peter, Marv Schaefer, David Evans, Matt Bishop, and Kevin Thompson for their review comments. There are likely many other transitions that I am unaware of, and I apologize to those who have crossed the "valley of death" independently. I encourage you to document your experiences so others can learn from them.
