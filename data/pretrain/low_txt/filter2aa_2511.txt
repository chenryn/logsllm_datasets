## Physical Access Control Systems

### What Do They Do?
- **Purpose**: Limit access to physical locations and resources.
- **Components**:
  - Doors
  - Gates
  - Elevator floors
  - Barrier arms
  - Keypad entry (entry/directory codes)
  - Telephone entry
  - Radio receivers for remotes
  - Proximity cards (RFID)
  - Swipe cards
  - Sensors

### How Do They Work?
- **Use Cases**:
  - Gated communities
  - Parking garages
  - Office buildings
  - Apartments
  - Hotels/motels
  - Commercial buildings
  - Recreational facilities
  - Medical facilities

### Common Vendors
- Doorking
- Chamberlain
- Sentex
- Li4Master
- Nortek
- Linear Controllers

## Linear Commercial Access Control Systems

### Linear Controllers
- **AE1000Plus**
- **AE2000Plus**
- **AM3Plus**

#### Features
- **Commercial Telephone Entry System**:
  - Utilizes a telephone line
  - Supports thousands of users
  - Networked with other controllers
  - Configurable and controllable through a PC
  - Serial connection

#### AM-SEK Kit (Serial-to-TCP)
- **Function**: Converts serial to Ethernet
- **Benefits**:
  - Management over TCP/IP network
  - Remote management (over the internet)

### Typical Installation
- **Setup**:
  - Management PC: 192.168.0.40
  - AE1000Plus Controller
  - Router/Switch: 192.168.0.0/24
  - Software: AccessBase2000

#### AccessBase2000 Capabilities
- Add/remove users
- Entry and directory codes
- Cards and transmitters
- Manually toggle relays
- View log reports
- Communication through serial
- Requires a password for authentication

### PC to Controller Communication
- **Request Example**:
  - `5AA5000A1105010008000000CB97`
- **Response Examples**:
  - Acknowledged: `5AA50004110C4625`
  - Not Acknowledged: `5AA50005110D024C23`
  - Invalid Checksum: `5AA50005110D017EB8`
  - No response (not authenticated): `5AA5000A11013635343332319A71`

- **Command Set**:
  - Password: `01`
  - Poll Status: `02`
  - Poll Log: `03`
  - Command: `04`
  - Time: `05`
  - Put Flash: `06`

## Attacks

### Local and Remote Attacks
- **Physical Access**:
  - Local programming
  - Serial port inside the controller

### Local Attacks
- **AE-500 – Default Password**:
  - Hold 0 and 2 on the keypad
  - Type the default password: `123456#`
  - Input commands to add a new entry code: `31#9999#9999#99#`
  - New code: `9999`
  - Access granted!

- **Master Key**:
  - Same key for all AE1000plus, AM3plus controllers
  - Purchase from suppliers or eBay
  - Or pick the lock
  - Full access to the device

- **Manual Relay Latch Buttons**:
  - Toggle relay
  - Lock their state
  - Programming buttons
  - Program device locally
  - Erase memory
  - Active phone line
  - Serial connection to the controller

- **Tamper Monitoring**:
  - Magnetic tamper switch inside enclosure
  - No active alerts
  - Can be bypassed by placing a magnet on the outside

### Remote Attacks
- **Internal Network Access**:
  - IP of Serial to TCP device
  - TCP Port 4660

- **External Network Access**:
  - IP of Serial to TCP device
  - TCP Port 4660 open to the internet

- **Brute-force Attack**:
  - No rate limiting
  - No password lockout
  - Small key space (6 numeric characters)
  - Scriptable

- **No Password Necessary**:
  - Authentication not enforced
  - Send unauthenticated commands
  - Commands will execute without confirmation data

- **Open Doors Remotely**:
  - Send one simple command: `5AA5000A1105010000080000E88D`
  - Triggers a relay for 2 seconds, opening a door or gate

- **Lock Doors Open/Closed**:
  - Keeps doors/gates open or closed
  - Will not respond to user input (RFID cards, remotes, etc.)
  - Persist until manually unlocked or rebooted

- **Delete Logs From The Controller**:
  - Downloading logs deletes them from the controller
  - Hide evidence of entry or tampering

- **Change the Password**:
  - Upload configuration settings
  - Change password without needing the previous password
  - Normal functionality remains
  - Upload other configuration changes

- **Denial of Service**:
  - Fake database update will disable the controller
  - Overwrite device firmware
  - Lock relays to prevent access

## Demo

### ACAT – Access Control Attack Tool
- **Locating Controllers**:
  - Scan the network
  - Look for any COM port redirectors
  - Default port: TCP 4660
  - Send broadcast packet to UDP 55954
  - Devices will respond
  - Send a password request string to port 4660: `5AA5000A11013635343332319A71`

- **UDP Broadcast**:
  - Broadcast: `5AA5000A11013635343332319A71`
  - Response: `5AA50004110C4625` or `5AA50005110D024C23`

## Recommendations
- Always change the default password
- Change physical locks
- Use a direct serial connection
- If networked, utilize authentication
- Avoid exposing the controller to the internet

## Final Thoughts
- **Other Vendors**: Ongoing research
- **Tool**: More work is needed
  - Prototype available on [GitHub](https://github.com/linuz/Access-Control-Attack-Tool)
  - Working on an Nmap script
