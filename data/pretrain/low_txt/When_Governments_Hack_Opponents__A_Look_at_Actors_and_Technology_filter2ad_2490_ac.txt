### Detection by Common AV Products

Targets typically receive one of the following: (1) a PE file within a .zip or .rar archive, (2) a file download link, or (3) a link that triggers a drive-by download. The messages often include text, frequently in Arabic, designed to persuade the target to execute the file or click the link.

### Early Attacks and Bait Files

The first attacks, as shown in Figure 3, date back to 2012 and used bait files with a DarkComet RAT payload. These attacks shared the same Command and Control (C&C) server, 216.6.0.28, a Syrian IP address belonging to the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment, which has been publicly reported as a C&C for Syrian malware since February 2012 [45]. The first bait file appeared to the victim as a PDF containing information about a planned uprising in Aleppo. In reality, the file was a Windows Screensaver (.scr) masquerading as a PDF using Unicode Right-to-Left Override (RLO), making a name like “.fdp.scr” display as “.rcs.pdf.” The second bait file was a dummy program containing DarkComet, disguised as a Skype call encryption program, playing on opposition fears of government backdoors in common software. The third attack, observed in October 2013, lured targets with emails purporting to contain or link to videos about the ongoing conflict, infecting victims with Xtreme RAT and using the C&C server tn1.linkpc.net.

### Seeding Methods

Attackers typically use compromised accounts, including those of arrested individuals, or fake identities posing as pro-opposition. Our illustration shows, in abstract terms, the use of Victim A’s account to seed malware (e.g., "Aleppo Plan") via Skype messages to Victim(s) Bn.

In the cases of Opposition Member C and NGO Worker D (actual victims, not abstract), the targeting was done through emails from domains apparently belonging to opposition groups, indicating a potential compromise. One domain remains active, hosting a website for the Salafist Al-Nusra front [46], while the other appears dormant. Opposition Member C received a malicious file as an email attachment, while NGO Worker D was sent a shortened link (url[.]no/Uu5) to a download from a directory on Mrconstrucciones[.]net, a site that may have been compromised. Both attacks resulted in an Xtreme RAT infection.

### Extended Deception

In the case of the fake Skype encryption, the deception extended to a YouTube video from "IT Security Lab" [47] demonstrating the program's purported capabilities, as well as a website promoting the tool, skype-encryption.sytes.net. The attackers also constructed a basic, faux GUI for their "Encryption" program (see Figure 4). The fake GUI includes non-functional buttons like "Encrypt" and "DeCrypt," which generate fake prompts. While the victim is distracted by these interactions, their machine is infected with DarkComet 3.3 [32, 33].

### Campaign Volume and Events

Anecdotally, campaign volume appears to correlate with significant events in the ongoing conflict. For example, campaigns dwindled and then rebounded within hours after Syria’s 2012 Internet shutdown [48]. Similarly, activity observed by the authors declined prior to expectations of US-led military action against Syrian government targets in September 2013. Once this option seemed off the table, the volume of new samples and campaigns increased, including recent targeting of NGO workers, as shown in Figure 3. We are aware of only a negligible number of cases where the opposition used similar RATs against Syrian government supporters, although evidence exists of other kinds of electronic attacks by third parties.

### Real-World Consequences

The logistics and activities of Syria’s numerous opposition groups are intentionally concealed to protect both their efficacy and the lives of participants. However, Syrian opposition members are generally familiar with stories of digital compromises of high-profile figures, including those in sensitive roles, as well as rank-and-file members. Compromise of operational security poses a documented threat to life, both for victims of electronic compromise and their family members and associates. The Syrian conflict is ongoing, making it difficult to assemble comprehensive evidence of linkages between government actors and malware campaigns. Many individuals whose identities have been compromised are in prison or otherwise disappeared, unable to relate the evidence presented to them during interrogation. Still, strong circumstantial evidence links the use of RATs, phishing, and government activity, summarized briefly here:

1. Many Syrians have recounted to journalists and the authors how interrogators confronted them with material from their computers. For example, "The policeman told me, 'Do you remember when you were talking to your friend and you told him you had something wrong and paid a lot of money? At that time, we were taking information from your laptop.'" [41]

2. Syrian activists have supplied cases to international journalists [41] where arrests are quickly followed by the social media accounts of detained individuals seeding malware to contact lists (Figure 3).

3. Despite the notoriety of the attack campaigns, including mentions of C&C IPs in international media [45], the Syrian government has made no public statements about these campaigns nor acted to shut down the servers.

Beyond the ongoing challenges of attribution, these malware campaigns have a tangible impact on the Syrian opposition and generally align with the interests of the Syrian government’s propaganda operations. The case of Abdul Razzaq Tlass, a leader in the Free Syrian Army, is illustrative. In 2012, a string of videos emerged showing Tlass sexting and engaged in lewd activity in front of a webcam [49]. While he denied the videos, the harm to his reputation was substantial, and he was eventually replaced [50].

### UAE Surveillance

While the UAE has experienced no recent uprisings or political unrest, it has cracked down on its opposition, concurrent with the Arab Spring. The first attacks we observed in the UAE involved a government-grade "lawful interception" trojan known as Remote Control System (RCS), sold by the Italian company HackingTeam. The associated C&C server indicated direct UAE government involvement. Over time, we stopped receiving RCS samples from UAE targets and instead observed a shift to the use of off-the-shelf RATs and possible involvement of cyber-mercenary groups. However, poor attacker operational security allowed us to link most observed attacks together.

#### RCS and Exploitation

UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, imprisoned from April to November 2011 after signing an online pro-democracy petition [51], received an email purportedly from "Arabic Wikileaks" in July 2012. He opened the attached "veryimportant.doc" and saw what he described as "scrambled letters." He forwarded the email to us for investigation. The attachment exploited CVE-2010-3333, an RTF parsing vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The document did not contain any bait content, and part of the malformed RTF that triggered the exploit was displayed in the document. The exploit loaded shellcode that downloaded a second stage from ar-24.com, which in turn downloaded spyware from ar-24.com. This combination is denoted as the 3-Stage Exploit Kit in Figure 5. When we obtained the sample in July 2012, ar-24.com resolved to an IP address on Linode, a hosting provider. Three months later, it resolved to a UAE address belonging to the Royal Group [52], an organization linked to the UAE government, chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al-Nayhan, a member of the UAE ruling family and a son of the founder of the UAE.

#### Identification and Analysis

We identified strings in memory that matched those in a Symantec analysis [53] of RCS (also known as DaVinci or Crisis), a product of the Italian company HackingTeam [54]. We also located a structurally similar Word document via VirusTotal. The document used the same exploit and attempted to download a second stage from rcs-demo.hackingteam.it, which was unavailable at the time of testing. RCS has a suite of functionality largely similar to FinSpy. One difference is in the vectors used to install the spyware. We located additional samples, some embedded in a .jar file that installs an OS-appropriate version of RCS (Windows or macOS), optionally using an exploit. If embedded as an applet and no exploit is present, Java displays a security warning and asks the user whether they authorize the installation. We also saw instances of the 3-Stage Exploit Kit where the first stage contained a Flash exploit; in some cases, we could obtain all stages and confirm that they installed RCS. Some samples were packed with the MPress packer [55], and some Windows samples were obfuscated to look like the PuTTY SSH client.

Another difference is in persistence. For example, the RCS sample sent to Ahmed added a Run registry key, whereas the FinSpy samples used in Bahrain overwrote the hard disk’s boot sector to modify the boot process, loading the spyware before the OS and injecting it into OS processes as they start. The RCS samples we examined also had the ability to propagate to other devices, including inactive VMware virtual machines by modifying the disk image, onto USB flash drives, and onto Windows Mobile phones. We did not observe similar capabilities in the FinSpy samples we examined.

#### Exploitation of Captured Data

When Ahmed Mansoor received the RCS document, he opened it, infecting his computer (Figure 5). Ahmed subsequently noted several suspicious accesses to his GMail account using IMAP. Even after he changed his password, the accesses continued. While corresponding with Ahmed on his compromised account, an author of this paper discovered that the attackers had installed an application-specific password [56] in Ahmed’s GMail account, a secondary password that they apparently used to access his account even after he changed his main password. The suspicious accesses stopped after the removal of the application-specific password.

Two weeks after this correspondence with Ahmed, one of us (Author in Figure 5) received a targeted email with a link to a file hosted on Google Docs containing a commercial off-the-shelf RAT, Xtreme RAT. The email was sent from the UAE’s timezone (as well as that of other countries) and contained the terms "very important" and "wikileaks," just like in the email received by Ahmed. The instance of Xtreme RAT sent to the Author used owner.no-ip.biz for its C&C, one of the domains mentioned in a report published by Norman about a year-long campaign of cyberattacks on Israeli and Palestinian targets carried out by a group that Norman was unable to identify [57]. Three months after the Author was targeted, Ahmed received an email containing an attachment with Xtreme RAT that talked to the same C&C server (Figure 5), suggesting that the attackers who infected Ahmed with RCS may have provided a list of interesting email addresses to another group for further targeting.

#### Possible Consequences

Shortly after he was targeted, Ahmed says he was physically assaulted twice by an attacker who appeared able to track Ahmed’s location [58]. He also reports that his car was stolen, a large sum of money disappeared from his bank account, and his passport was confiscated [59]. He believes these consequences are part of a government intimidation campaign against him, but we did not uncover any direct links to his infection. (Interestingly, spyware subsequently sent to others has used bait content about Ahmed.)

#### Further Attacks

In October 2012, UAE Journalist A and Human Rights activist B (per Figure 6) forwarded us suspicious emails they had received containing a Word document corresponding to the first stage of the 3-Stage Exploit Kit (Figure 5). The attachment contained an embedded Flash file that exploited a vulnerability fixed in Adobe Flash 11.4, loading shellcode to download a second stage from faddeha.com. We were unable to obtain the second stage or the ultimate payload, as the website was unavailable at the time of testing. However, the exploit kit appears indicative of HackingTeam involvement. A page on faddeha.com found in Google’s cache contained an embedded .jar with the same applet class (WebEnhancer) as those observed in other .jar files that we found to contain RCS.

#### Off-the-Shelf RATs

We found a file that VirusTotal had downloaded from faddeha.com, which appeared to be a remote access toolkit known as SpyNet, available for general purchase for 50 Euros [60]. The SpyNet sample communicated with the C&C hamas.sytes.net. We found another instance of the first stage of the 3-Stage Exploit Kit on VirusTotal. The exploit downloaded a second stage, which in turn downloaded a sample of SpyNet from maile-s.com. This sample of SpyNet communicated with the same C&C hamas.sytes.net. The sample was packed using ASProtect [61]. When run, the sample unpacks a compiled Visual Basic project that loads, via the RunPE method [62], an executable packed with UPX [63]. Finally, this executable unpacks SpyNet. SpyNet’s GUI only offers an option to pack with UPX, suggesting that the attackers specially added the other layers of packing. In some cases, the Visual Basic project bears the name NoWayTech, which appears to be an underground RunPE tool, while others are named SpyVisual, which we have been unable to trace to any public underground tools and thus may reflect customization by the attacker. The SpyVisual projects contain the string c:\Users\Zain\AppData\Local\Temp\OLE1EmbedStrm.wav, which we used as the fingerprint VBPacker in Figure 6.

#### CedarKey Attack

The same VBPacker was used in an attack on Relative of political detainee D and H.R. activist E (per Figure 6). These individuals received emails containing a link to a webpage hosted on cedarkeyrv.com impersonating YouTube. Loading the page greeted the target with "Video loading please wait..." The page redirected to a YouTube video a few seconds later but first loaded a Java exploit [64]—a known vulnerability with no patch at the time the emails were sent. Oracle released a patch 12 hours after activists began receiving these links.

The cedarkeyrv.com domain is associated with an RV park in Cedar Key, Florida. The website’s hosting company told us that the site had apparently suffered a compromise but did not have further details. The exploit used in the attack appears to have been originally posted by a Kuwaiti user, njq8, on an Arabic-language exploit sharing site [65]. We contacted njq8, who told us that he had obtained the exploit elsewhere and modified it prior to posting.

The attack downloaded an instance of SpyNet from isteeler.com (which from our inspection did not appear to have any legitimate content), which used the C&C storge.myftp.org. This same C&C occurred in another attack (Figure 6) targeting Relative of political detainee D; in that case, the payload was a freely-available RAT known as njRAT, written by the same njq8 as the exploit-poster discussed above. However, we did not find any other evidence suggesting njq8’s involvement in either attack.

#### More SpyNet Attacks

The domain hamas.sytes.net, which we previously saw used by two SpyNet samples, historically resolved to 67.205.79.177. An unidentified dropper using this C&C targeted Journalist F; a SpyNet attack on Relative of political detainee D also used this C&C. In that latter case, the sample arrived via email in a .rar attachment that contained an .scr file disguised as a Word document. The .scr file was a self-extracting archive that decompressed and ran both the bait document and the payload. The SMTP source of the email was webmail.upload.bz.

#### Appin

In early 2013, UAE H.R. activist E forwarded numerous documents that included a particular CVE-2012-0158 exploit for Microsoft Word. In all, these totaled 17 distinct hashes of documents and 10 distinct hashes of payloads (some documents that differed in their hash downloaded the same payload). The exploits primarily downloaded instances of SpyNet from upload.bz, which for the most part communicated with C&C at sn.all-google.com. This domain was also used for C&C in other attacks, including that on Journalist C. The other CVE-2012-0158 exploits downloaded DarkComet and www.technopenta.com after posting system information to random123.site11.com. All three domains match those used by an Indian cybermercenary group said to be linked to Appin Security Group [66]. The former two domains hosted content other than spyware (i.e., they may have been compromised). We alerted the owner of www.getmedia.us, who removed the payloads.

#### Empirical Characterization

The samples we received afforded us an opportunity to empirically characterize the use of FinFisher and Hacking Team around the world, enabling us to assess their prevalence and identify other country cases that may warrant future investigation. We analyzed the samples and the behavior of their C&C servers to develop indicators (fingerprints) for how the servers respond to certain types of requests. We then scanned the full Internet IPv4 address space ("/0") for these, along with probing results found by past scans. In many cases, we do not release the full details of our fingerprints to avoid compromising what may be legitimate investigations.

##### Identifying and Linking Servers

We developed a number of fingerprints for identifying FinSpy servers using HTTP-based probing as well as FinSpy’s custom TLV-based protocol. We leveraged quirks such as specific non-compliance with RFC 2616, responses to certain types of invalid data, and the presence of signatures such as the bizarre "Hallo Steffi" that Guarnieri identified from Bahraini FinSpy C&C servers [67, 68]. See Appendix A for details. We then exhaustively scanned the Internet looking for matches to these fingerprints.

Gamma documentation advertises that an operator of FinSpy can obscure the location of the C&C server (called the master) by setting up a proxy known as a relay. In Spring 2013, we noticed FinSpy servers now issuing 302 Redirects to google.com. However, we noticed anomalies: for example, servers in India were redirecting to the Latvian version of Google, google.lv. We suspect that the server in India was a relay forwarding to a master in Latvia. Because the master served as a proxy for Google, we could uncover its IP address using a Google feature that prints a user’s IP address for the query "IP address." We created an additional fingerprint based on the proxying behavior and issued GET /search?q=ip+address&nord=1 requests to servers. We note some interesting master locations in Table 4.

##### Server Locations

In all, our fingerprints matched 92 distinct IP addresses in 35 different countries. Probing these on 8/8/13 revealed 22 distinct addresses still responding, sited in: Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia, Ethiopia, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macedonia, Mexico, Romania, Serbia, Turkmenistan, and the United States. We found servers responding to a number of our fingerprints, suggesting either that some servers lag in their updates or a concerted effort to vary the behavior of FinSpy servers to make detection harder.

We found: (1) 3 IP addresses in ranges registered to Gamma. (2) Servers in 3 IP ranges explicitly registered to government agencies: Turkmenistan’s Ministry of Communications, Qatar’s State Security Bureau, and the Bulgarian Council of Ministers. (3) 3 additional IP addresses in Bahrain, all in Batelco. (4) Servers in 7 countries with governments classified as "authoritarian regimes" by The Economist [69]: Bahrain, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Qatar, Turkmenistan, UAE, Vietnam.

##### Additional FinSpy Samples

In parallel to our scanning, we obtained 9 samples of FinSpy by writing YARA [70] rules for the "malware hunting" feature of VirusTotal Intelligence. This feature sends us all newly-submitted samples that match our signatures. We located a version of FinSpy that does not use the normal FinSpy handshake but instead uses a protocol based on HTTP POST requests for communication with the C&C server. This did not appear to be an older or newer version of the protocol, suggesting that our scan results may not reveal the full scope of FinSpy C&C servers. Perhaps, the HTTP POST protocol was only delivered to a specific Gamma customer to meet a requirement.

##### Remote Control System (RCS)

We began by analyzing the UAE RCS sample from Ahmed and 6 samples obtained from VirusTotal by searching for AV results containing the strings "DaVinci" and "RCS." At the time, several AV vendors had added detection for RCS based on a sample analyzed by Dr. Web [71] and the UAE RCS sample sent to Ahmed. We also similarly obtained and analyzed samples of FSBSpy [72], a piece of malware that can report system information, upload screenshots, and drop and execute more malware. Based on these samples, we devised YARA signatures that yielded 23 additional samples of structurally similar malware.

##### Fingerprints

We probed the C&C servers of the RCS and FSBSpy samples and found that they responded in a distinctive way to HTTP requests and returned distinctive SSL certificates. We searched sources including Shodan, 5 Internet Census service probes [73], and Critical.IO scanning data [68] for the observed distinctive HTTP behavior. We searched for the distinctive SSL certificates in two Internet Census service probes.
