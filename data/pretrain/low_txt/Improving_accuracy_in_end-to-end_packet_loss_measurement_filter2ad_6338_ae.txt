### Comparison of BADABING and ZING Results

When comparing the results from BADABING with those from ZING under the same traffic conditions and probe rate, it is evident that BADABING provides loss frequency and duration estimates that are significantly closer to the true values.

### Practical Considerations for Using BADABING in Wide-Area Networks

Several practical issues must be addressed when deploying BADABING in a wide-area network:

1. **Parameter Selection (p and N):**
   - The tool requires users to specify values for the probe rate \( p \) and the number of probes \( N \). For the sake of this discussion, we assume that the number of loss events is stationary over time, although the duration of these events can vary almost arbitrarily.
   - Let \( L \) be the mean number of loss events per unit time. For instance, if an average of 12 loss events occur every minute and the discretization unit is 5 milliseconds, then \( L = \frac{12}{60 \times 200} = 0.001 \).
   - Under the stationarity assumption, the accuracy of our estimators depends on the product \( pNL \), not on the individual values of \( p \), \( N \), or \( L \). The standard deviation of the duration estimate can be approximated as:
     \[
     \text{StdDev(duration)} \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{pNL}}
     \]
   - The choice of \( p \) and \( N \) allows a trade-off between the timeliness of results and the impact on the link. Prior empirical studies can provide initial estimates of \( L \). Alternatively, continuous measurements can be taken, and results reported once validation techniques confirm the robustness of the estimation.

2. **Estimation of Duration:**
   - The accuracy of the duration estimate critically depends on correctly estimating the ratio \( B/M \) (as discussed in § 5). This ratio is estimated by counting the occurrence rates of \( y_i = 01 \) and \( y_i = 10 \), and their average gives \( B/M \). Validation is performed by measuring the difference between these two rates, which is directly proportional to the expected standard deviation of the estimation.

3. **Detection of Short-Lived Loss Episodes:**
   - Recent studies [25] indicate that loss episodes in backbone links can be very short-lived (e.g., several microseconds). To detect and estimate such short durations, the time discretization must be finer than the order of the duration being estimated. This may imply that commodity workstations may not be suitable for accurate active measurement in some scenarios, necessitating high-performance, specialized systems.

4. **Classification of Probe Path Congestion:**
   - The classification of whether a probe traversed a congested path depends not only on whether the probe was lost but also on the delay. While the appropriate \( \tau \) parameter is primarily dictated by \( p \), setting \( \alpha \) for arbitrary paths with unknown characteristics remains a challenge. Further investigation into the sensitivity of \( \tau \) and \( \alpha \) in complex environments is needed.

5. **Time Synchronization for End-to-End Delay:**
   - Accurate calculation of end-to-end delay for inferring congestion requires time synchronization of end hosts. While offset can be trivially eliminated, clock skew remains a concern. Techniques such as those reported in [26] or [38] can effectively address this issue.

### Summary, Conclusions, and Future Work

Our study aimed to understand how to accurately measure end-to-end packet loss characteristics using probes while specifying the impact on the bottleneck queue. We evaluated simple Poisson-modulated probing in a controlled laboratory environment and found it to be relatively ineffective, especially under TCP cross-traffic conditions.

This led to the development of BADABING, which provides more accurate estimation of loss characteristics. Our tests demonstrate that BADABING, in most cases, accurately estimates loss frequencies and durations under various cross-traffic conditions. For the same overall packet rate, BADABING is significantly more accurate than Poisson probing.

While BADABING offers superior accuracy and better understanding of link impact versus timeliness, there is still room for improvement. Future work includes adding adaptivity to the probe process model, exploring alternative parametric methods for inferring loss characteristics, and estimating the variability of congestion frequency and duration directly from measured data under minimal statistical assumptions.
