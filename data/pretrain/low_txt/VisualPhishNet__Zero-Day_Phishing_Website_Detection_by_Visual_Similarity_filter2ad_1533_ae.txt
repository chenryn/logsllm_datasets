## Supplementary Results

### Evaluation and Qualitative Results

We present supplementary results in the following figures:

- **Figure 13**: ROC curves for the binary classification task in the ablation study (discussed in subsection 6.2).

- **Figure 15**: Successful matching examples of newly crawled phishing pages (subsection 6.8).
- **Figure 16**: Correct matches across different websites with similar colors, which were still correctly distinguished (subsection 7.1).
- **Figure 17**: Successful examples where the website logo's colors and fonts differed from the trusted-list versions (subsection 7.3).

### Dataset Details and Examples

We provide more details about the VisualPhish dataset in the following figures:

- **Figure 18**: Histogram of the most targeted websites by the crawled phishing pages (section 4).
- **Figure 19**: Categories in the benign test set, constructed to reduce bias by having similar categories to the trusted websites (section 4).
- **Figure 20**: Examples of differences found between different browsers from the 50 pages used to evaluate the effect of browser differences (subsection 6.7).
- **Figure 21**: Examples of the test set used to test false positives when trusted logos are found in the page (subsection 7.1).
- **Figure 22**: Variations (e.g., designs, colors, and layout) of the dataset's phishing pages targeting one website.
- **Figure 23**: Examples of poorly designed (i.e., dissimilar to their targets) phishing pages.
- **Figure 24**: Examples of screenshots used in the online user study to evaluate dissimilar examples (discussed in subsection 7.2).
- **Figure 25**: Examples of newly crawled phishing pages to test the performance against zero-day pages (subsection 6.8).
