### Description
When viewing the DAG history in Tree View, individual DAG run times are displayed by hovering over the respective DAG run. As an Airflow user, I would like to see the average execution time readily available in the UI, specifically in the DAG -> Tree View section. This average could be calculated over the last _n_ runs, where _n_ is the number of runs selected in the Tree View.

### Use Case/Motivation
Having access to the average DAG run execution time can assist our team in making informed decisions, such as determining the optimal schedule interval for a DAG. This information will provide valuable insights into the performance and efficiency of our workflows.
