**Summary**

Motorola supports the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) general approach to promote the use of TV broadcast bands by unlicensed devices on most of the spectrum below TV channel 52. We believe that reasonable technical rules can be developed to minimize interference to incumbent operations. The spectrum made available through the Commission’s actions will benefit a variety of commercial and non-commercial broadband services, particularly in rural areas. However, Motorola recommends that the FCC adopt policies to enhance the usefulness and availability of this spectrum for public safety agencies and other critical uses, which would serve as a useful supplement to mission-critical systems operating in dedicated licensed spectrum allocations.

Motorola appreciates and supports the Commission’s decision to prohibit portable unlicensed devices on TV channels 14-20 to protect public safety operations in 13 markets across the country. Given the potential for disastrous consequences from interference, Motorola agrees with the Commission’s view that unlicensed use of the 470-512 MHz band should not be allowed until technology ensuring the protection of incumbent public safety licensees is fully developed, tested, and proven.

However, Motorola suggests that the Commission consider allowing limited and controlled use of the 470-512 MHz band by low-powered devices. This would enable public safety and other critical users, along with the industry serving them, to gain more experience and understanding of cognitive radio equipment in this environment. Specifically, Motorola recommends that the Commission allow public safety agencies and other critical users to deploy fixed and personal/portable low-power devices within the 470-512 MHz band, consistent with the technical standards established in this proceeding, on a nationwide basis. As further experience with the technology is gained, the Commission can review whether these eligibility restrictions remain necessary.

Such use of the 470-512 MHz band should be controlled and monitored. Operations would not be unlicensed but authorized “by rule” in the same manner that the FCC authorizes police departments to use radiolocation speed-determining devices without applying for a new license. To protect incumbent land mobile uses in the 470-512 MHz band, Motorola recommends establishing 145-kilometer exclusion zones around the 13 markets using these frequencies for land mobile services, a modest expansion of the FCC’s initial proposal of 134-kilometer exclusion zones.

In addition to establishing the 470-512 MHz band for public safety low-powered devices, the Commission should consider adopting priority access requirements for devices operating in other portions of the TV spectrum. Motorola recommends providing unconditional priority access to two VHF and two UHF channels from TV channels 7-25 for public safety and other critical users. During emergencies, these users should have the ability to preempt other users on these channels if necessary to meet critical communication requirements.

Motorola previously stated that it is premature to rely solely on spectrum sensing as a spectrum access method due to the difficulties in implementing sensing technology in this environment. Instead, we recommend that database and location information be the final source for determining whether to transmit. While Motorola believes that cognitive radios will inherently have sensing capabilities, it is unclear whether these capabilities can independently identify and protect licensed incumbents.

**I. Background and Summary**

This proceeding was initiated to promote more efficient and effective use of the spectrum allocated for television broadcast service by allowing the development and deployment of new types of unlicensed broadband devices and services for businesses and consumers. In developing its initial proposals, the Commission noted that significant bandwidth is available in the TV bands because multiple 6 MHz wide channels are generally vacant or unused in any particular area. To ensure no harmful interference to authorized users, the Commission proposed requiring unlicensed devices to comply with significant restrictions and technical protections, including the incorporation of “smart radio” or cognitive features to dynamically identify vacant spectrum.

With such protections, the Commission stated that unlicensed use of this spectrum could result in significant benefits for consumers and economic development for businesses by providing additional competition in the broadband market. In its comments submitted in response to the initial Notice, Motorola agreed that it would be technically feasible to have low-power unlicensed devices share spectrum with incumbent broadcasters without causing harmful interference to TV reception. However, Motorola expressed concern about unlicensed operation in TV spectrum shared by commercial and public safety land mobile operations. Motorola argued against unlicensed use of this shared spectrum until protection mechanisms ensuring interference-free unlicensed transmissions to mobile facilities are proven reliable. Specifically, Motorola recommended against permitting unlicensed operations on TV channels 14-20 (470-512 MHz) and TV channels 52-69 (698-806 MHz), which have been reallocated to public safety, commercial wireless, and band manager services.

The First Report and Order (R&O) adopted in October 2006 focused on the larger policy issues addressed by the original Notice. It adopted the general policy to allow the operation of fixed low-power devices on most TV channels beginning February 18, 2009, in areas where those frequencies are not being used for TV or other incumbent licensed services. Exempted from this general decision were TV channel 37, used by radio astronomy and wireless medical telemetry devices, and the reallocated TV channels 52-69. The First R&O did not allow any unlicensed operations (fixed or personal/portable) on these channels. Further, consistent with Motorola’s recommendations, the First R&O prohibited the use of unlicensed personal/portable devices on TV channels 14-20 due to the difficulties of coordinating unlicensed use with mobile services.

The Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Further Notice) was adopted concurrently with the First R&O. In this phase, the Commission seeks additional technical analyses to determine the answers to the following fundamental questions:

1. Can personal/portable devices operate in the TV broadcast band without causing harmful interference?
2. Should fixed unlicensed devices be permitted to operate on TV channels 14-20 in the 13 cities where these channels are used by public safety and other mobile services?
3. Should low-power devices authorized to operate in the TV band be permitted only on a licensed, rather than an unlicensed, basis, or should there be a hybrid licensing scheme?

The Further Notice also requests further comment on the methods that low-power devices may use to determine whether a portion of the TV band is unused at a specific time and location. Specifically, the Commission seeks additional comment on the technical viability of the following three methods, while offering specific technical proposals to implement these techniques:

- **Spectrum Sensing Approach:** An unlicensed device could have sensing capabilities incorporated into its equipment to detect whether other transmitters are operating in an area.
- **Geo-location/Database Approach:** The location of an unlicensed device is established by a professional installer or by the device itself using geo-location technology such as GPS. It could then be determined from either a local internal or remote external database whether the unlicensed device is located far enough outside the protected service contours of licensed television stations to avoid causing harmful interference.
- **Control Signal Approach:** An unlicensed device could receive information transmitted from an external source, such as a broadcast station or another unlicensed transmitter, indicating which channels are available at its geographic location.

Motorola supports the Commission’s efforts to expand the effective use of the TV broadcast spectrum by promoting the deployment of unlicensed and/or registered devices capable of operating on a non-interfering basis. The success of this policy depends on the development and performance of spectrum access methods that help ensure unlicensed devices operate only where protected incumbent facilities are not located. In this regard, Motorola has been actively participating in leading IEEE cognitive radio and coexistence standardization venues, including IEEE 802.22, IEEE P1900, and the SDR Forum.

In IEEE 802.22, Motorola has been instrumental in drafting the 802.22 baseline standard for fixed point-to-multipoint wireless broadband access in the TV white space. Motorola is also taking a leading role in the discussions in IEEE 802.22.1, a Task Group of IEEE 802.22, to draft a disabling beacon standard that offers enhanced protection to licensed and protected devices and services. To proactively address the critical need for proper, professional installation of fixed access base stations, Motorola participates as the vice-chair of Task Group IEEE 802.22.2, established to create a Recommended Practice for the installation of TV white space devices. In IEEE P1900, Motorola chairs the Task Group work that is developing methods and standards for the use of cognitive radio technology to select from among many standards available on a multi-frequency, multimode wireless network. In the SDR Forum, Motorola holds leadership positions in the development of software-defined radio technologies for advanced radio technologies. Motorola believes that the diverse standards venues are needed to solve the myriad of complex technological issues to make innovative services in the TV white space a reality.

In these comments, Motorola augments its previously filed comments in this proceeding, including updated analysis and recommendations on each of the spectrum access methods discussed in the Further Notice. Motorola intends to provide additional information to the FCC as work in the various IEEE forums described above progresses.

Motorola believes that the TV white space spectrum will be valuable for a variety of both commercial and non-commercial uses and that the ability to use this spectrum for unlicensed and registered devices while fully protecting services with higher regulatory priority will advance and improve over time. At this nascent stage of development, however, Motorola believes that it is appropriate for the Commission to proceed with some caution so that future opportunities are not diminished by haphazard early deployments.

Motorola recommends that the Commission adopt special provisions that would enhance the utility of TV white space spectrum for use by public safety and other critical users. For example, until the capabilities of spectrum access methods are fully proven, the Commission should limit the availability of TV white space on channels 14-20 to public safety and other critical users.
