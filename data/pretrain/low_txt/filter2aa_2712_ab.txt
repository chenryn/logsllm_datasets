### Overview of Windows Services
Windows services in Mac OS X Server include:
- Primary domain controller
- SMB file and print services
- Windows domain browsing
- Name resolution
- Virtual private network (VPN)

Mac OS X Server can provide various services to users of Microsoft Windows 95, 98, ME (Millennium Edition), XP, NT 4.0, and 2000, including:
- **File service**: Allows Windows clients to connect to the server using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol over TCP/IP.
- **Print service**: Uses SMB to allow Windows clients to print to PostScript printers on the network.
- **Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS)**: Enables name/address resolution across multiple subnets.
- **Domain browsing**: Allows Windows clients to browse for available servers across subnets.
- **Virtual private network (VPN)**: Enables secure connections to Mac OS X Server from remote locations.
- **Primary domain controller (PDC)**: Supports:
  - Logins from Windows NT 4.x, Windows 2000, and Windows XP workstations
  - Password changes during login
  - Single user account for both Mac OS X and Windows computers
  - Roaming user profiles stored on a Mac OS X Server computer
  - Network home directories located on a Mac OS X Server computer
  - User-level security for Windows 95, 98, and ME clients

By providing these services, Mac OS X Server can replace Windows NT servers in small workgroups. Settings for Windows services are grouped in Workgroup Manager and Server Admin for easy access and familiarity to experienced Windows administrators.

### Windows Services Based on Samba 3
Windows services in Mac OS X Server are based on Samba 3, an open-source SMB/CIFS server. For more information, visit:

### Providing a PDC for Domain Login
Setting up your Mac OS X Server as a Windows primary domain controller (PDC) enables domain logins for Windows users on your network. Users can log in with a single user name and password defined on the PDC, eliminating the need for local accounts on each workstation. A PDC allows users to change their passwords during login and provides a unified login experience for both Windows and Mac OS X computers.

Before setting up a PDC, you must configure the server as an Open Directory master. The PDC uses the user and computer information stored in the LDAP directory of the Open Directory master. You can set up an Open Directory master and a PDC using Server Assistant after installing Mac OS X Server, or by using Server Admin post-installation.

Ensure only one Mac OS X Server is configured as a PDC on your network, although multiple Open Directory masters can exist.

### Providing Home Directories and Roaming User Profiles
A Windows PDC can host home directories and roaming user profiles for Windows users. Each user has a network home directory accessible from any Windows workstation or Mac OS X computer. Roaming profiles store user preferences such as screensavers, colors, backgrounds, event sounds, and web cookies in a share point on the PDC.

### Joining a PDC as a Domain Member
If you have multiple Mac OS X Servers, you can set one as a PDC and others as domain members. Domain member servers use the PDC for user authentication and can host home directories and roaming user profiles.

### Providing File, Print, Browsing, and Name Resolution Services
You can set up Mac OS X Server to provide:
- **File service**: Access to share points via SMB.
- **Print service**: SMB access to PostScript printers.
- **WINS name resolution**: For Windows clients.
- **Network browsing service**: As a workgroup or domain master browser.

### Providing VPN Service
A Mac OS X Server virtual private network (VPN) can include Windows workstations and Mac OS X computers. The server uses Microsoftâ€™s Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (MS-CHAPv2) for authentication and supports Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) and Layer Two Tunneling Protocol, Secure Internet Protocol (L2TP/IPSec).

### Tools for Managing Windows Services
- **Workgroup Manager and Server Admin**: Provide graphical interfaces for managing Windows services.
- **Command-Line Tools**: Available for administrators who prefer command-driven server administration. Use Terminal for remote server management via Secure Shell (SSH).

### Setting Up Windows Services
You can set up Mac OS X Server as:
- **Standalone Windows services provider**
- **Windows domain member**
- **Primary domain controller**

To set up standalone Windows services:
1. Open Server Admin and select Windows for the server in the Computers & Services list.
2. Click Settings, then General.
3. Choose Standalone Server from the Role pop-up menu and enter a description, computer name, and workgroup.
   - **Description**: Optional, appears in the Network Neighborhood window.
   - **Computer Name**: NetBIOS name, up to 15 characters, no special characters.
   - **Workgroup**: Up to 15 characters, should match a Windows domain if applicable.
4. Click Save.

For detailed configurations, refer to the sections on changing Windows services access, logging, and advanced settings, as well as the print service administration guide.

### From the Command Line
For command-line administration, use Terminal and SSH for remote management.
