### Rootkit Detection
- **Against Hooking**
  - There are many hooking techniques, but we focus on the most common ones used by spyware authors.
    - **Kernel Mode Hook**: SSDT Hooking
    - **User Mode Hook**: IAT Hooking, EAT Hooking, Inline Hooking

- **Hidden Process Detection**
  - We use the "Process Handle Tracking Approach" to detect hidden processes such as Hxdef, Fu, AFX, vanquish, and other rootkits. In the next version of Archon, we will add a new approach to detect hidden processes using FuTo.
  - Hidden objects can be easily discovered with the Cross-View approach.

### Detecting Injected DLLs
- **Theoretical Challenge**
  - It is theoretically impossible to determine which DLL is injected into a process without behavior monitoring, as all critical evidence disappears after injection.
- **Other Clues**
  - Find all explicitly loaded DLLs using LDR Information (PEB -> LDR Table)
  - IAT Scanning
  - Malicious PE Check: Packer Analysis

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Elements
- **Types of IDS**
  - Guard → Person
  - NIDS → IP (Session)
  - Anti-Virus → File
  - HIPS/Personal Firewall → Process

- **Challenges in Detection**
  - **DLL Injection Spyware?**
  - **Code Injection Spyware?**
  - **Kernel Mode Spyware?**
  - **Rootkit?**
  - We need more precise answers!

- **Automated Behavior Analysis Approach, Birdman, HIT2006**

### Malicious Behavior Set
- **Tracking Relationships**
  - To cover all malicious behaviors, including remote threading and DLL injection, we track the relationship between processes and threads to identify the "Malicious Behavior Set."

- **Automated Behavior Analysis Approach, Birdman, HIT2006**

### Automated Malicious Behavior Analyzer
- **Need for Automation**
  - We need an automated analyzer to profile the malicious behavior of spyware.
- **Implementation**
  - To capture all user-mode spyware behavior, we have developed a pure kernel-mode monitor, the Archon Analyzer.
  - **Behavior Monitor:**
    - Process and Thread Tracking
    - File Dropping Monitor
    - Remote Threading Monitor
    - Process Memory Access Monitor
    - Registry Access Monitor
    - Networking Monitor

- **Automated Behavior Analysis Approach, Birdman, HIT2006**

### Virtual Lab for Spyware Analysis
- **Virtual Lab Setup**
  - The virtual lab consists of the Archon Analyzer and a VM Sandbox.
  - **Benefits:**
    - Automated
    - Efficient
  - **VM Sandbox**

- **Automated Behavior Analysis Approach, Birdman, HIT2006**

### Case Study: DLL Injection
- **Injection Targets**
  - Injects into IE and spoolsv.exe
- **Driver and Rootkit**
  - Drops EXE, shell32.exe, and xyztmp2.exe
  - Winlogon Notification: Wlogntiy.dll (Autorun!)

- **Case Study 2 (1/2)**
- **Automated Behavior Analysis Approach, Birdman, HIT2006**

### Network Traffic Recording
- **Archon Analyzer Features**
  - Records TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic.
  - **DNS Query Example:**
    - www.baidu.com

- **Case Study 2 (2/2)**
- **Automated Behavior Analysis Approach, Birdman, HIT2006**

### Case Study: Code Injection
- **Sophisticated Tricks**
  - This case study reveals sophisticated code injection techniques that do not drop any files on the disk, making them difficult to detect.
  - **Shellcode and EXE File**
    - Overwrites IE memory directly with a whole EXE image.
  - **Anti-Virus Limitations**
    - No file to detect!

- **Case Study 3 (1/2)**
- **Automated Behavior Analysis Approach, Birdman, HIT2006**

### Behavior Analysis
- **EXE Image Copy**
  - Copies a whole EXE image into IE.

- **Case Study 3 (2/2)**
- **DNS Queries**
  - kimo.2288.org
  - ns1.3322.net
- **Spyware Log File**

### Scanner vs. Analyzer
- **Archon Scanner**
  - **Environment**: Works in the wild (uncontrolled environment)
  - **Focus**: Finding unknown malicious software
  - **Role**: Behavior Scanner, Forensic Tool

- **Archon Analyzer**
  - **Environment**: Works in the zoo (controlled environment)
  - **Focus**: Analyzing malicious behavior of specific targets
  - **Role**: Behavior Monitor, Software Malicious Behavior Testing Tool, Lab Tool

- **Automated Behavior Analysis Approach, Birdman, HIT2006**

### Conclusion
- **Real Dangers of Spyware**
  - The threat of spyware is very real, and rootkit technology is the latest trend in hiding spyware from users and anti-spyware software. Information theft and data compromise can go unnoticed for days, weeks, or even months. Through personal policies and the latest technology, you can actively protect your company's network and stand against malware.
