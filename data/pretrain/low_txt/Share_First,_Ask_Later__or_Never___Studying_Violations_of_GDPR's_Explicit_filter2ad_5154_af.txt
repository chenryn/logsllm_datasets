### Email Notification Template

**Subject: GDPR Compliance and User Consent in Your Mobile App**

Dear $developer team,

We are a team of academic researchers from $affiliation, conducting a research project on user consent and GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation) compliance of mobile apps. Please note that this email is part of an academic research project and is not intended to sell any products or services.

As part of our analysis, we investigated the sharing of users' personal information (e.g., IP addresses, persistent identifiers, tracking identifiers) with third-party services for personalized or behavioral advertising. Our analysis indicates that your app shares some personal user information with such services without obtaining prior explicit consent from users.

We have prepared a detailed report on our methodology, the data being sent, and the parties involved. You can access this through our (password-protected) web interface at $report_url (please do not publish this URL as it is personalized for your app).

By analyzing the legal documents (e.g., terms of service, privacy policies, developer guidelines, and contracts) provided by the third-party services, we concluded that your app might be non-compliant with the GDPR's consent requirements. To be legally compliant, an app must obtain explicit consent from users in the European Union before sharing their personal data with third parties for personalized ads, if those third parties act as data controllers.

Please note that we do not offer a conclusive legal assessment or consultancy on individual app compliance, as there might be alternative lawful bases for data sharing with third parties other than consent.

As this email is part of a research project aimed at understanding GDPR compliance issues in mobile apps, we would greatly appreciate your feedback on the following questions:

1. Were you aware of the types of data being collected and transmitted when you included third-party SDKs in your app? Did you know that these types of data could be considered personal data under the GDPR?
2. Are there specific reasons why your app does not implement explicit consent?
3. Do you plan to make any changes to address the outlined issues? What type of support (e.g., documentation or automated tools) would be beneficial for you?

If you have further questions or wish not to receive any further communication, please contact us, and we will diligently follow your request.

Best regards,
$researchers

### Manual Version Analysis

**Dear $developer team,**

We are a team of academic researchers from $affiliation, conducting a research project on user consent and GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation) compliance of mobile apps. Please note that this email is part of an academic research project and is not meant to sell any products or services.

To conduct our analysis, we first examined the app network traffic to identify parameters indicating the SDK version. These parameters include:
- unity3d.com (x-unity-version, sdkversion, sdk_version_name, sdk_ver, sdkversion)
- flurry.com (fl.sdk.version.code)
- vungle.com (user-agent, sdk)
- my.com (mytracker_ver)
- amazon-adsystem.com (adsdk)

We then manually verified the results with the identified SDKs' release notes. Using this information, we detected the versions of all apps that sent personal data (PD).

**Note:** 
- Under GDPR, developers are required to obtain end-user consent before sending data via the SDK.
- Some companies provide APIs for opt-in and opt-out.
- Some companies are GDPR-compliant based on "legitimate interest."
- For certain SDKs, providing disclosure for using the SDK is necessary.
- Some default behaviors may be considered bad practice.
- NinthDecimal is now blocking all ad requests from affected EEA regions.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
