At the bottom of the Quickstart page, there is a link titled "Sharing your Localhost Server with Localtunnel." This link directs to a page that contains outdated information about Localtunnel. The current version of Localtunnel can be found [here](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) or on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel). Additionally, Localtunnel is now installed via `npm`, not `gem`. 

For clarity and accuracy, the Quickstart page should be updated to reflect these changes.
