### 3. Time-of-Use Pricing Schemes and Cost Savings

The study evaluated the NILL system under three time-of-use pricing schemes: Orange and Rockland (New York, USA), Ontario Power Generation (Ontario, Canada), and Pacific Gas and Electric (California, USA). The simulations demonstrated cost savings ranging from 1.8% to 5.2%, primarily due to the battery's ability to shift peak load into off-peak hours. It is important to note that energy prices in California are significantly higher compared to the other regions, resulting in cost savings that are approximately double those observed in the upper-mid Atlantic and Ontario regions. The cost savings of $2 to $10 per day can partially offset the costs associated with the NILL system.

### 4. Long-Term Costs and Battery Maintenance

In addition to the initial cost savings, the long-term cost of a NILL system includes the maintenance and replacement of the battery. Under a NILL scheme, a lead-acid battery operated at a depth of discharge (DOD) between 50% to 80% can be expected to last between 500 to 1,000 cycles, which equates to one or two years [7]. To extend the battery's lifetime, one approach is to use the NILL system only when occupants are at home. Further research will focus on reducing the frequency of battery cycles to enhance the overall system longevity.

### 5. Optimizing NILL Parameters

The NILL system's performance depends on several key parameters. While some parameters, such as the calculation of KSS, have been guided by established methods, others, like KH, KL, and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) parameter α, were chosen based on expert knowledge. In practice, these parameters should be selected using set rules to ensure optimal performance.

- **KL Value**: The KL value, chosen during a low recovery state, allows the battery to recharge quickly to just below its maximum state of charge (SOC) (80% in our experiments). For many lead-acid batteries, optimal lifetime and performance can be achieved by recharging to between 50% and 80% SOC at a high rate, and then throttling back to charge to between 90% to 100% [13].
- **KH Value**: KH was selected based on the previous few data points from the net load. This results in a low discharge from the battery, but it is not guaranteed to be minimal. Since lead-acid batteries perform best at a high SOC, KH should be chosen to maximize efficient performance.
- **EWMA Parameter (α)**: The EWMA was used to adapt KSS over time as the net load caused recovery states. A better choice of KSS can maintain a steady state for a longer period. Although we achieved good results with α = 0.5, this heuristic may not work under all conditions. A full implementation should consider techniques such as minimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### 6. Power Signatures and Disaggregation

Two NILM techniques that pose challenges to NILL are power signature analysis and load disaggregation.

- **Power Signature Analysis**: This technique involves collecting high-resolution data to detect unique appliance signatures. For example, the turn-on transient in demand when starting a motor [35, 41] or the power signatures in loads with small capacitance, such as fluorescent lighting and electronic devices [40]. This method requires accurate measurements with a sampling rate of at least 600 samples per second and a resolution of tenths of amps. In extreme cases, MHz sampling rates can characterize the line noise caused by different appliances during transitional phases [32]. However, modern residential smart meters do not support the necessary sampling rate or computation, making this technique impractical in most residential settings.
- **Load Disaggregation**: This technique attempts to identify the set of appliance loads contributing to the net load by solving a discrete knapsack problem. Although initially considered computationally impractical [12], recent advancements have made it feasible for residential loads [20]. In the context of NILL, the battery represents an unknown quantity in the knapsack problem. At one-watt resolution, there are thousands of possible values for the battery quantity, many of which will have valid solutions. Therefore, load disaggregation-based NILMs are not a significant threat to the privacy provided by NILL.

### 7. Conclusions

We introduced a new class of privacy-preserving algorithms called non-intrusive load leveling (NILL). NILL obscures privacy-exposing NILM algorithms by removing the majority of useful energy use transitions sensed by smart meters. Simulations of NILL over real usage profiles in four homes showed that between 1.1 and 5.9 meaningful events were exposed to NILM algorithms per day. These features are embedded among hundreds or thousands of false events, making the recovery of appliance profiles virtually impossible with current algorithms. Future efforts will explore trade-offs between different battery systems and the integration with existing in-home alternative energy generation technology.

### Appendix

#### A. Future NILM Algorithms

The analysis in the previous section considered currently available NILM algorithms. Future approaches will likely employ more powerful machine learning and data mining techniques. Consider the threat models of as-yet-unknown NILM algorithms that may use features more effectively or exploit knowledge of NILL to expose energy usage. Specifically, the NILM algorithms considered thus far have been oblivious to the potential presence of NILL. This raises the question: Could a NILM aware of the operations of a NILL algorithm recover more information about the actual demand \( d \) from the observed demand \( u \) than a basic feature-based NILM? While the answer is almost certainly yes, it is currently unclear how this inference could be done or how it could be countered.

#### A.1 Feature Correlation

In the evaluation, we observed that there are features in \( u \) that do not overlap with those visible in \( d \), i.e., the non-residual features. To a basic steady-state NILM, these features reveal little to nothing about the appliance that caused the feature. An adversarial NILM, however, may be able to learn a mapping from some of the features present only in \( u \) to those in \( d \). This can be done under three separate circumstances:

1. **Pre-NILL Installation**: If the NILL system was installed before the NILM, there is no non-NILL data available for training, forcing the NILM to first cluster features from the NILL load profile. If a correlation is found between the NILL clustering and clusters for known appliance features, a mapping may potentially be found between the two sets.
2. **Post-NILL Installation**: In this scenario, NILL is installed after NILM, revealing both NILL and non-NILL load profiles over mutually exclusive time spans. This allows a differential analysis of the pre- and post-NILL data. Similar to the previous case, the NILM must find the clustering of the NILL data that most closely matches that of the non-NILL data. Any assumption about the significance of such a correlation can be further leveraged by NILL algorithms to cause false inference by the adversary.
3. **Overlapping Samples**: In the least likely yet most advantageous scenario for the adversary, there may be temporally overlapping NILL and non-NILL samples. If the non-identical features in these two sample sets are highly correlated, a linear mapping from NILL to non-NILL would give a fair approximation of the mapping between features. Once again, a NILM’s reliance on any such mapping could be leveraged by NILL to cause false positive appliance classifications by adding random noise or phantom features.

#### A.2 Inference from NILL Internal State

It has been shown that the high-level behavior of cyber-physical systems can be determined based on their low-level signaling [36]. Similarly, adversarial NILMs may attempt to infer properties of the NILL system’s internal state based on features in the NILL load profile. For example, a sudden spike in feature mass is likely indicative of a low recovery state. A low recovery state, in turn, reveals the state of the battery, i.e., that the state of charge \( c \leq L \) and the rate of charge \( b(t) > 0 \). Once the state is known at a point in time, it is possible to determine the state at any future time by observing transitions in the target load. The question remains whether an adversarial NILM can infer more about \( d \) from knowing the internal system state and \( u \), than from knowing \( u \) alone.

To infer anything about \( d \) beyond the features already overlapping with \( u \), the NILM must know something about \( b \), because \( u - b = d \). But can anything be implied about \( b \) from knowing NILL’s internal state? The previous example demonstrated that in the low recovery scenario, it is known that \( b > 0 \) and likely close to the battery’s maximum safe charge rate. However, as was shown experimentally in Section 4.4, there is already a high residual feature mass (RFM) during a low recovery state, making the overlap between \( d \) and \( u \) fairly substantial. Whether the remainder of features in \( u \) reveal information about \( d \) during a recovery scenario is left to future analysis.

If the NILL is in steady state, then \( b \) may be either positive or negative, depending completely on \( KSS - d \). Thus, it seems highly unlikely that a NILM can make inferences based on knowing that the NILL is in steady state. Finally, in a high recovery scenario, \( KH \) is chosen to be slightly below the most recent several \( d \) values, allowing the battery to discharge at a low rate. In this case, it is known that \( b < 0 \), and that \( KH - d \) is fairly small. While this is an indication that \( d \) is a light load for the duration of the high recovery state, it reveals only the general size of appliances, but not specific information as to which appliances or whether they are automatic or manually operated.
