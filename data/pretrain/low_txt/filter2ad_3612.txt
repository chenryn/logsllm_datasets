**Overview:**

The Workshop on Architecting Dependable Systems (WADS) continues the initiative that began four years ago to bring together the international communities of dependability and software architecture. The first WADS was organized during the 2002 International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE). Since then, five additional workshops have been held, and three books have been published (http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/wads). A significant milestone was achieved in 2004 with the Twin Workshops, which were held concurrently at ICSE 2004 and DSN 2004.

These workshops have proven to be a fertile ground for both communities, facilitating the clarification of approaches that have been tried and succeeded, as well as those that have not yet shown success. This not only helps avoid reinventing the wheel but also highlights and promotes areas where the most promising research may lie.

**Workshop Program:**

The workshop program will promote discussions on architecting dependable systems by focusing on two key questions:
1. What are the architectural principles involved in building dependable systems?
2. How should these architectures be evaluated?

**Objectives and Topics:**

The primary aim of the workshop is to convene the communities of software architecture and dependability to discuss the current state of research and practice in addressing dependability issues at the architectural level. We welcome submissions from both industry and academia on all topics related to software architectures for dependable systems. These include, but are not limited to:

- Dependability modeling in software architectures
- Verification and validation (including model checking) of dependable software architectures
- Adaptable architectures for achieving dependability
- Architectural support for self-healing, self-repairing, and self-stabilizing systems
- Run-time checks of architectural models
- Dependability evaluation in software architectures
- Architectural patterns for dependable systems
- Exception handling in software architectures
- Redundancy and diversity at the architectural level
- Dependable architectures and implementation
