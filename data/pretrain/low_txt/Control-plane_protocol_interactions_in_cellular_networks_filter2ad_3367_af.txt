### Seamless Transition Between 3G and 4G Networks

To ensure a seamless transition between 3G and 4G networks, the two systems must enforce proper handover mechanisms. We recommend removing a specific detach condition in the standard. This condition is triggered when a user device, without an active Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context, switches from 3G to 4G. Instead of detaching, the device should immediately activate the Evolved Packet System (EPS) bearer after the inter-system switch, ensuring a smooth transition (§5.1).

In the event of failures in one system, the other system should assist in recovery if possible. For example, in the second issue (§6.3), the 4G Mobility Management Entity (MME) should not detach the user device upon a 3G location update failure. Instead, it should recover the device's location update with the 3G Mobile Switching Center (MSC) on behalf of the device. The standard does not stipulate that the MME should detach the user device upon a 3G failure, and we suggest that operators eliminate this practice.

### Prototype and Evaluation

#### Control Plane Prototype

We developed a prototype to demonstrate the solution and evaluate its effectiveness. The control plane functions were implemented at three major components: the user device, base station, and core network. A programmable Android phone was used as the user device, and two commercial machines (Lenovo X230) emulated the base station and core network. Our prototype is based on our own proof-of-concept 3G/4G stacks, as operational stacks are not accessible.

The connectivity management (CC/SM/ESM) and mobility management (MM/GMM/EMM) modules were implemented at both the user device and the core network. For connectivity management, the functions include CS/PS service establishment/release and the activation/deactivation of PDP context/EPS bearer. The mobility management module provides attach/detach, location update, and signaling establishment for SM/CM/ESM. The Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer was also implemented at the device and base station. Since RRC transmission is unreliable, we used UDP to emulate it. TCP was used to forward RRC payloads between the base station and the core network, assuming reliable transmission. All functions were implemented in the application layer.

#### Layer Extension

Our reliable shim layer, as described in §8, prevents detachment caused by duplicate or lost EMM signaling messages. To emulate the loss of EMM messages, the RRC at the base station drops messages according to a given drop rate. In each test, the user device performed 100 attach and tracking area updates. Figure 12 (left) shows the number of detaches varying with the drop rate, with and without our solution. Without the solution, detaches increase linearly with the drop rate, while with our solution, there are no detaches even as the drop rate increases.

To decouple the location update from the CS service, both the device and core network’s MM create two threads to handle them concurrently. The location update and PS service for GMM are also decoupled in the same way. We examined the CS/PS service delay incurred by the location update in MM/GMM. Only the CS service results are shown, as the PS service results are similar. The MM function is configured to perform a location update every 30 seconds. When the location update is triggered, CM at the user device immediately triggers a call service through MM. Figure 12 (right) shows the call service delay at MM varying with the processing time of the location update. Without our solution, the service delay increases linearly with the processing time. However, our solution eliminates this delay by using two threads to handle location update and call service concurrently.

#### Domain Decoupling

We decoupled the CS/PS services in two ways. First, we applied different modulations (channels) to CS and PS traffic. Since we had no BS access, we used WiFi Rate Adaptation (RA) to emulate 16QAM and 64QAM modulation. This was approximated using 48 Mbps and 24 Mbps rates in 802.11a. Figure 13 shows the speeds for voice and data in both coupled and decoupled cases. Voice traffic was generated using Skype's VoIP calls. The speed of data traffic improved by about 1.6 times for both downlink and uplink in the decoupled case, while the voice was carried by a robust modulation. The difference in speeds between voice and data in the coupled case is due to the small packet size of voice, which incurs more overhead.

Second, to prevent CSFB inter-system switching from being blocked in the PS domain, we added a new function to the BS’s RRC. This function asks the user device to switch its RRC state to a proper state for inter-system switching once the CSFB procedure is initiated. It was verified that the user device’s CSFB switching was never blocked with our solution.

#### Cross-System Coordination

We prototyped two remedies for cross-system coordination between 3G and 4G. First, the user device always activates the EPS bearer if it does not have an active PDP context after inter-system 3G→4G switching. This was tested in a scenario where the user device, without a PDP context, switched from 3G to 4G. The remedy prevented the device from being detached, reducing the switch time to 0.1-0.4s (median 0.27s). Without the remedy, the switch took 0.3-1.3s (median 0.9s) due to re-attachment to the 4G network. This delay can be much larger due to more complicated procedures or heavy loading at the operator’s core network, observed to be as large as 24.7s (§5.1).

In the second remedy, the MME takes two actions upon receiving a 3G location update failure message for a user device. First, it does not forward the failure message to the device. Second, it triggers the recovery process by updating the device’s location with the 3G MSC. It was verified that the MME does not detach the user device upon a 3G location update failure and recovers the device by updating its location with the MSC later.

### Related Work

Cellular networking has been an active research area in recent years. Studies have reported inappropriate cellular network operations, including the interplay between applications and cellular infrastructure [9,14], TCP over cellular data forwarding [13], mutual interference between data and voice [27], and misbehaviors in cellular functions [21,22,26]. Our work differs from these studies, focusing on the control plane rather than the data plane, and involving both devices and infrastructure elements.

Protocol verification has been investigated for Internet protocols [12,17,19,24], with new techniques developed for complex scenarios. For example, [18] presents SAT-based data-plane debugging, [10] enhances OpenFlow application debugging with symbolic execution of event handlers, and header space analysis is applied for testing complex interactions between various Internet protocols [15]. Our study is orthogonal to these efforts, focusing on protocol verification for cellular networks.

Formal model analysis has been applied to individual cellular protocols. [20] verifies the 2G handover protocol using a generic mobility model with π-calculus, and [25] models the authentication protocol, identifying several security loopholes. Our work differs in both problem and solution approach, studying protocol interactions and employing two-phase verification.

### Conclusion

In 3G/4G cellular networks, control-plane protocols are more complex than their Internet counterparts, operating in diversified usage settings and supporting additional functions such as mobility, data, and carrier-grade voice. Inter-protocol signaling is widespread across layers, domains, and systems. Some interactions are poorly designed or improperly operated, leading to functional incorrectness and performance degradation. These issues can get mobile users stuck in 3G or deny them 4G access.

Three domain-specific lessons were learned from our work:
1. In cross-layer cases, well-tested layering rules from the Internet should be honored. If the lower layer does not provide certain functions, the higher layer must do so or be prepared to work without them. Coupling inter-layer actions is not advisable unless properly justified.
2. In cross-domain cases, signaling design should recognize inter-domain differences. Treating domains identically simplifies design but can be error-prone.
3. In cross-system cases, failure messages can be shared and acted upon between systems, but it is better not to expose failure-handling operations outside the system unless absolutely necessary.

Research on control-plane protocols in cellular networks warrants more effort. 3G/4G is a critical infrastructure, and more research is needed to enhance and simplify signaling design, complementing studies on the Internet counterpart.
