**Title: U.S. 2020 Election Security: Securing America's Future**

The United States Government is deeply committed to ensuring the security of our elections and is collaborating with election partners more effectively than ever before. The Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is spearheading the federal effort to assist state and local officials in their critical mission to secure the 2020 elections. CISA is sharing intelligence, resources, support, and cybersecurity services to protect election infrastructure from malicious activities.

Since 2017, federal, state, local, and private sector partners have been fortifying our defenses and preparing for the 2020 elections. We are aware that this election will be a target for adversaries, but we are well-trained, exercised, and ready to meet these challenges.

While preparing for known threats, our nation has also had to confront an additional challenge in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has required election officials to make rapid operational decisions to ensure the safe, healthy, and secure conduct of elections during the pandemic. CISA and its partners have quickly adapted to provide the necessary support and resources, helping officials find effective and secure ways to conduct elections in these unprecedented times.
