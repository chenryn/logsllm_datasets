### UE Re-synchronization with AUSF

At this stage, the UE re-synchronizes with the AUSF. We investigate the delays introduced by `sync_failures` using our testbed. Figure 9 illustrates the probability distribution function (PDF) of the delays to connection completion for UEs that hold identical SUPIs and attempt to authenticate simultaneously. To simulate a large number of simultaneous authentication requests, we used OpenAirInterface5G [53] to create 100 simulated UEs. Our observations indicate that the first successful UE typically takes approximately 200 ms to connect, while subsequent UEs experiencing `sync_failures` encounter additional delays. In our relatively small experiment, all UEs successfully connected to the network within 1.1 seconds.

In a large-scale production network, the number of UEs attempting to connect simultaneously would be significantly larger. PGPP-based networks can mitigate this issue by deploying more AUSFs, thereby reducing the number of UEs each AUSF is responsible for. The push towards 5G will facilitate this, as core network entities are being redesigned to be virtualized and located closer to UEs.

### Related Work

Previous research on anonymous communications often balanced latency and anonymity [16, 17, 48, 73]. Similarly, Tor [23], TORFone [28], and Mixnets [11] also increase latency to enhance anonymity. Prior work has also focused on applying mixing techniques in traditional telephony networks [56, 57]. However, such solutions are not suitable for cellular systems, which, apart from SMS, require low latency. Additionally, the current architecture continues to use identifiers (e.g., SUPI) that can expose users to IMSI catcher attacks or enable location tracking by the operator. Heuser et al. proposed Phonion [32], which aims to separate call setup from call delivery to nullify the value of call data records (CDRs). PGPP, on the other hand, reduces individually identifying information in CDRs. Authenticall [63] provides content integrity and endpoint authentication for calls but does not aim to add privacy within the infrastructure.

There has been extensive prior work on identifying security and privacy issues in cellular networks [35, 44, 49, 65, 68]. We decouple the SUPI from the subscriber by setting it to a single value for all users in the network. Modifying the SUPI (or IMSI) to thwart IMSI catchers and similar passive attacks has been previously proposed [4, 41, 70, 72]. These techniques use pseudo-IMSIs (PMSIs), which are kept synchronized between the SIM and the AUSF, or hypothetical virtual SIMs, allowing for user identification. Our goal is to go beyond thwarting IMSI catchers and address active attacks without requiring fundamental changes to the UE; we aim to protect users from the operator itself.

Hussain et al. introduced the TORPEDO attack [36], which allows attackers to identify the page frame index and, consequently, the presence or absence of a victim in a paging broadcast area (i.e., a tracking area). However, our use of tracking area lists to provide additional paging anonymity (Section 4.2) increases the potential locations where a victim could be, thus reducing the effectiveness of third-party paging-related localization attacks. The authors also defined the PIERCER attack, which enables an attacker to reveal a victim’s IMSI with only their phone number. PGPP mitigates this attack by making all SUPIs identical. Multiple studies have shown that cellular signaling protocols leave users' privacy vulnerable to attack [24, 43, 51, 55, 67]. Our initial design avoids signaling protocol vulnerabilities by providing data-only services rather than voice/SMS, and roaming to other networks can be enabled by requiring home-routing rather than local breakout. Hussain et al. identified a 5G vulnerability that allows an attacker to neutralize GUTI refreshment [37]. However, this requires a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack (e.g., IMSI catcher), which means the attacker already knows the victim’s location. Additionally, the GUTI is a temporary identifier and is not associated with a specific user.

Choudhury and Køien have proposed altering IMSI values, but both approaches require substantial changes to network entities [15, 42]. We argue that a privacy-preserving architecture must be fully compatible with existing infrastructure, given that the global telecom infrastructure is a network of networks, comprising multiple operators that connect via well-known APIs.

### Concluding Remarks

User privacy is a highly debated topic, especially as law enforcement organizations, particularly in authoritarian states, demand increasingly ubiquitous surveillance. Law enforcement has long demanded backdoor access to private user devices and user data [66].

We believe that, in its current form, PGPP users would not be able to withstand targeted legal or extralegal attacks by nation-state organizations (e.g., the FBI or NSA). However, PGPP would likely limit the ability of any organization to continue mass surveillance of user mobility. A more common and problematic form of privacy loss today is the surreptitious sale of user data by network providers, which PGPP addresses in a manner that aligns with user autonomy. Our aim is to improve privacy in line with prior societal norms and user expectations, and to present an approach in which privacy-enhanced service can be seamlessly deployed.
