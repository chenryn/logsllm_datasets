## What is Online Poker

### Online Poker Timeline
- **Early 1990s**: IRC Poker is the first virtual poker.
- **1998**: Planet Poker launches, becoming the first real money site.
- **1999**: Kahnawake Gaming Commission regulations introduced.
- **2000**: UB Launches.
- **2001**: Party Poker and PokerStars launch.
- **2003**: Chris Moneymaker wins the World Series of Poker, sparking the poker boom.
- **2004**: Full Tilt Poker launches.
- **2005**: Online poker becomes a $2 billion industry.
- **2006**: Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) passed.
- **2007**: UB/AP cheating scandal.
- **2010**: Online poker industry reaches $6 billion.
- **2011**: "Black Friday" – DOJ seizes major poker sites.

### Current Events
- The Department of Justice (DOJ) has seized several poker sites, including PokerStars, Full Tilt, UB/Absolute, and Doyles Room, on charges of illegal gambling and money laundering.
- PokerStars has paid out players, but other sites have not.
- Development of new features and functionality is currently on hold.

### Revenue and Regulation
- The online poker industry generates significant revenue, but there is little regulation or compliance.
- Some sites, like Party Poker, do not allow players from the USA and are regulated and taxed in certain countries (e.g., UK).
- There is a need for comprehensive compliance and regulation to ensure the safety and integrity of online poker in the USA.

## Flop: Past Vulnerabilities

### Random Number Generator (RNG) Vulnerability
- **1999**: A vulnerability in the shuffling algorithm used by PlanetPoker was documented. The algorithm, developed by ASF Software, only allowed for 4 billion possible shuffles, significantly fewer than the 52! (approximately 2^226) possible unique shuffles in a real deck.
- **Modern Practices**: Companies now have their RNGs audited by reputable third parties. For example, PokerStars uses an RNG that has been verified by Cigital, a leading software security firm.

### UB/Absolute Super User Issue
- **2004-2008**: Cheating occurred when a tool called "god mode" was implemented, allowing someone to see all hole cards on the site and feed the information to others.
- **Impact**: 23 accounts, 117 usernames, and $22 million in losses.
- **Lessons Learned**: Importance of configuration management, separation of duties, code reviews, SDLC, and auditing.

### SSL Exploit
- **2010**: An SSL exploit was discovered by Poker Table Ratings, where data could be decrypted using XOR operations instead of proper SSL encryption.
- **Resolution**: Fixed within 11 days, affecting UB/Absolute and Cake network.

### Account Compromise
- Various instances of account compromise have been reported, highlighting the need for robust security measures.

### Poker Bots
- **Evolution**: Poker bots have become more sophisticated due to advancements in artificial intelligence.
- **Techniques**: Modern poker bots use techniques such as windowing, GDI, Windows Hooks, kernel objects, DLL injection, API instrumentation, inter-process communication, multithreading, and simulating user input.

## Turn: Online Poker Architecture

### Poker Client as Rootkit
- The poker client can potentially be used as a rootkit, allowing unauthorized access and control.

### Web Application Vulnerabilities
- Common web application vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), can be exploited.

### Authentication Vulnerabilities
- Weak authentication mechanisms can lead to account takeovers and unauthorized access.

### Attacking Supporting Infrastructure
- Attacks on supporting infrastructure, such as DNS servers and databases, can disrupt services and compromise data.

## River: Defenses

### Application Defenses
- Implementing strong encryption, regular security audits, and robust authentication mechanisms.
- Using intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) and firewalls.

### User Defenses
- Educating users on best practices for password management and recognizing phishing attempts.
- Encouraging the use of two-factor authentication and secure connections.

### Next Steps in Research
- Further research into advanced AI and machine learning techniques to detect and prevent cheating.
- Continuous monitoring and updating of security measures to stay ahead of emerging threats.

## Conclusion
- The online poker industry faces significant security challenges, but with the right defenses and regulatory frameworks, it can become a safer and more trusted environment.

## Questions
- Open the floor for any questions or further discussion.
