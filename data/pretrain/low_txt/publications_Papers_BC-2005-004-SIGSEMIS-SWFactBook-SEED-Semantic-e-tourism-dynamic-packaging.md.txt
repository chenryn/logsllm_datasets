### SEED Report: Semantic Web Fact Book 2005

#### Project Overview
**Project Name:** SEED (SEmantic E-tourism Dynamic packaging)

**1. General Project Information**

**Objectives:**
The primary goal of the SEED project is to enable the travel industry to leverage the latest Internet technologies, including Web services, Web processes, and semantics. Specifically, we aim to implement a semantic architecture for dynamic packaging applications that integrates various tourism data systems to create customized travel packages.

**Background:**
According to Carl H. Marcussen from the Centre for Regional and Tourism Research in Denmark, the European online travel market has grown significantly, increasing from 2.5 billion Euros in 2000 to an expected 28.5 billion Euros by 2006. This rapid growth and the continuous adoption of innovative technology have led to significant changes in the travel industry, with "Dynamic Packaging" emerging as a key concept. Dynamic packaging allows the combination of different tourism products into a single package, offering advantages such as lower prices and streamlined booking processes.

**Main Deliverables:**
- Data Extraction System
- Data Model Mapping Application (Syntactic/Semantic)
- Ontology for e-tourism
- Dynamic Packaging System
- Application for defining business rules for e-tourism

**Scientific and Technical Coordinator:**

**4. Deliverables**

The architecture will be composed of components grouped into packages for individual use and installation:
- **Data Extractor**: Integrates different information sources and channels data, handling various data types and managing data sources.
- **Data Model Mapping**: Interactive tool for mapping XML data to OWL data, generating mapping rules for future editing.
- **Ontology for e-tourism**: Defines concepts in the e-tourism domain, used for integrating different information sources and defining packaging rules.
- **Semantic Rules**: Engine for validating and managing rules based on a specific ontology.
- **Dynamic Package Application**: System for creating dynamic packages using integrated data sources, ontology, and defined rules.

**5. Workshops and Sponsored Events**

- **IWDDS 2006**: International Workshop on Dynamic Distributed Systems, July 4-7, 2006, Lisbon, Portugal.
- **SDWP 2006**: 3rd International Conference on Semantic and Dynamic Web Processes, September 18-22, 2006, Chicago, USA.

**6. Open Tools for Public Use**

At the end of the project, the following tools and modules will be available:
- **Data Extractor**: Extracts and integrates information from different data sources using XML Schemas and OWL.
- **Data Model Mapping**: Maps XML data to OWL data, generating transformation rules.
- **Ontology for e-tourism**: Defines e-tourism concepts and shared data model.
- **Semantic Rules**: Tool for defining and managing semantic rules.
- **Dynamic Package Application**: Creates dynamic packages using integrated data and defined rules.
