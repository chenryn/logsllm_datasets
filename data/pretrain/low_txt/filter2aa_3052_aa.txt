### Motivation and Overview of the Problem

#### Black Box Decision Making
- **Increasing Use of Software:** Software is increasingly being used to make critical decisions in various aspects of life, including hiring, housing, social interactions, navigation, news consumption, and more.
- **Importance of Transparency:** The more significant the decision, the more crucial it is that we understand and can question the inputs and processes involved.
- **Key Questions:**
  - What input data is used to make the decision? Is it accurate? Are there other relevant factors that should be considered?
  - Are protected attributes like race and gender used directly or indirectly through proxies?

#### Criminal Justice System
- **Growing Reliance on Algorithms:** The criminal justice system is increasingly using software and algorithms for decision-making.
- **Lack of Transparency:** These systems are often treated as black boxes, with trade secret protection prioritized over the rights of defendants and citizens to understand the decisions.
- **Evidence of Problems:** There are documented cases where the lack of transparency has led to unjust outcomes.

#### Can You Imagine...
- **Prison Sentencing Based on Proprietary Software:** Being sent to prison instead of receiving probation because a proprietary algorithm predicts you are likely to reoffend, but you cannot question how the decision was made. (Example: Eric Loomis)
- **Conflicting DNA Evidence:** Having the primary evidence against you be the results of DNA software, where one program indicates guilt and another innocence. (Example: Nick Hillary)
- **False Accusations Due to Contamination:** Being accused of murder based on DNA transferred by paramedics, with the issue only discovered months later. (Example: Lukis Anderson)

- **Need for Iterative Debugging and Improvement:**
  - **Technological Glitches:** Anyone who uses technology knows that glitches, bugs, and unintended consequences are common.
  - **Developer Perspective:** Those who build technology understand the ease with which substantial bugs can go undetected.
  - **Advantages of Independent Testing:** Independent, third-party testing is essential for identifying and fixing these issues.
  - **Risk of Bias:** If only those with a vested interest in the success of the software have access to the details, it creates a significant risk of injustice.

### Predictive Policing, Flawed Data, and Flawed Results

- **Garbage In, Garbage Out:** Poor quality input data leads to poor quality output.
- **Racial Disparities:** Predictive policing often perpetuates racial disparities.
- **Sources of Data:** The origins and reliability of the data used are often questionable.
- **Presumption of Guilt by Association:** Individuals may be presumed guilty based on their associations.
- **Constitutional Rights:** The use of such technologies raises concerns about the constitutional rights of individuals.
- **Lack of Transparency and Public Debate:**
  - Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)
  - Proprietary Trade Secrets
  - Sensitive Data

### Cell-Site Simulators (aka Stingray Devices)

- **Functionality:** Mimics a cell phone tower, compelling nearby phones to connect to it instead of a legitimate tower.
- **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs):** Often used without public knowledge or consent.
- **Examples:**
  - NYPD used cell-site simulators over 1,000 times from 2008 to 2015 without obtaining warrants.
  - **U.S. v. Lambis, 197 F. Supp. 3d 606 (S.D.N.Y. 2016)**
  - **People v. Gordon, 58 Misc. 3d 544 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2017)**
  - **Carpenter v. United States, 16-402, 2018 WL 3073916 (2018)**

- **People v. Gordon:**
  - **The Concession:** The court ruled that a probable-cause warrant is needed for cell-tracking.
  - **Post-Decision Denial:** Despite the ruling, the NYPD continued to deny the need for warrants.

- **Quote from 1984 by George Orwell:**
  - “He thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear. They could spy upon you night and day, but if you kept your head you could still outwit them. With all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking.”

### Mobile Digital Forensics and the Encryption War

- **Riley v. California, 134 S. Ct. 2473 (2014):** Established that police must obtain a warrant to search a cell phone.
- **Cellebrite UFED Touch2:**
  - Cellebrite is a digital forensics company specializing in mobile devices.
  - UFED = Universal Forensic Extraction Device.
- **Magnet Axiom and Paraben E3:** Other tools used for mobile digital forensics.
- **Extraction of Data:** The process involves extracting personal data from mobile devices.
- **Availability Outside of Law Enforcement:** These tools are also available to non-law enforcement entities.

- **Cellebrite Advanced Services (CAS) and GrayKey:**
  - **Cellebrite Advanced Services (CAS):**
    - Secret process performed by Cellebrite at their labs.
    - Cost: $1,500 per phone or a $250,000 annual subscription.

    - Secret tool sold only to law enforcement.
    - Models available for $15,000 or $30,000 per device.
  - **Defense Challenges:** Defense teams have no access to these tools, limiting their ability to verify and challenge their use.

### Facial Recognition

- **Key Considerations:**
  - What company provides the technology?
  - What algorithm is used?
  - What qualifies as a match?
  - Procedures, rules, and guidelines.
  - Source of images.
- **Report:**
  - **"The Perpetual Line-Up: Unregulated Police Face Recognition in America (2016)"** by Georgetown Law Center on Privacy & Technology (Clare Garvie, Alvaro Bedoya, & Jonathan Frankle).

### Case Study: Forensic Statistical Tool (FST)

- **Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), NYC:**
  - **Probabilistic Genotyping Software:**
    - Analyzes mixtures of DNA from 2-3 people.
    - Accounts for dropout (missing data) and drop-in (artifactual data).
    - Reports a "likelihood ratio" statistic as a measure of evidence.
  - **Development:**
    - Developed in-house using C# and MS SQL back-end.
    - Browser interface for casework.
    - Commercial sales to other labs were unsuccessful.

- **Approval and Implementation:**
  - **December 2010:** NY State Commission on Forensic Science approves FST for use in casework, evaluating 15 genetic locations for mixtures of up to 3 people.
  - **April 2011:** FST goes online for casework.
  - **April 2011:** FST is taken offline due to an inadvertent change made during an update.
  - **June 2011:** Modifications made, and some likelihood ratios were slightly modified as expected.

- **Quality Control Test:** Post-modification, the values were slightly modified as expected, but the modification did not affect the overall functionality.
