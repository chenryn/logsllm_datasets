## Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a new variant of the digital signature scheme called restricted message signing. This scheme restricts a signer to sign any message except for those in a specific message set. We anticipate that this primitive will be useful for various cryptographic applications. We propose the first construction of restricted message signing and prove its security in the random oracle model.

## 1. Introduction

In 1984, Shamir [S84] proposed the first idea of identity-based cryptography and presented an identity-based digital signature scheme. In 2001, Boneh and Franklin [BF01] revived interest in identity-based cryptography and introduced the first practical identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme in the random oracle model. In 2004, Boneh and Boyen [BB04] presented the first efficient and secure IBE scheme in the standard model, achieving slightly weakened CCA security, known as selective-ID security. Inspired by the techniques used in IBE schemes, we present a new variant of digital signatures: restricted message signing. This scheme restricts a signer such that they can sign any message except for those in a specific message set, which is not possible in standard digital signature schemes. This introduces a new concept to digital signatures and we expect it to be a valuable primitive for various cryptographic applications.

### Overview

Our scheme involves three players: a key distribution authority (KDA), a restricted signer, and a verifier. We assume that the KDA is a trusted third party. During the setup phase, the KDA generates some parameters, a restricted signing key for the signer, and the corresponding verification key. The KDA provides the parameters and a certificate to the signer along with the restricted signing key. The KDA also publishes the verification key. In the signing phase, the signer generates a sub-signature using the restricted signing key and constructs the full signature by combining the sub-signature, the parameters, and the certificate provided by the KDA. In the verification phase, the verifier checks the certificate for the parameters and the sub-signature. The verifier accepts the signature if both are valid; otherwise, it rejects the signature.

### Privacy and Unforgeability

A simple way to implement restricted message signing from a standard digital signature is for the KDA to issue the restricted messages as public information. Since the verifier knows the restricted messages, they can reject all signatures for these messages. However, the restricted signing key may be assigned based on the signer's qualifications, which may depend on highly sensitive information such as financial status, physical characteristics, or internal regulations. In such cases, it is natural for the signer to keep this information secret. Therefore, the public information issued by the KDA should not reveal which messages are restricted. Consequently, we stipulate not only unforgeability for signatures but also privacy for the restricted message set as a security requirement. Constructing a restricted message signing scheme that preserves privacy requires a sophisticated approach. The key technique is inspired by the method used in [BB04], where they constructed an IBE scheme and proved its security by reduction to the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) assumption.

In this paper, we define restricted message signing and two security requirements: unforgeability and privacy. We then propose the first construction of restricted message signing that operates on bilinear map groups. We show that our scheme is unforgeable against chosen message attacks if the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption holds and retains privacy in an information-theoretic sense.
