### 4.2 Security Analysis

We conclude that from now on, we can reject any attempt in which the key-exchange adversary sends a new ciphertext to an honest client that has not been created by an honest server. The adversary can thus only relay the second messages between an honest client and an honest server. In such an execution, we can again inject the GapDH challenge \(X, Y\) into the client’s ephemeral public key and the server’s temporary public key. This time, however, we need to guess one session and the correct temporary key used by the server, instead of one session and the correct long-term secret of a user, resulting in a factor of \(n_s \cdot n_t\) instead of \(n_s \cdot n_u\). Note that Corrupt queries for the server only disclose the long-term secret, but not the temporary key, by convention. Hence, we can carry out the same reduction to the GapDH problem as above.

The final step, similar to the stage-1 case, is to argue that there cannot be another session with identifier \(sid' = (info'_1, C') \neq sid_2 = (info_1, C)\) such that the inputs to the derivation function KDFexp are identical. Recall that each \(info_1\) contains the client’s ephemeral public key, which uniquely corresponds to some \(info_2\). Hence, a difference in \(info'_2 \neq info_2\) would result in different inputs to KDFexp. If, on the other hand, \(info'_1 = info_1\), then the two ciphertexts must differ. Due to the strike registers on the server’s side, the ciphertexts can only differ if one has been created by the adversary using the same stage-1 key. In this case, however, we would have rightfully rejected the ciphertext, ensuring that the client does not derive the session key \(K_2\). It follows that only the partnered sessions can have the same input \(DH(epk_C, tpk_S)\) and \(info_2\) to KDFexp, implying that the key in the test session is independent of all other keys (except for the keys of partnered sessions).

### 4.3 QUICi — A Key-Independent Version

Recall that our composition theorem (in the unilateral version) only applies to key-independent schemes, and QUIC, as it stands, does not satisfy this property. However, it is quite easy to modify QUIC into a key-independent version. With the modification to QUICi, we can then argue the security of, say, the composition of QUICi with a secure channel protocol for the second stage.

In the key-independent case, the adversary is allowed to Reveal the session key of a stage before the session key of the next stage has been established. The idea for QUIC is similar to TLS, where the resumption key is derived from the established master secret (from which the previous session keys have been computed). For QUICi, one would simply derive two secret values \(K_1\) and \(preK_2\) in the KDFexp step of the key derivation in the first stage, where \(K_1\) is still the first stage’s session key and \(preK_2\) is kept secret and subsequently input to the key derivation in the second stage. Any Reveal query would then disclose the session keys, but not \(preK_2\). It should thus be hard to compute the second-stage session keys given only the previous session keys. We stress that this change does not impose additional expensive state to be kept by the server: As apparent from Figure 3, the server computes \(K_2\) immediately after deriving \(K_1\) and must anyway keep a small state between the two KDF invocations.

### 4.4 A Note on 0-RTT Security

We highlight a specific security aspect of QUIC’s approach to establishing secure connections in 0-RTT, which, by its nature, is not coverable in our model. Remember that, for a 0-RTT connection establishment to be achievable, the client must speculate that the server still uses a previously known public key. If this is not the case, the server will reply with an updated server configuration (and key), allowing the client to retry the connection establishment. However, to benefit from the 0-RTT key exchange, the QUIC specification states that the client “must start sending before waiting for the server’s reply” [LC13] and rekeying with \(K_2\) takes place. In such a scenario, it must be assumed that some data will be sent under a (non-forward-secret) key \(K_1\) computed using the outdated server public key.

So far, this is not surprising, and as our model treats non–forward secrecy including corruptions, it accurately indicates that no security guarantees can be given for the data encrypted under that \(K_1\) if the adversary learns the outdated server public key (i.e., corrupts this server identity). What we cannot model in a precise cryptographic sense is the following attack: Assume that an active adversary learns a server’s static secret key, and this security breach is discovered, leading the server to generate a new configuration and key pair. In the scenario depicted above, the client aiming to talk to the server (referring to the server as a real instance, not as the identity behind a public key) will use the outdated public key for connection establishment. Therefore, an active adversary will be able to impersonate the server (in the real-world sense) using the corrupted static key, which the client believes still belongs to this server.

We stress that the fact that our model cannot represent this attack, although it constitutes a potential vulnerability, is not a weakness of our model, but rather reflects a mismatch between the real-world entity a client aims to communicate with and the outdated cryptographic identity employed for this purpose. This attack can be mitigated by employing strong binding between real-world and cryptographic identities using, e.g., timely certificate revocation. However, such means would naturally influence the low-latency timing properties QUIC specifically aims for with 0-RTT connections. At this point, we leave it open to discussion whether or not the outlined potential vulnerability is a fair price to pay to achieve this goal.

### 5 Conclusion

Our work introduces a model to reason about the security of multi-stage key exchange protocols. This notion enables us to assess Google’s new QUIC protocol and confirm its intended security properties as a key exchange protocol. This, in itself, is already a useful result to support the faith in the cryptographic strength of QUIC. We continue to argue about compositional security of multi-stage protocols in general, pointing out the importance of the new notion of (session-)key independence and how this could be easily integrated into QUIC.

Clearly, one of the next steps would be to analyze SSL/TLS with resumption as a multi-stage protocol. This, however, would require adapting the model first, because, as discussed earlier, SSL/TLS cannot even be shown to be secure as a single-stage protocol in the Bellare–Rogaway sense. Another interesting aspect would be to weaken the requirements for our compositional theorem or to prove that the requirements are indeed necessary.
