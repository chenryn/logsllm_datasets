### 5. Key Terms
- **IPC (Inter-Process Communication):**
  - An operating system mechanism that allows processes and applications to manage shared data and communicate.
  - Processes are categorized as clients and servers, where the client requests data and the server responds.
  - Many applications can be both clients and servers, especially in distributed computing.
- **Windows Named Pipes:**
  - A method for IPC in Microsoft Windows.
  - One-way or duplex communication between the pipe server and one or more pipe clients.
  - Utilizes the NPFS (Named Pipe Filesystem).
  - Any process can access named pipes, subject to security checks.
  - All instances of a named pipe share the same name but have their own buffers and handles.
  - Configurations include Half Duplex, Full Duplex, Byte-Oriented, Packet-Oriented, Local, and Network.
  - Network communication is not encrypted and uses SMB (port 445) or DCE/RPC (port 135).
- **RPC (Remote Procedure Call):**
  - A protocol allowing one program to invoke a service from another program on a different computer.
  - Uses port 135 TCP or UDP.
- **DCE/RPC (Distributed Computing Environment / Remote Procedure Calls):**
  - A facility for calling a procedure on a remote machine as if it were a local call.
- **SMB (Server Message Block):**
  - An application-layer network protocol providing shared access to files, printers, and serial ports.
  - Used for file sharing and authenticated inter-process communication.
  - Uses port 445 TCP.
- **Named and Unnamed/Anonymous Pipes:**
  - **Named Pipes:** Have a specific name, shared by all instances.
  - **Unnamed/Anonymous Pipes:** Not given a name, used only for communication between a child and parent process, always local, and vanish when closed.

### 6. Connecting to a Named Pipe
- **Location:**
  - All pipes are placed in the root directory of NPFS.
  - Mounted under the special path: `\\.\pipe\{pipe name}`.
  - Example: `\\.\pipe\foo` for a pipe named "foo".
  - Remote connection: `\\10.0.0.1\pipe\foo`.
- **Tools:**
  - **IO Ninja:** A versatile tool for named pipes and other communications.
  - **Wireshark:** For monitoring SMB communication.

### 7. Pipe ACLs and Connection Limitation
- **Implementation:**
  - Named pipes are implemented by the filesystem driver `npfs.sys` in Windows NT, which supports security descriptors.
  - By default, DACL permissions are set to allow everyone using anonymous login (null sessions).
  - ACLs can be modified to allow only specific users.
- **Tools:**
  - **Beyond Security Pipe Security Editor:** For enumerating named pipes ACLs.
  - **Win32 Pipe Security Editor:** Deprecated utility for Windows NT/2000/XP.

### 8. Named Pipes in the Wild
- **Case Study: Conficker Worm**
  - First detected in November 2008, targeting Microsoft Windows.
  - Uses OS flaws and dictionary attacks on admin passwords to propagate.
  - Difficult to counter due to advanced malware techniques.
  - Infected millions of computers in over 190 countries.
  - Variant C creates a named pipe for pushing URLs to other infected hosts, used for C&C purposes.
  - Other Trojans like Moker, ZxShell, and Petya also use named pipes.

### 9. Enumerating and Scanning for Named Pipes
- **Tools:**
  - **Sysinternals’ PipeList:** For detecting locally opened named pipes.
  - **SysInternals’ PipeAcl:** For viewing permissions of named pipes.
  - **Metasploit Module (Pipe_Auditor):** For remotely enumerating accessible named pipes over SMB and RPC.

### 10. Sniffing Named Pipes Content
- **Tool:**
  - **IO Ninja:** Enables sniffing and monitoring traffic of a chosen named pipe.

### 11. Fuzzing Named Pipes
- **Fuzzing:**
  - An automated software testing technique involving invalid, unexpected, or random data inputs.
  - Monitors for exceptions such as crashes and potential RCEs.
  - Types of fuzzing:
    - **Dumb (Black Box):** Goes over all possible inputs without understanding the expected ones.
    - **Smart (White Box):** Understands expected input and fuzzes along the edges.
- **Tools:**
  - **Windows IPC Fuzzing Tools:** For dump-fuzzing named pipes.

### 12. Exploitation and Impact
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - Software working with hidden or undocumented APIs.
  - Named pipes can contain vulnerabilities due to their forgotten nature.
  - Potential for Buffer Overflows leading to Denial of Service (DoS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE).
  - If ACLs allow remote access, remote DoS or RCE can be triggered.
  - Can be used to spread malware, as seen in the WannaCry ransomware campaign.

### 13. Case Study: Viber, qBittorrent, SugarSync
- **Viber:**
  - Cellular and endpoint social communication app.
  - Free calls, text, and picture sharing.
  - Competitor of WhatsApp, with 800 million users worldwide.
- **qBittorrent:**
  - Cross-platform BitTorrent client.
  - Free and open-source, written in C++.
- **SugarSync:**
  - Cloud service for file synchronization across devices.
  - Supports various operating systems, including Android, iOS, Mac OS X, and Windows.

### 14. Exploitation and Impact
- **QT Framework:**
  - Cross-platform application development framework.
  - Applications use the `qtsingleapp` functionality for writing temp files.
  - Fuzzing the named pipe led to remote crashes and potential command injection in qBittorrent.

### 15. Demo

### 16. Mitigation and Defense
- **Developers:**
  - Set secured ACLs to allow only authorized connections.
  - Follow the least privilege approach.
  - Limit the maximum number of instances of a named pipe.
- **Users/3rd Party Software Clients:**
  - Block unnecessary SMB and RPC services (ports 135 and 445), especially over WAN/Internet.
  - Segment the network according to security best practices.
  - Install the latest software security patches.
- **Hackers:**
  - Explore remotely accessible named pipes and test for RCE and DoS.
  - Have fun!

### 17. Closing Remarks
- **Windows Named Pipes:**
  - A forgotten, remotely accessible, socket-like interface.
  - A newly rediscovered potential world of local and remote vulnerabilities.
  - Don’t ignore named pipes in Windows desktop applications.
- **Stay Safe!**
