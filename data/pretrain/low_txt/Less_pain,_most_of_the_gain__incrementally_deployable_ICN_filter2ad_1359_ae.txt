### 1. Introduction to idICN

At first glance, the adoption of idICN may seem challenging. However, compared to clean-slate ICN designs that require overhauling every router, application, and networking stack, the changes mandated by idICN are minimal and can be implemented incrementally.

### 2. Feasibility and Ease of Use

To demonstrate the feasibility and ease of use of idICN, we have developed a prototype for a reverse proxy that generates Metalink metadata and signatures. This prototype is based on the Metalink plugin of the Apache Traffic Server. We have emulated support for several websites to show how idICN operates with legacy clients. For more information, please visit [http://www.idicn.org/](http://www.idicn.org/).

### 3. Discussion

#### 3.1 Workload Evolution

Internet workloads are constantly evolving. For example, trends such as social networks, user-generated content, and smartphones are creating more "long-tailed" content [48]. Even in the worst-case scenario, where we approximate these trends using a combination of low α and high spatial skew (as discussed in Section 5), the marginal benefits of pure ICN architectures appear to be limited. While we cannot predict the future evolution of these trends, this underscores the importance of our work and similar efforts to avoid overfitting the network infrastructure to specific workloads [19, 22].

#### 3.2 Economic and Policy Aspects of idICN

As noted elsewhere [18], there are valid economic (e.g., analytics for providers), legal (e.g., serving content with access restrictions), and privacy concerns (e.g., caches know what you are requesting) surrounding ICN. It is likely that idICN inherits some of these difficulties, and we do not yet have comprehensive solutions. However, by limiting the degree of caching and making it easier to attribute where a request was served from, idICN might simplify addressing some of these concerns. For instance, we can precisely track which caching proxy the resolver redirected a client to, enabling necessary accounting and reporting. These are open and valid concerns for both ICN and idICN that need to be addressed in future work.

#### 3.3 Deployment of Caches

Providers need incentives to deploy caches in idICN (and ICN). A natural question is where in the network they should choose to do so. Operating a cache involves both fixed upfront costs and several operational costs (e.g., rack space, bandwidth, power, and cooling). Based on informal and anecdotal evidence from CDN operators, a rough rule of thumb is that the lifetime of caching hardware is roughly 3–5 years, and this cache should serve enough traffic to be profitable. We speculate that idICN deployment will be driven by such economic considerations.

#### 3.4 What idICN Does Not Provide

We acknowledge that a clean-slate ICN architecture may provide other benefits (e.g., broadcast support or unifying caching and error recovery) that fall outside the scope of idICN. Our focus in this paper is on the most prominently perceived benefits of ICN.

For instance, idICN does not address two less well-understood benefits of ICN: protection against denial of service (DoS) and congestion control. ICN eliminates some simple DoS attacks due to IP spoofing [16]; the biggest benefit comes from caching to defend against request floods. We do not believe there is anything fundamentally different here; the benefit is simply amplifying the effective number of servers, similar to commercial services that offer DoS protection today [12]. An architecture based on edge caching, such as idICN, provides approximately the same hit-ratios as a pervasively deployed ICN, indicating that such an edge cache deployment can provide much of the same request flood protection as pervasively deployed ICNs. There is also some perception that the hop-by-hop flow control of some ICN proposals (maintaining flow balance) substantially reduces the dependence on end-to-end congestion control [23]. idICN retains standard congestion control but with separate congestion management on individual segments: proxy-to-proxy and proxy-to-host.

### 4. Related Work

The ICN-related work is vast, including at least three ACM SIGCOMM ICN workshops, two Dagstuhl gatherings, an ICNRG research group, and numerous journal special editions. Due to space constraints, we focus on the most relevant research projects and papers.

- **DONA** consistently uses nearest-replica routing, while **CCN/NDN** uses a hybrid of nearest replica (in LANs) and shortest path to origin (in WANs). Qualitative features, such as intrinsic binding and naming, can be made to use end-to-end support as we suggested. For example, NDN supports both human-readable names and self-certifying names, which could be used similarly to our idICN design.
  
- **PSIRP** and its successor **PURSUIT** [15] take a different approach based on the publish-subscribe paradigm. Many core contributions, such as zFilters [26], will be useful in network architecture designs. The rendezvous back-end of the project would require major pervasive changes to the architecture but can be deployed incrementally. The name resolution service can be implemented without pervasive caching or replacement of the existing switching infrastructure on the Internet.
  
- **NetInf** from the 4WARD project [2] is based on a name lookup resolution mechanism using a DHT implementation. We believe the suggested clean-slate design could be adapted to be deployed without pervasive caching. Their support for an information abstraction model, which allows multiple different representations of the same object, is highly useful and can be used in an end-to-end fashion with architectures like our idICN.
  
- **Serval** [32] focuses on supporting a service-centric network and does not require a pervasive caching infrastructure. Serval shares many features with our idICN design, including self-certifying names and much functionality placed on end hosts. Serval provides details, such as API design, about how ICNs or service-centric networks could be integrated into the stack of modern computers.

We are not the first to raise questions about the value and viability of ICN architectures. These include concerns regarding the scalability of ICN-capable routers [34], the privacy implications of ICN [3], legal (e.g., access restrictions and copyright concerns [1]) and economic considerations (at an Internet scale deployment [34]), and the performance benefits that ICN can provide [18]. Our contribution here is twofold: First, we provide a quantitative basis to analyze the performance benefits of universal caching and nearest-replica routing. Second, we present a reference design for an incrementally deployable ICN architecture that retains most of the advantages of previously proposed ICNs.

### 5. Conclusions

Our work can be viewed as an application of the end-to-end argument—we should impose significant changes to the network only if doing so will offer substantial performance improvements [38]. We apply this principle to many of the perceived benefits of ICN architectures. We find that the components of ICN that might need drastic changes to the network, as envisioned by some ICN proposals (pervasive caches and nearest-replica routing), do not appear to be fundamentally necessary. Furthermore, the other components of ICN can be implemented in a backwards-compatible fashion using techniques that already exist today. Building on these insights, we presented a roadmap for an incrementally deployable architecture that can achieve the benefits of ICN without a forklift upgrade to existing networks.
