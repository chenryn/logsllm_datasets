### Ethical Considerations

Although our research does not involve human subjects, it still requires ethical considerations due to the potential implications for information security, privacy, and safety in industrial systems. 

**Ethical Research Guidelines:**
- Throughout the design, execution, and analysis of our research, we adhere to basic ethical research guidelines [14] and institutional practices.
- We handle all collected data with care (see Appendix A.1) and follow standard measurement guidelines [16] to minimize the impact of our measurements (see Appendix A.2).

#### A.1 Responsible Handling of Data

**Data Collection:**
- We only request publicly available data from OPC UA servers, ensuring that no authorization is required.
- We do not bypass any security mechanisms or alter the state of a server; we do not write to any variable in an OPC UA server’s address space or execute any functions.

**Sensitive Data:**
- Despite our precautions, some datasets may contain sensitive data if servers lack proper access control.
- To protect this data, we store it on secured systems and exclude collected payload data from our dataset release. This means our results on address space access control in Section 5.4 cannot be independently reproduced.
- To prevent attackers from using our dataset to find insecure OPC UA deployments, we replace IP addresses and autonomous system IDs with consecutive numbers and redact fields in certificates containing equivalent address information (e.g., FQDNs).

**Identifying Operators:**
- We use the collected data to classify systems and analyze access control (Section 5.4).
- We automatically search the address space for nodes containing email addresses and manually identify operators of additional systems where contact data is not available.

**Operator Feedback:**
- Out of 493 systems with unprotected access, we retrieved contact information for 50 systems, including those for water sewerage, parking lot management, and hotel management.
- We contacted these operators via email (and one by phone) to inform them about potential security issues and provided guidance on securing their systems.
- We received two replies: one promising to forward the information to the IT department and another requesting security advice. As of four months after initial contact, most systems remain online, but one has implemented access control.

**Manufacturer Feedback:**
- We reached out to a manufacturer listed in the subject field of a security certificate used identically on more than 350 hosts and two additional certificates used on fewer hosts (Section 5.3).
- The manufacturer attributed the issue to customers/distributors copying system images and/or configuration files. They informed their customers about the risks in June 2020, but we observed no decline in the use of these certificates. Instead, there was an increase of 24 devices since their first reply and 3 devices in the week between our latest measurements.

#### A.2 Reducing Impact of Measurements

**Measurement Practices:**
- While related work suggests that zmap measurements do not necessarily impact industrial devices [8], we take steps to minimize the impact of our weekly OPC UA active Internet measurements.
- We coordinate with RWTH Aachen University’s Network Operation Center to reduce the impact on our Internet uplink and handle potential inquiries or abuse requests promptly. We also exclude systems that request exclusion.

**Contact Information:**
- We provide rDNS records for the IP address used for scanning and include contact information in the certificate and the ApplicationName field of our client.
- We maintain a website at the IP address used for scanning, providing detailed explanations of our research scope and purpose, along with opt-out instructions. Based on such requests, we exclude 5.79 million IP addresses (0.13% of the IPv4 address space) from our measurements.

**Measurement Load:**
- To avoid overloading any autonomous system, we spread our scans over approximately 24 hours and use zmap’s address randomization.
- To prevent overloading resource-constrained industrial devices, we instruct our scanner module to wait 500 ms between subsequent requests to one server.
- We set a scanning time limit of 60 minutes and an outgoing traffic limit of 50 MB per host, disconnecting the scanner if these limits are exceeded. On average, our scanner was connected to an OPC UA server for 110 seconds (std: 461 s, min: 31 ms, max: 5393 s) and caused 352 kB of outgoing traffic (std: 2 MB, min: 28 B, max: 50 MB).

**Conclusion:**
- Given that OPC UA does not realize security by default, it is essential to understand whether modern OPC UA deployments utilize built-in security features.
- We have taken sensible measures to reduce the risks introduced by active Internet measurements of industrial appliances, aiming to positively influence the security of OPC UA deployments.

### Detailed Results

**B.1 Separating Deficits Into Classes**

In our research, we found that 92% of Internet-facing OPC UA deployments are affected by various configuration deficits, including disabling built-in communication security, using deprecated security primitives, disregarding secure policies, systematically reusing private key material, and/or disabling access control.

**B.1.1 Manufacturers:**
- Some configuration deficits are limited to a few manufacturers, e.g., certificate reuse mainly affects devices of one manufacturer (Section 5.3).
- We classified device manufacturers using the ApplicationURL field provided by the servers.
- Figure 8a shows the number of affected devices and their distribution over manufacturers. Some large fractions of devices from specific manufacturers are affected by the same configuration deficits, such as enabling anonymous access or only providing security mode and policy None.
- Current product manuals of one manufacturer state that connections relying on this security mode and policy are insecure but do not inform about possible consequences.

**B.1.2 Autonomous Systems:**
- Figure 8b details the distribution of devices connected to different autonomous systems.
- Many devices with too weak certificates and reusing certificates are connected via the same autonomous system, an ISP focused on connecting (I)IoT devices to the Internet.
- Except for two regional Internet service providers, the devices affected by security configuration deficits are distributed across the Internet.

**B.2 Discovered Access Control Configurations**

In Section 5.4, we showed that many OPC UA devices are accessible without any authentication (offering anonymous access) and detailed the frequency of different authentication types.

**Table 2:**
- 621 servers (55% of all discovered servers) rejected our access attempts either by rejecting the secure channel establishment (7.2%) or denying access based on the authentication method (48%).
- 493 servers (44%) allowed access to their address spaces without any authentication, even though many offered secure authentication types in parallel.
- Out of these 493 servers, 295 were classified as production systems and 42 as test systems (26% and 3.8% of all Internet-facing OPC UA deployments, respectively).

This detailed breakdown provides a comprehensive view of the security configurations and access control settings of Internet-facing OPC UA deployments.
