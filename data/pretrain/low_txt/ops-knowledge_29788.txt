Aptana Studio has been my primary Python IDE for several years, and I have had a great deal of success with it. However, recently, I've encountered an issue where the IDE no longer recognizes any of my previously created PyDev projects. This problem started after I installed a recent update to Aptana Studio.

To troubleshoot, I uninstalled and reinstalled the latest version of Aptana from the official website, but the issue persisted. I also updated Java, suspecting a possible version incompatibility, but that did not resolve the problem either. 

Interestingly, the latest version of Eclipse works fine, and Aptana seems to function correctly for all other features except for PyDev (Python). I am currently running the latest version of Windows 8.

Has anyone else experienced this issue and found a solution? PyDev worked perfectly in Aptana Studio until the recent update. Any advice on how to fix or further troubleshoot this would be greatly appreciated.

**Additional Information:**

It appears that Aptana 3.5.0 and PyDev 3.0 are not fully compatible with Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks, as some users have reported issues with PyDev failing to recognize built-in symbols such as `None`. As a workaround, rolling back to Aptana 3.4.2 and a compatible version of PyDev might be a viable solution.
