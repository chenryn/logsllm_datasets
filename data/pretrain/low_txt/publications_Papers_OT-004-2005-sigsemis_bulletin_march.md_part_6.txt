### Call for Papers: IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering

**Special Issue: "Knowledge and Data Engineering in the Semantic Web Era"**

**Publication Date:** Early 2007

**Overview:**
IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering invites original manuscripts for a special issue on Semantic Web and Information Systems. The Semantic Web vision aims to transform the current Web of unstructured information into a knowledge-based framework that supports metadata and task delegation to software agents. Ontologies play a crucial role by providing shared semantics to metadata, enabling semantic interoperability. This special issue seeks to address the challenges and opportunities in data and knowledge engineering within this context.

**Scope:**
- Knowledge Engineering for organizational applications
- Semantic Web approaches to Information Systems
- Ontology-Based Information Systems research
- Database and Knowledge Representation aspects

**Topics Include:**
- Knowledge-based tools and techniques for or enabled by Semantic Web applications
- Semantic mapping in databases and knowledge representations
- Engineering of ontologies for Information Systems and their associated data management requirements
- Algorithms and representations for Semantic Web approaches to Knowledge management
- Knowledge integration through ontologies, semantic metadata, and databases of annotations
- Design and modeling of Semantic Web repositories and distributed knowledge-based systems
- Semantic Web and metadata query languages and implementation frameworks
- Management of semantic metadata

**Submission Guidelines:**
- Submitted articles must not have been previously published or currently submitted elsewhere.

### An Interview with Richard Watson, President of the Association for Information Systems

**Interviewer:** Miltiadis Lytras

**1. Leading a Discipline:**
- **Miltiadis:** What does it mean to lead a discipline? What are the critical issues?
- **President Watson:** Leading a discipline is more about facilitation than control. My role as President of AIS is to identify and address issues important to members in a participative and open manner.

**2. International Character of AIS:**
- **Miltiadis:** What are your key priorities for the international character of AIS?
- **President Watson:** Priorities are often set by circumstances. Recently, financial issues have been a focus, but my broader goals include improving scholarly productivity and expanding the global community of IS scholars.

**3. Financial Difficulties:**
- **Miltiadis:** How can AIS members help with financial difficulties?
- **President Watson:** Members can help by understanding that some changes, such as modest social events, are necessary. They can also encourage libraries to subscribe to AIS journals and non-members to join AIS.

**4. Publication Opportunities:**
- **Miltiadis:** Are the publication opportunities in top IS journals sufficient?
- **President Watson:** We need more outlets for IS scholarship. I am working on a project to improve the academic publication system.

**5. Promoting AIS Contributions:**
- **Miltiadis:** How difficult is it for an international association to promote its contribution to society?
- **President Watson:** AIS fosters IS research through journals and conferences. Local chapters play a crucial role in establishing AIS as a voice for IS scholars in their respective countries.

**6. Top Challenges for MIS:**
- **Miltiadis:** What are the top challenges for the MIS field?
- **President Watson:** Our research should be more focused on wealth creation and cutting-edge problem-solving. I would like to see IS professors spinning off companies to market new solutions.

**7. New Information and Knowledge Infrastructure:**
- **Miltiadis:** What is your vision for a new information and knowledge infrastructure for AIS members?
- **President Watson:** I am still developing a paper to describe this vision.

**8. Synergies with the Business World:**
- **Miltiadis:** Should AIS further exploit synergies with the business world?
- **President Watson:** AIS needs to focus on core academic activities. With more resources, we could expand our roles, but we need to determine members’ priorities first.

**9. Context for IS Research:**
- **Miltiadis:** Do new approaches provide a new context for IS research?
- **President Watson:** IS research should tackle problems that matter to everyone, such as global climate change, environmental degradation, and poverty.

**10. PhD Programs:**
- **Miltiadis:** What skills and competencies are important for PhD programs in IS?
- **President Watson:** PhD programs are about learning to think. It takes time to master the necessary skills, and I believe the current length of PhD programs is appropriate.

**11. Gap Between Theory and Practice:**
- **Miltiadis:** Is there a gap between theoretical propositions and business practice?
- **President Watson:** Business is theory in practice. The gap lies in applying the right theory. Academics need to help practitioners close this gap.

**12. Cooperation with Other Associations:**
- **Miltiadis:** How do you evaluate the cooperation of AIS with other associations like IEEE, INFORMS, etc.?
- **President Watson:** My priorities are to develop more AIS chapters and ensure closer collaboration among them. We need to build out our community to embrace all IS scholars.

**13. Benefits of Globalization:**
- **Miltiadis:** How do you view the benefits of globalization?
- **President Watson:** Globalization has positive aspects, such as the power of markets to allocate resources. AIS offers free e-library access to scholars in non-rich countries and provides membership discounts.

**14. Shared Vision for the IS Community:**
- **Miltiadis:** What are the key actions towards a shared vision for the IS community?
- **President Watson:** A single vision might be dangerous. I encourage different chapters to develop distinctive identities and approaches to IS research.

**15. Knowledge Sharing Initiatives:**
- **Miltiadis:** Can AIS initiate similar movements?
- **President Watson:** Projects of this scale are beyond AIS’s resources, but we should ensure members are aware of these initiatives through panels and special issues.

**16. Expansion of the IS Community:**
- **Miltiadis:** Is supporting conferences and workshops a critical step?
- **President Watson:** Building the global IS community is important. AIS already supports e-learning through ISWorld, listservs, and the e-library. There are new opportunities for further development.

**17. Impactful Reading:**
- **Miltiadis:** Can you share a book or article that made a great impact on you?
- **President Watson:** Steven Pinker’s “The Blank Slate” has been very useful for understanding human information processing. I see a need to link IS with evolutionary biology.

**18. European vs. American IS Communities:**
- **Miltiadis:** Are there differences between these communities?
- **President Watson:** I hope there are differences, as monocultures are dangerous. My observations suggest that there is no imminent threat of a monoculture in Europe.

**19. Formation of the New Special Interest Group:**
- **Miltiadis:** Any thoughts on the formation of the New Special Interest Group on Semantic Web and Information Systems?
- **President Watson:** SIGs are key action and innovation centers in AIS. The new SIG exemplifies the energy and vitality of many SIGs, organizing new conferences, tracks, websites, and newsletters.
