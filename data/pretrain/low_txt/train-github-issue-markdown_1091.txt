## Description
In the latest version of the documentation for `task_reject_on_worker_lost`, it states: "Enabling this can cause message loops."

However, enabling this feature does not actually cause message loops. Tasks will only execute twice, and tasks that have been redelivered will not be redelivered again. This is confirmed by the source code.

## Suggestions
If this is a documentation error, the warning should be removed from the document. If the documentation is correct, the code needs to be modified. I am available to assist with either modifying the documentation or the code.
