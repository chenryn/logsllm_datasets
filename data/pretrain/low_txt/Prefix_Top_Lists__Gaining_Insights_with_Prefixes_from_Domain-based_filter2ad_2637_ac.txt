### 4. Name Server Analysis

In this section, we analyze the name server records collected by our DNS scanner, focusing on data from August 1, 2019. According to RFC 2182, each zone should have topologically distinct name server IP addresses to ensure resilience against routing issues [10]. This means that the IP addresses should be in at least two different normalized prefixes for each IP version (IPv4 and IPv6). We use the results of our DNS scanner to determine if the zones of the top list domains comply with this requirement.

#### 4.1 Compliance with RFC 2182

Figures 4 and 5 present the distribution of non-compliant zones, sorted according to their top list rank and the rank of the prefix they are in. The x-axis represents the share of ranks per top list, allowing for a comparable analysis across different top lists (see Table 3 for total numbers).

**Figure 4: Domain-Based Top List Results**

The relative graphs for all top lists and both IP versions show similar distributions. The distribution of non-compliant zones is nearly linear, indicating that compliance with the RFC requirement is independent of the top list rank. For the Top 1k zones, which represent less than 0.1% of all zones, we find that 2.3% of the Alexa Top 1k violate the RFC requirement. Similar results are observed for the Majestic and Umbrella top lists.

- **IPv4**: 12% of all IPv4 zones do not respect the RFC requirement.
- **IPv6**: Approximately 50% of all entries with IPv6 name servers do not comply with the RFC requirement.

Notably, even top-ranked domains like google.com and youtube.com violate the RFC requirement for IPv6. In contrast, the first offender for IPv4 is w3schools.com (rank 89), followed by onlinesbi.com (rank 95) and ettoday.net (rank 111).

**Figure 5: Prefix-Sorted Top List Results**

This figure shows the domains sorted by the rank of the highest-ranking normalized prefix. Compared to Figure 4, the IPv4 prefix-sorted domains provide a smaller share on the top ranks. While the domain top list ranked violations grow linearly from the start, the prefix-sorted ones start with a near-linear growth only after about 30%. A short and steep increase for Umbrella at about 35% is due to the domain parking service Bodis. We assess the DNS availability of parked domains as not critical, and these domains appear in the Alexa and Majestic lists but at lower ranks. This is because Umbrella reflects the Cisco OpenDNS query count, while the other lists use more complex metrics.

#### 4.2 Provider-Specific Observations

Even though Google hosts a small share of domains, the importance of these domains corresponds to a large Zipf weight. Cloudflare, on the other hand, hosts more than 300k zones of the Alexa list and uses a single /48 for their IPv6 name servers. United Internet, one of the top five providers, also uses a single /48 for their IPv6 name servers. These three providers are among the most important in our prefix top list, and their non-compliance indicates a general problem with the topological diversity of configured IPv6-enabled name servers.

### 5. Discussion and Limitations

In this section, we present the key results of our prefix top list approach and discuss implications, limitations, ethical considerations, and data publication.

#### 5.1 Stability and Global View

As described in Section 2, our prefix top list provides a local view. Fluctuations in domain-based top lists and DNS load balancing can influence the prefix top lists. To improve stability and global applicability, we propose distributed DNS measurements and repeated resolution of popular domains to cover a larger share of their prefixes.

#### 5.2 DNS-Based Load Balancing

To gauge the impact of geo-load balancing, we performed limited measurements using commercial virtual machines in Newark and Singapore. Analyzing the Alexa-based top list, we found that the additional vantage points could resolve only about 90% of domains compared to our local vantage point. Within the successfully resolved domains, 7% resolve to different IPv4 addresses on at least one vantage point. When aggregated to the normalized prefix level, only 5% of domains differ in their result.

#### 5.3 Localized BGP Dump

From the BGP dump, we extract the origin prefix and AS number. Comparing our BGP dump to archives of the Route Views project [18], we found that only about 1% of the Top 1k IPv4 BGP prefix top list entries change. These changes are substitutions of larger prefixes with smaller ones. In IPv6, this effect is more prevalent due to the larger address space, resulting in more specific prefix announcements.

#### 5.4 Web-Based Top Lists

To improve the prefix top list generation, we must consider the shortcomings of proprietary top lists. The Alexa and Majestic top lists provide a web-centered view, which may not represent the importance of generic Internet infrastructure. The Umbrella top list, generated from OpenDNS statistics, also provides a biased view. Future work will include measuring the impact of including www subdomains on the prefix top lists.

#### 5.5 DNS Resilience

As shown by Allman [4] and confirmed by our measurements, the resilience of the DNS ecosystem in terms of topologically distributed name servers warrants improvements. Especially for IPv6, half of all zones with IPv6 name server addresses have fewer than two distributed name server prefixes, contrary to best current practices [10]. This results in decreased resilience for clients with IPv6-only resolvers compared to their IPv4 peers.

#### 5.6 Ethical Considerations

For our active measurements, we follow the guidelines proposed by Allman and Paxson [5], Partridge and Allman [19], and Dittrich et al. [9]. By limiting our query rate and using conforming packets, we minimize the risk of causing problems on target systems. During our measurement period, we received no abuse emails or complaints.

#### 5.7 Data Publication

We provide our prefix top list for fellow researchers at https://prefixtoplists.net.in.tum.de/.

### 6. Related Work

#### 6.1 Top List Analysis

Scheitle et al. [21] published a thorough analysis of different domain-based top lists, finding low intersections between lists and daily domain churn of up to 50%. Le Pochat et al. [15] confirmed many of Scheitle et al.’s findings and provided an aggregated combination of other top lists over time. Our work applies a Zipf distribution to rank domains based on popularity and aggregates prefixes to create more representative and stable prefix top lists.

#### 6.2 DNS Analysis

Allman [4] analyzed DNS robustness over nine years, finding a downward trend of second-level domains with fewer than two name servers in distinct /24 prefixes. In 2018, he found that 11% of second-level domains violate RFC robustness requirements. Our data shows a similar 12% share of non-compliant domains in top lists, with top-ranked domains performing better.

### 7. Conclusion

Our prefix top lists provide a Zipf-weighted aggregation of popular and distributed services into a single metric. We demonstrated temporal stability and found less than 0.05 weight changes per day, improving on the Alexa top list. When analyzing name server resilience, we found that top domains are better configured. However, IPv6 resilience still lags behind its IPv4 counterpart.
