### 7.2 Tighter Privacy Analysis for the Dialing Protocol

In this section, we analyze the impact of using Gaussian and Laplace noise on the privacy guarantees of the dialing protocol. Specifically, we show that with Gaussian noise, the noise rate can be reduced by a factor of almost 5 while still meeting the privacy requirements. For the conversation protocol, the noise rate can be reduced by a factor of 10. With Laplace noise, the noise rate can be reduced by a factor of 2 for the dialing protocol and by a factor of 4 for the conversation protocol. These results are illustrated in Figures 20 and 21, which are provided in the appendix.

The conversation protocol generates more observations (i.e., more compositions) compared to the dialing protocol. As a result, the looseness of the bounds used in the original Vuvuzela paper is more pronounced for the conversation protocol due to the higher number of observations. Therefore, the tightness of our bounds is more significant for the conversation protocol.

For comparison, Figure 15 depicts the original graphs from the Vuvuzela analysis, showing the ε and δ values as functions of the noise rate \( r \) for the dialing protocol. We extend these figures with the lowest, magenta graphs (marked with a ∗), which represent the performance of our proposed Gaussian noise that uses nearly 5 times less noise and is computed using our bucketing approach. Our method computes not only one \((\varepsilon, \delta)\) pair for each number of observations \( r \) but an entire \(\varepsilon, \delta\) graph. We chose representative \(\varepsilon\) values that are close to (and even below) the \(\varepsilon\) values for the highest noise configuration LP(20k, 1130) from the original Vuvuzela paper.

Figure 15 shows that our bounds with the reduced noise and using Gaussian noise GS(4.1k, 8332) are below the previous bounds for the highest noise configuration LP(20k, 1130). This proves that a noise reduction of nearly a factor of 5 still allows the dialing protocol to achieve the privacy requirements of \( e^\varepsilon \leq 2 \) and \( \delta \leq 10^{-4} \).

All computations have been conducted with 100,000 buckets.

- **Solid Magenta Line (Gaussian noise, μ = 4.1k∗, σ = 320):** Computed with our technique.

Next, we illustrate that our method computes bounds that are several orders of magnitude better than Vuvuzela’s original bounds. For \( r = 8,192 \) observations, Figure 16b shows that using the highest noise configuration with Laplace noise LP(20k, 1130) results in a privacy bound that is almost 3 orders of magnitude lower in terms of \(\delta\), and with Gaussian noise GS(20k, 15982) more than 4 orders of magnitude. The figure depicts the \(\varepsilon, \delta\) graphs computed by our approach for the highest noise configuration LP(20k, 1130), for the corresponding Gaussian noise GS(20k, 15982), for the configuration that we propose GS(4.1k, 8332), and compares it against Vuvuzela’s previous bounds LP(20k, 1130). Additionally, we depict the respective lower bounds, which show that our bounds are quite tight, with little room for improvement.

Moreover, due to the more comprehensive view that a full \(\varepsilon, \delta\) graph provides, we can see that the highest noise configuration with Gaussian noise GS(20k, 15982) achieves the privacy requirements (\(\delta \leq 10^{-4}\)) for less than \( e^\varepsilon = 1.5 \) after 8,192 observations.

We would like to stress that the lower bounds show that our result is tight up to \(\delta \geq 10^{-4}\) for GS(4.1k, 8332), \(\delta \geq 10^{-6}\) for LP(20k, 1130), and GS(20k, 15982) for \(\delta \geq 10^{-8}\). This tightness is solely a scalability issue and ultimately depends on the number (and hence granularity) of the buckets. A more optimized implementation (e.g., based on GPUs) would be able to significantly increase the number of buckets, thus achieving even tighter upper and lower bounds.

For completeness, we also show in Figure 16a the \(\varepsilon, \delta\) graphs for the dialing protocol for low \( r \): \( r = 1024 \) and the recommended parameters \(\mu = 8k, \gamma = 500\). Here, we can see that our bound is 2 orders of magnitude lower than Vuvuzela’s previous bounds for the noise level. The figure also shows that reducing the noise by a factor of 5, i.e., GS(1.6k, 320), still achieves the privacy requirements (\( e^\varepsilon \leq 2 \) and \(\delta \leq 10^{-4} \)).

As a comparison, using Laplace noise only enables a noise reduction of a factor of 2, as shown in Figure 21 in the appendix. Interestingly, the reduced Laplace noise achieves the same privacy bounds as the reduced Gaussian noise if the Laplace noise has twice the variance as the Gaussian noise (i.e., \(\gamma = \sigma\)) but a 2.5 times wider range, as indicated in Section 6. This demonstrates the significant effect the steepness of the Gaussian noise can have in practice.

### 7.3 Tighter Privacy Analysis for the Conversation Protocol

Figure 18 depicts the \(\varepsilon\) and \(\delta\) graphs with increasing \( r \) for the conversation protocol. We compare Gaussian noise GS-new2 with the previous bounds for the recommended noise configurations. Despite adding significantly less noise, GS-new2 outperforms the bounds from the original analysis.

For \( r = 524,288 \) observations, Figure 19b shows that using LP-high results in bounds for \(\delta\) that are almost 4 orders of magnitude lower, and for the corresponding Gaussian noise GS-high more than 6 orders of magnitude lower compared to their original result. The figure also shows the corresponding lower bounds, indicating that our bounds are tight for reasonably small values of \(\varepsilon\). Furthermore, we can see that even GS-new1 meets the privacy requirements of \( e^\varepsilon \leq 2 \) and \(\delta \leq 10^{-4}\) for \( r = 524,288 \) observations.

For completeness, we also show in Figure 19a the \(\varepsilon, \delta\) graphs for the conversation protocol for \( r = 65,536 \). Here, we can also see the tightness of our bound for reasonably small \(\varepsilon\). We can see that GS-low is more than 7 orders of magnitude lower than Vuvuzela’s previous bounds for the same noise level. Moreover, we can see that even GS-new2 meets the privacy requirements of \( e^\varepsilon \leq 2 \) and \(\delta \leq 10^{-4}\) for \( r = 65,536 \) observations.

As a comparison, using Laplace noise only enables a noise reduction of a factor of 4, as shown in Figure 20.

### 8. Conclusion and Future Work

In this work, we presented privacy buckets, a sound numerical approach for computing upper and lower bounds for approximate differential privacy after \( r \)-fold composition. We demonstrated that our method can derive upper and lower bounds for differentially private mechanisms with worst-case distributions. Our method is applicable in various scenarios, including adaptive composition, evolving sequences of distributions, and static distributions. Our bounds have been proven to be sound and empirically shown to be tight.

We compared our approach to the Kairouz, Oh, and Viswanath (KOV) composition theorem, as well as to the moments accountant (MA) bounds and bounds derived via concentrated differential privacy (CDP). We found that the KOV theorem provides reasonably tight bounds for the Laplace mechanism but not for other distributions, such as the Gauss mechanism or for a pair of histograms of timing-leakage measurements from the CoverUp system. Our bounds significantly improve over MA bounds and CDP bounds, which is particularly relevant for smaller values of \( e^\varepsilon \). We also observed that the Gauss mechanism behaves much better under a high number of compositions than a Laplace mechanism with the same variance, and we found evidence that the \((\varepsilon, \delta)\)-graph of a Laplace mechanism converges to the \((\varepsilon, \delta)\)-graph of a Gauss mechanism with half the variance.

By improving the analysis of the anonymity network Vuvuzela, we show that tighter bounds can have a significant impact on actual protocols. Our analysis can help to devise better protocols, e.g., to exchange the Laplace noise with Gaussian noise, for which better results can be achieved.

We encourage the application of our privacy buckets to other ADP mechanisms, such as to the optimal ADP mechanisms [10, 15] (e.g., comparing their composition behavior to the Gauss mechanism), to measure the impact of our bounds on precision and recall of privacy-preserving ML methods by using less noise, and to improve more existing privacy analyses. We consider it interesting for future work to explore the relationship between the Gauss mechanism and the Laplace mechanism and to analyze the development of ADP under composition for other noise distributions.
