## Abstract
Since 2004, the DETER Cyber-security Project has been developing an evolving infrastructure—comprising facilities, tools, and processes—to serve as a national resource for cyber security experimentation. Leveraging insights into the requirements for cyber science and lessons learned over eight years of operation, we have made several transformative advances towards creating the next generation of DeterLab. These advancements in experiment design and research methodology are enhancing not only the scale, complexity, diversity, and repeatability of experiments but also the ability of researchers to build on the prior work of others in the DeterLab user community. This paper outlines these advancements, resulting in a new experimental science and a transformed facility for cyber-security research, development, and evaluation.

## 1. Introduction: The DETER Project
The DETER project aims to advance cyber security research practices by extending the methods, technology, and infrastructure required for the scientific development of cyber-defense technology [1], [2]. Our research results are implemented through the operation and evolution of DeterLab, transforming it from a basic hardware-focused network security testbed in the early phase, to a shared experiment and testing lab in the middle phase, and now towards a new kind of facility for cyber-security experimental science.

Our vision for the next iteration of DeterLab is to create a facility that functions as a scientific instrument, enabling researchers to generate knowledge and understanding through observation, modeling, and measurement of computer and cyber security threats and defenses. We are actively engaged in research and development to improve the scope and usability of this instrument throughout the lifecycle of an experiment—definition, execution, and interpretation. A fundamental goal is to support diverse research communities and enable users to contribute to and leverage a common body of tools and knowledge, thereby facilitating reproducible and repeatable experiments.

We believe that this evolution of DeterLab will shift the science of cyber security experimentation towards rigorous design, construction, execution, and interpretation of experiments. Such a shift is essential to advance the scale, pace, and power of cyber-security research and to expand the research community, accelerating the development of innovative, scientifically tested, and demonstrably effective new cyber-defenses required for personal digital security and national-scale critical infrastructure protection.

In pursuit of this goal, the DETER project's research program has been influenced by several lessons learned from our experiences in evolving DeterLab and supporting many researchers using it. These lessons have driven new areas of work on developing cyber-security science methods, techniques, and resources needed to provide DeterLab researchers with major advances in their scientific and experimental capabilities: repeatable, flexible, and variable experimentation, discovery, observation, and testing.

This paper provides:
- Background motivation and history for the DETER project
- A review of key advances in creating a science of experimentation and lessons learned
- A description of the current DETER research program and roadmap
- A prognosis for the use in DeterLab of the resulting innovations in cyber-security research practices and infrastructure, as we progress toward our vision of a new environment and community for science-based cyber security experimentation and testing.

## 2. Background: Motivation and History
The DETER project emerged from observations within the computer and network security research community, funding organizations, and security product companies:
- Security technology development was largely reactive.
- The pace of security technology development was slower than the evolution of existing threats and the emergence of new threats.
- Successfully and widely deployed security technologies (e.g., host boundary control) could be tested with common equipment at small scale.
- Emerging threats, such as worms and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, operate at Internet scale, requiring new classes of defense and evaluation strategies focused on scale and aggregate behavior.
- New security approaches (e.g., behavioral anomaly analysis) need large-scale and highly varied testing.
- Security innovators lacked the facilities to test new security technologies in environments with the scale and fidelity of real deployment environments, often constructing their own test environments with little or no leverage from the testing work of other innovators.

A consequence of these observations was that promising new security technologies, often developed by innovators with limited testing resources, fared poorly when tested by applied security practitioners in real deployment environments [3]. Technology transfer was problematic due to significantly lower effectiveness outside the innovator’s limited test facility. In many cases, commercial organizations did not find it cost-effective to increase effectiveness.

With this background in 2001-2002, one of the several factors of cyber-security deficiency seemed addressable: the lack of testing facilities with significantly greater resources and flexibility than the limited test environments of most innovators, and greater fidelity to real deployment environments. A DARPA-sponsored report [4] called for and stated requirements for a national cyber-defense technology test facility. One result of that report was the impetus for funders at NSF and DHS to define and fund the project that was the first phase of DETER.

The initial focus of DETER was to build a national testbed, enabling cyber security innovators to test new technology at larger scale, with more complex test fixtures, assembled to be more representative of real deployment environments. The first-phase DETER project (led by USC/ISI, UC Berkeley, and Sparta, Inc.) was funded by two NSF programs—Experimental Infrastructure Network (EIN) and Network Research Testbeds (NRT)—and by DHS. At the same time, EIN and NRT co-funded the EMIST project, composed of researchers from Penn State, McAfee Research, ICSI, Purdue, Sparta, Inc., SRI International, and UC Davis. EMIST researchers were to use the DETER testbed, help build knowledge about researchers' needs based on experience working in the testbed, and build experience with existing testing tools used in the testbed. Together, these efforts led to the success of the first phase of DETER, with the assembly of the network and physical resources, development of controls and user interfaces for experimenters, assessment and integration of existing tools, and the creation of a collaborative community of researchers.

The testbed became operational in March 2004. The first DETER Community Workshop was held in November 2004, with working groups of researchers who published refereed publications on work performed in the DETER testbed covering, e.g., DDoS defense [5], worm dynamics [6], worm defense [7], and detection of routing infrastructure attacks [8]. The ensuing years saw maturation of the testbed through use and expansion, and growth of the research community with a greatly increased breadth of activity. Both DETER researchers and community collaborators worked on research topics in the technology for supporting and enabling cyber-security research work: experiment automation, benchmarking, usage, malware containment, and our initial work on federation [9], now a central component of DeterLab technology.

In the second phase of DETER (2007-2009), the results of this "research on research"—our exploration of novel technologies and methodologies for cyber-security research—were put into practice in the testbed, which was also expanded in capacity. The result was the evolution from the DETER testbed to DeterLab, a shared virtual lab composed of the underlying testbed resources, technology for using and managing the resources as test fixtures, and a growing variety of tools and services for experiment support, including the full-support release of the federation capability and the first-generation experimenters’ workbench, SEER [10].

With the technological maturity achieved in this phase and the experience gained from supporting over 1,000 researcher team members, the stage was set for DETER project activities to focus increasingly on research and development in the areas of cyber-security experimentation methodology, tools, resource expansion, utilization innovations, and other new methods of using DeterLab for scientific experimentation.

The experience during this phase included several lessons learned that provided important guidance for the current DETER research program. The balance of this paper describes five significant lessons learned and outlines the current research program developed from the combination of our vision of an advanced scientific instrument and lessons learned from the developing community.

## 3. Lessons Learned: Challenges for Science-Based Experimentation
Here we describe several lessons learned from early experience with DETER. These lessons derive from observing norms of researcher activity that emerged in the second phase of DeterLab use. Those norms included some basic terms and a typical workflow.

Researchers working in DeterLab are called "users" or "experimenters." A team of users working together is called a "project." The focus of activity of a project is a construct called an "experiment"—a term that applies whether the construct is used in the strict sense as part of activity to prove or disprove a hypothesis, or the construct is used for broader purposes such as observing malware behavior, measuring the effect of counter-measures, or other forms of testing or observation that could contribute to the formation or demonstration of the effectiveness of a counter-measure.

The concept of an "experiment" is broad. In DeterLab's vernacular, the term "experiment" is used, at a minimum, to describe the experimental apparatus or environment that users have constructed from computing and network resources, hosts, software, test fixtures, measurement tools, and other components of a system that experimenters operate. Beyond this, "experiment" is also frequently used to describe the experimental procedures and experimenter activity to interact with an apparatus in operation and to review results of operation—that is, the entire "experimental protocol" for a particular research activity.
