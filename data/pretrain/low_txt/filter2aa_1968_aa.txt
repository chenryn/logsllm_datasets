**ORDER**

**I. Background**

Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. and Vivendi Games, Inc. (collectively, "Blizzard") are the creators and operators of a multiplayer online role-playing game known as World of Warcraft ("WoW"). WoW was released in November 2004. Players control characters within a virtual universe, exploring the landscape, fighting monsters, completing quests, building skills, and interacting with other players and computer-generated characters. As players progress, they acquire in-game assets, experience, and power. Players can advance from level 1 to level 60 with the basic game, and through level 70 with an expansion module.

Blizzard owns the copyright for the WoW software, which consists of two components: the "game client" software and the "game server" software. Users can obtain the game client software by purchasing a copy at a retail store or downloading it from the WoW website. To play WoW, users load the game client software on their personal computers and access the game server software through an online account for which they pay a monthly fee.

Use of WoW is governed by an End User License Agreement ("EULA") and Terms of Use Agreement ("TOU"). These agreements are displayed on a player's computer screen when the game client software is loaded and the player seeks online access to the game servers. Players must agree to the terms of the EULA and TOU before proceeding to play the game. The record contains several different versions of the EULA and TOU. The parties agreed at oral argument that the most recent versions—the February 2, 2007 EULA and the October 16, 2006 TOU—are the operative agreements for purposes of the summary judgment motions. Therefore, the Court will not address the earlier versions.

WoW has been enormously successful. Blizzard asserts, and MDY does not dispute, that WoW is the largest and most successful multiplayer online game in the world. WoW currently has approximately 10,000,000 active players and generates more than $1.5 billion in revenue annually.

**II. The Dispute**

Michael Donnelly is the founder of MDY Industries, LLC ("MDY"). Donnelly created, and MDY owns, a software program known as WowGlider ("Glider"). Glider is a computer program, often referred to as a "bot," which plays WoW for its owner while the owner is away from their computer. Glider enables the owner to advance more quickly within WoW than would otherwise be possible. MDY began selling Glider to WoW users in June 2005 and has sold approximately 100,000 copies to date.

Blizzard contends that Glider diminishes the value of WoW and causes Blizzard to lose customers and revenue. According to Blizzard, WoW is a carefully balanced competitive environment where players compete against each other and the game to advance through the game's various levels and to acquire game assets. Blizzard claims that Glider upsets this balance by enabling some players to advance more quickly and unfairly, diminishing the game experience for other players. Blizzard also contends that Glider enables its users to acquire an inordinate number of game assets—sometimes referred to as "mining" or "farming" the game—with some users even selling those assets for real money in online auction sites, an activity expressly prohibited by the TOU.

MDY, by contrast, claims that Glider enhances the game playing experience of its users and even enables some disabled users to play WoW. MDY contends that Glider users constitute a small fraction of WoW players and that the effect of Glider on WoW is minimal. MDY characterizes itself as an innovator and entrepreneur and claims that Blizzard seeks improperly to use the copyright laws to squelch competition and stifle innovation.

On the morning of October 25, 2006, representatives of Blizzard appeared at Donnelly's home and informed him that the sale and use of Glider violated Blizzard’s rights in WoW. The representatives stated that they would file a lawsuit against Donnelly and MDY the next day in California federal court if MDY did not agree to stop selling Glider. Donnelly declined, and later that day filed this action in Arizona. MDY’s amended complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that Glider does not infringe rights owned by Blizzard. Blizzard filed a counterclaim and third-party complaint asserting seven claims: tortious interference with contract, contributory copyright infringement, vicarious copyright infringement, violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), trademark infringement, unfair competition, and unjust enrichment.

**III. Summary Judgment Motions**

The parties have now filed motions for summary judgment. Blizzard seeks summary judgment on the claims for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement, violation of the DMCA, and tortious interference with contract (Counts I-IV). MDY seeks summary judgment on all claims except trademark infringement (Count V). The parties have fully briefed the issues, and the Court heard oral argument on June 26, 2008. For the reasons stated below, the Court will grant the motions in part and deny them in part.

**IV. Summary Judgment Standard**

Summary judgment may be granted if “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact” and “the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). A party seeking summary judgment “always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit will preclude the entry of summary judgment, and the disputed evidence must be “such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).

**V. Blizzard’s Copyright Infringement Claims (Counts II and III)**

Section 106 of the Copyright Act grants the owner of a copyright the exclusive right to “copy” the copyrighted work; that is, to make a copy of the work, to prepare derivative works based on the work, or to distribute copies of the work to the public. 17 U.S.C. § 106(1)-(3); see S.O.S., Inc. v. Payday, Inc., 886 F.2d 1081, 1085 n.3 (9th Cir. 1989) (“copying” is shorthand for the copyright owner’s exclusive rights). Section 501 of the Act provides that “[a]nyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided by section[] 106 . . . is an infringer of the copyright[.]” 17 U.S.C. § 501(a). Copyright plaintiffs must therefore satisfy two requirements to establish direct infringement: (1) they must show that they own the allegedly infringed copyright, and (2) they must show that the alleged infringer has violated at least one of the exclusive rights granted under section 106. See A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004, 1013 (9th Cir. 2001).

A person commits contributory copyright infringement “by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement.” MGM Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 930 (2005). A person commits vicarious infringement “by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit it[.]” Id. Blizzard alleges that users of WoW are licensees who are permitted to copy the copyrighted game client software only in conformance with the EULA and TOU, and that when users launch WoW using Glider, they exceed the license in the EULA and TOU and create infringing copies of the game client software. Dkt. #10 ¶¶ 80-83, 91-92. MDY is liable for contributory copyright infringement, Blizzard claims, because it materially contributes to this direct infringement by Glider users. MDY allegedly does so by developing and selling Glider with the knowledge that Glider users will create infringing copies. Id. ¶¶ 85-87. MDY is liable for vicarious copyright infringement, Blizzard asserts, because it has the ability to stop the Glider-caused infringing activity and derives a financial benefit from that activity. Id. ¶¶ 93-95.

MDY does not dispute that it promotes the use of Glider in connection with WoW, that it controls Glider, or that it profits from Glider. MDY instead contends that it is not liable for contributory or vicarious copyright infringement because Glider users do not infringe Blizzard’s copyright. Dkt. #45 at 7-12. If Glider users violate terms of the EULA and TOU, MDY argues, they are merely breaching a contract, not infringing a copyright. Id. MDY also asserts a copyright misuse defense and an ownership defense under 17 U.S.C. § 117. Dkt. ##57, 69.
