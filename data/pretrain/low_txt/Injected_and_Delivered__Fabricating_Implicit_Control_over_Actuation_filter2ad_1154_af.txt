### Related Work

Several studies have explored various types of attacks on embedded sensors across different domains. For instance, Kune et al. [49] investigated plantable electrical devices. Park et al. [57] examined a saturation attack against infrared drop sensors to manipulate the dosage delivered by medical infusion pumps. In the automotive sector, Shoukry et al. [62] presented non-invasive spoofing attacks on magnetic wheel speed sensors in anti-lock braking systems. Yan et al. [74] explored contactless attacks against environment perception sensors in autonomous vehicles. Shin et al. [61] studied spoofing attacks on Lidar sensors in automotive systems to manipulate the detected distance of objects. Davidson et al. [42] investigated sensor input spoofing attacks against optical flow sensing in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Finally, Zhang et al. [77] introduced an inaudible attack on voice-controllable systems, injecting commands into microphones through ultrasonic carriers.

### Conclusion

Embedded sensors in control loops are crucial for the correct functioning of many control systems. A wide range of these systems rely on timely feedback from MEMS inertial sensors to make critical decisions. In this work, we developed two sets of novel attacks targeting embedded inertial sensors to deceive the system. Our evaluations on 25 devices demonstrated that it is possible to deliver implicit control to various systems through non-invasive attacks.

We characterized an out-of-band signal injection model and methods to manipulate oscillating digitized signals, which were often considered as noise, to deliver adversarial control. To explore the generalizability of our methods, we showed that oscillating digitized signals can also be manipulated by sending analog signals at relatively low frequencies through the sensing channel.
