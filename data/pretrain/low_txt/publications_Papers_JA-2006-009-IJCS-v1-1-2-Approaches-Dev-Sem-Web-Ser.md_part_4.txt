### Organizations and the Evolution of Workflow Using Ontologies

Ontologies play a pivotal role in the evolution of workflow technology. Figure 7 illustrates a solution for annotating WSDL interfaces with semantic metadata based on relevant ontologies [35]. Semantics can significantly enhance all stages of the Web process lifecycle, which are depicted in Figure 6.

**Figure 7: Semantic Annotation of a Web Service Specified with WSDL**

A Web service invocation requires an input interface that specifies the number of input parameters needed for proper execution and an output interface that defines the number of output parameters to hold and transfer the results to other services.

### A. Semantic Web Service Annotation

Today, Web service specifications are based on standards that only define syntactic characteristics. This is insufficient for the interoperation of Web services and processes. One of the best-recognized solutions for interoperability is to add meaning to methods and data, enabling applications to understand them. Many tools are available for creating Web services, primarily from programs written in Java or any object-oriented language. Technically, any program that communicates with remote entities using SOAP [33] can be called a Web service.

During Web service development, it is crucial to specify the data, functional, and Quality of Service (QoS) semantics. All Web services (operations in a WSDL file [34]) take a set of inputs and produce a set of outputs, represented in the operation signatures in a WSDL file. However, these signatures provide only syntactic information, not semantic meaning.

### B. Semantic Web Service Advertisement

After a service is developed and annotated, it must be advertised to enable discovery. The UDDI registry is intended to facilitate the success of service-oriented computing by leveraging the power of the Internet. However, the current UDDI-based discovery mechanism is inefficient, often retrieving inadequate services due to low precision and recall. To accelerate the adoption of Web services, more effective and scalable discovery mechanisms are required. These mechanisms should be based on Web service profiles with machine-processable semantics.

### C. Semantic Web Service Discovery

In the dynamic environment of e-businesses, the ability to find and integrate Web services on the fly is highly desirable. Discovery involves finding, selecting, and binding appropriate Web services to a Web process [36]. The general algorithm for semantic Web service discovery requires users to enter service requirements as templates constructed using ontological concepts. The algorithm matches Web services based on functionality, ranks them by semantic similarity, and optionally, ranks them based on preconditions and effects.

**Figure 8: State of the Art in Discovery (Cardoso, Bussler et al. 2005)**

### D. Semantic Web Service Selection

Web service selection is almost as important as service discovery. After discovering semantically matching services, the next step is to select the most suitable one. Each service may have different quality aspects, so selection involves locating the service that provides the best QoS match. Service selection is also critical in Web service composition, requiring the management of both domain-independent and domain-specific QoS metrics. An ontology defining these metrics can help interpret them as intended by the service provider.

### E. Semantic Process Composition

The power of Web services is realized when they are efficiently composed into Web processes, requiring a high degree of interoperability. Interoperability is crucial in e-commerce, where companies create business-to-customer and business-to-business links. Heterogeneous systems from multiple companies need to interoperate seamlessly. Sophisticated methods, such as the use of semantics, are essential to support the composition of Web processes. Languages like BPEL4WS [39], BPML [40], and WSCI [41] provide constructs for representing complex patterns of Web service compositions. When composing a process, the designer must consider the functionality, data, QoS, and execution patterns of the participating services.

### F. Semantic Processes Execution

Web services and Web processes promise to ease infrastructure challenges, such as data, application, and process integration. With the emergence of Web services, workflow management systems (WfMSs) become essential to support, manage, enact, and orchestrate Web processes. Execution semantics of a Web service include message sequences, conversation patterns, flow of actions, preconditions, and effects. Traditional formal mathematical models, concurrency formalisms, and simulation techniques can be used to represent execution semantics. Formal modeling for workflow scheduling and execution is also relevant.

### Conclusion

Since its creation, the World Wide Web has allowed computers to understand Web page layout for display purposes but not their intended meaning. The semantic Web aims to enrich the existing Web with a layer of machine-understandable metadata, enabling better cooperation between computers and people. The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) has been working on open standards like RDF and OWL to support this. Semantic Web services, which combine the syntactical definition of Web services with the semantic Web, are the result of this evolution. Three approaches—WSDL-S, OWL-S, and WSMO—have been developed to bring semantics to Web services. To fully harness the power of semantic Web services, their functionality must be combined to create semantic Web processes, allowing complex interactions among organizations and representing the evolution of workflow technology.
