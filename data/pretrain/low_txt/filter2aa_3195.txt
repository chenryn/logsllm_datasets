### Disinformation Overview
- **Definition:** Content with the purpose of misleading the public.
- **Intention:** To spread false or misleading information to achieve a specific goal.
- **Context:** Disinformation thrives during political unrest.

### Case Study: @ChalecosAmarill
- **Anti-Government Protests in Colombia (May 2021):**
  - A mysterious Twitter account (@Chalecosamarill) infiltrated Colombia-based political discussions.
  - Posted misleading content, using domestic hashtags and tweeting pro-Petro content.
  - Engaged with inauthentic Twitter networks pretending to be Petro supporters (November 2021).
  - Participated in a digital campaign to change Colombia’s Congress (November 2021).

### Background: Colombia
- **Closest South American ally to the U.S.**
- **Collaborated on national security and economic issues**
- **First leftist leader elected (Gustavo Petro, June 2022)**
- **Aligned on political concerns involving Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua**

### Who is Gustavo Petro?
- **President-elect of Colombia (June 2022)**
- **First leftist president of Colombia**
- **Friend of Fidel Castro (Cuba) and Hugo Chavez (Venezuela)**
- **Former Senator and friend of the FARC**
- **Stance towards the U.S.:**
  - Critical of U.S. economic sanctions
  - Does not favor an anti-narcotics agenda
  - Critical of extradition of criminals
  - Promotes rebuilding diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Venezuela

### Hypothesis and Result
- **Hypothesis:** The Venezuelan government attempted to influence perceptions in Colombia to help get Petro elected.
- **Result:** The Venezuelan government likely used a third-party firm to conduct information operations, including disinformation, to support Petro’s election.
  - **Who:** Likely the Venezuelan government
  - **Why:** Likely to soften U.S. foreign policy toward Venezuela
