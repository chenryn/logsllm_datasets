### Analysis of Traffic and Attack Patterns Post-Seizure

Following the seizure, DNS request volumes dropped to a global minimum, with an overall reduction exceeding 20% (as indicated by red30/red40). However, no significant reduction was observed for the IXP vantage point.

#### Key Findings
- **DNS Requests:** After the seizure, DNS requests fell to their lowest levels, with a reduction greater than 20%.
- **IXP Vantage Point:** No significant reduction in traffic was detected at the IXP vantage point.
- **Attack Volumes and Targets:** There was no significant decrease in the volume of attacks or the number of systems targeted. Surprisingly, we found a significant reduction in traffic flowing to DDoS reflectors, but no corresponding reduction in attack traffic from these reflectors to victims.
- **NTP DDoS Traffic:** To minimize the risk of false conclusions, we applied a filter based on NTP DDoS traffic characteristics (Section 4). This filter isolated IPs receiving NTP traffic with packets larger than 200 bytes from more than 10 hosts, with traffic peaks exceeding 1 Gbps. Even with this filter, no significant reduction in the number of attacked systems was observed (wt30/wt40).

### Takeaway
The observed traffic patterns correlate with the FBI seizure, showing significant reductions in DDoS traffic to potential DNS, NTP, and Memcached reflectors. However, there was no significant reduction in traffic from reflectors to victims. Using more reliable filters for NTP DDoS learned from self-attacks, we confirmed that the takedown did not significantly reduce the number of attacked systems. We conclude that seizing the front-end of Booter services does not improve the situation for DDoS victims, as the underlying reflector infrastructure remains operational and can be exploited by third parties without disruption.

### Conclusions
This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of booter-based DDoS attacks through the lens of a major IXP, a tier-1 ISP, and a tier-2 ISP. The study reveals that while the takedown operation led to a reduction in traffic to reflectors, it did not mitigate the impact on victims. This suggests that further action is needed to address the root causes of DDoS attacks.
