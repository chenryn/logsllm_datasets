# Prepay for Azure Data Explorer Markup Units with Azure Data Explorer Reserved Capacity

Save money on Azure Data Explorer by prepaying for markup units compared to pay-as-you-go prices. By purchasing Azure Data Explorer reserved capacity, you commit to using Azure Data Explorer for a period of one or three years, which provides a significant discount on the markup costs. To buy Azure Data Explorer reserved capacity, you only need to specify the term, and it will apply to all Azure Data Explorer deployments in all regions.

## How Reservations Work

When you purchase a reservation, you pre-pay for the markup costs for a period of one or three years. As soon as you buy a reservation, the Azure Data Explorer markup charges that match the reservation attributes are no longer billed at the pay-as-you-go rates. Both existing and newly deployed Azure Data Explorer clusters will automatically benefit from this discount. 

Note that this reservation does not cover compute, networking, or storage charges associated with the clusters. These resources require separate reserved capacity purchases. At the end of the reservation term, the billing benefit expires, and the Azure Data Explorer markup units are billed at the pay-as-you-go price. Reservations do not auto-renew. For pricing information, see the [Azure Data Explorer pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/data-explorer/).

## Purchase Requirements

To buy Azure Data Explorer reserved capacity, you must meet the following requirements:

- You must be the owner of at least one Enterprise or Pay-As-You-Go subscription.
- For Enterprise subscriptions, **Add Reserved Instances** must be enabled in the [EA portal](https://ea.azure.com). If this setting is disabled, you must be an EA Admin on the subscription.
- For the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program, only admin agents or sales agents can purchase Azure Data Explorer reserved capacity.

For details on how enterprise customers and Pay-As-You-Go customers are charged for reservation purchases, see:

- [Understand Azure reservation usage for your Pay-As-You-Go subscription](/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/understand-reserved-instance-usage)

## Determine the Right Markup Usage Before Purchase

The size of the reservation should be based on the total number of Azure Data Explorer markup units used by the existing or soon-to-be-deployed Azure Data Explorer clusters. The number of markup units is equal to the number of Azure Data Explorer engine cluster cores in production (excluding the dev/test SKU).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

6. Review the cost of the Azure Data Explorer markup reserved capacity reservation in the **Costs** section.
7. Select **Purchase**.
8. Select **View this Reservation** to see the status of your purchase.

## Cancellations and Exchanges

If you need to cancel your Azure Data Explorer reserved capacity reservation, there may be a 12% early termination fee. Refunds are based on the lower of your purchase price or the current price of the reservation, and are limited to $50,000 per year. The refund you receive is the remaining pro-rated balance minus the 12% early termination fee. To request a cancellation, go to the reservation in the Azure portal and select **Refund** to create a support request.

If you need to change your Azure Data Explorer reserved capacity reservation to another term, you can exchange it for another reservation of equal or greater value. The term start date for the new reservation does not carry over from the exchanged reservation; the 1 or 3-year term starts from when you create the new reservation. To request an exchange, go to the reservation in the Azure portal and select **Exchange** to create a support request.

For more information about exchanging or refunding reservations, see [Reservation exchanges and refunds](/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/exchange-and-refund-azure-reservations).
