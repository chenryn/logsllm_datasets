- **The Dark Art Lab**: Research blog run by Matt Wixey.
- **Previous Experience**: Worked in LEA, leading R&D team.

3. **Part III: Bantz (Fun Projects)**
4. **Part IV: Summary and Future Research**

## Disclaimers
- The views and opinions expressed in this talk are not necessarily those of PwC.
- All content is for educational purposes only. Familiarize yourself with relevant laws and only attack systems you own or have permission to attack.
- This presentation does not make me an electronics expert.

## Dunning-Kruger Curve
- **Me**: Somewhere on the curve, but not at the peak of Mt. Stupid.

## Key Terms
- **Modulation**: The process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform.
- **Ultrasonic**: Sounds above the range of human hearing (typically >20 kHz).
- **Near-Ultrasonic**: Sounds close to the upper limit of human hearing (e.g., 18-19 kHz).
- **Spectrogram**: A visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies in a sound as they vary with time.
- **Infrared (IR)**: Electromagnetic radiation with longer wavelengths than visible light.

## Part I: Jumping Air-Gaps
### A Sensor Darkly
- **Dreadphone**: C2 using near-ultrasonic sounds (18-19 kHz) via standard laptop soundcards.
- **Spectregram**: Visual representation of audio signals.

### Caveats
- Most research assumes the attacker has already infected at least one host.
- Physical or near-physical access is often required.
- Exfiltration typically involves small pieces of data.

### Previous Research
- **Van Eck Phreaking**: E.g., Kuhn (2003); Halevi and Saxena (2012)
- **AirHopper (Guri et al. 2014)**: Using radio frequencies.
- **BitWhisper (Guri et al. 2015)**: Using heat.
- **VisiSploit (Guri et al. 2016)**: Using codes and cameras.
- **Fansmitter (Guri et al. 2016)**: Acoustic exfiltration.
- **SPEAKE(a)R (Guri et al. 2016)**: Speakers to microphones.
- **xLED (Guri et al. 2017)**: Using router LEDs.
- **Hasan et al. (2013)**: Overview of techniques, including ALS for mobile devices.
- **ALS (Ambient Light Sensor)**: Common in laptops, monitors, smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches.

### Design
- **Plan**: Create malware to read light (lux) values from the ALS through the API.
- **Execution**: Malware executes different commands based on changes in light intensity.
- **Challenges**: Need exfiltration capability without obvious detection.

### Demo
- **Exfiltration**: Techniques and results.

## Part II: Surveillance and Counter-Surveillance
### Laser Microphone
- **Principle**: Convert sound to light and back to sound.
- **Application**: Listening through windows or other barriers.

### Passive Infrared Motion Detector
- **Bypasses**: Move slowly, mask body heat, overwhelm sensor with heat.
- **False Alarms**: Potential issues and mitigations.

### Drone to Clone to Pwn
- **Concept**: Use drones to clone and exploit IR signals.
- **Phone to Clone to Pwn**: Similar concept using smartphones.

### Active Infrared Motion Detector
- **Mitigations**: Use physical keypads, encrypted rolling code algorithms, anti-jamming, and unique pairing.

## Part III: Bantz (Fun Projects)
### DoubleSpeak
- **Delayed Auditory Feedback (Speech Jamming)**: Inspired by Kurihara and Tsukada (2012).

### Annoying Malware Analysts
- **Inspiration**: Domas (2015), "Psychological warfare in reverse engineering."
- **Implementation**: Malware where the flow graph in disassemblers represents an image.

### Kill More Gilmore
- **Functionality**: If the Gilmore Girls theme song plays, the TV turns off.

### AstroDrone
- **Ultrasonic Altimeters**: Many drones use ultrasonic altimeters, which can be exploited.
- **Effects**: Launches the drone upwards or causes it to stick to the floor.
- **References**: Liu et al. (2016), Robinson (2015), Son et al. (2015), Luo (2016).

### Animal Repellent Alarm
- **PIR Sensor**: Sends out an ultrasonic pulse if high sensitivity is detected.
- **Adjustable Frequency and Sensitivity**: 0-50 kHz.

## Part IV: Summary
### Research Overview
- **Ultrasound Malware**
- **ALS Malware**
- **Laser Mic**
- **Active IR Detector**
- **Passive IR Detector**
- **Kill More Gilmore**
- **Drones**
- **Speech Jamming**
- **Spectregram**
- **Light Sensors**
- **IR Sniffing and Replay**
- **Ultrasound**

### Pros & Cons
- **Pros**: Great for physical engagements, difficult to detect, cheap to design.
- **Cons**: Requires proximity, subject to interference, limited range and power.

### Mitigations
- **Awareness**: Know these techniques and attacks exist.
- **Block Inputs/Outputs**: Where possible, ensure reliable failover.
- **Clone-and-Replay Attacks**: Be aware of vulnerabilities.
- **Security Products**: Understand limitations and potential weaknesses.

### Future Research
- **Exfiltration via IR**
- **Acoustic Keylogging**
- **Further Work on Drone Repellents**
- **Tracking and Targeting**
- **Identification through Video**
- **Combination of Infrared and Sound**
