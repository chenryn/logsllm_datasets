## Vulnerability Protection
### Digital Vaccine® – Security Accuracy
| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Vulnerability** | A security flaw in a software program. |
| **Exploit** | A program that takes advantage of a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or block access to a network element, compute element, O/S, or application. |
| **Exploit Filter** | Written specifically for a particular exploit. Filter developers often use basic designs due to engine performance limitations, leading to missed attacks, false positives, and continued vulnerability risk. |

**Result:** Acts as a Virtual Software Patch

### Overview of the Attack
- **BIND Interface:** ISystemActivator
- **Interface ID:** 000001a0-0000-0000-c000-000000000046
- **Version:** v0.0
- **Function Call:** Opnum 4
- **Arguments:**
  - `\\server\file`
  - Server Port: 135/tcp
  - Interfaces Available:
    - e1af8308-5d1f-11c9-91a4-08002b14a0fa v3.0
    - 0b0a6584-9e0f-11cf-a3cf-00805f68cb1b v1.1
    - 975201b0-59ca-11d0-a8d5-00a0c90d8051 v1.0
    - e60c73e6-88f9-11cf-9af1-0020af6e72f4 v2.0
    - 99fcfec4-5260-101b-bbcb-00aa0021347a v0.0
    - b9e79e60-3d52-11ce-aaa1-00006901293f v0.2
    - 412f241e-c12a-11ce-abff-0020af6e7a17 v0.2
    - 00000136-0000-0000-c000-000000000046 v0.0
    - c6f3ee72-ce7e-11d1-b71e-00c04fc3111a v1.0
    - 4d9f4ab8-7d1c-11cf-861e-0020af6e7c57 v0.0
    - 000001a0-0000-0000-c000-000000000046 v0.0

- **Packets from Client:**
  - Pkt 1
  - Pkt 2
  - Pkt 3
  - Function Call 4, contains a heap-based buffer overflow in the server parameter.

### Vulnerability Filter
A vulnerability filter will check:
- TCP session established to the appropriate port (135)
- BIND to the appropriate RPC interface
- REQUEST the appropriate function call (opnum=4)
- Navigate to the vulnerable parameter
- Determine that an overlong server name has been supplied

**Pros:**
- High precision
- Hard to evade

**Cons:**
- Requires a powerful and fast filtering engine

### Exploit Filter
An exploit-specific filter detects the shell code used in a particular exploit. This can lead to high false negatives.

**Example:**
- EB 19 5E 31 C9 81 E9 89 FF FF FF 81 36 80 BF 32 94 81 EE FC FF FF FF E2 F2 EB 05 E8 E2 FF FF FF 03 53 06 1F 74 57 
- 75 95 80 BF BB 92 7F 89 5A 1A CE B1 DE 7C E1 BE 32

**Pros:**
- Simple string match
- Easy to design and implement
- Suitable for weak engines

**Cons:**
- High false negatives
- Filter is blind if the exploit is modified

### Policy Filter
A policy filter detects all BINDs to the vulnerable interface and will detect both legitimate traffic and attacks. It defines this traffic as unacceptable, such as spyware and pings from the internet.

**Pros:**
- Simple string match
- Easy to design and implement
- Suitable for weak engines

**Cons:**
- High false positives when used to detect exploitation of a vulnerability

**Example:**
- Snort's signature for the RPC DCOM overflow
  - `alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 135 (msg:"NETBIOS DCERPC ISystemActivator bind attempt"; flow:to_server,established; content:"|05|"; distance:0; within:1; content:"|0b|"; distance:1; within:1; byte_test:1,&,1,0,relative; content:"|A0 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 C0 00 00 00 00 00 00 46|"; distance:29; within:16; reference:cve,CAN-2003-0352; classtype:attempted-admin; sid:2192; rev:1;)`

### How does HP TippingPoint deal with it?
- **12 March, 2014:** ZDI disclosed to MS at Pwn2Own/Pwn4Fun
- **18 March, 2014:** TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID 13787
- **30 July, 2014:** Public release of advisory
- **Ahead by 113 days**

## Malware Detection and Communication Cut-off

### How can a hacker control your device?
- Virus
- SQL Injection
- Internet
- DDoS
- Phishing
- Trojan
- Worm

### Discovery
**Why Does Security Intelligence Matter?**
- Research
- Enterprise Ecosystem
- Infiltration
- Capture
- Exfiltration

### ThreatDV + Reputation Stops Attacks – Use Case: BlackPoS malware (used in Target Breach)
1. **ThreatDV filter detects BlackPOS data exfiltration attempts using naming convention matching in FTP.**
2. **Reputation provides protection using blacklisted IP addresses.**
3. **Attack is stopped!**

### ThreatDV + Reputation Stops Attacks – Use Case: ChewBacca TOR based malware example
1. **ThreatDV has Chewbacca specific malware filters that detect DNS queries to known Chewbacca CnC servers.**
2. **Reputation detects TOR exit nodes used in this attack.**
3. **Chewbacca traffic is detected by using a TOR network activity filter.**
4. **Attack is stopped!**

### How to Evaluate the Reputation of a Device?
- **Network Traffic in/out:**
  - Applications used
  - Traffic matching exploits
  - Good vs. bad traffic
- **Network Applications:**

  - Participation in scams
  - Participation in phishing
- **Device Reputation:**
  - Device behaving well?
  - Generating exploit traffic?
  - Part of botnet?
  - Hosting malware?
  - P2P Super Node?

## DDoS

### Real Case Study 1 (Stuff up the link of a manufacturer)
- **ICMP Fragmented Packet:**
  - ICMP Fragment events show up a peak on 5/31.
  - ICMP Fragment Flooding consumes bandwidth.
  - We found over 10,000,000 ICMP Fragmented Packets in one hour. The packet size is 1,500Bytes, consuming 33Mbps bandwidth.
- **Manufacture in SH, Data Center in TP:**

### Trend Analysis Helps Detect Abnormal Traffic in Real Time
- **Drill Down:**
  - We can see all attack sources (Inside IP-Botnet, Destination-Victim, Huge Amount).

### Real Case Study 2 (Brute Force Attack)
- **17:39, Brute Force AD event burst:**
  - We can find attackers in 1 minute.
