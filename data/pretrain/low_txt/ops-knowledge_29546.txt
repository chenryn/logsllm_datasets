### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:08:14 to 18:08:20 on October 18, highlights several recurring issues in a Hadoop environment. The key points are:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` process is unable to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
   - The failure persists for 197 to 202 seconds, with the system indicating that it will retry shortly.

2. **Resource Manager (RM) Communication Issues**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` process is failing to contact the Resource Manager (RM).
   - It is retrying to connect to the server `msra-sa-41:8030` with a retry policy of `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS)`.

3. **Address Changes**:
   - Both the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` processes detect address changes.
   - The old addresses are `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` and `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000`.
   - The new addresses are `msra-sa-41:8030` and `msra-sa-41:9000`.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Lease Renewal Failures**:
  - At 18:08:14, the `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 197 seconds.
  - At 18:08:15, the `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 198 seconds.
  - At 18:08:16, the `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 199 seconds.
  - At 18:08:17, the `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 200 seconds.
  - At 18:08:18, the `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 201 seconds.
  - At 18:08:19, the `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 202 seconds.

- **RM Communication Issues**:
  - At 18:08:16, 18:08:18, and 18:08:20, the `RMCommunicator Allocator` reports an error in contacting the RM.
  - At 18:08:16, 18:08:18, and 18:08:20, the `RMCommunicator Allocator` retries connecting to the server `msra-sa-41:8030` with the specified retry policy.

- **Address Changes**:
  - At 18:08:15, 18:08:16, 18:08:17, 18:08:18, and 18:08:19, both the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` processes detect address changes from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030` and from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.

### Conclusion

The log indicates persistent issues with lease renewal and RM communication, likely exacerbated by the detected address changes. These issues need to be addressed to ensure the stability and reliability of the Hadoop cluster.
