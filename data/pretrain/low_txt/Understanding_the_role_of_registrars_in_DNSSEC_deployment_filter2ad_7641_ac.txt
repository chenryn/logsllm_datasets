### DNSSEC Support Among Domain Registrars

- **✓** indicates that a DNS operator supports DNSSEC.
- **✗** indicates that a DNS operator does not support DNSSEC.
- **–** indicates that the information is not applicable or was not provided.
- **▲** indicates partial support, such as NameCheap, which only supports DNSSEC by default for certain plans [33].

If a DNS operator allows uploading a DS record via a web interface, we do not email them to inquire about accepting DS records via email. Only three of the operators support DNSSEC for the domains they manage, and only one (NameCheap) provides DNSSEC by default for these domains. Out of the 20 registrars, 11 support DNSSEC for external nameservers: eight provide web-based forms for uploading DS records, while three require emails with DS records. Only two of these registrars validate the provided DS records. Of the three that require emails, two do not verify the validity of the incoming email.

### Methodology

1. **DNSSEC Enablement and Verification:**
   - If we enable DNSSEC, we verify that the registrar correctly deploys all DNSSEC records by checking the existence of a DS record, its accordance with our DNSKEY, and the validity of the RRSIGs.

2. **Registrar Hosting Disabling:**
   - We then disable the registrar hosting and switch our domain to use an external nameserver we control. Our nameserver correctly publishes all DNSSEC records.

3. **DS Record Upload:**
   - Next, we examine whether the registrar allows us to upload a DS record via the web interface. If this feature is not available, we email the registrar to ask if there is another way to provide a DS record.

4. **DS Record Verification:**
   - If we can supply a DS record, we verify that our domain correctly deploys all DNSSEC records.

5. **Invalid DS Record Testing:**
   - We then upload a DS record that does not match our published DNSKEY to check if the registrar validates supplied DS records.

6. **Email Verification:**
   - Finally, if a registrar accepts a DS record via email, we send it from a different email address (one not used to register the domain) to see if they verify that the domain owner is sending the record.

### Observations

#### 5.2 Registrar as a DNS Operator

When using the registrar as the DNS operator, only three out of the 20 registrars (GoDaddy, NameCheap, and OVH) support DNSSEC. This is unfortunate because these cases present an easy path to DNSSEC deployment, as the registrar has full control over the domain and could create DNSKEYs, RRSIGs, and upload DS records on its own.

Among these three, only NameCheap enables DNSSEC by default, but only for some of their DNS plans. GoDaddy provides DNSSEC as a premium package ($35 per year), while OVH provides it for free but requires explicit opt-in.

From our December 31st, 2016 snapshot, we observe that:
- 25.9% of OVH domains deploy DNSSEC.
- 0.59% of NameCheap domains deploy DNSSEC.
- 0.02% of GoDaddy domains deploy DNSSEC.

The low adoption rate at GoDaddy highlights the importance of free and default support for DNSSEC in successful deployment.

We contacted an administrator at one of the registrars to understand why DNSSEC is an opt-in feature and why adoption is low. The reasons cited include:
1. The layout of the purchase page, which places the (free) option for DNSSEC alongside paid options.
2. Misconceptions among customers who believe DNSSEC causes issues for non-DNSSEC-supporting clients.
3. Concerns about DNS resolution performance, where requests for records in DNSSEC-supported domains may take longer to resolve.

#### 5.3 Owner as a DNS Operator

When the owner acts as the DNS operator (e.g., by hosting their own nameserver), only 11 out of 20 registrars support DNSSEC. Beyond the three discussed above, this includes eNom, HostGator, NameBright, DreamHost, Amazon, Google, 123-Reg, and Rightside.

Only three registrars (Amazon, Google, and Rightside) present a DS upload menu on their site when a user switches to an external nameserver. 123-reg requires a support ticket, and HostGator requires a live chat to upload DS records. While these methods are secure (HTTPS-secured), they are manual and prone to errors.

The remaining registrars do not provide details on their websites for enabling DNSSEC on third-party-operated domains. We contacted each registrar to inquire about DNSSEC support and found that three of them accept DS records via email, which is insecure due to the vulnerabilities in email communication.

#### 5.4 DS Record Validation

We checked how registrars validate uploaded DS records. Only two registrars (OVH and DreamHost) out of the 11 that support DNSSEC when the owner is the DNS operator correctly validate the DS record before accepting it. Amazon allows domain owners to upload their DNSKEY instead of the DS record, which is not ideal. The remaining registrars allow arbitrary data as DS records.

For registrars that require emailed DS records, we tested if they would accept an updated DS record without validating the email. Two of the three registrars did not attempt to verify the authenticity of the email, making them vulnerable to attacks. We informed these registrars of this security vulnerability.

### Summary

Overall, DNSSEC support among popular registrars is poor:
- Only three out of 20 registrars support DNSSEC for registrar-hosted domains.
- Only 11 out of 20 support DNSSEC for externally hosted domains.
- Of the three that support DNSSEC for registrar-hosted domains, only one does so by default, and even that is only for certain plans.
- One of the other two charges for the service.
- Only two providers reject a DS record that does not match the DNSKEY served from the external nameservers.
- Others accept anything as a DS record, making the zone fail to validate by DNSSEC-validating resolvers.

### 6. DNSSEC-Supporting Registrars

To better understand the behavior of registrars that support DNSSEC, we repeated the experiment focusing on the registrars with the largest number of domains with DNSKEYs. Specifically, we extracted .com, .net, and .org second-level domains that publish at least one DNSKEY record from our latest snapshot (December 31st, 2017). We grouped them by registrars and found that most support DNSSEC by default, but four support it partially depending on the TLD zone.

This detailed analysis provides a comprehensive view of DNSSEC support and the challenges faced in its deployment.
