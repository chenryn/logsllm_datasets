### Order-Preserving and Order-Revealing Encryption (OPE and ORE)

- **Introduction of OPE:**
  - Agrawal et al. [AKSX04] introduced OPE for encrypted database queries.
  - Boldyreva et al. [BCLO09] formalized the first explicit OPE construction.

- **Security and Stateful Solutions:**
  - Several works [BCO11, PR12, PLZ13, TYM14, KS14, Ker15, MCO+15, RACY15, BPP16] have explored security properties and stateful or interactive OPE solutions.
  - Stateless variants of OPE are commonly used in practice (e.g., SkyHigh Networks, CipherCloud).

- **Introduction of ORE:**
  - Boldyreva et al. [BCO11] introduced "efficiently-orderable encryption" (EOE).
  - Boneh et al. [BLR+15] provided the first ORE scheme with semantic security from multilinear maps.
  - Chenette et al. [CLWW16] proposed an efficient ORE scheme, which we improve and generalize.

- **Small-Domain ORE:**
  - Joye and Passelégue [JP16] constructed a small-domain ORE with best-possible security from one-way functions.
  - Cash et al. [CLOZ16] gave a pairing-based ORE with strictly stronger security than Chenette et al., using property-preserving hash functions.

### Searching on Encrypted Data

- **Techniques:**
  - Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) [SWP00, CGKO06, CK10]
  - Property-Preserving Encryption (PPE) [BCLO09, PR12, CD15]
  - Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) [Gen09]
  - Hidden Vector Encryption [BW07]
  - Oblivious RAMs (ORAM) [GO96]

- **Recent Advances:**
  - Cash et al. [CJJ+13, CJJ+14] introduced SSE schemes supporting Boolean queries and updates.
  - Faber et al. [FJK+15] extended these to support range queries.
  - Pappas et al. [PKV+14] developed BlindSeer, a private database management system for sublinear-time queries.

### Comparison to Our Techniques

- **Integration and Efficiency:**
  - Our ORE-based construction integrates well with existing database systems, requiring only a custom comparator.
  - It supports range queries without significant infrastructural changes and models adaptive updates.
  - Our construction uses symmetric primitives, avoiding more expensive public-key cryptography or oblivious transfer.

## Conclusions and Future Directions

- **New ORE Constructions:**
  - We presented two new ORE constructions using symmetric primitives, fitting into the left/right model.
  - These constructions are robust against inference attacks and can be used for efficient range queries.

- **Future Research:**
  - Constructing practical small-domain ORE with optimal security and sublinear ciphertext length.
  - Building left/right ORE schemes with semantically secure left and right ciphertexts.
  - Strengthening OPE lower bounds to rule out stateful or interactive schemes with best-possible security.
