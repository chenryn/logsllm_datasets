### Title: He Said, She Said â€“ Poisoned RDP Offense and Defense

Many readers are likely familiar with using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to connect to other machines. However, have you ever considered that simply using RDP could compromise your own computer?

In this talk, we will not focus on the typical RDP vulnerabilities where a server is attacked. Instead, we will demonstrate that connecting to a malicious machine can reliably and silently compromise your host. While there are numerous vulnerabilities in popular open-source RDP clients, our discussion will center on the Microsoft Terminal Services Client (MSTSC.EXE). We will delve into the primary synchronized resource between the client and the server: the clipboard. Through this deep dive, we will uncover an inherent design flaw in the resource synchronization, a problem also present in Hyper-V.

For attackers, this design flaw opens new avenues for escaping the sandbox. For defenders, there are methods to counteract this threat. With the right monitoring, this technique can be detected using internal Windows telemetry.

In this collaborative presentation, researchers from Check Point and Microsoft will share the inside story of the attack, providing insights from both offensive and defensive perspectives.
