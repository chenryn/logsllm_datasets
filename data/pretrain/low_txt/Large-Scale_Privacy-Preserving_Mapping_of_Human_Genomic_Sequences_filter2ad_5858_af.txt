### Computation and Privacy in Genetic Data Processing

We perform edit-distance calculations at the genetic locations identified by matches, a task offloaded to the private cloud. Our approach is carefully designed to shift the computational workload from the private cloud to the public cloud, while ensuring robust privacy protection and performance. This study demonstrates that, despite its simplicity, our method offers high privacy assurance and can efficiently handle computations of practical scale.

#### 7.1 Read Anonymization and Re-Identification

**Anonymizing Read Data:**
Unlike microarray data, which targets specific SNPs, sequencing reads are randomly drawn from the 6 billion nucleotides of the human genome. In a dataset with 1 million sequences of 100-bp long, approximately 40% of these reads carry SNPs, typically one per read. These SNPs, roughly 0.03% of the total 14 million SNPs, can be seen as randomly selected from the entire SNP set. This ratio can be even lower in human microbiome sequencing data, where about 1-8% of the reads are contaminated by the respective human host. Given that each random sample (all SNPs on the reads from one individual) is small relative to the total number of SNPs, the overlap between different individuals' sequence datasets, in terms of shared SNPs, is often insignificant.

**Re-identification Threat:**
Our research shows that simple techniques such as aggregation, noise addition, and data partitioning are insufficient to protect read data from an adversary with access to a reference population and a DNA sample from the victim. Specifically, consider a dataset whose reads are sampled from a population (referred to as the case group). We estimate the allele frequencies in the case group by aligning these reads to the reference genome. If a SNP site k is covered by m reads, and i of them have the major allele, the major allele frequency is calculated as \( f_k = \frac{i}{m} \). This frequency often deviates from the true major-allele frequency in the population because not all individuals' SNPs are sampled. Many SNP sites may not be covered by any read, resulting in zero frequencies. The case group here describes a group of human subjects whose reads are being analyzed.

**Figure 5. Effectiveness of Simple Mitigation Techniques:**

2. Noise Addition

These techniques aim to make re-identification more difficult but are not foolproof.
