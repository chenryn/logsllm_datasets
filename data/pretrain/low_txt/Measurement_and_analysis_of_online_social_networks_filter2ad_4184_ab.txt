### Mechanisms for Constructing Graphs with Specified Degree Distributions

Researchers have developed mechanisms to construct graphs with specified degree distributions [36] and have characterized the size of the largest connected component [37].

### Power-Law Networks

Power-law networks are characterized by the probability that a node has degree \( k \) being proportional to \( k^{-\gamma} \) for large \( k \) and \( \gamma > 1 \). The parameter \( \gamma \) is known as the power-law coefficient. Many real-world networks, including Internet topologies [16], the Web [9, 27], social networks [3], neural networks [11], and power grids [45], exhibit power-law properties.

### Scale-Free Networks

Scale-free networks are a subset of power-law networks where high-degree nodes tend to be connected to other high-degree nodes. These networks are discussed in detail by Li et al. [31], who propose a metric to measure the scale-freeness of graphs. The social networks we study display power-law distributions and, according to Li's measure, also exhibit scale-free properties.

### Small-World Networks

Small-world networks are characterized by a small diameter and high clustering. Studies have shown that the Web [5, 12], scientific collaboration on research papers [41], film actors [6], and general social networks [3] exhibit small-world properties. Kleinberg [23] proposes a model to explain the small-world phenomenon in offline social networks and examines navigability in these networks [22]. The online social networks examined in this paper also exhibit small-world properties similar to their offline counterparts.

## Measurement Methodology

### Data Collection and Methodology

In this section, we describe the data presented in this paper and the methodology used to collect it. We were unable to obtain data directly from the respective site operators due to their reluctance to provide even anonymized data. Signing non-disclosure agreements to obtain data from multiple competing sites was not feasible or desirable. Instead, we chose to crawl the user graphs by accessing the public web interface provided by the sites. This approach allowed us to access large datasets from multiple sites.

### Focus on the Large Weakly Connected Component (WCC)

The focus of this paper is to investigate the structure of online social networks. We concentrate on the large weakly connected component (WCC) of the corresponding graphs, as it is structurally the most "interesting" part of the network. Nodes not included in the WCC tend to be either part of very small, isolated clusters or are not connected to other users at all.

### Challenges in Crawling Large Graphs

Crawling large, complex graphs presents unique challenges. In this section, we describe our general approach before discussing the details of how we crawled each network.

#### Crawling the Entire Connected Component

The primary challenge in crawling large graphs is covering the entire connected component. At each step, one can generally only obtain the set of links into or out of a specified node. For online social networks, efficient crawling is crucial due to the large and highly dynamic nature of the graphs. Common algorithms for crawling graphs include breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search. Often, crawling an entire connected component is not feasible, and one must resort to using samples of the graph. Partial BFS crawls, such as the snowball method, can produce biased samples of nodes [29]. In social network graphs, the snowball method has been shown to underestimate the power-law coefficient but more closely match other metrics, including the overall clustering coefficient [29].

#### Using Only Forward Links

Crawling directed graphs, as opposed to undirected graphs, presents additional challenges. Many graphs can only be crawled by following links in the forward direction, which does not necessarily cover the entire WCC. Instead, it explores the connected component reachable from the set of seed users. This limitation is typical for studies that crawl online networks, including measurement studies of the Web [12].

### Crawling Social Networks

We now discuss our methodology for crawling each of the networks, its limitations, and high-level statistics of the resulting datasets. Using automated scripts on a cluster of 58 machines, we crawled the social network graphs of Flickr, LiveJournal, Orkut, and YouTube. High-level statistics of the resulting datasets are presented in Table 1.

#### Flickr

Flickr (www.flickr.com) is a photo-sharing site based on a social network. Our Flickr data, from a crawl of the large WCC conducted on January 9th, 2007, contains over 1.8 million users and 22 million links. We used Flickr's API to conduct the crawl and obtain group membership information. Flickr only allows querying for forward links, so we could not crawl the entire large WCC. To estimate the fraction of users in the WCC but missing in our crawl, we performed an experiment using randomly generated user identifiers. We found that 26.9% of the randomly generated users were discovered during our crawl. Further analysis showed that many of the missed users had low degrees and were connected to small, isolated clusters.

#### LiveJournal

LiveJournal (www.livejournal.com) is a popular blogging site with a social network. Our LiveJournal dataset, containing over 5.2 million users and 72 million links, was crawled from December 9-11, 2006. LiveJournal's API allows querying for both forward and reverse links, enabling us to crawl the entire large WCC. To estimate the coverage, we used a feature that returns random users and found that 95.4% of the 5,000 random users were already in our crawl. Additional analysis showed that the missed users were part of small, isolated clusters.

#### Orkut

Orkut (www.orkut.com) is a social networking site run by Google. Orkut's links are undirected and require consent from the target. New users must be invited by existing users, making the Orkut graph a single strongly connected component (SCC). Our Orkut data, collected between October 3rd and November 11th, 2006, covers 11.3% of Orkut's user population. Due to the lack of an API, we used HTML screen-scraping, which required more bandwidth and time. We conducted five small crawls starting from random locations to ensure the representativeness of our sample. The results indicated that our 11.3% sample is likely to be similar to other samples of similar size, but caution is advised when extrapolating to the entire Orkut network due to potential sampling bias.

#### YouTube

YouTube (www.youtube.com) is a video-sharing site with a social network. Our YouTube data, obtained on January 15th, 2007, consists of over 1.1 million users and 4.9 million links. Similar to Flickr, YouTube's API only allows querying forward links. We were unable to create a random sample of YouTube users due to the non-standard format of user identifiers. Group membership information was obtained by screen-scraping HTML pages. Caution is advised in extrapolating the YouTube results to the entire population, as we do not know the number of users who do not participate in the social network.

### Summary of Results

- **Flickr and YouTube**: The data sets may not contain some nodes in the large WCC, but this fraction is likely to be very small.
- **LiveJournal**: The data set covers almost the complete population of LiveJournal and contains the entire large WCC.
- **Orkut**: The data set represents a modest portion of the network and is subject to sampling bias from a partial BFS crawl.

The vast majority of missed nodes in Flickr, LiveJournal, and YouTube have low degrees and are likely part of small, isolated clusters. Based on the number of users published by the sites, we estimate the fraction of nodes covered as follows: 26.9% for Flickr, 95.4% for LiveJournal, and 11.3% for Orkut. The data sets are available to the research community, anonymized to ensure the privacy of the social network users.

### High-Level Statistics

Table 1 presents the high-level statistics of the data we gathered. The crawled network sizes vary by almost a factor of five (1.1 million users in YouTube vs. 5.2 million in LiveJournal), and the number of links varies by almost two orders of magnitude (4.9 million in YouTube versus 223 million in Orkut). Other metrics, such as the average number of friend links per node and user participation in shared interest groups, also vary by two to three orders of magnitude. Despite these differences, our analysis will show that these graphs share a surprisingly large number of key structural properties.

### Web Graph Analysis

The Web is one of the most well-studied online networks, and our study shares much of its methodology with previous Web studies. It is natural to compare the structure of online social networks to the Web. However, we are aware that the user graph in social networks is fundamentally different from the Web graph. Our comparisons serve more to provide a point of reference for our results than to highlight expected differences. We cite previous studies of the Web structure and performed some of our own analysis using data collected by the Stanford WebBase Project [1] during their December 2003 crawl.

## Analysis of Network Structure

In this section, we characterize the structural properties of the four networks we measured. We compare the networks to each other and to the properties previously observed for the Web.
