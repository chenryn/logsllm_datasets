**ATT&CK ID:** T1127  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution

Adversaries may exploit trusted developer utilities to execute malicious payloads. These utilities, commonly used for software development, debugging, and reverse engineering, can be leveraged to run code in various formats. Often, these tools are signed with legitimate certificates, allowing them to execute on a system. By using these trusted utilities, adversaries can proxy the execution of malicious code through a legitimate process, thereby bypassing application control measures.

### Key Points:
- **Trusted Developer Utilities:** Tools used for software development, debugging, and reverse engineering.
- **Execution of Malicious Payloads:** Adversaries use these utilities to execute malicious code.
- **Legitimate Certificates:** Many of these utilities are signed with valid certificates, making them appear trustworthy.
- **Bypassing Application Control:** The use of trusted processes allows adversaries to circumvent security controls.
