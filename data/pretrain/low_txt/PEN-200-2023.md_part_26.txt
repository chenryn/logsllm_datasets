### Figure 54: Result Dashboard
The initial view of the dashboard displays the **Hosts** page, which lists all scanned hosts and provides a visual representation of the vulnerability data. This allows for quick identification of critical findings and an overview of each system's security status. In the bottom right corner, Nessus presents a visual summary of the distribution of vulnerability information across all targets. Above this, general information about the vulnerability scan is provided.

**Note:** Nessus plugins are frequently updated. Therefore, the findings and information presented in this Learning Unit may differ slightly from your actual vulnerability scan results.

### Accessing Specific Host Findings
To view the list of findings for a specific host, click on the corresponding entry. For example, let's select the entry for **192.168.50.124**.

### Figure 55: Vulnerability Result Dashboard of 192.168.50.124
The **Severity** column provides a quick indicator of the criticality of each finding. In Figure 55, three findings are marked with **MIXED** severity, indicating that Nessus has grouped these findings. The **Count** column shows the number of findings in each group. Clicking on a grouped finding will display a detailed list of all findings within that group. Let's click on **Apache Httpd (Multiple Issues)**, listed under the **Family** column as **Web Servers**.

### Figure 56: List of Grouped Findings
Figure 56 provides detailed information on the previously grouped findings. Clicking on a specific finding, such as **Apache 2.4.49 < 2.4.51 Path Traversal Vulnerability**, reveals more detailed information.

### Figure 57: Detailed Information of a Finding
Each finding includes extensive information about the vulnerability, the plugin that detected it, the associated risk, the status of exploits, and other relevant references.

### Navigating Back to the Results Dashboard
Next, navigate back to the results dashboard (Figure 54) to further explore the scan. Analyzing the findings of a single target provides detailed information, but often, we need an overview of the most critical vulnerabilities across all targets. Nessus offers a feature called **VPR Top Threats**, which uses the **Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR)** to generate a prioritized list of the top ten vulnerabilities.

### Figure 58: VPR List of Vulnerabilities
In our example, the VPR list contains only six vulnerabilities, as Nessus did not find more with our configuration.

**Note:** Depending on the Nessus version, the **VPR Top Threats** tab may be missing, but each vulnerability finding still includes the **Vulnerability Priority Rating**.

### Remediation Page
The **Remediations** page provides strategies or information on how to mitigate detected vulnerabilities. For example, the Apache vulnerabilities from Figure 55 offer the following remediation information.

### Figure 59: Remediation of Vulnerabilities

### History Page
The **History** page lists all vulnerability scans with the current configuration, allowing for review and comparison of previous scan results.

### Creating a PDF Report
Now, let's create a PDF report of our vulnerability scan using the **Report** dashboard. This dashboard also includes functions for changing scan configurations, launching new scans, exporting data, and configuring an **Audit Trail** to analyze plugin behavior and reduce false negatives.

### Figure 60: Create a Report
Clicking on **Report** opens a new window with different report templates. Each template generates the report with a different structure, focus, and content.

### Figure 61: Select the Report Format and Template
For this example, we'll use the **Detailed Vulnerabilities By Host** template, select **PDF** as the format, and click **Generate Report**. After generating, we can download or open the PDF report.

**Note:** For a summary of vulnerabilities, you can use the **Complete List of Vulnerabilities by Host** template. For more customization options, consult the Tenable Documentation.

### Performing an Authenticated Vulnerability Scan
In this section, we will perform an authenticated vulnerability scan by providing credentials to Nessus. Authenticated scans provide more detailed information and reduce false positives. We will use an authenticated scan against the target **DESKTOP**.

**Note:** An authenticated scan generates significant network traffic and system noise, such as log entries and AV notifications.

### Figure 62: Creating a New Scan
Click **New Scan** on the Nessus dashboard. We will use the **Credentialed Patch Audit** scan template, which is preconfigured to execute local security checks.

### Figure 63: Select Credentialed Patch Audit
Provide a name for the scan and set the target to **DESKTOP**.

### Figure 64: Basic Settings for the Authenticated Scan
Click on the **Credentials** tab, select **SSH** in the **Host** category, and enter the necessary authentication details. For this example, we will use **password** authentication with the username **offsec** and password **lab**. Select **sudo** for privilege elevation, with the sudo user **root** and password **lab**.

### Available Authentication Mechanisms
While we use SSH for this example, other mechanisms are available. For a complete list, consult the Tenable Documentation. For Linux and macOS, SSH is used, while for Windows, **SMB** and **WMI** are typically used. Ensure the target system is correctly configured, with no firewall blocking connections and AV exceptions or temporary disabling if needed. Also, consider **User Account Control (UAC)** settings on Windows.

### Figure 65: SSH and Sudo Credentials for the Authenticated Scan

### Reviewing Authenticated Scan Results
After the scan, review the results on the **Vulnerabilities** page. To disable grouping of findings, click the wheel icon and select **Disable Groups**.

### Figure 66: Disable Grouped Results
This will list each finding separately.

### Figure 67: Authenticated Scan Results
The results include vulnerabilities from the **Ubuntu Local Security Checks** plugin family, which checks for local vulnerabilities and missing patches on Ubuntu systems.

### Figure 68: Vulnerability Data of Firefox and curl
The list also includes vulnerability data for locally exposed applications like **Firefox** and **cURL**.

### Working with Nessus Plugins
By default, Nessus enables several plugins when running a default template. However, you can fine-tune the options to run a single plugin, useful for validating findings or quickly discovering specific vulnerabilities.

### Example: Checking for CVE-2021-3156
We will set a plugin filter to identify if the **DESKTOP** machine is vulnerable to **CVE-2021-3156**. This is a locally exploitable vulnerability that allows an unprivileged user to elevate privileges to root.

### Figure 69: Creating a New Scan
Use the **Advanced Dynamic Scan** template, which allows for dynamic plugin filtering.

### Figure 70: Select Advanced Dynamic Scan
Configure the name and target.

### Figure 71: Enter Name and Target
Provide the same SSH and sudo credentials as before.

### Figure 72: Filter for Specific Plugins
Click on the **Dynamic Plugins** tab, select **CVE** in the left dropdown menu, choose the appropriate filter arguments, and specify the CVE number **CVE-2021-3156**. Click **Preview Plugins** to see the list of found plugin families.

### Figure 73: Select Family of Plugins Covering CVE-2021-3156
You can combine multiple filters. For example, add a filter to specify the **Ubuntu Local Security Checks** plugin family.

### Figure 74: Add Filter
Add a new filter by clicking the plus button next to the first filter. Select the **Ubuntu Local Security Checks** plugin family to restrict the search.
