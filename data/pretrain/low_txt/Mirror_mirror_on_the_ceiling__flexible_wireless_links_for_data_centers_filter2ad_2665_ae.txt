### Traffic Delegation and Radio Assignment Optimization

When traffic is delegated to the wireless network, more racks carry moderate traffic, leaving some radios available for reassignment. In such cases, optimizing radio assignment can provide a moderate benefit, which is ultimately limited by the overhead of antenna rotation delay, as shown in Figure 8(b).

We also compared the number of rotations performed by each rotator using two different schedulers. The results in Table 1 indicate that, depending on the traffic load, intelligent radio assignment can reduce rotator usage by up to 27%.

### Summary of Findings

- **Random Traffic Patterns:** In data centers with random traffic patterns, 2D beamforming restricted to neighboring racks can address only a very limited (approximately 3%) portion of traffic hotspots, compared to 100% for single-hop 3D beamforming links.
- **Bursty Traffic Hotspots:** For scenarios involving bursty traffic hotspots, using 3D beamforming links in conjunction with the existing wired network can generally reduce completion time by half or more.
- **Antenna Rotation Delays:** When dealing with sizable payloads, such as 128MB, antenna rotation delays contribute only a small portion of the overall completion time. Much of this delay can be mitigated using simple heuristics, such as selecting radios closer to the desired transmission angle.

### Deployment Challenges

#### Physical Rack/Reflector Placement
3D beamforming performs best when there are no obstacles between the top of the rack/container and the ceiling. Data center managers should avoid obstacles like cables and cooling pipes when arranging racks/containers and ceiling reflectors. This is not an issue for container-based data centers [10]. For other types, raised floors can house cables and pipes, and suspended cable trays can be concealed within aluminum-plated ducts to lower the reflection point from the ceiling. Multi-hop transmissions or reflections off walls can be used to route around unavoidable obstacles. An open question is whether physical rack and reflector placement can be jointly optimized with network communication patterns.

#### Reflector Curvature
Our experiments show that 3D beamforming performance is sensitive to the curvature of the reflector. A flat surface allows the beam to propagate following the free-space model. Slight concavity increases the measured RSS value, while convexity decreases it. This may be due to multipath signals degrading link performance. Ideally, the reflector should be kept as flat as possible. However, it remains an open question whether manipulating reflector curvature can further improve 3D beamforming performance.

#### Rotator Reliability
To communicate with different racks, each transceiver must adjust its beam direction in both azimuth and elevation. For radios with horn antennas, this requires a mechanical rotator, leading to extra rotation delay and reliability issues. Current pan-tilt rotators offer about 3-5 million cycle durability [4] or 15,000-hour lifetime [9]. The failure rates of these components must be considered against their performance when choosing between horn antennas and antenna arrays.

#### Antenna Arrays
The concerns with rotator delay and reliability can be addressed by replacing horn antennas with switched beam smart antennas or antenna arrays. Antenna arrays use electronic beam rotation with delays as low as 50ns in existing 16-element arrays [40]. However, they still do not eliminate issues of link blockage or interference and produce more signal leakage than horn antennas, leading to weaker link signal strength and stronger interference to neighboring flows [46]. One potential solution is to configure beam patterns to steer away from neighboring links or nullify interference [33]. We leave the exploration of these issues for future study.

### Related Work

#### Data Center Networks
Most prior work addresses traffic congestion through network architecture design and traffic scheduling [11, 13, 14, 18, 21, 22], or modeling network traffic characteristics [15, 16, 25, 17]. 60 GHz wireless was first proposed for data center networking in [35] to reduce cabling complexity. Recent proposals use wireless links to augment [23, 26] or replace [38] wired links. Our work identifies practical issues of existing approaches and proposes a new beamforming paradigm to effectively address these issues.

While prior work has applied the principle of radio signal reflection to connect non-line-of-sight links [35] or reduce WiFi interference [31], we generalize it to 60 GHz links. Our key contribution is using ceiling reflection in the data center to extend connectivity and suppress interference, validated through detailed hardware experiments.

Optical circuit switching [20, 39, 42] is an alternative for adding burst bandwidth to data centers. It promises high bandwidth but incurs substantial cost and does not offer the benefits of wireless augmentation, such as reduced cost and deployment complexity.

#### 60 GHz Wireless Technology
Prior work mainly focuses on radio and antenna design issues [8, 40], and signal propagation and reflection modeling [37, 45, 12, 30, 36]. Today, there is a wide selection of commercial 60 GHz radio products [5]. One recent effort [40] developed a 16-element on-chip antenna array, allowing each radio to switch a beam to any of the 32 predefined directions within 50ns. Our work leverages readily available hardware and focuses on designing new wireless interconnects explicitly for data centers.

### Conclusion

Traffic in today's data centers is unpredictable, often producing traffic hotspots that result in congestion and delay. Instead of overprovisioning the wired network, we advocate using 60 GHz wireless beamforming links to alleviate traffic hotspots as they occur. Our work addresses limitations of 60 GHz beamforming caused by signal blockage and interference. By aiming 60 GHz beamforming links at a reflective ceiling, we can achieve indirect line-of-sight between most or all rack pairs, minimizing interference. The net effect is that 3D beamforming greatly expands the reach and capacity of 60 GHz links, making them feasible as flexible and reconfigurable alternatives to wired cabling. Our testbed measurements confirm that 3D beamforming links suffer zero energy loss from reflection and effectively avoid blocking obstacles and reduce interference footprint.

While wired networks will continue to serve high-end data center needs, efforts such as 3D beamforming can provide significant benefits to a broad range of data center deployments by potentially reducing deployment complexity and cost compared to a fully provisioned wired network.
