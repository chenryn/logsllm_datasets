### User Behavior Analysis through Android IP Camera Apps

Diao et al. [36] recently investigated the use of global interrupt counters in `procfs` to infer user unlock patterns and foreground applications.

### Mobile Sensor-Based Side Channels

Several studies have explored the use of mobile sensors to construct side channels. These include location leakage via GPS [44, 55], accelerometers [23, 41, 47, 53, 59], magnetometers [57], gyroscopes [50, 52, 59], and orientation sensors [29, 63]. These sensors can be exploited to infer a user's location, movement, and even keystrokes (thus revealing PINs and passwords). Most of these studies focused on sensor-based side channels in Android. Unlike Android, iOS requires special entitlements for third-party apps to access these sensors. For example, an iOS app must explicitly request authorization from the user to access GPS information [7]. Starting from iOS 10, developers must also include `NSMotionUsageDescription` in `Info.plist` to use motion sensors such as accelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes [19]. However, once permission is granted, similar side-channel attacks can be conducted on iOS devices.

### Previous Research on iOS Side Channels

There has been limited research on iOS side channels, and their threat models differ significantly from our work. For instance, Marquardt et al. [48] used accelerometers on the iPhone 4 to perform inference attacks against a keyboard placed next to the device, while our work targets other apps on the same device. Genkin et al. [39] demonstrated that ECDSA keys used in OpenSSL and CoreBitcoin on iPhones can be extracted using magnetic probes or power probes connected to the USB cable. Our attacks do not assume physical possession of the device by the attacker, so magnetic or power attacks are outside the scope of our threat model.

### Security Studies on iOS

Some existing studies focus on iOS security but not on side-channel leakage. Wang et al. [60] proposed a method to inject exploitable vulnerabilities in iOS apps to bypass the app vetting process. Xing et al. [62] discovered a series of flaws in iOS and macOS, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data from other apps. Deshotels et al. [35] examined flaws in iOS sandbox profiles and showed how an app could exploit them to learn sensitive information about the user.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we present the first exploration of OS-level side channels on iOS. Although iOS does not have `procfs` or permit querying per-app statistics, there are still APIs that allow a third-party app to query global statistics of memory and network resources or to construct timing channels to break filesystem sandboxes. We demonstrate three categories of side-channel attacks that exploit these APIs to extract private user information, including inferring foreground apps, fingerprinting visited websites, identifying map searches, de-anonymizing Bitcoin Wallet users, and detecting installed apps. These attacks show that cross-app side-channel attacks on iOS are feasible, similar to those on Android. Our study has helped Apple mitigate these security threats in iOS and macOS.
