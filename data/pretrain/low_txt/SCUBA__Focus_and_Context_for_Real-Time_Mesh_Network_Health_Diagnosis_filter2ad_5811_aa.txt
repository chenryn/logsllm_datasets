## Abstract
Large-scale wireless metro-mesh networks, comprising hundreds of routers and thousands of clients, often suffer from a myriad of performance issues. The scale of these networks, the abundance of performance metrics, and the lack of effective diagnostic tools can quickly overwhelm network operators. To address this, we introduce SCUBA, an interactive focus and context visualization framework for real-time mesh network health diagnosis. SCUBA organizes performance metrics into multiple tiers or contexts, displaying only the topmost context by default to reduce visual clutter and provide a broad overview of network performance. Network operators can interactively focus on problem areas and zoom in to reveal more detailed contexts. We demonstrate SCUBA's effectiveness using a nearly 500-node mesh and a 15-node testbed, showing how it facilitates and expedites health diagnosis. We also discuss future research directions in focus and context visualization and efficient metrics collection for rapid and effective mesh network health diagnosis.

## 1. Introduction
Metro-scale wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are being deployed worldwide in city centers, shopping malls, and residential areas. Despite significant investments, these networks face numerous performance issues, such as weak client connectivity due to signal attenuation, external interference, and misconfigured client nodes. These problems have hindered the market penetration of WMN technology, leading to diminishing business prospects.

Effective diagnosis and troubleshooting are crucial for the success of metro-scale WMNs. While many novel metrics and techniques have been proposed, the sheer volume of data collected from each device can be overwhelming for network operators. Traditional diagnostic tools use visualization techniques like time-series plots and planar graphs, but these can be tedious and time-consuming in large-scale WMNs. We believe that structured visualization techniques can help operators quickly navigate through metrics and diagnose problems. Research has shown that good visualizations can significantly reduce the time and effort required to evaluate large volumes of information [11,10,8]. However, diagnostic visualizations for large-scale WMNs have received little attention. In this paper, we argue that WMNs can benefit from advanced visualization tools, especially given their increasing size and complexity.

To this end, we propose SCUBA, a focus and context visualization framework. SCUBA organizes performance metrics into several tiers or contexts. The topmost context provides a broad overview of WMN performance, allowing operators to quickly identify and locate problems. Once a problem location is determined, the operator can focus on the problem region and zoom in to reveal more detailed contexts. This approach enables operators to expose a larger set of metrics within a small focal region to diagnose the cause of a performance problem.

In this paper, we organize metrics into three contexts (route, link, and client) with increasing detail. The placement of metrics is based on our experience diagnosing WMN problems [5]. SCUBA's main objective is to facilitate focus and context visualization for any scheme. Future work will explore different schemes derived from common diagnostic approaches to define better contexts and metric placements.

We use the Google Mountain View WMN map of about 500 routers and gateways to explain SCUBA's contexts, metrics, and views. We also implement SCUBA on a 15-node UCSB MeshNet to demonstrate its ease of use in diagnosing a sample performance problem and to discuss deployment challenges.

## 2. SCUBA: Focus and Context Visualizations
The primary goal of SCUBA is to facilitate fast and easy diagnosis of WMN performance problems by organizing performance metrics for focus and context visualizations. In this section, we discuss the metrics collection architecture, the organization of metrics into contexts, the different views SCUBA offers, and the visualization features implemented.

### 2.1 Metrics Collection Architecture
SCUBA collects and computes performance metrics from routers and gateways in a WMN. Each router sends a set of metrics to the SCUBA server via the gateway. The SCUBA server stores these metrics in a database for temporal trend analysis and in a data structure in main memory for fast access by the visualization engine. The visualization engine is a standalone Java application written using the Swing GUI toolkit. We discuss the computation and collection of metrics specifically within the UCSB MeshNet in Section 3.

### 2.2 SCUBA’s Contexts
One of the main obstacles to diagnosing problems in WMNs is their scale and the abundance of performance metrics. To better organize the collected information, we propose placing WMN performance metrics into several contexts, where each context consists of one or more metrics.

- **Route Context:** The topmost context displays multi-hop routes between each router and its corresponding Internet gateway. It includes two metrics: throughput of TCP flows and round-trip time (RTT) of UDP packets. Any significant drop in these values indicates a serious performance problem, allowing operators to zoom into the problem region to understand the cause.
- **Link Context:** The link context reveals the expected transmission count (ETX) on a link between nodes. ETX provides a good estimate of the health of links, which can impact the quality of routes. Poor link quality, identified by an increase in ETX, can be caused by heavy traffic, external interference, or signal attenuation.
- **Client Context:** The client context provides further insight into the cause of poor quality links. It includes four metrics: the number of clients associated with each router, percentage channel utilization per client, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and volume of external interference. These metrics help isolate the causes of poor link quality, such as a large number of clients with high channel utilization or external interference.

### 2.3 Diagnostic Approaches and the Design of SCUBA
The current version of SCUBA is designed based on our experience building and deploying a WMN and diagnosing problems using a logical top-to-bottom approach. Future work will evaluate additional contexts, such as traffic and application, for increased diagnostic flexibility. While our scheme is general enough to diagnose a wide variety of problems, it does not represent an all-inclusive set of metrics or the only scheme of context organization. SCUBA can be modified to utilize different schemes based on the diagnostic approaches preferred by operators. The effectiveness of SCUBA should be evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively in specific scenarios, using metrics such as ease of use, speed of problem diagnosis, and the number of problems it helps diagnose.

### 2.4 SCUBA Visualization Features
SCUBA uses various visualization features to communicate WMN health, including different color and size schemes. The visualization policy is to highlight problems, resulting in fast and easy diagnosis. SCUBA's visualizations are interactive, allowing for continuous pan and zoom and tool-tip-style data readouts on mouse-over and selection. The visualization features include:

- **WMN Nodes:** We assume a typical WMN backbone consists of two types of nodes: routers and gateways. Routers are displayed as circles, and gateways as squares. The size and color of the nodes indicate their health status.
- **Routes and Links:** Routes are displayed as lines connecting routers to gateways, and links as lines connecting neighboring routers. The thickness and color of the lines indicate the health of the routes and links.
- **Clients:** Clients are displayed as smaller circles connected to the routers. The size and color of the client circles indicate their connection quality and channel utilization.

These features are illustrated in Figure 2, which shows examples of route throughput, RTT, link ETX, and client channel utilization and signal strengths.

## Conclusion
SCUBA is a powerful tool for real-time mesh network health diagnosis, providing a structured and interactive way to visualize and diagnose performance issues. By organizing metrics into multiple contexts and offering interactive visualization features, SCUBA enables network operators to quickly identify and resolve problems in large-scale WMNs. Future work will explore additional diagnostic approaches and evaluate the effectiveness of SCUBA in various scenarios.
