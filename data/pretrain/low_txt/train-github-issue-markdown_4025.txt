Hello,

I am encountering an issue while attempting to download a customized Bootstrap 3 file using Safari. When I click the download link, a new, empty tab opens, but the download does not proceed. However, I was able to successfully download the file using Firefox.

Here are the details of my setup:
- **Safari Version:** 6.1 (8537.71)
- **Operating System:** OS X 10.8.5

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
Tamara
