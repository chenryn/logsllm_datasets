## Abstract
This panel will explore the integration of security topics into academic programs and discuss future directions for improvement. The discussion will address the optimal timing for introducing security concepts in computer science and software engineering curricula and identify the essential knowledge that every graduating student should possess. We will distinguish between practical and purely academic concepts and evaluate how well current security education prepares students for industry needs. Specifically, we will consider whether graduates have a sufficiently deep and broad understanding of security to be effective in their careers. Additionally, we will identify the challenges in current security education and propose ways for the academic community to collaborate with industry and government to enhance security education.
