### Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of various distance bounding protocols and their security against relay attacks. The focus is on the verification of these protocols using an applied pi-calculus-based modeling framework. We present a detailed examination of several payment protocols, including those by MasterCard and NXP, and highlight the importance of our proposed uncompromised distance bounding property.

### Protocol Analysis

#### Example 1 (Section 2)
- **PaySafe**
- **PaySafe with changes [28]**
- **MasterCard’s RRP**
- **NXP’s protocol (unique keys)**
- **NXP’s protocol (global key)**
- **NXP’s variant 1 (unique keys)**
- **NXP’s variant 2 (unique keys)**
- **Meadows et al. [30]**
- **MAD (One-Way) [36]**
- **CRCS [32]**
- **Hancke and Kuhn [24]**
- **Poulidor [35]**
- **Tree-based [5]**
- **Uniform [29]**

#### Table 1: Results of Our Verification
- **Distance Bounding Method**: The last four protocols use the same underlying distance bounding method.
- **Security Goals**: All payment protocols meet their security goals regarding relay attacks.

### Security Analysis

#### NXP’s Protocols
- **Unique Key for Every Device**: Provides the same security against relay attacks as MasterCard’s RRP and PaySafe.
- **ISO/IEC 14443 Protocol**: Distance and terrorist fraud attacks are not applicable due to this underlying protocol.
- **Global Key**: If a global key is shared across multiple devices, security against relay attacks holds, but uncompromised distance bounding security does not. This is because the compromise of one device compromises the entire system, representing a significant security risk. For example, a single compromised key fob could put all cars at risk.

#### Authentication of Timing Information
- **MasterCard’s RRP, PaySafe, and NXP’s Protocols with Unique Keys**: Correctly bind the identity to the timing information.
- **NXP’s Protocol with Global Key**: Does not authenticate the identity, so we check the timing information against session nonces, which it correctly binds. Therefore, attacks aimed at the timing information will not work.

### Conclusion

We have developed an applied pi-calculus-based modeling framework for distance bounding protocols and attacks. We constructed a hierarchy of distance bounding attack scenarios and identified a new scenario for protocols that do not aim to protect against a compromised prover. We defined a compiler from our calculus to the applied pi-calculus and used it to analyze several distance bounding protocols, including those by MasterCard and NXP. We also demonstrated how the timing profiles used in these protocols can be verified.
