### 5. Analysis of Hidden Root and Leaf Certificates

**5.5 Problematic Implementation of Hidden Root Certificates**

Our analysis reveals that the implementation of most hidden root certificates is problematic, with over 87% violating at least one basic requirement of X.509 standards.

- **Error Messages from Zlint**: Out of 1.17 million hidden root certificates, Zlint reports 1,201,189 ERROR messages across 73 different lints.
- **Prevalence of Errors**: Over 87.3% of all hidden root certificates have at least one ERROR message, as shown in Table 5.
- **Performance by CA Type**: CAs from fake authentications exhibit the best average performance with 0.84 errors per root, while self-built CAs show the worst performance with an average of 3.25 errors per root.
- **Common Issues**: 
  - Missing critical extensions such as key identifiers, leading to certificate verification errors.
  - Invalid and vulnerable field values, such as negative serial numbers and weak public keys.
- **Warnings and Notices**: 10.9% of hidden root certificates only receive WARNING and NOTICE messages, indicating less severe but still flawed implementations [19, 33, 44].

**5.6 Problematic Implementation of Leaf Certificates Signed by Hidden CAs**

The implementation of leaf certificates signed by hidden CAs is even more concerning.

- **Error and Warning Messages**: On average, Zlint reports 8.14 ERROR and 1.93 WARNING messages for each leaf certificate.
- **Increased Vulnerability**: The ERROR messages in leaf certificates come from 114 lints, with a higher ratio (22.8%) of vulnerable fields compared to root certificates.
- **Weak RSA Keys**: A significant number of leaf certificates use weak 1024-bit RSA keys, which will be discussed in detail in Section 6.
- **Top Violators**: The top 10 groups with the highest average number of errors include 2 VPNs, 1 Proxy, 4 Enterprise CAs, 2 Government CAs, and 1 group of unknown category.
- **Correlation with Scale**: Figure 10 shows the correlation between the scale of leaf certificates signed by each hidden CA group and their error rates. 85 out of the top 100 groups sign every leaf certificate with implementation errors, while only 3 groups with a smaller scale have an error rate of less than 50%.

### 6. Validation Errors from Web Clients

**6.1 Higher Error Rates for Hidden CAs**

Web clients report more errors when encountering chains issued by hidden CAs compared to public CAs.

- **Overall Error Rate**: The daily ratio of invalid certificate chains is 3.59% for hidden CAs, compared to 0.55% for public trusted roots (Figure 11).
- **Blind Spots**: Several prevalent implementation flaws analyzed in Section 5 are not currently checked by clients, leaving users unaware of potential risks.
- **Reputation and Error Rates**: Chains issued by fake roots had the lowest invalid rate, while self-built CAs signing public websites presented the highest error rate (Table 2).

**6.2 Cryptographic Flaws in Hidden CAs**

Cryptographic flaws are the most serious errors reported by web clients for hidden CAs.

- **Common Errors**: The most frequent errors include WEAK_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM, COMMON_NAME_INVALID, AUTHORITY_INVALID, DATE_INVALID, and INVALID (Table 6).
- **Weak Algorithms and Keys**: Weak algorithms like SHA-1 and weak keys like 1024-bit RSA are still widely used (Tables 7 and 8).
- **Comparison with Public CAs**: A study in 2013 found that nearly 90% of leaf certificates signed by public trusted CAs already had a key strength of 2048-bit RSA or above [26].

### 7. Discussion

**Comparison with HTTPS Interception Studies**

While previous studies on HTTPS interception are relevant, our research scope is broader, covering traffic from hidden roots and other sources. Our findings provide a systematic evaluation of the impact on real-world clients and insights into the nature of the hidden root ecosystem.

**Distribution Channels of Hidden Root CAs**

- **Import and Pinning**: Hidden root certificates can be imported or pinned to local operating systems, but the exact distribution channels are not always clear.
- **Self-Built CAs**: Instructions for importing non-public certificates are often provided by websites using self-built root CAs.
- **Fake CAs**: Some fake CAs are associated with malware and may be maliciously installed to inspect secure connections.
- **Local Software**: Hidden roots can also be imported by local software such as VPNs and proxies.

**Recommendations**

- **Operating System**: Regulate root store modifications through compliance checks, monitoring, and explicit risk notifications.
- **Browser**: Enhance UI design and notification mechanisms to differentiate between public and hidden roots.
- **Application**: Standardize certificate implementation to provide precise subject information and normalize certificate content.

### 8. Conclusion

Hidden root CAs pose significant security risks to web clients, including HTTPS downgrade and TLS interception. Our study provides a comprehensive view of the large-scale impact of hidden root certificates, highlighting numerous implementation and operational flaws. We recommend stricter regulations and better user notifications to mitigate these risks.
