### Figure 4: Relative Size of Hitlist Components

- **Description:**
  - A block is chosen as the representative, independent of the prior census-based representative.
  - As inertia approaches 1, the chosen representative will never change.

- **Inertia in Production:**
  - For production hitlists, we use \( I = 0.34 \) based on score changes due to weighting (Section 4.1.1) and the following analysis.

### Inertia on Churn

- **Churn Definition:**
  - Churn is the rate at which representatives for established blocks are switched.

- **Table 6: Churn Analysis**
  - The table shows the amount of churn for four hitlists using the standard inertia \( I = 0.34 \).
  - In the HL32/16 column, about 7% of all predictions (306,588 representatives) changed relative to the prior hitlist (HL31/16).
  - The rate of churn is relatively stable over time, with 5–7% of all informed predictions changing each census.

- **Figure 5: Varying Inertia**
  - To estimate the relationship, we generate HL28/16 and modify it three times with censuses it29w, it30w, and it31w at different levels of inertia.
  - We then evaluate the hitlist against observations from census it32w.
  - Higher inertia suppresses churn, as it takes several new negative responses for a representative’s score to change.
  - Weight selection means the score can change by 0.3 from one new census and decrease to 0.5 from two new censuses.

### Figure 6: Effects of Different Inertia on Responsiveness

- **Process:**
  - HL28/16 is modified once by it29w, then tested against it30w.
  - Modified twice by it29w and it30w, then tested against it31w.
  - Modified three times by it29w through it31w and tested against it32w.

- **Observations:**
  - Responsiveness degrades slightly for high inertia values, from 59% responsiveness with no inertia to 53% when \( I = 0.8 \).
  - A moderate inertia has little effect on responsiveness, costing at most 6 percentage points even over eight months.

### 4.4 Effects of Probe Frequency

- **Census Frequency:**
  - Current censuses are taken every two to three months (Table 1).
  - More frequent sampling can provide better address responsiveness information.

- **Survey Data:**
  - Surveys probe 1% of the Internet every 11 minutes for two weeks.
  - We downsample this information to get observations every 12, 24, or 48 hours.

- **Table 7: Prediction Accuracy**
  - More frequent probing provides slightly better prediction (68% responsive from 12-hour samples vs. 66% for 48 hours).
  - Census-derived hitlists are more accurate than survey-derived hitlists by 2–4%.

### 4.5 Effects on Other Research

- **Responsiveness:**
  - Important for studies requiring end-to-end latency measurements.
  - Less critical for topology studies but may still benefit from it.

- **Edge Links:**
  - Responsive hitlists improve edge detection for 38% of blocks.
  - With 1.3 million allocated /24 blocks, responsive hitlists detect about 630,000 additional links compared to random hitlists.

- **ITDK Comparison:**
  - ITDK uses 42 cycles of data, each representing a traceroute to a randomly chosen representative.
  - Using our hitlist, we find about 1.7 million additional edges, 2.4× more than random probing.

### 4.6 Cost of Hitlist Generation

- **Census Cost:**
  - New censuses start every two to three months, requiring 12–15GB of archival storage.
  - Each census requires about 1–2GB of new positive observations.

- **Processing Cost:**
  - We maintain a master history file with bitmaps of all censuses, indexed by IP address.
  - Processing is parallelized using Hadoop, running over a cluster of about 40 computers with 120 CPU cores.
  - Joining a new census into an existing history takes about half an hour, and evaluating a new hitlist takes another half hour.

- **Table 8: Observations Summary**
  - We have data to make predictions for just under half of the blocks.
  - Random probing finds responsive addresses about 9% of the time.
  - Using our hitlist, we find about 1.7 million additional edges, 2.4× more than random probing.
