### 4.3 Packet Loss and Queue Management

#### 4.3.1 Do Broadband Links Experience High Packet Loss?

To investigate packet loss rates on broadband links, we used small-TCP trickle probe trains to measure the loss rates along the round-trip paths to remote broadband hosts. We sent widely spaced probes at a very low rate over a week and measured the fraction of probes for which the broadband hosts did not respond. This method captures losses on both the upstream and downstream paths and reflects the loss rate under normal network operating conditions. Note that the loss rates we measured might differ from those experienced by application traffic (e.g., TCP flows) that saturate the broadband links.

**Results:**
- **Low Packet Loss Rates:** Both cable and DSL networks exhibit remarkably low packet loss rates. For more than 95% of all DSL and cable paths, the loss rate is below 1%. Overall, the packet loss rates in broadband access networks are similar to those observed in academic network environments [11, 40].
- **Diurnal Patterns:** We also examined how loss rates varied over the course of a week. Figures 14 and 15 show our measurements for two typical providers: a DSL ISP (Ameritech) and a cable ISP (Chello). The horizontal axis represents local time, and the vertical axis shows the loss rate averaged over 120-minute intervals. We found that loss rates exhibit diurnal patterns with occasional spikes. Both ISPs follow similar diurnal patterns, with lower loss rates in the early morning and higher rates in the evening.

#### 4.3.2 Are ISPs Using Active Queue Management?

When packets are sent rapidly, they begin to fill up queues, and routers must eventually drop some of the packets. The most common queue management policy is tail-drop, where all packets arriving after the queue is full are discarded. More advanced policies, such as Random Early Detection (RED) [20], proactively drop packets using probabilistic schemes when the queue starts to fill but before it is full. While active queue management has been extensively studied, its deployment in practice is less well understood.

**Experiment:**
- **Methodology:** To infer whether broadband ISPs use active queue management, we used small-TCP floods to overflow both downstream and upstream links. We used IPIDs to distinguish between upstream and downstream losses [36]. For each successfully received response, we recorded the Round-Trip Time (RTT) and calculated the average loss rate over a sliding window of 40 packets. We then examined the correlation between the loss rates and the corresponding RTTs.
- **Inference:** A tail-drop policy results in a steep increase in loss rate when the queue is full (i.e., for a large RTT value). If an active queue management policy like RED is used, the loss rate will increase proportionally to the RTT after a certain threshold.

**Results:**
- **Tail-Drop vs. RED:** Figure 16 shows the relationship between loss rates and RTTs for two broadband hosts, one in PacBell and one in SWBell. For the PacBell host, the loss rate increases sharply around an RTT of 850 ms, suggesting the use of a tail-drop queue. In contrast, the SWBell host shows a different trend; after 500 ms, the loss rate increases almost linearly with the RTT before stabilizing at around 85%, indicating the use of RED.
- **Quantification:** To quantify the extent of RED deployment, we tested the correlation between RTT and loss rate increases. If the correlation coefficient is high (≥ 0.9) beyond a threshold loss rate of 5%, we concluded that the link may be using RED. We found that 26.2% of DSL hosts show a RED-style drop policy on their upstream queues. AT&T-owned providers (Ameritech, BellSouth, and PacBell) have deployment rates between 50.3% and 60.5%, while other DSL providers have rates below 23.0%. We did not detect RED in any of the cable ISPs measured.

### 4.4 Summary

We have provided an in-depth characterization of the properties of residential broadband networks, revealing important differences from academic networks and quantifying these differences. Our key findings include:

- **Allocated Link Bandwidths:** Downstream bandwidths exceed upstream bandwidths by more than a factor of 10 for some ISPs. Measured bandwidths generally match advertised rates, with little evidence of competing traffic affecting the links. Although link bandwidths remain stable over the long term, they show high short-term variation, especially for cable hosts.
- **Packet Latencies:** Many DSL hosts show large (≥ 10 ms) last-hop propagation delays. Cable hosts suffer higher jitter due to time-slotted packet transmission policies on their upstream links. Packet concatenation on upstream links can add another 5-10 ms of jitter in cable links.
- **Queue Sizes:** All ISPs deploy queues that are several times larger than their bandwidth-delay products. Downstream queues can delay packets by more than 100 ms, while upstream queuing delays can exceed several hundreds of milliseconds and, at times, a few seconds.
- **Packet Loss:** Both DSL and cable ISPs exhibit surprisingly low packet loss. Many DSL hosts use active queue management policies (e.g., RED) when dropping packets.

### 5. Implications of Our Findings

Our observations about broadband network characteristics can help researchers understand the performance of existing protocols and systems in the commercial Internet. These findings offer useful insights for the designers of future applications. Below, we briefly discuss the potential implications of our measurements for three popular Internet-scale systems:

- **Transport Control Protocols:** Our bandwidth and latency findings have several implications for transport protocol designs. For example, protocols like TCP Vegas [9] and PCP [3] use RTT measurements to detect incipient congestion. In the presence of high jitter, this mechanism might trigger congestion avoidance too early. Bandwidth-probing techniques, such as packet-pair [31], could return incorrect results in the presence of traffic shaping or packet concatenation, detrimental to protocols that rely on probing to adjust their transfer rates.
- **Network Coordinate and Location Systems:** Many IP-to-geolocation mapping tools [22, 52] use latency measurements to determine a host’s location. The large propagation delays and high jitter found in broadband networks can seriously interfere with the accuracy of these systems. Similarly, network coordinate systems [16, 37] use latency estimates to assign coordinates to participating hosts. Our measurements explain and provide insights into the poor performance of these systems in BitTorrent networks, where RTTs can vary by up to four orders of magnitude due to long queues and heavy traffic.
- **Interactive and Real-Time Applications:** The popularity of VoIP and online games has grown significantly. Our data shows that real-time applications will be negatively affected by the large queuing delays in broadband links. Queuing delays increase in the presence of competing traffic, leading to degraded service for time-sensitive applications when used concurrently with bandwidth-intensive applications like BitTorrent.

### 6. Related Work

There is a substantial body of previous measurement work characterizing Internet paths, but broadband access networks have received relatively little attention. Paxson [40] studied network packet dynamics among a fixed set of Internet hosts, primarily in academic institutions. More recent studies have examined the characteristics of the network paths connecting the PlanetLab testbed [5, 43].

- **Access Network Studies:** Claypool et al. [14] performed a measurement study of access network queue sizes using 47 volunteering broadband hosts, finding median queue sizes of 350 ms in DSL networks and 150 ms in cable networks. Jehaes et al. [30] observed large increases in round-trip delays over saturated broadband links, but their experiments were limited to one DSL and one cable link.
- **Residential Traffic Studies:** Some recent studies have examined the traffic generated by residential customers in Japan [12] and France [46], complementing our focus on network properties. Lakshminarayanan and Padmanabhan [32] performed a network measurement study from 25 broadband hosts, confirming some of our findings but at a smaller scale. Their later work [33] outlined pitfalls in measuring link capacities using existing tools, which our methodology avoids by relying on link saturation.
- **Peer-to-Peer Systems:** Many studies have measured network properties of hosts participating in file-sharing peer-to-peer systems [7, 44, 45], indirectly including measurements of broadband access networks. However, these studies focus primarily on application-level performance rather than link-level characteristics.

### 7. Conclusions

In this paper, we presented the first large-scale measurement study of major cable and DSL providers in North America and Europe. Our study characterized several important characteristics of broadband networks, including available link capacities, packet transmission policies, jitter, packet drop policies, and queue lengths. Our analysis revealed significant ways in which residential networks differ from conventional wisdom about the Internet. We also discussed the implications of our findings for emerging protocols and systems, such as delay-based congestion control (e.g., PCP) and network coordinate systems (e.g., Vivaldi).
