### Ethical Considerations in Research with At-Risk Users

Researchers must carefully plan and implement ethical methods when working with at-risk users. This is an emerging area of research, as highlighted by recent studies [23, 58].

### Technology Development for At-Risk Users

Technology creators can use the at-risk framework to better support a wide range of at-risk users in their products. However, it is crucial to consider at-risk users at scale. While our framework does not replace direct engagement with at-risk users, we advocate for such engagement when appropriate. Selective and ethical engagement is essential, especially given the open questions about ethical methods for at-risk user research (e.g., how to avoid overtaxing already stressed and resource-constrained groups). Many papers in our dataset recommend considering the impact of technology design on at-risk populations, which is incredibly important but challenging to scale without a guiding framework. Our framework simplifies this process by helping technology teams reason about balancing various risks and benefits.

### Balancing Usability and Options

In Section VI-C, we discussed the need for more nuanced digital safety options for at-risk users compared to typical users. Adding these options and transparency must be balanced with the real need for usability. At-risk users experience heightened stress due to the higher potential for digital harm and other risk factors such as resource constraints and marginalization.

To balance the need for options that address the unique needs of at-risk users with the high bar for usability, we encourage practitioners to make transparency and controls actionable and manageable. For example, transparency features that alert users to threats should provide clear next steps to fix the issue and guide them through relevant protective measures. Layered or directed designs can help users find the options and controls that best meet their needs. Additionally, easy-to-understand defaults that minimize barriers to deploying protections and are carefully selected to support at-risk users with many competing priorities (Section VI-A) are equally important.

### Conclusion

Over the past several years, a growing body of research has focused on digital-safety risks for at-risk users. However, guidance drawn from varied populations can be difficult for researchers and technology creators to apply in practice. To address this, we systematically analyzed 95 papers focused on varied populations and created an at-risk framework: 10 contextual risk factors that can augment or amplify common, high-priority digital-safety risks and their resulting harms, and the protective practices at-risk users employ to mitigate these risks. We used our framework to discuss the barriers at-risk users face in enacting digital protections. Moving forward, our framework can identify opportunities for future research and provide a structure for researchers and technology creators to ensure that everyone, including at-risk users, can engage safely online.
