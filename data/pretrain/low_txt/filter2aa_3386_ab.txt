### Most Known iCloud Hacks

**iCloud and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
- If enabled, 2FA is enforced for iCloud backups but not for files sideloaded to iCloud Drive or for iCloud-compatible app data.
- Overcoming 2FA is straightforward if the second authentication factor is available.
- Bypassing 2FA is possible if the binary authentication token is extracted from the user’s PC/Mac.

**Solution: Two-Step Verification?**

### What Google Knows About You

**Authentication Tokens in iCloud**
- Authentication tokens are used for convenience and are saved on a Mac or PC used to access iCloud.
- These tokens allow users to avoid entering their Apple ID and password every time.
- Technically, an authentication token is stored in a file on the user’s computer. Locating this file and extracting the token allows bypassing login/password authentication and 2FA.

**What Authentication Tokens Are Not**
- Authentication tokens do not contain the user’s password or a hash of the password.
- They cannot be used to brute-force the original plain-text password.
