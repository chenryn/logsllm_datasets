#### 1. Granularity and Accuracy of Diagnosis
Two primary reasons contribute to the effectiveness of our approach in achieving both high diagnosis granularity and accuracy.

**First**, it is well-known that many packet losses occur at the edge of networks, where paths typically consist of long, unbranched link chains. For instance, all paths originating from `planetlab1.cs.northwestern.edu` share the same initial five hops. When we use virtual links as the unit, the granularity is reduced to approximately 2.3 virtual links. This demonstrates that our LEND (Link End-to-End Network Diagnosis) approach can achieve a fine diagnosis granularity comparable to other more biased tomography methods while maintaining high accuracy.

**Second**, we observed that some lossy Minimal Identifiable Link Sequences (MILSs) are quite long, with some MILSs exceeding 10 hops in our experiments. Such long lossy MILSs are more common in smaller overlay networks where paths do not overlap. Figure 12 illustrates the distribution of the length of lossy MILSs in physical links at different times of the day (US Central Standard Time).

As discussed in Section VI-C6, we can apply the Gibbs sampling approach [5] based on the identified MILSs to obtain a lower bound on the diagnosis granularity, which is 1.9 physical links (or one virtual link). However, this comes at the cost of some accuracy, as detailed in Section VI-C6. By combining Gibbs sampling with our LEND system, we can flexibly balance granularity and accuracy.

#### 2. Accuracy Validation Results
We employed two validation schemes from Section V to validate our results: cross-validation and consistency checking using IP-spoof-based source routing.

**Cross Validation**: We divided the paths in the basis into two sets. The first set was used as input for the LEND system to generate MILSs and infer their loss rates. The second set was then used to test the inferred link loss rates. The fundamental idea is that if a path in the second set contains non-overlapping MILSs inferred from the first set, the loss rate of the path should be no less than the total loss rate of these MILSs, as the path may have additional lossy links not covered by the MILSs. Assuming the measured loss rate of the path is \( \hat{L} \) and the calculated loss rate of each MILS is \( L_i \), we check whether the following inequality holds:
\[ \hat{L} \geq \sum L_i + \epsilon \]
where \( \epsilon \) represents the tolerable error value. In our experiments, \( \epsilon \) was set to 0.5%. We performed cross-validation for each Internet experiment. Although the detailed numbers varied slightly across experiments, the cross-validation results were consistent. For example, in one experiment, we had 5720 paths, and we selected 2860 to identify 571 MILSs and infer their loss rates. We then validated these loss rates against the remaining 2860 paths. Of the 571 MILSs, 320 were on the paths of the second set and were verified by 2200 paths. The results showed that more than 99.0% of the paths in the second set were consistent with the MILSs computed from the first set, indicating accurate loss rate inference.

**IP-Spoof-Based Consistency Checking**: To further validate the results, we simultaneously started loss rate measurements and sent IP spoof packets. To minimize overhead, we intentionally selected spoofed IP addresses to infer only the path segments likely to be lossy based on previous experiments. Using the method introduced in Section V, we measured 1000 path segments. Similar to cross-validation, we applied the above inequality for matching validation. Out of 1664 lossy MILSs, 361 were on the 1000 new paths and thus validated. With the same parameter \( \epsilon \), 93.5% of the loss rates of the new spoofed paths were consistent with the loss rates of the MILSs. Note that changes in Internet routing can affect validation results, as a change in path routing may render the validation inapplicable. However, Internet routing is generally stable, and the IP-spoof-based consistency checking confirms the high accuracy of the MILS loss rate inference.

#### 3. MILS-to-AS Mapping
After identifying the lossy MILSs, we can locate and study the distribution of lossy links. Specifically, we aim to determine whether lossy links are typically within an AS or between two ASs.

To address this, we first need an accurate IP-to-AS mapping. A complete IP-to-AS mapping can be constructed from BGP routing tables by examining the last AS (the origin AS) in the AS path for each prefix. Mao et al. [27] demonstrated that an IP-to-AS mapping extracted from BGP tables can lead to accurate AS-level forwarding path identification with about 3% reassignment of the original IP-to-AS mapping. However, their available IP-to-AS mapping, obtained from 2003 measurements, is incomplete; we found that 1/4 of routers on our measurement paths were not mapped to any AS. Therefore, we derived the IP-to-AS mapping directly from BGP tables published in Route Views [28] on March 2, 2005. This mapping is highly complete, with only 1.6% of involved IPs (end-hosts and internal routers) unmapped to ASs.

Ignoring these unmapped nodes, we mapped MILSs to their AS sequences and analyzed the relationship between lossy links and ASs. Table VI shows the length of AS paths of the lossy MILSs. Since it is impossible to infer which specific link(s) are lossy in a long MILS, we focused on short MILSs with lengths of 1 or 2, which constitute about 44% of all lossy MILSs. It is evident that most lossy links connect two different ASs. For example, most length 1 MILSs (27.5% of all MILSs) connect two ASs. This observation aligns with the common belief that links connecting two ASs are more likely to be congested than those within an AS.

#### 4. Speed Results
The LEND system is highly efficient in our Internet experiments. After topology measurement, the average setup time (monitoring path selection, i.e., stage 1 in Figure 6) is 109.3 seconds, and the online diagnosis (stage 2 in Figure 6) of 3714 lossy paths out of a total of 18,090 paths takes only 4.2 seconds.

### Discussion

#### A. Link Properties for Diagnosis
This paper focuses on inferring link loss rates, but it is natural to question the applicability of the algorithms to other link properties. One challenge is that the linear algebraic model works only for additive metrics like loss rate and latency. Metrics such as link bandwidth and capacity are not additive and thus do not fit the linear algebraic model. Another challenge is that the good path algorithm will not work if the path properties are always positive, making our approach unsuitable for latency directly (in the directed graph model). However, latency can be decomposed into propagation delay, transmission delay, and queuing delay. In diagnosis, people often care about queuing delay, which is zero when network traffic is light and becomes large during congestion. Therefore, the good path algorithm may be applicable when most paths are over-provisioned, and queuing delay is negligible. Future work will involve conducting experiments to evaluate the applicability of our methods in this context.

#### B. Justifying the MILS Definition
In this section, we discuss alternative identifiable units for diagnosis. Currently, MILSs are defined with strong conditions:
- MILSs consist of consecutive sequences of links.
- Each MILS is a subpath of one end-to-end path.
- MILSs are minimal, meaning one MILS cannot be expressed as a sum of other MILSs.
- Each MILS is identifiable, meaning its properties can always be uniquely determined by end-to-end properties.

By defining MILSs this way, we ensure there are not too many of them: there may be at most \( n \) MILSs for each path of length \( n \), and due to path overlap, there will typically be far fewer than \( n \) MILSs overall. Requiring MILSs to be identifiable also ensures that we can efficiently compute their loss rates using Algorithm 1. However, it is possible to relax these conditions, and we consider the effects of more relaxed definitions below.

As shown in Theorem 1, these conditions are so stringent that, in a directed graph, the only MILSs are end-to-end paths. To localize physically lossy links, we used bounds on link loss rates at a finer granularity than the MILSs, obtained through the good path algorithm. With sufficiently tight bounds on a few physical links, we can get tight bounds on loss rates for link sequences shorter than end-to-end paths. This suggests that one could relax the definition of a MILS to allow some unidentifiable MILSs with loss rates that, though not uniquely identifiable, might still lie within a small interval. The drawback is that it is impossible to tell which unidentifiable link sequences might have tightly bounded loss rates from the topology alone.

As seen in the bottom example of Figure 3, MILSs can overlap. In this example, the sum of the loss rates on physical links 1 and 4 is uniquely determined by end-to-end measurements, but because these links are non-consecutive, we add link 3 to form the MILS. If we allowed non-consecutive link sequences to be MILSs, we could potentially get more detailed information. For example, if path \( P \) is lossy, we might be able to determine that the fault lies in link 3 rather than links 1 or 4. However, the number of possible non-consecutive link sequences grows exponentially with the path length, making it infeasible to test every sequence. While relaxing the requirement of continuity in MILSs seems beneficial, identifiable non-consecutive link sequences are rare in practice. We tested several topologies (synthetic and PlanetLab) and found only a small number of identifiable non-consecutive sequences, which can be ignored compared to the number of identifiable MILSs. Experimental results suggest that our MILS definition is efficient and represents the identifiable sequences in the paths.

### Conclusion
In this paper, we advocate a non-biased end-to-end network diagnosis paradigm that provides a smooth trade-off between accuracy and diagnosis granularity when combined with various statistical assumptions. We introduce the concept of minimal identifiable link sequences (MILSs) and propose the good path algorithms to leverage measurement snapshots for effective diagnosis in directed graphs. Both simulation and PlanetLab experiments show that we can achieve fine-grained diagnosis with high accuracy in near real-time. We also design a novel IP spoofing-based scheme to validate Internet experiments.
