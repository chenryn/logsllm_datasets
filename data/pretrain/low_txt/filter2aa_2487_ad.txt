### The Later Years of Project Blue Book and the Condon Committee

In its later years, Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official investigation into UFOs, was often accused of engaging in dubious research or even covering up evidence. Evidence suggests that some UFO reports bypassed Blue Book entirely, and the U.S. Air Force continued to collect and study UFO reports even after Blue Book was officially discontinued, contrary to their public claims.

### The Condon Committee

The Condon Committee, formally known as the University of Colorado UFO Project, was a comprehensive study of UFOs conducted from 1966 to 1968 under the direction of physicist Edward Condon. Initiated at the request of the U.S. Air Force, which had been studying UFOs since the 1940s, the committee examined hundreds of UFO files from Project Blue Book and civilian UFO groups. They selected 56 cases for detailed analysis, with the goal of resolving the "vexing problem" of UFOs that had plagued the Air Force for two decades.

The final report, titled "Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects" (commonly known as the Condon Report), was published in 1968. It concluded that no UFO reports were anomalous and that all UFO sightings had conventional explanations. The report also stated that further study of UFOs would not be worthwhile. This conclusion was generally welcomed by the scientific community and is often cited as a key factor in the subsequent decline of academic interest in UFOs.

However, the Condon Report has faced significant criticism. Some members of the committee and other critics have charged that the report was biased, unscientific, and shaped by the Air Force's expectations. For instance, astrophysicist Peter Sturrock noted that the report's conclusions were based on the presumption that the study was scientific, a claim disputed by several individuals, including physicist James E. McDonald and astronomer J. Allen Hynek.

One of the most glaring discrepancies in the Condon Report is that while it declared all UFO reports had prosaic explanations, it simultaneously classified 30% of the 56 case studies as "unknown." This percentage of unknowns was higher than in any previous Air Force UFO study. Additionally, some of the most puzzling cases, even after detailed analysis, were not mentioned in the report.

### Controversies and Infighting

The Condon Committee was also marked by internal conflicts and controversy. Of the sixteen original committee members, two were fired, one resigned in protest, and another stepped down due to unrelated legal troubles. According to Dr. Swords, at least twelve of the fifteen top staff members disagreed with Condon's methods, ideas, and conclusions. This infighting led to a high turnover rate among the staff.

On August 9, 1966, a memorandum written by Low, intended to persuade reluctant faculty members to participate in the UFO project, suggested that the study could be conducted in a way that appeared objective to the public but was actually designed to arrive at a predetermined conclusion. The memo stated that the study would be conducted by non-believers who would likely add substantial evidence that UFOs had no real basis. Low also suggested focusing more on the psychology and sociology of people who reported UFOs rather than on the physical reality of the sightings.

### Government and Intelligence Involvement

There have been suggestions that a continuing study of UFOs has been proposed several times within the government, involving relevant corporate, scientific, and intelligence professionals. The ability to keep secrets, as demonstrated in past events such as the presence of U-boats off the Atlantic Coast during World War II, supports the idea that such a study could be kept confidential.

### Deception and Ridicule

Deception and ridicule have been used to manage public perception of UFOs. For example, NASA responded to astronaut reports by calling them "bleary-eyed," and commercial pilots were accused of drinking. Fighter pilots feared they would not fly again if they reported UFOs. In the case of the JAL incident over Alaska, Richard Haines testified on behalf of a pilot who was quietly reinstated without a black mark after reporting an immense craft near Alaska.

### The Brookings Report

On December 14, 1960, the Brookings Research Institute released a report for NASA titled "Proposed Studies on the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs." This report discussed the potential effects of discovering extraterrestrial life, warning that such a discovery could have profound psychological impacts on society. The report also suggested that the better we understand these factors, the better prepared we may be.

### COMETA Report

In 1999, the COMETA report, a 90-page document prepared by a group of former auditors at the Institute of Advanced Studies for National Defense (IHEDN) in France, was published. The report emphasized the need for increased transparency and cooperation in the study of UFOs, particularly in terms of national defense. It recommended informing decision-makers, reinforcing investigation and study, and considering UFO detection in space surveillance.

### Incident at Exeter

A first-hand report from an NSA analyst whose son-in-law was stationed at the base during the Exeter incident revealed that the USAF issued a cover story. The analyst's son-in-law confirmed that there was no B-52 exercise that night, and when J. Allen Hynek investigated, officers at the base stated, "We just don’t know."

### Conclusion

If ongoing research on UFOs is being conducted, how would we know? Conversations with intelligence professionals and the symptoms of crossing the threshold suggest that the topic remains highly sensitive. Governments like those of Brazil, France, and Belgium have opened their UFO files and called for global collaboration, raising questions about why the U.S. government remains reluctant to do the same. What are the genuine security concerns, and why is it inappropriate to speak of the "government" as a single, unified entity in this context?
