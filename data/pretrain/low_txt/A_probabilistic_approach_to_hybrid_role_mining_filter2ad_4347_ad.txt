### Entropy and Mutual Information Analysis

If the entropy \( h(X_j) \) were higher, it would indicate a different distribution of permissions. For all permissions with high entropy, the mutual information between business information and permissions is also high (as seen by comparing the white and black bars in the lower three histograms of Figure 1).

### Comparison of Objective Functions

Figure 3 shows a direct comparison of the two objective functions: log-likelihood \( R(\text{ll}) \) and pairwise top-down costs \( R(S) \) for various values of the linear weight \( \lambda \). This suggests that knowledge of \( S \) might provide significant absolute information gain on permissions with low entropy, though this is not guaranteed.

### Organizational Unit and Job-Codes

Based on these findings, we conclude that for the enterprise under consideration, the organizational unit provides useful top-down information. The information provided by job-codes is already largely captured by the organizational unit, as evidenced by the minimal gain in mutual information when both are used together (see the two lower histograms in Figure 1). Therefore, it is reasonable to ignore job-codes and incorporate only the organizational unit into the role-mining process. In the next section, we will report on several experiments using both types of business information.

### Role Mining Experiments

#### 6.2 Role Mining Experiments

In this section, we evaluate our algorithm on real-world data. A good hybrid role mining solution should meet two criteria:
1. The role decomposition should capture most of the given user-permission assignment matrix without overfitting.
2. The user-role assignment should be easy to interpret from a business perspective.

To quantitatively assess a given role mining result, we introduce two measures: generalization ability and interpretability of an RBAC system.

##### Generalization Ability

We quantify the ability of a set of roles to generalize to new users to measure how well the underlying structure of a user-permission assignment matrix is captured. It is undesirable to redesign the set of roles for each new employee. Therefore, the existing set of roles should suffice to endow the new employee with all necessary permissions while adhering to the principle of least privilege, ensuring no extra permissions are granted.

A role set that does not generalize to new users must be adapted for each new employee, which is inefficient. We propose a two-step experiment to measure the generalization ability of a role mining algorithm:
1. The algorithm receives a subset of the user-permission assignments as input to find a role decomposition.
2. For each user from a second, disjoint subset, we use their business attribute (e.g., organizational unit) plus a small fraction of their permissions to identify the best-matching roles. From these roles, all other permissions of the user are predicted.

Since the second set of users comes from the same enterprise, a role mining solution that generalizes well should provide accurate predictions.

##### Implementation of the Experiment

From the entire user-permission assignment and business information, we randomly select 3000 users to infer a set of roles using our method described in Section 5.3. From the remaining users, we randomly choose a fraction \( \kappa \) of permissions (e.g., 10%). These permissions, along with the business information, are used to select the best-matching role set. Formally, we compute the total risk (Equation 12), where the log-likelihood costs (Equation 10) are summed only over the revealed permissions \( j_\kappa \). Each remaining user \( i \) is then assigned to the set of roles \( \hat{L}_i \) with minimal risk, i.e.,
\[
\hat{L}_i := \arg \min_{L \in L} R_{i,L}.
\]
The set of roles is then used to predict all permissions of user \( i \). Let \( \hat{z}_{i\cdot} \) be the assignment to the best-matching set of roles. The estimated permissions of user \( i \) are computed as
\[
\hat{x}_{i\cdot} = \hat{z}_{i\cdot} \otimes \hat{u},
\]
where \( \hat{u} \) is the role-permission relation found in the role mining step. Finally, the relative Hamming distance between the estimated and true permissions of user \( i \), \( \|\hat{x}_{i\cdot} - x_{i\cdot}\| / D \), i.e., the fraction of wrongly predicted permissions, is the measure for the generalization error of the inferred roles.

##### Interpretability

We formulate the second measure, the business relevance of the role assignments, by the conditional entropy of the role set \( L_i \) of a user \( i \), given his business information \( s_i \), i.e., \( h(L_i | s_i) \). This captures the requirement that all users with the same business attribute should obtain the same set of roles. Thus, the knowledge of the business attribute should ideally determine the roles an employee is assigned to. A set of roles, however, might be shared by users with different business attributes. This measure resembles the relevance analysis for business information introduced in Section 4, where we required that the given business information should have high mutual information with the permissions (recall \( I(X_j; S) = h(X_j) - h(X_j | S) \)) to agree with the permission structure and be useful for role mining. Following the same reasoning, we require roles to agree with the business information. Role decompositions that fulfill this requirement are easy to interpret from a business perspective.

### Experimental Results

#### 6.3 Experimental Results

We carried out hybrid role mining experiments for two different types of business information: organizational units and job-codes. Figure 4 plots the two described measures for both kinds of business information (OE left, JC right). For the OE-experiment, we directly compare these two measures, as displayed in Figure 5.

Figure 4 (left) compares, for different weighting factors \( \lambda \), the two measures on the role decompositions that were discovered. The case with \( \lambda = 0 \) corresponds to pure bottom-up role mining without business information. While the generalization error slightly increases with \( \lambda \), the mean conditional role set entropy given the business information decreases drastically if \( \lambda \) is increased from zero to a small value. Hence, the correspondence between the user-role assignment and the users’ organizational unit substantially improves as business information is taken into account. Even for small values of \( \lambda \), the roles can be better interpreted as business roles. Since this gain in the business meaning of the user-role assignment comes at the expense of only a small decrease in the generalization ability of the roles, it is a price worth paying. For \( \lambda > 0.04 \), the entropy \( h(L_i | s_i) \) does not substantially further improve, whereas the prediction error rises. In this interval, the two parts of our objective function are antagonistic, and hence a further increase of \( \lambda \) is not desirable.

The right part of Figure 4 displays the results obtained by using the job-codes as business information. To compare the two experiments, Figure 4 shows both results for axes with the same scale. Note that the two trends of the conditioned role entropy (blue diamonds) cannot be directly compared since they are computed with respect to the two different types of business information. However, one can reason about the generalization error, which is in both cases computed with respect to the same user-permission assignment. While for the job-codes (right graph) the generalization error converges exponentially to the maximum with increasing \( \lambda \), for the organizational units, it converges only linearly. For low \( \lambda \), it is possible to substantially improve the interpretability of the role decomposition while preserving good generalization ability.

For hybrid role mining with job-codes, this is not possible. The generalization ability increases immediately for even small \( \lambda \). This result confirms the findings of our analysis of these two types of business information carried out in Section 6.1. The job-codes do not agree as well with the direct user-permission assignment as the organizational units do. Hence, using job-codes, it is only possible to trade off generalization ability for business interpretability. However, with organization units, one can improve the business interpretability without substantially increasing the generalization error.

Figure 5 directly compares the two quality measures for different values of \( \lambda \) in the experiment with the organizational units. The graph shows that it is possible to improve the results of role mining by using our unified objective function to incorporate business information into the role mining process: Changing \( \lambda \) along the straighter parts of the curve gives improved solutions, whereas the more curved parts mark the solutions that are Pareto-optimal with respect to the two measures. In a concrete application, the trade-off between generalization and interpretability must be chosen such that the side conditions are met. For example, one might require that no more than some given percentage of permissions of a new employee are wrongly predicted by the solution. Viewed more generally, optimizing generalization performance and interpretability is a multi-objective optimization problem.

### Conclusion

We have divided the hybrid role mining problem into two parts and provided solutions for them: determining the relevance of business information for role mining and incorporating this information into a hybrid role mining algorithm. We solved the first problem with an entropy-based measure of relevance and the second by deriving an objective function that combines a probabilistic model of RBAC with business information.

To validate our solutions, we carried out experiments using actual enterprise data. The results show that our approach finds roles with the following properties: they generalize well, they are easy to interpret (i.e., intuitively understandable) from the business perspective, and they have high predictability in that they approximate closely the given user-permission assignment. All of these properties are desirable as they have direct, positive consequences for the administration and maintenance of RBAC-based systems. Generalization facilitates the maintenance of RBAC since new users can be easily equipped with needed permissions without creating new roles. Interpretable roles simplify both the role’s life-cycle management and adding new users to the system. Finally, predictability leads to increased security, as predictive roles implement closely the authorization policy given by the original user-permission assignment.

As future work, we will investigate an adaptive weighting scheme of the business information. Not every value of a business attribute might be equally descriptive for the permissions received by a user with this attribute. Adaptive weighting might enable an even more adaptive inclusion of specific business attributes. Furthermore, we will explore extensions of our approach for analyzing and merging two given RBAC systems while preserving their inherent business semantic. The quantitative methods of our approach could also be a starting point to learn about the relationship between the access control data and the business structure of both domains.
