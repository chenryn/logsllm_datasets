**Recommendations:**
- Modify Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to define shorter session timeouts and set a maximum duration for any single session.
- Configure GPOs to specify the maximum amount of time that a disconnected session can remain active on the Remote Desktop (RD) session host server. [61]

This approach ensures that sessions are terminated in a timely manner, reducing the window of opportunity for unauthorized access.
