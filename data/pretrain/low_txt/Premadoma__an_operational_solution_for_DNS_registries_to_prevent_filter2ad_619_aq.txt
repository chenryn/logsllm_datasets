### Discussion

The referenced studies were evaluated on different datasets and top-level domains (TLDs). This variability suggests that future work could explore the consistency and generalizability of these findings across different TLDs.

In line with our research goals, several studies aim to reduce the time required to stop abuse by identifying related malicious domains. Felegyhazi et al. [5] explored the feasibility of proactive domain blacklisting by inferring other malicious registrations from known-bad domains through shared name servers and identical registration times. Premadoma leverages this concept of facilitators in a more generic way as part of its reputation-based classification, applying this approach to prevent abuse at the registration stage.

Many studies focus on DNS traffic from newly registered domains to detect malicious behavior [1–3, 8, 17, 23, 24]. For example, Xu et al. [24] use passive DNS data to predict malicious behavior, while Weber et al. [23] evaluated various clustering techniques for identifying malicious domain campaigns. These systems generally concentrate on operational DNS patterns, whereas Premadoma intervenes at an earlier stage, before the domain is in use. A recent study by Vissers et al. [21] found that approximately 20% of domain registrations by malicious actors are not detected by blacklists. This highlights the importance of alternative methods to blacklisting and explains the sometimes higher than expected false positive rates, as a significant fraction of false positives are actually true positives that did not end up on blacklists.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced Premadoma, a system designed for DNS registries to predict malicious domain registrations at the time of registration. This system takes a novel approach by focusing on recurring patterns in registrant information and targeting commonly used registration facilitators. By using this method, Premadoma significantly reduces the success rate of malicious registrations and facilitator reuse, thereby hindering the sustainability of large-scale malicious campaigns. We thoroughly evaluated the performance and adaptability of the proposed prediction model over an 11-month testing period, addressing complex and domain-specific dataset challenges, such as incomplete blacklist coverage. Since its successful deployment at the .eu ccTLD registry, Premadoma has contributed to the takedown of 58,966 malicious registrations and has led to a notable decline in malicious domain registrations.
