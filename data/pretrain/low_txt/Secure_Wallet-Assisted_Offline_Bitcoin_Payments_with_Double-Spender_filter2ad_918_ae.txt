### 8. Related Work

Bitcoin was first introduced in [49], and since then, it has been extensively analyzed with respect to security, privacy, and other aspects. A comprehensive technical survey on decentralized digital currencies, including Bitcoin, is available in [54]. Systematization of knowledge in this domain is provided by [22].

Hashrate-based double-spending attacks, initially discussed in [49], were further analyzed in detail in [52]. The first comprehensive study on Bitcoin, presented in [20], covered various aspects such as deflation due to the capped amount of bitcoins, forking the chain, malware attacks, and scalability. The Bitcoin protocol was modeled in [48], demonstrating that it achieves Byzantine consensus. The core of the Bitcoin protocol was analyzed in [36], where it was proven secure if the network is tightly synchronized and the adversary's hashing power is strictly less than 50%. However, the adversarial bound decreases as synchronization becomes looser.

Essential aspects of network synchronization and information propagation were studied in [31, 33]. Eclipse attacks on the Bitcoin network, which allow attackers to perform n-confirmation double-spending attacks, selfish mining, and facilitate adversarial forks in the blockchain, were demonstrated in [41].

Works most closely related to our interest are [42] and [17], which analyzed double-spending attacks in the context of fast payments and suggested countermeasures. However, these approaches rely on online detection of double-spending transactions, making them unsuitable for offline payment scenarios. Other solutions, such as OtherCoin [34], TREZOR [50], and BlueWallet [18], use secure hardware to protect Bitcoin signing keys. These solutions primarily aim to protect private keys from malware or other attempts to extract them, whereas our goal is to limit access of bitcoin owners to their signing keys to prevent double-spending.

CoinBlesk [11] is a mobile Bitcoin payment solution suitable for fast payments. Similar to our solution, transactions in CoinBlesk are performed directly from the payer to the payee (over NFC). However, at least one party must be online during the transaction, which does not address the problem we aim to solve. Additionally, the concept of duplex micropayment channels, initially introduced in the context of Bitcoin contracts [4], was adapted in [32] for off-blockchain payments to minimize the number of transactions confirmed by the network. This solution can be used for offline payments but only when the payer and payee know each other in advance.

Finally, the Green Addresses solution [8] addresses the "confirmation delay" problem by introducing a trusted third party, facilitating assured, zero-confirmation transactions. While this shows that trusted third parties can be accepted in the Bitcoin ecosystem, it does not solve the problem of offline payments.

### 9. Conclusion

In this work, we aimed to address the challenge of secure Bitcoin payments in scenarios where parties have no online connection during the payment, or where the connection is available but purchased items are released immediately after the payment, before the transaction is confirmed by the Bitcoin network. Our solution relies on an offline wallet residing on the payer's platform. Such a wallet can be implemented in different ways, such as using secure hardware or a deposit system. In this paper, we focused on the secure hardware approach, proposing new security mechanisms, providing rigorous analysis, and demonstrating how they can be integrated into payment processes.

As a proof of concept, we prototyped our solution for Android clients and used a JavaCard to host an offline wallet. Our implementation shows that smooth integration over a prevalent platform like Android is feasible, and that offline and online payments can co-exist. We also discussed a second deployment approach, outlining how the offline wallet could be instantiated using a wallet deposit system managed by the Bitcoin network itself, without relying on external third parties.
