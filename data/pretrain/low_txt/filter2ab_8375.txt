**Title: Botconf 2018 - Red Teamer 2.0: Automating the Command and Control (C&C) Setup Process**

This presentation builds upon the comprehensive documentation provided by Steve Borosh (@424f424f) and Jeff Dimmock (@bluscreenofjeff) in their dedicated repository. It also draws from several real-world red team operations that have successfully implemented the tips and techniques shared by these authors.

During the talk, we will introduce a new open-source tool, which will be revealed during the presentation. This tool is designed to streamline and automate the setup of Command and Control (C&C) infrastructure for red team operations, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness.
