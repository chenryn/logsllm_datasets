### Appendix B: Open Directory Password Server Authentication Methods

#### WebDAV-Digest Password Validation
WebDAV-Digest is responsible for handling Digest-MD5 password validation for the WebDAV protocol, which is used to authenticate access to an iDisk. It is essential to keep WebDAV-Digest enabled to allow users to mount iDisks and other WebDAV servers in the Finder. 

When passwords are transmitted over the network, WebDAV-Digest encodes them, and they are stored in a scrambled form on the server. This method ensures good security during network transmission. However, a malicious user with access to the server could potentially decode the password file, although this would be extremely difficult.

### Appendix C: Authentication Manager

Mac OS X Server supports users configured to use the legacy Authentication Manager technology from Mac OS X Server versions 10.0 to 10.2. 

**Authentication Manager** is a legacy technology designed for securely validating passwords for the following types of users:
- Users of Windows services (including support for SMB-NT, SMB-LM, and CRAM-MD5)
- Users of Apple file service whose Mac OS 8 computers have not been upgraded with AFP client software version 3.8.3 or later
- Users who need to authenticate for mail services using APOP or CRAM-MD5

**Key Points:**
- **Compatibility:** Authentication Manager works only with user accounts created in a NetInfo domain of Mac OS X Server versions 10.0 to 10.2.
- **Enabling:** The NetInfo domain must have Authentication Manager enabled.
- **Upgrade Considerations:** When upgrading a server to Mac OS X Server version 10.3 from an earlier version with Authentication Manager enabled, it remains enabled. Existing users can continue to use their same passwords.
- **Transition to Open Directory:** After upgrading to Mac OS X Server version 10.3, you can change existing user accounts to authenticate using Open Directory. Open Directory authentication is preferred for Windows services and is required for domain login from a Windows workstation to a Mac OS X Server primary domain controller. New user accounts created in Mac OS X Server version 10.3 are set to use Open Directory authentication by default.

### Glossary

- **Active Directory:** The directory service of Microsoft Windows 2000 and 2003 servers.
- **Administrator:** A user with server or directory domain administration privileges. Administrators are always members of the predefined “admin” group.
- **Administrator Computer:** A Mac OS X computer with the server administration applications installed from the Mac OS X Server Admin CD.
- **AFP (Apple Filing Protocol):** A client-server protocol used by Apple file service on Macintosh-compatible computers to share files and network services. AFP uses TCP/IP and other protocols to communicate between computers on a network.
- **Authentication:** The process of verifying a user’s identity, typically by validating a username and password. Authentication usually precedes authorization, which determines the user’s level of access to a resource.
- **Authentication Authority Attribute:** A value that identifies the password validation scheme specified for a user and provides additional required information.
- **Authorization:** The process by which a service determines whether to grant a user access to a resource and the extent of that access. Authorization follows authentication.
- **BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution):** A version of UNIX on which Mac OS X software is based.
- **Child:** A computer that receives configuration information from the shared directory domain of a parent.
- **Class:** See object class.
- **Computer Account:** A list of computers with the same preference settings and available to the same users and groups.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** A protocol used to distribute IP addresses to client computers. Each time a client starts up, it requests an IP address from a DHCP server, which assigns an available IP address along with a lease period.
- **Directory Domain:** A specialized database storing authoritative information about users and network resources, optimized for handling many requests and retrieving information quickly.
- **Directory Domain Hierarchy:** An organizational structure for local and shared directory domains, with a root domain at the top and local domains at the bottom.
- **Directory Node:** See directory domain.
- **Directory Services:** Services providing uniform access to directory domains and other sources of information about users and resources.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** A protocol allowing computers to transfer files over a network. FTP clients can connect to a file server and download files based on their access privileges.
- **Group:** A collection of users with similar needs, simplifying the administration of shared resources.
- **Group Directory:** A directory organizing documents and applications of special interest to group members, allowing them to exchange information.
- **Guest User:** A user who can log in to a server without a username or password.
- **Hash:** An encrypted form of a password or other text.
- **Home Directory:** A folder for a user’s personal use, also used by Mac OS X to store system preferences and managed user settings.
- **IP (Internet Protocol):** Also known as IPv4, a method used with Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to send data between computers over a local network or the Internet.
- **IP Address:** A unique numeric address identifying a computer on the Internet.
- **Kerberos:** A secure network authentication system using tickets issued for a specific user, service, and period. Once authenticated, users can access additional services without re-entering their password (single sign-on).
- **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol):** A standard client-server protocol for accessing a directory domain.
- **Local Domain:** A directory domain accessible only by the computer on which it resides.
- **Long Name:** See username.
- **Mac OS X:** The latest version of the Apple operating system, combining the reliability of UNIX with the ease of use of Macintosh.
- **Mac OS X Server:** An industrial-strength server platform supporting Mac, Windows, UNIX, and Linux clients, providing scalable workgroup and network services plus advanced remote management tools.
- **Managed Client:** A user, group, or computer whose access privileges and preferences are under administrative control.
- **Managed Preferences:** System or application preferences under administrative control, manageable via Workgroup Manager and Macintosh Manager.
- **NetInfo:** One of the Apple protocols for accessing a directory domain.
- **Object Class:** A set of rules defining similar objects in a directory domain by specifying required and optional attributes.
- **Open Directory:** The Apple directory services architecture, which can access authoritative information about users and network resources from various directory domains, BSD configuration files, and network services.
- **Open Source:** A term for the cooperative development of software by the Internet community, involving many people in writing and debugging code by publishing the source code.
- **Owner:** The person who created a file or folder and has the ability to assign access privileges for other users. The owner automatically has read/write privileges and can transfer ownership.
- **Parent:** A computer whose shared directory domain provides configuration information to another computer.
- **Primary Group:** A user’s default group, used by the file system when a user accesses a file they do not own.
- **Primary Group ID:** A unique number identifying a primary group.
- **Protocol:** A set of rules determining how data is sent between two applications.
- **Rendezvous:** A protocol developed by Apple for automatic discovery of computers, devices, and services on IP networks, sometimes referred to as “ZeroConf” or “multicast DNS.”
- **Schema:** The collection of attributes and record types or classes providing a blueprint for the information in a directory domain.
- **Search Policy:** A list of directory domains searched by a Mac OS X computer when it needs configuration information, and the order in which they are searched.
- **Share Point:** A folder, hard disk (or partition), or CD accessible over the network, shared using AFP, Windows SMB, NFS, or FTP protocols.
- **Short Name:** An abbreviated name for a user, used by Mac OS X for home directories, authentication, and email addresses.
- **Single Sign-On:** An authentication strategy relieving users from entering a name and password separately for every network service. Mac OS X Server uses Kerberos to enable single sign-on.
- **SLP (Service Location Protocol) DA (Directory Agent):** A protocol registering services available on a network and providing easy access to them. SLP/DA uses a centralized repository for registered network services.
- **SMB (Server Message Block):** A protocol allowing client computers to access files and network services, used over TCP/IP, the Internet, and other network protocols.
- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer):** An Internet protocol allowing encrypted, authenticated information to be sent across the Internet.
- **Username:** The long name for a user, sometimes referred to as the user’s “real” name. See also short name.
- **WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning):** A live authoring environment allowing client users to check out web pages, make changes, and check them back in while a site is running.
- **WebDAV Realm:** A region of a website, usually a folder or directory, defined to provide access for WebDAV users and groups.
