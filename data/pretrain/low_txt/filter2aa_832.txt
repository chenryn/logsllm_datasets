# Privacy in DSRC-Connected Vehicles

## Defcon 21 â€“ August 3, 2013

### About the Speaker
- **Background:**
  - Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) with a focus on digital communications.
  - Extensive experience as a network engineer.
  - Current law student at Santa Clara University.
  - Research assistant providing technical expertise on privacy audits and reviews.
  - Contracted by an automotive consortium to review the privacy aspects of a proposed vehicle-to-vehicle safety network.

### Standard Disclaimer
- I am not a lawyer (yet).
- If you know anyone looking for summer interns, please let me know.

### Non-Standard Disclaimer
- A current NDA covers some of my work, but this presentation will focus on published information and standards.

## Project Overview

### What is This Project?
- **DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communications):** 
  - Communication range: approximately 380 meters.
  - Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication.
  - Potential benefits:
    - Reduced waiting times at traffic lights on empty streets.
    - Improved traffic planning for better cities and roadways.

### Why is It Being Developed?
- **Safety:**
  - The World Health Organization estimates that 25% of vehicle deaths each year can be prevented.
  - Reduction in accidents caused by fatigue, distracted driving, blind corners, fog, and limited visibility.

### Current Status
- **Deployment:**
  - Hardware is already being shipped.
  - Software issues are still under development.
  - The U.S. Department of Transportation is considering mandating DSRC for all new cars (decision pending).
  - Already deployed in trucks in Europe.

## Technical Details

### What is DSRC?
- **Basic Safety Messages:**
  - Sent every 0.1 seconds.
  - Include predefined vehicle trajectory and operational data.
  - Cars process this data and warn drivers.
  - Equipment is integrated into vehicles.

### Aftermarket Installation
- **Challenges:**
  - Can be cumbersome.

### What DSRC is Not
- **Not CANbus or OnStar:**
  - Does not directly support autonomous driving mechanisms.

### Radio Protocol
- **Frequency:**
  - 5.9 GHz reserved in the U.S. and Europe.
  - Signaling standard: IEEE 802.11p, 1609.4, 1609.3.
  - Channels reserved for specific functions.
  - No source address required for vehicles.
  - Recommendations include using certificates.
  - Privacy challenges at each layer.

### Basic Safety Message
- **Standard: SAE J2735**
  - ~50 fixed data elements.
  - Only interface to radio on this channel/band.

### Parameters for Effectiveness
- **Density:**
  - Greater usage leads to greater effectiveness.
- **Confidence:**
  - Most messages must be trustworthy.

### Validity
- **Cryptographic Security:**
  - All messages are cryptographically signed.
  - Signing certificates issued by a central authority.
  - Issued based on system fingerprint.
  - Revocation for malfunctioning equipment.
  - System should invalidate itself if internal checks fail.

### Proposed PKI Approach to Communications Security
- **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure):**
  - Limited time use to prevent tracking.
  - Periodically refreshed (and malefactors reported).
  - Identity/validity conflict.
  - Solution: constantly changing certificates.
  - Revocation by fingerprint.
  - Issuing authority?

### Fingerprints
- **No Correspondence:**
  - Between fingerprint and car.
  - Hard-coded into the device.
  - If revoked, the entire unit must be replaced to function.

### Certificate Delivery
- **Delivery Methods:**
  - Cellular, Wi-Fi, infrastructure links.
  - Many opportunities for failure.

### Worrisome Noise
- **Commercial Use:**
  - Manufacturers want to use the system for commercial apps.
  - Advertising and other funding schemes to pay for CA.
  - Fixed infrastructure potentially operated by data brokers.

### Law Enforcement Concerns
- **Potential Issues:**
  - Correlate location, speed to independent identification (e.g., cameras).

## What You Can Do
- **Technical Engagement:**
  - Hack the radios (commercially available now).
  - Hack the protocols.
- **Political Engagement:**
  - Most decisions are not made by elected officials.
  - Help find a way to fund the infrastructure without selling out!
