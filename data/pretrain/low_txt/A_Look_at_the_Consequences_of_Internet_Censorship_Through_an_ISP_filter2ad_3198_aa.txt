## Abstract

Internet censorship alters the dynamics of resource production and consumption, impacting various stakeholders, including end users, service providers, and content providers. This study examines two large-scale censorship events in Pakistan: the blocking of pornographic content in 2011 and the blocking of YouTube in 2012. Using traffic datasets collected from home and SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) networks before and after these events, we:

- Quantify the demand for blocked content.
- Highlight the challenges faced by service providers in implementing censorship policies.
- Investigate changes in user behavior, such as circumvention techniques, post-censorship.
- Assess the benefits gained by competing content providers due to the blocking of specific content.

## 1. Introduction

Nation-level internet censorship affects the activities of hundreds of millions of users globally, with many countries implementing it for various reasons. While previous studies have analyzed the deployment and technology of censorship, there is a lack of understanding regarding its consequences. How does censorship impact different stakeholders? What actions do users, content providers, and ISPs take in response to censorship? How effectively does censorship achieve its goals, and what are the collateral damages?

This work aims to provide quantified insights into the impact of censorship on users, content providers, and ISPs, using traffic datasets captured at a medium-sized ISP in a major city in Pakistan. Pakistan is an ideal case study, having recently implemented two significant instances of censorship: blocking pornographic content in 2011 and blocking YouTube in 2012.

Our dataset includes six residential and SOHO traffic traces collected before and after these censorship events, with one dataset collected on the day YouTube was blocked. Trace durations range from 6 to 16 hours, capturing 200-500GB of traffic from 100-1,000 local IP addresses. We also conducted a survey of about 700 Pakistani internet users to supplement our analysis.

Key findings include:

- A sudden increase in SSL traffic on the day YouTube was blocked, attributed to users switching to VPNs to circumvent the censors. This change persisted a year later.
- SOHO users quickly identified effective circumvention techniques, primarily switching to SSL within hours of the content being blocked.
- Competing alternatives to YouTube saw a significant increase (≈ 40–80%) in traffic volume, while blocked sites dropped considerably in search-engine page rankings.
- Before censorship, porn content made up 10% of home and SOHO traffic. Post-censorship, this fraction reduced, even after factoring in traffic shifted to alternative unblocked porn websites and increased SSL (potentially VPN) traffic.
- The YouTube block had two significant, unintended consequences: (i) financial impact on the ISP due to increased bandwidth requirements from upstream providers, and (ii) financial impact on YouTube, with user demand halving in terms of video requests observed in unencrypted traffic.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Internet Infrastructure and Censorship in Pakistan

Our study spans data collected at a Pakistani ISP between 2011 and 2013, a period during which the country's censorship policy evolved. There are approximately 50 local and regional ISPs in Pakistan, with only two, PTCL and TWA, having direct international connectivity. These ISPs sell their services to other providers and directly to consumers. Most CDN servers are located outside Pakistan, and censorship typically targets content hosted abroad.

Censorship directives originate from the government or judiciary and are implemented by the regulator, PTA. In 2011, Pakistan began a more persistent blocking policy with the censorship of pornographic content, followed by the blocking of YouTube in 2012. The porn block was in response to a media report highlighting Pakistan as the top country for searches related to porn, while the YouTube ban was due to a video deemed blasphemous. Currently, the country continues to block access to YouTube and sites deemed pornographic, anti-religious, or a threat to national values and security.

### 2.2 Determining the Implementation of Censorship

Previous studies have focused on inferring technologies for implementing censorship, often using active probing to detect manipulation of traffic by intermediate devices. These studies help validate our findings, but we cannot directly map them to our three-year dataset because censorship mechanisms can vary over time and across different vantage points. We employ passive analysis of each data trace to identify the censorship mechanisms in effect at a given time.

### 2.3 Consequences of Internet Censorship

Previous literature has examined how network-level events, particularly in the context of anti-piracy laws, affect user and content provider behavior. Studies have also assessed the unintended impacts of internet censorship on global internet services. For example, China's injection of forged DNS responses has caused large-scale collateral damage by blocking outside traffic that traverses Chinese links. Upstream filtering can block traffic from outside a censored region due to ISP routing arrangements. Our study leverages an ISP viewpoint to investigate the consequences of internet censorship on users, content providers, and operators, a perspective not previously studied.

## 3. Data Sources for the Study

### 3.1 Capture Location and ISP Overview

Our tier-2 Pakistani ISP peers with a tier-1 provider through the Transworld Associates TWA-1 submarine telecommunications cable in Karachi. The ISP serves both residential and SOHO customers. Due to confidentiality, we cannot provide details about the scale of operations, customer base, or address space used. Figure 2 shows the data capture location within the ISP premises, where all customer lines terminate at one of several BRASes. Each BRAS connects to the ISP’s core Internet-facing router through a switch, and the ISP gathered the traces at the BRAS-facing side of this switch, capturing all local ISP-generated traffic and bi-directional traffic going in and out.

### 3.2 Data Description

Table 1 summarizes the six network traces captured between 2011 and 2013, providing pre- and post-censorship snapshots of activity. Capture durations range from 6 to 16 hours, with sizes between 200-500GB, comprising traffic from 100-1,000 IP addresses. Some IP addresses likely reflect NATs, so the actual user population could be larger. Due to variables in the traces, cross-trace trends may not exclusively be attributed to censorship but could arise from disparate capture days and timings. However, some results are sharp enough to indicate responses to censorship.

### 3.3 Data Sanitization and Characterization

For sound analysis, we first identify measurement ambiguities and inaccuracies (sanitization) and then label the data (characterization) to extract relevant portions. Data can include inaccuracies due to various reasons, such as limitations of the capturing device or analysis tool. We remove connections that did not fully establish, based on Bro’s connection state field, reducing our datasets to roughly half the original number of connections. We label flows based on connection direction and type of local addresses, using subsets appropriate for specific analyses.

We supplement this data with a user survey conducted in the region to explore user behavior post-YouTube censorship. The survey results help shape the scope of our YouTube censorship analysis and provide additional perspectives for our findings.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Data Collection

The primary data consists of six network traces captured at a Pakistani ISP between 2011 and 2013. The traces were collected before and after the censorship events, providing a comprehensive view of the impact of censorship on internet traffic.

### 4.2 Data Analysis

We use protocol logs generated using Bro, including connection, HTTP, and DNS logs. The connection log contains one entry per flow, while the protocol logs contain separate entries for each request-response pair. We analyze the number of connections (distinct transport-layer flows) and the number of requests (individual request-response pairs).

### 4.3 Ethical Standards

The authors with direct access to the data signed a contract highlighting the obligations to respect user privacy, not share data with third parties, not move data outside Pakistan, and undertake an objective study without maligning any party involved in the censorship landscape.

## 5. Results and Discussion

### 5.1 Demand for Blocked Content

We quantify the demand for blocked content by analyzing the traffic patterns before and after the censorship events. For example, before the porn block, porn content made up 10% of home and SOHO traffic. Post-censorship, this fraction reduced, even after accounting for traffic shifted to alternative unblocked porn websites and increased SSL (potentially VPN) traffic.

### 5.2 Challenges for Service Providers

Service providers face significant challenges in implementing censorship policies, including technical difficulties and the need to balance compliance with user expectations. We highlight these challenges and discuss the methods used to implement and enforce censorship.

### 5.3 Changes in User Behavior

Users quickly adapted to the censorship by adopting circumvention techniques. For instance, on the day YouTube was blocked, there was a sudden increase in SSL traffic, attributed to users switching to VPNs. This change persisted a year later, indicating a long-term shift in user behavior.

### 5.4 Benefits for Competing Content Providers

Competing alternatives to YouTube saw a significant increase (≈ 40–80%) in traffic volume, while blocked sites dropped considerably in search-engine page rankings. This change represents a marked regional shift in the economics of video content distributors, who mainly rely on ad revenue.

### 5.5 Unintended Consequences

The YouTube block had two significant, unintended consequences: (i) financial impact on the ISP due to increased bandwidth requirements from upstream providers, and (ii) financial impact on YouTube, with user demand halving in terms of video requests observed in unencrypted traffic.

## 6. Conclusion

This study provides a detailed analysis of the consequences of internet censorship in Pakistan, focusing on the impact on users, content providers, and ISPs. By leveraging traffic datasets and a user survey, we offer quantified insights into the effects of censorship, including changes in user behavior, challenges for service providers, and the economic implications for content providers. Our findings highlight the complex and far-reaching consequences of internet censorship, providing valuable information for policymakers and stakeholders.
