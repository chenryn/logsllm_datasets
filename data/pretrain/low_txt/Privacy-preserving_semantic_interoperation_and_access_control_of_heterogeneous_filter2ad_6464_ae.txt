### Related Work
- **RBAC-based Information Sharing**: De Capitani di Vimercati and Samarati have shown how authorization specification and enforcement can be implemented in federated database systems [9]. Dawson, Qian, and Samarati discuss how security can be provided while enabling interoperation of heterogeneous systems [8], but their system does not preserve the privacy and confidentiality of metadata from information sources.
- **Querying Encrypted Databases**: Substantial work has been done on querying databases with encrypted data [13]. These approaches tackle data inference attacks, while PACT addresses metadata inference attacks. PACT can be integrated with a database containing encrypted data to enable interoperation with minor modifications.
- **Semantic Access Control**: Qin and Atluri introduced concept-level semantic access control for the Semantic Web [17]. Qu et al. [18] presented an ontology-based rights expression language built on OWL. Damiani et al. [7] discussed extending policy languages for the Semantic Web. Agarwal and Sprick [2, 3], and Yague and Troya [21, 20] have presented frameworks for access control policies for Semantic Web services.

### Conclusion
In this work, we present PACT, a novel mediation-based solution that provides maximum privacy and confidentiality for metadata, queries, and data while enabling interoperation among heterogeneous databases. PACT incurs only a minor performance degradation compared to existing interoperation systems.
