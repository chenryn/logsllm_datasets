### Configuration and Troubleshooting for IBM MQ

#### System Configuration
- **Operating System Configuration**: Ensure that the configuration is appropriate for your operating system, as settings may vary.
- **Resource Limits**: Review your OS manuals (e.g., the man page for `pthread_create`) for detailed information on resource issues and tuning. Confirm that resource limits are properly configured.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Check if the system is running short of resources, including both memory and CPU.

#### Unexpected Process Termination and Queue Manager Crash
- **Process Ending Unexpectedly Followed by FDCs from amqzxma0**
  - **Example FDC**:
    - **Date/Time**: Mon May 02 2016 01:00:58 CEST
    - **Host Name**: test.ibm.com
    - **LVLS**: 8.0.0.4
    - **Product Long Name**: IBM MQ for Linux (x86-64 platform)
    - **Probe ID**: XC723010
    - **Component**: xprChildTermHandler
    - **Build Date**: Oct 17 2015
    - **Build Level**: p800-004-151017
    - **Program Name**: amqzxma0
    - **Addressing mode**: 64-bit
    - **Major Errorcode**: xecP_E_USER_TERM
    - **Minor Errorcode**: OK
    - **Probe Description**: AMQ6125: An internal IBM MQ error has occurred.

- **Possible Causes and Solutions**:
  - **User-Initiated Process Termination**: Check if any user has ended a process.
  - **Memory Exception**: Verify if the IBM MQ process ended due to a memory exception. Look for an FDC with Component: xehExceptionHandler and apply fixes for known issues.
  - **High Memory Usage**: Check if the operating system terminated the process due to high memory usage. Review the OS log for OOM-killer events.

#### User Limits and Resource Configuration
- **User Limits**: The user limits used by the process might differ from the configured limits. Ensure the correct user starts the queue manager and set the appropriate resource limits for this user.

#### Troubleshooting on Windows
- **Initial Checks**:
  - **Identify Characteristics of the Problem**:
    - Has IBM MQ run successfully before?
    - Have any changes been made since the last successful run?
    - Have you applied any maintenance updates?
    - Has the application run successfully before?
    - Are you receiving errors when using special characters in descriptive text for some commands?
    - Are there any error messages or return codes to help determine the problem's location and cause?
    - Can you reproduce the problem?
    - Does the problem affect specific parts of the network?
    - Does the problem occur at specific times of the day?
    - Is the problem intermittent?

  - **Investigate Potential Problems with Applications, Commands, and Messages**:
    - Are messages failing to arrive on the queue?
    - Do messages contain unexpected or corrupted information?
    - Are unexpected messages received when using distributed queues?
    - Have you received no response from a PCF command?
    - Are only some of your queues failing?
    - Does the problem affect only remote queues?
    - Are you receiving an error code when creating or starting a queue manager on Windows?
    - Is your application or system running slowly?
