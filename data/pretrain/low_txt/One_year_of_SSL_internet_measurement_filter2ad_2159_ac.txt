### Results Consistency with Extensions and SSLv2 Compatibility

The results remain largely consistent even when extensions are sent or when a ClientHello message compatible with SSLv2 is used. However, it is concerning that many servers still do not use TLSv1.0 and instead opt for the outdated SSLv3. While the situation is better for trusted and Extended Validation (EV) hosts, such configurations should be avoided. For the SSL2+ stimulus, this includes 32,000 servers out of 4 million trusted servers and approximately 1,000 servers out of 140,000 EV hosts.

### Interpretation of Other Stimuli

Interpreting the other stimuli is more challenging. As shown in Table 3, the DHE, EC, SSL2, and TLS12 stimuli result in fewer TLS responses. This indicates that some servers refuse to negotiate certain protocol versions or cipher suites. Some of these servers will send an alert in compliance with standards, while others may not respond or return inconsistent TLS messages, a phenomenon we term "intolerance" to specific versions or suites. This issue is further discussed in Section 6.

### Ciphersuite Distribution

Table 5 presents the distribution of ciphersuites chosen by servers across different campaigns and subsets. The ciphersuites are categorized as Strong (S), Acceptable (A), Weak (W), and Not Proposed (N).

For the first three campaigns (NoExt1, EFF-1, and EFF-2), about 65% of the responses contain strong ciphersuites. For trusted or EV subsets, this proportion is lower, primarily because the A category includes the popular but only acceptable TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 suite. For the NoExt2, FF, and SSL2+ campaigns from July 2011, the proportions are roughly 72% for TLS hosts, 68% for trusted hosts, and 80% for EV hosts, indicating a minor improvement in ciphersuite choices, especially for EV hosts.

We observed that some servers responded with ciphersuites not proposed in the ClientHello, which is non-compliant with specifications. This was significant in the DHE and EC campaigns, where servers had limited choices. We also saw this behavior with the TLS12 stimulus, mainly because we did not propose the popular RC4_MD5 ciphersuite. This reflects server intolerance to DHE, EC, and TLSv1.2.

### Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)

Table 6 shows the proportion of ciphersuites providing Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). PFS ensures that past sessions cannot be decrypted if the server's private key is compromised. Around 40% of TLS hosts chose PFS ciphersuites, with slightly higher figures for trusted hosts and lower for EV hosts, particularly in July 2011, where only 11% of EV hosts chose PFS.

### Secure Renegotiation

As discussed in Section 4.2, we expect servers to implement RFC 5746 for secure TLS renegotiations. However, only three out of ten stimuli (FF, SSL2+, and TLS12) proposed this extension in July 2011. Consequently, we can only assess the support for this feature at that time. Among the TLS hosts, 53% accepted the RFC 5746 extension, increasing to 65% for trusted hosts and 80% for EV hosts. Nevertheless, 20% of EV hosts (approximately 28,000 servers) still did not support secure renegotiation as of July 2011.

### Analysis of Server Behavior

#### Comparing Data Over Time

Comparing data collected at different times proved irrelevant due to the instability of IP addresses over months or years. For instance, comparing our July 2010 measure with the EFF's August 2010 measure, 7.5 million IPs were common, but 2 million were unique to our trace, and nearly 4 million were unique to the EFF trace. This instability is even more pronounced when comparing measures from 2010 and 2011, with only 5.5 million IPs consistently representing TLS hosts.

#### Error Margin for July 2011 Campaigns

For the seven simultaneous July 2011 campaigns, we found that 99.6% of IPs corresponding to a TLS host in one measure also did so in another. The correlation was even stronger for trusted or EV hosts. Additionally, over 99.6% of IPs presented the same server certificate each time they responded with a valid ServerHello, with 99.9% of trusted and EV hosts serving only one certificate. The 0.4% of hosts that did not consistently send the same server certificate define our error margin.

#### Understanding Hosts with Multiple Stimuli

To refine statistics on DHE/EC/TLSv1.2 intolerance, we focused on servers that correctly responded with a compatible ServerHello to the NoExt2, FF, and SSL2+ stimuli. This yielded 11.2 million TLS hosts, 4.0 million trusted hosts, and 141,972 EV hosts. Tables 7, 8, and 9 present the responses to the DHE, EC, and TLS12 stimuli, partitioned into the categories defined in Section 3.4.
