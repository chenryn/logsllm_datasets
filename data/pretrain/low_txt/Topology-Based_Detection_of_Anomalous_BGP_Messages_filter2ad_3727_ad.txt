The installation of such connections is a relatively infrequent event. Therefore, we do not expect a noticeable influence on the number of false alerts. This assessment was confirmed by our measurements, as shown in Section 6.2. Note that we did not manually change any of these 'anomalies' for the evaluation of the detection process, but we expect them to contribute to the observed false alarms.

### 6.2 Detection Evaluation

The detection approach was evaluated using BGP data collected during four different weeks over the last two years. We used the first day of each week to build our models and the subsequent six days as input to the detection algorithms.

The first two data sets are crucial for assessing the detection capability of our system, as both contain significant misconfiguration problems. 

- **First Data Set (April 5, 2001)**
  - Incident: Cable and Wireless (AS3561) propagated more than 5000 improper route announcements from one of its downstream customers [7, 18], which illegitimately claimed large IP ranges.
  - Impact: Global connectivity problems for about 90 minutes.
  - Expected Detection: IP address ownership violations.

- **Second Data Set (January 10, 2002)**
  - Incident: A customer propagated routes received from its upstream provider to a peering partner [18]. The peer then forwarded the routes to its own upstream provider, advertising routes to parts of the Internet through the customer AS itself.
  - Similarity: This misconfiguration is similar to an attack where a periphery AS announces a route to other periphery ASes through itself.
  - Expected Detection: Invalid AS paths.

The third and fourth data sets, after reviewing the mailing list of the North American Network Operators’ Group [25] for the periods in question, are free of major attacks or misconfigurations. These two weeks serve as more recent data to verify the validity of our assumptions about the AS connectivity graph and to provide an estimate of the false positive rate for the current Internet.

### Table 2: Alert Overview

| Week Starting At       | Update Messages | Address Violation | Correct | Incorrect | Invalid AS Path | Incorrect |
|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Apr. 5th, 2001         | 1,507,673       | 2148              | 0       | 76        | 0               | 0         |
| Jan. 10th, 2002        | 5,918,085       | 0                 | 18      | 23        | 0               | 0         |
| Sep. 15th, 2002        | 7,065,598       | 0                 | 23      | 14        | 0               | 0         |
| Mar. 3rd, 2003         | 5,499,401       | 0                 | 0       | 0         | 0               | 0         |

For each data set (collected over six days), the table shows the total number of processed update messages, the number of IP address ownership violations, and the number of invalid AS paths reported. All alerts are classified as either correct or incorrect. An alert is classified as correct when it is clearly related to one of the two incidents in the first two data sets. All other alerts are classified as incorrect. Closer examination of the incorrect alerts reveals that a large percentage is due to the misclassification of periphery nodes that are actually part of the core. Such misclassifications occur mainly for autonomous systems located in Asia or Eastern Europe. The update messages collected from Route View mostly contain traffic sent between ASes in Europe and the US, resulting in an AS connectivity graph that is sparse for other regions. As the node classification relies on the degree of connectivity, core nodes in those regions may not have enough neighbors in our graph and are thus labeled as periphery. To obtain more precise data from these regions, we would require BGP data from routers located there. Other incorrect alerts might be the result of actual misconfigurations, but no supporting evidence was found for the relevant dates on the network operator mailing list [25], and the alerts had to be classified as incorrect. Another possible cause is the use of invalid data to create the network topology model.

Note that the numbers in Table 2 reflect unique violations. When multiple invalid update messages with identical routing information are observed, only one alert is produced. This highlights the potential tremendous impact of a single misconfiguration on the global infrastructure. For example, the 2148 different address ownership violations detected during one day of the first test week were the result of a single incident.

It is interesting to observe that the properties of the network graph and the behavior of the system do not change noticeably for the test sets that reflect samples from a period of over two years. This indicates that our assumptions are stable and that detection can be performed reliably.

### 7. Future Work

This section outlines our plans to extend the security model and the presented technique.

- **Inclusion of BGP Policies**: BGP speakers usually define policies that restrict the information exchange with their respective neighbors and influence routing decisions. This allows us to determine whether the current network graph conforms to the specified policies and raise an alarm in case of a deviation. Such deviations could result from misconfigurations or malicious behavior.
- **Automatic Consideration of Changes**: The current design does not automatically take into account changes in IP address ownership and the removal of connections between autonomous systems. It would be desirable to determine when IP address blocks have been transferred between ASes without the intervention of an operator who has to remove the binding from the database. This could be done by including information from the Route Arbiter Project [29] or from various network information centers.
- **Utilization of Withdrawal Messages**: The information in withdrawal messages is currently not utilized. This is because it is not straightforward to extract topology information from such updates.

### 8. Conclusion

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the de facto standard for inter-domain routing in today’s Internet. Although protocol design weaknesses and implementation flaws in many devices running BGP are well-known, it is difficult to overcome them. The huge base of installed equipment and the fact that, despite several successful attacks, global routing seems to work satisfactorily, create an enormous reluctance to adopt newer protocols. Although approaches such as S-BGP seem appealing at first glance, they have not been widely deployed. In the meantime, the concept of "security by obscurity" is the only protection against potentially devastating attacks.

We have developed a technique to validate routing data in BGP UPDATE messages to protect routers from installing falsified routes. The mechanism is based on topology information of the autonomous systems connectivity graph and geographical data from WHOIS databases. It is capable of identifying updates where a malicious or misconfigured router announces illegitimate IP address blocks or invalid routes that do not exist. Our system can be applied immediately and does not interfere with the existing infrastructure.
