# Transportation and Privacy Concerns

## Auto Registration
- **License Plate Mapping**: Services like LexisNexis can easily map a license plate to a physical address and owner. Consider this when your vehicle is up for renewal. (Note: Title 18, Part I, Chapter 123, Section 2721 prohibits the disclosure of such information.)
- **Traffic Incidents**: If you cut someone off in traffic, they may attempt to find you. Where might they look?
- **Parking**: To maintain privacy, consider parking in a garage whenever possible.

## Auto Insurance
- **Requirements**: All states and D.C. require auto insurance.
- **Cost and Privacy**: Besides the cost, there are privacy reasons to avoid owning a car. Insurers need detailed information about you and your vehicle, including where it will be parked at night.
- **False Information**: Submitting false information on an insurance application can lead to severe consequences, such as denial of claims. Are you prepared to never make a claim?

### Auto Insurance Solutions
- **Self-Insurance**: Can you self-insure by posting a high-dollar bond? Weigh the financial risk against the privacy benefits.
- **LLC Ownership**: If the car is owned by an LLC, can the LLC obtain insurance for the car?
