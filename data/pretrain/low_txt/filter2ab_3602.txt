**ATT&CK ID:** T0802  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Automated Collection

Adversaries may automate the collection of information from industrial environments by using tools or scripts. This automated collection often leverages native control protocols and tools available within the control systems environment. For example, the OPC (OLE for Process Control) protocol can be used to enumerate and gather information. Gaining access to a system or interface that supports these native protocols may enable adversaries to collect and enumerate other connected servers and devices, thereby expanding their reach and understanding of the target environment.
