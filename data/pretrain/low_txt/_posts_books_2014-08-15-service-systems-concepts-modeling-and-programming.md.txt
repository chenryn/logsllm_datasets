**Authors:** Jorge Cardoso, Ant√≥nia Lopes, and Geert Poels  
**Publisher:** Springer (2014)

This SpringerBrief provides an in-depth exploration of the internal workings of service systems. The authors introduce a lightweight semantic model designed to effectively capture the essence of service systems. Key topics covered include:

- **Modeling Frameworks:** Techniques and tools for creating comprehensive models.
- **Service Descriptions and Linked Data:** Methods for describing and linking services to enhance interoperability.
- **Creating Service Instances:** Practical approaches for implementing and managing service instances.
- **Tool Support:** Overview of available tools to support the development and management of service systems.
- **Enterprise Applications:** Real-world applications of service system modeling in various business contexts.

Previous literature on service system modeling has primarily focused on an external perspective, describing how systems can be integrated. This brief, however, introduces the concept of white-box service system modeling. This approach emphasizes the internal aspects and elements of service systems, providing detailed descriptions that can be used for service management, optimization, and analytics.

**Target Audience:**
- Researchers and academics interested in the emerging field of service science.
- Educators looking to incorporate the latest developments in service systems into their curricula.
- Advanced-level students who want to gain a deeper understanding of service systems.
- Information Systems (IS) and Information Technology (IT) practitioners seeking better ways to describe, model, and communicate services.

**Availability:**
This book is available for purchase at [Springer.com](http://www.springer.com/computer/database+management+%26+information+retrieval/book/978-3-319-10812-4 "Title").
