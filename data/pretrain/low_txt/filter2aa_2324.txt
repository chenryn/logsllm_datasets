### Foxy P2P Software

**Overview:**
- Foxy is a popular Chinese P2P software in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
- It is based on the Gnutella and G2 architecture.

**Data Leakage:**
- Data can leak into the Foxy P2P network even if you do not have Foxy installed.
- Different clients with varying user interfaces can join the same P2P network, potentially leading to data exposure.

**Security Concerns:**
- **ADSL Dial ID/Password:** Sensitive information such as ADSL dial IDs and passwords can be exposed.
- **Sharing Nodes:** These nodes are not easily visible, and files are shared immediately after downloading.
- **Limited Software Functionality:** Only Foxy can join the Foxy network, but other clients can still interact with it.

**Foxy Connection Process:**
1. **Connect to Foxy**
2. **Search from Foxy**
3. **Download from Foxy**

**GWebCaches:**
- Used for caching and optimizing search queries within the Gnutella network.

**Gnutella Protocol Example:**
- **GNUTELLA CONNECT/0.6**

  - Uses custom Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) and Base64 algorithm.
  - Foxy operates as a closed Gnutella P2P network.

**Network Topology:**
- **Ultrapeers (Hubs):** Maintain an aggregate of their leaf's Query Hash Tables (QHTs) and their own QHT.
- **Leaves:** Connect to multiple hubs and participate in the network.
- **Decentralized, 2-tier Architecture:** Recommended for Gnutella v0.6.
  - New nodes connect to known hubs.
  - Hubs typically accept 300-500 leaves and connect to 5-30 other hubs.
  - Leaves typically connect to 3 hubs.

**Query Handling:**
- Queries are forwarded to ultrapeers, who check their aggregate QHTs for matches.
- If a match is found, the query is forwarded to the appropriate leaf; otherwise, it is forwarded to neighboring ultrapeers by flooding.

**Reach Calculation:**
- Assuming each peer connects to an average of 5 other peers and has a TTL of 7, the reach can be calculated as 20,480 other peers.
- The reach is determined by the number of connections (n) and the Time-to-Live (TTL).
