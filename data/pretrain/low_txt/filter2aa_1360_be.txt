### Chapter 10: Social Networks: Facebook

#### Introduction
To use the search tool effectively, you must enable pop-ups in your browser. You can also utilize any of the previously discussed search operators, including quotation marks. At the end of most chapters, I provide a similar search tool that summarizes and simplifies the query processes for the techniques explained. I encourage you to become familiar with these tools. Once proficient, you can query target data across all options within a few minutes, saving several hours each week.

#### Official Facebook Search Options
**2022 Update:**
Over the past year, many search methods have disappeared, reappeared, and disappeared again. Be aware that some of the techniques described here may no longer work by the time you read this.

#### Timeline of Facebook Search Changes
- **June 17, 2019:** Various researchers developed online search tools and browser extensions that restored most of the Facebook Graph functionality. Hundreds of OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) researchers adopted these tools, restoring many of our missing techniques.
- **August 1, 2019:** All browser-based extensions leveraging the Facebook Graph stopped working due to new encryption implemented by Facebook.
- **September 8, 2019:** Methods such as using the Facebook Messenger application to search telephone numbers and most email search options disappeared. This appeared to be a deliberate move by Facebook to lock down the platform.
- **August 2, 2019:** The Facebook username to user ID conversion tool on my website stopped working. It appeared that my web server was being blocked by Facebook. After switching to a new web server, the tool began functioning again.

#### Current State of Facebook Search
I am hesitant to write extensively about Facebook search techniques, as many valuable methods disappeared in 2019. However, there are still several methods we can apply, although the future outlook for targeted queries is uncertain. Before diving into the details, let's review the recent Facebook search timeline:

- **2020:** Facebook drastically changed their layout, removed the wildcard (*) search operator, blocked some "base64" methods, and continued to aggressively monitor the OSINT community's response to their actions.

#### Facebook's Redesign and New Search Options
Facebook's 2020 redesign introduced many new search options beneficial to online investigators. Once logged in, a simple search field will appear at the top of any Facebook page. I encourage you to think of Facebook's current search landscape in two parts:
- **Keyword Search:** Any generic term, name, location, or entity of interest.
- **Filter Search:** Options that eliminate unwanted results.

#### Example: Finding a Profile
Let's start with a demonstration where we are looking for a profile of a person named Tom Johnson, who lives in Chicago, Illinois, attended Vashon High School, and currently works at Foot Locker. Figure 10.01 shows a Facebook keyword search with filters applied, which located only one result, thanks to the targeted query.

**Figure 10.01: A Facebook keyword search with filters applied.**

#### Navigating Facebook Profiles
Once a user's profile is located, the default view is the "timeline" tab, which includes basic information such as gender, location, family members, friends, relationship status, interests, education, and work background. Clicking through this data may uncover valuable evidence, but you may miss other data. I will explain numerous methods throughout this chapter to help identify all available content relevant to your investigation.

#### Using Traditional Filter Options
Consider using the traditional filter options available on most Facebook pages. Figure 10.02 displays the main filter bar on every Facebook profile page, which allows you to seek Photos, Videos, Places, Groups, and other options associated with the profile.

**Figure 10.02: Facebook's main filter options.**

#### Direct URL Queries
Assume your target is Mark Zuckerberg. His profile is available at the following URL: `https://www.facebook.com/zuck`. Typing in a target's real name should lead to results, many of which are unrelated to your investigation. Unlike other social networks, Facebook users typically use their real name when creating a profile. With billions of active users, it is likely that you will locate several user profiles under the same name as your target.

**Direct URLs for Mark Zuckerberg's Profile:**

#### Conducting Keyword Searches
Letâ€™s conduct another keyword search within the official site. Assume you wanted to find any posts including the term "OSINT". After conducting the basic search, scroll to the end of the limited results and click "See all public posts for OSINT". This expands the search and opens the Posts filter options. From there, you can filter by year or location. You could also click through the other categories such as Videos or Groups.

**Direct URLs for OSINT Search:**
- All: `https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=osint`
- Posts: `https://www.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=osint`
- People: `https://www.facebook.com/search/people/?q=osint`
- Photos: `https://www.facebook.com/search/photos/?q=osint`
- Videos: `https://www.facebook.com/search/videos/?q=osint`
- Marketplace: `https://www.facebook.com/search/marketplace/?q=osint`
- Pages: `https://www.facebook.com/search/pages/?q=osint`
- Places: `https://www.facebook.com/search/places/?q=osint`
- Groups: `https://www.facebook.com/search/groups/?q=osint`
- Apps: `https://www.facebook.com/search/apps/?q=osint`
- Events: `https://www.facebook.com/search/events/?q=osint`
- Links: `https://www.facebook.com/search/links/?q=osint`

#### Advanced Search Techniques
In order to conduct detailed searches, you must know the user number of your target. This unique identifier allows you to search otherwise hidden information from Facebook. Prior to mid-2015, the easiest way to identify the user number was through the Graph API. However, this no longer works because Facebook removed the ability to search their Graph API by username. We can still obtain this number through a manual search option.

**Example:**
- User ID: 4
- URL: `https://facebook.com/search/4/photos-by`

#### Base64 Encoding
This technique involves viewing the source code of any user's Facebook profile. In Firefox and Chrome, right-click on a Facebook profile page and select "View Page Source". Within the browser, conduct a search on this page for "userID". If you are exhausted from searching within each profile's source code, three sites that currently attempt to automatically replicate this process are:
- `https://fb-search.com/find-my-facebook-id`
- `https://findidfb.com/`

**Base64 Encoding Example:**
- Desired text data: `{"rp_author":"{\"name\":\"author\",\"args\":\"[USERID]\"}"}`
- Base64 Encoded: `eyJycF9hdXRob3IiOiJ7XCJuYW1lXCI6XCJhdXRob3JcIixcImFyZ3NcIjpcIjRcInOifQ==`

**URL Breakdown:**
- `https://facebook.com/` - The Facebook domain
- `search/` - Instructs Facebook to conduct a search
- `photos/` - Specifies the type of information desired
- `?q=photos` - Searches any photos (videos and posts also work)
- `&epa=FILTERS&filters=` - Finishes the URL with a filter demand

#### Conclusion
At this point, you should be able to locate a target's profile by name with filters, analyze publicly available content, and search by topic. That is just the tip of the iceberg. Facebook collects a lot of additional information from everyone's activity on the social network. Every time someone "Likes" something or is tagged in a photo, Facebook stores that information. Extracting these details can be difficult, but the techniques and tools provided in this chapter will simplify the process.
