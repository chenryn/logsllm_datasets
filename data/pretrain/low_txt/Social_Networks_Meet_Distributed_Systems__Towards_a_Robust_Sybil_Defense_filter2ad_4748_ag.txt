### User Session and Messaging Dynamics in P2P Systems

**Session Duration:**
- **Observation:** Users are typically seen in 10 or more time intervals, indicating that most user sessions last less than an hour.
- **Comparison:** These session durations are consistent with those observed in other peer-to-peer (P2P) systems [26].

**Messaging Activity:**
- **Figure 3(d):** This figure illustrates the distribution of the number of messages sent by each user relative to their online time over a 24-hour period. Only users who have sent at least one message are included, which accounts for approximately 3% of all users.
- **Trend Analysis:**
  - The median number of messages sent by a user increases with the number of hours they are online.
  - After 14-15 hours, the number of messages plateaus.
  - Users who are online for more than 18 hours tend to send fewer messages, possibly because they keep their clients running continuously but only occasionally engage in chat.

**Figures:**
- **(a) Online Concurrency:** Shows the number of users online at any given time.
- **(b) Online > 1 Hour:** Displays the number of users who remain online for more than one hour.
- **(c) Online Distribution:** Illustrates the distribution of user online times.
- **(d) Messaging Activity:** Depicts the relationship between the number of messages sent and the duration of online time.

**Yahoo! Instant Messenger (YIM) Communication Patterns:**
- **Dataset Overview:**
  - Captures the communication patterns among 100,000 users across 5,649 zip codes from April 1 to 28, 2008.
  - Logs the first daily communication between two users from unique locales: (u1, z1, u2, z2, t), where u1 is the sender, z1 is the sender's zip code, u2 is the receiver, z2 is the receiver's zip code, and t is the time of the message.
  - Subsequent messages within the same day and locale are not logged unless there is a change in the zip code of either the sender or the receiver.

**User Activity and Friendships:**
- **Figure 4 (left):** Heat map showing the minimum number of messages sent by a user versus the number of their friends. The more friends a user has, the more messages they tend to send.
- **Figure 4 (right):** Heat map illustrating the number of unique days on which a user sent at least one message versus the number of their friends. Users with more friends are active on more days.

### Summary of Findings and Implications

- **Online Presence:**
  - In both Skype and YIM, the percentage of users online during a 24-hour period peaks at 15-25% during the daytime and drops to 5-10% during late night.
  - This indicates that only a small fraction of users are online at any given time, and the online pattern follows a non-stationary distribution.

- **Session Length:**
  - Approximately 50% of YIM users are online for less than one hour, and 90% for less than five hours in a day, suggesting that most users have short online sessions.

- **Continuous Online Presence:**
  - About 30-45% of YIM users are online across consecutive hours throughout the day, indicating a significant portion of users can be leveraged even in dynamic environments.

- **Correlation Between Friends, Online Time, and Activity:**
  - Users with more friends spend more time online and send more messages, highlighting a strong correlation between the number of friends, online time, and activity.

### Problem Formulation

In this section, we reformulate the problem addressed in previous decentralized social network-based Sybil defense (SNSD) schemes, such as SybilLimit [31], Gatekeeper [27], and X-Vine [21], by incorporating churn as a major design factor. Our model is informed by the measurements of Skype and YIM discussed in the previous section.
