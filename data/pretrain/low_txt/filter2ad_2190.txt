## Abstract
The 6th Workshop on Encrypted Computing and Applied Homomorphic Cryptography (WAHC’18) was held in Toronto, ON, Canada, on October 19, 2018, co-located with the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). The workshop aimed to bring together professionals, researchers, and practitioners from academia, industry, and government, focusing on practical applications of homomorphic encryption, encrypted computing, functional encryption, secure function evaluation, private information retrieval, and searchable encryption. The event featured six talks on various aspects of secure computation and provided a forum for discussing current and future challenges.

## 1. Introduction
In an era where geographical distance no longer hinders collaboration, secure computation has become a critical feature of modern and future information systems. Distributed network applications and cloud architectures are vulnerable due to the aggregation of vast amounts of personal data in various formats and for multiple purposes. Industries and consumer electronics companies face significant threats such as intellectual property theft and industrial espionage. Public infrastructure must be protected against sabotage and manipulation. Encrypted computing offers a solution by enabling data processing on remote, potentially insecure resources while keeping both program code and data encrypted. This allows the outsourcing of confidential information independently of the trustworthiness or security level of the remote system.

## 2. Scope and Topics of Interest
The workshop aims to convene researchers, practitioners, industry, and government representatives to present, discuss, and share the latest advancements in the field. We seek to exchange ideas that address real-world problems with practical approaches and solutions. The workshop is typically well-attended by participants from academia, government, and industry, including both experienced attendees and newcomers. Specific technologies include homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation, which need to interoperate with existing technologies and infrastructures. The topics covered include:

- Software architectures for encrypted applications
- Platform and system integration for encrypted applications
- Algorithmic primitives for encrypted applications
- Hybrid (partly encrypted) applications
- Hardware implementations of encrypted computing
- Implementation of homomorphic encryption schemes
- Practical performance evaluations of homomorphic encryption schemes
- Practical aspects of functional encryption
- Privacy-preserving set operations
- Secure information sharing
- Circuit transformation of algorithms
- Obfuscation techniques
- Encrypted search schemes
- Encrypted e-payment solutions
- Encrypted financial transactions
- Encrypted applications in bioinformatics

### 3.5 3rd HomomorphicEncryption.org Standards Meeting
Based on the success of two previous standards meetings and the founding of the HomomorphicEncryption.org industry consortium, the Third Standardization Workshop was held at the University of Toronto on October 20, 2018. The meeting, closely related to WAHC but with its own program, focused on developing a standard API for homomorphic encryption.
