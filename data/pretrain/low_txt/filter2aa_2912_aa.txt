## Motivation
The 4G standard introduces numerous new technologies, including VoLTE and SON, to provide modern services to customers. Base stations, which are the large and small antennas in the field, play a crucial role in this ecosystem. Our research aims to bring visibility to:
- How the 4G environment operates
- The practices of service providers and vendors

## Introduction
From 2G to 4G: An Overview of Telecommunication Networks

### 4G Core Components
- **eUTRAN**
- **UE (User Equipment)**
- **eNodeB (Evolved Node B)**
- **MME (Mobility Management Entity)**
- **PDN-GW (Packet Data Network Gateway)**
- **Serv-GW (Serving Gateway)**
- **HSS (Home Subscriber Server)**
- **IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem)**
- **S1-MME (Signaling Interface)**
- **S1-U (User Plane Interface)**
- **OSS (Operations Support System)**
- **IP Network**

## Typical Environment

## Base Station Physical Setup
A typical base station setup includes:
- **Baseband Unit (BBU)**: Usually located on the ground
- **Remote Radio Head/Unit (RRH/RRU)**: Placed on the cell mast or on the ground
- **Antenna**: Available in various shapes and sizes, often vector antennas
- **Power Distribution Unit (PDU)**
- **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**
- **Ventilation**
- **Temperature/Humidity Sensors**
- **Alarm Sensors**
- **Extra box with power connections**

### Power and Connectivity
- **Components run on -48V**: Not ±48V (96V differential), but 48V connected differently.
- **RRU Functionality**: Receives raw RF signals via fiber and sends them out via copper to the antenna.
- **Frequency Band**: Capable of serving specific frequency bands.

## The Idea
1. Understand the base station setup.
2. Purchase an old base station from the field.
3. Get the base station running in an emulated environment.
4. Perform a configuration and security evaluation.

## What We Need
- **Baseband Unit (BBU)**: Typically standing on the ground.
- **Remote Radio Head/Unit (RRU)**: May be placed on the cell mast or on the ground.
- **Antenna**: Various shapes and sizes, often vector antennas.
- **All active parts interconnected**: BBU, RRU, sensors, power supply, vents.

### Baseband Unit (BBU) Details
- **Frame for holding power unit and functional blades**.
- **Backplane for interconnection between components**.
- **Multiple interfaces (LAN, UART, CAN)**.
- **Functional blades decide the network type**.
- **Ericsson Models**: DUL/DUW/DUG for Digital Unit LTE/WCDMA/GSM.
- **Single BBU could serve multiple networks**.
- **Single blade can serve multiple cells**.
- **Using sector antennas, a single mast could serve 4 cells in 4 different directions**.

## Variants of an eNodeB
- **Different Shapes and Sizes**: Rack, "Small-Boxes", Portable.
- **Cell Types**: Macro (>100m), Micro (100m), Pico (20-50m), HeNB (10-20m).
- **Encryption Termination Point**: RF channel and backend channel encryption.

## Implementing a Lab
### Quick How-To
#### How to Start…
- **Purchasing a BTS**: Be aware of the architecture.
- **Vendor-Specific Names**:
  - Nokia: FlexiBTS
  - Huawei: BBU + LMPT/UMPT
  - Ericsson: RBS + DUL
  - ALU: MBS

### eBay
### Lab Setup – What You Need
- **Base Station**: RRU is optional if you just want to play with the BTS itself.
- **Power Supply**: -48V ~ 5A will be sufficient.
- **Power Connectors**: Finding or making the right connectors may take some time.
- **Proper Switch**: Backhaul interface uses multiple VLANs (signaling, configuration).
- **Network Cables**: A stack of cables.
- **Box/VM**: Set up multiple IP addresses, virtual interfaces with VLANs, and an NTP server.

### Our Lab
- **GPS**: For timing or positioning during setup.
- **EC**: Connection to the power unit.
- **AUX**: For clustering multiple units.
- **LMT A/B**: Local maintenance terminals.
- **TN A/B**: Backhaul Access – S1.
- **IDL**: Currently unknown.
- **A, B, C, D, E, F**: Interfaces towards RRU.
- **Ericsson RBS6601 - DUL**: RJ-45 & Gbic Interfaces.

### The First Sniff
- **Emulate Signaling and O&M Connection**:
  - Vlan 3: Signaling
  - Vlan 2: O&M
- **Traffic Observation**: The eNB is designed to operate almost as standalone, requiring minimal modifications.

### The Second Sniff
- **Transport Interface**: Build Your Own Provider Network

### S1-Interface
- **Activation**: After the host 10.27.99.169 on VLAN 2 becomes available, the eNodeB activates communication over the S1-Interface.
- **SCTP INIT Requests**: Tries to reach 7 different hosts to establish a connection.
- **Divided into Two Parts**:
