**Title: Black Hat USA 2018: 18 Lessons and Lulz - The 4th Annual Black Hat USA NOC Report**

The Black Hat Network Operations Center (NOC) team is back with another year of revealing and often perplexing statistics. In this 4th annual report, we will share the data that continues to both baffle and amuse us. We will detail the tools and techniques we use to set up, stabilize, and secure the network, as well as the improvements we have implemented over the past year to enhance our operations.

Additionally, we will highlight some of the more humorous network activities and what they reveal about the behavior of security professionals on an open WiFi network. Spoiler alert: The results are not always flattering. Our findings underscore the need for better conduct and awareness among security experts, even in a controlled environment like Black Hat.
