### Tourism Industry Context
Tourism is one of the most promising sectors of the global economy. The World Tourism Organization predicts a 200% increase in tourist arrivals worldwide by 2020, driven by factors such as increased leisure time and its social importance. According to Carl H. Marcussen from the Centre for Regional and Tourism Research of Denmark, the European online travel market has grown significantly, from €2.5 billion in 2000 to €18.2 billion in 2004, with further growth expected to reach €23.4 billion in 2005 and €28.5 billion in 2006.

The rapid growth of the Internet and the continuous adoption of innovative technology have led to significant changes in the travel industry. One of the latest concepts in the tourism industry is "Dynamic Packaging," which allows a system to combine different tourism products to create a package. This offers advantages to tourists, such as lower prices and the convenience of entering personal data only once to purchase all products in a package.

### SEED Project Objectives
The SEED project aims to develop a new way to implement dynamic packaging systems using Semantic Web technology. The project will integrate various tourism data sources, which often have different data formats and access methods. By creating a semantic model of the tourism domain and associating it with each data source, the project aims to facilitate the integration of these sources.

### General Project Information
**Objectives:**
- To help the travel industry leverage the latest Internet technologies, including Web services, Web processes, and semantics.
- To implement a semantic architecture for dynamic packaging applications that integrates tourism data systems to create dynamic packages.

**Main Deliverables:**
- Data Extraction System
- Data Model Mapping Application (Syntactic/Semantic)
- An Ontology for e-tourism
- Dynamic Packaging System
- Application for defining business rules for e-tourism
