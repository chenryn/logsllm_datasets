### Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

When selecting "Edit Selected Layout," users should have the option to adjust the zone spacing. Zone spacing refers to the buffer between zones, which, when non-zero, includes a transparent grid around a window that is locked to the zone. This option will only be available when creating a new layout.
