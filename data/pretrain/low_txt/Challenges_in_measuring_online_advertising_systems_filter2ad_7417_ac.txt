### 3.2 Analysis of Google Ads

**Collecting Each Snapshot:**
Figure 4(c) presents the similarity scores between instance A and other instances. At first glance, it might appear that browsing behavior, recent searches, and recent product clicks result in different sets of ads. However, even for the control pair, the similarity score is very low, indicating a high level of noise. We compared the fraction of ads shown to A and D that contained one or more search query terms and found no significant difference. The same was true for ads containing interests associated with instance C and product names or categories used for instance E. Therefore, we believe that Google does not currently use recent browsing, search, or click behavior in selecting website ads. The high noise levels, however, prevent us from making a definitive conclusion.

**Methodology and Future Monitoring:**
The measurement methodology developed here will allow us to monitor the evolution of these systems over time. The high noise levels may be due to the fact that contextual ad systems have not yet been optimized for relevancy to the same extent as search ad systems, especially considering that Google only began collecting this data in 2009 [9]. As contextual ad targeting improves, we expect the similarity score of the control pair to increase. Depending on whether the scores for various user behaviors remain the same or increase in the future, we hope to conclusively determine whether these behaviors are used in ad selection.

### 3.3 Online Social Network Ads

**Facebook Ad Analysis:**
Next, we turn our attention to ads on online social networking sites, specifically Facebook. Our goal is to understand which pieces of profile information (gender, age, education, sexual preference, etc.) Facebook uses today.

**Experiment 7: Profile Information Impact:**
We set up three or more Facebook profiles: profiles A and B were identical (control), while profile C and subsequent profiles differed from A in the value of the profile parameter of interest. The number of unique profiles depended on the number of values that the parameter could take (e.g., 2 for gender, 5 for education). When not being varied, the gender was set to female, the age was set to 30, the location was set to New York, and the remaining fields were left empty.

**Results:**
Figure 5 shows the time-series of similarity scores for six different profile parameters. In summary, Facebook uses all profile elements we checked. All plots exhibit diurnal behavior, with an abrupt change in the similarity score around midnight US East Coast time. This pattern, also observed in [5], is likely due to the daily reactivation of ads that exhausted their budget the previous day. Among the profile elements, age and gender appear to be the primary factors affecting ads. While there are specific values for education and relationship status that affect ads, not all values have the same impact. For example, there is little difference between ads targeted to users without any listed education and those in high school. Similarly, if the gender is male or the relationship status is married, the relationship status has only a small impact on ads. The greatest impact of relationship status on ads is seen for women who are engaged.

**Experiment 8: Sexual Preference Impact:**
Finally, we set up six Facebook profiles to check the impact of sexual preference, a highly sensitive personal attribute. Two profiles (male control) were for males interested in females, two (female control) for females interested in males, and one test profile each for a male interested in males and a female interested in females. The age and location were set to 25 and Washington D.C., respectively.

**Results:**
Figure 6 plots the similarity scores for one week of data. Despite the general noise, there is a measurable difference between the control and test pairs. We further manually verified based on ad content that this difference is qualitative (e.g., ads for gay bars were never shown for the control profiles but were frequent for the test profiles). The median similarity score for gay women was 0.15 higher than for gay men, indicating that advertisers target more strongly to the latter demographic.

**Concerns:**
Alarmingly, we found ads where the text was completely neutral to sexual preference (e.g., for a nursing degree in a medical college in Florida) that were targeted exclusively to gay men. The danger with such ads is that the user reading the ad would have no idea that by clicking it, they would reveal their sexual preference and a unique identifier (cookie, IP address, or email address if they sign up on the advertiser's site). Furthermore, such deceptive ads are not uncommon; exactly half of the 66 ads shown exclusively to gay men (more than 50 times) during our experiment did not mention "gay" anywhere in the ad text.

**Overall Findings:**
While location affects Google ads, behavioral targeting does not significantly affect either search or website ads on Google. Location, user demographics, interests, and sexual preference all affect Facebook ads. As these systems evolve, our methodology can track changes in their use of user data. We aim to inform and keep informed the ongoing public debate about user privacy.

### 4. Related Work

There is limited prior work on studying ad networks through measurement. In [5], we presented an ad hoc measurement result for Google ads. Based on our current experience, we now believe that result significantly underestimated the number of ads and did not properly account for noise.

### 5. Summary

We have presented the first principled and robust methodology for measurement-based studies of online ad networks. Our work informs the ongoing privacy debate regarding the use of user data for targeting search ads, contextual ads, and ads on online social networks. Like most measurement studies, this analysis is a snapshot in time. Moving forward, we hope that the methodology we have developed can continue to be used to broaden our knowledge of online advertising and track trends in the future.
