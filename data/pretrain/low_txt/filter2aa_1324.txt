### Overview

**What This Presentation Covers:**
- An overview of Smart Meter and Smart Grid technology.
- A detailed network traffic-based approach to understanding these systems.
  - As opposed to meter firmware modification.
  - Concepts, protocols, and other relevant details.
- **Caveat:** We are penetration testers and network experts, not RF/SCADA/hardware specialists.

**What This Presentation Does Not Cover:**
- How to compromise the Smart Grid or Smart Meters.
- How to obtain free power.
- How to cause a blackout in Las Vegas.

### What is "Smart Metering"?

#### A Brief History
- **First Generation Meters:** Traditional, non-digital meters.
- **Second Generation "One-Way" Meters:** Basic data transmission from the meter to the utility.
- **Third Generation Meters (AMI):** Automated Metering Infrastructure.

### Why Smart Meters?

**For Utilities:**
- Reduce staff overhead.
- Enable remote start/stop service.
- Improve demand forecasting and dynamic pricing.
- Facilitate remote firmware updates and diagnostics.

**For Consumers:**
- Monitor and track energy consumption.
- Opt-in for "smart appliances."
- Potentially reduce costs (in theory).

### Case Studies: Smart Meter Network Types

**Example 1: Licensed Spectrum**
- **Frequency:** 900MHz licensed band.
- **Technology:** Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS).
- **Network Topology:** Hybrid star/mesh.
- **Advantages:**
  - Reliability.
  - Longevity (as long as the band license is renewed).
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Overhead.
  - Proprietary system.

**Example 2: Existing 3rd Party Network**
- **Technology:** GPRS (primarily GSM-based, with CDMA as an option).
- **Connectivity:** Point-to-point.
- **Advantages:**
  - Uses existing infrastructure.
  - Wide coverage.
  - Layered security (GSM and VPN tunnel).
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Limited control over the reliability of the metering network.
  - Future-proofing concerns.

**Example 3: Other Implementations**
- **Powerline Communication:**
  - Popular in EU and Japan.
  - Distance-dependent.
- **Broadband:**
  - Leverages existing infrastructure.
  - Interoperability is key.
  - Utilizes existing technologies.

### Home Area Networks (HANs) and "Smart" Appliances

**HAN: Home Area Network**
- **Keys to Success:**
  - Low resource footprint.
  - Low power consumption.
  - Security.
  - Low bandwidth.
- **Solution:** Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)
  - **Topology:** Mesh/Star/Cluster.
  - **Security:** Pre-shared keys (AES EAX).
  - **Effective Range:** ~100 feet.
- **Interaction with Appliances:**
  - Enables smart home devices to communicate and optimize energy use.

### Security and Policy Implications

**Is This Secure? It Depends...**
- **Attackers:** Who are they?
- **Features:** Security only works if all features are utilized.
- **Reliance on 3rd Party Security:** GSM.
- **Feature Fluff:** Unnecessary features can introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Security Through Obscurity:**
  - Use of FHSS and proprietary FSK.
  - Proprietary command sets.
- **Physical Security:**
  - Location of the attacker.
  - Equipment security.
- **Incident Response:**

**Policy and Legal Implications**
- **Regulatory Compliance:**
  - "Our network is secure because the FCC says you can't play in our sandbox."
  - "Transmissions cannot be duplicated using off-the-shelf equipment."
  - Use of USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) can challenge this.
- **Critical Infrastructure Protection Act (CIPA):**
  - Does this mean any transmission network is considered critical infrastructure?

**More Policy Implications**
- **Functionality First:**
  - Ensure the system works properly (e.g., California's experience).
- **Privacy Issues:**
  - Electrical surveillance.
  - Appliance control: Who protects the consumer's HAN from the utility?

**Who Benefits?**
- **Utilities:**
  - Cost savings.
  - American Reinvestment and Recovery Act.
  - Pass remaining costs to consumers if needed.
- **Consumers:**
  - Inelastic demand; unlikely to change lifestyle.
  - More benefits from power-saving appliances.
- **Businesses:**
  - Manufacturing: Schedule process runs more efficiently.

### Where Are We Going?

- **The Smart Grid is Coming:**
  - Replacement of aging infrastructure.
- **Need for Standards:**
  - IP?
  - ANSI 12.19/12.22?
  - Zigbee?
- **Roles:**
  - **Utilities:** Deploy securely and responsibly.
  - **Government:** Regulate (modestly).
  - **Consumers:** Advocate for their rights and privacy.

### To-Doâ€™s

- Extend the time frame for further research.
- Construct a legitimate test environment with fewer legal implications.
- Conduct a thorough penetration test of the network.
  - Remember, at its core, it's IP-based.
