### Networking Activity on the Day of the Robbery

The analysis of networking activity on the day of the robbery revealed that the social snapshots accurately correlated with an F1-score of 0.84. Both accounts contained treasonous private messages. The timeline, generated from the social snapshot and illustrated in Figure 7, shows Bob’s online activity on the day of the bank robbery.

To determine if the pristine digital image of Bob’s posting could be recovered, the investigator used a digital image forensic module to match images from the forensic image with those collected through seven independent social snapshots. The module reported a positive match for the digital image named “CIMG2216.JPG.” The original EXIF information of this image confirmed that the alibi group picture was taken a week before the robbery.

### Social Snapshot Open-Source Release

We have released the core framework for Facebook under the GPL v3 open-source license. The source code includes the social snapshot client, our third-party application, and the patched Selenium server. However, the analysis and photo forensics modules are not included in the open-source release. Additionally, we decided not to release the hijack module due to its potential for misuse in malicious attacks.

### Discussion

Our evaluation required, on average, 9,802 API and 238 HTTP requests to successfully snapshot an entire social networking account in less than 15 minutes. Traditional web-crawling methods would require over 10,000 HTTP requests to snapshot a single test account, and the generated network traffic would likely be detected and blocked by social networking providers. Our approach retrieved the majority of social networking account data without additional parsing and with exact timestamps.

During the implementation of our social snapshot techniques, Facebook's website layout changed several times. Since only contact details were crawled, we could promptly adapt the parser of our client, while our third-party application did not require any changes. As Facebook has no review process for third-party applications, we could make our application available straightforwardly. Third-party applications on Facebook do not need to appear in their application directory to be usable.

Apart from digital forensics, social snapshots can also raise user awareness. Users can run our social snapshot tool to get a report on their account data, helping them understand the extent of information stored by their social networking providers. This could help users make more informed decisions about the information they post.

Unencrypted social networking sessions enable the gathering of social snapshots for digital forensics but also pose a serious security threat. Since HTTPS is not enabled by default on most social networking services, user sessions can easily be hijacked. Tools like Firesheep and Faceniﬀ, which were released to create awareness about insecure sessions, can be coupled with our social snapshot tool, allowing attackers to harvest complete account snapshots automatically. It has been shown that the large amount of sensitive data stored in social networks can be used for large-scale spam attacks via session hijacking.

### Related Work

Several forensic frameworks have been proposed in recent years, but none were specifically designed to extract information from social networks. To our knowledge, no other publication has examined the impact of a hybrid API and crawler-based approach to digital forensics in social networks.

Although social networks are not inherently part of the cloud computing paradigm, the area of cloud forensics presents related challenges, such as the unknown location of data centers and the difficulty of obtaining access to forensic data sources without trusting a third party. PyFlag is a modular network forensic framework that can rebuild HTML pages from packets, allowing examiners to view the webpages a suspect has seen. Xplico is an Internet traffic decoder that can retrieve Facebook chat conversations from network dumps.

In relation to our digital image forensics module, PhotoDNA is a program used by law enforcement agencies to detect known and explicitly illegal pictures based on calculated signatures. Similar to signature-based antivirus software, a trusted party calculates the signatures for illicit pictures, which are then compared with the signatures of pictures in webpages or from forensic hard drive examinations. Another approach uses characteristics of embedded thumbnails to authenticate the source of a picture. While these approaches are similar to our module, they have not been designed or employed to compare digital images from social networks with pictures from a suspect’s hard drive.

### Concluding Remarks

Social snapshots explore novel techniques for the automated collection of digital evidence from social networking services. Compared to state-of-the-art web crawling techniques, our approach significantly reduces network traffic, is easier to maintain, and has access to additional and hidden information. Extensive evaluations have shown that our techniques are practical and effective in collecting complete information from a given social networking account quickly and without detection from social networking providers.

We believe that our techniques can be used in cases where no legal cooperation with social networking providers exists. To provide a digital evidence collection tool for modern forensic investigations of social networking activities, we have released our core social snapshot framework as open-source software. We will continue to extend the analysis capabilities of our forensic software and collaborate with partners on the evaluation of real-world cases.

Recruiting test subjects in a security lab and computer science environment was challenging, as many people misconceived our temporary Facebook access request as a social engineering attack. We would like to thank the human volunteers who supported our experiments by providing their Facebook data. We also thank Barbara Weber and Robert Sablatnig for their advice and feedback in the creation of this paper.
