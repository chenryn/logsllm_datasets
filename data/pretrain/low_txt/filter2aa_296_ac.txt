### Capacity Planning

The number of NetBoot client computers your server can support depends on several factors, including the server's configuration, the startup times of the clients, the server’s hard disk space, and other considerations. When planning for your server and network needs, consider the following:

- **Ethernet Speed**: Both client computers and the server require 100Base-T or faster Ethernet connections. As you add more clients, you may need to increase the speed of your server’s Ethernet connections. Ideally, take advantage of the Gigabit Ethernet capacity built into your Mac OS X server hardware by connecting it to a Gigabit switch. From the switch, connect each NetBoot client with either Gigabit Ethernet or 100 Mb Ethernet.

- **Hard Disk Capacity and Number of Images**: Boot and install images occupy significant hard disk space on server volumes, depending on the size and configuration of the system image and the number of images stored. These images can be distributed across multiple volumes or servers. For more information, refer to “Performance and Load Balancing” on page 45.

- **Hard Disk Capacity and Number of Users**: If you have a large number of Mac OS 9 or Mac OS X diskless clients, consider adding a separate file server to store temporary user documents. The system software for a disk image is written to a shadow image for each client booting from the disk image. To estimate the required hard disk capacity, multiply the size of the shadow image by the number of clients.

- **Number of Ethernet Ports on the Switch**: Distributing NetBoot clients over multiple Ethernet ports on your switch can improve performance. Each port should serve a distinct segment.

### Setup Overview

Here is an overview of the basic steps for setting up NetBoot service:

#### Step 1: Evaluate and Update Your Network, Servers, and Client Computers

- **Determine the Number of Clients**: The number of client computers you can support using NetBoot is determined by the number of servers, their configurations, hard disk storage capacity, and other factors. See “Capacity Planning” on page 16.
- **Network and Server Adjustments**: Based on the evaluation, you may need to add servers or hard disks, increase Ethernet ports on your server, or make other changes. You may also want to set up more subnets for your BootP clients.
- **Subnet Implementation**: Implement subnets on this server (or other servers) to take advantage of NetBoot filtering. See “Restricting NetBoot Clients by Filtering Addresses” on page 38.
- **User Authentication**: If you plan to provide authentication and personalized work environments for NetBoot client users using Workgroup Manager (for Mac OS X clients) and Macintosh Manager (for Mac OS 9 clients), set this up and import users from the Mac OS X Server Users & Groups database before creating disk images. Ensure at least one Macintosh Manager user is assigned to the System Access workgroup for Mac OS 9 clients and the Workgroup Manager for Mac OS X clients.

#### Step 2: Create Disk Images for Client Computers

- **Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X Disk Images**: Set up both Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X disk images for client computers to start up from. A preconfigured Mac OS 9 image is provided with Mac OS X Server on the NetBoot for Mac OS 9 CD, available separately. The Mac OS 9 disk image can be modified. If you are supporting new client computers released after Mac OS X Server version 10.0.3, modify the Mac OS 9 disk image to support these clients. See “Modifying a Mac OS 9 Boot Image” on page 25.
- **Creating Mac OS X Disk Images**: Use Network Image Utility to create Mac OS X disk images. See “Creating a Mac OS X Boot Image” on page 19.
- **Application Packages**: Use PackageMaker to create application packages that can be added to an image. Application software packages can be installed independently or along with Mac OS X system software. See “Creating Packages” on page 30.

#### Step 3: Set Up DHCP

- **DHCP Requirement**: NetBoot requires a DHCP server running either on the local server or another server on the network. Ensure you have a sufficient range of IP addresses to accommodate the number of clients using NetBoot simultaneously.
- **Gateway Configuration**: If your NetBoot server is also supplying DHCP service, configure your server as a gateway. Configure your subnets to use the server’s IP address as the router IP address.
- **Start DHCP Service**: Ensure the DHCP service is started.

#### Step 4: Configure and Turn On NetBoot Service

- **Configuration**: Use the NetBoot settings in Server Admin to configure NetBoot on your server. See Chapter 3, “Setting Up NetBoot Service.”
- **Enable NetBoot Service**: Use Server Admin to turn on NetBoot service. See “Starting NetBoot and Related Services” on page 34 and “Enabling Images” on page 34.

#### Step 5: Set Up Ethernet Address Filtering (Optional)

- **Filtering by Hardware Address**: NetBoot filtering is done by client computer hardware address. Each client’s hardware address is automatically registered the first time the client attempts to start up from a NetBoot disk image. You can allow or disallow specific clients by address. See “Restricting NetBoot Clients by Filtering Addresses” on page 38.

#### Step 6: Test Your NetBoot Setup

- **Testing**: Due to the risk of data loss or network disruption (by misconfiguring DHCP), test your NetBoot setup before implementing it on all clients. Test each different model of Macintosh to ensure there are no issues with the boot ROM for a particular hardware type.

#### Step 7: Set Up All Client Computers to Use NetBoot

- **Mac OS 9 Clients**: Use the Startup Disk control panel to select a startup disk image on the server, then restart the computer. See “Selecting a NetBoot Boot Image (Mac OS 9)” on page 40. Note: You may need to update the Startup Disk control panel on client computers running Mac OS 9 from their local hard disks so they can view NetBoot disk images in the control panel. See “Updating the Startup Disk Control Panel” on page 39.
- **Mac OS X Clients (version 10.2 or later)**: Use the Startup Disk System Preference pane to select a startup disk image on the server, then restart the computer. See “Selecting a NetBoot Boot Image (Mac OS X)” on page 40.
- **Any Client**: Restart the computer and hold down the N key until the NetBoot icon starts flashing on the screen. The client will start up from the default image on the NetBoot server. See “Starting Up Using the N Key” on page 42.

### Creating Boot and Install Images

This chapter provides step-by-step instructions for preparing boot or install images that can be used with NetBoot service.

#### Creating Mac OS X Boot Images

- **Overview**: The instructions show how to create boot images of the Mac OS X operating system for starting up client computers over the network. For help creating Mac OS 9 images, see “Creating Mac OS 9 Boot Images” on page 25.
- **Creating a Mac OS X Boot Image**:
  1. Log in to the server as an administrative user.
  2. Open Network Image Utility and click New Boot.
  3. In the General pane, enter a name for the image.
  4. Enter an Image ID. For a unique image, choose an ID in the range 1–4095. For load balancing, use an ID in the range 4096–65535.
  5. (Optional) Enter notes or other information in the Description field.
  6. (CD source only) Choose the default language for the system.
  7. Choose whether the image is to be delivered using NFS or HTTP. If unsure, choose NFS.
  8. Click Contents and choose the source for the image (install CD, mounted boot volume, or existing disk image).
  9. (Optional) Add an application package, system update package, or script to the image.
  10. (CD source only) Click Default User, enter a user name, short name, and password for the system’s default user account.
  11. Click Create Image.
  12. In the Save As dialog, choose where to save the image.
  13. Click Save.

- **Important Notes**:
  - Don’t open the .nbi folder in /Library/NetBoot/NetBootSPn while the image is being created; clients won’t be able to use the resulting image.
  - You can also create a boot image using commands in Terminal. For more information, see the system image chapter of the command-line administration guide.

#### Installing the Classic Environment on a Mac OS X Disk Image

- **Overview**: You can install the Classic environment onto a Mac OS X image by copying a Mac OS 9.2.2 system folder into an “unlocked” NetBoot image. This procedure works only for NetBoot images, not Network Install images.
- **Steps**:
  1. Ensure the disk image file (.dmg) is unlocked.
  2. Double-click the image file to mount it.
  3. Drag a Mac OS 9 System Folder to the disk image.
  4. In the server’s System Preferences, open the Classic preferences pane and select the disk image as the startup volume for the Classic environment.
  5. Click Start to start up the Classic environment.
  6. Shut down the Classic environment, then eject the image file.

#### Configuring Directory Access for a Boot Image

- **Overview**: If you are not using DHCP to provide NetBoot clients with Open Directory information, you can set up directory access information and copy it to a boot image.
- **Steps**:
  1. Open Directory Access (in /Applications/Utilities) on a running system and configure directory settings.
  2. Mount the boot image and copy the directory /Library/Preferences/DirectoryService/ from the running system to the same location in the boot image.
  3. Warning: Do not modify a disk image that is in use by any NetBoot clients. Make a copy of the file and modify the copy instead.

#### Adding an OS Update Package to a Mac OS X Boot Image

- **Overview**: You can add a Mac OS X system update package to an existing NetBoot image to ensure clients start up from the latest system.
- **Steps**:
  1. Open Server Admin and select NetBoot in the Computers & Services list.
  2. Disable the image you want to update.
  3. Open Network Image Utility and click Images.
  4. Select the image and click Edit.
  5. In the Contents tab, click the Add (+) button and choose the OS update package.
  6. Click Save.
  7. Re-enable the image in the Images pane of Server Admin NetBoot settings.

#### Creating a Mac OS X Boot Image From an Existing System

- **Overview**: If you already have a client computer set up to suit your users, you can use Network Image Utility to create a boot image based on that client’s configuration.
- **Steps**:
  1. Boot the computer from a partition other than the one you’re using as the image source.
  2. Copy the Network Image Utility to the client computer.
  3. Open the Network Image Utility on the client and click New Boot.
  4. Click the Contents tab and choose the partition you want to use from the Image Source pop-up list.
  5. Enter the remaining image information in the other panes, then click Create.
  6. After the image has been created on the client, export it to the server.

#### Synchronizing an Image With an Updated Source Volume

- **Overview**: If you create an image from a system volume and later update the original volume, you can apply the updates to the image without re-creating it.
- **Steps**:
  1. Open Server Admin and select NetBoot in the Computers & Services list.
  2. Disable the image you want to update.
  3. Open the Network Image Utility.
  4. Choose Network Image Utility > Preferences, enable “Add items and sync with source when editing,” and close the preferences window.
  5. Click Images, select the image, and click Edit.
  6. Click Contents and choose the updated source volume from the Image Source pop-up menu.
  7. Click Save.
  8. Re-enable the image using Server Admin.

#### Choosing the Protocol Used to Deliver an Image

- **Overview**: You can use either NFS or HTTP to send images from the server to a client. You can choose this protocol when you create the image using the Network Image Utility or later when the image is listed in Server Admin.
- **Steps**:
  - To choose the protocol when you create the image, select either NFS or HTTP in the General pane in the Network Image Utility.
  - To choose the protocol for an existing image, select the NetBoot service in Server Admin, click Settings, and choose a protocol from the pop-up list next to the image in the Images pane.

#### Compressing Images to Save Disk Space

- **Overview**: You can create compressed images by setting a preference in the Network Image Utility.
- **Steps**:
  1. Open Network Image Utility.
  2. Choose Network Image Utility > Preferences and select “Compress image when creating or editing.”
  3. Ensure the volume on which you’re creating the image has enough free space for both the uncompressed and compressed images.

#### Changing How Mac OS X NetBoot Clients Allocate Shadow Files

- **Overview**: By default, a Mac OS X NetBoot client places its shadow files in a NetBootClientsn share point on the server. If no such share point is available, the client tries to store its shadow files on a local hard disk.
- **Steps**:
  - For Mac OS X version 10.3 and later images set for diskless booting, change this behavior by specifying a value for the NETBOOT_SHADOW variable in the image’s /etc/hostconfig file. Allowed values include:
    - **-NETWORK-**: (Default) Try to use a server NetBootClientsn share point for storing shadow files. If no server share point is available, use a local drive.
    - **-NETWORK_ONLY-**: Try to use a server NetBootClientsn share point for storing shadow files. If no server share point is available, do not boot.
    - **-LOCAL-**: Try to use a local drive for storing shadow files. If no local drive is available, use a server NetBootClientsn share point.
    - **-LOCAL_ONLY-**: Try to use a local drive for storing shadow files. If no local drive is available, do not boot.

#### Creating Mac OS 9 Boot Images

- **Overview**: You cannot use the Network Image Utility to create Mac OS 9 images. However, you can use the image provided on the NetBoot for Mac OS 9 CD (available separately).
- **Installing a Mac OS 9 Boot Image**:
  - Log in as root, then open NetBoot.pkg on the NetBoot for Mac OS 9 CD.
  - The Installer installs the Mac OS 9 NetBoot image folder in the /Library/NetBoot/NetBootSPn/DefaultMacOS92.nbi directory (where n is the volume number).

- **Modifying a Mac OS 9 Boot Image**:
  - To install software on or change the preconfigured Mac OS 9 disk image, start up from a NetBoot client computer, connect to the NetBoot server volume, and open the NetBoot Desktop Admin program. Your changes will be available after the last time the NetBoot client computer running NetBoot Desktop Admin restarts.
  - Before starting, ensure you have the name and password of a user with read/write access to the NetBoot server volume (e.g., the administrator). This procedure requires restarting the client computer several times.
