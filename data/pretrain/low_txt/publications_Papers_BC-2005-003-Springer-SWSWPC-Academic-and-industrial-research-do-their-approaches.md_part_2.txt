### Services for Electronic Commerce and Electronic Business

Web Services Description Language (WSDL) is widely used for specifying services in electronic commerce and electronic business. However, WSDL does not support the specification of processes composed of basic web services, nor does it incorporate semantic capabilities.

In this area, Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS) has gained significant prominence. BPEL4WS enables the definition of business processes as coordinated sets of web service interactions. The W3Câ€™s Web Services Choreography Working Group is also actively exploring this technical domain.

Despite the industrial support for standards like WSDL, BPEL, and Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI), few commercial products have successfully implemented a robust semantic layer alongside their web services infrastructure. Two primary considerations for semantics in web services are the process layer and the data layer. Most enterprise vendors recognize the importance and value of semantic metadata but often implement solutions in proprietary and inflexible ways, using their own metadata formats for internal semantic reconciliation.

Regarding process and orchestration semantics, many vendors are taking a "wait-and-see" approach as emerging standards converge. OWL-S, Semantic Web Services/Semantic Web Service Modeling Language (SWWS/WSML), and BPEL each bring important strengths to an overarching semantic web services capability. Leadership from organizations like the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI) and the W3C have expressed a strong interest in converging the best features of these specifications. Vendors are likely to wait for this alignment before implementing any of these on their own.

In contrast, many industrial research groups, such as IBM, HP, France Telecom, and Fujitsu, have already applied semantics to web services for innovative, discovery-driven use cases. Unlike the "negotiation-style" semantic web services, some adopt a "query-driven" approach. Some commercial vendors have started implementing semantic layers on top of web services to issue queries instead of writing more rigid contracts. Annotating web services using the W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) can make it easier to evolve services in dynamic business environments. This involves modeling tools that map ontologies to web service WSDL interfaces, and a runtime inference engine that issues query plans to the underlying services. This style of semantic query is distinct from process-centric approaches but both help automate meaningful access to abundant corporate information.

### Common Ground for Future Work

For web services to become a platform for semantic service-oriented computing, academic and industrial researchers need to develop terminologies, technologies, and products that enable sophisticated solutions for the advertisement, discovery, selection, composition, and execution of web services.

Recently, the Semantic Web Services Initiative (SWSI), a collaboration between academic and industrial researchers, has been established to create an infrastructure that combines Semantic Web and web services to enable automation in all aspects of web services. SWSI will also serve as a forum for working towards the convergence of OWL-S with the products of the SWWS/WSMO/WSML/WSMX research effort. These efforts provide web service providers with a core set of constructs for describing the properties of their web services in a computer-interpretable form. OWL-S facilitates the automation of web service tasks, including automated discovery, composition, and execution. The current version of OWL-S builds on the Ontology Web Language (OWL) recommendation by the W3C's Web-Ontology Working Group. OWL-S is the first well-researched web services ontology and has numerous academic users.

WSMO is a complete ontology for defining Semantic Web Services, following the WSMF vision. It is defined using an ontology language based on F-Logic and includes all concepts required for Semantic Web Services: Ontology, Mediator, Goal, and Web Service Interface. WSML is a family of languages that allow semantic web service designers to define services in a formal language. WSMX provides a standard architecture for the execution of semantic web services, with a component-based architecture that is one possible implementation of service-oriented architectures. WSMX itself has execution semantics.

The most significant common ground for industry and academia is simplifying semantic web services. As with all semantic technologies, the rigor required to express semantic web services metadata (OWL, OWL-S, F-Logic, XML, etc.) with precision is daunting without good tools. One day, analysts will be able to drag-and-drop process diagrams and point-and-click ontology mappings. Until then, researchers in industry and academia should focus on developing modeling heuristics to lower barriers for widespread adoption.

Another likely path for common ground is reaching agreement on ontologies for service descriptions, processes, and security. At a more fundamental level, researchers will need to measure the strengths and limitations of different representations, such as description logics, horn-logic, and F-Logic, for the various layers of the semantic web services architecture. The infusion of semantics will significantly alter today's conceptions of the service-oriented architecture paradigm.

### Summary

Many believe that a new web will emerge in the next few years, driven by large-scale research and development in the Semantic Web and web services. The intersection of these two, Semantic Web Services, may prove even more significant. Academia has approached this area from the Semantic Web side, while industry is beginning to consider its importance from the web services perspective. Academia started developing semantic-based web services languages, such as DAML-S (now OWL-S), to enrich the description of web services and facilitate greater automation. The goal was to make explicit the representation of the semantics underlying data, services, and other resources, providing a qualitatively new level of service. Industry, on the other hand, focused on developing an infrastructure that allows software applications to be accessed and executed via the web, resulting in practical and functional standards like UDDI, WSDL, SOAP, XLANG, WSFL, WSCI, BPML, and BPEL4WS. While these approaches were initially parallel, there is now some convergence. Both academia and industry realize that for the sake of automation and dynamism in all aspects of web services provision, it is essential to create an infrastructure that combines, at least to some extent, Semantic Web and web services technologies. This paper highlights some of the contributions of both sectors and discusses recent cooperative efforts such as SWSI. The potential impact of Semantic Web Service technology makes it essential for further and expanding cooperative efforts in the future.
