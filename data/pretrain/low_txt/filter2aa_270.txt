**Quote:**
"The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."
- John Gilmore, ~1993

### The First Crypto Wars
- **Historical Context:** 
  - If all you have is a hammer...
  - If all you have is a J.D. ...
  - And the Internet was a safer place for it!
  - Thank your lucky PKIs for ECCN 5D002!!
- **Reflections:**
  - We thought we had solved the field...
  - But thanks to Comey, more work remains.

### The Next Crypto Wars
- **Challenges:**
  - What could possibly go wrong?
  - What if we re-named back doors?

**Note:**
- "The slide you are about to see is false."

### Legislation
- **Global Trends:**
  - Many countries are considering legislation that would:
    - Mandate backdoors,
    - Mandate access to plaintext, or
    - Endanger encryption.
- **Examples:**
  - UK IPB and the Death of e2e
  - AUS DSGL and the Death of all crypto...

**Equation:**
- ! + " = #
- $$$

### Thanks Obama
- **October 2015:**
  - "We will not —for now—call for legislation requiring companies to decode messages for law enforcement."
- **November 2015:**
  - Identify laws that need to be changed to deal with “going dark.”
- **March 2016:**
  - "My conclusion so far is that you cannot take an absolutist view on this... It's fetishizing our phones above every other value. And that can't be the right answer."

### All Writs Act Litigation
- **Apple v. FBI:**
  - San Bernardino iPhone case
  - Case in EDNY

### Other Litigation
- **Potential Cases:**
  - Wiretap Act litigation (e.g., New York Times report on WhatsApp)
  - FISA Court orders (EFF is in the middle of a FOIA case to get access to them)

### Burr-Feinstein Bill
- **Key Provisions:**
  - Would require providers to decrypt on demand
  - Criminal and civil penalties
  - Applies to communications, storage, and licensing (including app stores and open source)
  - Not just end-to-end and full-disk encryption
  - This would outlaw computers as we know them

### 2016 Outlook
- **Possible Scenarios:**
  - Key escrow mandate (unlikely)
  - Burr-Feinstein (definitely won’t happen in its current form)
  - Informal pressure
  - No ban will reach FOSS crypto
  - CALEA-like mandate
  - Countries around the world may do dumb things

**Conclusion:**
- It’s not going to work this time any better than it did the last time.

### What’s to Be Done?
- **For Developers:**
  - What if you’re a developer facing an order/request/demand/NSL?
- **For Regular People:**
  - What if you’re a regular person?
- **For Those with Questions:**
  - What if you just have some questions?
