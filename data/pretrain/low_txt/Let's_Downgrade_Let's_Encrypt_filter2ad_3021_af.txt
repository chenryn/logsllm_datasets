### Attacks to Obtain Fraudulent Certificates

Our research demonstrates that, despite its apparent simplicity, domain validation remains an unresolved challenge. A critical and intriguing question for future investigation is identifying the conditions and assumptions (regarding network topology, adversary capabilities, etc.) under which domain validation can be made secure.

### BGP Prefix Hijack Attacks Against Domain Validation

In this section, we demonstrate BGP prefix hijack attacks against a single Validation Authority (VA) of Let's Encrypt, which was used until 2020. We begin by explaining and evaluating same-prefix and sub-prefix hijacks using a victim domain set up for this purpose. We assess the effectiveness and efficiency of these attacks on popular router boxes and discuss why they become challenging against the multi-VA domain validation (DV) of Let's Encrypt.

#### A.1 Setup and Attacker Model

##### A.1.1 Attacker Model

Most attackers are not located on the path between the nameservers of a victim domain and the VAs of Let's Encrypt but are off-path to the victims they wish to attack. BGP prefix hijacks enable off-path attackers to become on-path for the communication exchanged with the hijacked prefix. In this section, we show how to apply BGP prefix hijacks to intercept the communication between the nameservers and the VAs when the attacker is off-path and not on the communication path.

Our BGP prefix hijacks are short-lived and aimed at hijacking the DNS packets exchanged between the DNS resolver software at the VAs and the nameservers of victim domains. Short-lived BGP hijacks are common attacks on the Internet [8, 22, 27].

Our attacker model is the same as the one against which Let's Encrypt guarantees security [15]. This is also the attacker model used in [14] to demonstrate the insecurity of a single-node DV. The attacker controls a BGP router and issues BGP announcements to hijack the same-prefix or a sub-prefix of a victim AS in the Internet. We show how the attacker can perform same-prefix and sub-prefix BGP hijacks of the VAs and the nameservers, explain the differences, and the implications of both these hijacks on the traffic intercepted during the interaction with Let's Encrypt.

The attacker sets up a malicious DNS nameserver with a zone file that maps the resources in the victim domain to the IP addresses of the attacker.

- **Victim AS**: A network hosting one or more nameservers of the target domain or the network hosting the VA.
- **Target Domain**: The domain for which the attacker wishes to issue a fraudulent certificate. The target domain has nameservers that serve records from the DNS zone of that domain.
- **Goal**: Hijack the same-prefix or a sub-prefix either of one or more nameservers of the target domain or to hijack the VAs. If the hijack succeeds, the attacker will receive all the traffic destined to the victim AS. To avoid blackholing, the attacker should relay the traffic to the destination. In our attack against Let's Encrypt, the goal is to intercept the DNS queries sent by the VAs or the DNS responses sent by the nameservers. The attacker configures a filter to match the IP addresses of the hijacked AS to catch the target DNS packet. The attacker forwards all the remaining traffic to the legitimate destination.

Next, we explain how our attacker launches sub-prefix hijacks (Figure 12) and same-prefix hijacks (Figure 11) and how it impacts the traffic flow.

#### A.2 Same-Prefix vs. Sub-Prefix BGP Hijack

##### A.2.1 Same-Prefix BGP Hijack

The attacker advertises the same prefix as the victim AS, thereby intercepting traffic from all ASes that have fewer hops (shorter AS-PATH) to the attacker than to the victim AS. Example same-prefix hijack attacks for intercepting a DNS request or a DNS response are illustrated in Figure 11.

**Effectiveness of Same-Prefix Attacks**: The limitation of the same-prefix hijack is that it only affects the traffic of the ASes that prefer the attacker's announcement and does not propagate to all parts of the Internet. Therefore, the effectiveness of the same-prefix hijack attacks depends on the local preferences of the ASes and the location of the attacker's AS. Specifically, the same-prefix attack only attracts traffic from ASes that have a shorter path (i.e., fewer hops) to the attacker. Thus, the closer the attacker is to the victim (i.e., the shorter the AS-PATH is), the more effective the attack is. Consequently, the success of our hijack attack against the multi-VA-based DV of Let's Encrypt depends on the topological relationship between the attacker and the victim.
