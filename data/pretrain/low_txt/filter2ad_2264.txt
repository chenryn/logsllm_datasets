## Abstract
The Second International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems Security and Privacy (CPS-SPC'16) is being held in conjunction with the 23rd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). This second edition follows a successful inaugural workshop held with ACM CCS in 2015. The workshop was motivated by several key observations:

1. **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) as a New Frontier for Cyber Risk:** CPS represent a new frontier for cyber risk due to the convergence of computing, communications, and physical control, presenting unique challenges for security researchers and practitioners.
2. **Immaturity of CPS Security and Privacy Literature:** The majority of published literature addressing the security and privacy of CPS reflects a field still in its infancy, with overall principles, models, and theories yet to be fully developed.
3. **Need for a Premier Forum:** The organizers felt that a premier forum associated with a top-tier conference was necessary to rapidly publish diverse, multidisciplinary work on CPS security and privacy and galvanize the research community.

The accepted papers reflect this vision, and we have organized an exciting program for the workshop, looking forward to active participation in this and future workshops.

**Keywords:** Cyber-Physical Systems, Security, Privacy, Safety, Reliability

## 1. Introduction
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrate computing and communication capabilities with the monitoring and control of entities in the physical world. These systems typically consist of networked agents, including sensors, actuators, control processing units, and communication devices. While some forms of CPS are already in use, the widespread growth of wireless embedded sensors and actuators is creating new applications in areas such as medical devices, automotive, and smart infrastructure. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its interface with control systems further highlights the increasing role of cyber infrastructures in existing control systems and various domains, including the process control industry, power grid, oil and natural gas infrastructure, autonomous vehicle and transportation systems, and medical devices.

Many CPS applications are safety-critical, and their failure can cause irreparable harm to the physical system and the people who depend on it. For example, the protection of critical infrastructures that rely on CPS, such as electric power transmission and distribution, industrial control systems, water and wastewater treatment plants, healthcare devices, and transportation networks, is fundamental to our society. Disruption of these systems can have significant impacts on individuals and nations.

Additionally, many CPS systems collect sensor data non-intrusively, often making users unaware of their exposure. Therefore, in addition to security, CPS systems must be designed with privacy considerations.

The challenges in securing CPS are numerous. Unlike traditional cybersecurity concerns focused on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA), CPS security must be approached from the perspective of how attacks on CIA properties affect control-theoretic properties such as controllability, observability, and stability, and in turn, the impact on overall system reliability and safety.

## 2. Objective and Scope
The objective of the workshop is to become the premier forum for publishing research on CPS security and privacy. Building on the vision set by the first workshop, the second edition invited participation from diverse CPS domains, researchers, and practitioners, encompassing a wide range of topics. Submissions were sought from multiple interdisciplinary backgrounds, including information security, control theory, embedded systems, and human factors. Specifically, the workshop sought contributions in the following areas:

- Mathematical foundations for secure CPS
- Control-theoretic approaches to secure CPS
- Security architectures for CPS
- Security and resilience metrics for CPS
- Metrics and risk assessment approaches for CPS
- Privacy in CPS
- Network security for CPS
- Game theory applied to CPS security
- Security of embedded systems, IoT, and real-time systems in the context of CPS
- Human factors and humans in the loop
- CPS reliability and safety
- Economics of security and privacy in CPS
- Intrusion detection in CPS

CPS domains of interest included, but were not limited to:
- Healthcare and medical devices
- Manufacturing
- Industrial control systems
- SCADA systems
- Robotics
- Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
- Autonomous vehicles
- Transportation systems and networks
- Abstract theoretical CPS domains involving sensing and actuation
