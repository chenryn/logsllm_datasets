When I press the `Alt` key, the "F" in the File menu is underlined, indicating that it should be accessible via the `Alt+F` shortcut. However, when I press `Alt+F`, the command `editor:move-to-end-of-word` is executed instead. Similarly, when I press `Alt+H` to access the Help menu, the command `editor:delete-to-beginning-of-word` is executed.

This conflict only occurs when an editor window has focus. The other menu keyboard shortcuts work as expected. The issue does not occur when all files are closed or no editor window has focus.

I am using Windows.
