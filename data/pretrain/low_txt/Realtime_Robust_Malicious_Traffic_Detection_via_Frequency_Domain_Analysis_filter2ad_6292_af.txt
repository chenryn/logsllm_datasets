### Traffic Classification

Machine learning algorithms are widely used in traffic classification [3, 9, 48, 56â€“59, 61, 66]. For example:
- Web fingerprinting aims to invalidate Tor anonymous services and infer the websites users are visiting using TLS encrypted traffic features [55, 72, 73].
- Ede et al. [66] used semi-supervised learning to fingerprint mobile applications.
- Siby et al. [61] applied traffic analysis to classify encrypted DNS traffic and infer user activities.
- Bahramali et al. [3] analyzed the features of various real-time communication applications.
- Nasr et al. [48] compressed statistical features of traffic for large-scale traffic analysis.
- Zhang et al. [75] proposed a countermeasure against traffic analysis via adversarial examples.

Although traffic classification has a different goal from malicious traffic detection, the frequency domain features extracted in Whisper can be applied to perform traffic classifications.

### Anomaly Detection with Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is an efficient method for training anomaly detection models [18, 30, 60]:
- Jan et al. [30] used Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate labeled datasets for botnet detection.
- Shetty et al. [60] generated paired data using GANs to train a seq2seq model aimed at invalidating text anonymity.
- Fischer et al. [18] solved dataset scalability problems for detecting vulnerable code using Siamese Networks.

In Whisper, we leverage frequency domain features for efficient anomaly detection.

### Throttling Malicious Traffic

IP blacklists are widely used to throttle malicious traffic [36, 50]:
- Ramanathan et al. [54] proposed an IP blacklist aggregation method to locate attackers.
- Programmable data planes [34, 70, 71, 74, 77] have been leveraged to throttle various attack traffic, such as DoS flows and covert channels.

These defenses are complementary to our Whisper system.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we develop Whisper, a real-time malicious traffic detection system that utilizes sequential information of traffic via frequency domain analysis for robust attack detection. The frequency domain features, with bounded information loss, enable both high detection accuracy and high detection throughput. Fine-grained frequency domain features represent the ordering information of packet sequences, ensuring robust detection and preventing evasion. To extract these features, Whisper encodes per-packet feature sequences as vectors and uses Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to extract sequential information in the frequency domain, enabling efficient attack detection with a lightweight clustering algorithm. We prove that the frequency domain features have bounded information loss, which is essential for accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments show that Whisper effectively detects various attacks in high-throughput networks, achieving 0.999 AUC accuracy within 0.06 seconds and around 13.22 Gbps throughput. Even under sophisticated evasion attacks, Whisper maintains high AUC ranging between 0.891 and 0.983.
