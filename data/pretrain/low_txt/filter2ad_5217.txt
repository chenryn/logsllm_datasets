On behalf of the Organizing Committee, it is my pleasure to welcome you to the 2006 International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN-2006). Since its inception in 1971, DSN has been the premier international conference on dependable computing. This year, we are delighted to host the event in the vibrant and historic city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.

Dependability is a critical attribute of computing and communication systems, which are integral to every aspect of our daily lives. As our reliance on these systems grows, so too do concerns about their security and reliability. Malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities, as well as traditional issues such as inadvertent faults, errors, and failures, pose significant challenges. Moreover, the increasing interconnection between communication networks and national infrastructures, such as the electrical power grid, heightens the potential for catastrophic failures. The central theme of this year's conference is to explore how we can enhance the dependability, reliability, and trustworthiness of our systems and networks, thereby ensuring greater safety and security for our businesses, homeland, and society.

We have assembled an outstanding program that includes a keynote address by a distinguished business and technology leader, research papers, industry sessions, panel discussions, tutorials, workshops, fast abstracts, and a student forum. This volume contains the papers and presentations from the DCCS and IPDS tracks, while the accompanying Supplemental volume features presentations from the workshops, the student forum, and Fast Abstracts.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all members of the Organizing Committee for their hard work and dedication, without which this conference would not be possible. Special thanks go to:

- Sachin Garg and Navjot Singh, who have gone above and beyond their roles to support the organization of this conference from the very beginning.
- David Taylor, Lorenzo Alvisi, and Aad van Moorsel for coordinating and delivering an exceptional technical program.
- The DSN Steering Committee, including Chair Jay Lala, Vice Chair Rick Schlichting, and members Jean Arlat, Ravi Iyer, Takashi Nanya, Bill Sanders, Neeraj Suri, Kishor Trivedi, Paulo Verissimo, and Chuck Weinstock, for their invaluable guidance.

I hope you will find your participation in DSN 2006 both enjoyable and productive.

Finally, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to our industrial sponsors for their generous financial support, especially during these challenging economic times.
