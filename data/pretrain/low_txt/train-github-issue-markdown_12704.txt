When renaming a file in the File Explorer, the interface turns gray. After pressing ENTER to confirm the new name, the File Explorer view (file names) remains gray instead of reverting to its normal white background. This issue appears to occur randomly. The working files view, however, functions as expected.

Here is a screenshot illustrating the problem:
