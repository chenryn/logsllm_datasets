### They would apply the same care to choose blacklists used by BLAG

BLAG ensures that any polluted information is less likely to propagate compared to individual blacklists. An attacker would need to carefully craft a polluted blacklist so that the servers appear on the same list as many malicious sources, and their appearances do not resemble those of known legitimate sources on the Master Blacklist (MB). Otherwise, BLAG would be able to identify and discard low-quality information. The exact handling of pollution attempts will be addressed in our future work.

### X. CONCLUSION

Blacklists are widely used by network operators, but they often miss many attacks. We have proposed BLAG, a system that can identify high-quality pieces of information from multiple blacklists and aggregate them into a master blacklist, with some IP addresses expanded into /24 prefixes. Such a master blacklist could be useful for an emergency response to novel or large-scale attacks. Overall, BLAG has higher recall than any single blacklist or their naïve aggregation and maintains 95–99% specificity. BLAG also outperforms PRESTA+L, a competing approach, by achieving higher specificity for the same recall. We believe that BLAG could significantly improve network security and produce higher-quality blacklists than existing approaches.
