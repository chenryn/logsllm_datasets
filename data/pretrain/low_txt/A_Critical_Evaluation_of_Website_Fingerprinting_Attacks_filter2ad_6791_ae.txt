### Study of Variables and Their Impact on System Accuracy

We examined several variables in isolation, including website variance over time, multitab browsing behavior, Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) version, Internet connection type, and the open-world assumption. When any of these assumptions are violated, the system's accuracy drops significantly. We have not yet thoroughly investigated how the accuracy is affected when multiple assumptions are simultaneously violated.

### Factors Affecting Website Fingerprinting (WF) Adversary Success

Our results indicate that the success of a WF adversary depends on various factors, such as the temporal proximity of training and testing traces, the TBB versions used for training and testing, and users' browsing habits. These factors are often oversimplified in existing WF models. Consequently, for most cases, it appears that non-targeted attacks are not feasible given the current sophistication level of such attacks.

There may be exceptions, particularly for unique and stable sites, such as whistleblowing platforms. Even in targeted attacks, the adversary must accurately observe or guess the user's behavior to pose a significant threat. Some users may be more susceptible to these attacks than others. In such cases, an adversary with sufficient background knowledge could mount a more targeted attack, thereby reducing the false positive rate, which we empirically demonstrated to be critical for the success of the WF adversary.

### Future Research Directions

Further research is needed to evaluate the common assumptions in the WF literature to better assess the practicality and efficacy of WF attacks. Future work on developing WF attacks against Tor should also test their proposed methods in real-world scenarios. This would provide the Tor community and researchers with a more realistic assessment of the threats they face.
