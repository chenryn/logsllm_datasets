### Analysis of Network Performance and Service Availability in Cuba

#### Traceroute Analysis

For each Namehelp user in our dataset, we observed that all traceroutes launched by this probe and targeting the IP addresses of Namehelp users would exit the country via either Tata's or Telefonica's network, thereby avoiding high-latency satellite connections. However, the reverse path (into Cuba) was not as consistent.

For each traceroute measurement from Namehelp, we identified the last Autonomous System (AS) hop before entering the Cuban Internet Exchange Point (IXP) network (AS11960). We then calculated the approximate distance between the Namehelp user and the Atlas node using MaxMind’s GeoIP database to map users’ IP addresses to geographic locations. Finally, we grouped the measurements according to the last AS seen before entering Cuba.

**Figure 5** shows the relationship between Round-Trip Time (RTT) and distance, grouped by the last AS before entering Cuba. The gray dotted line represents the RTT of light moving through a cable of length \( x \) (assuming light travels at \( c/2 \) in the medium). The green dashed line represents the linear regression between distance and latency for each group of vantage points. Below each figure, we include the equation of the linear regression. We found that the slope of the linear regression for measurements traveling through satellite networks is similar to that of the measurements traversing the submarine cable, but the RTT is approximately 180 ms higher.

Despite the fact that approximately 40% of the Earth’s surface should be able to communicate directly with satellites in geostationary orbit, we were unable to find any satellite base stations outside of North America in either of the satellite networks. As a result, packets headed to Cuba had to first be routed to North America and then to Cuba over a satellite connection. For example, packets originating in Europe had to first traverse an intercontinental submarine cable before traversing a satellite link, even though some countries should be within the satellite’s serviceable area. The slopes of the linear regression lines are thus roughly consistent across each group of users, and similar to the slope of the estimated speed of light through a fiber cable. The difference in the y-intercept of the regression lines in **Figures 5a and 5b** when compared to **Figures 5c and 5d** is a result of traversing a satellite link.

We also looked for trends between the origin of the traceroute measurement and which network was used to reach Cuba. We found that RTT could vary widely between countries, even those in the same region, due to differences in routing. In some cases, vantage points that were in countries much further away from Cuba (e.g., in Europe) would have significantly lower RTTs than those in North and South America.

**Figure 6** shows the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of RTTs for users in France, Spain, the US, the UK, and Venezuela. Latency measurements from Namehelp users in France and Spain had the lowest median latencies of all subpopulations in our dataset, nearly half that of the median latency of users in the UK. Despite the fact that users in the US and Venezuela are much closer to Cuba, their RTTs were much higher. This difference is due to the fact that most users in France and Spain are routed to Cuba through Telefonica’s transit network and sent via the ALBA-1 submarine cable instead of satellite networks. In total, 77% of routes to Cuba from France and 94% of routes from Spain were routed over the ALBA-1 submarine cable in both directions.

In contrast to previously reported networking performance issues in developing countries, such as Ghana [20] and Zambia [21], Cuba presents an interesting case in that at least part of the performance issues can be attributed to asymmetric routing and could be addressed via changes to routing policy.

#### Network Service Availability

We also surveyed a number of popular network services and websites, checking their availability in Cuba. To test website availability, we issued SSL certificate requests from our set of 50 Atlas probes in North and South America to 4,434 domains supporting HTTPS from the top 10,000 most popular websites. While we would have liked to test the availability of any website, the RIPE Atlas API does not support general HTTP tests. For every site, if the request succeeded (replied with a valid certificate), we removed it from our list. If the request failed, we tried four more times before labeling the site as “unavailable.” The experiment ran between August 31st and September 4th, 2015.

We found that, while most of the sites replied with a valid certificate, requests from the Atlas probe in Cuba timed out consistently across all five tests for 111 (2.5%) of sites. Nearly every other Atlas probe was able to successfully retrieve a valid SSL certificate from these domains. Most of the “unavailable” websites in Cuba fall into a few categories, such as finance-related (e.g., paypal.com, bankofamerica.com, capitalone.com, and usbank.com), ad networks (e.g., adcash.com, adnetworkperformance.com, and tradeadexchange.com), computer hardware (e.g., dell.com and seagate.com), and adult content. A few of these sites were registered by the same entity but provided different services or different Top-Level Domains (TLDs) (e.g., capitalone.com and capitaloneinvesting.com, blizzard.com and battle.net, and the multiple TLDs of cam4.com), hinting at a parent company policy. **Table 2** lists the percentage of websites per category, along with a few examples.

We also found that many of the same sites we labeled as unavailable in Cuba also timed out when requested from Atlas probes in other US-sanctioned countries. Specifically, 51 of the 111 (46%) domains timed out when requests originated from a probe in Sudan.

Beyond websites, we surveyed the availability of public DNS services in Cuba and found all of those tested to be reachable. A first analysis showed that some services appeared to be unavailable; however, this was due to the Recursion Desired (RD) flag of the request being unset by default in the Atlas probe, while many DNS servers are configured to ignore requests with RD unset or respond with an empty answer. We diagnosed the issue by comparing our results with those of `dig`, which sets RD by default.

#### Conclusion

We have started to characterize the state of Cuba’s access to the wider Internet. Our work is motivated by recent improvements in connectivity to the island and the growing commercial interest following the easing of restrictions on travel and trade with the US. This paper reports on some of our early findings, including high RTTs to websites hosted off the island, even after the addition of ALBA-1, a high degree of path asymmetry in traffic to/from the island that partially traverses high-latency satellite links, and several web services that return invalid responses to requests originating from the island. We plan to make periodic status reports on the state of the Internet in Cuba and the associated data available to the research community.
