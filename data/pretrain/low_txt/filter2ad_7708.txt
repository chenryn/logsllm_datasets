## Abstract
This paper investigates the robustness of mobile device fingerprinting and explores whether mobile users can evade modern web-tracking mechanisms. We examine the current state of web-based fingerprinting for both desktop and mobile devices, and we conduct a field study with over 15,000 client systems to compare the information value of classical features. Our findings suggest that while existing methods are not suitable for mobile devices, techniques will evolve, and mobile users may find it challenging to evade fingerprinting.

## Introduction
### What is Fingerprinting?
Fingerprinting involves recognizing or identifying a device by extracting characteristic attributes (features) and combining them into a unique vector, known as a fingerprint. The most discriminant features are used to recognize or identify a device, which has applications in fraud detection, user tracking, and more.

### Fingerprinting as a Privacy Issue
While there are legitimate use cases for fingerprinting, it often extends beyond the device to include the user's location, accounts, browsing history, shopping preferences, and activities. This raises significant privacy concerns.

## Status Quo
### Web-Based Fingerprinting
- **Personal Computers/Browsers:**
  - Highly customizable
  - Multiple browsers
  - Many plugins
  - Custom fonts
- **Mobile Devices:**
  - Highly standardized
  - Single browser
  - No plugins
  - Standard fonts

### Previous Research
- **Web-Based Fingerprinting:**
  - "Cookie-less Monster" (Nikiforakis et al.)
  - "How Unique is Your Web Browser?" (Eckersley)
  - "Pixel Perfect: Fingerprinting Canvas in HTML5" (Mowery et al.)
  - "FPDetective: Dusting the web for fingerprinters" (Piessens et al.)
  - "Pixel perfect timing attacks with HTML5" (Stone)

### Mobile Devices
- Are previous insights transferable to the mobile world?
- Are mobile devices fingerprintable?

## Field Study
We conducted a field study with over 15,000 client systems, including a subset of desktops and mobiles, to compare the information value of classical features.

## Aiming for Mobiles
### Existing Methods
- Current methods are not suitable for mobile devices.
- Techniques will evolve, and there may be a dedicated fingerprinting system for mobiles.
- Can users evade such a system?

### Online Test
- **Publicly Available Fingerprinting Website:**
  - 45 features
  - 724 participants
  - 459 re-visitors

### Recognition Experiments
- **Requirements:**
  - Recognize a revisiting device by its fingerprint (match).
  - Distinguish a never-seen device from all known devices (reject).

### Testing Robustness
- Determine the precision of recognition of mobile devices.
- Progressively remove the most discriminant features from the feature set.
- Repeat the recognition test with a smaller feature set.

### Scenarios
1. All features
2. No cookies
3. No cookies, no local storage, and no host information
4. No cookies, no local storage, no host information, and no IP address

### Iteration Types
- **Single Iteration:**
  - All devices (and their features) are available immediately.
  - Recognition performs well even without top features.
- **Multi Iteration:**
  - Devices are available one after the other (in random order).
  - Simulates an evolving system.
  - Recognition still good, but top features are relevant.

### Evasion
- Tracking mobile devices is feasible and realistic.
- Cookies are obsolete; device attributes are sufficient for recognition.
- Can users evade fingerprint-based tracking?

### Changeability of Features
- Some attributes can be easily changed by the user.
- Some attributes change depending on the environment.
- Some features cannot be influenced easily.

### Scenarios
- An evader needs to know:
  - Which attributes are inquired for fingerprinting.
  - When these attributes are inquired.
- **Scenarios:**
  - Use a second browser alternately.
  - Use a second browser with different settings.
  - Use a proxy connection.
  - Combination: Two browsers and proxy.

### Observations
- Browser change is useless.
- Proxy connection is useless.
- Changing settings is effective.
- Combination is the best approach.

### Feasibility
- Strong preconditions are required.
- Knowledge about the fingerprinting system is needed.
- Simple countermeasures (using another browser or a proxy) fail.
- Successful evasion requires a high effort (using browsers with different settings and a proxy).
- Evasion is possible but neither pleasant nor easy.

### Randomness
- Emerging approach: Adding randomness to features.
- Drawbacks:
  - Cannot change all device attributes.
  - Attributes are also used by legitimate functions.
  - Differentiating between "good" and "bad" functions is challenging.
- Legitimate use cases for fingerprinting exist.

## Conclusion
- Tracking libraries do not currently target mobile devices.
- Tracking techniques will evolve.
- Mobile web users are not safe from fingerprinting and tracking.
- Mobile devices provide sufficient characteristics for fingerprinting.
- Evading fingerprinting is hard to achieve.
- Specific knowledge about the fingerprinting system is required.
- Not all attributes are within the user's sphere of influence.
- Randomizers, blockers, and obfuscators need to discern fingerprinters.
