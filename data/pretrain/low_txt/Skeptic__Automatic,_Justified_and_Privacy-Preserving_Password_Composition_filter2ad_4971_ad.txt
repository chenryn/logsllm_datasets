### 4. Correlation with Empirical Studies

#### 4.1. Correlation with Weir et al. [36]

Skeptic generates α-values that strongly correlate with the percentage of passwords guessed by Weir et al. [36] in proportional, extraneous, and null reselection modes (see Table 7). The α-values for the LinkedIn dataset under each policy and macrobehavior are plotted against the percentages of passwords cracked by Weir et al. [36] in Figure 14.

In convergent reselection mode, Skeptic's accuracy is significantly lower for the Yahoo and LinkedIn datasets but retains a strong correlation for the RockYou dataset. This discrepancy is likely due to dataset-specific reasons, as discussed in Section 5.2, and is more pronounced because the same dataset was used in both studies.

**Findings:**
- Skeptic produces α-values and policy rankings that are very strongly correlated with the results obtained by Weir et al. [36] from large sets of revealed password data.
- In convergent reselection mode, Skeptic's accuracy varies across datasets, with the RockYou dataset showing the strongest correlation.

#### 4.2. Correlation with Shay et al. [31]

Figure 13 shows the percentage of passwords cracked by Shay et al. [31] at 10^6 guesses against the α-values yielded by Skeptic for the LinkedIn dataset in each reselection mode. The net increase in the uniformity of the password distribution on the system suggests that stricter password composition policies generally lead to increased resistance to password guessing attacks.

Notably, the outlying ρ values for the convergent macrobehavior on the RockYou dataset (see Tables 4 and 5) indicate that user password reselection behavior for this dataset more closely resembles the convergent macrobehavior. This may be due to the age of the dataset (2009 vs. 2012) and the less secure password reselection behaviors of its users. The RockYou dataset, being an online gaming service, may have had a higher proportion of younger users who are less adept at picking secure passwords or who place less value on their accounts compared to professional or social networking sites like LinkedIn or Yahoo Voice.

**Findings:**
- Skeptic produces α-values and password composition policy rankings that are strongly correlated with the results obtained by Shay et al. [31] from real human users recruited to create passwords under various policies.
- This correlation is particularly strong for larger attack magnitudes (e.g., offline attacks) and weaker for smaller, online-range attacks, which are more sensitive to specific password distributions.
- Skeptic's uniformity-based methodology is an accurate measure of general resistance to password guessing attacks but is less effective for specific, targeted attacks tailored to a particular password distribution.

### 5. Replication of Results: Weir et al. [36]

We next examine a study by Weir et al. [36], which uses leaked password datasets to determine the effectiveness of different password composition policies. The percentage of passwords cracked at 5×10^4 guesses by Weir et al. [36] is plotted against the α-values yielded by Skeptic for the LinkedIn dataset in each reselection mode in Figure 14.

**Findings:**
- Skeptic's α-values and policy rankings are strongly correlated with the results from Weir et al. [36].
- The correlation is consistent across different reselection modes, with some variations in accuracy depending on the dataset.

### 6. Policy Ranking

To make an informed choice of password composition policy, we can rank candidate policies from most to least secure. Pyrrho (see Section 4.2) enables this ranking, but manual extraction of α-values and additional processing in spreadsheet software introduce a high potential for human error. The Pacpal DSL automates this process, reducing the risk of errors and the need for additional data processing (see Figure 11).

Table 8 shows the rankings obtained using Pacpal for the 28 policies investigated in this work, ranked according to their α-values given by Skeptic in proportional reselection mode for each of the three datasets studied. Crucially, these rankings do not require access to the password data itself, thus avoiding ethical issues while retaining the ability to justify and reproduce the rankings as needed. The necessary Pacpal scripts and equation files are freely available [5].

**Findings:**
- It is possible to use the Skeptic toolchain to inform password composition policy choice.
- Using the Pacpal DSL, this can be done without any additional manual data processing steps.

### 7. Policy Immunity

In this section, we demonstrate the utility of encoding password composition policies in the Coq proof assistant using Authority (see Section 4.1) by formally verifying the immunity or vulnerability of 14 password composition policies to the password guessing attacks used by the Mirai and Conficker botnet worms.

#### 7.1. Mirai

Mirai is malware that targets network-enabled devices running Linux, recruiting them into a botnet used in DDoS attacks [23]. To propagate, Mirai scans IP address ranges for devices with Telnet enabled and tries a dictionary of 62 username/password combinations. Using Coq, we modeled the attack and determined whether the password composition policies by Shay et al. [31] render a device immune to Mirai when enforced by prohibiting the creation of any vulnerable password. The results are shown in Table 9.

**Findings:**
- Policies such as basic14, basic16, and basic20 provide immunity to the Mirai worm.
- These results would be useful to companies producing Linux-based network-enabled devices, ensuring their products cannot be configured to become vulnerable.

#### 7.2. Conficker

Conficker, another botnet worm, emerged in 2008 and remains a threat through its use of a dictionary attack on password-protected administrative shares on Windows systems. The dictionary used by Conficker contains 182 passwords. By encoding our password composition policies in Coq, we determined whether each policy confers immunity against this attack. The results are shown in Table 10.

**Findings:**
- Policies immune to Mirai are also immune to Conficker.
- Researchers can use Skeptic to discover policies immune to a wide range of malware.

### 8. Conclusion

In this work, we have demonstrated a new methodology for automatically, rigorously, and justifiably selecting the most appropriate password composition policy from a list of candidates. We achieve this by using a user behavior model and password composition policy to induce changes in password probability distributions derived from large leaked password databases. The uniformity of these distributions serves as a proxy for security, and we have validated this approach by reproducing results from two previous studies [31, 36].

Our approach is attack-independent and broadly applicable, assuming that attackers guess more common passwords first. However, it has limitations in accurately reasoning about attacks specifically tailored to target a particular system.

We have also described and presented Skeptic, a software toolchain consisting of:
- **Authority:** A metaprogramming utility for encoding policies in arbitrary representations.
- **Pyrrho:** A user behavior model to redistribute probability according to these policies under different assumptions about user password reselection behavior.
- **Pacpal:** A straightforward DSL to make the results of this process accessible to professionals in the field.

Using this tool, we have obtained new results, including:
- A ranking of all 28 password composition policies studied in this work according to their expected effectiveness at mitigating password guessing attacks.
- A demonstration that certain password composition policies can have a negative effect on password security under some user behavior models.
- Formal verification of the immunity of some password composition policies to the password guessing attacks employed by the Mirai and Conficker malware.

### 8.1. Future Work

We are excited about the future of this project, with potential research directions including:
- Designing machine learning-based user behavior models for password reselection.
- Expanding the capabilities of Pacpal to increase its utility.
- Exploring the possibility of employing the power-law equations fitted by Pyrrho in conjunction with existing password strength estimation algorithms to estimate the success probability of concrete password guessing attacks.
- Devising tools and techniques to synthesize formally verified password composition policy enforcement software from models of password guessing attacks, informed by policy rankings produced by Skeptic.
- Developing a user-friendly software interface for non-expert users to interact with Skeptic and its satellite tooling, as part of the Passlab project [20].
