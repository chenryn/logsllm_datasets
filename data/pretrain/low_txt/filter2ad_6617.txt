# PLAS'20: 15th Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security

**Authors:**

## Abstract
The 15th ACM SIGSAC Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security (PLAS 2020) is co-located with the 27th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2020). Over its more than ten-year history, PLAS has provided a unique forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas on programming language and program analysis techniques aimed at improving the security of software systems. The workshop strongly encourages proposals of new, speculative ideas, evaluations of new or known techniques in practical settings, and discussions of emerging threats and important problems.

## CCS Concepts
- **Security and Privacy:** Software and application security

## Keywords
- Programming languages
- Security

## 1. Introduction
PLAS aims to provide a forum for exploring and evaluating ideas on the use of programming language and program analysis techniques to enhance the security of software systems. We particularly encourage submissions that propose new, speculative ideas, evaluate new or known techniques in practical settings, and discuss emerging threats and significant challenges. Position papers that are radical, forward-looking, and likely to lead to lively and insightful discussions influencing future research at the intersection of programming languages and security are especially welcome.

## 2. Scope
The scope of PLAS includes, but is not limited to:
- Program (binary) analysis and fuzzing.
- Application of programming language techniques and verification to security in other domains (e.g., adversarial learning and smart contracts).
- Software isolation techniques (e.g., SFI and sandboxing) and compiler-based hardening techniques (e.g., secure compilation).
- Compiler-based security mechanisms (e.g., security type systems) and runtime-based security mechanisms (e.g., inline reference monitors).
- Techniques for discovering and detecting security vulnerabilities.
- Automated introduction and/or verification of security enforcement mechanisms.
- Language-based verification of security properties in software, including cryptographic protocol verification.
- Specifying and enforcing security policies for information flow and access control.
- Model-driven approaches to security.
- Security concerns for web programming languages.
- Language design for security in new domains such as cloud computing and IoT.
- Applications, case studies, and implementations of these techniques.

## 3. Workshop Format
This year, PLAS received high-quality submissions, attesting to the continued vitality of the community whose work lies at the intersection of programming languages and security. PLAS 2020 welcomed both long research papers and short papers presenting preliminary or exploratory work intended to generate lively discussions at the workshop. The workshop attracted twelve submissions, seven of which were short papers, from seven countries (Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, USA), with authors spanning both academia and industry. The submissions covered a variety of topics, including type systems for security languages and smart contracts, runtime monitoring of security protocols, secure multiparty logic programming, oblivious computations and data structures, and program synthesis of checksum algorithms.

## 6. Workshop Organisers
- **Alley Stoughton (PC Co-chair)**: Research professor at Boston University with a background in programming language theory. Her recent focus has been on applying formal methods to security, particularly in language-based security and using the EasyCrypt proof assistant to prove the security of cryptographic schemes and protocols. She has published in and served on the program committees of CCS and CSF, and has reviewed for the Journal of Cryptology.
- **Marco Vassena (PC Co-chair)**: Postdoctoral researcher at CISPA, Helmholtz Center for Information Security, and a member of the CISPA-Stanford Center for Cybersecurity. His research interests lie at the intersection of security and programming languages, focusing on applying principled programming language techniques (e.g., information-flow control and secure compilation) to the design and implementation of secure software systems. He has published in prestigious security and programming languages conferences and received a distinguished paper award from POPL 2019. He has served on the program committees of various workshops (PriSC, FCS, PLAS) and as a reviewer for ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security (TOPS) and Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS).
