### How to Get Your Message Out
**Presenter: Bruce Sutherland - KO4IN**
**Event: DEFCON 19**
**Topic: When Your Government Turns Off The Internet**

#### About the Presenter
- **Bruce Sutherland (KO4IN)**
  - Over 20 years of experience in the Information Systems field.
  - Designed and implemented networks since ARCNet was standard.
  - Professional coder for over 15 years.
  - Licensed Ham Radio operator for 8+ years.
  - Prefers UNIX-like operating systems over Microsoft products.
  - Strongly opposes government interference.

#### Introduction to Ham Radio
- **Overview**
  - Ham radio is an old technology, dating back to around 1900.
  - Requires at least two skilled operators at either end.
  - Typically needs favorable ionosphere conditions.
  - Alternatively, modern digital protocols can be used.

#### Cost of Equipment
- **Basic Setup**
  - Yaesu VX-8R Handheld Transceiver: ~$350.00
  - Handheld Yagi Antenna: ~$50.00

- **Advanced Setup**
  - A high-end station: ~$10,000.00

#### Obtaining a Ham Radio License
- **Requirements**
  - Easy for anyone with basic technical knowledge.
  - Only a Technician class license is needed for the activities discussed in this talk.
  - Study the ARRL (arrl.org) study guide.
  - Memorizing the test online is not recommended.
  - Take the test (check arrl.org for times and locations).
  - Wait for the FCC to post your license record.
  - Once a call sign is assigned, you are ready to go.

#### Technologies We Will Use
- **VHF Band (144 MHz – 148 MHz)**
  - Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS)
  - Handheld transceiver (any APRS-enabled device)
  - Portable Yagi antenna (preferred)
  - Amateur radio satellites (e.g., ISS, PC-SAT, HOPE-1, ARISSat-1)

#### About APRS (aprs.org)
- **Overview**
  - Developed in the late 1980s by Bob Bruninga, WB4APR.
  - Real-time tactical digital protocol using AX.25.
  - Shares position and ID (call sign) information among a large number of local stations.
  - Digipeaters enable sharing over wide areas.
  - Traffic is routed to the internet via IGate.

#### Other Necessary Infrastructure
- **Twitter**
- **IGate in another country**
- **APRS to Twitter Gateway**

#### Sending Messages via Satellite
- **Setup**
  - Add “ARISS” to the “DIGIPATH” field of the radio.
  - Compose your Twitter message as follows: `:TWITR:`
  - Wait until both you and an IGate are within the satellite’s footprint.
  - Send the message.

#### Available Satellites
- **Examples**
  - International Space Station (ISS)
  - PC-SAT (Navy OSCAR-44)
  - HOPE-1 (Chinese satellite, currently non-functional)
  - ARISSat-1 (launched Summer 2011)
  - Check AMSAT’s Operational OSCAR Satellite Status summary at [AMSAT](http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/status.php).

#### Satellite Pass Prediction
- **Tools**
  - [N2YO](www.n2yo.com) - Web-based (free)
  - Satscape - Java-based local install (free)
  - [AMSAT pass predictions](http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/tools/predict/) (free and simple)

#### Use Cases
- **Countries**
  - Libya
  - Egypt
  - Syria
  - USA?

#### Limitations and Risks
- **Detection**
  - You can be detected.
- **Jamming**
  - You can be jammed.
- **ECM Pod**
  - Internet links can go down.
- **Missed Opportunities**
  - You can miss the satellite.
- **Service Outages**
  - Twitter has its own downtime issues (e.g., "Fail Whale").
