## Abstract

Trusted computing is essential for evaluating the integrity of other parties and ensuring desired security assurance, especially in large-scale and heterogeneous computing environments. Building on the success from 2006 to 2011, the seventh ACM Workshop on Scalable Trusted Computing continues to serve as a forum for researchers and practitioners to disseminate and discuss recent advances and emerging issues. This proceedings includes selected papers focusing on system architectures, enabling mechanisms, and novel applications of trusted computing.

## 1. Background and Motivation

Trusted computing (TC) techniques aim to provide systematic protection and verifiable evidence of the integrity of a computing platform. Software-based trusted computing systems have been studied for decades, including trusted operating systems, database systems, and middleware. However, the security research community has recognized that software-only solutions cannot provide a high degree of trust due to the numerous avenues for software-based attacks in various systems.

Led by hardware vendors, the industry began to develop security-strengthened trusted hardware. The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) and its predecessor, the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA), developed specifications for a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to provide a hardware root of trust for various purposes on client computers. Processor vendors also developed hardware-based virtualization technologies, such as Intel LaGrande Technology (LT) and Trusted Execution Technology (TXT), AMD Pacifica Technology, and ARM TrustZone, which provide fundamental trusted platform mechanisms, including memory curtaining, trusted I/O paths, and additional ring privileges beyond the existing ring 0.

By leveraging these advanced processor capabilities, TPM-enabled systems offer new application-level integrity protection mechanisms, such as protected code execution environments, sealed data storage, and remote attestation.

Recent years have seen significant progress in TC techniques, such as the Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) based on TPM specifications, small trusted computing bases (TCBs) for runtime execution with dynamic roots of trust and chip-based virtualization, and privacy-enhanced remote attestation protocols. TCG-compliant products have been developed and deployed in various aspects of the IT industry, including TPMs in nearly all PCs and notebooks, Trusted Network Connect (TNC) products for enterprises, and disk encryption techniques like Microsoft BitLocker.

However, in a society increasingly dependent on networked and outsourced information systems, several fundamental issues remain unaddressed, such as dynamic integrity measurement in application runtime environments and efficient remote attestation for power-constrained devices. Additionally, emerging computing systems like mobile platforms (e.g., smartphones), cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) introduce new challenges for efficient, scalable, and manageable trusted computing.

## 2. Call for Papers

The ACM Workshop on Scalable Trusted Computing (STC) aims to provide a platform for cutting-edge trusted computing technologies and applications. It serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners to disseminate and discuss recent advances and emerging issues. Following the tradition of STC, STC 2012 was held in conjunction with ACM CCS 2012 on Monday, October 15, 2012, at the Sheraton Raleigh Hotel, Raleigh, NC, USA.

The workshop solicited two types of original papers: full papers and short/work-in-progress/position papers, on the following (but not limited to) topics:

- Security policies and models of trusted computing
- Architecture and implementation technologies
- Limitations, alternatives, and trade-offs
- Trusted computing in cloud and data center
- Cloud-based attestation services
- Trusted smartphone devices and systems
- Trust in smart grids, energy, and the Internet of Things
- Trusted emerging and future internet infrastructure
- Trusted online social networks
- Trust in authentications, users, and computing services
- Hardware-based trusted computing
- Software-based trusted computing
- Pros and cons of hardware-based approaches
- Remote attestation of trusted devices
- Censorship-freeness in trusted computing
- Cryptographic support in trusted computing
- Case studies in trusted computing
- Principles for handling scales
- Scalable trust supports and services in cloud
- Trusted embedded computing and systems
- Virtualization and trusted computing

## 3. Technical Program

The program committee included active researchers from academia and industry in seven countries. We received 14 submissions from 10 different countries, each of which was reviewed by four PC members. Among them, five full papers and three short papers were accepted for presentation, along with one invited paper.

The program consisted of presentations of research papers and invited talks. The research papers were organized into the following three technical sessions:

### Trusted Computing Architecture

This session focused on designing and building trusted computing architectures and frameworks to provide various security facilities or services. The following papers were presented:

- **Secure Processor Architecture for Encrypted Computation on Untrusted Programs** by Christopher Fletcher, Marten van Dijk, and Srini Devadas. This paper describes a processor architecture for untrusted programs to run on encrypted data.
- **Enforcing User-Space Privilege Separation with Declarative Architectures** by Ben Niu and Gang Tan. This paper describes an approach to run a single binary process with multiple protection domains, with different privileges and controlled inter-domain communications.
- **JMF: Java Measurement Framework** by Mark Thober, J. Aaron Pendergrass, and Andrew Jurik. This paper presents a framework for measuring the runtime integrity of Java bytecodes.

### Trusted Computing Applications

Papers in this session proposed novel applications using cutting-edge trusted computing techniques. The following papers were accepted:

- **BottleCap: A Credential Manager for Capability Systems** by Justin King-Lacroix and Andrew Martin. This paper describes the design and implementation of BottleCap, a capability container based on Flicker and TPM.
- **Securing Mobile Agents for Crisis Management Support** by Daniel Hein, Ronald Toegl, Martin Pirker, Emil Gatial, Zoltán Balogh, Hans Brandl, and Ladislav Hluchý. This paper presents a use case for secure mobile agents to be used for crisis management support.
- **Using Trustworthy Host-Based Information in the Network** by Bryan Parno, Zongwei Zhou, and Adrian Perrig. This invited paper describes a system called Assayer, which provides trusted host-based data in a network with a balance between useful data and user privacy.

### Trusted Systems

This session included papers on building new security schemes in distributed systems and cloud computing:

- **Targeted and Scalable Information Dissemination in a Distributed Reputation System** by Rahim Delaviz, Johan Pouwelse, and Dick Epema. This paper proposes two methods to compute peer similarity for reputation evaluation in peer-to-peer networks.
- **SybilControl: Practical Sybil Defense with Computational Puzzles** by Frank Li, Prateek Mittal, Matthew Caesar, and Nikita Borisov. This paper describes a mechanism to protect against Sybil attacks in a DHT using computational puzzles.
- **Auditing Cloud Management Using Information Flow Control** by Afshar Ganjali and David Lie. This paper introduces an auditing platform for cloud computing called H-one, which logs the flow of information between guest VMs and administrator’s processes.

The technical program also included two keynote talks. More detailed information about the invited speakers and abstracts can be found on the STC 2012 website: http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~acmstc/stc2012/.
