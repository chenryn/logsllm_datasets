**ATT&CK ID:** T0866  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Exploitation of Remote Services

Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities to take advantage of programming errors in applications, services, or the operating system kernel. This exploitation can enable remote service abuse. A common objective for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is to gain initial access to and facilitate lateral movement within the ICS (Industrial Control System) environment, thereby enabling access to targeted systems.
