### Recovery from Previous Failures in the Time Slot

In scenarios where a system has recovered from previous failures, it is possible that a new backup set with lower communication costs becomes available. The system then needs to decide whether to reconfigure. In the IATP (Incremental Adjustment With Thresholds Policy) policy, this decision is based on a predefined threshold. The process is as follows:

1. **Determine the Optimal Backup Set**: The system first identifies the statically optimal backup set, denoted by \(\bar{S}_{t+1}^A\), which incurs the minimum communication cost. This is done using the algorithms described in Section 4, based on the current set of active candidate content servers.
2. **Calculate the Cost Ratio**: The system calculates the ratio of the communication cost of the current backup set \(S_t^A\) to that of the new optimal backup set \(\bar{S}_{t+1}^A\).
3. **Decision Based on Threshold**: If the calculated ratio exceeds a threshold \(\psi\) (where \(\psi \geq 1\)), the system reconfigures to the new backup set \(\bar{S}_{t+1}^A\). Otherwise, it retains the current backup set \(S_{t+1}^A = S_t^A\).

The threshold \(\psi\) serves as a tunable parameter for the policy. A higher value of \(\psi\) makes the policy less aggressive, leading to more communication costs but fewer reconfiguration costs. The choice of \(\psi\) is influenced by the weighting factor \(\beta\). It is worth noting that the ECP (Eager Change Policy) is a special case of IATP where \(\psi\) is set to 1.

### Impact of the Threshold \(\psi\)

Figure 7 illustrates how the communication and reconfiguration costs are affected by the threshold \(\psi\) when the IATP policy is adopted. The experiment parameters are the same as those used in Figure 6. The figure shows that as \(\psi\) increases, the communication cost increases while the reconfiguration cost decreases. The reconfiguration cost is more sensitive to changes in \(\psi\) than the communication cost.

This behavior can be attributed to the "adding-only" nature of IATP when computing new backup sets in Case 2. As observed in Section 4, many nodes in the backup set are in the vicinity of \(N_A\). Reusing these nodes in the new backup set reduces the reconfiguration cost without significantly increasing the communication cost.

Figure 8 further demonstrates how the overall cost is affected by \(\psi\) under different values of the weighting factor \(\beta\). For small \(\beta\) (e.g., Figure 8a), ECP, which is a special case of IATP with \(\psi = 1\), is the most effective policy. However, for other values of \(\beta\) (e.g., Figures 8b-8d), IATP provides the flexibility to find a better dynamic reconfiguration policy. The optimal value of \(\psi\) depends on \(\beta\), with higher \(\beta\) generally requiring a higher \(\psi\).

### Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we addressed the problem of selecting cost-effective replication locations in content resiliency service networks, considering both correlated and independent failures. We proposed a general approach to model correlated failures in a representable, quantifiable, and consistent manner, and applied this approach to model geographically correlated failures in content resiliency services. Using these failure models, we formulated the problem of selecting cost-effective replication locations and developed two types of algorithms: a branch-and-bound algorithm capable of finding real optimal solutions for up to 30 servers, and heuristic-based algorithms for large-scale problems that generate high-quality solutions efficiently.

For dynamic reconfiguration of replication locations, we studied policies to minimize the long-term overall prevention cost, including both communication and reconfiguration costs. We first examined the ECP, revealing its limitations, and then proposed the IATP, which allows for trade-offs between communication and reconfiguration costs through a tunable threshold \(\psi\).
