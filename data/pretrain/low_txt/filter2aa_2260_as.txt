### Portland Urban Area Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP)

#### Summary
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Intermediate Implementation

The Portland Urban Area (UA) TICP represents the first formal, regionwide interoperable communications Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the area. Prior to the development of the TICP, the UA had informal, undocumented SOPs that were incorporated into the TICP. The UA has taken steps to distribute these interoperable communications SOPs, such as through the TICP Implementation Workshop and by including applicable SOPs with gateways and radio caches.

In terms of command and control procedures, the Portland UA is in the process of implementing the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS), and training is ongoing. The TICP validation exercise highlighted some gaps in communication procedures, specifically:
- The communications unit did not precede the unit identifier with the agency name.
- No name was given to the incident.

**Recommendations:**
- Document, update, and implement regional communications interoperability SOPs, and continue to disseminate them throughout the UA.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (including communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage
The Portland UA regularly uses shared systems and shared channels. Agencies report the regular use of gateway systems, which are necessary to connect disparate 800 MHz and very high frequency (VHF) systems. During the TICP exercise, the UA successfully demonstrated the use of each category of interoperable equipment. Local and regional first responders were able to communicate using shared talk groups and channels. However, the proficiency in interoperability with state and federal agencies was not fully assessed, as these agencies were not fully involved in the exercise.

**Recommendations:**
- Involve state and federal agencies in training and exercises.
- Regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional interoperability resources to improve proficiency (e.g., radio cache).
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

#### Technology Overview
The Portland UA operates several shared radio systems primarily in the 800 MHz and VHF bands. Communication between systems in different bands is established using gateways in conjunction with national mutual aid frequencies. The UA is currently planning for 800 MHz re-banding, which will include reprogramming and establishing common naming conventions for talk groups on the regional shared systems. Some shared systems provide overlapping coverage, and a single regional Project 25 shared system is a potential next step.

### Philadelphia Urban Area Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP)

#### Summary
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Intermediate Implementation

The Philadelphia Urban Area (UA) includes Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia counties, as well as Camden, Gloucester, Salem, Burlington, and Cumberland counties in New Jersey, and New Castle County in Delaware.

**Governance: Intermediate Implementation**
The Philadelphia UA communications subcommittee reports to the Southeastern Counter Terrorism Task Force and includes local, state, and federal participating agencies. The subcommittee's authorities and roles are not clearly documented. Formal partnerships and agreements exist among public safety organizations, but they do not yet include all first responder agencies from the New Jersey and Delaware counties. A strategic plan for interoperable communications is under development but not yet published.

**Recommendations:**
- Distribute a formal charter to all participating agencies and meet regularly to recruit new participants.
- Implement and review agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) every 3 to 5 years and after significant events or upgrades.
- Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, including a long-term communications funding strategy.
- Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure regional interoperability needs are met.
- Identify long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) sustainable funding for communications interoperability in addition to grants.
- Involve senior government leadership broadly across the UA on interoperability.
- Ensure discipline-specific leadership actively promotes the adoption of NIMS/ICS.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Established Implementation**
The Philadelphia UA has incorporated existing policies, practices, and procedures into its TICP and distributed these SOPs to all included organizations. Training was provided during the TICP Implementation Workshop. Despite some minor procedural problems during the TICP validation exercise, the UA demonstrated "textbook deployment" of incident command, and the Communications Unit Leader effectively performed his duties.

**Recommendations:**
- Put regional communications interoperability SOPs into practice through regular training, exercises, and usage to increase proficiency.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Intermediate Implementation**
The Philadelphia UA reports the ability to use communications interoperability solutions well in task force situations. However, the TICP validation exercise showed that some participants need more practice with the equipment. The exercise did not include broad participation from all agencies within the UA due to scheduling conflicts.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement a regular training schedule and exercises to increase proficiency with regional communications interoperability equipment.
- Include communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises and ensure all jurisdictions within the area are involved.

**Technology Overview**
The Philadelphia UA operates 19 separate communications systems, including VHF, UHF, 500 MHz, and 800 MHz conventional and trunked systems. Limited interoperability is provided using gateways, radio caches, and shared channels. The mid-term strategy includes implementing a microwave communication system and voice radio network to provide secure communications links between 11 county dispatch centers and 11 Emergency Operations Centers.

### Pittsburgh Urban Area Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP)

#### Summary
- **Governance:** Established Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

The Pittsburgh Urban Area (UA) includes the City of Pittsburgh and the counties of Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Cambria, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Lawrence, Mercer, Somerset, Washington, and Westmoreland.

**Governance: Established Implementation**
The governance structure developed by the Pittsburgh UA can serve as a model for other jurisdictions. It is based on 8 years of success in working regionally to develop published and active mutual aid agreements and communications interoperability solutions. The UA has an existing plan for strategic and operational interoperable communications efforts, but no regular review process for the strategic plan has been established.

**Recommendations:**
- Establish a regular (i.e., annual) review cycle to update the regional strategic plan.
- Encourage a regional interoperability funding strategy, including long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) funding sources to cover operations, maintenance, and other recurring costs.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Established Implementation**
The Pittsburgh UA TICP is built on existing formal and informal policies and procedures for interoperable communications. The UA demonstrated some success in the use of SOPs during the TICP validation exercise, but a few gaps were identified (e.g., unit identifiers not correctly used, problems with fixed and mobile gateways). The UA is addressing these issues and plans to finish documenting and disseminating updated SOPs by March 2007.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly exercise SOPs to test the UAâ€™s proficiency and distribute updated plans to all included organizations.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Established Implementation**
There is adequate communications interoperability within each of the 13 counties, but limited interoperability among the 13 counties and the State of Pennsylvania. During the TICP validation exercise, Pittsburgh demonstrated the ability to regularly and successfully use existing interoperability equipment, but users displayed some difficulty with specific solutions (e.g., deactivation procedure for gateways).

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to train and exercise on available technology to improve familiarity and work toward seamless integration of interoperable communications solutions.
- Include communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises to build awareness and fluency with communications interoperability resources.

**Technology Overview**
The Pittsburgh UA, Pennsylvania Region 13, has 102 shared systems, including UHF, VHF, 800 MHz Motorola trunked systems, and 700 MHz systems. Adequate communications interoperability exists within each of the 13 counties, but it is limited among the 13 counties and the State of Pennsylvania. The UA uses shared channels, gateways, and console patches. Thirty-four agencies have radio caches, totaling around 583 cache radios. The UA is planning to use shared channels, gateways, and radio caches to improve communications interoperability among 1,400 agencies spread over 1,200 square miles.

### Dallas/Fort Worth Urban Area Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP)

#### Summary
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Intermediate Implementation
- **Usage:** Intermediate Implementation

The Dallas/Fort Worth Urban Area (UA) includes the cities of Dallas, Fort Worth, and Arlington, as well as designated public safety agencies located in Collin, Dallas, Denton, Johnson, Kaufman, Parker, Rockwall, Tarrant, and Wise counties.

**Governance: Intermediate Implementation**
Through the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCT COG) structure, a regional communications committee has taken key steps on communications interoperability issues since its formation in October 2005. One key step was the creation of a Regional Interoperable Communications Agreement. However, the UA's priorities appear to be driven by available grants rather than a long-term funding strategy. With almost 300 agencies involved, it was difficult to determine whether the UA had coordinated all necessary published and active regional agreements to include all public safety organizations.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to develop published and active agreements (e.g., MOUs) to facilitate interoperability with all public safety organizations within the UA.
- Develop a regional strategic plan for communications interoperability and obtain acceptance from all participants.
- Encourage the development of a regional interoperability funding strategy, including sustainable (e.g., 3 to 5 years) funding sources.
- Establish regional interoperability procedures and associated training that are accepted by leadership.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Intermediate Implementation**
The Dallas/Fort Worth UA TICP represents the first formal interoperable communications regional SOPs for the area. Prior to the development of the TICP, the UA had informal SOPs to facilitate regionwide communications interoperability, which were combined in the TICP.

**Recommendations:**
- Document, update, and implement regional communications interoperability SOPs, and continue to disseminate them throughout the UA.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (including communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Intermediate Implementation**
The Dallas/Fort Worth UA reports the ability to use communications interoperability solutions well in task force situations. However, the TICP validation exercise showed that some participants need more practice with the equipment.
