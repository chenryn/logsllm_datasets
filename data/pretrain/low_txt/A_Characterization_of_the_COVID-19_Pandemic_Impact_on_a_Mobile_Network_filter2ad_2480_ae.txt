### Network Performance Metrics Across Geodemographic Clusters

**Figure 12: Network performance metrics per geodemographic cluster.** The figure illustrates the median variation percentage (on the y-axis) for each cluster (refer to Table 1), with each line representing a different cluster, over a period of 10 weeks (on the x-axis).

#### Traffic Volume Analysis
- **Cosmopolitans Cluster:** We observe a significant decrease in traffic volumes in the radio cells within the Cosmopolitans cluster areas. Specifically, there is a reduction of more than 50% in both uplink and downlink data volume during week 13.
- **Multicultural Clusters:** In contrast, the "Multicultural Clusters" areas show an increase in mobile traffic volume. For example, there is a 40% increase in uplink data volume. These trends correlate with the number of active downlink users, which increased by more than 20% in week 13.

**Takeaway:** The data indicates a more pronounced decrease in uplink and downlink data volume in areas classified as "Cosmopolitans," consistent with the behavior observed in the EC and WC districts. This decline is largely due to a significant reduction in the number of users in these areas. Conversely, the "Multicultural Clusters" areas experienced an increase in mobile traffic volume, primarily attributed to a rise in the number of active users.

### Related Work
Despite the recent onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several studies have already been published that aim to understand human mobility patterns during interventions. These studies utilize various datasets, including cell phone traces, which are also used in our research [22]. Other sources include:

- **Google:** Provides anonymized and aggregated counts of visits to places in different categories [31][19][23].
- **Facebook:** Offers aggregated data on the spatial distribution of individuals through its Disease Prevention Maps [25][16].
- **Cuebiq:** Supplies GDPR-compliant information for modeling mobility in Boston [4] and Italy [27].
- **Baidu:** Provides in-flow and out-flow indexes for Chinese cities [8].

These studies generally highlight the drastic changes in mobility and evaluate the impact of interventions on the spread of the virus. For instance, TomTom [30] reported a 60-80% reduction in the number of trips during the lockdown, which aligns with our observations from the MNO. Additionally, [21] found that mobility began to decrease about one week before the lockdown was enforced, with the sharpest drop occurring after the closure, similar to our findings using different metrics.

### Impact of COVID-19 on Network Traffic
The impact of COVID-19 on network traffic has been extensively documented. For example:

- **Comcast:** Observed a 39% increase in Wi-Fi usage and a 17% decrease in mobile LTE traffic. Specific types of applications saw increases: VoIP and videoconferencing traffic rose by 215-285%, VPN traffic by 30-40%, and streaming and web video consumption by 20-40% [9].
- **Distance Learning:** In the context of network traffic and distance learning, Favale et al. [10] found a significant decrease in incoming traffic, while outgoing traffic more than doubled to support online learning.
- **Fixed Internet Infrastructure:** Feldmann et al. [11] demonstrated that the fixed internet infrastructure could sustain a 15-20% increase in traffic over a short period of one week.
- **Regional Variations:** BÃ¶ttger et al. [7] noted that different regions experienced varying magnitudes of impact, with less developed regions showing larger performance degradations.
- **CTIA Reports:** The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) provides daily reports on voice and data minute variations. Between February 23 and March 16, there was a 24% increase in voice minutes and a 20% increase in data minutes [5].
- **BT in the UK:** On March 20, 2020, BT reported a 5% decrease in mobile data traffic, consistent with our findings for week 12. They also observed a surge in voice traffic and encouraged users to use landline services for long conference calls [6].

### Conclusions
The lockdown measures implemented by the UK government to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 significantly altered user mobility patterns and network traffic. Our analysis reveals an overall 50% decrease in mobility, with non-uniform changes across different geographical and social backgrounds, confirming previous findings [30][21]. These changes led to a 150% increase in voice traffic, a 20% decrease in download traffic (especially in densely populated urban areas, where it decreased by 60%), and a 10% increase in uplink traffic in suburban areas. Despite these changes, the MNO maintained service quality, with radio load below common values and per-user throughput likely limited by application demands. One issue identified was packet loss in voice traffic due to exceeded capacity in the interconnection infrastructure, which was resolved by network operation teams.

### Ethical Considerations
Data collection and retention at network middle-boxes and elements comply with the MNO's terms and conditions and local regulations. All datasets used in this work are covered by NDAs, prohibiting any re-sharing, even for research purposes. Raw data has been reviewed and validated by the operator for GDPR compliance, ensuring no identifiers can be associated with individuals. Data processing only extracts aggregated user information at the postcode level, and no personal or contract information was available for this study. None of the authors participated in the extraction or encryption of the raw data.
