### Alert Classification Parameters and Real-Time Risk Assessment

Alert classification parameters are designed to evaluate the risk and detect several security-relevant incidents. Specifically, the model can assign appropriate maximum risk values to the most critical incidents, such as a system compromise and an outbound DDoS attack with spoofed IP addresses.

#### Lincoln Labs Data Set

Figure 4 illustrates the real-time risk assessment for the Lincoln Labs data set, showing the assessed risk for three different hosts: Mill, Pascal, and Locke.

- **Figure 4(a)**: Assessed risk for host Mill over time.
- **Figure 4(b)**: Assessed risk for host Pascal over time.
- **Figure 4(c)**: Assessed risk for host Locke over time.

The model successfully assigns the highest risk values to the two most critical incidents: the system compromise and the outbound DDoS attack with spoofed IP addresses.

#### Real Traffic Data from the Technical University of Vienna

The second data set is based on real network traffic from the Technical University of Vienna. This data set includes a trace of nine days for a class B network, but only three days of data from a class C network were used in this experiment. No known security incidents occurred during this period. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) used was Snort, with the same signature set as in the previous example. The model parameters were also the same, except that there were no host-based IDSs in this setup.

**Results:**

- **Figure 6**: Shows the assessed risk for the entire network over the full three-day period. Two periods of increased risk activity are observed, caused by an increasing number of outbound alerts (Fig. 7(c)).
- **Lower Bound of Risk**: The risk has a lower bound at approximately 280, which represents the total risk associated with the stable security state of the individual host Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The individual stable state risk for a host is 1.09, resulting in a total stable state risk of 276.86 for the network.

**Detailed Analysis:**

- **Figure 7(a)**: Assessed risk for the full network over a 3.5-hour duration, showing three peaks of increased risk and some periodic fluctuations.
- **Figure 7(b)**: Assessed risk for a host with no alert activity over the same 3.5-hour period.
- **Figure 7(c)**: Assessed risk for a host with outbound alerts, leading to several peaks of maximum risk. These alerts were determined to be false positives from Snort due to a specific user pattern.
- **Figure 7(d)**: Assessed risk for a web server with periodic peaks of risk values between 20 and 40, caused by probing activity directed at the web server. This activity contributes to the fluctuations seen in Figure 6.

**Alert Prioritization:**

- 46.35% of the alerts are assigned a priority below 20.
- 49.78% of the alerts have a priority between 20 and 40.
- 1.29% of the alerts have a priority between 40 and 60.
- 0.08% of the alerts have a priority between 60 and 80.
- 2.49% of the alerts have a priority between 80 and 100.

The alert prioritization is effective, as only a small percentage of alerts are assigned high priority values. This demonstrates the applicability of the approach to real network traffic. However, the model's effectiveness is dependent on the accuracy of the underlying IDSs, and false positives and negatives can impact the results.

#### Figures

- **Figure 6**: Total assessed risk for the class C subnet over three days.
- **Figure 7(a)**: Assessed risk for the class C subnet over 3.5 hours.
- **Figure 7(b)**: Assessed risk for a host with no alert activity over 3.5 hours.
- **Figure 7(c)**: Assessed risk for a host with outbound alerts over 3.5 hours.
- **Figure 7(d)**: Assessed risk for a web server with periodic peaks over 3.5 hours.

This analysis confirms that the proposed model can effectively assess and prioritize risks in real-world network traffic, although it is sensitive to the accuracy of the IDS.
