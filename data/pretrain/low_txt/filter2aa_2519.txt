## 1. Disclaimers
- **This talk is not**:
  - An endorsement
  - A detailed guide
  - About a particular phone (except when it is)
  - About carriers (ok, fine, it’s mostly about carriers)
- **More disclaimers**:
  - This can break your phone; keep backups
  - This may break your contract if your carrier finds out
  - Your carrier CAN and WILL charge you (e.g., don't use BitTorrent on a tether)
  - This targets the USA cell market; your mileage will vary elsewhere

## 2. Why I Do This
- To explore the capabilities and limitations of mobile devices
- To provide useful information for those interested in modifying their phones

## 3. Basic Skills
- Understanding the basics of mobile phone technology
- Familiarity with common tools and software

## 4. "Feature" Phones
- **Definition**: Non-smartphones running proprietary OS with sandboxed apps
- **Characteristics**:
  - Less expensive
  - More locks
  - Fewer features
- **General Tips**:
  - Use data cables (available on eBay)
  - Utilize serial terminal software (GSM AT Command Set)
  - Tools like BitPim, Gammu, and Gnokii
  - Qualcomm PST (Product Support Tools) for CDMA
  - Ensure unlimited data plan

## 5. Smartphones
- **BlackBerry**
  - Behave like feature phones with few locks
- **Symbian**
  - Similar to feature phones with minimal locks
  - Open Source Symbian may be complex
- **Windows Mobile**
  - Due to time constraints, slides are not included in the DEFCON CD edition
  - Updated deck will be available after DEFCON 16
- **iPhone**
  - Slides could not be prepared before the release of iPhone v2
  - Updated deck will be available after DEFCON 16

## 6. A Brief History of Tethering
- **Circa 2000**: Of course you can! (Cheap data cables)
- **Circa 2002**: Try Customer Service (Two hours and a special password needed)
- **Circa 2004**: You need the secret code (DIALUP? Thanks, Motorola!)
- **Circa 2006**: That’s $60/month (Free on your last phone)

## 7. Other "Innovations"
- **Crippled Bluetooth**: Buying headsets good, ringtones bad
- **Scare Tactics**: The legendary $20,000 cellphone bill
- **Media Transfer Fees**: Yay DRM!
- **Locked Application Platforms**: Yay $10 Solitaire!

## 8. In Memoriam
- List of phones and their fates (e.g., 7868w, VX4400, v715, e815, v3c, v3m, k1m)

## 9. Dealing with Your Carrier
- **Use Automated Systems First**
- **Be Circumspect**: Find faults in features you’re paying for
- **Be Courteous and Keep Talking**: Stress simple points and the need to make calls

## 10. General Essentials
- **Data Cable**: Available on eBay
- **Serial Terminal Software**: Look for the "GSM AT Command Set"
- **BitPim, Gammu, Gnokii**: Essential tools
- **Qualcomm PST**: CDMA only, generally not available to the public
- **Manufacturer PST**: Not generally available
- **Unlimited Data Plan**: Necessary for modifications

## 11. Your Grail: Manufacturer PST
- **High Risk, High Rewards**:
  - Real bricking alert, even when used properly
  - Read: find someone else who's tried it first
  - Remove proprietary UI
  - Change from Qualcomm BREW to J2ME
  - Unlock Bluetooth profiles and USB Mass Storage mode
  - Flash features from newer phones

## 12. Stupid Phone Tricks
- **Enter these codes quickly**:
  - Motorola: #0SETUP* (#073887*)
  - LG: [MENU] 0
  - Sony Ericsson: R*LL*L* or U*DD*D*
  - Samsung: 1475369126874#
  - Use # to open hidden menus

## 13. What Next?
- **Break your phone**: Tweak odd settings
- **“Free” WAP on CDMA ONLY**: Use your own HTTP proxy
- **Cable enabling**: Some phones won't accept a data cable
- **NAI changer**: Covered in detail later
- **“Free” tethering**

## 14. Tethering
- **Carrier-authenticated**:
  - Requires a valid context
  - **GSM**: APN (Access Point Name)
  - **CDMA**: NAI (Network Access Identifier)
- **How to get a valid context**:
  - Buy one (feature phone data plans are cheap)
  - Find one (exploits a CDMA carrier hole)

## 15. BitPim
- **Access to your phone filesystem**
- **Open source alternative** to expensive, proprietary, or nonexistent tools
- **Works on every CDMA phone** since the LG VX4400
- **Uses of BitPim**:
  - Add ringtones and pictures
  - Download pictures and videos
  - Back up your phone
  - Modify system files
  - Another plug for howardforums.com

## 16. Qualcomm PST
- **Yet another bricking alert**
- **Backup and restore service programming**
- **Modify service programming for tethering**
- **Sure-fire Network Access Identifier changer**

## 17. A Brief History of CDMA Data
- **QNC (14.4kbit/sec)** aka 2G: Simple modem, do not use
- **1xRTT (300kbit/sec)** aka 2.5G: Trivial to modify/override
- **EV-DO (1.5mbit/sec)** aka 3G: Difficult-to-modify authentication

## 18. The NAI
- **Authenticates for data connections**
- **PI:EMAIL look familiar?**
- **Most phones have two**:
  - One for WAP/carrier services (~$10/month for unlimited access)
  - One for tethering (~$45/month for unlimited access)

## 19. Demo Time!
- **Who wants to brick their phone?**
- **If you’re reading this, you missed me showing off in front of a live audience.**

## 20. What Makes GSM Different?
- **GSM Data**:
  - Voice plans have per-kB charges
  - No "Free Nights and Weekends" on data
- **GSM Phones**:
  - Sold in free countries
  - Generally support J2ME out of the box
  - Rely on carrier locks

## 21. The APN
- **Authenticates for data connections**
- **wap.cingular look familiar?**
- **Most phones have two**:
  - One for WAP/carrier services (~$10/month for unlimited access)
  - One for tethering (~$45/month for unlimited access)

## 22. Good News, Everyone!
- **The APN is rarely stored on the phone**
- **Special AT commands can set it on connect**
- **Unlimited WAP access becomes unlimited tethering**

## 23. Carrier Unlocking
- **Software/Firmware Modding**: Generally manufacturer-specific, difficult
- **Hardware Modding**: Still manufacturer-specific, difficult, outside the scope of this talk

## 24. BlackBerry Devices
- **Behave like feature phones with few locks**

## 25. Symbian Devices
- **Behave like feature phones with few locks**
- **Open Source Symbian may be complex**

## 26. Windows Mobile Devices
- **Due to time constraints, slides are not included in the DEFCON CD edition**
- **Updated deck will be available after DEFCON 16**

## 27. The iPhone
- **Slides could not be prepared before the release of iPhone v2**
- **Updated deck will be available after DEFCON 16**

## 28. Wait, What About Android?
- **Extremely few details**
- **Questionable concept but extremely open design**
- **Very interesting to see carrier reactions**
