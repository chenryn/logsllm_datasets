### Bit Error Rate Due to Shot Noise

The probability of a bit error due to shot noise can be expressed as:
\[ p_{\text{BER}} = Q \left( \frac{\sqrt{N_p}}{\sqrt{2 N_b}} \right) \]
where
\[ Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-\frac{y^2}{2}} dy \approx \frac{1}{2} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} \left( \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{x^3} \right) \quad \text{for } x > 3 \]
and \( Q(x) \) is the Gaussian error integral [20].

### Practical Example: Direct Line of Sight

Consider a green LED (\(\lambda = 565 \, \text{nm}\)) with a luminous intensity of 7 mcd, corresponding to a radiant intensity of approximately \( I_p = 10^{-5} \, \text{W/sr} \). A telescope at a distance \( d \) with an aperture \( A_r \) will receive an expected number of photons from the LED over a single bit pulse time \( t_p \):
\[ N_p = \frac{t_p A_r I_p \lambda}{h c d^2} \]
Additionally, the expected number of background photons is:
\[ N_b = \frac{t_p A A_r \epsilon E_b \lambda}{\pi h c d^2} \]
where \( \epsilon \) is the reflection factor and \( E_b \) is the ambient irradiance. Using example parameters \( A_r = 0.3 \, \text{m}^2 \), \( d = 500 \, \text{m} \), \( t_p = 10^{-5} \, \text{s} \) (100 kbit/s), \( \epsilon = 1 \), \( A = 1 \, \text{cm}^2 = 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2 \), and \( E_b = 1 \, \text{W/m}^2 \) (approximately 1000 lx, "overcast sky"), the lower bound for the bit error rate is \( 10^{-7} \).

### Indirect Illumination Example

For a scenario where the same LED illuminates a wall at distance \( d' \), and the eavesdropper observes area \( A \), the expected photon count from a single bit pulse is:
\[ N_p = \frac{t_p A A_r \epsilon I_p \lambda}{\pi h c d^2 {d'}^2} \]
while the background photon count remains as in (37). With example values \( A_r = 0.3 \, \text{m}^2 \), \( d = 50 \, \text{m} \), \( t_p = 10^{-4} \, \text{s} \) (10 kbit/s), \( \epsilon = 0.5 \), \( d' = 2 \, \text{m} \), \( A = 2 \, \text{m}^2 \), and \( E_b = 1 \, \text{mW/m}^2 \) (approximately 1 lx, "late twilight"), the lower bound for the bit error rate is approximately \( 10^{-4} \).

### Clock Recovery Algorithm

Figure 10 illustrates a detection and clock recovery algorithm for NRZ encoded binary data. The algorithm recovers the sampling clock signal if the bitrate is known or correctly guessed.

### Receiver Design Considerations

The experiment in Section 5 demonstrates the image quality achievable by an eavesdropper using off-the-shelf instruments under favorable conditions. To improve range and signal quality, a zoom telescope can capture more photons and select a target area with a good signal-to-noise ratio. Techniques for suppressing light from unwanted sources include geometric masking, time-domain masking, and wavelength filtering.

### Phosphor Characteristics

The spectral energy distribution of zinc-sulfide-based blue and green phosphors is bell-shaped, centered at 450 nm and 520 nm, respectively, with a standard deviation of about 20-30 nm. Red phosphors have a spectrum consisting of several narrow lines near 630, 620, and 600 nm, with a standard deviation of less than 5 nm. Color filters or spectrometers can separate contributions from different phosphors, and careful selection of filter frequencies can attenuate background light.

### Countermeasures

To mitigate the risk of optical eavesdropping, display surfaces and keyboards should be kept out of line of sight. Rooms with sensitive information should be shielded appropriately. Background light should be broadband (solar or incandescent) or, for fluorescent lights, use phosphors with an emission spectrum similar to CRT phosphors. High-frequency current-operated fluorescent lights (≥ 20 kHz) are preferable as they have reduced dark phases and lack phase synchronization.

### Conclusions

Modern cathode-ray tube computer monitors can be eavesdropped on using easily available components such as photomultiplier tubes and fast analog-to-digital converters. Eavesdropping from diffuse reflections is most effective in dark environments and within a few tens or hundreds of meters. Direct line-of-sight eavesdropping, even with minor distortions, is more effective. Organizations concerned about compromising emanations should consider this new set of eavesdropping techniques in their threat models.
