### Insecurity in VoIP Networks
- **Why are VoIP Networks Insecure?**
- **Basic Attacks and Their Simplicity**
  - Discovery, Footprinting, Brute Force
  - Initiating a Call, Spoofing, CDR and Billing Bypass
- **SIP Proxy Bounce Attack**
- **Fake Services and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**
  - Fuzzing Servers and Clients, Collecting Credentials
- **Denial of Service (DOS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**
  - Attacking SIP Soft Switches and SIP Clients
  - SIP Amplification Attack
- **Hacking Trust Relationships of SIP Gateways**
- **Attacking SIP Clients via SIP Trust Relationships**
- **Advanced Fuzzing Techniques**

**Out of Scope:**
- RTP Services and Network Tests, Management
- Additional Services
- XML/JSON Based SOAP Services

---

### Key Concepts
- **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)**
  - Used for signaling, not call transport.
  - Extended with Session Discovery Protocol.
- **NGN (Next Generation Network)**
  - Replaces TDM and PSTN with SIP, H.248/Megaco, RTP, MSAN/MGW.
  - Smart customer modems and phones, easy management.
  - **Security is often an afterthought.**

---

### Administrator Misconceptions
- **Isolated VoIP Network**
  - Often have open physical access, weak VPNs, or MPLS.
- **Abusing VoIP Requires Knowledge**
  - Automated tools make it easier.
- **Most Attacks are Network-Based or Toll Fraud**
  - DOS, DDoS, attacking mobile clients, spying, phishing, surveillance, abusing VAS services.
- **VoIP Devices are Well-Configured**
  - Common issues include weak passwords, outdated software, and vulnerable protocols.

### Viproy: What Is It?
- **Viproy**: A Vulcan-ish word meaning "Call."
- **Viproy VoIP Penetration and Exploitation Kit**
  - Metasploit testing modules, MSF license.
  - Old techniques with a new approach.
  - SIP library for module development.
  - Custom header support, authentication support.
  - New features: Trust Analyzer, Proxy, etc.
- **Modules Include:**
  - Options, Register, Invite
  - Brute Forcers, Enumerators
  - SIP Trust Analyzer, Service Scanner
  - SIP Proxy, Fake Service, DDOS Tester

---

### Basic Attacks Made Easy
- **Discovery and Identification**
  - Finding and identifying SIP services and purposes.
  - Discovering available methods and features.
  - Identifying valid target numbers, users, and realms.
  - Unauthenticated registration (trunk, VAS, gateway).
  - Brute forcing valid accounts and passwords.
  - Invite without registration.
  - Direct invite from special trunks (IP-based).
  - Invite spoofing (before or after registration, via trunk).

- **Automated Discovery with Viproy Pen-Testing Kit**
  - **Discovery Methods:**
    - OPTIONS / REGISTER / INVITE / SUBSCRIBE
    - Collecting information from response headers.
  - **Register Methods:**
    - REGISTER / SUBSCRIBE
    - Actions based on responses.
  - **Invite, CDR, and Billing Tests:**
    - INVITE/ACK/RE-INVITE/UPDATE
    - Actions based on responses.

---

### SIP Proxy Bounce Attack
- **Accessing and Scanning Inaccessible Servers**
  - Using the URI field for scanning.
  - Viproy Pen-Testing Kit includes a UDP port scan module.

---

### Fake Services and MITM
- **Using Proxy and Fake Server Features**
  - ARP spoofing, VLAN hopping, manual configuration.
  - Collecting credentials, hashes, and information.
  - Manipulating client requests to add features (spoofing, etc.).
  - Redirecting calls, manipulating CDR or billing features.
  - Fuzzing servers and clients for vulnerabilities.

- **Semi-Automated Fake Service**
  - Communication sequence definition.
  - Sending bogus requests/results to clients/servers.
  - Viproy Pen-Testing Kit includes SIP proxy and fake service modules.

---

### Denial of Service (DOS) and DDoS
- **Impact on Customer Phones and Services**
  - Locking all customer phones and services for blackmail.
  - DOS vulnerabilities in SIP services.
  - Multiple responses for bogus requests leading to DDoS.
  - Concurrent registered user/call limits.
  - Voice message box, CDR, VAS-based DOS attacks.
  - Bye and Cancel tests for call drop.
  - Locking all accounts if account locking is active for multiple fails.
  - Multiple invite (after or before registration, via trunk).

- **SIP Amplification Attack**
  - SIP servers send errors many times (10+).
  - IP-spoofed packets sent to victims.
  - 1 packet for 10+ packets, ICMP errors (bonus).
  - Viproy Pen-Testing Kit includes a PoC DDoS module.

---

### Hacking SIP Trust Relationships
- **NGN SIP Services Trust Each Other**
  - Authentication and TCP are slow; IP and port-based trust are more effective.
  - **Steps:**
    - Finding trusted SIP networks (mostly B Class).
    - Sending IP-spoofed requests from each IP:Port.
    - Each call should contain IP:Port in the From section.
    - If a call is successful, you have the trusted SIP gateway IP and Port.

- **Business Impact**
  - Denial of Service: Short message service and billing, calling all numbers simultaneously, overloading SIP server's call limits, overloading VAS service or international limits, overloading CDR records with spoofed calls.
  - Attacking server software: Crashing/exploiting inaccessible features, call redirection.
  - Attacking clients: Buffer overflow in FROM, sending 2000 characters to test, crashing or executing commands.

- **Attacking a Client via SIP Trust Relationships**
  - SIP server redirects fields to the client (FROM, FROM NAME, Contact, etc.).
  - Viproy Pen-Testing Kit SIP Trust Module: Simple fuzz support, modification for further attacks.

---

### Fuzzing SIP Services
- **Fuzzing as a SIP Client, SIP Server, Proxy, or MITM**
  - SIP server software, SIP clients (hardware, desktop, mobile), special SIP devices/software.
  - **Old School Fuzzing:**
    - Request fuzzing (SDP features, MIME type fuzzing).
    - Response fuzzing (authentication, bogus messages, redirection).
    - Static vs. stateful fuzzing.
    - Smart fuzzing (missing state features, fuzzing after authentication, response fuzzing, missing SIP features, numeric fuzzing, dial plan fuzzing, VAS fuzzing).

- **How Viproy Pen-Testing Kit Helps Fuzzing Tests**
  - Skeleton for feature fuzzing, not just SIP protocol.
  - Multiple SIP service initiation, integration with Metasploit features.
  - Custom header support, raw data send support, authentication support.
  - Less code, custom fuzzing, state checks, future features (fuzz library, SDP).

- **Fuzzing Targets and REQUEST Fields**
  - Request types, protocol, description, Via, Branch, Call-ID, From, To, Cseq, Contact, Record-Route, Proxy Headers, P-*-* (P-Asserted-Identity, P-Charging-Vector), authentication, Content-Type, Content-Length, SDP information fields, ISUP fields.

- **Response-Based Fuzzing**
  - Potential response types for fuzzing, malicious responses.
