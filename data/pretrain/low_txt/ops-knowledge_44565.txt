I have been using PyDev within Eclipse on my Mac for about two years. After updating Eclipse today, PyDev has completely disappeared. I have tried various troubleshooting steps, including a complete uninstall and fresh installation, but the issue persists. Although PyDev appears as installed in the menu, it is not accessible anywhere else.

**Details:**
- **PyDev Version:** 3.0.0.201311051910
- **Eclipse Version:** Kepler Service Release 1
- **Build ID:** 20130919-0819

I am unable to:
- Open the PyDev perspective.
- Create a new Python file.
- Open an existing Python file (it is treated as plain text).

I have a significant assignment due tonight, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

**Update:**

I managed to get the PyDev menu to reappear by changing the current perspective to "Debug." I believe that opening the PyDev perspective through `Window > Open Perspective > Other... > PyDev` would also create the PyDev menu.
