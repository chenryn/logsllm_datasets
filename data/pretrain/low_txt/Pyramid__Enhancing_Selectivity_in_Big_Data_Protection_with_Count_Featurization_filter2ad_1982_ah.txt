### Identifying Potential Mechanisms for Data Selectivity in Machine Learning Workloads

For machine learning (ML) workloads, a productive approach to identifying potential mechanisms for data selectivity is to model the problem as a training set minimization problem. This approach reveals a rich set of mechanisms that can be leveraged to achieve data selectivity. We have identified several promising mechanisms, which we aim to incorporate into Pyramid to enhance workload coverage:

1. **Vector Quantization (VQ):**
   - **Description:** VQ [12] is a family of techniques used to compactly represent high-dimensional, real-valued feature vectors. At a high level, VQ computes a small subset of vectors, known as the codebook or centroids, that are representative of the entire set of input vectors (e.g., historical data).
   - **Advantages:** VQ provides a compact representation of the data, which can be useful for reducing storage and computational requirements.

2. **Sampling:**
   - **Description:** Uniform random sampling and more advanced techniques like herding [68] can be used to maintain a representative sample of the historical data. This sample can be combined with in-use data to form a training set.
   - **Advantages:** Sampling techniques are more general compared to VQ, which often makes certain assumptions about the underlying data (e.g., that it forms clusters).

3. **Active Learning:**
   - **Description:** Active learning algorithms [15] inform users about specific data points needed for improved accuracy. Originally developed to decrease manual labeling, these algorithms may be valuable for selective data collection.
   - **Advantages:** Active learning can help in efficiently collecting the most informative data points, thereby improving model performance with fewer data points.

### Future Work

We plan to investigate these mechanisms further in future work. The key challenge will be to identify the kinds of protection and privacy guarantees achievable with these mechanisms and how to effectively implement them. This paper provides an initial blueprint for this process.
