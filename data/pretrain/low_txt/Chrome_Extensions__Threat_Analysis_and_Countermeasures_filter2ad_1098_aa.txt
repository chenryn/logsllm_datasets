### Abstract:
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the security threats posed by Chrome extensions and proposes countermeasures to mitigate these risks. The study includes an examination of the current permission model, experimental demonstrations of potential attacks, and a proposed enhanced permission model.

## Attacks via Extensions
- **Extension as a Vehicle for Attacks:**
  - Extensions can be used to increase the number and complexity of attacks.
  - Browser Helper Objects (BHOs) and add-ons have been exploited by spyware writers in Internet Explorer.
  - Abuses of Firefox extensions have been widely recognized and studied in literature.

- **Recent Findings:**
  - Buggy Chrome extensions have been identified recently.
  - 27 out of 100 tested extensions leak data (Source: [Adrienne Porter Felt's Blog](http://www.adrienneporterfelt.com/blog/?p=226)).
  - Malicious extensions have appeared in the Chrome Web Store.

## Problem Statement
- **Why Focus on Chrome Extensions?**
  - Chrome has a built-in security model for browser architecture and extensions.
  - The current extension architecture may not be sufficient, especially considering the presence of malicious extensions.
  - Sanitizing the rapidly increasing number of extensions in the Google Chrome Web Store is challenging due to a slow review process.
  - Users can freely download and install extensions from various (known/unknown) host servers, making it easy to launch malicious extensions.
  - Attackers have strong incentives, such as harvesting sensitive content from web pages or modifying search results.

- **Google's Actions:**
  - Domain verification for developers.
  - Signup fees for developers to deter malicious activities.

- **Key Question:**
  - Can we implement a technical solution to improve the current permission model for better security against malicious extensions?

## Contributions
- **Demonstration of Attacks:**
  - We demonstrate several attacks using malicious Chrome extensions through experimental implementation.
  
- **Security Analysis:**
  - We analyze the permission model of Chrome extensions, assuming the presence of malicious extensions.
  
- **Proposed Solution:**
  - We propose a security-enhanced extension permission model and enforcement mechanism, following the principles of least privilege and separation of privileges more strictly.

## Chrome Extension Architecture
- **Components:**
  - **Web Server:** Hosts the extension.
  - **Extension Gallery:** Repository for extensions.
  - **Local Storage, Cookies, JavaScript, DOM, Render Process:**
    - Content Script (JavaScript): Runs in an isolated world.
    - Extension (HTML/JavaScript): Has more privileges but is insulated from web pages.
  - **Browser Process:**
    - Handles native code and is sandboxed.

## Chrome Extension Security Model
- **Least Privilege:**
  - Pre-defined permission sets (e.g., access to web sites, browser tabs, bookmarks, history).
  - Each extension declares required permissions.
  - User authorizes permissions at installation time.

- **Privilege Separation:**
  - Different permissions for different components of the extension.
  - Content scripts can interact with web content but not browser modules.
  - Extension core has more privileges but is isolated from web pages.
  - Process-level isolation: extension core runs in a separate process from the renderer and browser.
  - Within a renderer process, content script runs in an isolated world from the JavaScript of the web page.

- **Strong Isolation:**
  - Same-origin policy: each extension has a unique origin.
  - Accessing other origins requires cross-site permissions.
  - Injecting content scripts requires cross-site permissions.

## Chrome Extension Trust Model
- **Assumptions:**
  - Trusted but buggy extensions.
  - Malicious web pages.
  - Security objectives: restrict web pages from accessing browser resources via extensions and confine damage propagation if possible.

## Experimental Attacks
- **Botnet Development:**
  - Developed a malicious extension that acts as a bot, capable of email spamming, DDoS, and phishing attacks.
  - The extension can receive commands from a bot master using the built-in update mechanism of Chrome extensions.
  - No security check for updates.

### Email Spamming
- **Process:**
  - Upload update to update site.
  - Webmail server receives POST requests.
  - Browser downloads the update and manipulates the extension.

### Password Sniffing
- **Process:**
  - Details of the password sniffing attack are provided in the paper.

### DDoS Attack
- **Process:**
  - Details of the DDoS attack are provided in the paper.

## Security Analysis
- **Trust Model:**
  - Assume the browser kernel and plugins are trustworthy.
  - Sandbox mechanisms provided by the OS work well.
  - Native code for extensions is sandboxed.
  - Web apps are trusted.

- **Threat Model:**
  - Malicious extensions, including both the extension core and content scripts.

### Cross-Site Forgery with Content Script
- **Process:**
  - A content script injected into a web page can access the origin of the page.
  - All user credentials associated with the origin can be included in an HTTP request.
  - Since the origin of the content script is usually not that of the web page, this is a cross-site forgery request.
  - The email spamming attack leverages this vulnerability.
