### 5.6 eMule Traffic to 35.206.63.212

In each week-long capture of the 35/8 address block (datasets A-2, B-2, C-2), 1.0% of packets and 0.9% of bytes were directed to a specific destination IP, 35.206.63.212. Approximately 83% of this traffic was UDP packets, mostly containing 18 bytes of data. The first two bytes of these packets were consistently "e3 9a," followed by 16 bytes of varying data. When interpreted using the eDonkey protocol, a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol, these packets were identified as "Get Sources" packets, which are used to fetch a seed list for a given file hash.

We confirmed that 35.206.63.212 is listed as a fake server on the official eMule forum [30], indicating that this traffic is indeed peer-to-peer traffic using the eDonkey protocol.

### 5.7 µTorrent Traffic

Recent versions of the popular BitTorrent client, µTorrent, have implemented a new protocol called Micro Transport Protocol (µTP) to provide better congestion control for BitTorrent connections. µTP operates over UDP, allowing µTorrent to perform congestion control on its BitTorrent streams independently of TCP congestion control.

In our datasets, we observed approximately 4 MBit/s of µTP traffic. This traffic primarily consists of 33-byte packets sent to various UDP ports. The destination IPs vary, but for a given destination IP, the source IP appears to send packets only to that destination IP. In other words, each source IP sends multiple packets to a single destination IP.

Each 33-byte UDP packet starts with 12 bytes of changing data, followed by 21 bytes of consistent data: `7f ff ff ff ab 02 04 00 01 00 00 00 08 00 00 00 00 00 00 00`. We confirmed that this 21-byte sequence is present in packets generated during a torrent download with a recent version of µTorrent.

### 5.8 Responding to Pollution

To address these unique forms of pollution, we adopt the philosophy of the original authors of [10] to build classifiers for removing unwanted traffic. However, our goal differs from [10]; we aim to determine the usability of a network block and the utility of any cleanup effort, rather than reducing traffic to build a scalable active responder.

Given the concentrated nature of much of this pollution, these classifiers need not be complex and may often simply filter based on net-blocks. Table 8 lists the top 10 most polluted /24 network blocks in 1/8, which together account for 75% of all packets and 85% of all bytes of pollution traffic to the 1/8 network block. Based on this, APNIC has proposed the following filters for one of their recently allocated blocks:

- The following /24s should be withheld from general allocation by APNIC: 1.0.0.0/24, 1.1.1.0/24, 1.2.3.0/24, 1.4.0.0/24, 1.10.10.0/24.
- If further investigation reveals that the traffic to any of these /24s returns to a normal background level, these addresses would be returned to the APNIC unallocated address pool at that time.

We also know that some pollution to 50/8 can be cleaned up, as we have contacted the software vendors responsible for the misconfiguration. Their response was helpful in eliminating the pollution caused by their software. The SIP pollution traffic we identified originated from only a few thousand sources, and the iPerf pollution traffic came from just a few dozen unique sources. These and similar types of pollution can likely be minimized with sustained cleanup efforts.

### 6. Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we have taken a fresh look at Internet background radiation. While today's Internet radiation remains ubiquitous, variegated, and dynamic, we note several important changes since the initial study [10], including rapid growth outpacing productive network traffic, reduced contribution from previously reported exploit ports, and trends toward increasing SYN and decreasing SYN-ACK traffic. Examining traffic across address blocks, we observe significant differences, often clustered in a handful of network blocks. We use the term "Internet address pollution" to refer to this significant nonuniform behavior, primarily resulting from environmental rather than algorithmic factors.

We examine several case studies in Internet address pollution and offer specific suggestions for filtering the most egregious blocks. We aim to develop a more systematic process to evaluate newly allocated network blocks, assessing their potential usability. Any recipient of a tainted network block will be unfairly penalized in terms of bandwidth costs and actual usability of their address space. Therefore, it is crucial to place any such network blocks on a well-known temporary watch list and publicize them to the network operator community.

Address block tainting is not solely due to Internet background radiation; it can also occur when address space is re-allocated from one user to another. Prior ownership of an address block might have resulted in that network block being placed on various spam or botnet blacklists, affecting its usability. We seek to work with the RIRs and the Internet operator community to implement a simple process to mitigate the effects of address block pollution, either through widespread filters or sustained cleanup efforts. Another related issue is the study of address pollution beyond unallocated or re-allocated blocks, including discovering and removing pollution in already allocated and routed blocks.

While some work has been done on examining what is normal for background radiation [7] and how to maximize visibility to unused space within a network [31], we believe this is a very interesting future area of study. We view this work as another step in understanding the phenomenon of Internet background radiation. To encourage follow-on work, we make the datasets used here available via the PREDICT [16] dataset archive. We acknowledge that the current policy for PREDICT limits the use of these datasets to research carried out at US institutions. We will continue to work with existing internal PREDICT efforts to broaden participation beyond its initial scope. Until these efforts bear fruit, we encourage interested non-US researchers to contact us directly to investigate alternative paths to data sharing, including jointly seeking institutionally approved research studies and/or entering into researcher-specific data sharing agreements.
