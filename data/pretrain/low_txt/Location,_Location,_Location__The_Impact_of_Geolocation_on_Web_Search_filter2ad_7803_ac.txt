### Impact of Query on Search Results

The number of search results that change in response to a query varies between 5 and 17, with 17 essentially representing all search results on the page. Our observations indicate that general terms such as “school” or “post office” exhibit higher personalization compared to brand names.

### Personalization Trends for Politicians and Controversial Queries

Similar trends are observed for politicians and controversial queries, as seen in Figure 6, but with notably lower overall personalization. However, there are a few exceptions. For politicians, common names like “Bill Johnson” or “Tim Ryan” show higher personalization, likely due to name ambiguity. In the case of controversial terms, the most personalized queries are “health,” “republican party,” and “politics.”

### Types of Search Results and Their Personalization

It is expected that Google personalizes Maps and News results based on location. However, our findings indicate that this personalization only accounts for a small portion of the observed differences. Figure 7 breaks down the overall edit distance values into components corresponding to News, Maps, and other search results, for each granularity and query type. For controversial queries, 6-18% of the edit distance can be attributed to News results, and this fraction increases from county to national granularity. For local queries, 18-27% of the differences are caused by Maps results. This suggests that the majority of changes due to location-based personalization affect “typical” results.

### Consistency Over Time

Our plots, which present values averaged over 5 days, help determine the consistency of personalization over time. Figure 8 illustrates this by comparing one baseline location to other locations at different granularities. The red line represents the noise floor, while the black lines compare the baseline to other locations. We focus on local queries, as they are the most heavily personalized. The figure shows that the amount of personalization is stable over time, with politicians and controversial terms following the same trend but with lower personalization overall. As expected, we see significant differences in search results at state and national levels, but some locations cluster at the county level, indicating similar search results to the baseline.

### Demographic Analysis

To understand why certain locations cluster at the county level, we examined potential correlations between county-level locations, including distance and 25 demographic features such as population density, poverty, educational attainment, ethnic composition, English fluency, and income. However, no clear correlations were identified that explain the clustering. This suggests that Google Search does not use demographic features to implement location-based personalization.

### Related Work

#### Search Personalization
Many researchers have explored strategies to personalize search engines to improve result quality [8, 17, 18]. Studies by Dou et al. and Micarelli et al. survey various personalization techniques [4, 14] to identify the most effective features. Some studies specifically focus on the importance of location in search personalization [3, 26], using linguistic tools to infer geo-intention from queries and examining the location relevance of webpage content [25, 26].

#### Auditing Algorithms
In contrast to developing new personalization algorithms, recent work measures deployed systems to understand their impact on users. Latanya Sweeney's study on Google Adsense revealed racially biased ad serving [22]. Our prior work [11] and Bobble [24] examine how Google Search personalizes results, finding that geolocation is a key feature. These studies, however, only consider IP address geolocation at coarse-grained locations. Other studies have examined the effects of algorithmic personalization on Facebook News Feed [5, 6], e-commerce [10, 15, 16], and online ads [7, 13].

### Concluding Discussion

This paper presents a detailed analysis of location-based personalization on Google Search. We developed a novel methodology to query Google from any location worldwide, sending 3,600 distinct queries over 30 days from 59 locations across the US. Our findings show that location significantly impacts search results, with differences increasing as physical distance grows. However, we observe nuances in Google’s implementation: not all types of queries trigger the same degree of personalization, and not all expected triggers, such as brand names, include Maps. Surprisingly, we also found that Google Search results are highly noisy, especially for local queries, despite knowing the user's precise location.

Future work includes extending our methodology to other countries and search engines, further investigating demographic correlations, and conducting additional content analysis to uncover instances where personalization algorithms reinforce demographic biases.
