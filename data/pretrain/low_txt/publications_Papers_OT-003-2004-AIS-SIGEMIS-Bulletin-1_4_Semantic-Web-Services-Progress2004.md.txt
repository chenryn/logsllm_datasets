#### Progress in 2004

In 2004, the Semantic Web Services Initiative (SWSI) was established, bringing together academic and industrial researchers from Europe, Asia, and the United States. The initiative aimed to develop an infrastructure that integrates Semantic Web and Web services to enable automation across all aspects of Web services. SWSI not only advanced the development of OWL-S but also served as a platform for aligning OWL-S with other research efforts such as SWWS, WSMO, WSML, and WSMX. These efforts provided Web service providers with a core set of constructs for describing their services in a machine-interpretable format.

Several ongoing projects, including OWL-S, LSDIS METEOR-S, and DERI SWWS, focused on critical aspects of the lifecycle of semantic web processes. Industrial researchers played a significant role in defining standards to ensure the practical implementation and use of semantics, Web services, and Web processes. Key standards under development included:

- **Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS or BPEL)**: Developed by Microsoft, IBM, and BEA.
- **Web Services Choreography Language (WSCL)**: Developed by HP.
- **Business Process Modeling Language (BPML)**: Developed by Microsoft.
- **Web Services Choreography Interface (WSCI)**: Developed by Sun, BEA, Yahoo, and others.
- **XLANG**: Developed by Microsoft.
- **Web Services Flow Language (WSFL)**: Developed by IBM.

#### Trends for 2005

Analysts predicted that the Semantic Web, capable of understanding human language, would replace the current Web by 2005. However, while progress has been steady, it has been slower than anticipated. We believe this milestone is more likely to be achieved by 2010.

Key areas for further research include the functional and behavioral descriptions of Web services and Web processes. Despite significant industrial support for standards such as WSDL, BPEL, and UDDI, few commercial products have successfully integrated a semantic layer with a robust Web services infrastructure. Many vendors are adopting a "wait-and-see" approach, awaiting the convergence of emerging standards before committing to implementation.

In 2005, while many commercial vendors remain cautious, several industrial research groups, including IBM, HP, France Telecom, and Fujitsu, are expected to continue applying semantics to Web services for innovative, discovery-driven use cases. Both DERI and the W3C have expressed strong interest in converging the best features of each specification. Vendors are likely to wait for this alignment, which could occur in 2005, before implementing these standards in their products.
