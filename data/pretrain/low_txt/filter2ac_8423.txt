**Title: Unveiling the Hidden Gateway: The Special Access Feature in Siemens S7-1200 PLC Bootloader**

Siemens is a leading provider of industrial automation components for critical infrastructures, and their S7 PLC series is one of the most widely used programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in the industry. In recent years, Siemens has integrated various security measures into their PLCs, including firmware integrity verification at boot time using a separate bootloader code. This bootloader code is stored in a dedicated SPI flash memory and is not publicly accessible via Siemens' website.

In this presentation, we will discuss our investigation into the bootloader code running on the Siemens S7-1200 PLC and its security implications. Specifically, we will demonstrate that the bootloader, which has been in use since at least 2013, contains an undocumented "special access feature." This feature can be activated by sending a specific command via the UART interface within the first half-second of the PLC's boot process. Once activated, the special access feature allows limited read and write access to the PLC's memory during the boot phase through the UART interface.

Our research reveals that a combination of these protocol features can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the PLC and perform a cold-boot style attack to dump the entire PLC memory. This vulnerability could potentially undermine the security measures implemented by Siemens. However, it also presents an opportunity for asset owners to use this feature for forensic analysis and other legitimate purposes.

The presentation will include a live demonstration of our findings, providing a detailed look at the special access feature and its potential uses and risks.
