I would appreciate having a live preview feature for the changes I make to the configuration. This way, I wouldn't need to navigate to each component's page, edit the colors using developer tools, and then manually copy and paste them into the customizer.

If a live preview is not feasible, an alternative could be to include a preview button. This would allow me to see my design changes without having to download and test them on a separate demo site.
