#### Preface
This volume presents the proceedings of the scientific satellite events held in conjunction with the 18th International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing (ICSOC 2020), which took place virtually from December 14–17, 2020. These satellite events provide a focused platform for specialist groups to engage in discussions on specific sub-areas within service-oriented computing, contributing to the ICSOC community.

The satellite events were organized into three main tracks: workshops, PhD symposium, and demonstrations. The workshops covered a wide range of topics in service computing, with a notable focus on artificial intelligence and its applications. All accepted papers underwent peer review, and the overall acceptance rate was less than 50%. The workshops, held on December 14, 2020, featured keynote talks from prominent speakers in industry and academia.

The PhD symposium offered an international forum for PhD students to present and discuss their research, receiving constructive feedback and advice. Due to the impact of COVID-19, all PhD students participated free of charge. The demonstration track provided an interactive platform to showcase research prototypes and ongoing work in service-oriented computing.

We extend our gratitude to the authors, organizers, and committees who contributed to these important events. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the field of service-oriented computing and its emerging applications.
