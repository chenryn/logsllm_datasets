# Analysis of Hurst Values and Long-Range Dependency in GPRS Traffic

## Introduction
The following sections present the analysis of Hurst values and long-range dependency (LRD) in GPRS traffic. We applied six different established Hurst estimation methods, including the comprehensive and robust Abry-Veitch test, to packet arrival and data volume processes.

## Hurst Values and Scaling Behavior

### Figures and Methods
- **Figures 3 and 4**: These figures show the Hurst values for DVP and Vfe1, and DVP and Vfe2, respectively.
- **Hurst Estimation Methods**:
  - **Hvar**: Variance Method
  - **Hrs**: R/S Method
  - **Ham**: Absolute Moment Method
  - **Hrvor**: Variance of Residuals
  - **Hper**: Periodogram Method
  - **Ha-v**: Abry-Veitch Method

### Long-Range Dependency (LRD)
- **Figure 5 and Figure 7**: Both figures depict typical LRD traffic. The second-order scaling starts from a certain point and continues until the largest available scale. For small scales, second-order scaling behavior is not observed. This scaling behavior is consistent across all WAP processes.
- **Figure 6**: This figure shows bi-scaling with two distinct regions: one from approximately 1 to 8, and another from 8 to the maximum scale. This bi-scaling is observed in DVP for Web traffic in Vfe2.
- **Figure 8**: This figure shows second-order scaling over all scales, indicating strict second-order self-similarity. This is observed in PAP for WEB traffic in Vfe2.

## Observations and Insights

### Aggregated Traffic
- The Hurst value of the aggregated traffic is very close to the Hurst value of the majority traffic, which is consistent with previous findings [14]. In Vfe1, the majority traffic is WAP, while in Vfe2, it is WEB. The scaling behavior, as depicted by the Logscale Diagram, is very similar between the majority traffic and the aggregated traffic. This implies that knowing the scaling of the majority traffic can help in determining the scaling of the aggregated traffic.

### Minor Traffic
- The minor traffic always exhibits slightly higher Hurst values. The roles of WAP and WEB change in Vfe1 and Vfe2. One possible reason for this is that even though we applied the estimation methods on separated traces per APN, the traffic has traveled together through the GPRS network, likely affecting each other.

### Small Scale Behavior
- WAP traffic has a very different scaling behavior compared to WEB traffic for small scales. This difference can be attributed to the different transport mechanisms of TCP and WAP over UDP. The demarcation line between small and large scales for WAP coincides with the average page duration, which is around 1.5-3 seconds [16].

## Conclusion
Based on live GPRS measurements, we applied six different established Hurst estimation methods to packet arrival and data volume processes. The results strongly suggest long-range dependency in both aggregated and individual WAP and WEB traffic traces. The dominant traffic type (WAP or WEB) determines the degree of self-similarity of the aggregated traffic. However, the minor traffic always exhibits a higher Hurst value than the major traffic, which is particularly interesting given that WAP traffic is based on UDP.

We identified that WAP traffic has a different scaling behavior compared to WEB traffic for small scales, with the demarcation line coinciding with the average page duration. Future research will focus on understanding the reasons for the higher Hurst parameter values in minor traffic and the exact nature of self-similarity in WAP traffic.
