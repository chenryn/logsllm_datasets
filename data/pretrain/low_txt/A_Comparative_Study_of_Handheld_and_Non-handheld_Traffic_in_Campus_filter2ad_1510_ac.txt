### Handheld vs. Non-Handheld Video Flows

#### Flow Properties
The cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of video flow properties are shown in Figure 2. Specifically, the CDFs for flow duration, size, and rate are presented.

- **Flow Duration (Figure 2b)**: 
  - 80% of handheld video flows have a duration of less than 1 second, with a median duration of 0.5 seconds.
  - The median durations for all handheld flows and non-handheld video flows are significantly higher, at 5 and 50 seconds, respectively.

- **Flow Rate (Figure 2c)**:
  - 80% of video flows have a rate faster than 0.8 Mbps, with a median rate of 2 Mbps.
  - In contrast, the median flow rate for all handheld flows and non-handheld video flows is approximately 0.6 Mbps.

- **Flow Size**:
  - Handheld video flows are generally larger in size compared to other handheld flows, though not as large as non-handheld video flows.

Overall, handheld video flows are characterized by short durations, relatively large sizes, and high end-to-end throughputs, often comparable or slightly higher than non-handheld video flows. As handheld usage continues to increase, network administrators should consider implementing Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms to support the expected video throughputs.

#### Video Encoding Differences
Video streamed to handheld devices differs from that streamed to non-handheld devices due to differences in decoding capabilities. Most streaming video services use Flash, but a lack of Flash support on handhelds results in MPEG 4 encoded content being served instead.

- **Top Video Types**:
  - For handhelds, mp4 (MPEG 4) is the most common video type.
  - For non-handhelds, flv (Flash video) is the most common.

- **Example Comparison**:
  - We measured the differences in video content served to an Android HTC Dream smartphone and a laptop by watching the same 3-minute YouTube video [2].
  - The handheld device received 7362 KB of video/mp4, while the non-handheld device received 11792 KB of video/flv.
  - Both versions had the same resolution (320 x 240), but different encoding rates: 200 kbps for mp4 and 231 kbps for flv.
  - The audio was encoded at 128 Kbps for the mp4 and 64 Kbps for the flv.
  - The flv version had higher quality video, while the mp4 version had higher quality audio. However, both versions were closely comparable.
  - The main difference was in the file size: the handheld content was about 62% of the size of the non-handheld version.

- **Median Sizes**:
  - The median size of handheld video flows was 316 KB, and for non-handheld video flows, it was 1.7 MB.
  - In many cases, videos were streamed over multiple sequential connections, resulting in several small flows for each video.
  - By comparing the combined size of these multiple flows to the actual video size, we observed that the size gap also resulted from handheld users watching only a fraction of most videos.

### Content Similarity
In this section, we examine the similarity in the content perused by handhelds and compare it against non-handhelds. Our focus is on the bytes that make up the content, rather than the type of content, as discussed in §4.

#### Redundancy Analysis
We evaluate the potential benefits of deploying a "chunk-based" content similarity suppression system, such as SET [14] or EndRE [4]. Such systems can improve transfer throughput and save mobile battery life by reducing network transmissions.

- **Types of Similarity**:
  - **Intra-user**: Similarity found in content accessed by the same device.
  - **Inter-user**: Similarity found in content accessed by different devices.

- **Chunking Method**:
  - Packet payloads were divided into chunks (32B to 64B in size) using value sampling [16].
  - We determined if the chunks had appeared in earlier accesses.
  - We assumed 2GB of chunks stored across all users, as done previously [4].

- **Results (Figure 3a)**:
  - A greater amount of similarity was observed in handhelds compared to non-handhelds.
  - Inter-user similarity was minimal: less than 2% for > 95% of both handheld and non-handheld trace subsets.
  - More than 40% of non-handheld trace subsets and more than 70% of handheld trace subsets showed ≥ 8% of similar bytes due to intra-user matches.
  - In some cases, up to 20-25% intra-user similarity was observed for both device types.
  - The extent of intra-user similarity was greater for handhelds than for non-handhelds.

- **Per-Device Caches (Figure 3b)**:
  - We further explored intra-user similarity by studying the efficacy of deploying per-device caches.
  - Almost 80% of users had less than 20% similarity with their own traffic.
  - For certain users, the similarity proportion was much higher (more than 50%).
  - Most similarities could be identified using only 50 MB caches, with larger caches showing diminishing returns.
  - As handheld usage grows, administrators should consider deploying per-device caching mechanisms to improve throughput and energy savings.

### Related Work
Several studies have analyzed traffic patterns in campus wireless networks. Henderson et al. [8] identified session and application trends at Dartmouth College and observed how usage evolved over four years. Hernandez-Campos and Papadopouli [9] compared wireless AP workloads at Dartmouth and the University of North Carolina. McNett and Voelker [12] studied the wireless access and mobility patterns of students using PDAs at UCSD. While these studies focused on campus wireless networks, they did not explore the applications used by handheld users and their traffic characteristics in detail.

More recent studies have focused on mobile device usage in public Wi-Fi, home Wi-Fi, and 3G networks. Application, session, and mobility trends in the Google Wi-Fi network in Mountain View, CA, were studied in 2008 [3]. The connections between geolocation and usage of specific web services in an urban 3G network were studied in 2009 [17]. In 2010, logs from 43 smartphones were analyzed to find commonly used application ports and properties of TCP transfers over 3G and Wi-Fi networks [6]. Another 2010 study analyzed the protocol usage and HTTP content size and types of handheld traffic extracted from DSL traces [11]. These 2010 studies are most similar to our work, but one focuses primarily on 3G traffic, and neither looks in-depth at the multimedia content served to handhelds nor the redundancy in handheld traffic.

### Conclusion
Handhelds have become a significant fraction of the client base in campus wireless networks, and their usage is expected to continue growing. Using traces from two separate multi-AP wireless networks, we identified key differences in the Wi-Fi content access and flow-level traffic characteristics of handheld and non-handheld devices. Our findings have potential implications for network management and mobile system design:

- **HTTP Traffic**: 97% of handheld traffic is HTTP, allowing in-network security scanners to examine a single application protocol and provide significant security benefits for handhelds.
- **Video Traffic**: Over twice as much handheld traffic is video, making Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms an important inclusion in network design.
- **Content Similarity**: Lower HTTP host diversity and significant intra-user content similarity in handheld traffic indicate that per-device redundancy elimination systems can be beneficial.
- **TCP Flow Durations**: The smaller range of TCP handheld flow durations and the lower percentage of handheld flows with rates < 1 Kbps should be considered when designing wireless power save mechanisms for handhelds.

Network administrators and mobile designers should take these observations into account when considering design and performance. The differences between handheld and non-handheld traffic will increasingly impact Wi-Fi networks as handheld usage grows.
