Google recently announced the release of PEGASUS, a state-of-the-art model for text summarization. You can find more details in their blog post: [PEGASUS: State-of-the-Art Model for Text Summarization](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/pegasus-state-of-art-model-for.html).

I believe it would be valuable to include PEGASUS in the Transformers library. The code and pre-trained checkpoints are available on GitHub: [google-research/pegasus](https://github.com/google-research/pegasus).

This model demonstrates impressive performance, achieving human-like summarization capabilities.
