Subject: Issue with TextField Keyboard Focus After Returning from Image Picker Activity

Hello,

I am the maintainer of the `multi_image_picker` plugin. A developer has reported an issue where, after returning from an activity (such as the image picker), a `TextField` no longer opens the keyboard when focused.

### Problem Description
When the user invokes the image picker, they are taken to an image selection screen (another activity). Upon returning to the Flutter app after selecting images, focusing on the `TextField` does not bring up the keyboard.

The developer discovered that invoking the following code just before launching the image picker activity resolves the issue:
```dart
FocusScope.of(context).requestFocus(new FocusNode());
```
This suggests that the Flutter app may not be correctly regaining focus after returning from the other activity.
