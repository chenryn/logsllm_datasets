## Abstract
The Smart Energy Grid Security (SEGS) Workshop aims to foster innovative research and discussion on the security and privacy challenges, issues, approaches, and solutions in smart energy grids. SEGS publications offer perspectives from both academia and industry, presenting novel research on theoretical and practical aspects of smart grid security and privacy. This includes design, analysis, experimentation, and fielded systems. The workshop also features presentations from other communities, such as law, economics, and human-computer interaction (HCI), providing diverse viewpoints on technological issues. The scope of the workshop encompasses all aspects of the smart grid, including distribution, transmission, generation, metering, e-mobility, and the integration of distributed energy resources.

## 1. Introduction
Smart grid security is an increasingly important topic, but there is currently a lack of understanding and communication between the electricity sector and the security community. The concept of smart grids has been discussed in the industry for many years, and smart meters have already been deployed in multiple countries worldwide. Over 20 annual conferences and events are sponsored by utilities and leaders in the energy industry. However, there is a significant gap in the security research community specifically addressing smart grids. This workshop aims to fill that void and encourage more research into smart grid security by providing a forum for security researchers to present their work. The workshop will also feature an invited speaker from the electricity sector who will share their expertise with the audience, guiding future research efforts. This event serves as an opportunity to foster collaboration between the power industry and the ACM CCS research community.

## 2. Topics of Interest
- Smart grid architectures and models
- Smart grid networks and communication
- Security and dependability in safety-critical, real-time systems
- Data protection and privacy
- Grid management
- Trust and assurance
- Intrusion detection and monitoring on smart grids
- Algorithms and protocols for critical infrastructures
- Risk and threat analysis
- Smart grid standards, testing, and certification
- Testbeds and field trials
- Usability and legal issues in grid security
- Cloud computing and smart grids

## 3. Format
SEGS is a full-day workshop scheduled for the final day of the ACM CCS 2013 Conference. The program includes an invited talk titled "The Future of Smart Grids," presented by an expert from the power industry. This talk will provide an insider's view on current security issues, requirements, and approaches, as well as the future development of smart grids. In addition to the invited talk, the program consists of four sessions featuring presentations from six regular papers and six short papers.
