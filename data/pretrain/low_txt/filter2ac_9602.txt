This document is part of the proceedings from the 2004 International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'04). The research presented in this paper investigates the error sensitivity of the Linux kernel when executed on two different processor architectures: PowerPC G4 and Pentium 4. The study aims to provide insights into the reliability and robustness of the Linux kernel across these platforms.
