### Conclusions from the Italian ISP Analysis
Our analysis concluded that the Italian Internet Service Provider (ISP) does not have any NAT444 deployments.

### 4.2 Large-Scale Measurement Campaigns
Following the initial validation, we conducted large-scale measurements using NAT Revelio on two different platforms: SamKnows' UK deployment and BISmark. These campaigns targeted multiple ISPs to identify potential NAT444 solutions.

#### SamKnows Deployment
We deployed the Revelio Client on a set of SamKnows Whiteboxes within home networks in the UK. These custom hardware devices are hosted voluntarily by residential users. We tested 26 different ISPs for NAT444 solutions using approximately 2,000 Whiteboxes. We had no prior knowledge of these ISPs' configurations. Data was collected from two separate campaigns conducted five months apart, in June 2014 and October 2014. Although the subscribers tested were not the same, both campaigns yielded similar results, indicating no significant expansion of NAT444 deployments during this period.

**June 2014 Campaign Results:**
- Out of the 2,000 residential lines tested, we inferred that 10 end-users were connected behind a NAT444 solution.
- These 10 users were spread across 5 different ISPs.
- The proportion of end-users behind a NAT444 solution was 0.5%.
- We validated our findings with one operator, who confirmed the presence of NAT444 for the lines we identified.

**Detailed Analysis:**
- 90% of the tested end-users were not connected through a NAT444 solution.
- The Environment Characterization phase of NAT Revelio helped discard 60% of cases involving in-home cascaded NATs, which would otherwise be false positives.
- In the NAT444 Discovery phase, the Invoking UPnP Actions test (Section 3.3.2) successfully ran on 82% of the Whiteboxes, identifying 81.2% of the tested customers as not using a NAT444 solution.
- For the remaining 18%, UPnP was not supported, preventing the test.
- The Traceroute to the GRA (Section 3.3.3) independently classified approximately 50% of the end-users as not behind a NAT444 deployment.
- In 9.5% of cases, all tests in the NAT444 Discovery phase gave inconclusive results.

**October 2014 Campaign Results:**
- This campaign covered approximately 1,500 SK Whiteboxes, fewer than the June 2014 campaign.
- We found that 4 ISPs deployed NAT444 solutions.
- Results for 3 of the 5 ISPs were consistent with the June 2014 findings.
- One additional ISP was detected where the Subscriber Device (Whitebox) connected directly to the Service Demarcation Device, but the Service Demarcation point address was private (Section 3.3.2). We have high confidence in this result.

**Validation Efforts:**
- We contacted all 5 ISPs to validate our findings but received a response from only one.
- Several subscribers reported the presence of CGN by detecting shared address space on the ISP's online customer support forum.

#### BISmark Deployment
Between February 7-9, 2015, we deployed NAT Revelio on 37 OpenWRT routers part of the BISmark measurement platform. This experiment involved fewer vantage points but had a wider geographical distribution, covering 24 different ISPs active in 13 countries across the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).

**Findings:**
- We inferred the presence of NAT444 in three ISPs: Vodafone for DSL customers in Italy, Embratel in Brazil, and Comcast in the US.
- The presence of RFC1918 private addresses in the ISP access network (Section 3.3.1) indicated NAT444 solutions.
- The traceroute to the GRA (Section 3.3.3) gave inconclusive results in all three cases.
- For Embratel and Comcast, the Revelio client could not invoke UPnP actions (Section 3.3.2), leading to low confidence in these results, marked as potential false positives.
- For Vodafone Italia, the Revelio client could invoke UPnP actions and verify the presence of the NAT444 solution, giving us high confidence in this result.

### 5 Related Work
In recent years, the detection of middleboxes and the characterization of their impact on the Internet have gained attention. Researchers have studied methods to identify the presence of middleboxes, including NAT444 solutions.

**NATAnalyzer [10]:**
- An algorithm capable of discovering previously unknown cascaded NAT configurations.
- Requires control of both the client and server sides of the test.
- Uses repetitive traceroutes to establish and expire address mappings.
- Does not account for varying timers in different NAT configurations.

**Netalyzr [9]:**
- A networking debugging tool continuously surveying the health of the Internet’s edge.
- Detects anomalous configurations, including NAT solutions.
- Not specifically tailored to detect NAT444 solutions and may not be robust to non-standard home network configurations.

**Tracebox [5]:**
- An extension to the traceroute tool that detects various types of middlebox interference.
- Prone to issues affecting traceroute, but includes other tests for fallback.

### 6 Conclusions and Future Work
Despite concerns about its performance, NAT444 is part of the technology landscape during the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. We proposed NAT Revelio, a novel methodology and test suite for accurately detecting NAT444 deployments by running active tests from home networks.

**Validation and Robustness:**
- We validated the accuracy of our approach by testing a control set of 6 residential lines in a NAT444 deployment trial within a large UK operator.
- We also evaluated the robustness of the test suite by testing 24 DSL residential lines connected to a large Italian ISP that uses private addresses but does not deploy NAT444.

**Large-Scale Deployment:**
- Our large-scale NAT Revelio distribution in the UK showed that NAT444 solutions are still in early stages of deployment.
- Using the BISmark platform, we tested 24 additional ISPs in 13 countries, inferring the presence of NAT444 in three ISPs and demonstrating the versatility of our solution.

**Future Work:**
- Expand testing to regions where NAT444 solutions are more prevalent.
- Deploy NAT Revelio in the SamKnows FCC Measuring Broadband America testbed in the US.
- Address limitations by designing other detection algorithms for cases where assumed CPE capabilities are not implemented or networks block ICMP packets.
