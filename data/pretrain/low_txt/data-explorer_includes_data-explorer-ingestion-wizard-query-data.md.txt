## Explore Quick Queries and Tools

Below the ingestion progress, you can explore **Quick Queries** or **Tools**:

- **Quick Queries**: These provide links to the Azure Data Explorer web UI with example queries.
- **Tools**: This section includes links to **Undo** or **Delete New Data** on the web UI. These tools allow you to troubleshoot issues by executing the relevant `.drop` commands.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Using `.drop` commands may result in data loss. Exercise caution when using these commands. The `.drop` commands will only revert changes made by this specific ingestion flow (new extents and columns). No other data will be affected.
