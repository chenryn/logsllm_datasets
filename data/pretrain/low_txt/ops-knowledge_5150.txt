**Answer to the Question About Azure Data Explorer Queued Ingestion and Data Latencies: Do I Need to Change the Batching Policy?**

If the default settings for the [ingestion batching policy](batching-policy.md) do not meet your requirements, you may need to adjust them. Specifically, lowering the `time` setting in the batching policy can help optimize throughput. For more details, refer to the [Optimize for Throughput](../api/netfx/kusto-ingest-best-practices.md#optimize-for-throughput) section.

Additionally, if you are scaling up your ingestion, it is advisable to update the batching policy settings accordingly. Please note that any changes to the batching policy can take up to 5 minutes to take effect.
