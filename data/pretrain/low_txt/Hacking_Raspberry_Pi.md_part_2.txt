# Introduction
Hi, I’m Tim Warner, and I am excited to guide you through the world of the Raspberry Pi. This $35 credit card-sized computer is incredibly versatile and can be used for a wide range of projects. Here are some examples:

- **Picade Arcade Cabinet**: A tiny, fully-functional arcade machine.
- **Pi in the Sky**: A camera-equipped Raspberry Pi sent into the upper atmosphere via a weather balloon.
- **Streaming Music Jukebox**: An inexpensive wireless music broadcasting machine.
- **Raspberry Pi Keyboard Computer**: A full computer packed into the form factor of a keyboard.
- **DeviantArt Picture Frame**: An interactive frame that dynamically displays artwork from DeviantArt.
- **Pi-Powered Bitcoin Miner**: A small rig for participating in Bitcoin mining.
- **FM Radio Transmitter**: A low-power portable FM radio.
- **KindleBerry Pi**: A Raspberry Pi using an Amazon Kindle as a monitor and terminal.
- **Pi-Powered Motion Detector**: A motion detection system that can take action based on detected movement.
- **3D Printer**: A Raspberry Pi-powered printer for fabricating three-dimensional objects.
- **Cheese-Powered Radio-Controlled Car**: A radio-controlled car powered by cheese and controlled with a Nintendo Wii Remote.
- **Raspberry Pi Robot**: A multi-tasking robot with a Raspberry Pi as its "brain."
- **Automated Chicken Coop Door**: A Raspberry Pi, relay, and motor that opens and closes a chicken coop door on a schedule.
- **Pi-Powered Weather Station**: An outdoor weather sensing and reporting unit.
- **Audio Book Player**: A simple, push-button-operated audio book player.
- **Android Device**: A Raspberry Pi running Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich.

The term "hacking" in this context means using or adapting a piece of electronics for a purpose other than which it was originally intended. This book will guide you through various projects and configurations to help you get the most out of your Raspberry Pi.

## Who Can Use This Book
- **Students and Teachers**: The Raspberry Pi is an excellent educational tool for learning about computer hardware and software.
- **Hardware and Software Hackers**: Those who want to leverage the Pi to achieve specific goals, often with the addition of third-party hardware and software.
- **Tech Enthusiasts**: DIYers who enjoy building and customizing their own devices.

## How to Use This Book
- **URLs**: Some URLs in the book are shortened using the is.gd service. These URLs are case-sensitive.
- **Margin Notes**: Special elements in the margins provide additional information, such as notes and tasks.

I hope you find this book both informative and enjoyable. Happy hacking!
