# Being in the Know: An Overview of Scanning Modern Radio Systems

**Presented by: Brett & Taylor**

## The Basics

### Simplex
- **Definition:** One frequency shared by multiple stations.
- **Coverage:** Limited.

### Tones
- **Continuous Tone Coded Squelch System (CTCSS) / Private Line (PL):** 
  - Used to filter out unwanted signals.
- **Digital Coded Squelch (DCS):**
  - Similar to CTCSS but uses digital codes.

### Repeaters
- **Definition:** Uses two frequencies (input and output).
- **Coverage:** Increased compared to simplex.

## So You Want to Listen to Stuff

- **In the Past:**
  - It was straightforward; you dialed in the frequency and were good to go.
  - Examples:
    - 154.905 MHz: Utah Highway Patrol, Salt Lake City
    - 155.505 MHz: Statewide
    - 154.235 MHz: Salt Lake County Fire Dispatch

- **Today:**
  - More complex with trunked, digital, and encrypted systems.

## What is Trunked Radio?

- **Talk Groups:** Users are grouped by talk groups rather than individual frequencies.
- **Control Channel:** Radios monitor a central channel called the control channel.
- **Frequency Switching:** When a user keys the radio, the control channel directs other radios to switch to a specific frequency.
- **Return to Control Channel:** After the call, users return to the control channel for the next transmission.

## System Types

### Ericsson (EDACS)
- **Enhanced Digital Access Communication System (EDACS):**
  - **Central Control Channel:**
  - **Logical Channel Number (LCN):** Each frequency is assigned an LCN.
  - **Controller:** Directs radios to switch to the appropriate LCN when traffic is present.
  - **Scanning:** Frequencies must be entered in LCN order for proper scanning.

### E.F Johnson (LTR)
- **Logical Trunked Radio (LTR):**
  - **Decentralized Model:**
  - **Sub-audible Data:** Controls the system on each frequency.
  - **Logical Channel Number (LCN):** Each frequency is assigned an LCN.
  - **User Assignment:** Users are assigned to a specific LCN and only move if it is busy.
  - **Scanning:** Frequencies must be entered in LCN order for proper scanning.

### Motorola
- **Common System Types:**
  - **SmartNet & SmartZone:**
    - **Site-Specific and Simulcast Configurations:**
      - **Simulcast:** Multiple sites transmit the same signal.
      - **Site-Specific:** Different sites handle different areas.
  - **UCAN:**
    - **Motorola Smart Zone Omni Link:**
    - **Established in 1997, Operational in January 2002:**
    - **Over 120 Agencies:** Using over 15,300 radios.
    - **38 Known Sites:** Many with simulcast.
    - **2002 Olympics:**
      - **8.5 million transmissions.**
      - **5.5 per second.**

## APCO 25

- **What is APCO 25?**
  - **Association of Public Safety Communications Officials International:**
  - **Evaluation of Technologies:** Focused on advanced land mobile radio.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Enhanced Functionality:** Tailored to public safety needs.
  - **Improved Spectrum Efficiency.**
  - **Open Systems Architecture:** Ensures competition among vendors.
  - **Interoperability:** Effective, efficient, and reliable.
- **Impact:**
  - **Public Safety Transmissions:** Still accessible.
  - **APCO 25 Ensures Accessibility.**
