## About the Author

When my 7-year-old introduced me to his second-grade class, he put it best: "My mom teaches the good guys how to keep the bad guys out of their computers. She has a blue lightsaber."

I have been in the technology industry for more than 20 years in a variety of positions, from marketing to training, web development, and hardware. I have worked in academia as an IT director of a private elementary/middle school and as a technology instructor teaching post-graduate classes at Louisiana State University. I have trained and consulted in the corporate world for Fortune 50 companies and have hands-on experience working and training the U.S. Department of Defense, focusing on advanced cybersecurity and certifications. Currently, I am Lead Education Technical Specialist at Rapid7, managing the curriculum and teaching classes in Nexpose, InsightVM, Metasploit, Ruby, SQL, and API.

I love what I do—as an author, a trainer, and an engineer—making the world safer one domain at a time.
