### Sensitivity Analysis of eXpose to the Number of Active Flows and Time Windows

#### 1. Number of Active Flows
eXpose, by default, mines over the top 5,000 highly active flows. The following analysis explores how the number of discovered rules and their scores change when eXpose is applied to different numbers of highly active flows.

- **Number of Discovered Rules and Scores:**
  - **10,000 Flows:** None of the new rules have a score higher than 0.04.
  - **5,000 Flows:** Default setting.
  - **2,500 Flows:** Same for all rules with a score > 0.07.

- **Rule Score (Modified JMeasure):**
  - 0.05
  - 0.1
  - 0.15
  - 0.2
  - 0.25
  - 0.3

- **Memory Footprint and Mining Time:**
  - **Memory Footprint (in MB):**
    - 478
    - 300.7
    - 237.5
    - 600
    - 500
    - 400
    - 300
    - 200
    - 100
    - 0
  - **Mining Time (in seconds):**
    - 2500
    - 10000
    - 5000
    - 0

- **Highly Active Flows Considered (K):**
  - 10,000
  - 5,000
  - 2,500

- **Figure @: Sensitivity of eXpose to the Number of Highly Active Flows (K)**
  - **(a) Discovered Rules vs. Highly Active Flows Considered (K):** As eXpose mines over more active flows, it discovers more rules. However, the more statistically significant a rule (higher score), the fewer the number of active flows eXpose has to consider to reveal that rule.
  - **(b) Time to Mine:** The time to mine for rules increases by 30% (from 10.5s to 14s) as the number of active flows increases.
  - **(c) Memory Footprint:** The memory footprint increases by 20%.

- **Conclusion:**
  - An administrator can choose the number of active flows to trade off higher resource costs for better fidelity in revealing less significant rules. We set K = 5000 as the default.

#### 2. Time Window Size
The size of the time window used in discretizing the trace affects the number of rules discovered at each score level.

- **Time Window Sizes:**
  - 0.25s
  - 0.5s
  - 1s
  - 2s
  - 5s

- **Rule Score (Modified JMeasure):**
  - 0.05
  - 0.1
  - 0.15
  - 0.2
  - 0.25
  - 0.3
  - 0.35
  - 0.4

- **Figure @: Sensitivity of eXpose to the Size of Time Windows**
  - **Discretizing at Different Time Windows:** Smaller windows lead to fewer rules, while larger windows lead to more rules at almost every score level.
  - **Reasons:**
    - Larger time windows allow eXpose to discover rules for more dependent flows, i.e., those separated by no more than the time window.
    - More flows are present in each larger time window on average, increasing the likelihood of co-occurrence due to chance.
  - **Stability of Dependencies:** At all window sizes in the [0.25s, 1s] range, eXpose reveals very similar rules, indicating that dependencies within a short period are highly stable.

### Case Study: Patterns in the Enterprise

In our traces, we found patterns of typical behavior describing the network setup and dependencies between applications, as well as patterns of atypical behavior indicating configuration problems or malicious activity. Here, we present rules learned by eXpose on a 2-hour trace from a research LAN connected to the corporate network.

- **Load Balancing:**
  - **Pattern:** eXpose found a rule cluster indicating that whenever a client talks to one proxy server, it is likely to talk to other proxy servers.
  - **Explanation:** A client browsing the web fetches multiple HTTP objects, and the load-balancing aspect of the proxy cluster spreads the client’s requests across multiple proxies.
  - **Other Services:** Similar load-balancing patterns were found for DNS servers on port 53, WINS servers on port 137, and domain-controller servers on port 135.

- **Application Dependencies:**
  - **Web Activity:**
    - **Rule:** `Proxy1.500 : *.* ⇒ Proxy1.80 : *.*`
    - **Explanation:** Clients exchange Kerberos credentials before accessing HTTP data from a proxy.
  - **Email Access:**
    - **Rules:**
      - `Client.* : Mail.135 ⇒ Client.* : DC.88`
      - `Client.* : Mail.135 ⇒ Client.* : Mail.X`
      - `Client.* : Mail.X ⇒ Client.* : PFS1.X, Client.* : PFS2.X`
      - `Client.* : Mail.X ⇒ Client.* : Proxy.80`
    - **Explanation:** When a client talks to a mail server, they also communicate with a domain-controller for authentication, look up the actual mail server port, and connect to public folder servers. Most emails contain or link to HTTP content, so users connect to proxies when reading mail.

- **Key Points:**
  - eXpose can automatically find dependencies for important applications without prior knowledge of the network setup.
  - The tool extends easily across hosts and applications, discovering multi-host dependencies.
  - eXpose revealed the existence and effectiveness of load-balancing web proxies, helping in understanding the network setup and troubleshooting performance issues.
