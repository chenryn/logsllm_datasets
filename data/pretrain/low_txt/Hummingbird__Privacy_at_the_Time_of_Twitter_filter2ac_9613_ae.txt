### Overview of Security and Privacy Techniques in Online Social Networks (OSNs)

This section outlines three main areas: (i) results focusing on OSN security and privacy, (ii) techniques for securing publish/subscribe networks, and (iii) constructs for Attribute-based Encryption (ABE).

#### A. Privacy in OSNs

The increasing popularity and proliferation of Online Social Networks (OSNs) have raised significant privacy concerns due to the large volume and sensitivity of personal information being disseminated and collected. In response, the security research community has begun to explore emerging issues and challenges. Recent studies, such as [14, 21, 23, 53], have examined privacy in platforms like Facebook and MySpace.

A comprehensive review by [5] provides an overview of the state-of-the-art in OSN privacy from various perspectives, including psychology and economics, and highlights several research gaps. The work in [32] quantifies the extent of personally identifiable information disclosed by Twitter users. Specific to Twitter, [41] and [40] analyze privacy leaks.

Several cryptographic protocols have been proposed to enhance confidentiality, access control, and anonymity in OSNs. One such protocol, #h00t [6], allows a group of users (communities sharing a common password or plaintext hashtag) to communicate privately. Similar to Hummingbird, #h00t uses cryptographic tags computed by hashing plaintext keywords and leverages hash collisions to provide deniability, enabling users to prove they were not involved in tweeting or following a particular hashtag.

Other approaches include:
- [17]: Applies the concept of "virtual private networks" to OSNs, establishing a confidential channel between friends to share sensitive data.
- FaceCloak [38]: Encrypts and stores sensitive data on third-party servers, accessible only to authorized users with decryption keys.
- NoYB [31]: Focuses on user privacy concerning the OSN provider and conceals users who encrypt their content.
- Scramble! [8]: Uses broadcast encryption [19] for improved access control on Facebook, allowing users to specify recipients of shared information, similar to Google+ circles.

Decentralized OSNs have been advocated for privacy-aware social networking [1–3]. For example, [7] provides a cryptographic API that enhances access control, anonymity, and confidentiality. However, our approach focuses on privacy for centralized OSNs, which support high availability and real-time content dissemination. Decentralized architectures, such as those based on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks [15], may hinder real-time information availability or require users to purchase cloud storage [50].

#### B. Privacy-Friendly Publish/Subscribe Networks

Twitter can be considered a form of Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) network. In Pub/Sub, publishers do not send messages directly to specific subscribers. Instead, subscribers register their interest in events or patterns of events and are asynchronously notified when these events occur. Subscribers register complex queries over events to brokers, which receive events from publishers and notify subscribers. (For more details on Pub/Sub, see [22].) Unlike traditional Pub/Sub systems, Twitter has a single central server, handles simple keyword-based queries, and requires interaction between followers and tweeters.

Recent Pub/Sub privacy-enhancing techniques include:
- [48]: Focuses on confidentiality in content-based Pub/Sub systems, introducing efficient matching at the broker without revealing the data.
- [51]: Uses multi-level commutative encryption for private information sharing in hierarchical content-based multi-broker Pub/Sub systems.
- [33]: Proposes a cryptographic mechanism based on ABE [28] and Searchable Encryption [13, 52] to support confidentiality for events and matching filters.

These solutions require trust among publishers, subscribers, brokers, or third parties, making them unsuitable for Twitter-like settings where tweeters and followers may have no mutual knowledge and should not trust any third party with sensitive data.

#### C. Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE)

Attribute-based encryption (ABE) was introduced by Sahai and Waters [49]. In ABE, decryption capability is given to any party whose decryption keys satisfy an arbitrary (encryptor-selected) policy. Specifically, [49] labels ciphertexts and decryption keys with sets of attributes, allowing decryption if the sets have at least \(d\) attributes in common. ABE was later extended by [29] and [11]:
- [29]: Proposed Key-Policy ABE, where keys are associated with access structures, and a ciphertext can be decrypted if its attributes satisfy the key's access structure.
- [11]: Proposed Ciphertext-Policy ABE, where ciphertexts are associated with access structures, and keys with attributes, allowing decryption if the key attributes satisfy the ciphertext's access structure.

In general, ABE could be used in Hummingbird by substituting cryptographic tokens of tweets with attributes required for decryption. However, there are challenges:
- Follower privacy: It is unclear how a follower can obtain the decryption key for their chosen attributes without revealing their interests to the tweeter.
- Matching tweets and follow requests: The server would need the decryption key of each follower to check if the sets of attributes associated with a tweet and a follow request are disjoint.
- Overhead: ABE schemes require a number of bilinear-map computations linear in the number of attributes, making encryption/decryption operations significantly slower than in Hummingbird.

### Conclusion

This paper presents one of the first efforts to address the lack of privacy in modern micro-blogging OSNs. We analyzed privacy issues in Twitter and proposed an architecture called Hummingbird, which offers increased privacy guarantees for both tweeters and followers. While the degree of privacy achieved is not absolute, it is valuable given the current complete lack of privacy and the inherent limitations of centralized gather/scatter message dissemination paradigms.

We implemented Hummingbird as a research prototype and evaluated its performance. Since most cryptographic operations are conducted offline and none are involved in matching tweets to followers, the resulting costs and overhead are minimal. Future work will focus on extensions such as revocation of followers, anonymity for tweeters, and unlinking same-hashtag tweets.
