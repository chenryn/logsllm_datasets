## Abstract
How do anomalies, fraud, and spam affect our models of normal user behavior? How can we adapt these models to detect fraudulent activities? This tutorial addresses these questions by connecting graph analysis tools for user behavior modeling with anomaly and fraud detection. We focus on three data mining techniques: subgraph analysis, label propagation, and latent factor models. These methods are applied to static graphs (e.g., social networks), evolving graphs (e.g., "who-calls-whom" networks), and attributed graphs (e.g., "who-reviews-what" graphs on Amazon and Yelp).

For each technique, we provide an explanation of the algorithms and the intuition behind them. We then present brief examples of recent research using these techniques to model, understand, and predict normal behavior. With this foundation, we explore state-of-the-art research showing how these methods are affected by fraud and how they have been used to catch fraudsters.

## 1. Tutorial Perspective
In this tutorial, we focus on fraud, spam, and anomaly detection through the lens of normal user behavior modeling. The data mining and machine learning communities have developed numerous models and methods to understand user behavior. However, these methods generally assume that the behavior is that of real, honest people. In contrast, fraud detection systems often use similar techniques but frame the problem independently. By examining the relationships and intersections between these two perspectives, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the methods and inspire new research that bridges these communities.

## 2. Target Audience
This tutorial is designed for anyone interested in understanding user behavior data, including data miners, security researchers, and practitioners from industry and government. For those new to these algorithms, the tutorial will cover the necessary background material and offer a concise, intuitive overview of the state-of-the-art in user behavior modeling. For experienced researchers, especially those working on fraud detection systems, we hope to inspire new research directions by connecting with recent developments in modeling "normal" behavior.
