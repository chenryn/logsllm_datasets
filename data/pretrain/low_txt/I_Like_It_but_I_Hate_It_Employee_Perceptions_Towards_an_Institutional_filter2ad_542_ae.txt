### 6. Limitations

When measuring concepts such as perceived usability, relative advantage, or compatibility, specifically for the DuoMobile app, we recognize that an app is merely a component of an entire smartphone ecosystem. Pre-existing prejudices or usability concerns that participants may have had towards their mobile phones may have inadvertently influenced their perceptions of the app's usability. Additionally, despite the availability of multiple authentication methods (e.g., SMS codes, phone calls) within the new system, a large majority of our participants used only the DuoMobile app. With only six participants utilizing the phone call method for authentication, we are cautious about making strong statements regarding the impact of various authentication methods within this new 2FA system. Lastly, our study is limited to the results from our surveyed participants, and we lack campus-wide data on the authentication techniques used by the entire university (e.g., token vs. DuoMobile), as this data was not made available to us by the university.

### 7. Conclusion

Using an in-depth survey and discussions with institutional administrators, we explored usability and adoption concerns within a new second-factor authentication (2FA) framework that utilizes Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). We also examined various factors within this BYOD framework that led to feelings of resentment towards the institution and unforeseen workplace consequences. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the transition between two 2FA systems within a BYOD framework at an institution.

Our findings indicate that, overall, participants found the traditional token-based 2FA system easier to use compared to DuoMobile. However, DuoMobile was perceived as more compatible with the participants' workflow. While the overall perception of the DuoMobile authentication system was not inherently negative, several factors contributed to it being rated more negatively in terms of ease of use (significantly) and relative advantage (non-significantly) compared to the traditional token-based system. These concerns were often related to BYOD issues, such as compensation for personal device usage, a feeling of unprofessionalism when using a personal device for work in certain contexts, and job restrictions that hinder the use of personal devices in work environments. System designers should consider alternative workflows for individuals who have workplace restrictions on personal phone usage. Failure to do so could result in employees being unable to complete their work, leading to growing discord. Additionally, some individuals may resent the institution if a BYOD policy is implemented without compensation. This resentment could be amplified if the institution mandates additional security features on personal devices, such as password requirements or remote tracking/wiping.

We also found that how a new 2FA technology is introduced (mandated vs. perceived as voluntary) has a substantial impact on its perceived ease of use, relative advantage, and compatibility. These concerns have not been extensively discussed in the literature related to BYOD. Administrators should strive to encourage independent adoption of institutional technologies, as employees are more likely to respond positively. This could include giving employees more time to adopt the technology on their own or creating better documentation to highlight the inherent benefits of newly introduced technologies.

Revisiting our findings in support of token use, we still argue that a second-factor authentication system like DuoMobile is a suitable replacement for more traditional, token-based 2FA configurations. While users may initially resist such a change, they tend to recognize the reasons for it and ultimately support it. Users of digital 2FA systems find them more aligned with their workflow and have fewer concerns about misplacing a phone compared to a token.

As second-factor authentication technologies continue to be introduced in the private and corporate sectors, understanding user reactions becomes increasingly important. Our study shows that while users report aspects they dislike about 2FA technologies, they also acknowledge the benefits and typically incorporate these technologies into their workflow to enhance security for themselves and their institutions.

### A. Appendix

#### A.1. Duo Token
The image below shows a physical two-factor authentication (2FA) token. An individual would carry this device and enter the randomly generated number displayed on it during the login process. This number typically changes every 30-60 seconds and is based on proprietary algorithms.

#### A.2. Duo Mandated Enrollment
At Pennsylvania State University, if a user had not enrolled in DuoMobile by the department’s mandated date, they would see the following message upon attempting to log in to any system. They were required to enroll in the system before gaining access to any major system.

#### A.3. Duo Web Login
This appendix item illustrates the new 2FA login process at Pennsylvania State University. After entering standard username/password credentials, users are taken to a page where they can either initiate a 'Duo Push' to dynamically approve the login, receive an automated phone call from Duo, or use a pre-generated passcode sent via SMS. Upon completing any one of these actions, the user is authenticated to the network.
