## Hack the Textbook: The Textbook Security Project

### Introduction
- **The Problem**
  - Most security issues stem from poorly written code.
  - Students are not adequately taught secure coding practices.
  - Many programming textbooks lack security content.
  - Some textbooks even promote insecure coding practices through vulnerable examples.
  - Instructors often follow textbook content closely, and many are not security experts.
  - Instructors are evaluated based on their adherence to textbook material.

- **Fixing It**
  - **Industry Perspective:**
    - Students should be taught good software development practices in school.
    - Companies are tired of retraining new graduates in secure coding.
  - **Academic Perspective:**
    - There is a perception that this is not a significant issue.
    - Publishers would push for changes if there was a real need.
    - Emphasis is on theory over practical application.
    - Lack of resources and time to incorporate additional material.
    - Not all instructors are security experts.

- **The Project**
  - **Immediate Goals:**
    - Publicly expose security flaws in popular textbooks.
    - Encourage authors to adopt secure software development practices in their textbooks.
    - Revise existing textbooks.
    - Ensure new textbooks include secure coding practices from the start.
  - **Long-Term Objectives:**
    - Make secure software development practices the standard in programming education.
    - Integrate security into every computer science course.
    - Become a resource for textbook authors and instructors to stay updated on the latest software security issues.
