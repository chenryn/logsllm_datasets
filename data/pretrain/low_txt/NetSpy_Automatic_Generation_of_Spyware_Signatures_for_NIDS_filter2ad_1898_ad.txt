# NetSpy: An Automatic Spyware Signature Generator

## Introduction
NetSpy is an automated tool designed to identify spyware and generate network-level signatures for use with Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). This document provides a detailed overview of the experimental results, performance evaluation, desirable enhancements, and related work.

## Experimental Results
### Figure 6. Experimental results using NetSpy on several programs.
- **Server**: `www.bestoftheweb.cc` sending requests matching the regular expression:
  - `GET /errorpage/?src=404&url=.* HTTP/1.1`
- **NetSpy's signature generator** produced Snort signatures using each of the three regular expressions shown above. Note that NetSpy created three signatures for eXactSearch-Bar because it detected traffic going to three distinct hosts.

### Mirar Toolbar
- **Behavior**: Similar to 180SearchAssistant, displaying advertisements related to the URL visited by a user.
- **Encryption**: Uses SSL to encrypt data sent to its home server.
- **Detection Limitations**: While NetSpy identified extra network activity, it could not decipher the contents of the packets due to encryption.
- **Signature Generation**: NetSpy produced a signature based solely upon the host/port pair of the traffic generated by Mirar toolbar (e.g., `64-128-107-140.static.twtelecom.net:443`).

### SSL Proxy Server
- **Option**: To correlate network packets with user activity, an SSL proxy server can be set up between the user’s computer and the outside network. This proxy server can provide NetSpy with decrypted traffic for analysis.

## Evaluating NetSpy with Other Programs
- **Tested Programs**: 9 toolbars and browser extensions widely believed to be non-spyware.
- **Results**:
  - **Benign Classification**: 6 programs were classified as benign.
  - **Spyware Classification**: A9 Toolbar, Google Toolbar, and Yahoo Toolbar were surprisingly classified as spyware.
  - **Further Investigation**:
    - These toolbars exhibited network behavior similar to spyware.
    - EULAs state they track user activity to improve service quality.
    - **A9 Toolbar**: Despite claims in its EULA, it sends URLs to `siteinfo.a9.com` even when the user is not signed in. When signed in, it sends data to `client.a9.com`.
    - **Google Toolbar**: Sends URLs to Google’s home server if the feature is turned on. No extra network activity is detected when this feature is off.

## Performance Evaluation
- **Time Measurements**:
  - Capturing network traffic from a spyware-infected system.
  - Performing differential analysis.
  - Generating NIDS signatures.
- **Average Time**: All measurements were averaged over 10 runs.
- **Web Page Load Times**:
  - `www.google.com`: Quick (fewer than 2 seconds).
  - `www.apple.com`: Longer (10 seconds on average) due to more content.

## Desirable Enhancements to NetSpy
- **Multiple Program Analysis**: Currently, NetSpy analyzes one program at a time. Future work will focus on associating network packets with the program that generated them.
- **Standalone Processes**: Extend NetSpy to detect standalone processes like keyloggers.
- **Protocol Support**: Currently, NetSpy only observes HTTP-based traffic. Future enhancements will include monitoring other protocols like SMTP and FTP.

## Evading NetSpy
- **Input Set Coverage**: Spyware generating traffic under certain inputs not covered by NetSpy’s set of inputs may evade detection.
- **Time-Triggered Spyware**: Periodically contacts home servers. NetSpy, if only invoked during installation, will miss this activity.
- **Heuristic Bypassing**: Attackers can bypass NetSpy’s heuristic by sending data to observed servers. However, this requires physical access to the link between the victim’s network and the destination.

## Related Work
- **Categories**:
  - **Host-Based**: Analyze untrusted binary executables.
  - **Network-Based**: Monitor network traffic.
- **Sub-Categories**:
  - **Pattern-Based**: Use known patterns to detect spyware.
  - **Behavior-Based**: Detect spying behavior through system calls or API calls.
- **Tools**:
  - **Bleeding Edge Snort**: Generates NIDS signatures.
  - **Web Tap**: Detects anomalous network traffic.
  - **Siren**: Behavior-based approach to detect spyware at the network level.
  - **HoneyComb and PAYL**: Generate NIDS signatures for malware.

## Conclusion
NetSpy effectively identifies spyware and generates precise NIDS signatures. Future work will address current limitations and enhance the tool’s capabilities.
