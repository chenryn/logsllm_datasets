#### Abstract
Systems and infrastructures are increasingly being developed based on the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm. The core concept is to encapsulate organizational functionalities within well-defined interfaces and advertise them as self-contained services that do not depend on the context or state of other services. These services can be advertised, dynamically discovered, and composed to form trading processes within a distributed systems architecture.

This talk will explore three key research areas in SOA: Semantic SOA, Quality of Service (QoS) for SOA, and Quality Metrics for SOA.

1. **Semantic SOA**: The syntactic description of services is a significant limitation for developing scalable systems in an Internet setting. We will discuss techniques to semantically enhance service descriptions, enabling more robust and flexible service interactions.

2. **QoS for SOA**: QoS measurements are crucial for the success of organizations adopting SOA. Effective management of QoS specifications directly impacts the success and evolution of Business-to-Business (B2B) and e-commerce (EC) operations. We will examine the need to associate QoS models with self-contained services and develop algorithms to automatically compute the QoS of SOA networks.

3. **Quality Metrics for SOA**: In a competitive e-commerce and e-business market, organizations seek SOA solutions that are simple, modular, easy to understand, maintain, and re-engineer. By calculating quality metrics, we can evaluate the complexity of SOA architectures and provide feedback on their understandability, effort, testability, reliability, and maintainability.

#### Short Biography
Jorge Cardoso joined the University of Madeira, Portugal, in March 2003 and currently serves as the Director of the SEED Laboratory. He has previously lectured at the University of Georgia (USA) and the Instituto Politécnico de Leiria (Portugal). Dr. Cardoso received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Georgia in 2002, under the supervision of Amit Sheth. During his time at the University of Georgia, he conducted extensive research on workflow management systems as part of the LSDIS Lab.

In 1999, Dr. Cardoso worked at the Boeing Company on enterprise application integration with Christoph Bussler. He has been the co-organizer and co-chair of the First, Second, and Third International Workshop on Semantic and Dynamic Web Processes. With over 70 refereed papers published in the areas of workflow management systems, semantic Web, and related fields, Dr. Cardoso has also edited three books on semantic Web and Web services.

Dr. Cardoso is on the Editorial Board of the *Enterprise Information Systems Journal*, the *International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems*, and the *International Journal of Information Technology*. He is also a member of the Editorial Advisory Review Board of Idea Group Inc. Prior to joining the University of Georgia, he worked for two years at CCG, Zentrum für Graphische Datenverarbeitung, where he conducted research on Computer Supported Cooperative Work.
