### 2.7 Receiver and Transponder Setup

For the receiver, we utilized the Weatherdock EasyTRX2 hardware transponder, taking all necessary precautions to ensure the experiment was conducted safely.

To increase the 50 mW power output of the SDR peripheral to levels comparable with commercial AIS transponders, we employed an amplifier. This was achieved through a hardware modification of a traditional VHF transceiver, specifically the KENWOOD TK-762G. It is worth noting that this device is affordable (less than $100 on eBay) and provides attackers with easy access to the hardware needed for malicious activities. The hardware modification involved disconnecting the pre-amplifier's output (i.e., the circuitry from the microphone to the hybrid module's input) and soldering an external coaxial cable to connect the SDR.

### 2.8 Antenna Configuration

To simulate a more realistic attack scenario, we constructed two AIS antennas. For the receiver, we used an omnidirectional antenna consisting of a 5-element collinear structure, which is a standard installation for ships and Vessel Traffic Services (VTS). For the attacker, we utilized a Moxon directional antenna to sustain the amplified signal and improve the attacker’s coverage and precision. The power gain of our antennas was 6 dBi and 10 dBi, respectively.

### 2.9 Coverage Experiment

Our coverage experiment involved transmitting a test message from a fixed station and using a movable receiver to verify the coverage experimentally. By testing different configurations, as detailed in Table 2, we demonstrated that an attacker can reach a victim station and convey AIS messages from a distance of approximately 16.5 kilometers, at the least.

For example, by replacing the transmitter’s default antenna (λ/4, 46 cm in length) with the directional one we built, the coverage doubled from 0.8 to 1.5 kilometers. Further improvements were observed when the amplifier was used. Our amplifier has two selectable output power levels: 5 W and 15 W, which are comparable to standard AIS transponders (class-B and class-A, respectively). Under these conditions, we achieved a coverage of 8 and 16.5 kilometers. Note that this value is a conservative estimate because our testing site was located near mountains, which attenuated the transmitted signal.

### 7. Responsible Disclosure and Mitigation Strategies

Generating and tampering with AIS information raises ethical concerns. As researchers, we are fully aware of these issues and believe that realistic experiments, such as those conducted by Jakobsson et al. [12, 13], are essential for evaluating attacks in real-world scenarios.

During our experiments, we only used harmless and testing messages and did not interfere with existing systems. We also physically connected our equipment (AISTX and receivers) to prevent RF signals from propagating over the air. The coverage experiment was conducted on land (at coordinates 45.69N, 9.72E), and we verified that no AIS receiving installations were present using information from online providers. The closest open water (Mediterranean Sea) was 200 kilometers away, and all nearby waters were not navigable.

As part of responsible disclosure, we contacted the affected providers and standards organizations in September 2013. At the time of writing, we received positive feedback from Marine Traffic and Vessel Finder and are actively collaborating with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R). The latter informed us that they will consider security enhancements to AIS at the World Radiocommunication Conference in 2015. We also shared our concerns with selected Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and coastguards, who are interested in discussing the problems with us, standards organizations, and vendors.

### 7.1 Proposed Mitigation Strategies

#### Anomaly Detection
This strategy involves applying anomaly detection techniques to AIS data collected by online providers and vessel traffic services to detect suspicious activities, such as unexpected changes in vessels' routes or static information. Additionally, AIS data can be correlated with satellite information to find inconsistencies, such as vessel dimensions. While anomaly detection is valuable in data collection systems, it does not address the vulnerabilities of transponders installed on vessels, which remain susceptible to RF-specific threats like availability disruption and Search and Rescue Transponder (SART) spoofing.

#### X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
A complementary form of mitigation is adopting a public-key infrastructure schema in the AIS protocol used in RF communications. We suggest X.509 [9], a well-known PKI standard, where digital certificates are issued by official national maritime authorities acting as certification authorities. These certificates are configured in a transponder concurrently with other station identifiers, such as the Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) and call-sign. X.509 provides authentication for messages exchanged among stations, such as between ships and port authorities. Certificates for noteworthy stations, like VTSs, are preloaded via onshore installations, while generic and previously unknown certificates are exchanged with nearby stations on demand during the acquaintance phase of two vessels. Vessels with satellite Internet access can additionally retrieve certificates from online services.

### 8. Related Work

A significant body of literature focuses on correlating and analyzing ship information collected from vessel traffic services and online providers. Xianbiao et al. [14] use online analytical processing (OLAP) to store, process, and correlate information for collision avoidance and investigation. The same authors discuss in [20] different techniques to organize AIS-collected data efficiently. Carthel et al. [4] research multi-sensor networks for data surveillance, suggesting extending DMHT tracking, originally designed for undersea surveillance networks, to AIS. Similarly, authors in [24] propose ways to increase maritime domain awareness (MDA) by collecting and using AIS data. Other applications include correlating oil slick shapes and tracking data to identify ships illegally spilling oil in the sea [1] and predicting financial gains from commercial trading [17]. In terms of navigational safety, most literature focuses on collision-avoidance systems and prevention, as reported in [15] and [16].

Despite extensive AIS research, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct a security evaluation of the automatic identification system. We used software-defined radio to build a novel AIS transmitter, AISTX, to demonstrate our concerns. Regarding existing AIS receivers, we refer to [8], [18], [22], and [25]. Both gr-ais [8] and ais-tool [25] are software-based receivers built on top of GnuRadio. We used gr-ais in the hybrid receiver introduced in our radio-frequency evaluation. Compared to Guarnieri [6], our work examines faults in the AIS implementation and protocol specification, while his work focuses on data leaked from AIS data collected in the Internet Census 2012 [34].

Similar to our research in smart transportation, Costin et al. [7] perform a security evaluation of ADS-B, a radio-frequency protocol used in aviation for data communication and monitoring. Using software-defined radio, they show that ADS-B is vulnerable to eavesdropping, message jamming, and replay injection. In a similar study, Teso [23] demonstrates how to use ACARS to upload malicious flight management system (FMS) plans to aircraft. More recently, Humphreys et al. [21] introduce a software-based GPS transmitter to fool GPS communication and show how to hijack valid GPS signals to divert a ship off course.

### 9. Conclusions

AIS is a cyber-physical system widely used in the marine industry for vessel traffic monitoring and assistance. Given its importance in collision detection, search and rescue operations, and piracy prevention, we conducted a unique security evaluation of AIS. Using a software-based transmitter that we developed, we discovered and experimentally proved that both the AIS implementation and protocol specification are affected by several threats, offering malicious actors many attack possibilities. We performed responsible disclosure, notifying affected providers and international organizations with mitigation strategies. We are currently and actively collaborating with these organizations to improve overall security. We hope that our research will contribute to this effort.
