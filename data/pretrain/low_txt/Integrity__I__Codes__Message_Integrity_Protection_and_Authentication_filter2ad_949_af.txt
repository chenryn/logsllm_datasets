### Attenuated Mini-Slot Signals

**Figure 10.** Attenuated mini-slot signals. The ratio of mini-slot signals that are not α-attenuated as a function of K;  = 10−14.

Note, however, that the expected value of the ratio \( \frac{K_a}{K} \) is independent of \( K \), and therefore it does not provide any useful information about the role of \( K \) and what value we should choose for it. We will now examine this aspect in more detail.

Let \( K' \) (where \( K' \leq K \)) denote the smallest threshold for which the following holds:
\[
P[K_a \leq K'] \geq 1 - ,
\]
where \(  \in [0, 1] \). Note that \( P[K_a \leq K'] = \sum_{k=0}^{K'} P[K_a = k] \), with \( P[K_a = k] \) given by (7).

Furthermore, \( P[K_a \leq K'] \) is related to a single time interval \( T_s \) during which the symbol "1" is transmitted. By the independence of transmissions, the probability \( P^n[K_a \leq K'] \) that \( K_a \leq K' \) after \( n \) symbol "1" transmissions (i.e., \( n \) time intervals \( T_s \)) satisfies:
\[
P^n[K_a \leq K'] \geq (1 - )^n \approx e^{-n},
\]
where the last approximation is valid for small \(  \). For a given \( n \), by choosing \(  \) such that \( e^{-n} \approx 0.9999 \), we essentially make \( K' \) an "upper bound" on the number of mini-slot signals that are α-attenuated in any given time slot \( T_s \) (out of the total of \( n \) slots). Similarly, \( (K - K') \) provides a "lower bound" on the number of mini-slot signals that are not α-attenuated.

In Figure 10, we plot the ratio \( \left(1 - \frac{K'}{K}\right) \) of the mini-slot signals that are not α-attenuated as a function of \( K \), for \(  = 10^{-14} \). For \( n = 10^{10} \), we have \( e^{-n} \approx 0.9999 \), i.e., even after as many as \( 10^{10} \) transmissions of the symbol "1", the probability that \( K_a \leq K' \) is at least 0.9999. If we transmit on average one symbol "1" per second, it would take around 310 years to see all \( n \) symbols. In this case, the smallest \( K' \) for which the bound (9) holds is a reasonable upper bound on \( K_a \).

From Figure 10, we can see that if \( K \) is set too low, we cannot achieve a very high ratio of non-α-attenuated mini-slot signals for all \( n \) transmissions of the symbol "1". Therefore, \( K \) should be chosen based on the expected \( \alpha \) and the desired ratio \( 1 - \frac{K'}{K} \).

### Energy Content of the Emitted Signals

We have previously argued that it is reasonable to model the phase shift as a random variable \( \Theta \in [0, 2\pi) \). It is then interesting to calculate the energy of the resulting random signal. Let us define a random process \( R(t) = \cos(\omega_0 t) - \cos(\omega_0 t - \Theta) \). We will calculate the energy of this process when \( \Theta \) has a uniform distribution on \( [0, 2\pi) \).

The probability density function of \( \Theta \) is \( f_\Theta(\theta) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \) for all \( \theta \in [0, 2\pi) \). The energy content \( E_R \) of the random process \( R(t) \) within the time interval \( T \) is defined as:
\[
E_R = \int_0^T E[R^2(t)] \, dt.
\]

Now, for \( E[R^2(t)] \), we have:
\[
E[R^2(t)] = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{2\pi} (\cos(\omega_0 t) - \cos(\omega_0 t - \theta))^2 \, d\theta = 1 + \frac{1}{2} \cos(2\omega_0 t).
\]

Plugging this into the expression for \( E_R \), we obtain:
\[
E_R = \int_0^T \left(1 + \frac{1}{2} \cos(2\omega_0 t)\right) \, dt = T + \frac{\sin(2\omega_0 T)}{4\omega_0}.
\]

For high frequencies \( f_0 \), since \( -1 \leq \sin(\cdot) \leq 1 \) implies \( \frac{\sin(\cdot)}{4\omega_0} \approx 0 \), we have:
\[
E_R \approx T.
\]

Therefore, on average, the adversary only increases the energy of the resulting signal \( r(t) \); the energy content of \( r(t) \) without the adversary is \( \frac{T}{2} \) (see Figure 8).

From the analysis in this section, we conclude that we can easily ensure that the adversary cannot block the symbol "1" emitted over a radio channel, even under very advantageous assumptions for him (i.e., no multipath fading effects, perfect estimate of signal amplitudes, etc.).

### Related Work

In this context, Stajano and Anderson propose the resurrecting duckling security policy model, [21] and [22], in which key establishment is based on the physical contact between communicating parties (their PDAs). A physical contact acts as a location-limited channel, which can be used to transmit a key (or a secret) in plaintext. Thus, no cryptography is required at this stage. The potential drawback of this approach is that the realization of physical contact can be cumbersome with bulky devices (e.g., laptops).

An approach inspired by the resurrecting duckling security policy model is proposed by Balfanz et al. [4]. In this work, the authors relax the requirement that the location-limited channel has to be secure against passive eavesdropping; they introduce the notion of a location-limited channel. A location-limited channel is used to exchange pre-authentication data and should be resistant to active attacks (e.g., man-in-the-middle). Once pre-authentication data are exchanged over a location-limited channel, users switch to a common radio channel and run any standard key exchange protocol over it. Possible candidates for a location-limited channel include: physical contact, infrared, and ultrasound [4]. Here again, the disadvantage of this approach is that it may be cumbersome to realize a link with bulky devices (e.g., laptops) in the case of infrared or physical contact. Our key establishment mechanisms based on I-codes enable key establishment over a radio channel in a more practical way for the user as no physical contact is required.

Asokan and Ginzboorg propose another solution based on a shared password [3]. They consider the problem of setting up a session key between a group of people (i.e., their computers) who get together in a meeting room and who share no prior context except a fresh password.

In most IT security systems, the weakest links are the users. People are slow and unreliable when dealing with meaningless strings, and they have difficulties remembering strong passwords. In [19], Perrig and Song suggest using hash visualization to improve the security of such systems. Hash visualization is a technique that replaces meaningless strings with structured images. However, having to compare complex images can be cumbersome.

In US patent no. 5,450,493 [15], Maher presents several methods to verify DH public parameters exchanged between users. This technique had a flaw, discovered by Jakobsson [12]. Motivated by the flaw, Larsson and Jakobsson [12] proposed two solutions based on a temporary secret shared between the two users.

In [10] and [11], Gehrmann et al. propose a set of techniques to enable wireless devices to authenticate one another via an insecure radio channel with the aid of the manual transfer of data between the devices. In [23], we propose an optimal message authenticator, a more efficient protocol that enables provably secure authentication through the transfer of a short bit sequence over an authenticated channel. We further propose a set of simple techniques for key establishment over a radio link in peer-to-peer networks based on the Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol.

In [2], Alpern and Schneider present a protocol that allows two parties to agree on a secret key on channels for which an adversary cannot tell who is the source of each message. It is a pairing scheme that does not rely on public-key cryptography. As a follow-up, in [8], Castelluccia and Mutaf propose two movement-based pairing protocols for CPU-constrained devices. We should mention the work of Corner and Noble [9], who consider the problem of transient authentication between a user and his device, as well as the work of ˇCapkun et al. [24], where the authors show how to make use of users' mobility to bootstrap secure communication in ad hoc networks. Finally, we acknowledge the contribution of Perrig et al. in [18], where the authors propose Tesla, a protocol for broadcast authentication based on delayed key disclosure.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced integrity (I) codes for a radio channel, a novel mechanism that enables integrity protection of messages exchanged between entities that do not hold any mutual authentication material (i.e., public keys or shared secret keys). We have analyzed I-codes in detail and shown that they are secure in a realistic attacker model. We further introduced a novel mechanism called authentication through presence based on I-codes. We demonstrated the use of this mechanism in two application scenarios: broadcast authentication and key establishment. We implemented I-codes on the Mica2 wireless sensor platform and demonstrated that I-codes can be implemented efficiently and without the use of any specialized hardware.
