### Traffic Volume Asymmetries and Protocol Abuses

Our research focuses on traffic volume asymmetries, which can detect protocol abuses where the bandwidth (but not the number of packets) is amplified. Table III demonstrates that, in the context of detecting DRDoS attacks, bandwidth asymmetries can identify more protocols (such as CharGen, QOTD, SNMP, or NetBios) compared to monitoring packet asymmetries.

### Identifying IP Spoofing

Previous studies have addressed the issue of identifying IP spoofing. For instance, Eto et al. proposed a statistical method to detect IP address spoofing by correlating the TTL field in the IP header with the actual hop count a packet should have taken [9]. Yaar et al. suggested tracing back the routes IP packets have taken to detect DDoS traffic [41]. Perrig et al. extended this work with StackPi, a system that deterministically marks packets at routers to filter out untrustworthy routes at the recipient [25]. These approaches complement our research but do not help defend against DRDoS attacks from the victim's perspective.

### Scanning Activities Detection

Another line of research aims to detect scanning activities. Jung et al. proposed Threshold Random Walk, an online detection algorithm for malicious port scans [11]. Sridharan introduced TAPS, which uses sequential hypothesis testing to identify hosts with abnormal access patterns [31]. Paredes-Oliva et al. compared these two portscan detection techniques and evaluated their performance in flow- and packet-based NetFlow sampling settings [23]. For our post-mortem analysis, we seek horizontal scans in a four-week-long dataset using a counting-based approach to detect scans for amplifiers.

### DDoS Attack Analysis

Related work also covers the analysis of DDoS attacks. Bailey et al. described how darknets can help identify scanning activities or backscatter from DoS attacks [3]. Whyte et al. proposed extending darknets to include darkports, i.e., monitoring unused ports to detect scanning activities [40]. Moore et al. used backscatter data to analyze tens of thousands of DoS attacks against a /8 network [19], although they did not specifically analyze DRDoS attacks.

Mao et al. correlated real-world DDoS attacks found in NetFlow data from a tier-1 ISP with attacks identified via backscatter analysis in darknets [17]. They highlighted that backscatter analysis provides limited insights into DDoS attacks, supporting our hypothesis that direct IP spoofing attacks are practically irrelevant. Instead, only the amplifiers receive spoofed IP packets, while victims receive non-spoofed responses from the amplifiers.

### Discussion and Future Work

By disclosing 14 vulnerable protocols, we may motivate adversaries to replicate our attacks. Until now, we have not observed DRDoS attacks with amplification rates comparable to NTP, where an attacker can use a 1 Gb/s uplink to generate several-Tbit/s attacks. Publicly discussing these vulnerabilities may change this in the future. We follow responsible disclosure principles and have alerted both the security community (e.g., CERTs) and software developers of the most severely affected deployments. We are also in the process of delivering lists of amplifiers to data clearing houses like shadowserver.org to facilitate alerts.

We are currently implementing a live-traffic detection tool based on the methods mentioned in Section IV and plan to release it to the community soon. While it is unlikely that all vulnerable services will be hardened, these steps can lead to gradual improvements.

### Reasons for Amplification Vectors

The reasons for amplification vectors are multifaceted. Some protocols (e.g., CharGen and QOTD) were designed in the 1980s without security considerations and are now obsolete. In other cases, specific implementations introduce amplification angles. For example, public debugging functionality (like the monlist feature in NTP) is not officially part of the protocol but added for convenience. Developers of gaming and P2P protocols often aim to reduce upstream traffic due to asymmetric line speeds, leading to possible amplification. Lastly, P2P botnets, due to their hidden nature, have not needed to harden their protocols against DRDoS abuse, focusing instead on protecting against takedown efforts [26].

Designing protocols that are resistant to amplification or even simple reflection remains challenging. Our list of 14 vulnerable protocols is not exhaustive. Future work will involve automating the identification of vulnerable protocols. For example, we could use the methods proposed in Section IV to analyze suspicious client/server sessions with more relaxed filtering rules, helping to identify further amplification vectors.

We also plan to expand our experiments to TCP- or IP-based (instead of UDP-based) protocols and IPv6. We have found many amplifiers in the IPv6 address space, and IPv6 may become attractive to attackers due to its larger packet header and the inability of older filtering techniques to handle IPv6 traffic. We aim to model these attacks in real-time DDoS attack evaluation systems like Reval [37] in the future.

### Conclusion

We have conceptually and practically demonstrated that at least 14 UDP-based network protocols or service implementations are susceptible to amplification abuse. This highlights the urgent need to harden the protocols and implementations of the most severely affected services, such as DNS, NTP, SSDP, or Kad. Network administrators should prepare for DRDoS attacks that are significantly worse than what we have observed. Our findings and proposed detection methods support the detection of hosts under attack and the identification of abused amplifiers. We hope to initiate a gradual, years-long process of fixing the discovered protocol weaknesses.
