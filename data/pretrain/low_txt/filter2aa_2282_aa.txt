## Introduction
The Tripwire Vulnerabilities and Exposure Team (VERT) has been evaluating various approaches to extend the functionality of our RFID/NFC analysis tools. This ongoing research documents accomplishments and ideas enabled through 3D printing, firmware enhancements, and device pairing.

The tools used span functional domains, ranging from the compact proxmark3, which excels as an SDR-based RFID Swiss Army knife, to the more industrial-looking CubePro 3D printer. Our collection also includes a DEF CON 22 acquired RFIDler v22-beta, NXP PN533 USB stick, ChameleonMini, Raspberry Pi, and USB Armory embedded USB stick.

To improve these tools, it is essential to understand their operation at various levels, recognizing their potential and becoming comfortable with using them in new ways. While many of these tools are well-documented in forums and wiki articles, few provide detailed guidance on getting started with the source code. Although developers often answer questions, it can be intimidating for newcomers who may not know where to begin. This research aims to consolidate information about these devices, making it easier for others to get involved. The contributions from this project are intended to be helpful for others using the technology.

Changes to the proxmark3 firmware (now available on GitHub) are documented in a tutorial-like demonstration for working with both high-frequency and low-frequency tags, with and without an attached client. The feature enhancements introduce functionality specific to working with 125kHz AWID27 tags and NFC in standalone mode. For AWID27, the changes allow the operator to act as a reader and to clone or emulate cards based solely on numbers found on a typical AWID card. The NFC standalone mode enhancement allows reading and emulating a UID from ISO14443a-compatible tags, as well as writing a captured UID onto a special "magic" card.

Identified uses for 3D printing focus on constructing antennas using 3D printed forms and concealing hacking devices. The use of 3D printing for making coils is advantageous due to the possibility of lower costs and customized antennas. Device concealment is also explored, with examples including outfitting a clipboard with a proxmark3, creating fake badge readers, and fake badges. Applications range from practical attack scenarios to research scenarios. As insecure low-frequency access cards still dominate the workplace and NFC technology gains momentum, it is crucial to prepare our tools to identify emerging threats.

## RFID at a Glance
RFID tags, badges, and cards come in two main categories: low frequency and high frequency. As of May 2013, legacy 125kHz proximity technology was used in 70-80% of all physical access control systems, according to Stephanie Ardiley, product manager at HID Global. Implantable low-frequency RFID chips have also seen widespread use for identifying lost pets. These are fairly simplistic systems where the reader energizes a coil to power up a chip and modulate back a stored number. High-frequency RFID, on the other hand, includes applications like contactless credit cards, public transit fare cards, smart posters, and other functions utilizing Near Field Communication (NFC) built around ISO14443a.

### What is an RFID Tag?
The RFID tags described in this paper are passive devices. They are essentially coils of wire tuned to a connected integrated circuit. When the coil is within the field produced by the carrier signal of the reader, it induces current to power the integrated circuit. The chip then performs its designated function, such as transmitting a stored number.
