### Explicit Release of Information to Public Health Authorities

Covered entities may release information to public health authorities without explicit consent, provided that the release is restricted to the "minimum necessary" and accountability for all such releases is maintained. The public health community recognizes the significant responsibility this HIPAA provision carries, emphasizing the need to respect and protect the public's trust. Public health agencies must comply with federal and state laws and regulations regarding the protection of private and confidential information. Additionally, the public expects their personal privacy to be respected and their information protected.

As electronic health information flows from laboratories to hospitals, clinics, and health departments, and from local to state to national health agencies, public health faces the challenge of balancing the protection of the nationâ€™s health and safety with the respect for individual privacy. The decision to use the Internet as the backbone for the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) requires robust security features and architectural assurances to counter inherent vulnerabilities. These measures not only protect sensitive information against unauthorized disclosure but also ensure the integrity of data and the availability of critical services.

Public health continually addresses this challenge at all jurisdictional levels and in all functional areas.

### PHIN Certification Requirements

The PHIN Certification Requirements address all of the technical safeguards prescribed by the HIPAA Security Rule, including:

- **Access Control**: Role-based, mandatory access control protocols.
- **Audit Controls**: Realistic and effective policies for the use and administration of information technology resources.
- **Integrity**: Registry de-duplication and automatic data-linking to preserve the integrity of case-investigation data.
- **Authentication**: Client and server X.509 digital certificates or comparable strong authentication methods.
- **Transmission Security**: Encryption of sensitive data prior to transmission over a secured HTTPS connection.
- **Availability/Continuity of Operations**: Continuity of operations planning and procedure implementation, including management of man-made and natural catastrophic events.

#### Technical Safeguards

- **Access Control**: Access and control of data via selective integrated repository authorization.
- **Audit Controls**: Prompt application of security patches and configuration corrections.
- **Integrity**: Lightweight Data Access Protocol (LDAP) directories of public health personnel to support authentication and access authorizations.
- **Authentication**: Authentication based on industry-standard X.579 certificates, secure tokens, or comparable means.
- **Transmission Security**: Secure messaging and alerting (via multiple channels), including secure archival and authenticated electronic discussions.
- **Availability/Continuity of Operations**: Routine offsite backups and security policy monitoring.

### De-Identification of Personal Identifiers

Personal identifiers are removed as necessary and appropriate for data exchanges among public health partners. The following table outlines the inclusion and exclusion of specific data elements:
