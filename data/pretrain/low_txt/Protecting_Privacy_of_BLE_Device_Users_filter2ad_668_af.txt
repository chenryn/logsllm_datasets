### Energy Overhead Analysis
**Figure 12:** The energy overhead of BLE-Guardian running on a Samsung Galaxy S4.

**Figure 12b** illustrates the average energy overhead when BLE-Guardian is protecting a set of ten devices (as described earlier) at different advertising intervals. In the worst-case scenario, where there are 10 target BLE devices, including some advertising at the highest possible frequency, the energy overhead is limited to 16%, regardless of the presence of other advertisers in the area. In other cases, with fewer target devices or devices advertising at lower frequencies, the energy overhead is negligible.

### Conclusion
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is emerging as the most prominent and promising communication protocol for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, it also introduces a set of privacy risks. An adversary can track, profile, and even harm users through BLE-equipped devices that constantly advertise their presence. Existing solutions are impractical as they require modifications to the BLE-equipped devices, making deployment difficult.

In this paper, we presented BLE-Guardian, a device-agnostic system that addresses the privacy risks associated with BLE-equipped devices. BLE-Guardian does not require any modifications to the BLE protocol and can be implemented using off-the-shelf Bluetooth hardware. We implemented BLE-Guardian using Ubertooth One radio and Android, and evaluated its effectiveness in protecting users' privacy. In future work, we plan to explore the data plane by analyzing and reducing data leaks from BLE devices to unauthorized clients.

### Analysis of Device Hiding
BLE-Guardian may jam the advertisements of non-target devices, which could disrupt their operation, as discussed in Section 5.3.2. However, due to the random delay introduced before each advertisement, such "collision" events become unlikely. We show that the expected number of another device's advertisements within the expected advertising interval of the target BLE device will always be less than 1 when BLE-Guardian protects a single BLE device.

The advertising process of a single BLE device can be viewed as a renewal process, where each event corresponds to an advertising session. The inter-arrival times, \(X_i\), are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables such that \(X_i \sim \text{Uniform}(adv, adv + 10)\). The \(n\)-th advertisement time \(T_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i\) has a distribution defined by the \(n\)-fold convolution of the distribution of \(X_i\). As \(n\) increases, the probability distribution of the \(n\)-th advertisement spreads over a larger time interval \(A = [n \cdot adv, n \cdot (adv + 10)]\).

The device hiding module attempts jamming at an interval of 10 ms. If this jamming interval falls within the expected advertising interval of another device, the second situation of Section 5.3.2 might occur. However, as \(n\) increases, the length of interval \(A\) increases, and thus the expected number of advertisements from a single device within 10 ms should be less than 1.

We show below how the expected number of advertisements in a 10 ms interval drops between \(n = 1\) and \(n = 2\). We consider \(m(t)\), the expected number of events up to time \(t\), defined as:
\[ m(t) = \int_0^t m(t - x) f_X(x) \, dx, \]
where \(f_X(x)\) is the probability distribution of \(X_i\), which is \(\text{Uniform}(adv, adv + 10)\), and \(F_X(t)\) is the cumulative distribution function given as:
\[ F_X(t) = \begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } t < adv \\
\frac{t - adv}{10} & \text{if } adv \leq t \leq adv + 10 \\
1 & \text{if } t > adv + 10 
\end{cases} \]

During the first advertising interval, \(t \in [adv, adv + 10]\), the expected number of advertisements is \(\frac{t - adv}{10}\). So, if the expected advertising interval of the device hiding module overlaps with the first advertising interval of another device, the expected number of events, \(m(adv + 10) - m(adv)\), will be 1, which is intuitive.

The second advertisement will take place in the interval \(B = [2 \cdot adv, 2 \cdot (adv + 10)]\). Using a similar procedure, we derive the expressions for \(m(t)\) for \(t \in [2 \cdot adv, 2 \cdot (adv + 10)]\). If the expected advertising interval of the device hiding module overlaps with interval \(B\), the expected number of advertisements \(m(t + 10) - m(t)\) will drop to \(\frac{1}{2}\). This trend continues for subsequent advertising intervals; the expected number of another device's advertisements within the expected advertising interval of the target BLE device will always be less than 1.

Finally, even if another device with the same advertising parameters starts advertising simultaneously with the target BLE device, their advertising events will eventually diverge. After \(N\) advertisements from both devices, the distribution of \(T_a(N+1) - T_b(N+1)\), the difference in time between the \(N + 1\) advertising instants of both devices, will be a random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation \(\sigma = 2 \cdot N \cdot \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}\). As \(N\) increases, the standard deviation increases, decreasing the probability of both advertising events taking place within 10 ms. The 10 ms advertising interval is the length of the interval that the device hiding module expects the target BLE device to advertise.
