### Logging into Bank Accounts and Simulated Attacks

No simulated attacks were conducted against users during the task of logging into their bank accounts. Requiring users to use their own accounts is a good starting point for creating a sense of risk. However, the extent to which the academic setting influenced users' perception of actual risk remains unclear. Even if experimenters were not in the same room as the users, their proximity may have influenced users to appear more "helpful" and behave with less caution than they typically would.

### Simulated Attacks Without Prior Consent

A few studies have simulated attacks on users in real-world settings without obtaining prior consent. For example, a study at the United States Military Academy at West Point sent cadets a simulated phishing email from a fictitious Colonel, commanding them to click on a link [19]. Similar studies by Jagatic et al. [30] and Jakobsson et al. [31] also remotely simulated phishing attacks. While these studies closely mimicked real attacks and provided large datasets, the lack of prior consent raised ethical concerns. Some participants, upon learning they were unknowing participants, responded with anger and even threatened legal action [11]. Additionally, these studies collected limited demographic and behavioral data and did not conduct exit surveys to probe users' decision-making processes.

### Email for Authentication

Other researchers have proposed using email for authentication [2, 6, 21, 23, 48]. Specifically, the design of Simple Authentication for the Web (SAW) by Horst and Seamons is similar to our email registration ceremony [48]. The key difference is that we propose using email only for infrequent machine registrations, such as credential initialization, while SAW authors suggest using email authentication as a direct replacement for passwords. In SAW, users receive a new email link for each authentication attempt. However, the SAW authors do not address social engineering attacks aimed at stealing authentication links.

### User Conditioning and Education

Previous anti-phishing research has explored user conditioning through secure attention keys. Tools like PwdHash [43] and Web Wallet [59] use a secure attention key to create a trusted path between the user and the browser. Although these tools require users to activate the secure attention key before entering sensitive information, they may be vulnerable to attacks that persuade users to omit this step. A user study of Web Wallet suggests that this attack strategy can be effective [59].

Related to conditioning is training and education. Several researchers have proposed innovative methods for teaching users about Internet security and social engineering attacks [35, 45, 56]. Initial results are promising, and related research indicates that better-informed users may be more likely to resist attacks [15]. However, user education has its limitations. If not periodically reinforced, users may forget or neglect defensive habits. Furthermore, a study involving interviews designed to reveal users' decision-making strategies for suspicious emails suggests that while users can manage familiar risks, generalizing this knowledge to resist unfamiliar attacks is challenging [14]. These findings imply that educational approaches must continually adapt to address new threats; otherwise, users' defensive strategies may become outdated and ineffective.

### Conclusion

Our study results indicate that 1) ceremonies can influence user behavior, both positively and negatively, and 2) the resilience of a ceremony to social engineering depends on whether the actions it conditions users to take are safe to perform in the presence of an adversary. These findings suggest that conditioned-safe ceremonies may be a useful concept for building ceremonies resistant to social engineering attacks. We proposed several design principles for conditioned-safe ceremonies and described one such ceremony, email registration, designed according to these principles. Although email registration may not be a perfect solution, it serves as a useful example for further exploration and evaluation. The fact that 42% of email users in our study were vulnerable to simulated attacks highlights the significant challenge in designing ceremonies to resist social engineering.
