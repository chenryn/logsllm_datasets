# Dataset Overlap Analysis

| Dataset | Size (in /24 prefixes) | Percentage of Overlap |
|---------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Cache Probing | 9,753.9K (100.0%) | - |
| DNS Logs | 6,647.8K (75.1%) | - |
| Microsoft Clients | 954.1K (98.6%) | - |

**Table 1: Intersection of /24 prefixes observed in the datasets. The percentage in parentheses indicates the proportion of the row dataset also observed in the column dataset. The diagonal values represent the total size of each dataset.**

## Activity Estimation

The minimum activity consistent with our measurements is a single active /24 per non-overlapping prefix with a cache hit. The upper bound assumes activity within all /24 prefixes in a prefix with a cache hit. Results vary widely across ASes, with some having only a small fraction of active prefixes and others having most or all prefixes active. This suggests that APNIC's per-AS granularity is too coarse for IP-level activity understanding. Our techniques help bridge this gap, but there is room for refinement, as the median percentage of active prefixes per AS could range from 25% to 100%.

## Prefix-Level Analysis

Table 1 shows the overlap in /24 prefixes found to be hosting clients using our methods and in privileged Microsoft traces. We upper-bound our cache probing coverage by assuming that if a prefix contains clients, all /24 prefixes within that (possibly larger) prefix contain clients. Our methods capture 9.75M /24 prefixes, including 75.1% of /24 prefixes seen by Microsoft clients, representing 95.2% of Microsoft client volume. Although our DNS logs method only finds 692.2K prefixes, 95.5% of these are also in Microsoft clients, indicating high precision. However, only 6.6M (74.7%) of the /24 prefixes included in cache probing were also seen by Microsoft clients, suggesting that our upper bound on cache probing is too generous. Future work will focus on improving precision. Still, 99.1% of prefixes returned as the scope for our cache probing queries contain at least one /24 in Microsoft clients, indicating few false positives.

## Related Work

Our cache snooping approach is inspired by earlier methods that either snoop Google Public DNS or use ECS to simulate access to vantage points worldwide. Two studies used ECS scans to uncover client-to-server mapping for CDNs [7, 34], but they did not use Google Public DNS and were interested in CDN direction, not actual client queries. A recent study demonstrated how cache snooping can estimate usage of rare domains [31], but it was limited to 43 U.S. vantage points and 7 Google PoPs. Other work investigated ECS behavior of recursive resolvers [3]. Previous studies estimated website popularity using open resolvers [29, 37], while we use popular domains to identify Internet clients. A recent study analyzed ECS queries from Google Public DNS [14], revealing aspects of its adoption, though the view is biased towards Dutch domain names. Another study used connection logs from a CDN to estimate Internet activity at the IP address level [32].

## Conclusions and Future Work

Measuring user Internet activity provides valuable data for research. We present preliminary work on new techniques for measuring client activity—cache probing Google Public DNS and crawling root DNS traces. These techniques have global coverage, can be replicated without privileged data, and provide fine-grained client activity data. Future work will focus on inferring which prefixes with client activity likely include human user activity, using signals such as activity across user-facing services, diurnal patterns, and consistency across methods. We aim to obtain a relative activity ranking across prefixes, similar to APNIC's AS listings [19]. Combining information from our techniques is challenging, but geolocation may help estimate activity at the ⟨region, AS⟩ granularity. Additionally, we are developing techniques to estimate prefix cache hit rates over time and across domains to rank prefix activity levels. Future work will investigate which methodologies are best for specific questions, bringing us closer to understanding user interactions with the Internet.

## Additional Validation of Methodologies

### Coverage of Google Public DNS PoPs

Our current vantage points probe 22 Google Public DNS PoPs. Figure 5 shows the locations of these PoPs and the ones we do not probe. Of the 23 unprobed PoPs, 5 appear as recursive resolvers in our Microsoft resolvers dataset, indicating they serve clients. The other 18 do not query Microsoft Azure’s DNS Traffic Manager, suggesting they are not actively serving users or announcing the anycast route. The 5 unprobed and verified sites account for only 5% of the Google Public DNS queries seen by Microsoft, while the 22 probed and verified sites account for 95%. This suggests that the unprobed and verified sites receive little traffic, resulting in fewer ECS cache hits and fewer anycast routes reaching them.

### Validating ECS Query Scopes

Section 3.1.1 describes how we set the prefix scopes for ECS queries to reduce probing overhead. Table 2 shows that 90% of responses have the same scope as the query, indicating that our approach has little impact on results. 97% of the hits have response scopes and query scopes that differ by at most 2, and only 1% differ by more than 4. This demonstrates that the vast majority of response scopes are stable, and our query scope reduction technique significantly reduces probing overhead without affecting results.

## Additional Measurement Results

### Dataset Overlap by AS

Table 3 expands on the results from Section 4, showing the overlap in ASes detected as hosting users by five techniques: our cache probing, our crawls of root DNS logs, APNIC, Microsoft clients, and Microsoft resolvers. Each entry shows the intersection of ASes observed in the two datasets, with the parentheses indicating the coverage of that technique relative to the others.
