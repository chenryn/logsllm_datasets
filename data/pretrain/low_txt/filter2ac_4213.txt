**Title: Black Hat US-18: New Norms and Policies in Cyber-Diplomacy**

Following the collapse of the UN-sponsored consultations on international cybersecurity in 2016, the landscape of cyber diplomacy has been in a state of flux. Key questions have emerged: Will there be further rounds of UN discussions? Will private sector-led initiatives play a more significant role? And what norms and rules of behavior in cyberspace will be agreed upon for both state and non-state actors?

The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) has been actively addressing these issues. At Black Hat US-18, members of the GCSC will discuss emerging norms, such as safeguarding the critical infrastructure of the Internet and protecting electoral systems from cyber attacks. They will also provide insights into the current thinking of the Commission, as well as the perspectives of governments, international organizations, and major corporations working on these challenges globally.
