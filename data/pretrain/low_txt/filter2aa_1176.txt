## Background
After completing our previous hacking projects, we decided to explore a new domain. Our goal is to deepen our knowledge and experience in automotive security, an area where our practical experience was limited.

### Areas of Interest
- **Autonomous Vehicles**
  - Tesla Autopilot
  - Comma.io
  - Google Self-Driving Car
  - UBER
- **Connected Cars**
  - Autonomous
  - V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything)
  - V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle)
- **Drive-by-Wire Systems**

### Previous Work in the Field
- Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek
- Troy Hunt and Scott Helme - Nissan Web API Hack
- Kevin Mahaffey and Marc Rogers (Tesla Hack 2015)
- Keen Labs Tesla Hack
- And more...

## Picking Our Battles
### Budget and Starting Point
- **Budget**: Limited
- **Starting Point**: We had already compromised an aftermarket In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system. The next step was to visit a wrecking yard to find a late-model OEM IVI.

### Wrecking Yard Adventure
- **Funny Story**: Looking for a late-model OEM IVI, we found a severely damaged F150 and other squashed cars.
- **Key Takeaway**: A junkyard is not the same as a wrecking yard.

### Initial Setup
- **Dashboard Extraction**: After acquiring the dashboard, we spent a week setting it up.
- **Challenges**: Multiple errors appeared on the instrument panels, and we needed to get the system functional.

### NissanConnect℠ EV
- **Overview**: NissanConnect℠ EV (formerly CARWINGS®) allows users to manage their Nissan LEAF® remotely via a smartphone or computer.
- **Features**:
  - Find nearby charging stations
  - Check battery charge status
  - Remotely start a charging session
  - Get notifications when the battery is fully charged
  - See estimated driving range
  - Adjust car temperature
  - Set reminders to plug in the car

### Next Steps
- **Ownership Transfer**: Attempted to switch owners in the backend, but faced challenges with the title and bill of sale.
- **Previous Experience**: We had previously compromised an IVI system, making it a logical starting point.

## The IVI Attack Surface
- **Operating System**: Windows Automotive 7, which requires a license.
- **Data Extraction**:
  - Navigation system debug data
  - Contacts
  - Waypoints
  - SRAM dump
  - Flash dumps

### Discovering a Web Vulnerability
- **Debug Files Analysis**: Found a URL: "http://biz.nissan-gev.com/WARCondelivbas/it-m_gw10/"
- **WHOIS and Domain Purchase**: Purchased the domain and set up a honeypot on an EC2 instance.
- **Traffic Analysis**: First knock came from Japan, followed by more connections from non-automated tools.

### Data from Connected Cars
- **Data Received**: Location data and other information.
- **VIN Lookup**: Used the VIN to identify the car owner.
- **Reason for Connection**: Owners replacing SIM cards and using the Jasper network.

## Telematics Control Unit (TCU)
- **Continental TCU**: Used as the conduit for the car to connect to the backend.
- **Modem**: Cellular 2G modem.
- **Exploration**:
  - Freescale chip with CAN bus
  - USB and ANT connectors
  - 2G cellular complex

### Gathering Intelligence
- **Firmware Extraction**: Exploited the USB connection to extract firmware.
- **Familiar Chip**: Identified the Infineon PMB 8876.

### Known Vulnerabilities
- **Local Vectors**:
  - AT+STKPROF
  - AT+XAPP
  - AT+XLOG
  - AT+FNS
- **Remote Vector**: Over-The-Air TMSI buffer overflow, confirmed with PoC code and OpenBTS.

### Exploitation
- **Semi-Blind Exploitation**: Extracted firmware without DEP or ASLR.
- **Payload Injection**:
  - Write tag to signify start of data block
  - Copy 512 bytes from arbitrary location into stack frame
  - Write tag to signify completed copy of data block
  - Jump to hardcoded invalid location to force a crash at a specific location
  - Read exception log and extract data
  - Repeat 13,000 times

### Conclusion
- **Future Work**: Reversing the baseband to access the CAN bus.

## Public Statements and Questions
- **Public Statements**: To be announced.
- **Questions**: Open for discussion.
