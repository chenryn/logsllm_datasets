iOS users should be advised to download applications exclusively from the official Apple App Store. Applications distributed through unofficial sources may pose security risks, including the potential to list and access information about installed applications on the device. By using the Apple App Store, users can benefit from Apple's rigorous review process, which helps ensure that apps are free from malicious content.
