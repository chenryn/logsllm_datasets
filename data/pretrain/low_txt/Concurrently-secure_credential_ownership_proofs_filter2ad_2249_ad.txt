### Introduction
This paper aims to bridge a gap in credential systems, specifically between standard signatures and pseudonym systems. Standard signatures offer basic security, while pseudonym systems provide ultimate security and privacy. However, for many applications, the full protection provided by pseudonym systems is unnecessary. Thus, defining and securely designing new schemes that balance efficiency with partial protection remains a challenging open problem.

### Appendix

#### A. The GQ Identification Scheme
**Key Generation:**
- \( (N, e, d) \leftarrow \text{GenRSA}(k) \)
- \( x \xleftarrow{\$} \mathbb{Z}_N^* \), \( X \leftarrow x^e \mod N \)
- \( \text{pk}_{\text{GQ}} \leftarrow (N, e, X) \)
- \( \text{sk}_{\text{GQ}} \leftarrow (N, x) \)

**Verification:**
- \( \text{b} \leftarrow \text{RSA-FDH.Verify}(\text{pk}, m, \sigma) \)
- \( \text{b} \leftarrow \sigma^e \equiv H(m) \mod N \)

Here, \(\text{GenRSA}\) is an RSA modulus generator, which produces an RSA modulus \(N\) and two values \(e\) and \(d\) such that \(e \cdot d \equiv 1 \mod \phi(N)\), where \(\phi\) is the Euler function.

#### D. Proof of Theorem 1
**Proof:**
We construct an \(\text{owe-id-cca}\) adversary \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) attacking IBE-COP and show that \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) can mount a successful attack if \(\mathcal{A}\) succeeds.

In the first phase of the \(\text{owe-id-cca}\) attack, \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) is given the public parameters of IBE and oracle access to the extraction and decryption oracles. At the end of this phase, \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) is expected to decide on the identity it will attack. \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) does this by running \(\mathcal{A}\) as a subroutine.

\(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) first runs \(\mathcal{A}.\hat{V}\) on the public parameters given to it as input. While running, \(\mathcal{A}.\hat{V}\) will make two kinds of requests: signing oracle queries and requests to interact with a clone of an honest prover holding a signature on a message of \(\mathcal{A}.\hat{V}\)'s choice. \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) answers the signing oracle queries using the extraction oracle provided to it, as signing in IBE-COP corresponds to extraction in IBE.

When \(\mathcal{A}.\hat{V}\) asks to have an interaction with a signature holder clone on a message \(m_i\), \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) sets \(\text{ID}_i \leftarrow m_i\) and waits for the first message of interaction. \(\mathcal{A}.\hat{V}\) will send an encrypted challenge and expect to receive the correct decryption. \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) answers the challenge \(C_i\) using its decryption oracle, i.e., queries \((\text{ID}_i, C_i)\) to the decryption oracle and relays the oracle response back to \(\mathcal{A}.\hat{V}\). This way, \(\mathcal{A}.\hat{V}\) will receive what it expects, i.e., the decryption of \(C_i\).

After \(\mathcal{A}.\hat{V}\) has gathered enough information to be able to impersonate, it decides on a target message \(\dot{m}\), declaring that it wants to impersonate a prover holding a signature on the message \(\dot{m}\). \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) now sets the target identity \(\dot{\text{ID}} \leftarrow \dot{m}\) and declares that the first phase of the \(\text{owe-id-cca}\) attack is over.

In the second phase of the \(\text{owe-id-cca}\) attack, \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) is given a challenge ciphertext \(C\) and oracle access to the extraction and decryption oracles and is expected to be able to decrypt the challenge. To do so, \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) runs \(\mathcal{A}.\hat{P}\) in the second phase of the (simulated) \(\text{cop-imp-ca}\) attack. At this stage, the successful \(\mathcal{A}.\hat{P}\) is supposed to be able to impersonate, i.e., to properly respond to a challenge given to it. \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) simply sends the challenge ciphertext \(C\) to \(\mathcal{A}.\hat{P}\) and outputs the obtained response \(R\). If \(\mathcal{A}.\hat{P}\) is successful in impersonation, this response must be the correct decryption of \(C\), which in turn means that \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) will be successful in the \(\text{owe-id-cca}\) attack.

\(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) does not query the decryption oracle in the second phase of the attack, hence there is no \(\text{Dec2}\) query. Besides, it only queries the extraction oracle when \(\mathcal{A}\) asks a signing oracle query. Therefore, it can be easily seen that the success probability of \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) is equal to that of \(\mathcal{A}\). Furthermore, the running times of \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) and \(\mathcal{A}\) are equal. Hence, \(\mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}\) is also poly-time, and we have:
\[ \text{Adv}_{\text{owe-id-cca}}^{\text{IBE}, \mathcal{A}_{\text{IBE}}}(k) = \text{Adv}_{\text{cop-imp-ca}}^{\text{IBE-COP}, \mathcal{A}}(k) \]
