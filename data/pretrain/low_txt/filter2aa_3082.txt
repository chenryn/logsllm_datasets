## Dunning-Kruger Curve
- A visual representation of the curve, highlighting the "Peak of Stupidity" and the journey towards competence.

## Part I: Jumping Air-Gaps
### Techniques
- **A Sensor Darkly**: Using Ambient Light Sensors (ALS) for command execution.
- **Dreadphone**: Near-ultrasonic sound for Command and Control (C2).
- **Spectregram**: Visualizing sound data for exfiltration.

### Caveats
- Most research assumes the attacker has already infected at least one host.
- Physical or near-physical access is required.
- Exfiltration involves small pieces of data.

- **Hasan et al (2013)**: Overview of techniques, including ALS for mobile devices

### Ambient Light Sensor (ALS)
- Common in laptops, monitors, smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches.

### A Sensor Darkly
- **Plan**: Create malware to read light (lux) values from the ALS through the API.
- **Execution**: Malware executes different commands based on changes in light intensity.
- **Challenges**: Need to avoid obvious detection and ensure exfiltration capability.

### Dreadphone
- **C2 using near-ultrasonic sounds (16-20kHz)**: Standard laptop soundcard.
- **Research**: Toftsed et al (2010) - Army Research Laboratory, Hanspach and Goetz (2014) - Covert acoustical mesh networks.

### Spectregram
- **Visualization**: Convert sound data into visual formats for exfiltration.

### Mitigation
- **TEMPEST standards**: Remove or disable ALS, use screen filters, white noise, ultrasonic detectors, and disable microphones/speakers.

## Part II: Surveillance and Counter-Surveillance
### Techniques
- **Laser Microphone**: Converting sound to light and back.
- **Passive Infrared Motion Detector**: Bypass methods.
- **Drone to Clone to Pwn**: Cloning and exploiting signals.
- **Phone to Clone to Pwn**: Similar to drone cloning.
- **Active Infrared Motion Detector**: Detection and countermeasures.

### Sniffing, Analyzing, and Cloning IR Signals
- **Similar to RF signals**: Assuming fixed codes, listen, analyze, and replay signals on an Arduino.
- **Tools**: RTL-SDR, rtl_ir, IRLib library.
- **Example**: NEC 0x2FD48B7 (standby signal from a TV remote).

### Passive IR Motion Detectors
- **Bypasses**: Move slowly, mask body heat, overwhelm sensor with heat.
- **References**: Porter and Smith (2013).

### Drone and Phone Cloning
- **Cloning and Exploitation**: Use drones and phones to clone and exploit signals.

### Active IR Motion Detector
- **Mitigation**: Vibrations, speakers, wire screens, unfiltered cameras, double-glazing, curved glass, physical keypads, and encrypted rolling code algorithms.

## Part III: Bantz (Fun and Games)
### Techniques
- **DoubleSpeak**: Delayed Auditory Feedback (speech jamming).
- **Annoying Malware Analysts**: Psychological warfare in reverse engineering.
- **Kill More Gilmore**: Automatically turn off the TV when the Gilmore Girls theme song plays.
- **AstroDrone**: Ultrasonic attacks on drones.

### DoubleSpeak
- **Speech Jamming**: Software version inspired by Kurihara and Tsukada (2012).

### Demotivating Malware Analysts
- **Inspiration**: Domas (2015) - Creating malware where the flow graph represents an image.

### Kill More Gilmore
- **Function**: Automatically turns off the TV when the Gilmore Girls theme song plays.
- **Purpose**: A humorous and practical application.

### AstroDrone
- **Effects**: Launches the drone upwards or causes it to stick to the floor without crashing.
- **Research**: Liu et al (2016), Robinson (2015), Son et al (2015), Luo (2016).

### Animal Repellent Alarm
- **PIR Sensor**: Sends out an ultrasonic pulse if high, adjustable frequency (0-50kHz), and sensitivity.

### Real-World Applications
- **Deploy on roofs**: Prisons, government buildings, public events.
- **Further Research**: Personal drone protection.

## Part IV: Summary
### Research Overview
- **Ultrasound Malware**: ALS malware, laser microphone, active IR detector, passive IR detector, Kill More Gilmore, drones, speech jamming, spectregram, light sensors, IR sniffing, IR replay, ultrasound, delivery, IR detection.

### Pros & Cons
- **Pros**: Great for physical engagements, difficult to detect, minimal trace, cheap to design and develop.
- **Cons**: Requires proximity, subject to interference, range and power depend on resources.

### Mitigation
- **Awareness**: Know these techniques and attacks exist.
- **Block Inputs/Outputs**: Ensure reliable failover, be aware of clone-and-replay attacks, and limitations of security products.

### Future Research
- **Exfiltration via IR**: Acoustic keylogging, LiFi, drone repellents, tracking and targeting, identification through video, combination of infrared and sound.
