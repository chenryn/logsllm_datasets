## Introduction
This document presents an analysis of automated attacks on PassPoints-style graphical passwords. The study evaluates the effectiveness of different click-order patterns and visual attention models in reducing the dictionary size while maintaining or improving the attack's success rate.

## Discussion

The presented models are top-down approaches under various plausible assumptions, potentially offering a more accurate representation of user choice. For instance, the first point might be chosen based on bottom-up visual attention, followed by subsequent points selected in a top-down manner to ensure similarity. Alternatively, the entire process could be top-down, where users select five objects that are similar in some way. Such a model would be more challenging to attack but, if implemented, could provide valuable insights.

### Enhancements to Distinguishable Points Map (δ)

The distinguishable points map can be enhanced in several ways:
- Incorporating additional types of calculable points (e.g., north, south, east, west on circles and squares).
- Adjusting parameters for algorithms used to identify distinguishable points.
- Modifying parameters for the visual attention model.
- Exploring whether settings can be optimized for a wide range of images or if they are highly image-specific.

### Image-Independent Attacks

For image-independent attacks relying on generic patterns and window clustering, exploring other patterns may yield better results. Our current results show significant improvement over previous work, with a dictionary of 235 entries (αDIAG++) guessing over 48% of user passwords for two images, compared to 0.9-9.1% [27] and 8% [10] in previous studies.

### Concluding Remarks

We have developed what appears to be the most effective automated attack against PassPoints-style graphical passwords to date. Combining click-order patterns (DIAG and LINE) with our laziest relaxation rule resulted in highly effective dictionaries. Using Itti et al.’s [15] computational model of bottom-up visual attention, we further reduced the dictionary size while retaining accuracy.

For the "pool" image, the V A1-DIAG++ dictionary guessed 15.8% of passwords with 230.3 entries, and for the "cars" image, it guessed 16.5% with about 231.4 entries. This is comparable to human-seeded attacks, which guessed 20% of passwords with 233 entries [27]. This suggests that automated attacks are a viable alternative to human-seeded attacks, allowing for continued attacks without the need for human indexing, especially with large image datasets.

### Evaluation of Visual Attention Models

Using Itti’s model, we found that no user passwords in the database followed the scan-path order within the first 30 steps. However, some passwords were composed of points within other orderings of the scan-path elements. This indicates that bottom-up visual attention is one part of a broader criteria for selecting click-points, or that these points might be chosen according to another phenomenon intersecting with this model.

### Future Work

It remains unclear how universal the inducement of users to fall into click-order patterns is across a broad range of images. Further research is needed to determine if image processing measures can effectively filter out images prone to structure-based click-order patterns.
