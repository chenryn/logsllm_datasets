### Apex [28] and Context-Based Access Control

Apex [28] extends the Android operating system by introducing conditional permissions, thereby providing a degree of support for context-based access control. This is achieved by allowing users to define context-dependent resource restrictions, such as those based on the time of day. However, these systems, including MOSES, TrustDroid, and Apex, heavily rely on user- or pre-defined rules. In contrast, our work leverages dynamic context classification using machine learning to enforce access control. Additionally, our access control architecture is built on the more generic and flexible FlaskDroid platform [7], which can cover most of the use cases described in Saint.

### Recent Patent Application by Bell et al. [5]

A recent patent application by Bell et al. [5] discloses a system that uses context-triggered policies to control the access of applications to sensors and other resources on a smartphone. Their approach also relies on either pre-defined policies or policies uploaded to the devices by external entities.

### User Authentication on Mobile Devices

Riva et al. [31] address the problem of more usable user authentication on mobile devices by using various contextual clues to partially authenticate the user. They estimate the likelihood that the user is in proximity and use this information to configure the device lock. Similarly, Hayashi et al. [19] introduce Context-Aware Scalable Authentication (CASA), which uses the device's location within a probabilistic framework to determine the active authentication factors (e.g., PIN or password) to be used on smartphones. Although our work covers a similar use case, it differs in that we do not authenticate the user but rather adjust the device locking behavior based on the automatic classification of the context according to its perceived risk level.

### Time-Based Clustering and Stay Points

Kang et al. [22] introduced the concept of time-based clustering of position observations, which Zheng et al. [46] further developed into the concepts of stay points and stay regions. Montoliu et al. [26] extended this work. We adopt a slightly modified version of the notion of stay regions to define our GPS-based Contexts of Interest (CoIs). Additionally, we extend the concept of stay points to non-locational data, specifically WiFi stay points. Dousse et al. [14] have demonstrated the use of WiFi fingerprints for identifying and detecting places based on WiFi. We adopt a simplified version of their place identification scheme, considering only intersections of WiFi snapshots for our WiFi-based CoI detection.

### Context Profiling and Safety Estimation

Gupta et al. [17] were the first to use context profiling and the notion of CoIs and device familiarity to estimate the 'safety' level of a context. Their system relied on a simple heuristic model based on time-discounted familiarity measures and required a fixed threshold for distinguishing between context classes, which failed to account for context- and user-specific differences. Our approach, however, applies a sophisticated context model and more powerful machine learning models for context classification, enabling us to better account for these differences in perceptions of risk level and privacy exposure.

### Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we presented ConXsense, a context-aware access control framework for mobile devices that utilizes automated classification of contexts based on sensed context data. We applied it to two concrete smartphone-related use cases: defending against sensory malware and preventing device misuse. We demonstrated that context classification can effectively address true security concerns that smartphone users face. Our approach is not merely a prediction problem but a continuous process of learning from and adapting to the individual needs and preferences of smartphone users.

Having validated the effectiveness of ConXsense, the next step is to evaluate its usability. We plan to implement on-device versions of the Profiler and Classifier and create a mobile app for user studies focusing on the usability aspects related to our framework. We also intend to develop richer context models incorporating more context sensors and addressing other context-aware access control use cases.
