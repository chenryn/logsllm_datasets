## Background
- To prevent fraudulent activities such as phishing and spyware, many banks in Japan have implemented various security measures.
- Unfortunately, these measures have often failed to protect customers from crime.
- This presentation will explore both the positive and negative aspects of these security practices.

## History
- **1997/01:** Sumitomo Bank launched the first net-banking service.
- **2000/01:** The first bank to provide all services via the internet was established.
- **2005:** Phishing fraud emails posing as Mega-Bank (Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ) were discovered.
- **2006:** The first damage from phishing fraud was reported at E-bank (Rakuten Bank, today).
- **2007:** Phishing fraud sites that required users to enter all numbers on a Bingo Card were found at Shinsei Bank (First Case).
- **2011:** Simultaneous multiple phishing frauds (using spyware) targeting regional banks occurred in the latter half of the year.
- **2012:** Phishing fraud sites requiring all numbers on a Bingo Card were found at three major banks.
- **2013 (as of April end):** The defrauded amount exceeded 100 million JPY (approximately 30 million NTD).

## Data and Statistics (as of 31/03/2012, FISC Research)
- **Number of Banks Offering Internet Banking:** 411
- **Number of Accounts:** 60,258,506
- **Approximately half of the population in Japan has a net-banking account.**

### Damage Statistics
- **Internet Banking:**
  - **2010:** 78 cases, 88 million JPY
  - **2011:** 162 cases, 402 million JPY
  - **2012 (Apr-Dec):** 91 cases, 68 million JPY
- **Use of Fake Cash Cards:**
  - **2010:** 272 cases, 248 million JPY
  - **2011:** 477 cases, 320 million JPY
  - **2012 (Apr-Dec):** 670 cases, 583 million JPY
- **Cash Card Theft:**
  - **2010:** 6,589 cases, 3,888 million JPY
  - **2011:** 5,289 cases, 2,856 million JPY
  - **2012 (Apr-Dec):** 2,853 cases, 1,227 million JPY

- **Comparison:** The damage from cash card theft is about 20 times higher than that from internet banking.

## Light and Shadow of Net-Banking Security Practices

### Screen Keyboard
- **Light:**
  - Popular in Japan.
  - Effective against software keyloggers.
- **Shadow:**
  - Breached multiple times.
  - Weak against Remote Access Trojan horses (RAT).
  - Inconvenient to use.
  - Example: Ultimate Screen Keyboard (Mitsui Sumitomo Banking)

### Eliminating Popup Windows
- **Light:**
  - Prevents XSS and man-in-the-browser attacks.
- **Shadow:**
  - Major banks prefer popup windows, leading to inconsistencies.
  - Can hide URL bars, making it easier for phishing.
  - Example: Bad case with caution for malfunctioning popup windows.

### S/MIME Mail
- **Light:**
  - Ensures message integrity and non-compromise.
  - Easy and inexpensive to adopt.
- **Shadow:**
  - Most consumers do not understand S/MIME.
  - Often mistaken for malware.
  - Does not work with Gmail.
  - Minimal benefit for the cost.

### Password Reminder
- **Light:**
  - Uses personal information to identify users.
- **Shadow:**
  - Easily crackable by checking social media.
  - Example: Junior high school student cracked a password using SNS information.
  - Fixed question patterns are predictable.

### One-Time Password (Bingo Card)
- **Light:**
  - Requires specifying different cells randomly.
  - Eavesdropping on passwords is less effective.
- **Shadow:**
  - Some banks do not limit reloading times.
  - If the card has too few numbers, it can be reproduced.
  - Example: Phishing site requiring all numbers on a Bingo Card.

### One-Time Password (Sent by Email)
- **Light:**
  - Virtual two-factor authentication.
  - Expires after a certain period.
  - Lower cost compared to token-based solutions.
- **Shadow:**
  - Eavesdropping by spyware can still be effective.
  - Several cases of successful phishing (e.g., Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ).

### Secure Browser
- **Light:**
  - Potential trump card if all banks adopt it.
- **Shadow:**
  - Difficult to prove its validity.
  - Hard to install for non-technical users.
  - Can be easily faked.
  - Example: Fake browser with assurance phrases.

### PIN (4 Digits)
- **Light:**
  - Can be changed on ATMs without talking to representatives.
- **Shadow:**
  - Cannot force change.
  - Some customers, especially seniors and patients, have difficulty using ATMs.
  - Date of birth is a common choice and easily guessable.

### Telephone Banking
- **Light:**
  - Limits functions to reduce fraud.
- **Shadow:**
  - Authentication information can be gained.
  - No limit on PIN entry attempts.
  - Example: Critical point in security.

## Cost and Work Amount
- **Bingo Card Delivery:** High cost and logistical challenges.
- **Inactive Accounts and Address Changes:** Significant issues.
- **OTP via Email:** More cost-effective solution.

## Business Strategy
- **Strategy 1:**
  - Net banking services were offered to all new account holders based on the myth of "eternal growth."
  - Most people do not use these services.
- **Strategy 2:**
  - Banks follow what others are doing.
  - Differentiation is intended but not achieved.
  - Customers expect banks to offer the same services as competitors.

## Power Balance Against Systems Integrators
- **Structure:**
  - Banking systems are a lucrative business for systems integrators.
  - Banks rely heavily on integrators for security solutions.
- **Result:**
  - Banks do not need to understand information security deeply.
  - Systems integrators provide "easy-to-understand" solutions.
  - Risk analysis is often overlooked.

## Studies and Solutions
- **Design Principles:**
  - Security should be designed and applied without exceptions.
  - Avoid differentiation to prevent confusion and vulnerabilities.
- **Service Deployment:**
  - Simple services like balance checks should be available.
  - Credit card payments can be used for wire transfers to limit damage.
- **Risk Management:**
  - Banks should not rely solely on systems integrators for security.

## Conclusion
- **Email:** [Your Email]

- **Twitter:** @aido_hpf

- **In Taiwan:** Internet banking services are provided only to those who need them, using IC cards and card readers. This is a good practice.
- **Recommendation:** Banks should focus on providing services to those who need them and manage their security risks more effectively.
