### 4G LTE Control-Plane Key Reinstallation Attacks: Feasibility and Negative Impact

#### 5.1.1 Abnormal Cases in TAU and Detach Procedures

The 3GPP LTE NAS standard [6] discusses two specific cases related to the Tracking Area Update (TAU) and Detach procedures.

**First Case: Abnormal TAU Procedure**
The first case is defined as an abnormal scenario in the TAU procedure, where the network must abort the TAU and process a Detach Request message from the device. The 3GPP standard [6] states:
"If the device receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the tracking area updating procedure has been completed, the tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted, and the detach procedure shall be progressed."

**Second Case: Integrity Check Failure**
In the second scenario, the network finds that the Detach Request message has failed the integrity check. Despite this, the 3GPP standard requires that the Detach Request message (with cause "power off") must still be processed. The LTE NAS specification [6] states:
"The procedure is completed when the network receives the DETACH REQUEST message. On reception of a DETACH REQUEST message indicating 'switch off', the MME shall delete the current EPS security context."

It is important to note that this special case only applies to Detach Requests with the reason "power-off." Otherwise, the network will first complete the TAU procedure before processing the Detach Request.

#### No LTE Service

When the network receives a Detach Request message with the cause "power off," it re-authenticates the victim device and then releases the device connection by deleting its sessions and freeing its IP address. The device, unaware that its network registration has terminated, sends a Service Request message when it needs to send data or initiate a call. Upon receiving the Service Request message from the victim device, the core network rejects the request with error cause #43 (Invalid EPS bearer identity). According to the 3GPP NAS specification [6]:
"The UE shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the received EPS bearer identity, stop any related timer, and deactivate the corresponding EPS bearer context locally (without peer-to-peer signaling between the UE and the MME)."

At this point, the victim device enters a deregistered state. To regain LTE service, the user must manually register the device with the network (by rebooting the device or toggling the airplane mode), otherwise, LTE service remains unavailable.

### 6. Discussion

We propose remedies for key reinstallation attacks and discuss the security analysis of these proposed solutions.

#### 6.1 Proposed Remedies

To address the discussed vulnerabilities and attacks, we suggest the following LTE standard-compliant remedies:

1. **Bounding Key Installation and Count Reset Procedures:**
   One of the root causes of control-plane attacks is the disjoint execution of key installation and count reset procedures. To mitigate this, we bind the LTE NAS Authentication (which installs the key) and the NAS Security Mode Command (which resets the count) procedures. Specifically, we perform the LTE Authentication procedure whenever the Security Mode Command procedure fails, making the security procedures atomic. In the LTE Authentication procedure, the network sends an Authentication Request message and starts timer T3460 (default value of 6 seconds). The timer is stopped when the network receives the Security Mode Complete message from the device, rather than at the Authentication Response. This ensures that the Authentication procedure fails if the Security Mode Command procedure fails, thus binding these two procedures. Our approach addresses vulnerability 1 by making key installation and count reset procedures atomic; i.e., either both succeed or none do.

2. **Enforcing Integrity Protection for All Signaling Messages:**
   Another root cause of control-plane attacks is that certain messages (e.g., TAU and Detach Request) are partially accepted even if their integrity check fails. Although the network authenticates the device afterward, it does not validate whether the received signaling message was indeed originated by the authenticated device. We mitigate this vulnerability by enabling the device to reject any signaling messages that fail the integrity check once the security association has been established. Instead, the network should reject the message and re-authenticate the device. Present 3GPP specifications generate an integrity failure message response for selected signaling procedures. To provide integrity check failure feedback for all types of signaling messages, we propose that the network should reject the signaling message with error cause #9 (UE identity cannot be derived by the network). Upon receiving this error message, the device re-registers with the network after executing both authentication and security mode procedures. Our standard-compliant solution may delay LTE service for a few seconds but enforces LTE security at all times, thus mitigating vulnerability 2, where messages failing the integrity check are always re-executed.

#### 6.2 Security Analysis through Prototyping

We provide a security analysis of our proposal by developing a proof-of-concept prototype without creating interaction between the victim and the attacker. We use AT commands to emulate the network enforcing the above principles to mitigate vulnerabilities 1 to 3. Although there are hundreds of AT commands, only a few have the privilege to execute over commercial handsets. We create our prototype using those AT commands that our program can execute on commercial phones (such as Google Pixel or Samsung Galaxy devices).

In our experiment, we check whether the subscriber device is under a jamming attack. If the signals are jammed to launch key reinstallation attacks by resetting counts, we re-activate LTE bearers to re-establish security by renewing the key. When the device makes a voice call through CSFB, our program checks for LTE registration by running the "at+creg?" and "at+cgdcont?" commands. The "at+creg?" command tells whether the device is PLMN registered and, if true, whether it is registered with the LTE network. The "at+cgdcont?" command outputs the IP and APN name, which indicates the cellular radio access technology the device is using. For example, fast.tmobile.com indicates that the device is registered with the LTE APN over the T-Mobile carrier network. Thereafter, our program sends the "at+cgdata=“PPP", 1" command to establish the data connection with the network. If the data request is not entertained, the device AT command returns an error, indicating that the data connection request has failed due to jamming. On receiving the error message, our program waits for 2 seconds before running the "at+cgdata" command again. If the error persists, we renew the key by re-activating the LTE service. We run "at+cops=2" immediately followed by "at+cops=0,1" to force the device to reselect the LTE network and perform the re-authentication procedure.

### 7. Related Work

We compare our work with existing research on key reinstallation attacks and LTE security.

**Key Reinstallation Attacks:**
- [28] discusses key reinstallation attacks on Voice over LTE and the inability to decrypt LTE signaling messages. [28] demonstrates the feasibility of the attack arising from LTE bearer assignment with IMS. In contrast, we demonstrate key reinstallation on the control plane.
- The closest work to ours is the key reinstallation attack in WiFi [11, 32, 35]. Mathy et al. [35] recently showed a variant of key reinstallation attack in the WiFi signaling plane, exposing design and implementation issues in WiFi security protocols.
- [11] discusses passive and active attacks due to keystream reuses in WEP. [32] shows key recovery attacks on WEP. Our work, while in a similar direction, is different as we focus on key reinstallation attacks in the LTE control plane, even though LTE never reuses the same key and employs separate keys and counters for encryption and integrity protection.

**Other Works:**
- [40] discusses count reset due to power failure.
- [10] discusses the use of static counters due to implementation bugs.
- [9, 12] discuss faulty state machine transitions leading to count resets.
- [8] discusses count resets through routing protocols.
- [36] discusses side-channel attacks on CBC mode with a block cipher.

Contrary to these works, our study focuses on LTE design flaws that reset counter values, leading to key-reinstallation attacks. Our attacks are neither implementation bugs nor due to careless design choices but highlight security loopholes in seemingly secure protocols.

**LTE Security:**
- [14, 27, 29] conduct LTE protocol vulnerability analysis and show real impacts on LTE subscribers.
- LTEInspector [14] cannot detect key reinstallation vulnerabilities because retransmission of lost messages is a valid behavior, and it is hard to automate the impact of these lost messages on LTE security.
- [27] discusses LTE inter-protocol vulnerabilities where the adversary can spoof LTE messages. Their attacks were not practical as the network rejects the attacker-originated message (C-RNTI and TMSI do not match).
- [29] shows MitM attacks to exploit LTE layer two vulnerabilities, mostly passive in nature, such as mapping device activities and performing website fingerprinting.
- [13] shows that LTE temporary identity can disclose subscriber location.
- [30] unveils that signaling information can be leveraged to infer user privacy.
- [26] shows that current cellular infrastructures exhibit security loopholes due to NAT/firewall settings.
- [24, 25] study insecurity in mobile data charging.
- [17, 18] discuss how a subscriber can inject control-plane traffic into the user-plane.

Unlike the above works, we do not discuss vulnerabilities due to misconfigurations or implementation bugs.

### 8. Conclusion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate key reinstallation attacks in the LTE control plane. The retransmission of certain signaling messages resets the counter values multiple times, leading to the reuse of key stream blocks for ciphering plain text messages. As a result, the attacker can hijack the LTE location update procedure and de-register the victim device from the network.
