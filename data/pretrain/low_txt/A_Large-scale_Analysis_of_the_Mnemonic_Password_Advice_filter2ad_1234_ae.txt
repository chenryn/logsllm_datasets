### D. Comparison to Uniform Distribution

The uniform password distribution is the strongest among all distributions with the same number of elements. However, mnemonic password distributions fall short of this ideal for three primary reasons:
1. Some characters occur more frequently than others.
2. Characters in a password are not independent of each other.
3. The character distributions depend on their position within the password.

Table VIII illustrates the exploitation of these three effects step by step for standard mnemonic passwords. In addition to the Shannon entropy \( H_1 \), the table also shows the perplexity \( Ppl. = 2^{H_1} \), which represents the number of elements in a uniform distribution with the same entropy.

According to the results in Table VIII, both password distributions provide approximately the same level of security as a uniform distribution over 12 to 13 characters in an offline scenario. The most significant effect in both cases is the non-uniform distribution of characters. On the other hand, exploiting the differences in character distributions by position (using position-dependent models, as discussed in Section IV-B) is particularly valuable for ASCII passwords, where it can nearly reduce their strength to that of lowercase letter passwords. As discussed in Section V-A, ASCII passwords are only stronger than lowercase letter passwords under specific generation rules.

### E. Comparison to Dictionary Passwords

While the following discussion exemplifies how our strength estimates can be used to compare the strength of different password generation methods, it does not incorporate other important factors for password usage, such as memorability, typing convenience, or susceptibility to typing errors. Unfortunately, we are not aware of any comprehensive comparison that includes these factors.

A second prominent suggestion for password generation is to pick several words uniformly at random from a large dictionary [29], [33]. We use the 7776-word Diceware dictionary [33] as an example.

The strength of such dictionary-based passwords is straightforward to compute. The min-entropy and Shannon entropy are both equal to:

\[ H_{\infty} = H_1 = n \cdot \log_2(7776) \]

The failure probability is calculated by:

\[ \lambda_{\beta} = 1 - \left( \frac{\beta}{7776} \right)^n \]

The maximum length of a word in the dictionary is 6 characters. On average, the created passwords have a length of \( n \cdot 4.24 + (n - 1) \), where \( (n - 1) \) is the number of space characters, as illustrated on the Diceware homepage.

The comparison with Diceware highlights the relative weakness of mnemonic passwords against online attacks: even a 2-word Diceware password distribution achieves a failure probability \( \lambda_{100} \) of 0.999998, making it considerably stronger in this scenario than any rule we considered, while requiring an average of only 9.5 characters.

However, mnemonic passwords provide better security in the offline scenario for the same password length. For example, 3 Diceware words (average password length of 14.7 characters) achieve 38.8 bits of Shannon entropy, which is already reached by lowercase letter mnemonic passwords of minimum length 9 (Table VII, average length of 10.4 characters).

### F. Comparison to Real-world Password Distributions

This section compares the strength estimates for mnemonic passwords with estimates for real-world password distributions from the literature.

The largest-scale password strength analysis of real-world passwords is the analysis of 70 million anonymized Yahoo! passwords by Bonneau [3], which provides the following estimates: min-entropy \( H_{\infty} \approx 6.5 \), failure probability with 10 guesses \( \lambda_{10} \approx 0.98178 \), and work factor \( \mu_{0.5} \approx 2,111,739 \). While no estimate for the Shannon Entropy \( H_1 \) is provided, we can apply the log-linear relationship of \( \mu_{0.5} \) and \( H_1 \) observed for mnemonic passwords, suggesting an \( H_1 \) of ~27 bits (cf. Figure 5).

Bonneau also compares the Yahoo! estimates to estimates from the password lists leaked from the RockYou and Battlefield Heroes websites. He finds that the corresponding two password distributions are even weaker against offline attacks. Only the Battlefield Heroes passwords are stronger against online attacks (\( H_{\infty} \approx 7.7 \), \( \lambda_{10} \approx 0.98878 \)).

Comparing these estimates for real-world password distributions with our estimates for mnemonic passwords, we see that mnemonic passwords are considerably stronger against both online and offline attacks. For online attacks, our estimates for the standard lowercase letters word initial rule are for \( H_{\infty} \) between 11.4 and 12.8, and for \( \lambda_{10} \) between 0.99912 and 0.99928 (Table VI)—reducing the corresponding success probability (1 - \( \lambda_{10} \)) compared to the Battlefield Heroes passwords by 92–94%. For offline attacks, we can extend Table VII for smaller \( l_{min} \), suggesting that a higher \( H_1 \) as for real-world passwords is reached by mnemonic passwords from the standard rule with a minimum length \( l_{min} \) of 5. While the length distribution of the Yahoo! passwords is unknown, the current minimum password length for new Yahoo! accounts is 8 and thus considerably larger. Therefore, we can conclude that mnemonic passwords are stronger against both online and offline attacks compared to the passwords in use today.
