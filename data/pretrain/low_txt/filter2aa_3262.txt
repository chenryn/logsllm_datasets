### Conclusion

**Execution Tips:**
- Use CA glue and baking soda.
- This is not a fast process.
- When building with imprecise and/or unknown final measurements, don’t be greedy with the material.
- Don’t forget about structure.
- Fail. Fail a lot.

**Why "MacGyver" Stuff?**
- Improved critical thinking skills
- Practical engineering experience

**Parting Challenge:**
- Never stop building stuff.
- Your quirky, offbeat, “too much time on your hands” side project doesn’t have to measure up to anything.
- You don’t have to change the world to establish a precedent.
- It just has to be done. No one can undo that.

**Thanks!**
