### Examples of Invalid TLDs
- `instagram`
- `localdomain`

- `0`
- `big`

### Normalization of Subdomains
To control for varying subdomain lengths, we first normalize all lists to unique base domains. For example, this reduces the Umbrella list to 273,000 base domains (refer to µBD in Table 2).

|----------|--------------|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|------------|--------|----------|
| Alexa 1M AL0912 | 248 ± 2 | 973k ± 2k | ≈0% | 1.6% | 0.4% | 47k ± 2k | 23k | n/a |

| Alexa 1M AL18 | 771 ± 8 | 962k ± 4k | ≈0% | 2.6% | ≈0% | 45k ± 1k | 483k | 121k |
| Alexa 1M JOINT | 760 ± 11 | 972k ± 7k | 49.9% | 14.7% | 5.9% | 51k ± 4k | 147k | 38k |

### Dataset Intersections
- Alexa and Umbrella agree on 150,000 domains.
- Umbrella and Majestic agree on 113,000 domains.
- All three lists agree on 99,000 domains out of 1,000,000.

For the Top 1,000 lists:
- During the JOINT period, Alexa and Majestic agree on 295 domains.
- Alexa and Umbrella agree on 56 domains.
- Majestic and Umbrella agree on 65 domains.
- All three lists agree on 47 domains.

This disparity suggests a high bias in list creation. Even the web-based lists, Alexa and Majestic, only share an average of 29% of domains.

### Alexa List Change
- In January 2018, the Alexa list changed, reducing the average intersection with Majestic from 285,000 to 240,000.
- This change introduced a weekly pattern, making the list more volatile and susceptible to weekly patterns.
- We speculate that Alexa might have reduced its 3-month sliding window, making the list more volatile.

### Studying Top List Discrepancies
The low intersection between Umbrella and the other lists could be due to the DNS vs. web-based creation. Our hypothesis is that web-based lists like Alexa and Majestic miss domains providing embedded content and those popular on mobile applications.

### Analysis of Disjunct Domains
- We aggregated the Alexa, Umbrella, and Majestic Top 1,000 domains from the last week of April 2018.
- 40.7% of these domains originate from Alexa, 37.1% from Umbrella, and 22.1% from Majestic.
- We identified whether disjunct domains are associated with mobile traffic or third-party advertising and tracking services.
- We used data from the Lumen Privacy Monitor and popular anti-tracking blacklists such as MalwareBytes’ hpHosts ATS file.

### Table 3: Share of One-Week Top 1,000 Disjunct Domains
| **List** | **# Disjunct** | **% hpHosts** | **% Lumen** | **% Top 1M** |
|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Alexa    | 1,224          | 25.63%        | 93.63%      | 99.10%       |
| Umbrella | 1,116          | 3.10%         | 20.16%      | 1.95%        |
| Majestic | 665            | 1.55%         | 39.43%      | 3.76%        |

Umbrella has significantly more domains flagged as "mobile traffic" and third-party advertising and tracking services than the other lists. It also has the lowest proportion of domains shared with other Top 1,000,000 lists.

### Stability of Top Lists
We now focus on the stability of top lists over time. Research has revealed hourly, daily, and weekly patterns in ISP traffic and service load, as well as significant regional and demographic differences in accessed content.

### Daily Changes
- The Majestic list is very stable (6,000 daily changes).
- The Umbrella list offers significant churn (118,000 daily changes).
- The Alexa list was stable (21,000 daily changes) but drastically changed in January 2018 (483,000 daily changes), becoming the most unstable list.

### Intersection and Temporal Decay
- We computed the intersection between a fixed starting day and upcoming days, showing long-term trends in temporal decay.
- For Alexa and Umbrella, the decay is non-monotonic, with domains leaving and rejoining at weekly intervals.

### Domain Persistence
- About 90% of domains in the Alexa Top 1,000,000 list are included for 50 or fewer days.
- 40% of domains in the Majestic Top 1,000,000 list remain in the list across the full year.
- The Majestic Top 1,000 list is the most stable, followed by Majestic Top 1,000,000, Umbrella Top 1,000, Alexa Top 1,000, Umbrella Top 1,000,000, and Alexa Top 1,000,000.

### Weekly Patterns
- The weekly patterns in the Alexa and Umbrella lists show that list content depends on the day of the week.
- We calculated weekday and weekend distributions of domain ranks and computed the distance between them using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.

### Rank Changes
- Previous studies show that the distribution of accessed domains follows a power-law distribution.
- Figure 1c shows instability increasing with higher ranks for Alexa and Umbrella, but not for Majestic.
- The Alexa list's instability increased from 0.62% to 7.7% after January 2018.

### New or Rejoining Domains
- Daily changes in top lists may stem from new domains joining or previously contained domains re-joining.
- Majestic exhibits linear growth, adding about 2,000 new domains per day.
- Umbrella adds about 20,000 new domains per day.
- Alexa grows by 5,000 (of 21,000) and 121,000 (of 483,000) domains per day, before and after its structural change in January 2018.
