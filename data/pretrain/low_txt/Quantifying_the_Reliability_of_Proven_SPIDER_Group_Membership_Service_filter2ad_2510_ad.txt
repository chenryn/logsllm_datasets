## Symmetric Faults (Table 4)
- **Overall Reliability:**
  - The overall reliability for symmetric faults is better than for 100% asymmetric fault experiments.
  - **All Permanent Policy:**
    - Over 50% of the design points have a BER of 10^-3 or higher.
  - **All Transient Policy:**
    - The majority of design points (20.8%, 27.8%, and 22.9%) fall within the range of 10^-3 to 10^-9.
  - **Perfect Policy:**
    - This policy has a slightly higher percentage of design points at the highest reliability level compared to the All Transient policy.
  - **Conclusion:**
    - All three policies have design points at both the highest and lowest reliability levels, indicating that parameter selection is crucial.

## Benign Faults (Table 5)
- **Characteristics:**
  - Benign faults are the least harmful among the three types.
  - **All Permanent Policy:**
    - Over 50% of the design points have a BER of 10^-3 or higher.
  - **All Transient and All Permanent Policies:**
    - These policies have the same distribution because convicting benign faulty nodes offers no benefit.
  - **Majority of Design Points:**
    - The majority of design points for these two policies are at 10^-11 or better.

## Related Work
- **Assumption Coverage:**
  - Researchers emphasize the need to critically examine how system assumptions withstand expected fault conditions.
  - **Powell's Concept:**
    - Introduced the concept of assumption coverage, which balances the risk of uncovered faults against the risk of increased failure rates due to redundancy.
    - **Definition:**
      - "Failure mode assumption coverage (px) is the probability that the assertion X defining the assumed behavior of a component is true in practice, given that the component has failed: px = Pr{X = true|component failed}." [13]
    - **Paradox:**
      - Weakening assumptions may lower reliability, as more redundancy increases fault rates.
  - **Cukier and Powell:**
    - Discussed using testing data to estimate assumption coverage [6].
  - **Bauer, Kopetz, and Puschner:**
    - Noted the need to measure how systems withstand multiple faults, even with the weakest assumptions.
    - **Observation:**
      - Even an optimal system architecture with 100% assumption coverage for tolerated failure modes cannot have 100% coverage for coincident faults [2].

## Asymmetric Faults (Table 3)
- **Assumption Violations per Hour:**
  - **All Permanent:**
    - 168 (58.3%) design points with violations ≥ 10^-3.
  - **All Transient:**
    - 141 (49.0%) design points with violations ≥ 10^-3.
  - **Perfect:**
    - 0 (0%) design points with violations ≥ 10^-3.

## Conclusions
- **Reliability of Proof Assumptions:**
  - Measuring the reliability of proof assumptions is valuable.
  - **SPIDER Group Membership Service:**
    - Modeled the probability of assumption violations for 12,600 configurations, focusing on transient faults and three fault types (asymmetric, symmetric, and benign).
  - **Impact:**
    - Analysis at the design stage allows for policy trade-offs and predicts system performance under various fault conditions.
  - **Case Studies:**
    - Determined the expected Maximum Fault Assumption violations per hour for 3,024 configurations.
    - Examined the trade-off between all-permanent and all-transient policies for 10,800 configurations.
    - Tested assumption reliability for 3,024 configurations, showing significant differences between asymmetric and symmetric/benign cases.
  - **Future Work:**
    - Measure assumption reliability for other safety-critical protocols, such as TTP/C and FlexRay.
