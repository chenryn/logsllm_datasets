**Title: Black Hat Asia 2020 - Winning the 0-Day Race Against Botnets in Public Clouds**

Botnets pose a significant threat to public cloud environments, often exploiting new vulnerabilities (0-days) to disrupt large parts of the internet. As a cloud service provider, we have developed an automated 0-day monitoring solution to detect and block these attacks before they can be launched by botnets. In early 2019, our system successfully captured the world's first WebLogic RCE (CVE-2019-2725) 0-day payload, protecting thousands of cloud servers from the Muhstik botnet.

In this talk, we will delve into the technical details of how our system automatically captures 0-day attack payloads, even without prior knowledge of specific vulnerability details. We will present real-world case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and share the results of our 0-day monitoring efforts.
