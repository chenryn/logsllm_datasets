### Visibility of Old Posts
While only 19.2% of our participants reported remembering the use of the "limit past posts" tool, it is possible that they may have forgotten using it or manually restricted posts. A significant change in privacy settings, such as this, constitutes a major incident concerning retrospective privacy. Unfortunately, the "limit past posts" feature can only restrict widely shared (e.g., "public") posts to "friends only." This tool is quite limited and cannot address subtle, yet often important, retrospective privacy decisions.

### Desired Privacy Settings
Table 3 presents the results of asking participants whether they wish to change the privacy settings for five randomly selected Facebook posts. One post was excluded because the participant preferred not to answer about their desired setting. Two key observations can be made from this table:
1. While 74.5% of the existing privacy settings for 290 old posts do not require changes, 65.3% of participants wanted to change at least one post’s privacy setting. The gray-colored cells in Table 3 indicate posts where participants did not want to change their current privacy settings.
2. Preferred changes in settings are roughly split between increasing and decreasing the audience size, consistent with earlier research [6]. Interestingly, even for two posts currently shared with custom settings, participants wanted to share them with different custom settings containing smaller audiences.

The red and blue shaded regions in Table 3 indicate a decreased or increased audience, respectively. When asked why they wanted to change their privacy settings, the most common reasons were:
- The post was not appropriate (18 posts)
- It was irrelevant (16 posts)
- They did not care who could see the specific post (14 posts)

When participants wanted to increase the post's audience, they mentioned that it contained public information or a general message they wanted more individuals to see.

Regarding the importance of changing each post’s privacy setting, 65 changes were of slight or no importance, while 34 changes were of extreme or moderate importance. If participants felt that changing the privacy setting of a post was extremely important, they often attributed this to the post being inappropriate or containing private information. For instance, one participant commented, "It was a trip with my ex, I doubt my fiancée wants to see that."

### Reasons for Retrospective Changes
Participants indicated that they wish to change the privacy settings of 25.5% of their old posts. In this section, we further investigate how they came to these conclusions.

#### Retrospectively Browsing Old Facebook Posts
To gain insight into abstract concerns regarding others browsing old posts, we asked participants about their perception of, and participation in, friend-addition timestamps in the activity log. Figure 2 shows the percentage of 2018 friends who were friends in previous years for the 55 accounts at least 10 years old. We observe a substantial increase in the audience implicitly included in the most common "friends only" privacy setting. Compared to 2018, the median participant had under half as many friends in 2012 and under one-quarter as many in 2009. Figure 13 in the appendix provides an analogous graph for all 78 participants, showing an even more pronounced trend.

#### Offline Events Affecting Facebook Usage
A Facebook user’s life changes impact which privacy settings they desire [4, 6]. 56.4% of our participants mentioned that life events affected their sharing decisions. Specifically, they reported that their sharing on Facebook was influenced by personal (30 participants), professional (10), and global (18) events. Relationship changes (10) and childbirth (7) were the most frequently mentioned personal changes. Career changes (3) and issues with a coworker (3) were the most frequently mentioned professional changes. Finally, elections (6) and news about data breaches (6) were the most frequently mentioned global events motivating changes. Some of these events led to fewer personal posts on Facebook (reported by 13 of the 30 participants with personal changes and 3 of the 10 with professional changes).

#### Usage of Privacy Features
We also investigated the usage of Facebook’s own retrospective privacy features. 59% of participants reported seeing Facebook’s "privacy checkup" tool when shown a picture of it, and 44.9% reported using the privacy checkup. These high percentages are consistent with a 2018 Reuters/Ipsos survey that reported 74% of U.S. Facebook users were aware of their current Facebook privacy settings [63]. Similarly, 53.8% of our participants reported seeing the "limit past audience" feature, but only 19.2% recalled using it.

### Privacy Settings Over Time
Figure 3 shows the distribution of privacy settings for participants’ posts made each year from 2009 to 2018. The x-axis labels indicate the total number of posts made each year. The result is similar if we include shorter-lived accounts (Figure 14 in the appendix). We found that "friends" was by far the most used privacy setting, even for posts made pre-2011 when posts were public by default. This finding appears to contradict earlier work from Liu et al. [47], who found that the public setting is most heavily used on Facebook. Note that Liu et al. also used Mechanical Turk, surveying 200 users. If both our and Liu et al.’s samples are sufficiently representative, this discrepancy suggests a need for further investigation.

### Effectiveness of Existing Mechanisms
Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of Facebook’s current privacy-management mechanisms by checking for a correlation between whether a post’s existing and desired privacy settings differ and whether the corresponding participant had used an existing privacy-preserving mechanism. We used the χ2 test [60] or Fisher’s exact test [25], depending on the amount of data available for the individual test. We did not find any significant correlations between the frequency with which participants wanted to change the privacy settings on old posts and their use of various privacy-preserving mechanisms (removing a friend, changing the audience of a past post, and using the "privacy checkup" [21] or "limit past posts" [18] features).

### Visible Interaction
Figure 4 presents participants’ preferences for sharing particular posts with particular Facebook friends based on their relationship (friends or not at the time of the post) and evolution in visible Facebook interaction with that friend. The top panel presents preferences for each of our six friendship categories. The middle panel considers only interaction over the year before our user study, while the bottom panel considers interaction over the entire timeline.
