## Abstract

Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs) have been widely adopted to support a variety of business processes. As organizations embrace new working models, such as e-commerce, new challenges arise for workflow systems. These challenges include managing quality of service (QoS) effectively and developing solutions to facilitate the composition of workflow applications involving Web services. Effective QoS management is crucial for the success of organizations in e-commerce, as it helps meet customer expectations and ensures satisfaction. To achieve this, research is needed to develop mechanisms that specify, compute, monitor, and control the QoS of products or services. Additionally, the composition of workflows for e-service applications differs from traditional workflows due to the large number and heterogeneity of available Web services. Two main problems need to be addressed: efficient discovery of Web services and facilitation of their interoperability.

To enhance WfMSs with QoS management, we developed a QoS model that describes non-functional aspects of workflow components from a QoS perspective. We also created a mathematical model and implemented an algorithm (SWR algorithm) to automatically compute the overall QoS of a workflow. Our QoS model and mathematical model were validated through the deployment and execution of production workflows in genetics. The analysis of collected data confirms that our models provide a suitable framework for estimating, predicting, and analyzing the QoS of production workflows.

To support the composition of workflows involving Web services, we present a solution based on ontologies. We developed an algorithm that workflow systems and discovery mechanisms can use to find Web services with desired interfaces and operational metrics, and to assist designers in resolving heterogeneity issues among Web services. This approach significantly enhances Web service discovery and interoperability.

## Chapter 1: Introduction and Literature Review

### 1.1 Workflow Management Systems

Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs) are essential tools for organizations aiming to improve their competitive advantage, customer service, productivity, and compliance with standards. Historically, business processes were coordinated and managed by participants who inherently knew the business rules. With the introduction of workflow systems, the process became automated, and the system took responsibility for scheduling and executing tasks.

A workflow is an abstraction of a business process, consisting of logical steps (tasks), dependencies, routing rules, and participants. A task may require human involvement or be executed automatically by applications. A workflow system automates, processes, and manages workflows by coordinating the sharing and routing of information. Workflow instances run on one or more workflow engines, which interpret workflow definitions, interact with participants, and invoke external tools and applications when necessary. Automation increases process efficiency and provides opportunities for continuous improvement through the analysis of workflow instances (Cardoso, Miller et al. 2002).

### 1.2 Evolution of Workflow Management Systems

The concept of workflow management systems emerged in the 1990s, but it has roots in the office information systems (OIS) field of the 1970s. Early OIS prototypes, such as the SCOOP project and Officetalk, aimed to automate office procedures and provide a networked environment for information sharing. In the 1980s, interest in OIS declined due to failures in office automation projects, leading to a focus on flexible groupware systems. In the 1990s, there was a resurgence of interest in OIS, with new technologies like transaction processing, document image processing, and integrated office systems paving the way for workflow management technology. Despite their innovative nature, workflow management systems have not yet matured into well-proven and stable technologies (Alonso et al. 1996).

### 1.3 Motivation

This dissertation focuses on enhancing workflow systems to meet current requirements, specifically in the areas of quality of service (QoS) management and workflow composition. While modeling workflows for genetic processes, we realized the importance of anticipating and characterizing workflow behavior according to QoS. This allows organizations to better understand their processes and predict the quality of services rendered to customers.

Given the importance of continuously improving services, workflow systems with QoS support are essential. However, existing workflow systems lack comprehensive and computable QoS models. This gap between available WfMSs and the needs of organizational managers presents an interesting research problem. The first objective of this dissertation is to bridge this gap by developing tools and mechanisms for computing, estimating, and analyzing workflow QoS. The second area of research aims to develop mechanisms that facilitate and assist users during the workflow design process.

Emerging trading models, such as e-commerce, have driven the development of Web services. Organizations encapsulate their functionality as Web services, which are often integrated into workflows. The composition of workflows for e-commerce applications differs from traditional workflows due to the large number and heterogeneity of available Web services. Therefore, two key problems need to be solved: efficient discovery of Web services and facilitation of their interoperability.

### 1.4 Workflow Quality of Service

Organizations are constantly seeking innovative information systems to better fulfill their missions and strategic goals. With the advent of global-scale economies, organizations need to be more competitive, efficient, flexible, and integrated. WfMSs have been instrumental in streamlining and automating business processes, reengineering organizational structures, and reducing costs.

Researchers have identified workflows as the computing model for building Web services applications and processes that connect and exchange information over the Web (Chen, Dayal et al. 2000; German Shegalov, Michael Gillmann et al. 2001; Leymann 2001; Fensel and Bussler 2002). Advances in e-services and Web services set new requirements and challenges for workflow systems.

Our past research involved the development of fully distributed enactment services for workflow management. Our infrastructure, the METEOR system, and its OrbWork and WebWork enactment services, have been used in various domains, including bio-informatics, healthcare, telecommunications, the military, and university administration. Our experience with real-world applications has highlighted the need for QoS management in existing workflow systems.

### 1.5 Semantic Workflow Composition

Semantics are critical for the next generation of the Web. The "Semantic Web" enables the representation and processing of descriptions of every resource on the Web. A resource description, or its "semantics," includes information that can be used by computers for automatic processing in various applications.

This dissertation focuses on associating semantics with Web services and exploiting them in process composition. The composition process involves both functional and operational perspectives. The functional perspective addresses Web service discovery and semantic heterogeneity handling, while the operational perspective focuses on QoS specification for Web services and processes.

### 1.6 Major Results

- Created a mathematical model and implemented the SWR algorithm for computing the overall QoS of a workflow.
- Validated the QoS model and mathematical model through the deployment and execution of production workflows in genetics.

### 1.7 Intended Audience
