### Experimental Results with ECN

We repeated each of the above experiments using PI, REM, and ARED, but this time with packet marking and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) instead of packet drops. Up to 80% offered load, ECN had no significant effect on the response times of any of the Active Queue Management (AQM) schemes. Figures 15-20 show the results for loads of 90% and 98%.

At a 90% load, with a target queue length of 24, PI performed better with ECN. However, with a target queue length of 240, there was little change in performance. At 98% load, ECN significantly improved performance for PI at both target queue lengths. REM showed the most significant improvement in performance with ECN. Although PI outperformed REM without ECN at almost all loads, at 90% and 98% loads, PI and REM with ECN provided very similar performance. ECN had a significant effect on the performance of PI and REM in almost all cases.

In contrast, ECN had very little effect on the performance of ARED at all tested target queue lengths and loads.

### Link Utilization, Loss Ratios, and Completed Requests

Table 2 presents the link utilization, loss ratios, and the number of completed requests for each ECN experiment. PI with ECN clearly had better loss ratios, although there was little difference in link utilization and the number of requests completed. The improvement in REM's performance with ECN was due to lowered loss ratios, increased link utilization, and an increase in the number of completed requests. With ARED, there was very little improvement in link utilization or the number of completed requests, and its loss ratios were only marginally better with ECN.

### Comparisons of PI, REM, & ARED with ECN

Recall that at 80% load, no AQM scheme provided better response time performance than a simple drop-tail queue. This result was not changed by the addition of ECN. Here, we compare the best settings for PI, REM, and ARED when combined with ECN for loads of 90%, 98%, and 105%. The results for drop-tail (queue length 240) are also included as a baseline for comparison. Figures 21-23 show these results.

At 90% load, both PI and REM provided response time performance that was surprisingly close to that on an un-congested link and better than drop-tail. At 98% load, there was noticeable response time degradation with either PI or REM, but the results were far superior to those obtained with drop-tail. Both PI and REM combined with ECN had substantially lower packet loss rates than drop-tail and link utilizations that were only modestly lower.

At 105% load, the performance of PI and REM was virtually identical and only marginally worse than observed at 98% load. This is an artifact of our traffic generation model, wherein browsers generate requests less frequently as response times increase. Table 2 shows that few additional request-response exchanges were completed at 105% load compared to 98% load.

For ARED, even when used with ECN, response time performance at all load levels was significantly worse than PI and REM, except for the shortest 40% of responses where performance was comparable. Figure 24 shows the tails of the response time distribution at 98% load. For AQM with ECN, drop-tail again eventually provided better response time performance, but the crossover point occurred earlier, at approximately 5 seconds. The 1% of responses experiencing response times longer than 5 seconds received better performance under drop-tail. ARED performance again eventually approached that of drop-tail for a handful of responses.

### Discussion

Our experiments have demonstrated several interesting differences in the performance of web browsing traffic under control-theoretic and pure random-dropping AQM. Most striking is the response time performance achieved under PI and REM with ECN at loads of 90% and 98%. In particular, at 90% load, response time performance surprisingly approximated that achieved on an un-congested network. Approximately 90% of all responses completed in 500 milliseconds or less, whereas only approximately 95% of responses completed within the same threshold on the un-congested network.

Figures 15-20 illustrate the performance of PI, REM, and ARED with and without ECN at 90% and 98% loads. To better understand PIâ€™s distributions of response times and the positive impact of ECN, Figures 25-26 show scatter plots of response size versus response time for PI at 98% load. (In interpreting these plots, it is important to remember that the median response size is under 1,000 bytes and the 90th percentile response is slightly over 10,000 bytes (see Figure 3).) For small responses, strong banding effects are seen at multiples of 1 second, representing the effects of timeouts. Of special interest is the density of the band at 6 seconds, representing the effects of a dropped SYN segment. While it appears that PI forces a large number of small responses to experience multi-second response times, PI in fact does not.
