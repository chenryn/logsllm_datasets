Great work, team. I recently migrated from macOS and have found a feature there called "Spotlight Search" to be incredibly useful. Spotlight Search not only allows for the quick location of files and other items but also provides definitions for words, which I found to be a significant time-saver.

I would like to request the addition of a dictionary search feature to PowerToys Run. This would greatly enhance the functionality of the tool and make it even more valuable for users like myself who frequently need to look up word meanings. Thank you for considering this suggestion.
