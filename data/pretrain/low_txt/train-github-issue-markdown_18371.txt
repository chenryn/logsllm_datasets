When attempting to select text by dragging the mouse, I encountered an issue where the cursor remains stationary at the initial click location. This problem also affects the ability to drag and drop tabs. The issue first appeared after updating Google Chrome to version 41. To resolve it in Chrome, I added the flag `--touch-devices=123` when launching the browser, as suggested in this issue tracker: [Chromium Issue #456222](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=456222#c102).

However, I am unsure how to apply a similar fix for Atom. My setup includes a Windows 8.1 host, an Ubuntu 14.04 guest, and VirtualBox 4.3.26.
