### Demographic Differences Between Buyers and Bidders

There are clear demographic differences between buyers and bidders. Figure 11 illustrates the distribution of countries of origin for all buyers and bidders of the abuse-related jobs categorized in Table 2. (The distribution for selected workers closely follows the overall bidder distribution.) We extract the country of origin for users from their profile information. It is important to note that this information is self-reported, and there is no mechanism to prevent users from being dishonest. For instance, we have observed instances where buyers post jobs specifically to avoid bidders from India, which provides a potential motive for dishonesty. Therefore, the numbers for such countries should be considered a lower bound.

**Figure 12: Top Five Countries of Buyers Posting Abusive Jobs**

The largest group of buyers is from the United States, with other English-speaking countries, such as the UK, Canada, and Australia, also featuring prominently. Surprisingly, India also ranks high among buyers. In contrast, the largest group of bidders is from India, followed by neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh—countries known for their large, low-cost labor force, substantial Internet penetration, and widespread English fluency.

**Country of Origin Demographics by Job Category**

Figures 12 and 13 provide more detailed insights into the top five countries of buyers and bidders for each abusive job category in Table 2. For example, buyers of advertisement posting (primarily targeting Craigslist, Section 4.3.2) are predominantly from the United States. Interestingly, buyers for human CAPTCHA solvers are primarily from Bangladesh and India, indicating a demand for forming teams of solvers. Bidders from India and Bangladesh dominate white hat and social networking link building jobs, respectively. The only Western country (US) in the top five targets article generation, creating PVAs, and advertisement posting.

### Specialization

Beyond some basic requirements, such as understanding English and having access to the Internet, the abuse jobs posted on Freelancer.com generally require unskilled labor. As a result, freelancers do not necessarily need to specialize in specific job categories.

To measure specialization, we examined whether buyers and bidders participated in more than one job category. Our findings indicate that bidders do not specialize. For all but one category, fewer than 5% of the jobs that bidders bid on are within the same category; the exception is article content generation, where nearly 15% of bids per bidder are on other article jobs. Additionally, most bids are on non-abuse job categories. For bidders who bid on at least one abuse job, 70–80% of their other bids were for non-abuse jobs.

Buyers follow a similar pattern but are slightly more focused: on average, 10% of a buyer’s jobs are in the same category, while 60–70% of a buyer’s jobs are for non-abuse jobs. Article content generation is again an exception, with 30% of a buyer’s jobs requesting articles.

### Discussion

**Figure 14: How the Various Markets Fit Together in the Web Abuse Chain**

At the lowest level, workers need access to Web proxies, CAPTCHA solvers/OCR packages, and phone numbers. These components enable abusers to create Web-based email accounts, the primary building blocks for service abuse. These email accounts can be used to register accounts for various Web services, including Craigslist, Facebook, Twitter, Digg, etc.

Abusers can then implement various monetization schemes, most of which involve spamming. The most direct form of spamming uses Web email accounts to send spam. Craigslist PVAs allow abusers to post repeated, daily advertisements, making a retailer’s product consistently appear near the top of search results. Social networking accounts can be used for marketing purposes, such as creating social links (fan, friend, follower, etc.).

The relationship between this ecosystem and SEO is subtle: social networking accounts can also be used for SEO purposes. For example, abusers may spam blogs with comments linking to a Web page to obtain more backlinks. They may also submit links to social bookmarking sites or use forum accounts to create posts containing links. Many of these SEO jobs require content, either in the form of articles or actual content for blog comments or forum posts. Lastly, abusers can directly purchase backlinks on sites.

### Conclusion

This paper demonstrates how web service abuse can be augmented by the use of low-cost freelance labor. Seven years of historical data have allowed us to collect information on abuse-related work on Freelancer.com, one of the largest online websites offering piecework labor outsourcing. Potential employers offer jobs such as link building on social network sites, mass email account creation, and tasks related to search engine optimization. We found that the demand for freelancers to fill these jobs is matched by an increasing number of freelancers worldwide who compete for the work.

Freelancer.com and other freelance job platforms are prime sources of new types of service abuse. The willingness of many freelancers to participate in these schemes allows employers to quickly test and evaluate new schemes. If deemed profitable, these jobs become a staple income for willing freelancers. Services developed to ensure website security, such as CAPTCHA technology, are now targeted by employers who hire freelancers to break encoding and circumvent security measures. These trends highlight the need for robust anti-abuse defenses to protect against attackers with a versatile and inexpensive labor force.
