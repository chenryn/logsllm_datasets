### Feature Request: Clear Input Box After Search in PowerToys Run

It would be beneficial to have the option to clear the input box (search text) after selecting a result. This feature could be added to the settings menu, allowing users to enable or disable it according to their preference.

**Proposed Implementation:**
- **Option Name:** "Clear Input Box After Selection"
- **Location:** Settings > PowerToys Run
- **Default State:** Disabled (to maintain current behavior for existing users)

This enhancement would improve the user experience by providing a cleaner and more organized interface, especially for users who frequently use PowerToys Run for multiple searches.
