### Post-Liquidation Price Movement Measurement

Auction liquidators face the risk that the price of collateral may decline further during the auction, potentially resulting in a loss for the liquidator. In this section, we analyze the price movement of collateral relative to the debt currency after the settlement of a fixed spread liquidation and after the initiation of an auction liquidation. For each observed liquidation, we record the block-by-block oracle prices over a duration of 1,440 blocks, which corresponds to approximately 6 hours. We summarize the following patterns of post-liquidation price movement:

- **Horizontal**: The collateral price remains unchanged after liquidation.
- **Rise**: Within 1,440 blocks, the collateral price remains higher than the liquidation price.
- **Fall**: Within 1,440 blocks, the collateral price remains lower than the liquidation price.
- **Rise-Fall**: Within 1,440 blocks, the collateral price first rises above the liquidation price, then falls below it.
- **Fall-Rise**: Within 1,440 blocks, the collateral price first falls below the liquidation price, then rises above it.
- **Rise-Fluctuation**: Within 1,440 blocks, the collateral price first rises above, then falls below the liquidation price, and repeats this movement more than twice.
- **Fall-Fluctuation**: Within 1,440 blocks, the collateral price first falls below, then rises above the liquidation price, and repeats this movement more than twice.

We observe that the collateral price remains below the liquidation price by the end of the observation window in only 19.07% of the 28,138 observed liquidations. If these liquidations had been conducted through an auction, the liquidator might have incurred a loss.

### Monthly DAI/ETH Liquidations

In Table 8, we present the number of monthly liquidations repaid in DAI and collateralized in ETH on Aave V1, Aave V2, Compound, dYdX, and MakerDAO.

### Empirical Study of DeFi Liquidations

IMC '21, November 2–4, 2021, Virtual Event, USA

Following Equations 13, 14, and 15, we derive Equation 16:
\[ \frac{C}{D} \cdot (1 + LS) < 1 \]

If a borrowing position is over-collateralized (cf. Equation 13) but still liquidatable, and if we configure \( LT \) and \( LS \) such that \( LT \cdot (1 + LS) \geq 1 \), this configuration conflicts with Equation 16. From Equation 16, we obtain Equation 17:
\[ \frac{C \cdot LT}{D} \cdot (1 + LS) < 1 \]

Equation 17 indicates that \( \frac{C \cdot LT}{D} > 1 \) is a prerequisite for a fixed spread liquidation to increase the health factor of an over-collateralized, liquidatable borrowing position.
