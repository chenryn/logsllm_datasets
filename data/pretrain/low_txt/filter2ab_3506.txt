**ATT&CK ID:** T0815  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Denial of View

Adversaries may employ a denial of view tactic to disrupt and prevent operator oversight of an Industrial Control System (ICS) environment. This technique can manifest as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source. The user interface will typically recover and become available once the interference ceases. 

This disruption can hinder the ability of operators to monitor and manage the ICS, potentially leading to operational inefficiencies or more severe consequences.
