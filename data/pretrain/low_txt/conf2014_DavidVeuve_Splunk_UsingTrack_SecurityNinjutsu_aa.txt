### Agenda
- **Visibility – Analysis – Action in Four Scenarios**
  1. Threat List Integration leads to Firewall Blocks
  2. Anomaly Detection leads to Opening a Ticket
  3. Behavioral Profiling leads to Manager Confirmation
  4. Visual Correlation of Security Indicators

### Content Overview
1. Tools, Searches, and Demos
2. All examples and concepts come from actual customer requirements and deployments. No smoke and mirrors.
3. GitHub with data generators and accoutrements at the end of the presentation

### Audience
1. Security Engineers, SOC Analysts, Threat Analysts, or Technical Professionals who care about security
2. Splunk skill level: Basic to Advanced
3. No Enterprise Security required (though it can make things easier at scale)

### Visibility – Analysis – Action
- **Framework for evaluating data and responding with Splunk**
- **Applies to all existing frameworks, as it’s the Splunk side of the loop.**
- **Example: Lateral Movement Section of the Kill Chain**
  - **Visibility**: What data will let you detect Lateral Movement?
  - **Analysis**: What will you do with that data to reach a decision?
  - **Action**: What will you do in response to that decision?
  - **Automation**: Can we automate all of this?

### Scenario One: C&C Detection and Blocking
- **New threat list intelligence (or any other source of detecting attackers) has become available, and we are trying to block any outbound Command and Control.**
- **Formal firewall policy can only be pushed every Wednesday night and Sunday night – not fast enough.**
- **Goal**: Take in the firewall logs, leverage available intelligence to detect C&C behavior, and then block the destinations, all in near real-time.
- **Visibility**: Firewall Logs, Threat Intelligence Sources
- **Analysis**: Intersection (lookup) of the two
- **Action**: Apply dynamic firewall blocks

### Threat Intelligence
- **Definition**: A feed of known bad IPs, DNS names, MD5s, URLs, etc., from vendors or non-profits specializing in discovering Indicators of Compromise.
- **Great sources of Open Source Threat Intel**:
  - Emerging Threats: [Link](http://rules.emergingthreats.net/)
  - I-Blocklist: [Link](https://www.iblocklist.com/lists.php)
  - MalwareDomains: [Link](http://www.malwaredomains.com/)
  - Zeus Tracker: [Link](https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/)
- **Commercial Entities** (generally better ranking/quality):
  - Norse (Splunk Partner), iSight Partners, Verizon iDefense, Commercial Versions of most of the above, and many more

### Visibility: Connection End Date
- **Palo Alto Networks Firewall Log**
  - Src and Dest IPs
  - Firewall Rule
  - Example: `Sep 15 19:02:06, 2014/09/15 19:02:05, 10.2.2.14, 206.16.215.101, 206.16.216.158, 214.34.245.101, Internet Traffic, salesforce-base, vsys1, Trust, Untrust, ethernet1/8, ethernet1/2, MyLogForwarding, 2014/09/15 19:02:05, 24238, 1, 61845, 443, 57339, 443, 0x400000, tcp, allow, 1275, 761, 514, 14, 2014/09/15 19:01:31, 5, any, 0, 358477769, 0x0, 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255, United States, 0, 8, 6`

### Threat Intelligence Lookup
- **Threat Intel Lookup**:
  - `bad_ip, threat_intel_source`
  - `115.29.46.99/32, zeus_c2s`
  - `61.155.30.0/24, cymru_hgp`

### Analysis
- **Search Query**:
  ```spl
  index=pan_logs sourcetype=pan_traffic src="10.*" dest!="10.*"
  | lookup ThreatIntel dest
  | search ThreatList=*
  ```
- **Data held in Lookup Table**:
  - Name of our lookup, and the key field
- **Steps**:
  1. Pull out all firewall traffic coming from inside our network, going outside our network.
  2. Cross-reference that data with our Threat Intel list using a lookup.
  3. Pull just the logs that have Threat Intel.

### Analysis - Challenges
- **Performance**:
  - You get lots of traffic, maybe lots of threat intel entries.
  - **Solution**: Enterprise Security is built to solve this problem at scale.
  - **Alternate Solution**: Data models help substantially with the first half. You can fragment the lookups if you get to very high numbers.
- **Multiple Threat Lists**:
  - Deprioritize open-source threat lists vs. premium threat lists.
  - **Solution**: Enterprise Security
