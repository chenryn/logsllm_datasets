**Title: Message from the DCCS Program Chair**

Welcome to DCCS 2013. This is an exciting time to be working on dependability. Our daily lives have become increasingly reliant on complex, networked computer systems. Ensuring the resilience of these systems against malicious attacks, accidental faults, design errors, and unexpected operating conditions is both more critical and more challenging than ever. If these systems are unreliable, insecure, or untrustworthy, they can cause significant harm, and users will abandon them, thereby squandering opportunities for progress.

The Dependable Computing and Communications Symposium (DCCS) brings together academic and industrial researchers in all aspects of dependability and security. We present the best work on creating, validating, deploying, and maintaining dependable and secure systems. Our coverage spans the entire stack, from VLSI and CPU architecture at the bottom, through operating systems, networks, application software, and human factors. With this comprehensive focus on dependability and security, the technical program of DCCS '13 offers a cutting-edge view of the state of the art and practice in this key and rapidly expanding area of computing.

I would like to extend my gratitude to all the researchers and practitioners who submitted papers, whether their work was accepted or not, for making DCCS '13 a great conference. The program includes 21 papers, reflecting a highly selective acceptance rate of 19.6%. The program was selected by an outstanding committee that worked diligently, conducting 469 reviews, engaging in several days of online deliberations, and participating in a full-day in-person meeting. Committee members traveled from around the world to attend, and their dedication to providing service deserves the community's sincere thanks and appreciation.

The review process was rigorous and double-blind, with none of the committee members knowing the authors' names or affiliations. Each submitted paper received at least three reviews from committee members. Papers selected for a second round of reviews received multiple additional evaluations. All authors had the opportunity to submit comments, which were reviewed by committee members for every paper, including those that did not advance to the second round. During the committee meeting, every paper with at least one member supporting acceptance was discussed in depth. Potential conflicts of interest were carefully managed, with conflicted members excluded from discussions. I would like to personally thank Prof. Saurabh Bagchi for coordinating the review process for papers where I had a potential conflict of interest, ensuring that even the program chair adhered to the double-blind process.

I deeply appreciate the efforts of the General Chair, Andr√°s Pataricza, and his team, as well as the support from the steering committee led by Neeraj Suri and Rick Schlichting. I also want to thank DCCS's most recent program chairs, Saurabh Bagchi and Philip Koopman, for their tremendous help. Finally, I am grateful to my graduate students for their logistical support, including the development of new software for running the program committee meeting, which made the paper selection process much more efficient and smooth.

I hope you enjoy the program!
