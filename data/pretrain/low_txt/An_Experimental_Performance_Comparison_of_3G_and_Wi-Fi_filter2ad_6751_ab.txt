### Optimized Text

When a client is in motion, it is often not optimal to always select the Access Point (AP) with the strongest signal. As the client approaches a potential AP, it would be more beneficial to choose an AP that is just coming into range. This strategy maximizes the usable connection duration. Our findings indicate that while many connection attempts are successful, the data transfer often fails to initiate due to the connection being severed. This does not imply that opportunistic contacts cannot occur at high speeds; rather, it underscores the need for faster AP association and setup techniques, such as QuickWiFi [4], and improved AP selection algorithms for mobile clients. These enhancements would better facilitate opportunistic transactions during in-motion scenarios.

Figure 2 illustrates the total amount of data transferred for each access technology. The 3G connection remains active throughout the experiment, showing a linear increase in the total bytes received. Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is represented by a step function, highlighting how each connection opportunity contributes to the overall data received. Each point on the "Wi-Fi total" line represents a successful contact with an AP. Despite the variability in Wi-Fi contacts due to their intermittent nature, a significant amount of data is still transferred, thanks to the higher data rates of the technology. This is particularly evident in walking experiments, where slower speeds and closer proximity to APs allow for longer connection durations.

Figure 3 presents throughput results for a single, representative experiment comparing 3G and Wi-Fi at walking speeds. The walking experiments last approximately 3385 seconds, during which 3G transfers around 285 MB of data. Wi-Fi, however, is only connected for 1353 seconds and downloads 210 MB. Each Wi-Fi contact takes advantage of short, high-throughput opportunities, transferring substantial amounts of data.

### 3.2 3G vs. Wi-Fi Uploads

Figure 4 shows the instantaneous throughput of 3G and Wi-Fi uploads at walking speeds. The behavior is similar to that of the downloads, but this time, the total data transferred via Wi-Fi exceeds that of 3G by 2.6 times. This discrepancy is attributed to the poor upload performance of 3G on the mobile device.

### An Experimental Performance Comparison of 3G and Wi-Fi

The instantaneous 3G traffic pattern exhibits transitions between idle states and periods of data transfer, resulting in much lower throughput than the downloads (averaging at 130 kbits/s). To understand this, we conducted additional experiments using a stationary laptop (Lenovo T500 with an iPhone SIM card) and an iPhone with updated software and baseband firmware, 3.0 (7A341) and 04.26.08, respectively. The new traces show more consistent, albeit lower, throughput throughout the entire upload duration. The total amount of data transferred remained unchanged. We conjecture that these improvements are due to enhancements in the iPhone's baseband software, which allow for more efficient data buffering and eliminate the burstiness of the outgoing traffic. Further upload experiments with the laptop showed it could transfer data at twice the rate of the iPhone, suggesting hardware limitations or artificial software limitations on the iPhone.

One side observation from our experiments is that residential Internet service rates are higher than previously reported [7]. Upon further investigation, we found that Verizon FIOS has recently become available in the area, and some homes have upgraded to this higher level of service. This is promising for opportunistic communications, as more data can be transferred during brief contact opportunities. It is also important to note that during these experiments, the full potential of the Wi-Fi AP was not realized and was limited by the back-haul link. Although the cost of higher throughput links is decreasing, affordable service provider rates are still below the available wireless rates of 802.11, placing the bottleneck at the back-haul link to the Internet.

### 4 Related Work

This study compares two dominant access technologies, 3G and Wi-Fi, in real-world, in-motion scenarios. While there have been numerous studies on the performance of 3G and Wi-Fi networks, this is the first to provide a side-by-side comparison during motion. This work highlights the potential of Wi-Fi as a viable option for high-throughput, in-motion communication.

Previous research on communicating with stationary APs has been conducted in various environments, including high-speed Autobahns [14], the Californian desert [5], and infrequently traveled roads in Canada [6]. These studies demonstrated that significant data can be transferred while moving, using APs along the road.

The authors of [3] extended this idea to urban environments, reporting on 290 drive-hours and finding a median connection duration of 13 seconds. This finding is promising for in-motion communications, potentially allowing large amounts of data to be transferred over under-utilized links without the need for expensive 3G connections.

Studies on HSDPA and CDMA 1x EV-DO networks have shown similar variability [10, 12, 8]. Our experiments on a HSDPA network also exhibit this behavior.

### 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we compare two popular wireless access technologies: 3G and Wi-Fi. 3G provides continuous connectivity with low data rates and high costs, while Wi-Fi offers intermittent, high-burst data transfers and is often free when open. We experimentally demonstrate that, with default AP selection techniques, off-the-shelf equipment, and no external antennae, we can opportunistically connect to open or community Wi-Fi APs in an urban area and transfer significant amounts of data at walking and driving speeds. Intermittent Wi-Fi connectivity in an urban area can achieve equivalent or greater throughput than an "always-connected" 3G network.

To enhance Wi-Fi performance, several modifications can be made:
1. Reduce connection setup time with APs, especially for community networks like FON, which have lengthy authentication processes.
2. Clients can use Wi-Fi maps and real-time location updates to select the most beneficial APs for in-motion users [13].
3. Caching data on the AP (for both upload and download) can eliminate the Internet back-haul link bottleneck.

We are currently testing an improved in-motion Wi-Fi architecture that demonstrates significantly higher transfer rates than 3G at all speeds.
