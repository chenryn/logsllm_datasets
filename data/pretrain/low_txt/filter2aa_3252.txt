- **Checkbook Shutter Control:**
  - "I could certainly foresee circumstances in which we would not want imagery to be openly disseminated of a sensitive site of any type, whether it is here or overseas." - Robert Muttett, Director, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
  - With about $1 billion from Murrett's agency, companies like DigitalGlobe and GeoEye plan to launch new satellites with higher resolutions.
  - While the public will see crisper images online, government regulations will require the companies to degrade the quality to a half-meter resolution. [Source](http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7404181.html)

## Imagery Analysis
- **Key Aspects:**
  - Understand capabilities and limitations of sensors and platforms.
