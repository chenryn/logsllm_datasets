### BlackHat US-21 Keynote: Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas

On February 2, 2021, Alejandro Mayorkas was sworn in as the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) by President Joe Biden. As the first Latino and immigrant to hold this position, Mayorkas brings a distinguished 30-year career in law enforcement and legal practice to his role.

Prior to his current appointment, Mayorkas served as the Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from 2013 to 2016 and as the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2009 to 2013. During his tenure at DHS, he spearheaded several significant initiatives, including the development and implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. He also negotiated cybersecurity and homeland security agreements with foreign governments, led the department's response to the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, and helped establish and manage the Blue Campaign, an initiative aimed at combating human trafficking. Additionally, he developed an emergency relief program for orphaned youth following the devastating earthquake in Haiti in January 2010. Under his leadership, the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate was created to enhance the integrity of the legal immigration system.

Mayorkas began his government service in the Department of Justice, where he served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Central District of California, specializing in the prosecution of white-collar crimes. After nearly nine years as a federal prosecutor, he became the youngest U.S. Attorney in the nation, overseeing high-profile prosecutions involving financial fraud, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, public corruption, violent crime, cybercrime, environmental crime, international money laundering, and securities fraud.

Mayorkas holds a bachelorâ€™s degree with distinction from the University of California, Berkeley, and a law degree from Loyola Law School.
