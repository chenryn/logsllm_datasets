**Abstract:**
The Internet has the potential to enable new forms of service innovation and trading, as well as the analysis of resulting value networks with unprecedented scale and dynamics. However, most related economic activities remain largely brittle and manual. Service-oriented business implementations focus on operational aspects at the expense of value creation aspects such as quality and regulatory compliance. These implementations enforce a prefixed, non-adaptive manner of conducting business rather than capturing the semantics of a business domain in a way that would allow service systems to adapt to changing value propositions. In this paper, we set requirements for SDL-compliant business service semantics and propose a method for their ontological representation and governance. We demonstrate an implementation of our approach in the context of service-oriented Information Governance.

**1. Introduction**
Given the intangible nature of services, it is commonly believed that the Internet would enable new ways of creating, bundling, and trading services, as well as analyzing the resulting value networks on a global scale with unprecedented efficiency and dynamics. However, most economic activities related to online service trading remain largely brittle and manual. Despite the initial assumption that software-based services (as in service-oriented architecture, SOA) would be a core enabling technology supporting a highly efficient service-based economy, significant adoption of this technology on the Internet as a means to support service trading has yet to be witnessed. From a computational perspective, a large number of enterprise systems rely on functional components encapsulated as Web services to support their activities or interact with third parties for data and functionality exchange and reuse. 

Electronic business implementations enforce a prefixed, non-adaptive manner of conducting business rather than providing an explicit understanding of the business (service) domain. This lack of understanding limits the ability of service systems to adapt to changing value propositions. Service-orientation is a promising paradigm for decomposing inward-oriented organizational processes into outward-oriented business service components. However, SOA does not constitute business service components; it focuses on functional decomposition, which is distinct from business service decomposition. The underlying conception of a service is limited to request and response elements of software artifacts, which are disjoint from value creation aspects such as strategy, proposition, roles, resourcing, pricing, quality, and regulatory compliance.

This lack of ontological analysis of service as a first-class concept is also evident in business modeling. Only recently has a commonly agreed service conception emerged from the service-dominant marketing paradigm. SDL promotes a shift from goods to services as the primary unit of economic exchange, leading to the design of SDL-compliant upper-level models that can play an important role in automated business service (de)composition.

In this paper, after an overview of service perspectives in Section 2, we set ontological (Section 3) and governance (Section 4) requirements for SDL-compliant business service semantics. Domain ontologies for the purpose of service automation must convey these business semantics to account for the quality and compliance of functionality and data exchanged across the network. Effective governance of these ontologies is essential, ensuring they are managed by an optimal configuration of roles among peers in the networked enterprise. The adoption of an upper-ontology can also guarantee that the services developed follow an SDL paradigm. In Section 5, we set the background for our approach. In Section 6, we propose a method for the ontological representation and governance of business service semantics, and an implementation in the context of service-oriented Information Governance using Collibra’s Business Semantics Glossary. We conclude with a discussion and future work in Section 7.

**2. Service Science, Engineering, and Business Modeling**
Maglio et al. [17] define Service Science as "the study of the application of resources controlled by one system for the benefit of another system in the context of an economic exchange." This study aligns with the shift in marketing from goods-dominant to service-dominant logic (SDL) [32], where service becomes the new unit of economic exchange. In SDL, a service is conceived as a (value-providing or -integrating) action, contrasting with goods-dominant logic, where a service is considered an object [11]. This paradigm shift was necessary to understand and develop new ways of value creation in networked enterprises [22].

We distinguish at least two areas of service study important for our purpose:
1. **The Business Perspective:** Adopts SDL to understand why enterprises should innovate and trade services by considering value creation aspects. Most modeling approaches take the perspective of a single company, assuming a closed world and making their business service semantics tacit and useless outside the organization. These approaches classify a service as a static resource (endurant) rather than an occurrence of actions (perdurant). Only recently have SDL-compliant service meta-models been proposed that may lead to sound ontological foundations.
2. **The IT Perspective:** Adopts service-oriented modeling for functional decomposition and engineering of distributed systems. Prominent service description meta-models (e.g., WSMO and WSDL) conceive service as a static function, failing to convey any value creation aspect. Web service engineering aims at interoperability of communication protocols (e.g., SOAP, REST) and data formats between heterogeneous “service parks” [9, 31]. Process languages (BPMN, BPEL, etc.) are adopted for choreography, control flows, events, and temporal dependencies to define valid sequences of service invocations. Business decision logic may be embedded within complex control flow logic, often hidden within expert components or deferred to manual decision steps.

In the networked Internet era, the ability to reactively and automatically engage in service value chains is a key competitive advantage. This requires the ability to automate business decision-making such that computers do not only follow a brittle, prefixed operational procedure but have embedded business semantics that enable them to adapt operational activities to maximize business performance. The governance of business semantics and its embedding in ontologies that support value creation aspects of service networks entails many requirements. We focus on quality and compliance aspects of value interactions, resulting in ontological requirements (ORs) (Section 3) and governance requirements (GRs) (Section 4).

**3. Ontological Requirements**
To overcome the issue of semantic alignment, peers usually create an ontology represented using a knowledge representation grammar (textually using SBVR or OWL, or visually using UML). The more aligned the ontology with the peer’s individual perspectives, the easier it becomes to synchronize between business expectations and Web service solutions [5]. OWL-S (in 2004) and WSMO (in 2005) were early attempts to standardize operational semantics for a service, but these ontologies do not capture the business semantics necessary to evaluate quality and compliance aspects of constituting (action and content) commitments [18, 24, 11]. Therefore, our requirements constrain the foundation (OR1-2) and representation (OR3-4) of viable ontologies.

Computational ontologies for our purpose must convey domain-specific business service semantics in terms of upper-level categories and relations describing the nature and structure of service-dominant logic. Semantic alignment concerns requirements at the upper-level and domain-level, with two types of validity.

**Ontological Requirement 1:**
An SDL-compliant upper-level ontology accounts for an externally valid alignment of service conceptions such as action, service system, resource, and service.

By requiring external validity, we need an upper-level ontology to serve either as a foundation for developing domain ontologies or as a common ground for aligning heterogeneous domain ontologies. The latter requires domain ontologies to specialize upper-level concepts from SDL for a specific domain of value creation.

**Ontological Requirement 2:**
A domain-dependent specialization of an SDL-valid upper ontology accounts for a descriptively valid alignment of business service semantics about value creation aspects in a specific domain.

By requiring descriptive validity, we need the domain terminology and rules to be a substantial description of the business service domain as perceived and agreed by a community [1].

The intention of such a domain-dependent specialization is to provide a service description, i.e., a description of value-creation aspects, actions on these aspects, and peer roles entitled to realize these actions in a compliant way. Our conception aligns closely with the one proposed by Ferrario and Guarino [11], who state that service commitment needs to be distinguished from service content (the kind of actions the trustee commits to) and service process (how the service commitment is implemented). A trustee makes a service commitment to produce a certain content, i.e., a set of actions. It is a temporal static event, a speech act documented in a contract among peers [11]. This corresponds largely to the business service semantics. Service content, while defining the types of actions and roles, is close to the operational semantics, which corresponds to the service process. For a service description to make sense for both business and ICT, service commitment speech acts (hence business service semantics) must be aligned with the service process (hence operational semantics) through domain-dependent specializations that define service content. This allows us to possibly abandon the use of prefixed process-based languages and embrace instead declarative rules that capture what value aspects restrict our decision-making, rather than how to honor these restrictions.

The Unified Service Description Language (USDL), and especially Linked-USDL, is a good example of such domain-specialization. The latter uses semantic Web principles to construct an ontology to describe services by establishing explicit links to other existing ontologies emerging from Linked Data initiatives. While the model was initially constructed to describe services, our study [3] revealed that it could also be used to model internal parts of service systems and service networks by adding rich, multi-level relationships.

Representing this alignment between service commitment and content/process implies two additional requirements for the ontology representation grammar.

**Ontological Requirement 3:**
The ontology representation grammar must account for tracking of circumstances (e.g., state, event, process) that determine the relevance of value creation aspects across the service lifecycle.

Real-world entities, like services, are dynamic by nature [11]. Their possession of properties is not always persistent throughout their lifecycle and may change based on different types of circumstances.
