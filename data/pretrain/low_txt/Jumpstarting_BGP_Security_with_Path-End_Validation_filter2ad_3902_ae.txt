### Route Filtering and AS-Path Validation

To filter routes, we first block invalid routes and then allow all others. This can be achieved using the following configuration:

```plaintext
ip as-path access-list allow-all permit
route-map Path-End-Validation permit 1
match ip as-path as1
match ip as-path allow-all
```

### Related Work

The security vulnerabilities in today's interdomain routing system have motivated numerous proposals to secure BGP routing. Due to space constraints, we will focus on the main proposals for preventing path manipulation attacks. For a comprehensive discussion, including attack detection methods (e.g., [25, 31, 46]), we refer the reader to the survey in [13].

Previous research has analyzed various aspects of securing interdomain routing against path manipulations, including security guarantees [10, 23] and adoptability [14, 18]. Several proposals, such as S-BGP [27], psBGP [44], and BGPsec [34], use cryptography to prevent route manipulation. These proposals require modifications to the BGP protocol and the deployment of routers capable of performing online cryptographic computations, which pose significant challenges to adoption.

In contrast, path-end validation extends RPKI's offline approach and can be deployed on top of the current Internet infrastructure with only router configuration changes and offline, off-router cryptography. Secure-origin BGP (soBGP [45]) was another proposal that used offline validation of inter-AS connections. It was proposed to the IETF as a general framework allowing for various realizations, from essentially RPKI to variants requiring significant changes to routers and BGP message formats. However, it was abandoned in favor of S-BGP and BGPsec, and its properties were not sufficiently analyzed.

Path-end validation is designed to be easily deployable and to provide significant security benefits even in limited partial deployment. We consider path-end validation as a specific realization of soBGP, guided by two key insights: (1) validating the 1-AS-hop suffix of the BGP path is highly beneficial, and (2) utilizing RPKI's offline approach provides significant adoption benefits, such as avoiding the need to change BGP message formats or decision processes at routers, and eliminating the need to trust intermediate ASes to forward security-related information. Our simulation results show that path-end validation offers a very attractive "return on investment" in partial adoption.

Following the publication of our results on path-end validation in [15], a talk at NANOG [38] and several blog posts [39, 40] presented a related effort by LinkedIn and several vendors and providers to rethink path validation. We believe that path-end validation is a promising direction to explore in this context, and our results can inform such efforts.

RLP, a recent proposal from the SIDR working group [42], suggests mitigating route-leaks by annotating hops in BGP advertisements with provider-to-customer and peering links. This allows routers to detect "valley" routes, i.e., BGP path advertisements that violate the Gao-Rexford export condition [17]. While RLP can protect against all route-leak attacks, our solution, described in Section 6, protects only the stubs (over 85% of ASes). However, our mechanism follows the design guidelines in Section 2 to simplify deployment, whereas the RLP proposal requires modifications to routers and changes to the BGP message format, which can limit its value under partial adoption.

Interestingly, [14] examines path-end validation (termed "first-hop authentication" therein) from an economic/game-theoretic perspective. In contrast, our focus is on the deployability of path-end validation (e.g., avoiding the need to upgrade/replace BGP routers) and quantifying its security benefits in partial adoption. While [14] mentions online cryptography as a viable approach, this would eliminate the deployability and security benefits discussed here.

Our preliminary workshop paper [15] studied the security guarantees of path-end validation but did not address (1) the prerequisites to deployment discussed in Section 3, namely stability and security monotonicity, (2) path-end validation's security benefits when RPKI is only partially deployed, as discussed in Section 5, and (3) path-manipulation attacks beyond next-AS attacks, as discussed in Section 6.

### Conclusion

We presented path-end validation as a means to improve interdomain routing security while avoiding the hurdles of BGPsec deployment. Our security evaluation shows that path-end validation provides a high level of security even with a modest number of adopters, and an open-source implementation demonstrates its feasibility on today's routing infrastructure.

We believe that path-end validation provides a tangible path to significant improvements in interdomain routing security during the interim period before BGPsec is fully deployed. Our findings motivate the standardization of path-end validation and its integration into RPKI. We propose that governments and industry groups concentrate regulatory efforts and/or financial incentives on convincing large ISPs in their countries to adopt path-end validation (on top of RPKI).

Importantly, the success of path-end validation, as an extension of RPKI, depends on the extent to which RPKI is adopted, especially by large ISPs. While RPKI is slowly gaining traction, its deployment rate remains slow, with only about 6% of IP prefixes advertised in BGP protected by RPKI. Therefore, analyzing the root causes of RPKI's sluggish adoption and eliminating obstacles is an important direction for future research and standardization efforts.
