### Performance Evaluation

We consider the performance of the system by employing heuristic measures and a comprehensive model that accounts for various factors. Specifically, we evaluate the combined performance (PI, P2, and P3) of a MIMO detector under different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions. For instance, at SNR = 12 dB, PRISM discards states with a probability less than \(10^{-15}\), which is typical for MIMO Maximum Likelihood (ML) detectors.

In the 1x4 MIMO detector, we discard states that are reached with a very low probability. To check for convergence, we use a Viterbi decoder with traceback length \(L = 8\) at SNR = 8 dB. Compared to the original model, the reduced Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) has only about 61,000 states, significantly reducing the number of states by several orders of magnitude. We can construct and verify the DTMC and check for Convergence Index (CI) within 120 seconds. The CI decreases with increasing traceback length and stabilizes past \(L = 5\).

### Convergence Analysis

To check for non-convergence in the trellis stage patterns, we introduce a new variable `count` in each state. The variables `prevO` and `prevI` correspond to the previous traceback stages. If a trellis stage is non-converging, we increment the `count` by 1. For a convergent stage, we reset the `count` to 0. When `count` exceeds \(L\) in a state, we set a flag to 1, indicating that the previous \(L\) trellis paths do not converge. This flag is used to define the DTMC reward model.

To determine the average case convergence property (P2), we define the probability that a bit decoded in any time step has non-converging traceback paths. We write CI as \(R = ? [I = T]\). In steady state, the CI computes the probability of non-convergence. The reduction of the system's state space is achieved by retaining only the necessary variables (`pmO`, `pml`, and `prevIa`) and discarding the others. This reduction preserves the probabilistic behavior of the system.

### Experimental Results

Our experiments were conducted on a 3 GHz, 3.25 GB machine. We assume that all DTMC state variables are initialized to 0 at the start of operation. For an SNR of 5 dB, we check the error properties of the Viterbi model over \(T = 300\) time steps (Table 1). The first fixpoint is referred to as Reachability (RI). After this fixpoint, no new states are reached, and further iterations do not change the values significantly. For the 1x4 MIMO detector, the exact values of P2 and CI are computed using the steady-state solver in PRISM.

Tables 3, 4, and 5 show the computation times for the steady-state solver compared to the model checking approach. Our time-bounded model checking is faster, completing in less than 0.5 seconds, while the steady-state solver takes 53.27 seconds. The results from our approach closely match those obtained through extensive simulations, particularly for very low Bit Error Rates (BER).

### Error Characterization

We characterize bit errors by analyzing the conditional probability distribution of the received quantized samples given the corresponding decoded bits. In the absence of internal data corruption, a correct quantization level will always result in a correct decoded bit. Therefore, if the conditional probability fails, it implies internal data corruption. For larger systems, we plan to incorporate compositional schemes for error detection and diagnosis.

### Conclusion

We have introduced a formal methodology to guarantee the statistical performance of communication systems, particularly MIMO RTL designs. Future work includes incorporating compositional schemes for error detection and diagnosis in MIMO systems. For larger systems, we aim to explore generic approaches applicable to this class of systems.
