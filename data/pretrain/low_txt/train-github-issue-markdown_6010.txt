Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) is a crucial feature in 3D modeling, and many frameworks, such as Babylon.js, offer built-in support for it. However, in the case of three.js, the only available CSG solution is an outdated plugin (https://github.com/chandlerprall/ThreeCSG), which has not been updated in seven years.

I propose that this plugin be modernized to support `BufferGeometry` and integrated into the three.js codebase as an official CSG plugin. I am willing to contribute financially to make this happen.
