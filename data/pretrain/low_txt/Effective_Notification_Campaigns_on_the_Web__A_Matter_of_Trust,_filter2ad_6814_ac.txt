### 2019 Notification and Reminder Process

#### Initial Notifications
Letters were dispatched on the Friday of the previous week to ensure they arrived in the same week as the emails, which were spread over five days to avoid triggering rate-based spam filters. In total, 48 out of 1337 emails (3.5%) and 153 out of 2660 letters (5.8%) could not be delivered and were returned to the sender. The number for emails is a lower bound, as many spam filters discard messages silently.

#### Survival Analysis
To avoid skewed data due to the staggered sending of notifications, survival times were calculated from the expected receipt date: the day of sending for emails and July 1st for letters. The given survival rates and significance values are computed for the last day before the reminders were sent (26–35 days after the initial notifications). The results of the significance tests, corrected for multiple comparisons using Holm-Bonferroni [24], are shown in Appendix A1 and are considered significant at \( p \leq 0.05 \).

In our survival analysis, all notification groups showed an improvement over the CONTROL group. Figure 2a illustrates the survival rates (lower is better) for different factors, with confidence intervals provided by Kaplan-Meier. For the contact medium, LETTER had the lowest survival rate (55.6 ± 1.9%), significantly lower than EMAIL (66.3 ± 2.6%, \( p < 0.0001 \)). Among the different senders, the UNI-LAW group led to the most remediations, achieving a survival rate of 55.0 ± 2.8%. The CITIZEN group followed with 59.9 ± 2.7%, and the UNI-CS group with 61.4 ± 2.7%. Only the difference between UNI-CS and UNI-LAW was statistically significant (\( p < 0.05 \)).

For the different framings, GDPR+FINE had the lowest survival rate (50.1 ± 2.8%), compared to 56.6 ± 2.8% for GDPR and 69.6 ± 2.6% for PRIVACY (all differences were statistically significant).

Comparing the overall highest and lowest survivals across all 18 groups, the worst-performing group (UNI-CS – EMAIL – PRIVACY) had a five-week survival rate of 82.0 ± 7.5%, while the best group (UNI-LAW – LETTER – GDPR+FINE) significantly reduced it to 39.4 ± 5.6% (see Table 4 in the Appendix). This indicates that more than 60% of owners remediated the misconfiguration, showing that the considered factors can make a significant difference. Even the worst-performing notification group was an improvement over no notification, which showed a survival rate of 93 ± 2.4% in the same timeframe. In all cases, the survival curves dropped sharply at the beginning, with most websites being remediated within 7–10 days.

#### Websites Going Offline
Some owners took their websites offline instead of remediating the GA installation. In total, 59 non-CONTROL websites (1.4%) were offline at the end of the five-week period. Some owners informed us that the websites were outdated and no longer needed. In the same timeframe, six websites (1%) in the CONTROL group went offline.

#### Reminders
We sent a reminder to all owners who received our initial message but had not become compliant by July 25, 2019. Owners who had contacted us for updates or questions received a personalized reminder if appropriate. Email reminders were sent on August 1st and 2nd, while letters were sent on August 6th. Despite not attempting to contact owners where the initial delivery failed, five out of 809 reminder emails (0.6%) and 27 out of 1351 reminder letters (2%) were returned as undeliverable.

Due to human error, we sent the GDPR+FINE framing to all three LETTER – UNI-LAW groups, contaminating the results. However, we present a brief evaluation of this mistake's effects.

For the post-reminder survival analysis, we only considered owners who received a reminder, excluding those who had already made their site compliant or where the initial message could not be delivered. For CONTROL, we included sites that were still non-compliant as of August 2, 2019. Figure 2b shows the post-reminder survival for the different groups, considering only EMAIL and CONTROL due to the unknown influence of the incorrect reminders. It cannot be directly compared with Figure 2a. Results for all groups are shown in Table 4 in the Appendix.

The UNI-LAW – LETTER – GDPR+FINE group achieved a survival rate of 54.7 ± 10% after 24 days. The group with the highest survival was also a UNI-LAW group (UNI-LAW – EMAIL – PRIVACY), achieving 88.1 ± 9.1% survival, which is still an improvement over CONTROL (97.6 ± 1.7%). The overall trends remained similar to the initial message, though with smaller differences between the groups.

#### Accidental Experiment: Increasing the Pressure
The erroneously sent reminders provided an opportunity to study the effects of starting with a regular notification and then increasing the pressure with a later letter that explicitly mentions potential fines. As this experiment was unplanned, we do not have a control group for comparison and can only describe the observed values without a baseline. However, we can compare it with data from the initial notification. Table 1 shows the results from the UNI-LAW – LETTER group.

Surprisingly, the survival rate for GDPR was 13.8 percentage points higher than for GDPR+FINE, with PRIVACY showing an even higher survival rate. This seems counterintuitive, as one might expect the groups that had previously received a less severe message to be "shocked into action" and thus have at least as many remediations as the GDPR+FINE group. We have no definitive explanation for this behavior. However, some recipients may have recognized the letterhead, remembered the old message, and acted accordingly.

After the reminder, 31 additional websites (including two in CONTROL) were offline.

### CheckGA Usage
We evaluated our web-based tool, CheckGA, which site owners used to verify their IP Anonymization. CheckGA performed 38,485 scans for 14,023 sites in total. 12,047 of the sites are not in our dataset. Assuming that sites in our dataset were predominantly scanned by their respective owners, half of the notified owners (46.9%) used the tool at least once for their site(s). Table 2 shows the assumed fraction of owners who used the tool and compares owners who remediated the issue (Ur) with those who did not (Uu).

Figure 3 shows the number of scans per day during our observation phase of nine weeks. First notifications were sent on the Friday of Week 0 (cf. Section 5.1). A scan is considered related to a website in the dataset if the domain for the user-provided URL is in the dataset itself or redirects to a domain in the dataset. Related scans are those in which likely site owners of our study scan other sites not contained in the dataset. We define a scan as related if it targets a site not in the dataset, but there is another scan targeting a site in the dataset, and both scans are performed by the same user, identified by the same TLS session or truncated IP address on the same day. All other scans are considered unrelated to the dataset.

To evaluate the number of CheckGA scans performed until a site in our dataset becomes compliant, we counted the scans until all user-initiated subsequent scans found the site to be compliant. Users performed a median of two scans before a site was either remediated or stayed non-compliant without further scans, with no major differences in mean (4.5 vs. 4.16). Thus, users either got IP Anonymization right quickly or gave up early.

It took sites a median of 2.22 hours from the first scan to remediation, with a considerably larger mean of 5.05 days. The fastest 25% of remediating sites became compliant within 3.3 minutes; however, it took over 28 hours to reach 75% compliance, indicating that there are no outliers but a significant amount of site owners who need extended time to remediate. Considering the lower number of scans, site owners who need extended time possibly reach out for help or pass the issue within their organization.

### Support and Complaints
During the study, we were in contact with many owners who asked questions about our notification, requested help, or questioned the veracity and authenticity of our message. In total, we received 946 emails (not counting auto-replies), 41 letters, and 56 phone calls from 764 recipients. We sent 374 emails, one letter, and issued twelve phone calls in reply.

**Authenticating the Message:**
In total, 32 recipients (4.2% of those in contact with us) contacted us to verify that the message was authentic. They often chose a different contact address by searching for the sender online and contacting them via their personal addresses listed on the university homepage, or calling phone numbers they found online or in the letter. Two contacted the sender via Twitter. The tone of the messages was often friendly and curious, but sometimes hostile, alleging bad intentions or complaining that the message was hard to understand. Most could be placated with a cover story without mentioning that they were part of a study.

**Requesting Help:**
204 recipients (26.7%) asked questions about how to remediate the misconfiguration, requested verification of their remediation, or sometimes even offered us login information for the webserver—so we can fix the problem for them, “if it is that important to you.” We provided instructions on addressing the misconfiguration but did not take any actions to remediate the websites directly.

**Complaints:**
19 recipients (2.5%) complained about our messages. While some were simply unhappy with the unsolicited message or expressed that the tone of the message had been stressful for them, others went further and threatened legal action, tried to bill us for the time they spent on our notification, or even contacted the chancellor of one involved university to complain directly. We placated these recipients and removed them from future messages upon request. The assistance of our legal collaborators proved invaluable in many cases. No legal action was filed against the involved researchers or universities.

**Thanks:**
Finally, we also received messages of gratitude from 260 recipients (34%), ranging from simple messages to offers of payment, discounts, or gifts. Some recipients sent unsolicited packages with gifts, ranging from free magazines and mugs to a donation to one involved university. Whenever possible, we turned down any offered gifts or payments.

### Repair vs. Removal
So far, we have treated GA being anonymized and completely removed from a website as equivalent (cf. Section 4.7). However, for site owners, this difference is important, as it changes the insight they get into the behavior of their users. Surprisingly, we found that 36% of the notified owners who became compliant did so by completely removing GA from their site. This behavior was largely consistent across all experimental groups, indicating that it was not related to any specifics of the notification. To investigate the correctness of this result, we visited 50 of these pages and manually confirmed that they had removed Google Analytics (and not simply hidden it behind a cookie consent banner), finding no false negatives.

### Long-Term Effects
Our analysis so far only considered whether the problem was solved, but not if it stayed solved. To answer this question, we crawled all 4754 websites in the study again at the beginning of April 2020 (seven months after the end of the study) to evaluate how many of the previously-compliant websites had become non-compliant again. Out of 2224 websites that had become compliant at the end of the study period, 78 (3.5%) were non-compliant in April (six of the 78 in CONTROL). Another 38 (1.7%) were unreachable. We thus see a long-term effectiveness of approximately 95%.

Conversely, of the 2371 sites (550 of which in CONTROL) that remained non-compliant at the end of the study period, 438 non-control (24.1%) and 82 from the control group (14.9%) were compliant by the beginning of April (not checking consent banners). Another 63 were unreachable. Thus, the base rate of remediations is low (14.9% over seven months), and the notifications seem to have caused a slight increase in the remediation rate even after the study.

### Survey
To understand their perspective, we invited the website owners to participate in a survey in the debriefing message. The survey is shown in the supplementary material [33]. Responses from 477 owners are included in the following analysis. The value of participants \( N \) varies because the survey did not include any obligatory questions and some items were follow-up questions or only shown for certain groups.

#### Problem Awareness
371 out of 461 (80.5%) website owners knew that they were using GA on their website before being notified. 272 out of 462 (58.9%) had heard of the IP Anonymization feature before being notified. 58 out of 458 (12.7%) were aware of the missing IP Anonymization before being notified. We asked those website owners whose IP Anonymization had not been remediated why they did not take action.
