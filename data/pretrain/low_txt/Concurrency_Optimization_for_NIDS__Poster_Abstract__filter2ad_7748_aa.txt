### Plenary Abstracts

**Plenary Session 1: The Marriage of Technology Development and Biological Discovery**
- **Date and Time:** Monday, June 24, 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Joshua Rabinowitz, Lewis-Sigler Institute, United States

**Abstract:**
Twenty years after the sequencing of the first human chromosome, we now have powerful tools for measuring all fundamental classes of biomolecules, including metabolites. While the data-gathering capacity of these tools is impressive, the complexity of biology remains humbling. These tools have not yet substantially eliminated major diseases, including metabolic diseases. In this lecture, I will describe our past and ongoing efforts to bridge metabolomic technology development and biological discovery. I will provide examples of how intensive biological focus has improved our metabolomic pipelines and how isotope tracing has illuminated otherwise obscure aspects of metabolism. Examples will be drawn from microbiology, cell biology, and cancer. A major focus will be on our recent efforts to quantitatively revisit mammalian metabolism, with an eye towards better understanding both basic metabolic principles and the intersection of diet, metabolism, and disease.

**Plenary Session 2: Twin and SNP-based Studies of Metabolomic Traits**
- **Date and Time:** Tuesday, June 25, 8:30 a.m. – 9:30 a.m.
- **Presenting Author:** Dorret I. Boomsma, Netherlands Twin Register, Vrije Universiteit, Netherlands

**Abstract:**
Metabolite profiling allows for an increased understanding of behavioral and psychiatric phenotypes. We hypothesized that promising metabolites in this respect include those for which a genetic component is present, estimated heritability (h²: standardized estimate of genetic variance) based on the different genetic relatedness of mono- and dizygotic twin pairs. 

We analyzed metabolomics data from four different platforms for up to 5,117 individuals, including some family members of twins. Our estimates suggest that approximately 50% of the variation is due to genetic variation, but heritability estimates differed across metabolite classes and lipid species. Heritability can also be estimated from genotype data (SNPs: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) by quantifying the genetic similarity.
