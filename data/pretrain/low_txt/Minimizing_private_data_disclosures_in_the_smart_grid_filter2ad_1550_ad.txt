### Figure 3: One-Minute Data with Three Mutual Information Metrics
**Description:**
- **(a) and (b):** Mutual information (MI) between \( e'(t) \) and \( d'(t) \) under the independence assumption.
- **(c) and (d):** MI between the binary version of \( e'(t) \) and \( d'(t) \) under the independence assumption.
- **(e) and (f):** MI between \( e'(t) \) and \( d'(t) \) under the Markov assumption.

**Subplots:**
- **(a):** Varying battery capacity with dataset M1.
- **(b):** Varying datasets with battery set at 0.5 KWh.
- **(c):** Varying battery capacity with dataset M1.
- **(d):** Varying datasets, with battery set at 0.5 KWh.
- **(e):** Varying battery capacity with dataset M1.
- **(f):** Varying datasets with battery set at 0.5 KWh.

**Battery Capacity (KWh):**
- 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

**Datasets:**
- M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6

**Conditions:**
- BE (Base Energy)
- NILL (No Load)
- LC (Low Capacity)
- LS1 (Load State 1)
- LS2 (Load State 2)
- RC (Recharge)

**Note:**
- Smaller values of mutual information indicate better privacy.
