### Requirement for Asymmetric Cryptography in IoT Standards

The inclusion of hardware support for asymmetric cryptography in standards such as ZigBee is essential. As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand and integrate into more aspects of daily life, the importance of robust security protocols becomes increasingly evident. Historical data underscores the significance of well-designed security practices and their implementation. Collaborative efforts are necessary to leverage our collective knowledge and protect IoT devices. Failure to do so may result in large-scale attacks that could impact every facet of our lives.

### Appendix: ATMega2564RFR2 Leakage Analysis

#### Characterization of ATMega2564RFR2 AES Engine

The ATMega2564RFR2 microcontroller was suspected to have a leaky hardware AES engine, based on previous studies demonstrating similar leakage in the ATMega128RFA1 and Atmel XMEGA devices [11], [12]. To determine the approximate number of traces required for our test setup, we characterized the leakage of the AES-ECB peripheral in the ATMega2564RFR2. The device was operated at 4 MHz during this phase, although its normal operating frequency is 16 MHz. This adjustment was made to ensure reliable operation with the SPI flash and bus pirate connections.

#### Black-Box Attack and Correlation Analysis

The characterization phase was also crucial for the black-box attack, as the exact encryption mode and the specific points of encryption in the bootloader were unknown. The unique signature of the ATMega2564RFR2 during hardware AES encryptions allowed us to correlate known signatures with unknown traces, making the detection visually obvious (as shown in Figure 8).

For attacking the AES-ECB mode, a first-order CPA (Correlation Power Analysis) attack was employed using the leakage model from [11], [12]. Figure 12 illustrates the correlation peaks for two of the 16 bytes, which exhibit both positive and negative components. Combining these peaks improved the attack efficiency. Additionally, windowing was applied to mitigate the occurrence of larger, incorrect peaks a few hundred cycles before the correct peak, as reported in [12].

In practice, the power signature makes it straightforward to determine where the AES hardware operation is occurring. Thus, with minimal experimentation, we could apply the window offsets determined from the reference platform to the CPA attack on the 'black-box' device.

#### Determining the Number of Traces

To ascertain the number of traces needed, we performed 50,000 AES-ECB encryptions on our reference platform. We used partial guessing entropy (PGE) to measure the attack success, which indicates the number of incorrect guesses required for each key byte based on the information available after processing N traces [36]. A PGE of 0 means the key byte was fully recovered. These results, shown in Figure 13, indicate that byte 0 is the most difficult to recover, requiring about 2000 traces, while the other 15 bytes can be recovered with approximately 800 traces.

Given no limit on the number of traces, we acquired around 5000 traces for each block of interest, ensuring a high likelihood of recovering the true key without needing to enumerate any 'most likely' options.

#### Power Analysis of the Bootloader

For the power analysis of the actual bootloader, we needed multiple power traces where the bootloader decrypts the same block with random input values. This was achieved by using a low-cost SPI programmer to quickly rewrite the SPI flash chip and toggling the ATMega2564RFR2 reset pin. This process caused the bootloader to attempt loading the binary, which would fail due to an invalid signature, but by this point, the required operations for power analysis had already been performed.
