### Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and SCADA Networks
- **Challenges:**
  - The demands on ICS and SCADA networks often conflict with security requirements.
  - Understanding your network and data flows is crucial.
  - Basic knowledge is sufficient to start.

- **Security Measures:**
  - Adapt some enterprise IT concepts with modifications.
  - Build relationships between enterprise IT and industrial IT.
  - Implement network segmentation.
  - Control portable media.
  - Manage configurations and patches.
  - Plan for disaster recovery.
  - Develop and train the workforce.

- **Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA):**
  - Widely accepted in the ICS industry.
  - Compatible with multiple standards such as ISA95, ISA99, and IEC 62443.
  - Uses zone and conduit concepts.
  - Layers 0/1-5 represent different levels of network segregation.
  - Traffic within the same zone is allowed, while traffic between zones is controlled.
  - Layer 2 (L2) can set/change values on L1.
  - Layer 3 (L3) can only read values from L2 and L1.
  - Control points allow for reporting.

- **ICS Applications:**
  - Often misbehave due to non-stateful communication.
  - Protocols like MODBUS and DNP3 have been subverted.
  - Some vendors are adapting to ICS:
    - Tofino (C1D2, DIN rail mount)
    - Palo Alto (Rack mount only for now)

- **Patch Management:**
  - Field personnel's top concern.
  - Vendors must approve OS and app patches.
  - Monthly patching is not feasible.
  - Time for testing environments is essential.
  - USB and removable media control.
  - Anti-virus and anti-malware.
  - Application whitelisting.
  - Patch management for EWS and servers.
  - Corporate IT has these systems, but ICS cannot patch as frequently.
  - Different application and OS security models.
  - Dependency on directory services (AD).

- **Remote Support and Maintenance:**
  - Breaches have occurred (e.g., Telvent, Target).
  - Vendors often do not recommend a security architecture.
  - Incident response requires centralized logging and traffic analysis.
  - Tools like Logstash, Elasticsearch, and Cacti can be used.
  - Restoring PLC programming or device configurations can be challenging.
  - Specialized ICS Configuration Management software exists:
    - MDT AutoSave
    - Siemens TeamCenter

- **Training and Certifications:**
  - Specific ICS security trainings and certifications are uncommon.
  - SANS/GIAC, Idaho National Laboratory (INL), and third-party training offered by consulting/services companies.
  - Blends Infosec with ICS sensitivities.
  - Targeted for existing IT skillsets.

- **Disaster Recovery:**
  - Often considered as having equipment spares on site.
  - Rapid restoration of services may not be planned.
  - Business impact analysis is key.
  - Updated lists of vital assets and personnel must be maintained.
