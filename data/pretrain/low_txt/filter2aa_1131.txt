**2. Motivations**
- Analyze existing vulnerabilities and attack surfaces of GSM networks.
- Governments hack their own citizens.
- Surveillance implants have shifted focus to telecom networks and network devices.
- European Telco companies are highly concerned after the Regin attack.
- Rootkits are fascinating: there is much to learn and many challenges.
- Reproduce the attack scenario and implement it.

---

**3. GSM Network Architecture**
- **Overview:**
  - The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network architecture consists of several components, including the Base Transceiver Station (BTS), Base Station Controller (BSC), Mobile Switching Center (MSC), and Home Location Register (HLR).
- **Regin Targets GSM Networks:**
  - Regin is a sophisticated malware that targets GSM networks, exploiting various vulnerabilities in the architecture.

---

**4. Determining Attack Surface**
- **Potential Attack Surfaces:**
  - Absence of physical intrusion detection devices.
  - Vulnerable services running on BTS.
  - Lack of tamper resistance and unauthorized access protection.
  - Improper network segmentation; inner non-routable segments of the Telco company may be accessible.
  - Core GPRS Network and Network Subsystem (NSS) could be exploitable.

---

**5. GRX Networks**
- **Overview:**
  - GPRS Roaming Exchange (GRX) interconnects networks, allowing your local GSM provider to offer services abroad.
  - Trust-based, highly interconnected network designed for internet sharing.
  - A failure or malicious activity can affect multiple connected machines.
  - Multiple attack vectors, not limited to a particular segment where the attack originates.
- **Network Flow:**
  - Juicy information is here.
  - And more juicy information is here.
- **Attacks & Flaws:**
  - Are you telling me all your communication is intercepted and logged, including your physical location?

**6. SS7 & SIGTRAN**
- **SS7 Introduces Procedures for:**
  - User identification, routing, billing, and call management.
  - Flow control of transmitted information.
  - Traffic congestion controls.
  - Peer entity status detection (GT + PC or SPC).
  - Traffic monitoring and measurement.
- **Protocol Analysis:**
  - All the juicy info here:
    - Calling number
    - Called number
    - Call duration
    - Call status
- **Practical Attack Scenarios:**
  - Intercepting subscribers' calls.
  - Subscriber service change attacks.
  - Interception of SMS messages.
  - Interception of outgoing calls.
  - Redirection of incoming or outgoing calls.
  - Making changes in user bills or balance.
  - Unblocking stolen mobile devices (Source: IEEE August 2015, Nokia Researchers, Espoo, Finland).

**7. Rootkit Techniques**
- **Hardware/Software Interception: Captain Hook Style Hacking:**
  - Intercepts every function, keeps a copy of the content, and then lets the function continue as it was supposed to.
- **Regin Platform Structure:**
  - Multi-stage and encrypted framework structure.
  - Modules are invoked via Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) by the framework.
  - Malware data are stored inside the Virtual File System (VFS).
  - Challenges, Hurdles & Difficulties.
- **Solution:**
  - Check similar work and the write-up: [Link](http://artemonsecurity.com/regin_analysis.pdf)

**8. Regin Platform Stages**
- **Stage 1:**
- **Stage 2:**
- **Stage 3 & 4:**
  - How to Weaponize it?
    1. Register a callback function to a process.
    2. Log the PID of the target process.
    3. Obtain PEB via ZwQueryInformation() for base addresses of the modules.
    4. Obtain the EP via PsLookupProcesByProcess().
    5. Get inside the process context via KeStackAttachProcess() referenced by EP.
    6. Read PEB and other data in the process context.
