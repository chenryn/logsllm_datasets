## Abstract
Large content providers establish points of presence (PoPs) around the world, each connected to tens or hundreds of networks. While this connectivity is intended to enhance service delivery, providers often face capacity constraints on preferred peering paths, volatile traffic patterns, and the limitations of the 20-year-old Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). These challenges make it difficult to fully leverage the available connectivity.

We introduce Edge Fabric, an SDN-based system we developed and deployed at Facebook to address these issues. Serving over two billion users from dozens of PoPs across six continents, Edge Fabric operates in near real-time to optimize traffic routing and avoid congestion. Our evaluation using production traffic worldwide demonstrates that Edge Fabric efficiently utilizes interconnections without degrading performance. We also present real-time performance measurements of available routes and explore their integration into routing decisions. This paper shares insights, solutions, and lessons learned from four years of operating and evolving Edge Fabric.

## 1 Introduction
Internet traffic has evolved significantly over the past decade, with a small number of large content providers, cloud providers, and content delivery networks (CDNs) now sourcing the majority of traffic. For instance, ten Autonomous Systems (ASes) alone contribute 70% of the traffic, compared to thousands of ASes a decade ago. This consolidation is largely driven by the rise of streaming video, which now constitutes the majority of traffic in North America and requires both high throughput and low latency.

To meet these demands, providers have established numerous Points of Presence (PoPs) globally, interconnected with multiple other ASes. This rich interconnectivity offers shorter paths and more routing options, but the traditional BGP protocol is not well-suited to manage the high-volume, consolidated traffic. Specifically, BGP lacks awareness of capacity and performance, leading to suboptimal routing decisions and potential congestion.

This paper presents our experience addressing these challenges at Facebook, which serves two billion users from dozens of PoPs. We make three primary contributions:

1. **Network Connectivity and Traffic Characteristics:** We describe the network design and traffic characteristics that make it challenging to manage egress traffic. At Facebook, PoPs often have multiple routes to client networks, and traffic demand can be highly unpredictable. Despite the rich connectivity, individual path capacities and irregular traffic patterns make dynamic routing essential.

2. **Edge Fabric Design:** We introduce Edge Fabric, an SDN-based system that optimizes egress traffic routing. Edge Fabric monitors capacities and demand, determines optimal route assignments, and injects these routes into peering routers, overriding BGP's default selections. Deployed in production for over four years, Edge Fabric has been evaluated and refined to handle Facebook’s scale and technical challenges.

3. **Performance Measurements and Insights:** We instrument Edge Fabric to continuously measure performance along alternate paths, not just the best choice. Our measurements from four PoPs show that 5% of prefixes could see a reduction in median latency of 20+ms by choosing an alternative to BGP’s preferred route.

## 2 Setting

### 2.1 Points of Presence
Facebook has deployed PoPs in dozens of locations globally to reduce user latencies. Each PoP consists of racks of servers, intermediate aggregation switches (ASWs), and multiple peering routers (PRs). ASWs maintain BGP sessions with PRs and rack switches. PoPs cache content and terminate user TCP connections, providing the benefits of split TCP and TLS termination.

A single PoP announces each most-specific Facebook prefix, and a global load balancing system directs users to the “best” performing PoP via DNS and URL injection. This system uses performance measurements to direct users to nearby PoPs, subject to capacity and other constraints.

Figure 1 illustrates a typical PoP architecture, and Figure 2 shows the relative traffic volume served from 20 PoPs, selected for geographic and connectivity diversity. These PoPs serve 95% of Facebook’s traffic, with 95% of the traffic coming from clients in approximately 65,000 prefixes. Figure 3 further details the distribution of client prefixes per PoP.
