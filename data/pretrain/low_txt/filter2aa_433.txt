**Warning:**
This document is a work in progress and may contain omissions or typographical errors. Proceed at your own risk.

### Background
This document builds upon the original work by Glenn Hochwalt, Jr., W8AK, to convert the VHF Maxtrac to the 222 MHz band. Special thanks to Jeff Ackerman, KG6UYZ, for providing the radios for experimentation.

### Phase 0: Preparations
Ensure the radio is in good working order on its original frequencies before attempting the conversion to 222 MHz Amateur Radio use.

### Phase 1: Operating Frequency Reprogramming
We recommend using Maxtrac Lab RSS R07.02.00A for reprogramming. Earlier versions may not read all Maxtrac models. 

- **Programming Steps:**
  - Enter the frequency with the shift key held down.
  - All digit places must be entered.
  - Example: 223.5 MHz is entered as @@#.%))))

### Phase 2: VCO Modification
1. **RF Board Removal:**
   - Use a Torx T-10 driver to remove the RF board from the chassis.
   - Use a high-heat broad tip (e.g., Weller 800-degree PTC) to remove the coils and their housings.
   - Clean the holes with a stainless steel dental pick, solder wick, and solder sucker.

2. **Coil Replacement:**
   - Remove L213 (TX VCO Adjustable Coil, Yellow) and set it aside.
   - Remove L202 (RX VCO Adjustable Coil, Orange) and install it in the L213 position.
   - Remove L215 (TX VCO Fixed Coil, Yellow) and set it aside.
   - Remove L204 (RX VCO Fixed Coil, Orange) and install it in the L215 position.
   - Modify L215: Remove approximately 3 turns from the top, leaving 2.5 turns. Strip and tin the new lead, then install the modified L215 in the L204 position.
   - Modify L213: Extract the plastic housing from the metal shield, short the top 3 turns on the side with the most wires, and apply solder to the top 2 turns on all other sides. Reinstall the modified L213 in the L202 position.
   - Modify L221: Remove 3 turns from the top, strip and tin the new lead, and reinstall L221 in its original position.

3. **Testing:**
   - Replace the RF board and test the RX VCO by coupling a signal into a spectrum analyzer or frequency counter. Tune the coil at L202 until stable on the desired frequency (RX frequency + 45.1 MHz). The "SV" test point should read approximately 7.8V.
   - For additional tuning range, bend the coil at L215 on its side.
   - Insert a 47 ohm resistor into the TX VCO jack, PTT the radio, and tune the TX VCO. The "SV" test point should read approximately 7.8V.

### Phase 3: Low Pass Filter
1. **Modification:**
   - Bend a turn off the end of each LPF coil (L2x62, L2x61, L2x60, and L2x51) and lay the turn approximately 45 degrees away from the rest of the coil. This will bring the 3dB corner up to approximately 235 MHz.

2. **Tuning:**
   - Connect a spectrum analyzer to the PA, sweep into the antenna port, and detect the signal on the RX cable. Use a test jig with a BNC barrel and a ground ring connected to the BNC connector.

### Phase 4: Receiver
1. **Coil Modification:**
   - Remove the RF board and modify coils L1 - L7 one at a time. Short the top two turns on the side with the most wires visible. Reinstall the modified coil without the shield for initial testing.
   - Check receiver sensitivity using a service monitor. Additional turns may be shorted for optimal performance. My receiver achieved -110dB for 12dB SINAD without further tuning. If satisfactory, reinstall the metal shields on the coils.

### Phase 5a: 2W VHF Power Amplifier
The 2W VHF PA should produce 2 watts of power at 222 MHz without modifications. Some tweaking of L2362, L2361, and L2360 may be done to achieve maximum power output.

### Phase 5b: 25W VHF Power Amplifier
See Phase 5c.

### Phase 5c: 45W VHF Power Amplifier
1. **Board Removal:**
   - Remove the PA board from the heat sink. Desolder the power connector, unscrew the Torx screws, and desolder the antenna jack.
   
2. **Module Installation:**
   - The 45W VHF PA does not operate well above 175 MHz. Cut a section of the printed circuit board and install a power brick. Choose a suitable power module based on availability and drive requirements.
   - Remove Q2450 and L2421, and cut the board accordingly. Salvage ferrite beads and solder them to the DC input leads of the power module.
   - Patch any cut traces with wires. Flatten the heat sink and drill/tap holes for 6-32 screws to secure the module.
   - Install mini coax cables for the RF output and power input. Apply thermal compound and screw the module and PA board in place.
   - Add bypass capacitors and ground wires as needed. Tweak L2462, L2461, and L2460 for maximum power output.

### Phase 5d: 2W VHF Power Amplifier to 30W Modification
1. **Board Modification:**
   - Cut the board and modify the amplifier similar to Phase 5c. Replace R2371 with a 0.01 Ohm 2W resistor.
   - The junction of R2371 and C2378 will provide either VCC or 2nd VCC depending on the power module chosen.
