## Abstract
This research opportunity explores the design and implementation of a next-generation Internet that is secure, available, and privacy-centric. By first understanding the optimal potential of a network, we can then integrate these ideas into the current Internet or develop strategies for transitioning to a new architecture. The project addresses the critical need for high availability and security in the face of malicious actions, while also considering economic and policy issues.

## Speaker Bio
Adrian Perrig is a Professor of Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich, where he leads the Network Security Group. From 2002 to 2012, he was a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Engineering and Public Policy, and Computer Science (courtesy) at Carnegie Mellon University. During this period, from 2007 to 2012, he also served as the Technical Director for Carnegie Mellon’s Cybersecurity Laboratory (CyLab). He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University under the guidance of J. D. Tygar, and spent three years during his Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley. He received his B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL).

Adrian has been recognized with numerous awards, including the NSF CAREER Award in 2004, IBM Faculty Fellowships in 2004 and 2005, the Sloan Research Fellowship in 2006, the Security 7 Award in the category of education by Information Security Magazine in 2009, the Benjamin Richard Teare Teaching Award in 2011, and the ACM SIGSAC Outstanding Innovation Award in 2013. His research focuses on building secure systems, particularly secure future Internet architectures.

## Introduction
The Internet's success has exceeded even the most optimistic expectations, permeating almost all aspects of our society and economy. This success has created a dependency on communication, and many processes underpinning modern society would be severely disrupted if communication were to become unavailable. However, the current state of safety and availability of the Internet does not match its importance.

While it is difficult to quantify the exact impact of a 1-minute, 1-hour, 1-day, or 1-week outage, anecdotal evidence suggests that even short outages have a significant negative impact on governmental, economic, and societal operations. The Internet was not designed with high availability in mind, especially in the face of malicious actions. Recent efforts to improve Internet security and availability have been constrained by the existing architecture, business models, and legal frameworks. Additionally, fundamental design decisions in the current Internet inherently complicate secure operation.

One of the key challenges in today's Internet is scaling the authentication of entities, such as AS ownership for routing, name servers for DNS, and domains for TLS, in a global environment. Current Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) models, which are based on monopoly and oligarchy, do not scale globally because mutually distrusting entities cannot agree on a single trust root, and everyday users cannot evaluate the trustworthiness of each of the many root CAs in their browsers.

## Research Objectives
To address these issues, our research aims to design a next-generation Internet that is secure, available, and privacy-centric by design. We will also explore appropriate incentives for transitioning to the new architecture and consider economic and policy issues at the design stage. This research environment offers a unique opportunity for security researchers, providing a critically important problem space with a variety of challenges and the freedom to think creatively without limiting constraints.
