### MDM Server and Communication

The Mobile Device Management (MDM) server communicates over HTTPS, serving the MDM API. When an iOS device receives an MDM push notification, it contacts the MDM server at the URL configured during the device's enrollment for management. The device then queries the MDM server directly for the sent command. The response to the downloaded command is sent back to the MDM server over HTTPS. Optionally, the MDM server can provide a Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) server on TCP port 1640, which is also built on top of HTTP. For more detailed information on the MDM API, refer to David Schuetz’s presentation "Inside Apple’s MDM Black Box" from BlackHat USA 2011, available at [this link](https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-11/Schuetz/BH_US_11_Schuetz_InsideAppleMDM_WP.pdf).

### Lion Server Profile Manager

Lion Server’s Profile Manager is a Ruby-on-Rails web application that functions as both an MDM API server and an administration console. Initial setup and configuration are performed through the Server app, but most administrative tasks are managed via a web browser.

Profile Manager can apply settings on a per-user, user group, device, or device group basis. If the device owners have accounts in Open Directory, they can log in directly to the Profile Manager web application to enroll and manage their devices. For shared devices or users without Open Directory accounts, a Lion Server administrator must enroll the devices. Profile Manager supports an "Enrollment Profile" to facilitate remote management without requiring the user to log in to the Profile Manager web application. This chapter assumes that device owners also have accounts in Open Directory on the Lion Server. For more information on using Enrollment Profiles, consult the eBook "Managing iOS Devices with OS X Lion Server" by Arek Dreyer from Peachpit Press.

### Setting Up Profile Manager

To set up Profile Manager, follow these steps:

1. **Launch the Server Application:**
   - Open the Server application and click on Profile Manager in the sidebar. This will bring up the basic Settings pane for Profile Manager.
   - Click the Configure button to start the initial setup.

2. **Configure Open Directory:**
   - If you haven't already configured your Lion Server as an Open Directory (OD) master, the setup process will guide you through this.
   - An Open Directory master is used by Profile Manager to store device settings per OD User and Group. You will be prompted for basic settings for the OD LDAP server, and the service will be configured and enabled.

3. **SSL Configuration:**
   - The Profile Manager web application is only accessible over SSL. It is crucial that communication with this web application is secure, as it is used for both device communication and profile administration.
   - Select an SSL certificate for the web service. Ideally, use a properly formed SSL web server certificate issued by a trusted CA or your organization’s internal CA. For smaller organizations or testing, you can use the certificate automatically generated when your server became an Open Directory master.

4. **Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) Configuration:**
   - To communicate with APNS, Profile Manager needs a client certificate to authenticate itself to Apple’s servers.
   - If not already configured, the setup process will request a free APNS certificate from Apple. All you need is an Apple ID, and it should be one created for your organization, not tied to a specific individual.
   - Enter your organization’s Apple ID to automatically create and download an APNS certificate.

5. **Finalize Configuration:**
   - After completing all the previous steps, you should see a confirmation screen indicating that your server meets all requirements to run Profile Manager.
   - Click the Finish button to return to the main Profile Manager configuration pane.

6. **Enable Configuration Profile Signing:**
   - For enhanced security, enable configuration profile signing by checking the Sign Configuration Profiles checkbox.
   - Select a code-signing certificate to sign the profiles. Use a certificate issued by a trusted CA or your organization’s internal CA.

7. **Start the Service:**
   - Click the switch in the upper-right corner to move it to the ON position to start the Profile Manager service.
   - You can now create a configuration profile through the Profile Manager web application. Click Open Profile Manager at the bottom of the Profile Manager configuration pane to begin.

### Creating Settings

1. **Log In:**
   - Log in to the Profile Manager using an administrator account for your Lion Server.

2. **Navigation:**
   - After logging in, you will see the main Profile Manager navigation screen with Library and Activity sections. If you have created an enrollment profile, there will also be an Enrollment Profiles section.
   - The navigation pane in the center allows you to select a particular entity, and the Configuration pane on the right enables you to manage the configuration profile for the selected entity.

3. **Default Configuration Profile:**
   - The Profile Manager configuration pane in the Server application allows you to select a default configuration profile that will be sent to newly enrolled users and devices. By default, this is the "Settings for Everyone" profile.
   - Edit the associated configuration profile by clicking the Edit button in the configuration pane.

### Enrolling Devices

1. **Prepare the Device:**
   - Ensure that your iOS device is on a network that can reach the server running Profile Manager.

2. **Connect to Profile Manager:**
   - Enter the URL of Profile Manager’s My Devices page into Mobile Safari’s URL bar. For a simple configuration, this will be at `https:///mydevices`. In a production deployment, you will likely send the URL to the Profile Manager to users over email or SMS.

3. **Log In:**
   - At the Profile Manager login page, log in as a user account that exists in Open Directory.

4. **Install Trust Profile:**
   - On the My Devices page, tap the Profiles tab to see a list of available profiles. Install the Trust Profile first, as it includes the certificates used to sign the other profiles.
   - Tap the Install button to the right of the Trust Profile name, and follow the prompts to install the profile.

5. **Enroll the Device:**
   - Go back to the My Devices screen and tap the Enroll button to enroll your device.
   - The green Verified label indicates that the profile’s signature has been verified and is trusted. Tap the Install button to install the Device Enrollment profile, enabling remote device management.

6. **Complete Enrollment:**
   - After the profile is installed, you will see a completion screen. You can tap More Details to view the certificates included in the profile and get more information on the Device Management profile.

### Summary

Any iOS device used to store or access sensitive enterprise data must be configured to protect it adequately. This includes requiring a strong passcode, auto-lock, and other security-related configuration settings. While manual configuration by IT administrators is possible, it is labor-intensive and error-prone. Centralized management is a better approach.

This chapter described two alternatives for centrally managing iOS configurations: the iPhone Configuration Utility and Lion Server’s Profile Manager. The iPhone Configuration Utility is easier and faster to set up but does not scale well to many devices. For larger numbers of devices, an MDM solution like Lion Server’s Profile Manager is more suitable. In addition to providing the same configuration features, an MDM solution also offers additional capabilities such as remotely locking, wiping, or clearing the passcode.
