# Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks and Exposure Maps

## Introduction
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks pose a significant threat to many scanning detection mechanisms. This document reviews the general construction and maintenance of basic exposure maps, along with their two primary applications: scanning detection and automated response.

## Resilience of Exposure Maps to DoS Attacks
The construction and maintenance of basic exposure maps are resilient to DoS attacks. Incoming scans, whether in bursts or sustained, do not increase the size of an exposure map, which reflects only the number of services offered by the host. While incoming scans need to be passively monitored and connection requests checked against the Network Exposure Map (NEM), the processing required is minimal. Any issues caused by a high volume of requests are more likely to affect other network elements, such as routers or firewalls, rather than the exposure map itself.

## Impact on Secondary Storage
In the scanning detection application, secondary storage can be adversely affected by large botnet DoS efforts. For example, a 100,000-system botnet executing a scanning campaign could consume 13.2 MB in the scanning activity log. A sustained scanning effort would exhaust disk storage in most networks. However, such an attack would also likely cause core network devices to fail.

The automated response application faces similar disk storage issues, plus the consumption of system detection state for source IP addresses added to the scanners list. A 100,000-system botnet would consume 400 KB of scanner list state. The most effective attack would involve spoofing source IP addresses to exhaust the scanner list state, potentially affecting the platform executing the automated response.

## Limitations
### Non-Standard Ports
One strength of the exposure map approach is that it maintains minimal state. It only needs to observe external connection attempts (SYN packets) and record the IP address and source port if there is a response (SYN-ACK). Port numbers are used to identify the offered service. However, users may install services on non-standard ports, such as an HTTP server using port 8080 instead of port 80. This can limit access as client systems must know the listening port number. In the case of creating a NEM for scanning detection, non-standard port usage should be detected after training when the NEM is vetted.

## Related Work
### Introduction and Development
The concept of exposure maps was introduced in a position paper [29] and developed as an attribution-free scanning detection technique. Preliminary analysis showed that it could detect both sophisticated and simple forms of network scanning activity. Exposure maps were also proposed to detect changes in the services offered in a network, allowing network operators to verify authorized activity or indications of a successful attack.

### Active Scanning
Active scanning software, both open-source and commercial, allows for security audits on hosts or networks [9, 27, 20]. Active scanning is integral to confirming compliance with network security policies but can be resource-intensive, requiring personnel to configure and operate the software and interpret results. Additionally, active scanning provides only a snapshot of the network at a given time.

### Passive Scanning
Passive scanning techniques continuously monitor hosts and services in a network. Extrusion detection [3] identifies unauthorized internal network activity by inspecting outbound traffic, aiming to stop outgoing attacks from compromised internal systems. The Passive Asset Detection System (PADS) [24] is a signature-based passive detection software that identifies hosts and services by inspecting outbound traffic. Snort [22], an open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS), has scanning detection capabilities through its preprocessor sfPortscan [21].

### Probabilistic Models
Leckie et al. [12] and SPICE [25] use probabilistic models to detect scanning activity by assigning connection probabilities to internal hosts based on normal network traffic. Jung et al. [11] use the Threshold Random Walk algorithm to identify scanning hosts based on their connection behavior.

### Network Darkspace
Network darkspace refers to unused IP addresses in a network. Commercial products [14, 7] use darkspace to detect malicious activity. A darknet is a large block of unused, Internet-routable addresses monitored for inbound packet activity. Greynets, defined by Harrop et al. [10], are regions of darknet address space containing some active systems, making it difficult for malware to avoid detection.

## Concluding Remarks
We are the first to exploit the use of exposure maps and introduce the concept of darkports. Unlike darknets and greynets, exposure maps can be used even in densely populated enterprise networks. The simplicity of the exposure map technique translates into efficient use of system detection state and computational resources, easily scaling for large networks.

Exposure maps can perform scanning detection and enable fine-grained automated responses to deny access to scanning systems. Our implementation of the exposure map scanning detection application had fewer false positives and negatives compared to Snort. The approach provides awareness of active hosts, network darkspace, and darkports, enhancing the fidelity of scanning detection.

In open network environments, exposure maps remain flexible enough to monitor a subset of the network, protecting core assets. We have developed a full implementation of this approach in software, which will be made available to the public.
