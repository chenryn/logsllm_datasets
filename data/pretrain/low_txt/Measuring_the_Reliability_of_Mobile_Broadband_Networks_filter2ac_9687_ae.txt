### Reductions in Downtime

The observed reductions in downtime are surprisingly high, considering that connections from different operators often share many potential failure sources, such as local weather conditions, cell towers, power outages, or transmission issues. The measured combined downtime is not significantly different from the theoretical downtime assuming independence. 

Secondly, the reduction in downtime heavily depends on the selection of the right pair of connections. As expected, operators that frequently camp on the same Radio Access Network (RAN) exhibit a higher correlation in their failure patterns, resulting in limited gains from combining such connections. For example, as shown in Figure 19, there is often little to no benefit in combining connections from Netcom and Tele2.

### Correlations in Loss

We also examined the correlations in loss between networks, using the same 5-minute intervals as in Section 5. Let \( P(A) \) denote the empirical probability that connection A experiences a loss rate higher than 10% in a given 5-minute interval, and let \( P(B) \) be the same for connection B. We calculated the conditional probability \( P(A|B) \) for each pair of connections from the same node and compared it to the unconditional probability \( P(A) \).

If the conditional probability ratio \( R = \frac{P(A|B)}{P(A)} \) is close to 1, it indicates that connections A and B fail largely independently. A high \( R \) value suggests that they tend to fail together. By Bayes' theorem, \( \frac{P(A|B)}{P(A)} = \frac{P(B|A)}{P(B)} \).

Figure 20 shows \( R \) for all pairs of connections at the same node, grouped by operators. We required that A and B have at least one full week of overlapping measurements to be included in the analysis. Note that in some cases, the number of events where both connections experience high loss may be very low, so the graph should be interpreted with caution.

Some observations are clear:
- Connections from different networks are not entirely independent.
- In 25 to 70% of connection pairs, the likelihood of high packet loss in connection A more than doubles when connection B experiences high loss.
- In 8 to 35% of the cases, the likelihood increases by more than tenfold.
- There are clear differences between operator pairs. The strongest pairwise dependence is for Netcom/Tele2 and Telenor/Network Norway, while the weakest dependence is between Ice and the other operators. This is expected, as Ice operates with a different technology, a much lower frequency band, and has a different customer mix and traffic pattern compared to the other operators.

### Summary of Findings

The results in this section indicate a significant potential for increased reliability through multi-homing to several Mobile Broadband (MBB) networks. Generally, there are clear differences in signal quality at a given location among operators, and exploiting two connections in parallel can potentially achieve 99.999% availability in many cases.

#### Mobile Broadband Measurement

In recent years, there has been growing interest from regulators, policymakers, and the networking community in measuring the performance of home and mobile broadband networks. Several regulators have initiated nationwide efforts, such as the US Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Measuring Broadband America initiative [7] and the annual activity by the Communications Regulatory Authority of Lithuania [5]. A study by Sundaresan et al. [23], partly based on FCC data, demonstrated the importance of long-term continuous monitoring from the edge for understanding and assessing home broadband performance. Our work is the first to present a country-wide assessment of MBB reliability, filling an important gap in this area.

Approaches for measuring MBB networks can be classified into three categories:

1. **Crowd-sourced user-initiated measurements**: Prominent examples include Mobiperf [2], an Android application that measures various performance metrics, and Speedometer. Nikravesh et al. [16] used extensive data sets contributed by users of these apps to perform a longitudinal analysis of MBB performance, highlighting significant performance differences across operators, access technologies, and regions. They also showed that MBB performance is not improving over time, necessitating continuous monitoring. Sommers and Barford [21] used crowd-sourced data from Speedtest.net to compare the performance of MBB to WiFi. While such approaches can complement dedicated infrastructure measurements, they are less reliable for continuous monitoring of MBB network stability.

2. **Measurements collected using dedicated infrastructure**: Examples include studies using laptops mounted on public buses [18] and low-cost notebooks [14] to compare the performance of multiple MBB operators. Our work falls into this category but is based on a much larger deployment in terms of the number of measured operators, connections, geographical distribution, and duration.

3. **Measurements based on network-side data**: Several studies have used network-side logs to assess various aspects of MBB performance, such as the impact of the Radio Resource Control (RRC) state machine [17], cellular traffic properties [20], HTTP performance [9], performance during crowded events [19], and TCP performance over LTE [11]. Such logs, however, are only available to operators. Our work complements these studies by providing end-to-end measurements that can help detect anomalies not easily identifiable by network-side monitoring alone.

#### Measurement Framework and Metrics

Several ongoing efforts aim to standardize large-scale measurement tasks [3] and define meaningful performance metrics for IP networks in general [22] and MBB networks in particular [12]. Sundaresan et al. [23] investigated the suitability of different metrics for characterizing home broadband performance, while Goga and Teixeira explored methods for estimating broadband access speed [8]. This paper presents a framework for assessing MBB reliability using a large-scale deployment, which we believe is a timely input to the ongoing efforts to define approaches and metrics for measuring MBB networks.

### Discussion and Conclusions

This work presents a framework for measuring reliability in MBB networks, based on the premise that end-to-end measurements can provide valuable insights into performance and stability issues. The main argument is that reliability must be measured at multiple levels, from the stability of the network connection to the reliability of the data plane and application layer performance. We believe this framework provides a good basis for describing the overall reliability of an MBB network.

Future work should extend this framework to include measurements that capture the effects of mobility on experienced reliability. Efforts are ongoing to expand the NNE infrastructure with mobile nodes, which would allow such measurements.

Using the proposed framework, we conducted a large-scale study of reliability in five Norwegian MBB networks, focusing on selected metrics at each level. There are still many other relevant metrics for understanding reliability, such as the ability to establish a Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context when needed, and further analysis of packet loss and delay variations under varying network conditions. Additionally, the reliability and performance of various transport layer protocols in MBB networks are important topics for future research.

Our measurements demonstrated clear differences in reliability between operators, which can be identified and characterized by end-to-end measurements. Networks vary in connection stability, packet loss patterns, and their ability to support popular applications. We also showed how end-to-end measurements can be used to identify failures and performance problems not necessarily captured by operators' monitoring systems.

This study was performed using the NNE infrastructure with dedicated measurement nodes. The framework is also applicable to studies based on crowd-sourced data from mobile phones, although such approaches may be more limited in metadata availability and the ability to gather long, uninterrupted time series under stable conditions.
