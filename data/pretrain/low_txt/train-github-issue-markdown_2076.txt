I have a simple class that extends another, where `ViewChild` is defined in the parent class, and the component is declared in the HTML template of each subclass. After updating from beta 6 to beta 11, I noticed that the `ViewChild` variable is now undefined. This issue was not mentioned in the breaking changes documentation, so I am unsure if it was ever intended to work this way or if it is a bug.

While I could restructure the code to make it functional again, which might even improve the overall structure, I would like to know if this behavior is expected or if it is indeed a bug. In the current version (beta 11), the `ViewChild` variable is undefined.
