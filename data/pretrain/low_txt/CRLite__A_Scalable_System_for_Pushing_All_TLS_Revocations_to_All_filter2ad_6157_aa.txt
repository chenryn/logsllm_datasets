**Abstract:**
Currently, no major browser fully checks for TLS/SSL certificate revocations due to the limitations of existing mechanisms (CRLs, OCSP, OCSP Stapling, CRLSet, and OneCRL), which are incomplete, insecure, inefficient, slow to update, not private, or some combination thereof. In this paper, we introduce CRLite, an efficient and easily-deployable system for proactively pushing all TLS certificate revocations to browsers. CRLite servers aggregate revocation information for all known, valid TLS certificates on the web and store them in a space-efficient filter cascade data structure. Browsers periodically download and use this data to check for revocations of observed certificates in real-time. CRLite does not require additional trust beyond the existing PKI and allows clients to adopt a fail-closed security posture even in the face of network errors or attacks that make revocation information temporarily unavailable.

We present a prototype of CRLite that processes TLS certificates gathered by Rapid7, the University of Michigan, and Google’s Certificate Transparency on the server-side, with a Firefox extension on the client-side. Compared to an idealized browser that performs correct CRL/OCSP checking, CRLite reduces latency and eliminates privacy concerns. Additionally, CRLite has low bandwidth costs: it can represent all certificates with an initial download of 10 MB (less than 1 byte per revocation) followed by daily updates of 580 KB on average. Our results demonstrate that complete TLS/SSL revocation checking is within reach for all clients.

**I. Introduction**

The TLS protocol, coupled with the web's Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), is the cornerstone of security for billions of users and organizations. TLS relies on certificates issued and cryptographically signed by Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide integrity, confidentiality, and authentication for web traffic. Most web browsing occurs over HTTPS. A critical but often overlooked aspect of the web's PKI is certificate revocation. When a CA erroneously issues a certificate or when a certificate's private key is compromised, it is imperative that the affected certificate be revoked. Otherwise, client software (e.g., web browsers) will continue to trust the certificate until it expires, potentially allowing attackers to perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) and phishing attacks. Thus, timely revocation and proper revocation checking by client software are crucial, especially in the wake of large-scale vulnerabilities like the Debian PRNG bug and Heartbleed, which potentially compromised millions of private keys.

Despite the importance of revocations, many client applications do not properly check for certificate revocations. Recent versions of Chrome only make CRL or OCSP requests for Extended Validation (EV) certificates, while Firefox only supports revocation checks via OCSP, and no major mobile browsers check for revocations at all. This state of affairs is due to latency concerns, bandwidth considerations, privacy risks, and ambiguity. 

Recent efforts, such as OCSP Stapling, Google’s CRLSets, and Mozilla’s OneCRL, aim to address these problems by moving from a pull model to a push model. However, these efforts are far from comprehensive. As of January 30, 2017, CRLSet and OneCRL contained 14,436 and 357 revocations, respectively, while there are over 12.7 million revoked but otherwise valid certificates issued by major CAs. These systems would have significant difficulty scaling to handle millions of certificates, and they require users to place unconditional trust in Google and Mozilla, as their data formats are not auditable.

In this paper, we present CRLite, a system for proactively pushing all certificate revocations to browsers on a regular basis. CRLite consists of a server-side system that aggregates revocation information for all known, valid TLS certificates and places them in a filter, and a client-side component that downloads filters and uses them to check for revocations of observed certificates.

**II. Background**

In this section, we provide an overview of the web's PKI, focusing on certificate revocation. We also discuss how web browsers currently implement revocation checking and survey recent work on alternative strategies for distributing revocations.

**A. The TLS Ecosystem**

Authenticity and confidentiality of communication on the web are provided by HTTPS, which uses a combination of the TLS protocol and a hierarchical PKI. In the web's PKI, trusted CAs are vested with the authority to issue X.509 certificates.
