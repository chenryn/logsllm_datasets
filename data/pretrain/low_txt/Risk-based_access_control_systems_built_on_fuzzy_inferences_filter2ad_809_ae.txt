### Conclusions

Current access control models provide a static approach to making access decisions for various applications. However, in dynamic and distributed systems, access control should be contextually and real-time data-driven. With the proliferation of sensors and devices, contextual information can be collected and utilized to create dynamic access control models. One such model is the risk-based access control (RBAC) model, which dynamically estimates the security risk associated with an access request to make informed access decisions. This model offers several benefits, particularly for emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing.

This paper presents a systematic literature review and analysis of the state-of-the-art in risk-based access control models, providing a detailed understanding of the topic. Based on the selected search strategy, 44 articles out of 1044 were chosen for a closer examination, focusing on recent risk-based models, risk factors, and risk estimation techniques. The results summarize the selected articles, offering a comprehensive view of different risk-based access control models from the perspective of various researchers.

Although there are several risk factors that can be applied in various contexts—such as risk history, which was adopted in 18 publications—the results show that the choice of risk factors is significantly context- or domain-dependent. Additionally, the results highlight that developing an efficient and accurate risk estimation technique applicable across different domains remains a major challenge. While some risk estimation approaches, such as decision trees, have shown promise, the lack of a comprehensive dataset to represent the likelihood and impact of each risk scenario in specific contexts is a key issue.
