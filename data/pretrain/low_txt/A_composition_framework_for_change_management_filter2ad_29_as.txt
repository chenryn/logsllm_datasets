### Closing
#### California Department of Technology
#### Organizational Change Management Framework

At the conclusion of each training session and/or after implementation, a variety of tools and methods should be employed to identify gaps in the Knowledge Evaluation and Transfer of Learning categories. The following methods can be used to accomplish this:

1. **Training Effectiveness Survey:**
   - The Training Effectiveness Survey allows course participants to evaluate their training experiences in areas such as usefulness and relevance.
   - The survey template includes a series of statements that participants can use to rate their experience.
   - This survey is generally used to collect feedback on individual courses and can be distributed in hard copy or electronic form.
   - Data from the surveys can be analyzed to identify patterns and gaps, generate metrics, and plan for future training opportunities.

2. **Feedback from Training Instructors/Facilitators/Coaches:**
   - Training instructors, facilitators, and coaches provide unique insights into the results and effectiveness of the training program.
   - These individuals are familiar with the objectives, content, and participants, and can identify topics of concern and areas where additional training may be needed.
   - They can also suggest strategies to address any identified training gaps and needs.
   - Feedback can be collected through informal one-on-one communications or through facilitated group sessions.

3. **End User Performance of New System:**
   - How end users use the new solution is a good indicator of gaps in the Transfer of Learning category.
   - Users who struggle with navigating and using the new system can be identified by collecting performance data.
   - Key data points may include the number of help desk calls, time to complete tasks, and the frequency of end users using the new system.
   - It is important to collect and monitor this data to identify where further training may be needed.

Using these methods, the training resources working with the OCM Practitioner can identify gaps that affect the new system's performance. This information can then be used to determine how to address these gaps with refresher training opportunities.

### Training Tools

### Outputs
- **Completed Training Effectiveness Surveys**

### Coordinate Development and Delivery of Ongoing Training
The ongoing training process should follow the guidelines set forth in the Training Plan. This effort includes both refresh training, which addresses training gaps, and new hire training, which provides training opportunities to new employees. The training resources working with the OCM Practitioner need to determine the level of effort, responsibility, and timeline for:
- Training material updates
- Quality assurance (e.g., training material and training effectiveness)
- Material storage
- Training delivery and management

The Training Plan should be used to identify and determine the best course for delivering ongoing training. For more information on planning, developing, and delivering training, review the Training section within the Executing Process Phase chapter. Consider the following:
- **Number of End Users:** If a small number of end users need refresh or new hire training, a more informal process using one-on-one coaching may be appropriate. If the needs are extensive, eLearning methods where content is available on demand may be considered.
- **Topics/Areas for Refresh and New Hire Training:** Training content will play a part in determining the extent of the ongoing training effort and delivery methods used. Complex topics may be best addressed in an instructor-led training effort, while simpler topics may be addressed with published help guides, job aids, or other tutorials. For refresh training, the OCM Practitioner should utilize the gaps in knowledge identified in training evaluation to determine the topics/areas of training.

The training resources, working with the OCM Practitioner, should continue to capture all training efforts during the Closing Process Phase in the Training Action Log that was started in the Executing Process Phase.

### Process Phase Checklist
#### 3.1 Complete the Checklist
The OCM Closing Process Phase Checklist identifies the OCM activities that are completed during the Closing Process Phase. Once all OCM activities within the Closing Process Phase are complete, the checklist can help the OCM Practitioner quickly and confidently identify areas of concern prior to the completion of the Project Management Lifecycle. Completion of the checklist provides a clear milestone that the necessary steps to officially close the project are complete.

### Tools
- **OCM Closing Process Phase Checklist**

### Using the OCM Closing Process Phase Checklist
- **Archived OCM Artifacts**
- **Completed Lessons Learned**
- **Completed Communication Action Log**
- **Implemented Deployment Communication Mechanisms**
- **Completed Training Effectiveness Surveys**
- **Completed Training Action Log**
- **Completed OCM Closing Process Phase Checklist**

### Outputs
- **Complete the OCM Closing Process Phase Checklist to validate that all process phase activities are complete.**

### Additional Resources
This chapter provides materials that are helpful for further understanding of Organizational Change Management (OCM) and the coordination and planning of OCM with project management and business process reengineering (BPR). Included are a glossary of OCM role definitions and terms.

### 1.1 Introduction
The CA-OCM is a practical guide to help the OCM Practitioner and project team successfully manage an OCM effort. This chapter introduces useful resources that provide additional information about elements of the CA-OCM and how it ties to other related State of California frameworks, such as the CA-PMF. The chapter also includes references to OCM-related resources that the OCM Practitioner or those involved in an OCM effort can use to further their knowledge.

The OCM Practitioner can refer to or use these resources at any point throughout the project; however, they may be particularly useful during project planning to provide context for the activities. Multiple illustrations are presented to provide context and promote coordination with project management and BPR.

### 1.2 CA-OCM Quick Reference
This section features graphics related to each of the knowledge area goals and key elements from each process phase. While the knowledge area goals and key elements are presented in CA-OCM chapters for each process phase, they are consolidated here across all process phases. The key elements include:
- Recommended practices
- Skills
- Roles
- Activities
- Tools
- Outputs

#### 1.2.1 Key Elements by Process Phase
Each chapter of the CA-OCM contains graphics that summarize the following elements broken out by process phase:
