To enhance security, restrict communication with the container service to local Unix sockets or remote access via SSH. Ensure that all API communications are conducted over a secure port using TLS by disabling unauthenticated access to the Docker API on port 2375. Instead, configure the system to communicate with the Docker API over TLS on port 2376.
