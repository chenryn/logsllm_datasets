## Introduction
Your IT organization has likely made significant investments in infrastructure and applications that have been supporting your business for years. Maintaining this infrastructure is costly, potentially consuming up to 80% of an IT budget. In addition to maintaining your IT infrastructure within budget, you are also focused on:

- Developing new applications
- Modernizing existing applications
- Implementing DevOps practices
- Migrating from expensive traditional databases
- Deploying flexible cloud-based environments
- Providing low-cost SaaS applications to consumers
- Establishing open-source software standards

Balancing maintenance and improvement under the pressure of rapid technological advancements and limited budget increases is becoming increasingly challenging. Some leading database vendors, including Oracle, employ strategies that lock customers into contracts with annually increasing costs, further straining budgets. This leaves little room for investing in new, integrated, smart, and mobile applications that can transform customer experiences.

Line-of-business managers and marketing executives see numerous opportunities to enhance business performance and customer satisfaction, but they are often frustrated by IT organizations constrained by tight budgets. As a result, many organizations are turning to EDB Postgres from EnterpriseDB (EDB) as a cost-effective yet capable alternative to traditional databases. EDB Postgres offers the performance, security, and manageability features required for most enterprise workloads, allowing organizations to redirect savings towards new mobile, analytics, web, cloud, social, or Internet of Things (IoT) applications that support customer-centric digital transformation initiatives.

For organizations using Oracle, EDB Postgres' compatibility with Oracle makes it an especially attractive option. This compatibility allows EDB Postgres to:

- Replace Oracle for new applications
- Modernize old applications
- Migrate applications off Oracle
- Coexist with existing Oracle infrastructure
- Leverage existing Oracle developer and DBA skills

Moreover, EDB Postgres natively understands and processes existing Oracle PL/SQL programs and data without requiring translation layers or lengthy consulting engagements, preserving your business logic and intellectual capital.

## Adapting to a Changing World
The rapid pace of technological change, particularly in data volume, variety, uses, and management, poses significant challenges for organizations of all sizes. By 2028, it is predicted that 75% of the companies in the S&P 500 will undergo substantial changes. This transformation is also reshaping the database market. Open-source relational DBMSs have matured and can now replace commercial RDBMSs at a considerable TCO saving. Information leaders, DBAs, and application development managers can consider them as a standard choice for deploying applications.

**Gartner predicts:**
- 70% of new applications will be on open-source relational databases by 2018.
- 50% of current applications will be on open-source relational databases by 2018.

Despite these changes, the rising costs of using Oracle remain a constant. Higher costs and complex licensing practices, combined with poor communication of licensing changes, have prompted many Oracle customers to seek alternatives.

## The EDB Postgres Platform Makes It Possible
Organizations are increasingly choosing EDB Postgres Enterprise as a standard RDBMS for new and existing applications. EDB Postgres Enterprise provides the performance, security, manageability, and features required to power enterprise workloads. EDB’s low-cost, open-source-based development model and subscription pricing lower consumption costs, allowing you to redirect savings to innovative new applications.

EDB Postgres is a fully integrated, enterprise-class data management platform that offers:
- Enterprise performance and capabilities
- Enterprise support and services
- Flexible deployment options
- Software lifecycle control
- A reliable roadmap
- A worldwide ecosystem of commercial partners

While open-source databases may be free to use, experienced managers understand the importance of partnering with a commercial provider for comprehensive support, service, and growth. Without a commercial-grade platform, organizations risk:
- Technically inferior solutions
- Complex integrations
- Delayed deployments
- Increased downtime
- Longer maintenance cycles
- Steeper learning curves
- Ongoing reliance on consultants

EDB Postgres provides a commercial-grade, open-source-based platform comparable to what you expect from your current database vendor but at a significantly reduced cost.

## EDB Business Practices Make You Profitable
Changing or acquiring a new database vendor is no small task. This paper aims to highlight the distinct business advantages of reducing reliance on Oracle and adopting EDB Postgres. EDB’s business practices are focused on fair value exchange and transparent win-win strategies. We offer lower prices due to our open-source development model, which reduces our costs. We pass these savings on to our customers and do not rely on contentious licensing policies to drive up costs.

We strive to be a trusted partner and make it easy to do business with us by offering:
- UniCore (universal core) pricing
- A comprehensive platform with bundled tools, support, and maintenance at no extra cost

## Business Model Comparison
EDB’s business model differs significantly from Oracle’s. EDB offers a simple, all-inclusive subscription model with no hidden fees, unbundled features, or penalties. The subscription includes all database features, tools, deployment environments, and maintenance costs. Subscription costs are accounted for as OpEx, making them easier to manage and discontinue without penalty.

In contrast, Oracle requires a large upfront capital expenditure for a perpetual license, followed by an annual maintenance fee of 22% of the license fee, which often increases by 3% annually. This can lead to significant and unpredictable cost increases.
