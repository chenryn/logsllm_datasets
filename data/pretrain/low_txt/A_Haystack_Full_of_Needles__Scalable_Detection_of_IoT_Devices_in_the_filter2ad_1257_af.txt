### End-User Manual Upgrades and Threat Mitigation

End-user manual upgrades, such as those designed to mitigate threats, can also be used to transition from DDoS attacks to identifying the culprits. Our approach is potentially scalable using Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) profiles [37], where devices signal to the network the types of domains, access, and network functionalities they require for proper operation. Additionally, it is possible to expand the list of IoT device signatures through crowdsourcing [38].

### 8. Related Work

Recent research has focused on understanding home IoT traffic patterns and identifying devices based on their signatures, trackers, and network traffic [39]. These approaches often rely on testbed data [4, 40] or tools for active discovery of household devices and their network traffic [41]. For instance, the authors in [40] use a broad range of network features from packet captures, including domain names, to train machine learning models and detect IoT devices in a lab environment. However, they do not further study the backend infrastructure supporting these devices.

There have also been early attempts at mitigating device discoveries using traffic padding [42] or blocking techniques [33]. Several recent efforts have focused on inferring IoT device types from network traffic [6, 43]. In [15], the authors used instrumented home gateways to analyze IoT traces from over 200 households in a U.S. city. Their analysis revealed that while the IoT space is fragmented, a few popular cloud and DNS services act as central hubs for the majority of devices and their data.

Generally, many IoT devices periodically connect to specific servers on the Internet. Authors in [26] and [34] proposed methods to identify IoT devices by observing passive DNS traffic and unique IP addresses. Unfortunately, many IoT devices rely on shared infrastructures, and different devices from the same vendor often connect to the same servers. Therefore, detection at the scale of ISP/IXP, based solely on IP addresses and port numbers without considering the role of shared infrastructures, is not very reliable.

Complementing the approaches based on testbeds and home gateways, there have been efforts to understand IoT traffic patterns using data from transit networks [44]. However, it has been challenging to successfully validate the derived signatures. Similar works relied on specific port numbers [45], which may also be used for specialized industrial IoT systems [46]. However, these approaches cannot be easily extended to general-purpose IoT devices and smart home systems that utilize popular ports, such as 443 and 80.

These related works indicate that neither data from core networks subject to sampling and middleboxes, nor data from a few devices using home gateways or testbeds, are sufficient for rapidly and accurately detecting IoT devices and understanding their anomalies and misconfigurations [10].

In this paper, for the first time, we complement detailed ground truth data from testbeds and a particular subscriber with large-scale data from an ISP and an IXP to reveal the aggregate behavior of these devices. We also demonstrate the ability to isolate and identify specific subscriber devices using sampled data at an ISP.

### 9. Conclusion

Home IoT devices are already popular, and their usage is expected to grow further. Therefore, we need to track their deployment without resorting to deep packet inspection or active measurements, both of which are intrusive and unscalable for large deployments. Our insight is that many IoT devices contact a small number of domains, making it possible to detect such devices at scale from sampled network flow measurements in very large networks, even when they are in idle mode. We show that our method can detect millions of such devices in a large ISP and an IXP that connects hundreds of networks.

Our technique can detect 4 IoT platforms, 20 manufacturers, and 11 products—both popular and less popular ones—at the vendor level and, in many cases, even at the product granularity. While this detection may be useful for understanding the penetration of IoT devices in homes, it raises concerns about the general detectability of such devices and the corresponding human activity.

In light of our alarming observations, as part of our future work, we aim to investigate how to minimize the harm of potential attacks and surveillance using IoT devices. We also want to use our insights to help ISPs tackle security and performance problems caused by IoT devices, such as by detecting them, redirecting their traffic, or blocking their traffic.
