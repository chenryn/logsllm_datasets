### 7. Limitations

#### Recruitment Bias
Our study did not conduct a comprehensive exploration of the entire ASO (App Store Optimization) worker population, and thus we cannot claim that our participants are a representative sample. The recruitment process is inherently biased because we only selected candidates who:
1. We could reach out to,
2. Responded to our invitation,
3. Were English speakers,
4. Agreed to participate after reviewing and approving the consent form, and
5. Met specific qualification criteria (i.e., control at least 100 accounts, have at least one year of ASO expertise, and have participated in at least 100 ASO jobs, as detailed in § 4.1).

For example, out of the 560 workers contacted, 72 replied to our invitation, 25 qualified, and 18 ultimately agreed to participate. Consequently, other ASO workers may have both fewer and more capabilities than those in our study. Despite this, the data and responses we collected reveal previously unknown ASO strategies, provide insights into the effectiveness of proposed defenses, and highlight vulnerabilities in Google's defense mechanisms.

Future work should explore the use of deception and more substantial financial incentives to increase recruitment success rates and identify novel ASO strategies. We believe our approach represents a best-effort attempt at recruiting workers without resorting to deceptive practices.

#### Generalization of Results
We have used crowdsourcing platforms such as Upwork, Fiverr, Zeerk, and PeoplePerHour for several years and found them to be reliable sources of ASO activities. Additionally, through contacts within the ASO community, we identified large Facebook groups specializing in ASO. However, we do not claim to have reached most active ASO workers.

Participants in our studies also claimed expertise in generating fake reviews and ratings on platforms like Google Maps, Apple Store, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as fake installs in the Apple App Store and fake likes and followers on Facebook and Instagram. However, we did not ask participants about their strategies on other platforms, so we do not claim that our findings apply to other sites or types of ASO work.

#### Validation of Findings
Due to the sensitive nature of the topic and the data collected, we conducted quantitative and qualitative studies with different sets of participants. Our quantitative study involved a subset of 39 participants. We corroborated multiple survey answers with quantitative measurements and manual verification by the authors. In § 5.14, we describe the validation process for the data collected in the quantitative study.

However, several participant claims, such as team organization, size, location, capabilities, interactions with employers, and the number of devices controlled, are difficult to validate. Given the nature of our participants, any suspicion regarding these topics is legitimate.

### 8. Conclusions

In this paper, we present results from the first structured interview study of 18 ASO workers recruited from five different sites, focusing on their fraudulent activities in Google Play. We also conducted a quantitative investigation with data collected from 39 additional ASO workers recruited from the same sites. Our findings include new insights into Google Play vulnerabilities and the capabilities, behaviors, and detection avoidance strategies of ASO workers.

The limitations of our study include the difficulty in recruiting participants and the sensitivity of the data. Therefore, our findings should be understood as situated information rather than generalized facts. Given the adaptive nature of fraud detection research, which involves the elimination of risks and vulnerabilities, our findings, despite their limitations, provide valuable suggestions for future research. Future studies should focus on collecting more diverse information to extend and ensure the continued relevance of our findings.
