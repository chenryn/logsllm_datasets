The SolarWinds Compromise was a sophisticated supply chain cyber operation conducted by APT29, discovered in mid-December 2020. APT29 used customized malware to inject malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion software build process, which was later distributed through a normal software update. They also used password spraying, token theft, API abuse, spear phishing, and other supply chain attacks to compromise user accounts and leverage their associated access. Victims included government, consulting, technology, telecom, and other organizations in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Industry reporting initially referred to the actors involved in this campaign as UNC2452, NOBELIUM, StellarParticle, Dark Halo, and SolarStorm.

In April 2021, the US and UK governments attributed the SolarWinds Compromise to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), citing APT29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes. (Citation: NSA Joint Advisory SVR SolarWinds April 2021) (Citation: UK NSCS Russia SolarWinds April 2021) (Citation: Mandiant UNC2452 APT29 April 2022) The US government assessed that of the approximately 18,000 affected public and private sector customers of SolarWinds’ Orion product, a much smaller number were compromised by follow-on APT29 activity on their systems.
