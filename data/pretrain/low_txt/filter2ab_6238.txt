**Title: Black Hat Asia 2019: CQTools - The Ultimate Hacking Toolkit**

The CQURE Team has developed over 200 hacking tools through extensive penetration testing. We have carefully selected the top 39 tools and compiled them into a comprehensive toolkit called CQTools. At Black Hat Asia, we are excited to unveil five new tools that will enable advanced privilege escalation and network attacks.

CQTools is designed to facilitate a wide range of attack scenarios within an infrastructure. It covers everything from initial reconnaissance and sniffing/spoofing activities to information and password extraction, custom shell and payload generation, code obfuscation to evade antivirus detection, and various keylogging techniques. These tools can be used to leverage extracted information for sophisticated attacks.

Some of the tools in CQTools are based on groundbreaking discoveries first released by the CQURE Team, and many have taken years to develop. Despite their complexity, all the tools are user-friendly and designed for practical use. CQTools is an essential resource for any penetration tester, providing a powerful and versatile set of tools that we use in our own cybersecurity engagements.

Join us at Black Hat Asia to see how CQTools can enhance your penetration testing capabilities and elevate your security assessments to the next level!
