### Computing Services and Task Completion Time

In the context of computing services, the time required to complete tasks initiated by a given fraction of nodes in a graph is relatively short for the majority of these nodes. This characteristic and its associated advantages are maintained even when up to 50% of the nodes are outsourcers of computations. This is in contrast to other graphs with dense structures and high connectivity, which are typically considered suitable for such applications. This observation encourages further investigation into the deployment scenarios of our design. We anticipate that the inherent structure of these deployment contexts, which may have varying social structures, will significantly influence the utility of the built computing overlay.

### Future Work

This paper opens several avenues for future research and calls for further investigation on multiple fronts. In the future, we aim to:

1. **Complete Missing Design Components:**
   - Extend the simulator to include additional deployment scenarios.
   - Consider failure conditions and various scheduling algorithms for both outsourcers and workers.
   - Incorporate overhead characteristics that may not align with topological features in the social graph, such as uptime, downtime, communication overhead, and I/O overhead consumption.

2. **Real-World Deployment:**
   - Transition from simulation settings to real-world deployment.
   - Address the options discussed in Section 6.6.
   - Implement a proof-of-concept application, as discussed in Section 3.3, using the design options presented in this paper.
   - Anticipate and address hidden complexities that may arise during the deployment, leading to significant findings.
