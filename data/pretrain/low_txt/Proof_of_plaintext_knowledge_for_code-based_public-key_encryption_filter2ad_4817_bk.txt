### Chapter 8: Conclusion

#### Summary of the Contributions

In this thesis, we introduce a new public-key encryption scheme that satisfies a strong security notion, preventing multiple users from colluding and performing complex, large-scale attacks. Our construction, which was first presented in [GHKW16], is the first CCA-secure encryption scheme with a tight security reduction from the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption, without using pairings. The ciphertexts are compact, containing only three group elements. Figure 1.1 provides an overview of the state-of-the-art for tightly CCA-secure encryption.

Our proof techniques diverge from previous works [HJ12, LJYP14, LPJY15] that use non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs with tight simulation soundness, for which there are no efficient constructions from standard assumptions without pairings. Other works [HKS15, AHY15a, GCD+16] first build a tightly-secure Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) to then obtain CCA-secure encryption. However, IBE is notoriously difficult to construct without pairings in the standard model [BPR+08], especially with a tight security proof and short ciphertexts. To eliminate the need for pairings, we revisit techniques from [CW13] and the hash-proof system approach used in [CS98].

We address the major limitation of our initial construction in [GHK17], where the size of the public key is reduced to a constant number of group elements, using techniques from [Hof17]. We chose to present the predecessor [GHKW16] in this thesis.

Additionally, we present new functional encryption schemes based on standard assumptions. We followed a bottom-up approach, exploring new constructions for larger classes of functions with new features, starting from simple constructions that rely on well-understood assumptions. Specifically, we extended the original functional encryption schemes for inner products from [ABDP15, ALS16] to a multi-input setting:

- **Chapter 4**: We present a multi-input functional encryption (MIFE) scheme for inner products based on the MDDH assumption in prime-order bilinear groups. Our construction supports any polynomial number of encryption slots and achieves adaptive security against unbounded collusion, relying on standard polynomial hardness assumptions. Prior to this work, published in [AGRW17], there were no candidates for 3-slot MIFE for inner products in the generic bilinear group model. Our work is the first MIFE scheme for a non-trivial functionality based on standard cryptographic assumptions, and the first to achieve polynomial security loss for a super-constant number of slots under falsifiable assumptions. Previous works required stronger non-standard assumptions such as indistinguishability obfuscation or multilinear maps. The construction in Chapter 4 improves upon [AGRW17] by handling corruption of input slots without additional efficiency costs or extra assumptions.

- **Chapter 5**: We present MIFE schemes for the inner-product functionality that improve upon those in Chapter 4 in two main directions. First, we introduce a novel methodology to convert single-input functional encryption for inner products into multi-input schemes for the same functionality. This transformation is simple, general, and efficient, and does not require pairings. It can be instantiated with all known single-input schemes, leading to two main advances: (1) expanding the set of assumptions this primitive can be based on, including DDH, LWE, and Decisional Composite Residuosity, and (2) achieving the first MIFE schemes from standard assumptions where decryption is efficient even for messages of super-polynomial size. This work appeared in [ACF+18]. Like the pairing-based MIFE in Chapter 4, the novelty of the work in Chapter 5 is that its security handles corruptions of input slots.

- **Chapter 6**: We turn our attention to multi-client functional encryption (MCFE) for inner products, which enhances MIFE by limiting the leakage of information from encrypted messages. In MCFE, the encryption algorithm takes an additional label (e.g., a time-stamp), and ciphertexts from different input slots can only be combined if they are encrypted under the same label. We present the first MCFE for inner products from standard assumptions, specifically bilinear groups. We first give a simple construction based on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption in the random oracle model, which satisfies a somewhat weak security model. This construction appeared in [CDG+18a]. We then provide several transformations to strengthen security, using a new primitive called Secret Sharing Encapsulation and an extra layer of single-input functional encryption. The resulting scheme is fully secure and relies on bilinear groups in the random oracle model. We also show a generic way to decentralize the generation of functional decryption keys and the setup of the scheme, allowing these processes to be performed independently by all users without interaction. This eliminates the need for a trusted authority holding a master secret key. These transformations appeared in [CDG+18b].

- **Chapter 7**: We present the first functional encryption scheme that supports the evaluation of degree-2 polynomials on encrypted data, based on standard assumptions. This work appeared in [BCFG17]. The ciphertexts are succinct, with their size depending linearly on the encrypted message, not the functions for which functional decryption keys are generated. This is the most advanced functional encryption beyond predicate encryption for constant-degree polynomials from standard assumptions. Recall that in [LT17], it was shown that succinct functional encryption supporting the evaluation of degree-3 polynomials on encrypted data implies indistinguishability obfuscation (together with the existence of block-wise 3-local PRG), a powerful tool with many applications in cryptography. Unfortunately, there is no known construction of such functional encryption (with unbounded collusion) from standard assumptions.

#### Open Problems

- **Tight Security**: Can we exhibit tight security reductions for more advanced encryption schemes, such as attribute-based encryption or functional encryption? Although tightly-secure IBE schemes are known [CW13, HKS15, AHY15a, GCD+16], these schemes either have a large public key (containing Ω(λ) group elements, where λ is the security parameter) or rely on composite-order pairings [CGW17], which are less efficient than their prime-order counterparts. Current techniques, such as adaptive partitioning from [Hof17], have so far been unsuccessful at providing a tightly-secure IBE with compact ciphertexts and public key in the prime-order setting.

- **Bridging the Gap Between Attacks and Proofs**: Bridging the gap between known attacks against cryptographic schemes and their security proofs is a fruitful research agenda. Finding tighter security reductions is one way to bridge this gap by ruling out more attacks than traditional, asymptotic security reductions. Another approach involves finding explicit attacks against particular cryptosystems that match the security proof as closely as possible. To our knowledge, there are no known attacks against concrete public-key encryption schemes that exploit the fact that the security reduction is not tight. This deserves further investigation.

- **Functional Encryption with Large Messages**: Building functional encryption that supports the evaluation of degree-2 polynomials on encrypted data with large messages is an open problem. Current constructions [BCFG17, DGP18] rely on pairings, which only allow decryption to recover the value in the exponent of a group element. Since correctness involves solving a discrete logarithm in this group, the message size must be bounded by a polynomial in the security parameter. Functional encryption with large messages would likely require radically new techniques and avoid the use of pairings, making it highly insightful.

- **Larger Classes of Functions**: Exploring larger classes of functions from standard assumptions, particularly getting degree-3 succinct functional encryption from standard assumptions (and thereby, indistinguishability obfuscation, given the result of [LT17]), would be a breakthrough.

- **Decentralized Functional Encryption**: Mitigating the reliance on trusted third parties (which hold a master secret key) would increase the practical relevance of functional encryption. Decentralized multi-client functional encryption moves in this direction. We hope this work will inspire further research following the same approach for other classes of functions or predicate encryption.
