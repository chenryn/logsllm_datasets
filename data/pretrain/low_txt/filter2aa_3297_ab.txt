### Data Analysis

- **Slide Number:** 30 / 40

**Disclaimer:**
- We are not here to doxx people.
- All people names and domain names in the following examples have been modified.

**Some Statistics:**
- **Most Webmasters’ Real Addresses:**
  - @gmail.com
  - Guessing name from email: about 50%
  - Name couldn’t be found on the website: about 66%
  - Email wouldn’t otherwise appear in a Google search: about 45%
  - Identify business connections/conflict of interest/fake competitors: about 23%

**Homework:**
- How many of these email addresses have an entry in haveibeenpwned.com?

### Ethical Considerations

**Can We Use This Power for "Good"?**
- Try doxxing scam (and adult) websites!
  - Don’t tell my wife
  - Fail: their email doesn’t disclose their names
  - (but we still have the emails, who’s the scammer and who’s the scammee now!)

**Anything... Serious?**
- Some famous peoples’ emails (mentioned on Wikipedia)
- A few personal emails of activists
- On a lighter note, a lawyer website with a redirect to PI:EMAIL
- ~50 redirects for noreply@. Really?

### Manual Analysis

**Caveat! Manual Analysis:**
- We manually went through hundreds of websites, fishing for names and emails:
  - Contact pages
  - Googling names and email addresses
  - Dealing with obscene stuff such as Adobe Flash websites
  - ...
- This is all ‘best-effort’: aka we might have missed public data.

### Disclosure with OVHcloud

- **Slide Number:** 36 / 40

- We called the hotline; they said "send a mail to abuse@"
- First email, including technical details: no reply
- Call the hotline again to confirm the process, which they do
- Second email: no reply
- Get someone working there to ping the right person and forward...
- We’re still waiting for a response :)

### Fixing DNSSEC

- **Slide Number:** 37 / 40

**Fixing DNSSEC:**
- Use public-key cryptography (“DNSSEC white lies”, RFC 4470, 4471)
- Either NSEC5? (2014)
  - Initial draft had issues, met with skepticism, not final, not standardized...
  - Latency...
  - Bad track record for the NSEC family
- Or NSEC3 with digital signatures?
  - Today most DNS servers would use Algorithm13 i.e. ECDSA because of fast signing and wide support
  - Verification is slow... so there’s a burden on resolvers
  - Also requires proper management of keys and algorithms...
  - Experience shows that DNS servers are bad at it
  - [Reference](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1000.pdf)

**Fixing My Redirections:**
- If you are an OVHCloud customer and use their redirections, how do you protect yourself?
  - Protecting the target email is quite easy
  - Protecting the domain email list is more difficult...

- Do not store private info in your DNS Zone
- DNSSEC NSEC3 attacks are practical
- Push for NSEC5 or ECDSA-alg13 adoption!
