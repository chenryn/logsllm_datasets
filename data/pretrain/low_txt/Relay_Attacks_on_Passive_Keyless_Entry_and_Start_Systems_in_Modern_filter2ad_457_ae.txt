### User Authentication and Car Unlocking Process

When the user approaches the car, a secure distance bounding protocol is initiated between the key and the car. If the key is verified to be within 2 meters, the car will unlock, allowing the user to enter. To start the car, the system verifies that the key is inside the vehicle. This verification can be achieved using a verifiable multilateration protocol, as proposed in [11]. This protocol enables the car to securely compute the location of the trusted key. For this process, at least three verifying nodes must be placed within the car, forming a verification triangle. The location of the key can then be securely computed within this triangle.

### Related Work

#### Low-Tech Attacks on Car Entry Systems
Low-tech attacks, such as lock-picking or using hooks, can be used to open a car. A hook is inserted between the window and the door, and the thief attempts to open the door by manipulating the lock button or command. However, these methods are less effective on modern car systems, especially when an alarm system is present. Additionally, lock-picking often leaves traces that can be analyzed by forensic investigators [15].

#### Cryptographic Attacks
Significant research has been conducted on the cryptographic algorithms used in remote key entry systems like Keeloq [26, 34, 13] and TI DST [8]. Common vulnerabilities include short keys, weak encryption algorithms, and side-channel weaknesses. Manufacturers are increasingly adopting more secure and well-established ciphers, such as AES [30]. However, even the most advanced ciphers do not protect against physical-layer relay attacks, which do not require data interpretation or manipulation.

#### Jamming and Replay Attacks
A common attack on keyless car entry systems involves using a radio jammer. When the user steps away from the car and presses the key fob to lock it, a jammer can block the signal, leaving the car unlocked. If the owner does not notice, a thief can easily access the vehicle. While a jammer cannot help start the car, another related attack involves eavesdropping on the key fob's message and replaying it (e.g., using a fake reader/key pair). Standard cryptographic protocols with counters or challenge-response mechanisms can defend against such replay attacks.

#### Part Providers
Major electronic part suppliers provide components for Passive Keyless Entry and Start (PKES) systems [30, 45, 33, 31]. These components are used by various car manufacturers, though there are variations in the protocols and cryptographic blocks (e.g., Keeloq in [31], TI DST in [45], and AES in [30]). All manufacturers use combined LF/UHF radio technology, making their systems susceptible to the same types of attacks.

#### Attacks on Keyless Systems
The closest work to our investigation is found in [6, 7], where the authors analyze the security of keyless car entry systems, including relay attacks. Their analysis identifies the relay problem but proposes a setup with two separate UHF relay links, which can create a feedback loop. We demonstrate that such a complex setup is unnecessary in modern PKES systems and show this experimentally. The authors also do not provide hardware design, practical implementation, or adequate countermeasures.

Recent reports have highlighted practical attacks on PKES systems [4], but detailed information is lacking, making it difficult to understand the specifics of the attack. It is unclear whether the attack relies on modulation/demodulation relay or a physical-layer relay attack, and the reported claims cannot be verified.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we highlight the security concerns associated with PKES systems in modern cars. We demonstrated that 10 cars from different manufacturers are vulnerable to relay attacks, which allow an attacker to open the car and start the engine by placing one antenna near the key holder and another near the car. Our attack was feasible using both wired and wireless setups. While our findings apply to specific PKES systems, the general nature of the relay attack suggests that similar systems may also be vulnerable.

We analyzed critical time characteristics to better quantify system behavior and proposed simple countermeasures that can be immediately implemented by car owners. However, these countermeasures also disable the operation of the PKES systems. Finally, we discussed recent solutions that aim to preserve the convenience of PKES systems while enhancing security.
