# What is Ransomware?
*Ransomware* is a type of cyberattack that encrypts or destroys files and folders, preventing the device owner from accessing their data. Cybercriminals then demand a ransom in exchange for the decryption key. However, even if the ransom is paid, there is no guarantee that the cybercriminals will provide the key to restore access.

> ***Need to start right now?*** See [Protect Your Organization Against Ransomware and Extortion](protect-against-ransomware.md) to quickly configure your IT infrastructure for the best ransomware protection.

## Automated Ransomware Attacks
Commodity ransomware attacks are typically automated. These attacks can spread like a virus, often through email phishing and malware delivery. One effective prevention technique is to safeguard your email system using tools like *Microsoft Defender for Office 365* or *Microsoft Defender XDR* to detect and mitigate malware and phishing attempts early.

## Human-Operated Ransomware Attacks
*Human-operated ransomware* involves an active, targeted attack by cybercriminals who infiltrate an organization's on-premises or cloud IT infrastructure. They elevate their privileges and deploy ransomware to critical data. These "hands-on-keyboard" attacks target the entire organization rather than individual devices. The attackers use their knowledge of common system and security misconfigurations to navigate the network and adapt to its weaknesses.

Key characteristics of human-operated ransomware attacks include:
- **Credential theft** and **lateral movement** with privilege escalation.
- Activities often occur during maintenance windows, exploiting security configuration gaps.
- The goal is to deploy a ransomware payload to high-impact business resources.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These attacks can be catastrophic to business operations and are difficult to clean up, requiring complete adversary eviction to protect against future attacks. Unlike commodity ransomware, which usually only requires malware remediation, human-operated ransomware continues to threaten business operations after the initial encounter.

The graphic below illustrates the growing impact and likelihood of human-operated ransomware attacks.

## Ransomware Protection for Your Organization
For a comprehensive guide on ransomware and extortion, refer to the **[Human-Operated Ransomware Mitigation Project Plan](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/5/1/751682ca-5aae-405b-afa0-e4832138e436/RansomwareRecommendations.pptx)** PowerPoint presentation. Here is a summary of the guidance:

- **High Stakes:** Ransomware and extortion-based attacks have severe consequences.
- **Exploitable Weaknesses:** These attacks have vulnerabilities that can be mitigated to reduce the risk.
- **Three Phases of Protection:**
  1. **Prepare for Recovery:** Ensure your organization can recover from an attack without paying the ransom.
  2. **Limit Damage:** Protect privileged roles to minimize the scope of damage from a ransomware attack.
  3. **Reduce Access:** Make it harder for attackers to enter your environment by incrementally removing risks.

For detailed steps on configuring your IT infrastructure, see the [Protect Your Organization Against Ransomware and Extortion](protect-against-ransomware.md) solution.
