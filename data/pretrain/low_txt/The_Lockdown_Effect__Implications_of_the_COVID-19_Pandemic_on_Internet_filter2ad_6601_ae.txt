### Advances in Network Automation and Deployment

Advancements in network automation and deployment, such as automated configuration management and the use of robots to install cross-connects at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) without human intervention, have enabled networks to handle increased demand. For instance, DE-CIX Dubai rapidly enabled new ports within a week for Microsoft, which was selected as the country’s remote teaching solution for high schools [21]. In summary, our study demonstrates that over-provisioning, effective network management, and automation are crucial for maintaining resilient networks capable of sustaining drastic and unexpected shifts in demand, such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Taming the Traffic Increase

In this paper, we report an increase in traffic of 15-20% within days after the lockdown began. This aligns with reports from ISPs, CDNs [18, 36, 42, 43], and IXPs [56]. Typically, ISPs and CDNs plan for a traffic increase of 30% over a single year [7, 14, 39]. However, the pandemic caused substantial shifts within just a few days. As a result, ISPs either had to rely on over-provisioned capacity—designed to handle unexpected traffic spikes such as attacks or flash-crowd events—or quickly add additional capacity. We observed port capacity increases of approximately 1,500 Gbps (3%) across many IXP members at the IXP-CE alone (see Section 3.1).

Beyond our datasets, some networks publicly reported that traffic shifts due to the pandemic resulted in partial connectivity issues and required new interconnections [22, 57]. When examining traffic peaks, we find that the increase is even smaller. Traffic engineering focuses on peak traffic because it requires more network resources. The pandemic filled the valleys during working hours and led to a moderate increase in peak traffic, which well-provisioned networks can handle, as they are prepared for sudden surges of up to 30% or more due to attacks, flash-crowds, and link failures that shift traffic to other links.

In March, network operators raised concerns about potential network instabilities due to traffic shifts [61]. While we found no evidence that the pandemic's traffic shifts impacted the operation of our vantage points, individual links experienced significant increases in traffic—far beyond the overall 15-20%. Such increases were unexpected for some network operators and may necessitate port upgrades. However, the vantage points in this study range from extremely large to moderately sized networks with sufficient resources and extensive experience in network provisioning and resilience. Smaller networks with limited resources may not be able to plan with adequate spare capacities and fast enough reaction times to compensate for such sudden changes in demand.

### Substantial Shift in Traffic Patterns

From a network operator's perspective, coping with the pandemic required some port capacity upgrades but did not significantly impact operations. The ability of network operators to quickly add capacity when needed highlights that the Internet infrastructure generally works well, despite some challenges in accessing data centers due to the lockdown. From the perspective of traffic mix, the pandemic resulted in substantial changes, including shifted diurnal patterns and traffic composition. Our observations suggest that the Internet core handled these changes surprisingly well, likely because many operators are prepared and can react quickly to new demands. While the pandemic represents an extreme and exceptional case, it underscores that user behavior can change rapidly, and network operators must be prepared for sudden demand changes.

### Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic, a once-in-a-lifetime event, drastically altered working and social habits for billions of people. Yet, life continued thanks to increased digitization and the resilience of our societies, with the Internet playing a critical support role for businesses, education, entertainment, and social interactions. In this paper, we analyzed network flow data from multiple vantage points, including a large academic network, a large ISP at the edge, and three IXPs located in Europe and the US. Together, these provide a comprehensive understanding of the lockdown's effect on Internet traffic in more developed countries.

Our study reveals the importance of using different lenses to fully understand the pandemic's impact on traffic: mornings and late evening hours saw more traffic, workday traffic patterns changed rapidly, and the relative difference to weekend patterns diminished. Applications for remote working and education, including VPN and video conferencing, experienced traffic increases of over 200%. For other parts of the Internet, such as educational networks serving university campuses, we observed decreasing traffic demands due to the absence of users, but a drastic increase in certain applications enabling remote working and lecturing. For some networks, traffic ratios, including sources and destinations, were radically different from pre-pandemic scenarios. These observations highlight the importance of approaching traffic engineering with a focus that looks beyond hypergiant traffic and popular traffic classes to consider "essential" applications for remote working.

With the evidence provided in this paper, we conclude that the Internet, from the perspective of our vantage points, coped well with unseen and rapid traffic shifts. Related work, however, reported performance degradation in less developed regions [3]. The unseen traffic shifts we observed due to confinement measures underscore the importance of the Internet's distributed nature in reacting amicably to such events and enhancing society's resilience.
