### 5.7 Costs

The FPGA design for both the verifier and prover, as shown in Figure 5, consumes 37 flip-flops and 93 lookup tables (LUTs). These LUTs are allocated as follows: 64 for logic, 13 for routing, and 16 as shift registers (each consisting of 4 cascaded 16-bit LUTs). This design is highly compact, utilizing less than 0.5% of the available resources on our FPGA.

Estimating the cost of an ASIC implementation based on these figures is challenging due to the lack of a reliable conversion method between FPGA resource utilization and ASIC transistor count. Additionally, the cost in currency varies significantly with factors such as time, production volume, and fabrication process. Therefore, we will describe the cost relative to the current resource usage.

We have made every effort to minimize the circuitry added to the smartcard while being more liberal with the terminal. For the smartcard, new commands for initiating the initialization phase and two shift registers with a state machine for rapid bit-exchange are required. Given that smartcards already have several thousand memory cells, this addition is minor, especially considering they operate at low frequencies (1–5 MHz). The existing DES engine can be used for the response register content, and the card’s transaction counter can serve as the nonce, \(N_p\).

For terminals, the internal operating frequency is unknown, but it is unlikely to be high enough for good distance resolution. Thus, a capable processor and additional components, such as a high-quality oscillator, are necessary. Alternatively, delay lines can be used for very short distances instead of relying on clock edges. The distance bounding circuitry, including two shift registers and more complex control code, would need to be integrated into the terminal's main processor.

In terms of hardware, the added cost is minimal. However, the added time per transaction, communication with the bank, and the potential for refused transactions and re-issuing cards may result in substantial costs. Only the banks have the necessary information to estimate these overheads accurately.

### 6 Discussion

The proposed distance bounding protocol effectively detects relay attacks but requires banks to produce compliant cards and terminals. However, the cardholder, Alice, has no trusted user interface and cannot protect herself. As mentioned in Section 4.2, this incentive mismatch may compromise the cardholder's security. Until all terminals support the protocol, issuers can choose to fall back to the current, vulnerable protocol. Under UK practice, customers are liable for PIN-verified fraudulent transactions [10], so issuers may accept fallback transactions, shifting the risk to the cardholder.

Another issue with the distance bounding protocol is the lack of non-repudiation. A third party must trust the merchant's terminal to correctly report the round-trip latency. If a customer claims a transaction is fraudulent, even if the protocol succeeded, there is a possibility that the terminal was tampered with. The acquirer must mandate tamper-resistant terminals, but the customer is only indirectly represented by the issuer.

While strong technical solutions like distance bounding exist, they must be deployed within an appropriate liability framework to fully realize their benefits. The current situation, where customers are liable for fraud but powerless to verify terminal authenticity, is unfair. If banking institutions are unwilling to change the entrenched notion of customer liability, more expensive measures, such as the electronic attorney [2], may be necessary. However, customers should be cautious, as the ability to detect attacks could make them reasonably liable for any fraud that still occurs.

### 7 Conclusion

This paper discussed relay attacks and their application to exploit smartcard-based payment systems. We built a prototype that successfully attacked the Chip & PIN system in the UK. We suggested procedural improvements for short-term defense, but these can be circumvented by a determined attacker. We then developed the first implementation of a distance bounding defense, demonstrating its robustness. Our design is tailored for adoption in the next generation of smartcards within the EMV framework.

Future work may include implementing a wireless variant of the protocol, mutual distance bound establishment, and customizing the system for other applications.
