**Abstract:**
Much research has focused on the passwords chosen by English-speaking users, but only a few studies have examined the password selection practices of non-English speakers. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis of 73.1 million real-world Chinese web passwords, comparing them with 33.2 million English-language counterparts. We highlight several interesting structural and semantic characteristics of Chinese passwords. We further evaluate the security of these passwords using two state-of-the-art cracking techniques. Our results reveal a bifacial security nature in Chinese passwords: they are weaker against online guessing attacks (when the allowed guess number is small, e.g., 1 to 10,000) compared to English passwords. However, for the remaining uncracked passwords, they are stronger against offline guessing attacks (when the guess number is large, e.g., >100,000) than their English counterparts. This finding reconciles conflicting claims about the strength of Chinese passwords made by Bonneau (IEEE S&P’12) and Li et al. (Usenix Security’14 and IEEE TIFS’16). At 10 million guesses, our improved PCFG-based attack successfully cracks 33.2% to 49.8% of the Chinese datasets, indicating that our attack can crack 92% to 188% more passwords than current state-of-the-art methods. We also discuss the implications of our findings for password policies, strength meters, and cracking techniques.

**1. Introduction:**
Textual passwords remain the dominant form of access control in almost every web service today. Despite the early revelation of their security pitfalls over four decades ago [39], and the subsequent proposal of various alternative authentication methods (e.g., graphical passwords and multi-factor authentication), passwords continue to be widely used. One reason for this is that passwords offer significant advantages such as low deployment costs, easy recovery, and remarkable simplicity, which are not always provided by other authentication methods [6]. Additionally, there is a lack of effective tools to quantify the less obvious costs associated with replacing passwords [8], as the marginal gains often do not justify the significant transition costs. Furthermore, users themselves favor passwords. A recent survey of 1,119 US users [49] showed that 58% of participants prefer passwords as their online login credentials, while only 16% prefer biometrics and 10% prefer other methods. Thus, it is likely that passwords will persist in the foreseeable future.

Despite their ubiquity, password authentication faces a well-known challenge: truly random passwords are difficult for users to remember, while easy-to-remember passwords tend to be highly predictable. To address this "security-usability" dilemma, researchers have dedicated considerable effort [12, 17, 36, 46, 47] to two types of studies.
