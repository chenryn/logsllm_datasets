### In-Depth Approach to Addressing Outliers
An in-depth approach is necessary to address the challenge of extreme outliers, which can be effectively captured through manual rules. However, addressing such outliers within the Deep Entity Classification (DEC) framework remains an open question.

### Dependence on Training Data Quality
DEC, like other supervised or semi-supervised machine learning systems, heavily relies on the quality of its training data labels. Adversaries who manage to induce inaccurate human labeling at scale could manipulate or interfere with DEC’s classifications. We are continuously working to improve our labeling process to mitigate any observed or potential limitations.

### Performance Evaluation
Despite these limitations, our evaluation using production data at Facebook indicates that DEC outperforms traditional detection approaches. 

### Conclusion
We have introduced Deep Entity Classification (DEC), a machine learning framework designed to detect abusive accounts in Online Social Networks (OSNs). DEC addresses two key issues in existing abuse detection systems:
1. **Deep Feature Extraction**: This method generates features that are powerful for classification and, so far, show no signs of adversarial adaptation typical for account or behavioral features.
2. **Training Framework**: It leverages both high-quantity, low-precision and low-quantity, high-precision training data to enhance model performance.

Our evaluation on production data at Facebook shows that DEC outperforms traditional detection methods. Additionally, DEC's performance remains stable over time, indicating robustness against adversarial adaptation. Over more than two years of deployment at Facebook, DEC has detected hundreds of millions of abusive accounts, contributing to a 27% reduction in the volume of active abusive accounts on the platform.

### Acknowledgements
