**附录A：招募标准**

我们在存储库渠道中的总体招募方法是对GitHub存储库进行分层抽样，这些存储库按“受欢迎程度”和“活跃度”得分排名。我们基于GitHub API提供的存储库级指标（如提交次数和贡献者数量以及星标和分叉数）来计算这一得分。

我们的初始存储库数据集于2021年7月从GH Archive（https://www.gharchive.org/）下载，这是一个提供历史GitHub存储库数据的服务，可供公众进一步分析。我们将数据集限制在至少有20个不同贡献者在过去六个月内提交了至少40次提交的代码存储库中，这为任何选定项目的活动设定了最低门槛。这样做是为了排除不活跃和个人项目，在这些项目中，我们的调查要么无法接触到活跃的贡献者，要么人际信任过程无关紧要。

最终得到的15,256个存储库通过GitHub API获取了最新的数据，包括编程语言使用情况、主题标签以及星标和分叉数。用户通常会给项目添加星标以收藏或明确表示对项目的认可。用户将项目“分叉”到自己的命名空间中，以便能够对其代码库进行修改，并随后创建拉取请求将其更改合并到主源树中。因此，一个项目的星标和分叉数可以作为其受欢迎程度的代理指标。为了确保所选项目最近经历了新贡献者的加入，我们只选择了那些在2021年7月获得了新贡献者的项目，并且这些贡献者之前没有为该项目做出过贡献。在排除重复存储库以及仅包含标记语言的存储库后，我们最终考虑了4,456个项目。

我们将受欢迎程度和活跃度指标结合成一个综合排名，并将项目集分为四分位数。这确保了指标之间的高度多样性，同时最小化了分层的数量。然后，我们迭代地从每个分层中选择并联系项目（例如，第一个分层的第一个项目，第二个分层的第一个项目等），直到达到访谈饱和。

这样处理后，文本更加结构化、条理清晰，并且更符合学术论文的格式。
