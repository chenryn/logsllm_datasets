### Disk Health and Error Attributes

- **Number of Power-Off or Emergency Retract Cycles (ID: 13)**: This attribute tracks the number of times the disk has experienced a sudden power-off or an emergency retraction of the read/write heads.
- **Count of Unrecoverable Errors Using Hardware ECC (ID: 187)**: This metric indicates the number of errors that could not be corrected using the hardware Error Correction Code (ECC).
- **Total Count of Uncorrectable Read/Write Sector Errors (ID: 198)**: This attribute measures the total number of uncorrectable errors encountered when reading or writing to a sector. An increase in this value suggests potential defects on the disk surface or issues with the mechanical subsystem.
- **Count of Unstable Sectors (ID: 197)**: This attribute counts the number of sectors that are waiting to be remapped due to unrecoverable read errors.
- **Count of Reallocated Sectors (ID: 5)**: The raw value represents the count of bad sectors that have been found and remapped. This is a key metric for assessing the life expectancy of the drive.

### Anomaly Detection in Discrete Event Sequences

Algorithms for detecting frequent episodes in event sequences are discussed in [20, 25]. Hubballi et al. [16] apply the concept of n-grams from natural language processing to model patterns in system calls by constructing n-gram trees for short sequences of system calls. These methods share similarities with our approach in terms of using a sliding window to segment discrete events into subsequences. However, these works typically focus on high-cardinality event sequences, whereas our work is constrained to low-cardinality sequences.

Other studies focus on anomaly detection in single discrete categorical event sequences [26]. Dong et al. [12] propose an efficient method for mining emerging patterns in categorical data sequences for trend discovery. A MaxCut-based method [34] is used to detect anomalous events in activity networks. Another technique [11] uses a local anomaly detector to identify individual records with anomalous attribute values and then detects patterns where the number of such records is higher than expected. These techniques, however, do not consider the temporal aspect of events or the inter-dependence among different sources of events or variables. Thus, they cannot provide component-wise knowledge of the underlying system or offer anomaly detection based on a system-wide understanding and modeling.

Multidimensional Hawkes processes [22] and their variants [13, 27] have been applied to model the inter-dependent relationships across multi-source events. Hawkes processes are based on point processes that model the conditions affecting the intensity of arrival events with changing intervals.

### Proposed Methodology

The proposed methodology in this paper is a generic unsupervised learning framework for discrete event sequences collected from sensors. By leveraging language translation, we quantify pairwise relationships among sensors, which are then used to build a multivariate relationship graph. This graph provides valuable system information for knowledge discovery and anomaly detection.

### Conclusion

Modern physical systems use numerous sensors to record the status of different components. Despite a significant portion of these sensors reporting discrete event sequences, there is a lack of effective methodologies designed specifically for such data. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning analytics framework tailored for discrete event sequences collected from sensors in real-world systems. The framework leverages the concept of language translation by considering the discrete event sequences of sensors as their languages and applying Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models to translate the language of one sensor to another. The translation score serves as an effective metric to quantify the pairwise relationships among discrete event sequences, which are challenging to learn using most state-of-the-art algorithms designed for continuous time series. With these pairwise relationships, the analytics framework builds a multivariate relationship graph to represent system information. The proposed framework is validated on two real-world datasets: a proprietary dataset from a physical plant and a public hard disk drive dataset from Backblaze, demonstrating its effectiveness in extracting sensor pairwise relationships for knowledge discovery, anomaly detection, and fault diagnosis.
