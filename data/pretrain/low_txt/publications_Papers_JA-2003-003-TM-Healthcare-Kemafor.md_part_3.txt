#### Tracking Subsystem
The tracking subsystem is designed to remind parents and guardians about upcoming or overdue vaccinations and to inform field workers about children who have not received their immunizations. Additionally, health agencies can use the available data to generate reports for submission to authorities such as the DSS and State Government, and to determine the state's health needs.

- **Link to Contraindication Information** (obtained from the Internet)
- **Clinical Update to "Administer Vaccination"**

#### System Development
The development of the application was completed with constraints based on end-user and system requirements. The key requirements, as determined by CHREF, include:

- **Distributed Client/Server Architecture**: Support for a distributed client/server-based architecture in a heterogeneous computing environment, with transparent distribution for users.
- **Enterprise Coordination**: Support for inter- and intra-enterprise-wide coordination of tasks.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provision of a standard, user-friendly interface for all system users (see Figure 4-5).
- **Task Variety**: Support for a variety of tasks, including transactional, non-transactional, human, and application tasks.
- **DBMS Integration**: Capability to use existing DBMS infrastructure across organizations.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Low cost for system acquisition and deployment for providers and user organizations.
- **Ease of Use and Modification**: Ease of use, modification, scalability, extensibility, and fast design-to-implementation.
- **Standards Compliance**: Use of standards, including EDI, for interactions among autonomous organizations where possible.
- **Security**: Security authorization for users and secure communication (required, as patient data is typically confidential).

**Figure 4-6. Implementation Test-Bed for the Immunization Tracking Application**

Based on these requirements, we created a system test-bed for the application (Figure 4-6). The system includes a heterogeneous and distributed infrastructure with multiple Web servers, CORBA servers, and multiple databases. The workflow involves 13 tasks, including those for the admit clerk, triage nurse, and eligibility check. Autonomous software systems and heterogeneous computer platforms were running in Georgia and Connecticut, using Solaris 2.4, Windows/NT, Windows95, and five databases on two DBMS (Illustra and Oracle).

#### Central Databases
The workflow application system supports the maintenance of several central databases:

- **Master Patient Index (MPI)**: Records personal information and medical history of patients.
- **Master Encounter Index (MEI)**: Records brief information about each patient encounter at any hospital or clinic in the state.
- **Immunization Database (IMM)**: Records information about each immunization performed for a person in the MPI.
- **Eligibility Databases (ELG)**: Provide insurance company’s patient eligibility data.
- **Detailed Encounter Databases (ENC)**: Provide detailed encounter information and relevant data for each patient served by a particular provider.

CHREF manages the MPI, MEI, and IMM centralized databases for the state of Connecticut. The ELG database, containing data provided by insurance companies, is used for EDI-based eligibility verification using the ANSI X12 standard. Web-based access is used to submit eligibility inquiries using ANSI 270, and responses are received using ANSI 271 transactions. Each participating provider organization (hospital or clinic) has its own ENC database. When a structured database is used at CHREF, ODBC-compliant DBMSs (Illustra and Oracle) are promoted.

### Benefits of the METEOR Approach
METEOR offers unique solutions to leverage recent advances in distributed computing infrastructure, middleware, and Web technologies. By quickly integrating applications and information systems to support complex and dynamic business process management, METEOR provides technical advantages that distinguish it from other systems. These distinctions are outlined in Table 5-1 for the applications discussed in Section 4.

|--------------------------|--------------|
| **All Graphical Building of Complex Applications** | Ability to visualize all application components; reduced need for expert developers; rapid deployment. |
| **All Except Clinical Pathways** | Support for heterogeneous, distributed computing environments; open-systems architecture and use of standards; ease of integration of legacy/existing applications; appeal to customers preferring non-proprietary and multi-vendor solutions. |
| **All Automatic Code Generation** | Significantly reduced coding and corresponding savings in development cost; reduced need for expert developers; rapid deployment. |
| **All Integration of Human and Automated Activities** | Natural modeling of complex business activities/processes. |

| **None Dynamic Changes** | Rapidly adapt to changes in business processes. |
| **All Traditional Security** | Support for roles and security on open internetworking. |

| **All Different Levels of Security** | Flexible support for a broad range of security policies. |
| **None Component Repository** | XML-based reusable application components for rapid development of new applications. |

### Conclusion
Based on the deployment of real-world workflows, we have identified a set of requirements for workflow systems supporting healthcare applications. Today’s healthcare processes require capabilities for mission-critical workflow support and enterprise integration. Indispensable features include seamless deployment over networked and heterogeneous server platforms, rapid deployment of applications, ease of integration of legacy/existing applications, high scalability and performance, specification, analysis, and monitoring of quality of service metrics, and adaptation to changes.

While comprehensive solutions encompassing these features are lacking in many current workflow systems, the METEOR system distinguishes itself by focusing on supporting these high-end requirements. The METEOR approach enables rapid design-to-development via automatic code generation. The workflow model and enactment system support a variety of indispensable activities—user and application (automated) tasks—to be used in real-world organizational processes. The workflow engines support heterogeneous and distributed computing environments, allowing workflow process and data to be distributed within and across enterprises. Reliability is an inherent part of the WfMS infrastructure, including support for error handling and recovery by exploiting transaction management features. A well-defined hierarchical error model is used for capturing and defining logical errors, and a recovery framework provides support for the detection and recovery of workflow system components in the event of failure. The system also supports a dynamic change interface, QoS management, and a case-based reasoning subsystem to effectively handle exceptions.
