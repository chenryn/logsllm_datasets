# Impressioning and Lock Picking: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction to Impressioning
- **Why Impressioning?**
  - Impressioning is a technique used to create a working key for a lock without the original key. It involves using a blank key and a series of steps to identify the correct bitting (key cuts) that will open the lock.

- **Impressioning Steps:**
  - **Blank Key to Raise All Stacks:** Start with a blank key and insert it into the lock.
  - **Turn Hard to Bind a Key Pin:** Apply torque to the key to bind the pins.
  - **Binding and Wiggling Causes Rubbing:** The binding and wiggling of the key causes the pins to rub against the blank key, leaving marks.
  - **Observe the Rub Marks:** Remove the key and observe the rub marks.
  - **File Down at the Rub Marks:** File down the areas where the rub marks are present.
  - **Repeat the Process:** Continue the process until the key can turn freely in the lock.

- **Troubleshooting:**
  - **Stack 4 is still Binding/Rubbing:** If stack 4 continues to bind or rub, repeat the filing and observation steps.
  - **Stack 2 is still Binding/Rubbing:** Similarly, if stack 2 is still causing issues, continue the process.

- **Final Steps:**
  - **Continued Rub Marks and Filing:** Continue observing and filing until the key no longer binds.
  - **When the Key is Inserted Now… Pin Stack Number 4 is No Longer Binding:** You will know this has happened when new marks appear.
  - **It’s Delicate & Intricate Work:** This process requires precision and patience. Can you spot the mark here?

- **Success:**
  - **Open!** Once the key turns freely, the lock should open.

## Impressioning Competitions
- **Competitions:** Impressioning competitions are held to test and improve skills in a competitive environment.

## Master-Keyed Systems
- **Master-Keyed Systems:**
  - **Varied Permissions:** Different keys have different levels of access.
  - **Keyway Control:** Some systems have controlled keyways to prevent unauthorized duplication.
  - **Privilege Escalation:** There is a risk of privilege escalation, where a lower-level key can be modified to gain higher-level access.

- **Finding the Master Bitting Depths:**
  - **8 Original Key Cut Depth... Lock Opens:** The lock opens with the original key cut depth.
  - **0 Leave This Position Uncut... Lock Does Not Open:** The lock does not open if the position is left uncut.
  - **2 Cut Down Slightly... Lock Does Not Open:** Cutting down slightly does not open the lock.
  - **4 Cut Down a Little More... Lock Still Does Not Open:** Further cutting down does not open the lock.
  - **6 Cut Down More... Lock Opens!** Cutting down more opens the lock.
