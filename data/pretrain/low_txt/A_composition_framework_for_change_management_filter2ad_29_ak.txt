### Operating Culture and Team Dynamics

The effort to establish a robust operating culture continues into the Executing Process Phase, where the OCM Practitioner monitors team dynamics. Figure 2-7 illustrates the goals of Team Dynamics throughout the Project Management Life Cycle (PMLC).

#### Team Dynamics in the Planning Process Phase

During the Planning Process Phase, Team Dynamics activities focus on building a strong, cohesive working team as new project team members are identified and integrated into team activities. Figure 2-8 outlines the inputs, roles, skills, activities, tools, and outputs for Team Dynamics in this phase.

#### 2.4.1 Inputs

To complete the Team Dynamics activities in the Planning Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner needs a thorough understanding of the following input:

- **Team Guidelines**: Developed by the OCM Practitioner in the Initiating Process Phase, these guidelines outline the expected behaviors and standards for the project team.

#### 2.4.2 Roles

The following table lists the roles and their associated responsibilities for Team Dynamics activities during the Planning Process Phase.

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| OCM Practitioner | Collaborate with the Project Manager to prepare for and conduct the Team Guidelines Session. |
| Project Manager | Collaborate with the OCM Practitioner to prepare for and conduct the Team Guidelines Session. |
| Project Sponsor | Support the Project Manager and OCM Practitioner in addressing team guidelines issues. |
| Project Team | Participate in the Team Guidelines Session. |

#### 2.4.3 Activities

In the Planning Process Phase, the project team begins to formalize and expand. It is crucial that the team works together to increase productivity and create a positive working environment. To support this, the OCM Practitioner and Project Manager will conduct a team meeting to review the team guidelines and use the Team Dynamics Action Log Template to capture and organize tasks, resources, and timeframes for Team Dynamics efforts.

- **Conduct Team Guidelines Session**: 
  - Introduce team guidelines.
  - Reinforce the value of these behaviors from the Project Managerâ€™s perspective.
  - Grant permission to hold other team members, including the Project Manager, accountable for unexpected behaviors.

While this session may seem trivial, it is essential that the Project Manager shows genuine commitment to the team guidelines. A project team is more likely to adopt guidelines if the team leader leads by example and takes a sincere interest in team dynamics. In the Executing Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner and Project Manager will continue to encourage team members to recognize and adopt the team guidelines using surveys and follow-up sessions. If the Planning Process Phase is lengthy, it may be beneficial to begin Team Dynamics activities outlined in the Executing Process Phase earlier than prescribed.

The OCM Practitioner may use the Team Dynamics Action Log to record and track all Team Dynamics activities, such as the Team Guidelines session, throughout the PMLC. This document should be reviewed and modified regularly.

### Training

The goals of the Training Knowledge Area as the project moves through the PMLC are shown in Figure 2-9, with the overall goal of ensuring all users have the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) to utilize the project solution. End user training refers to the training effort needed for all users of a new system, which can include leaders, employees, and external stakeholders.

**Figure 2-9: Training Goals Throughout the PMLC**

#### 2.5.1 Inputs

To complete the Training activities in the Planning Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner needs a thorough understanding of the following inputs:

- **Change Magnitude Assessment**: Provides insight into the relative size of the change, level of readiness for change, and OCM priority areas.
- **Stakeholder Register**: Identifies individuals with a role in the project, providing input for planning Training activities.
- **Project Schedule**: Describes the work to be performed, the resources involved, and the time frames.

#### 2.5.2 Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| OCM Practitioner | Identify the Training method and approach. |
| Project Manager | Provide input into the Training method and approach. |
| Project Sponsor | Provide input into the Training method and approach. |

#### 2.5.3 Activities

End user training is a critical part of a successful IT implementation project. The OCM Practitioner should put sufficient thought and planning into the possible training methods and approaches.

- **Identify Training Method and Approach**:
  - **Train-the-Trainer Training**: Prepares a designated group of instructors to conduct end user training. Useful for large end user populations.
  - **Direct End User Training**: Employs the OCM Practitioner and/or a designated training team to conduct end user training. Suitable for projects with smaller training needs.

Training approaches can include:

- **On-the-Job Training**: One-on-one training for new or less experienced employees.
- **Instructor-Led Training**: Group training with an instructor using lecture and/or lab methods.
- **Web-based Training**: Electronic resources for self-paced learning.
- **Guidebooks/User Manuals**: Written and graphical information available on demand.

Super Users, selected from within the organization, can also support end users by providing accessible and enthusiastic assistance.

The OCM Practitioner should collaborate with the Project Manager to select the most suitable methods and approaches. The results should be documented in the Draft Training Plan, Section 2, Approach.
