## 2.2.3 Discovered Vulnerable Devices

According to [1], several devices are vulnerable to the SNARF attack, including the Ericsson T68/T68i, SonyEricsson R520m, T610, and Z1010, as well as the Nokia 6310/6310i, 8910/8910i, and 7650. Adam Laurie provides information on whether these devices are vulnerable in both visible and invisible modes. However, since this field trial did not use a brute-force approach (as presented by @stake) to detect invisible devices, it only confirms the vulnerability of visible devices. Due to limited market penetration, the vulnerability of some listed devices could not be confirmed.

Figures 2 and 3 show that the top-selling Bluetooth-enabled models from SonyEricsson and Nokia are vulnerable to the SNARF attack.

### SonyEricsson T610
Experiments with the SonyEricsson T610 showed that this model is generally not vulnerable to the SNARF attack. However, during an earlier presentation of the SNARF attack in February, T610 phones with recent firmware versions were found to disclose personal information. This suggests that newer firmware versions may still allow SNARF attacks.

### Nokia 6310/6310i
This study confirms that the Nokia 6310 and 6310i are highly vulnerable to the SNARF attack. Approximately 33% of all discovered devices of this type disclosed personal phone book entries without requiring user interaction. The snarf process takes an average of 30 seconds, indicating that many more devices could have been read out if they had remained in the Bluetooth-covered area longer. Figure 5 shows the ratio of discovered and provenly vulnerable Nokia 6310/6310i devices.

### SonyEricsson T610
Figure 6 displays the ratio of discovered and successfully attacked SonyEricsson T610 devices. As mentioned, the success rate of the SNARF attack will likely increase as more T610 devices update to the newer firmware. In the CeBIT 2004 field trial, only 6% of all discovered T610 devices could be read out.

### Siemens Phones
In the CeBIT field trial, Siemens phones, such as the S55, were not found to be vulnerable to the SNARF attack. These phones request user confirmation for every scan request, which, while secure, can be annoying.

## 2.3 Other Experiences

### Ericsson T68i
The Ericsson T68i, also listed as vulnerable, was tested and confirmed to be vulnerable to the SNARF attack. However, it automatically switches to hidden mode three minutes after Bluetooth activation, making it no longer vulnerable in this state.

## 3 Final Remarks

### 3.1 Proclaimer
All information gathered in this field trial will not be disclosed. Personal information retrieved from vulnerable phones has been deleted. This study was conducted for scientific demonstration purposes only.

### 3.2 What Has Been Done
The SNARF attack at CeBIT was designed to complete as quickly as possible, reading only the first 10 entries of each phone book. About 50 numbers from each snarfed phone were retrieved.

### 3.3 What Could Have Been Done
Several other actions could have been performed with unauthorized Bluetooth access:
- **Sending an SMS:** This method can be used to obtain the victim's phone number, but it incurs costs for the phone owner. It works on Nokia devices.
- **Initiating a Phone Call:** Calls can be initiated to any number, including premium service numbers. However, this abuse is unlikely due to call logs and billing records.
- **Writing a Phone Book Entry:** Entries can be added to the "dialed contacts" list, potentially causing confusion or obfuscation.

### 3.4 Vendor Reaction
Vendors have acknowledged the security loophole but have not taken significant action, stating that it does not seriously damage the phone. Representatives at CeBIT claimed that the issue is fixed in newer firmware versions, though this cannot be confirmed.

## 4 Conclusions
It is concerning that the best-selling Bluetooth phones from SonyEricsson and Nokia are easily readable by attackers. This report aims to highlight this serious security flaw to Bluetooth users, encouraging them to be more cautious.

## 5 Future Work
Ongoing experiments include developing a SNARF application for Java/J2ME phones, which requires the MIDP 2.0 API and the optional Bluetooth API. The Nokia 6600 is currently the only phone with these features.
