#### WS-Agreement Service Properties as Variables
The Linked USDL Agreement description is transformed into a WS-Agreement document, transparently to the user. Our tool also provides the option to explicitly generate the WS-Agreement document in the workspace. Service properties included in service offerings are transformed into properties in the WS-Agreement service description terms, and their concrete values are transformed into creation constraints for those service description terms.

#### Querying SLA Documents
Question answering over SLA documents is supported through SPARQL queries, which can be extended to provide a wide range of analysis operations. In Figure 7, a screenshot shows the execution of a specific competency question operation, where users can view and fine-tune the SPARQL query executed over the document.

#### Validity Checking of SLAs
To check the validity of an SLA, once the WS-Agreement document is generated, the IDEAS WSAG Module engine performs a transformation over a set of constraint models that are fed into a CSP solver (see [14] for details on this module). Specifically, the current tool decomposes document validity into three different analyses:
- **Global Inconsistencies:** This error represents a conflict between two constraints specified in different terms of the document. For example, if one term states that memory should be less than 100, and another states it should be greater than 120.
- **Conditional Inconsistencies:** This is a special kind of inconsistency that depends on a precondition. For instance, if the size is large, the memory should be 10GB, and if the region is eu-central-1, the memory should be less than 5GB. A configuration with both conditions would represent a conditional inconsistency.
- **Dead Terms:** This case represents an inconsistency where a particular agreement term cannot meet the conditions required by another term. For example, if an agreement term states that memory should be greater than 10GB, but another term states that if the memory is less than 5GB, the region should be eu-central-1, the first term becomes a dead term.

#### RDFa Support
Directly using formal languages for modeling concrete SLAs in terms of Linked USDL Agreement requires a level of knowledge and expertise in advanced Information Technologies that is not always available to many users. To bridge this gap, our tool provides a binding mechanism based on the RDFa standard, which allows tying natural language documents to their formal representation in Linked USDL Agreement. RDFa provides a set of markup attributes to attach structured metadata to HTML pages, enabling machines to directly glean and process that information. Based on RDFa Lite, which is a subset of the RDFa standard, IDEAS allows users to bind Linked USDL Agreement definitions to web pages, simplifying the generation of structured descriptions and ensuring consistency between natural language SLA definitions and their machine-processable descriptions.

#### Binding Process
To take advantage of the RDFa support, an initial description of the agreement should be developed in HTML. The binding process comprises three stages:
1. **Selection of Linked USDL Agreement Document:** The user can specify multiple selections and define composed bindings over previous atomic ones.
2. **Selection of Description Fragment:** This fragment will be linked with the formal fragment selected in the previous stage.
3. **Configuration of the Binding:** In this stage, all the different attributes of RDFa Lite can be specified.

Figure 8 shows the final stage of a specific binding where a property is set for the concept `cloud:hasComputingPerformance` to be linked into a span element of the HTML description. The tool also provides features to delete and update different bindings in a document.

If a user opens a document with a description that includes binding information, the tool first shows the natural language description, so the user does not need to understand the underlying Linked USDL Agreement model to start using the document. If necessary, the user can switch to the RDF view in Turtle syntax, and the tool will split the interface to show both the natural language and the Linked USDL Agreement model with the different bindings highlighted. The tool ensures bi-directional binding, enforcing consistency between the two views of the document.

### Future Work
We are currently developing a prototype to support the construction of potential service marketplaces that could provision Linked USDL services in an automated way based on consumer requirements and preferences, addressing heterogeneity and formalizing contracts using Linked USDL Agreement. Additionally, we are integrating our proposal with an SLA monitoring solution to automatically detect violations on service level objectives and notify corresponding customers.
