### Introduction

Medical identity theft is a significant and underreported crime. Due to the difficulty in detecting such fraud, the actual incidence may be far higher than current estimates suggest.

> "Because of the difficulty in detection, the potential exists for this crime to be happening substantially more frequently than anyone has documented to date."

### Hospital Security Vulnerabilities

- **Hospital Penetration Tests:**
  - **Example:** 3.2 million patient records obtained in less than 1 hour.
  - **Analysis:** Discreet analysis at other large hospitals suggests widespread vulnerabilities.
  - **Question:** How do "reasonable measures" compare with discovered vulnerabilities?

- **Unique Aspects of Hospital Networks:**
  - Most areas open to the public 24/7.
  - Security staff are accustomed to random people.
  - Prevalence of guest/patient WiFi networks makes blending in easy.

- **Focus of Research:**
  - Public areas in hospitals.
  - Typical uses of notebook PCs, PDAs, VoIP handsets, and equipment monitoring systems.

- **Security Concerns:**
  - Many systems use embedded Windows or Linux.
  - Providers often cannot apply operating system patches due to software validation issues.
  - Few systems include anti-virus or anti-spyware packages.
  - Most systems are connected to the provider’s production network.
