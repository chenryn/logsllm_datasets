To implement file sharing and access control on a Windows Server, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Shared Folder:**
   - Open "File Explorer."
   - Navigate to the folder you want to share.
   - Right-click the folder and select "Properties."
   - In the Properties window, go to the "Sharing" tab.
   - Click "Share..." to open the File Sharing wizard.

2. **Select Sharing Options:**
   - In the File Sharing wizard, choose the users or groups with whom you want to share the folder.
   - For each user or group, specify the permission level (e.g., Read, Change, Full Control).
   - Click "Share" to apply the settings.
   - Click "Done" to close the wizard.

3. **Configure Share Permissions:**
   - In the folder's Properties window, go to the "Sharing" tab.
   - Click "Permissions" to open the Permissions for [Folder Name] dialog box.
   - Add or modify permissions for the users or groups as needed.
   - Click "Apply" and then "OK" to save the changes.

4. **Configure Security Permissions:**
   - In the folder's Properties window, go to the "Security" tab.
   - Click "Edit" to modify the security settings.
   - Click "Add" to add new users or groups.
   - Enter the names of the users or groups and click "Check Names" to verify.
   - Click "OK" and configure the appropriate permissions (e.g., Full Control, Modify, Read & Execute, List Folder Contents, Read, Write).
   - Click "Apply" and then "OK" to save the changes.

5. **Configure Advanced Security Settings:**
   - In the "Security" tab, click "Advanced."
   - To add or modify advanced permissions, click "Change Permissions."
   - Click "Add" to add a new entry, or select an existing entry and click "Edit."
   - In the Object Properties dialog box, configure the detailed access control list (ACL) for the user or group.
   - Click "Apply" and then "OK" to save the changes.

6. **Test Access:**
   - Use a different computer to test the shared folder's access permissions.
   - Log in with the user account that was granted permissions and attempt to access the shared folder.
   - Verify that the permissions are set as expected.

**Notes:**
- When configuring sharing, it is recommended to use a guest account or a separate dedicated sharing account.
- Be cautious not to over-authorize when setting permissions and security.
- Ensure that the "File and Printer Sharing" service is enabled on the server before starting the configuration process.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up and manage file sharing and access control on your Windows Server.
