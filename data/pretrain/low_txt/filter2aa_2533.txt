# F.O.E. (Feed Over Email): A Proxy-less RSS Reader

## Introduction
F.O.E. (Feed Over Email) is a proxy-less RSS reader designed to help users in censored countries access blocked content. The project is hosted on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/foe-project).

## The Big Challenge
### Facts:
- Many countries censor the Internet, blocking access to "indecent" websites.
- "Indecent" content often includes news sites like Voice of America, CNN, and BBC.

### Problem:
- How to bypass these censorship measures?

## Offending Countries
### Major Censors:
- Belarus, Burma, China, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Zimbabwe

### Minor Censors:
- Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Fiji, Finland, France, Ghana, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Maldives, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Yemen, and USA (surprisingly)

## Censorship Technologies
- **IP Address Filtering**
- **Domain Name Blocking**
- **Packet (Content/URL/Keyword) Filtering**
- **DNS Hijacking**
- **Desktop Monitoring Software** (e.g., Green Dam from China)
- **Combinations and Variations** of the above

## Anti-Censorship Technologies
### Web-Based Proxy Servers
- **Advantages:**
  - Easy to deploy
  - No download required
  - Effective against most common forms of censorship
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Limited multimedia capability (e.g., no videos)
  - Limited interactivity (e.g., no AJAX)
  - Difficult to find new proxy servers
- **Example:**
  - Psiphon, CGIProxy (by James Marshall)

### Client-Side Proxy Software
- **Advantages:**
  - Automatically updates new routes
  - Browser independent
  - Better multimedia and interactivity support
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Difficult to obtain in censored countries
  - May be flagged as Trojans or viruses by anti-virus software
  - Proprietary systems may have privacy and security concerns
  - Connection speed can be slow
- **Examples:**
  - Tor, Freegate, Ultrasurf

### Pure Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
- **Advantages:**
  - Distributed, making it difficult to block
  - Data redundancy across multiple nodes
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Initial node discovery can be challenging
  - Slow speeds, not suitable for web browsing
  - Network reliability and security issues
- **Example:**
  - Freenet

### Email
- **Advantages:**
  - Difficult to block individual emails
  - No known national-level firewall blocks email delivery
  - Can be used to update proxy addresses
  - Emails can be scrambled or encrypted to bypass content filters
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Susceptible to server-side spam filtering
  - Plain-text emails are susceptible to content filtering
  - Encrypted emails require technical skills from recipients
  - Recipients may not know if their emails have been blocked

### Monitoring Software Removal Tools
- **Advantage:**
  - Completely removes desktop monitoring software like Green Dam
- **Disadvantage:**
  - Difficult to obtain the removal software

## FOE: An Anti-Censorship Tool
### Features:
- Built on email
- Allows receiving news, files, and updates
- Works without a proxy

### Problems with Existing Solutions
- **No Proxy, No RSS/Podcast:**
  - Example: China's Great Firewall blocks VOA and RFA feeds
- **Web (CGI) Proxies:**
  - Unreliable due to frequent IP changes
  - Cannot push content to users
  - No good way to inform users of new IPs
- **Proxy Clients (e.g., Freegate):**
  - Expensive to maintain
  - Proprietary
  - No mobile phone support

### How FOE Works
1. **User Request:** Send feeds, please.
2. **Server Response:** Here you go... (RSS, podcast, software, new proxy IP, etc.)
3. **FOE Messages:**
   - Embedded in email messages
   - Compressed to reduce size and bypass content filters
4. **Requirements:**
   - User needs a foreign email account (e.g., Gmail)
5. **Process:**
   - FOE client sends a request to the FOE server via email
   - FOE server sends the requested feed/file to the user’s email
   - FOE client downloads and displays the feed or saves the file

### Advantages
- **User-Friendly:**
  - No need to update IP periodically
- **Portability:**
  - Can be easily ported to mobile phones
- **Push Capability:**
  - Two-way communication
- **Reliability:**
  - US email services are reliable
- **Low Costs:**
  - Built on open standards (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, XML)

### Why FOE?
- **Abundant Foreign Email Servers:**
  - Secured SMTP, POP3, IMAP
  - Reliable and inexpensive (e.g., Gmail)
  - Difficult to block

### Sample Usages
- News feeds (RSS)
- Podcasting
- File downloads
- Distribute proxy IP
- Get user feedback
- Important announcements (push)

### Can It Be Blocked?
- **Yes, when:**
  - Email server is blocked
  - Email account is closed
  - Email provider turns malicious

### What FOE Is and Isn’t
- **FOE is:**
  - A tool for receiving news feeds, podcasts, files, programs, and proxy updates
  - A complement to existing anti-censorship solutions
- **FOE is not:**
  - A universal proxy solution
  - Suitable for real-time applications
  - For downloading large files

### Supported Platforms
- **PCs:**
  - Currently supports Microsoft Windows
  - Potential support for Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, etc.
- **Mobile Phones:**
  - Can be easily ported to most mobile platforms

### How to Improve FOE?
- **Run on other protocols (e.g., Jabber) instead of SMTP?**
- **Create a client-side plug-in architecture?**
- **Create an architecture to allow anyone to set up a FOE server?**
- **Port FOE to other operating systems?**
- **Create FOE clients for mobile devices?**

## Demo
- **Showtime:**
  - A live demonstration of FOE in action

## Conclusion
- **FOE is one of many tools that help fight Internet censorship.**
- **How You Can Help:**
