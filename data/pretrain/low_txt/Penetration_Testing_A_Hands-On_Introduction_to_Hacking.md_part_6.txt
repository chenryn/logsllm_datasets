### Figure 1-15: Android Virtual Device Manager

#### Chapter 1: Setting Up Your Virtual Lab

We will create three Android emulators based on Android 4.3, 2.2, and 2.1, as shown in Figure 1-16. Use the values provided in the figure for each emulator, but set the "Target" to the specific Android version you want to build (Google API versions of Android 4.3 [API level 18], 2.2 [API level 8], and 2.1 [API level 7]). Provide a descriptive name in the "AVD Name" field. Allocate a small SD card size (100MB should be sufficient) to allow file downloads to your Android emulators. Set the "Device" to Nexus 4 and the "Skin" to "Skin with dynamic hardware controls." Leave the remaining options at their default settings.

**Figure 1-16: Creating an Android Emulator**

Once all three emulators are created, your AVD Manager should resemble Figure 1-17 (device names may vary).

**Figure 1-17: Android Emulators Created in Android Virtual Device Manager**

To start an emulator, select it and click "Start," then "Launch" in the pop-up, as shown in Figure 1-18.

**Figure 1-18: Launching an Android Emulator**

The emulator may take a few minutes to boot up for the first time. Once it does, you should have an environment that closely resembles a real Android device. The Android 4.3 emulator is shown in Figure 1-19.

**Figure 1-19: Android 4.3 Emulator**

**Note:** To run the Android emulators in Kali, you may need to increase the performance of your virtual machine by allocating more RAM and CPU cores. I was able to run all three emulators with 3GB of RAM and two CPU cores allocated to Kali. You can make these changes in the virtual machine settings in your VMware product. The amount of resources you can allocate to Kali depends on the available resources on your host machine. Alternatively, you can install Android and the emulators on your host system or another system on the local network. The exercises in Chapter 20 will work as long as the emulators can communicate with Kali.

### Smartphone Pentest Framework

Next, download and install the Smartphone Pentest Framework (SPF), which we will use for mobile attacks. Use `git` to download the source code. Navigate to the downloaded `Smartphone-Pentest-Framework` directory as shown below:

```bash
root@kali:~# git clone -b SPFBook https://github.com/georgiaw/Smartphone-Pentest-Framework.git
root@kali:~# cd Smartphone-Pentest-Framework
```

Open the `kaliinstall` file in the `nano` text editor. The first few lines are shown in Listing 1-5. Note the lines that refer to `/root/adt-bundle-linux-x86-20131030/sdk/tools/android`. If the name of your ADT bundle folder is different (due to a subsequent version release), update this value to match the correct location where you installed the Android ADT in the previous section.

**Listing 1-5: Installing Smartphone Pentest Framework**

```bash
root@kali:~/Smartphone-Pentest-Framework# nano kaliinstall
#!/bin/sh
## Install needed packages
echo -e "$(tput setaf 1)\nInstallin serialport, dbdpg, and expect for perl\n"; echo "$(tput sgr0)"
echo -e "$(tput setaf 1)#########################################\n"; echo "$(tput sgr0)"
echo $cwd;
#apt-get -y install libexpect-perl libdbd-pg-perl libdevice-serialport-perl;
apt-get install ant
/root/adt-bundle-linux-x86-20131030/sdk/tools/android update sdk --no-ui --filter android-4 -a
/root/adt-bundle-linux-x86-20131030/sdk/tools/android update sdk --no-ui --filter addon-google_apis-google-4 -a
/root/adt-bundle-linux-x86-20131030/sdk/tools/android update sdk --no-ui --filter android-14 -a
/root/adt-bundle-linux-x86-20131030/sdk/tools/android update sdk --no-ui --filter addon-google_apis-google-14 -a
--snip--
```

Run the `kaliinstall` script as shown below:

```bash
root@kali:~/Smartphone-Pentest-Framework# ./kaliinstall
```

This will set up the SPF, which we will use in Chapter 20.

Finally, make one more change to the configuration file for SPF. Change directories to `Smartphone-Pentest-Framework/frameworkconsole` and open the `config` file in `nano`. Look for the option `#LOCATION OF ANDROID SDK`. If your ADT bundle folder name has changed since the version current at the time of this writing, update it accordingly in the line that begins with `ANDROIDSDK=`.

```bash
root@kali:~/Smartphone-Pentest-Framework# cd frameworkconsole/
root@kali:~/Smartphone-Pentest-Framework/frameworkconsole# nano config
--snip--
#LOCATION OF ANDROID SDK
ANDROIDSDK = /root/adt-bundle-linux-x86-20131030/sdk
--snip--
```

### Target Virtual Machines

We will use three custom-built target machines to simulate vulnerabilities often found in client environments: Ubuntu 8.10, Windows XP SP3, and Windows 7 SP1.

You can find a link to a torrent containing the Ubuntu virtual machine at http://www.nostarch.com/pentesting/. The target system is compressed using 7-Zip, and the password for the archive is `1stPentestBook?!`. You can use 7-Zip programs to open the archives for all platforms. For Windows and Linux, visit http://www.7-zip.org/download.html; for Mac OS, use Ez7z at http://ez7z.en.softonic.com/mac/. The archive is ready for use once unzipped.

### Setting Up the Windows Virtual Machines

To set up the Windows virtual machines, you will need to install and configure Windows XP SP3 and 32-bit Windows 7 SP1. Sources for the installation media include TechNet and MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network), among others. (You should be able to use your Windows virtual machines on a trial basis for 30 days without a license key.)

#### Creating the Windows XP Target

Your Windows XP target should be a base installation of Windows XP SP3 with no additional security updates. (For more information about finding a copy of Windows XP, visit my website at http://www.bulbsecurity.com/.)

Once you have a copy of Windows XP SP3, follow these steps to install it on Microsoft Windows or Mac OS.

**VMware Player on Microsoft Windows**

1. Choose "Create A New Virtual Machine" in VMware Player and point the New Virtual Machine Wizard to the Windows XP installation disk or ISO image. Depending on your source, you may be offered the option to use Easy Install (if you’re installing a version with a license key), or you may see a warning, "Could not detect which operating system is in this disc image. You will need to specify which operating system will be installed." In the latter case, just press Next.
2. In the "Select a Guest Operating System" dialog, select "Microsoft Windows" in the "Guest operating system" section and your version of Windows XP in the drop-down box, as shown in Figure 1-20, and press Next.

**Figure 1-20: Selecting Your Version of Windows XP**

3. In the next dialog, enter "Bookxp XP SP3" as the name of your virtual machine and press Next.
4. In the "Specify Disk Capacity" dialog, accept the recommended hard disk size for your virtual machine (40GB) and check the box for "Store virtual disk as a single file," as shown in Figure 1-21, and press Next.

**Figure 1-21: Specifying the Disk Capacity**

**Note:** The virtual machine will not take up the entire 40GB; it will only use space on your hard drive as needed. This is just a maximum value.

5. In the "Ready to Create Virtual Machine" dialog, shown in Figure 1-22, click "Customize Hardware."

**Figure 1-22: Customizing Your Hardware**

6. In the "Hardware" dialog, choose "Network Adapter," and in the "Network Connection" field, select "Bridged: Connected directly to the physical network." Next, click "Configure Adapters" and select the adapter you’re using to connect to the Internet, as shown in Figure 1-23. Then press OK, Close, and Finish.

**Figure 1-23: Configuring Your Network Adapter as Bridged**

You should now be able to play your Windows XP virtual machine. Continue to the instructions for installing and activating Windows XP in “Installing and Activating Windows” on page 32.

**VMware Fusion on Mac OS**

In VMware Fusion, go to File > New > Import from disk or image and point it to the Windows XP installation disk or image, as shown in Figure 1-24.

Follow the prompts to create a fresh installation of Windows XP SP3.

**Figure 1-24: Creating a New Virtual Machine**

### Installing and Activating Windows

As part of the installation process, you will be prompted for a Windows license key. If you have one, enter it here. If not, you should be able to use the virtual machine on a trial basis for 30 days. To continue without entering a license key, click Next when prompted for the key. A pop-up will warn you that entering a license key is recommended and ask if you would like to enter one now, as shown in Figure 1-25. Just click No.

**Figure 1-25: License Key Dialog**

When prompted, set the "Computer name" to `Bookxp` and the "Administrator password" to `password`, as shown in Figure 1-26.

**Figure 1-26: Setting the Computer Name and Administrator Password**

You can leave the date/time and TCP/IP settings at their defaults when prompted. Likewise, leave the Windows XP target as part of the `WORKGROUP` instead of joining it to a domain, as shown in Figure 1-27.

**Figure 1-27: Workgroup Settings**

Tell Windows not to automatically install security updates, as shown in Figure 1-28. This step is important because some of the exploits we will run rely on missing Windows patches.

**Figure 1-28: Turning Off Automatic Security Updates**

You will then be prompted to activate Windows. If you entered a license key, go ahead and activate it. Otherwise, you can choose "No, remind me every few days," as shown in Figure 1-29.

**Figure 1-29: Activating Windows**

Now create user accounts `georgia` and `secret`, as shown in Figure 1-30. We will create passwords for these users after setup is finished.

**Figure 1-30: Adding Users**

When Windows starts up, log in as the user `georgia` with no password.

### Installing VMware Tools

Now install VMware Tools, which will make it easier to use your virtual machine by, for example, allowing you to copy/paste and drag programs onto the virtual machine from the host system.

**VMware Player on Microsoft Windows**

In VMware Player, install VMware Tools from Player > Manage > Install VMware Tools, as shown in Figure 1-31. The VMware Tools installer should automatically run in Windows XP.

**Figure 1-31: Installing VMware Tools in VMware Player**

**VMware Fusion on Mac OS**

Install VMware Tools from Virtual Machines > Install VMware Tools, as shown in Figure 1-32. The VMware Tools installer should automatically run in Windows XP.

**Figure 1-32: Installing VMware Tools in VMware Fusion**

### Turning Off Windows Firewall

Now open the Control Panel from the Windows Start menu. Click Security Center > Windows Firewall to turn off the Windows Firewall, as shown in Figure 1-33.

**Figure 1-33: Turning Off the Windows Firewall**

### Setting User Passwords

Again in the Control Panel, go to User Accounts. Click the user `georgia` and then select "Create a password." Set `georgia`'s password to `password`, as shown in Figure 1-34. Do the same thing for the user `secret`, but set `secret`'s password to `Password123`.

**Figure 1-34: Setting a User Password**

### Setting a Static IP Address

Next, set a static IP address so your networking information won’t change as you work through the book. But first, we need to determine the address of our default gateway.

Ensure that your Windows XP system is set to use bridged networking in VMware. By default, your virtual machine will automatically pull an IP address using DHCP.

To find the default gateway, open a Windows command prompt by going to Start > Run, entering `cmd`, and clicking OK. In the command prompt, enter `ipconfig`. This will show you the networking information, including the default gateway.

```cmd
C:\Documents and Settings\georgia>ipconfig
Windows IP Configuration
Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection:
   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . : XXXXXXXX
   IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.20.10
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.20.1
C:\Documents and Settings\georgia>
```

In my case, the IP address is `192.168.20.10`, the subnet mask is `255.255.255.0`, and the default gateway is `192.168.20.1`.

1. In the Control Panel, go to Network and Internet Connections and click Network Connections at the bottom of the screen.
2. Right-click Local Area Connection and then select Properties.
3. Highlight Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and select Properties. Now enter a static IP address and set the Subnet mask and Default gateway to match the data you found with the `ipconfig` command, as shown in Figure 1-35. Set the Preferred DNS server to your default gateway as well.

**Figure 1-35: Setting a Static IP Address**

Now it’s time to see if our virtual machines can communicate. Once you’re sure that the settings match, return to the Kali virtual machine (start it if you had shut it down) and enter `ping 192.168.20.10`, as shown below.

**Note:** My IP address is `192.168.20.10`. Throughout the book, you should replace this value with the IP address of your systems.

```bash
root@kali:~# ping 192.168.20.10
PING 192.168.20.10 (192.168.20.10) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.20.10: icmp_req=1 ttl=128 time=3.06 ms
^C
```

Enter `Ctrl+C` to stop the ping command. If you see output beginning with `64 bytes from`, as shown previously, your virtual machines are able to communicate. Congratulations! You’ve set up a network of virtual machines.

If instead you see a message including the text "Destination Host Unreachable," troubleshoot your networking: Make sure your virtual machines are on the same bridged virtual network, check that your default gateway is correct, and so on.

### Making XP Act Like It’s a Member of a Windows Domain

Finally, we need to modify a setting in Windows XP so that it will behave as if it were a member of a Windows domain, as many of your clients will be. I’m not having you set up an entire Windows domain here, but during post-exploitation, a couple of exercises will simulate a domain environment.

Return to your XP virtual machine and follow these steps:

1. Select Start > Run and enter `secpol.msc` to open the Local Security Settings panel.
2. Expand Local Policies on the left and double-click Security Options on the right.
3. In the Policy list in the pane on the right, double-click "Network access: Sharing and security model for local accounts" and choose "Classic - local users authenticate as themselves" from the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 1-36.

**Figure 1-36: Changing a Local Security Setting to Make Your Target Act Like a Member of a Windows Domain**

4. Click Apply and then OK.
5. Close any open windows in your virtual machine.

### Installing Vulnerable Software

In this section, we will install some vulnerable software on our Windows XP virtual machine. We will be attacking this software in later chapters. Open your Windows XP virtual machine and, while still logged in as user `georgia`, proceed with the installation.
