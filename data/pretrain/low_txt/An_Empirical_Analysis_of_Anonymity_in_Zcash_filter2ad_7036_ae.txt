# Table 6: Number of Clusters Depositing Required Amounts (±1 ZEC) into the Shielded Pool

## 8.2 Results

Our results, in terms of the number of transactions matching our requirements up until January 17, 2018, are summarized in Table 6. Before the first TSB blog post in May, we found only a single matching transaction, which is very likely a false positive. This indicates that the types of transactions we were seeking were not common before TSB began using Zcash.

After the blog post, we flagged five clusters in May and June for the requested amount of 100 ZEC. Only two clusters were flagged for 500 ZEC, one of which was from August. No transactions of any of the required quantities were flagged in September, despite TSB switching to accepting only Zcash in September. This could be due to several reasons: our criteria may have caused us to miss transactions, or there may have been no takers. From October onwards, we flagged between 1-6 transactions per month. It is difficult to determine if these represent users paying for old data dumps or are simply false positives.

Out of the 24 transactions listed in Table 6, four are highly likely to be false positives:
1. A deposit of 100 ZEC into the pool in January, before TSB announced their first blog post. This cluster also deposited an additional 252 ZEC into the pool in March, suggesting it was just a regular user.
2. Two deposits of 200 ZEC into the pool in June, before TSB announced that one of the July dump prices would cost 200 ZEC.
3. A deposit of 400 ZEC into the pool in June, before TSB announced that one of the July dump prices would cost 400 ZEC.

Among the remaining clusters, one is particularly noteworthy. This cluster made deposits into the pool in June for 100 ZEC, in July for 200 ZEC, and in August for 500 ZEC, exactly matching TSB's prices. The cluster belonged to a new user, and most of the funds in this user’s cluster came directly from Bitfinex (Cluster 3).

## 9 Conclusions

This paper provides the first in-depth exploration of Zcash, with a particular focus on its anonymity guarantees. To achieve this, we applied both well-known clustering heuristics developed for Bitcoin and attribution heuristics we developed specifically for Zcash, taking into account its shielded pool and unique features. As with previous empirical analyses of other cryptocurrencies, our study shows that most users are not utilizing Zcash's main privacy feature. Furthermore, the participants who do engage with the shielded pool often do so in an identifiable manner, which significantly erodes the anonymity of other users by shrinking the overall anonymity set.

### Future Work

Our study was an initial exploration, leaving many avenues open for further research. For example, it may be possible to classify more z-to-z transactions by analyzing the time intervals between transactions in more detail or by examining other metadata such as the miner's fee or the size (in bytes) of the transaction. Additionally, the behavior of mining pools could be further identified through active interaction studies.

### Suggestions for Improvement

Our heuristics would have been significantly less effective if the founders interacting with the pool behaved in a less regular fashion. By always withdrawing the same amount at the same intervals, it became possible to distinguish founders' withdrawals from other users. Given that the founders are both highly invested in the currency and knowledgeable about secure usage, they are in the best position to ensure the anonymity set is large.

Ultimately, the only way for Zcash to truly ensure the size of its anonymity set is to require all transactions to take place within the shielded pool or to significantly expand its usage. This may soon be computationally feasible given emerging advances in underlying cryptographic techniques [6], or if more mainstream wallet providers like Jaxx roll out support for z-addresses. More broadly, it is an interesting regulatory question whether mainstream exchanges would continue to transact with Zcash if it switched to supporting only z-addresses.
