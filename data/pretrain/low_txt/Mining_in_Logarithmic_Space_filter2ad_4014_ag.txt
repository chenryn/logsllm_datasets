### Optimized Text

Our protocol is online, succinct, and secure against all minority (1/3) adversaries. These characteristics are essential prerequisites for achieving the desired goal of logarithmic-space mining. Our probabilistic analysis techniques can also be leveraged to significantly simplify the previous analyses of the above protocols.

#### Proof of Stake
Our protocol is specifically designed for Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains and does not readily adapt to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) setting. The probabilistic nature of ùëÑ-blocks and predictable stochastic processes are inherent by-products of the mining process and the random oracle model. Simple modifications, such as allowing block producers to annotate their blocks with an appropriate level and sign it, are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. If we instead rely on a stochastic property of blocks, the adversary can perform grinding attacks, investing computational work while honest parties only put in stake, thereby gaining an advantage. In PoS settings, only stake majority assumptions are made, and it remains an open question whether the consensus data of stake-based blockchains can be compressed.

### Appendix

#### Mathematical Background

**Theorem A.1 (Chernoff Bounds)**: Suppose \(\{X_i : i \in [n]\}\) are mutually independent Boolean random variables, with \(Pr[X_i = 1] = p\), for all \(i \in [n]\). Let \(X = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i\) and \(\mu = pn\). Then, for any \(\delta \in (0, 1]\),
\[ Pr[X \leq (1 - \delta)\mu] \leq e^{-\delta^2 \mu / 2} \]
and
\[ Pr[X \geq (1 + \delta)\mu] \leq e^{-\delta^2 \mu / 3}. \]

**Lemma A.2**: For each \(j \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(F_j\) and \(M_j\) be Boolean random variables such that \(E[M_j] = \zeta\) and \(M_j\) is independent of \(F_i\) for \(i \leq j\) and independent of \(M_i\) for \(i \neq j\). For any \(\epsilon \in (0, 1)\),
\[ Pr\left[\sum_{j} F_j M_j \geq k \right] \leq e^{-\Omega(\epsilon^2 k)}, \]
by the union bound.

**Proof**: Since
\[ \sum_{j} F_j M_j > (1 + \epsilon)\zeta, \]
it suffices to show that
\[ Pr\left[\sum_{j} F_j M_j = k \right] \leq e^{-\Omega(\epsilon^2 k)}. \]

In the summations below, let \(\alpha\) range over words in \(\{0, 1\}^*\) and \(\beta\) be any word in \(\{0, 1\}^\ell\) of weight \(k\). For a fixed \(\alpha\), define \(J_\alpha = \{ j \in \mathbb{N} : F_j = 1\}\) and \(B = (M_j)_{j \in J_\alpha}\). Also, for \(j \in \mathbb{N}\), let \(E_j\) denote the event \(\{(\forall i < j)(F_i = \alpha_i \text{ and } i \in J \Rightarrow M_i = \beta_i)\}\). Then,
\[ Pr[B = \beta] = \sum_{\alpha} Pr[B = \beta, A = \alpha] = \prod_{j \in J} Pr[F_j = \alpha_j | E_j] Pr[M_j = \beta_j | E_j, F_j = \alpha_j] \]
\[ = \prod_{j \in J} Pr[M_j = \beta_j] Pr[A = \alpha | B = \beta] \cdot \zeta^k (1 - \zeta)^{\ell - k} \leq \zeta^k (1 - \zeta)^{\ell - k}. \]

Thus, letting \(\beta\) range over all words in \(\{0, 1\}^*\) of length less than \(k(1 + \epsilon)\zeta\) and weight \(k\) ending with 1, the left-hand side of (6) is equal to
\[ \sum_{\beta} Pr[B = \beta] \leq \sum_{k \leq \ell < k(1 + \epsilon)\zeta} \binom{\ell - 1}{k - 1} \zeta^k (1 - \zeta)^{\ell - k}. \]

That is, the probability is at most that of a random variable following a negative binomial distribution with parameters \(k\) (the number of successes) and \(\zeta\) (the probability of success) being less than \(k(1 + \epsilon)\zeta\). The bound follows from standard Chernoff bounds.
\[ \blacksquare \]
