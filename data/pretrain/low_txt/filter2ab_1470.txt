**ATT&CK ID:** M1024  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Restrict Registry Permissions

To enhance security, it is essential to set appropriate permissions for the Windows Registry hives. This measure prevents unauthorized users from modifying keys associated with System Integrity Protection (SIP) and trust provider components. If these Registry keys are not adequately protected, malicious actors may hijack these components, redirecting them to execute functions already present on the disk. Properly restricting Registry permissions can mitigate this risk.
