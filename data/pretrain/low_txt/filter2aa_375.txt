**About Us:**
FreeCulture.org is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting and facilitating student involvement in the free culture movement. Founded in April 2004 at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, our mission is to support the establishment of student groups at colleges and universities across the United States and beyond. Today, Free Culture groups are active at nine colleges, with more emerging globally.

**Our History:**
The organization was founded by two Swarthmore students who, in 2003, sued voting-machine manufacturer Diebold for abusing copyright law. The name "FreeCulture.org" is inspired by the book *Free Culture* by Stanford University professor Lawrence Lessig. Our movement has deep roots in the free software community, free speech advocacy, civil liberties, media activism, and other related fields.

**Our Structure:**
FreeCulture.org is non-partisan and run entirely by volunteer efforts from students. Each campus group operates autonomously and focuses on a wide range of interests. We have collaborated with various organizations, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Public Knowledge, Creative Commons, and Downhill Battle.
