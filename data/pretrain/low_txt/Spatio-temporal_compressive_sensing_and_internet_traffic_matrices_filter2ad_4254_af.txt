### Techniques and Simulation

We do not claim that our simulation is entirely realistic; rather, it effectively illustrates the properties of various anomaly detection techniques. The simulation consists of two steps: first, we generate normal traffic, and then we inject anomalies. We create the Traffic Matrix (TM) by orthogonally combining a synthetic gravity model TM [22] in the spatial domain with a periodic Norros model [18, 23] in the temporal domain. Both models have their advantages, but primarily, we need to create a TM with low rank and some local spatio-temporal structure, similar to what might be found in real TMs.

### Data Generation and Anomaly Injection

We use this model to generate 1,000 instances of the TM \( X \), each consisting of one week's worth of measurements at 15-minute intervals. In each instance, we inject a single anomaly. The anomaly is a spike added to the TM at a randomly chosen time point, ensuring that one anomaly does not interfere with the detection of another. The spike is a vector of Gaussian random variables, normalized to a fixed size, which we vary from 0.1 to 100. Spikes of size 0.1 are nearly indistinguishable from standard random variations in the traffic, while spikes of size 100 are much larger and easily observable. We then apply each of the three techniques to create a "normal" traffic vector and detect anomalies by thresholding on the differences between the normal and measured vectors.

### Handling Missing Data and Anomalies

It is important to note that our input data does not contain missing values, as it is unclear how to fairly compare the three algorithms in such cases, given the superior interpolation performance of SRMF. However, the anomalies are included in the inputs, allowing for a fair comparison between SVD and SRMF.

### Threshold Selection for Outlier Detection

A critical aspect is the choice of thresholds for outlier detection. The non-stationarity of our data makes setting these thresholds more challenging than in some other problems. For small anomalies, fine-tuning allows us to find threshold values that are statistically indistinguishable for all three methods. Figure 8 shows a comparison of false-alarm probabilities for the three techniques, including 95% confidence intervals for the estimates. For larger anomalies, it is difficult to tune the false-alarm probabilities for PCA/SVD because the anomaly contaminates the data used to create the normal subspace, invalidating the standard statistical assumptions used to determine thresholds [21]. This makes it hard to obtain thresholds that produce the same false-alarm probabilities for large anomalies, but the differences in these cases are inconsequential for the results. Similarly, it is challenging to tune the false-alarm rate for SRMF and large anomalies, but for the opposite reason: the false-alarm rate drops almost to zero too quickly. Given the high detection rate, this is not a problem in the comparison of results.

### Detection Probabilities

Figure 9 shows the detection probabilities for the three techniques. For small anomalies, the differences they create are also small, leading to a low probability of detection. Even though we allow a larger false-alarm probability as the anomalies get smaller, the detection probability for Differencing drops dramatically. On the other hand, PCA/SVD exploits the spatial relationships between the data elements, using all the information available at a particular time point instead of processing each time sequence independently. While the performance of PCA/SVD also declines for smaller anomalies, it is much better than Differencing. For moderate-sized anomalies, both techniques have perfect detection records. However, for large anomalies, the detection probability of PCA/SVD drops dramatically due to the contamination of the data used to create the normal subspace. Differencing, in contrast, maintains its perfect detection record. SRMF, which uses a spatio-temporal model, provides a method that deals well with the complete range of anomalies. Its detection probability is statistically indistinguishable from the better of the two other methods for each anomaly size, and its false alarm probability is either indistinguishable or well below that of the other two methods.

### Advantages of SRMF

SRMF achieves this through its use of a spatio-temporal model. When the spatial model is more effective (for small anomalies), this part of the algorithm is most active. For large anomalies, they are detected in the temporal domain, essentially by differencing. By imposing a temporal smoothness constraint on LRT, the effect of contamination is much smaller. If too much energy leaks into the normal subspace (as in PCA), the projection of \( X \) into the normal subspace is no longer smooth, resulting in a large penalty in the smoothness term. Thus, the smoothness term helps limit the damage of contamination and avoids the problem seen in PCA/SVD.

### Generalization and Future Work

While we do not argue that with the naive choices of temporal operator \( T \) that we use here, SRMF is the best prediction or anomaly technique for TMs, there is a lesson to be learned. Our regularization approach can be generalized to apply to any linear prediction/anomaly detection technique through appropriate choice of \( T \). In each case, we would hope for performance improvements. More importantly, our approach naturally deals with missing data, flexibly includes additional data sources (e.g., link data), and anomaly detection (and exclusion) are inherent parts of the algorithm. These are ideal features for any set of algorithms based on TMs.

### Conclusions and Future Work

By drawing on recent developments in compressive sensing and leveraging readily available domain knowledge in the area of TMs, we present a unified approach to measurement and analysis of TMs. We achieve this by developing a novel spatio-temporal compressive sensing framework that exploits both global and local structures in real-world TMs. Whether applied to TM estimation, prediction, or anomaly detection, our algorithms consistently outperform other commonly-used methods across a wide range of missing values scenarios. The main reason for the superior performance of our proposed technique is its reliance on truly spatio-temporal models of TMs that capture much of the localized structure inherent in actual TMs.

There are several avenues for future work. First, we plan to better tailor our approach to exploit the characteristics of real-world TMs through more detailed modeling of the spatial and temporal constraint matrices \( S \) and \( T \). Second, many of the techniques described here, including SRMF, naturally extend to tensors, allowing the original (unvectorized) TMs to be analyzed directly as true 3D objects. Third, we want to more thoroughly explore the application of our approach to enable scalable network measurement and support important network engineering tasks such as anomaly detection. Finally, we aim to formally understand the theoretical properties of our spatio-temporal compressive sensing framework.
