### Mr. Knudsen's Project: Streamlining Business Registration in Denmark

Mr. Sune Knudsen's project addressed a specific government requirement: the selection of a branch code, which is the statistical industry category to which a newly registered business will belong. However, the Database Administrator (DBA) knew that many business owners become frustrated and spend an inordinate amount of time figuring out which code to choose. For them, selecting a code is not just a matter of statistical categorization; it is a decision about their business's public identity. Approximately one-fourth of all new businesses in Denmark end up registering a code that does not accurately reflect their business activities. This leads to errors in government systems, as agencies such as the Food Safety Administration, the Ministry of Taxation, and the Work Safety Agency use these codes to plan and execute controls, including on-site visits. The knock-on effects on administrative waste and error are significant.

To address this issue, Sune Knudsen engaged designers to use a range of ethnographic techniques to study how business owners experienced the online registration process and how various public agencies internally managed and collaborated around the branch codes. Based on insights into user experiences both outside and inside the system, designers then carried out iterative prototyping of web mock-ups, testing them with end-users. The team, consisting of public servants from Mr. Knudsen's staff, a digital design agency, and the innovation unit MindLab, created a working model for a new website to handle branch code registration. They also developed a knowledge management system for administrative staff to ensure quick knowledge-sharing across different public agencies.

### 6.2. Public Value by Design

Sune Knudsen's comments highlight a pattern observed in several instances of empirical research: design-led approaches, when implemented, have the potential to significantly improve public value. According to Cole and Parston, "public value" is increased when public service organizations can improve efficiency (productivity) while also improving outcomes. In my own work, I argue that, in addition to productivity and outcomes, the value of innovation in the public sector should include user (citizen) satisfaction and democratic elements such as participation, empowerment, transparency, and accountability. In fact, engaging citizens can, in itself, lead to increased value. As Pestoff points out, governments can seek better ways to involve citizens in the provision (co-production) of goods and services, either to improve the efficiency of public services, the effectiveness of public policies, or to promote other important social goals, such as citizen empowerment, participation, and democracy.

What kinds of public value are potentially improved by design approaches? Taking a closer look at Sune Knudsen's quote, he expects his design project to make branch code registration easier and more satisfactory for business owners, ensure better outcomes in the form of more accurate registration (compliance) with the codes, and reduce the time public administrators spend answering questions about the codes. Additionally, he anticipates fewer errors in planning and executing controls. An externally produced business case study confirmed that these types of value could be expected, estimating that the cost of the new web-based solution would deliver a return on investment (ROI) of approximately one to twenty over three years.

### Case Study: Camillagaarden

In the case of Camillagaarden, an institution for adults with mental disabilities, manager Christina Pawsø noted an actualized gain in productivity resulting from changes in the relationship with citizens. The institution added thirty percent more users while maintaining the same number of staff and increased satisfaction. She provided an example: on average, there is one social worker to eight users at Camillagaarden. However, with the right type of engagement, two staff members can facilitate thirty users over several hours, effectively doubling productivity. Pawsø explains that this is made possible by leveraging the resources and motivation of individual users: "If you are put into a frame where all your resources are being used instead of focusing on what you are having trouble with, then you can also help others. And this also gives value to the individual."

The British organization, The Innovation Unit, has characterized such results, where services are produced at lower costs while being better for people and driving more positive outcomes, as "radical efficiencies." It seems that co-design helps managers realize exactly such opportunities.

### 7. Conclusion: Discovering Co-Production by Design

In each of the cases discussed in this article, collaborative design processes have triggered new and different approaches by public managers to their organization's service provision. Below, I consider the implications for design practice, education, and public policy.

#### Implications for Design Practice

Design approaches, as applied in the examples given, help public managers explore in detail how the system/user relationship is shaped through interactions in space and time. This holds disruptive potential because public managers are given the opportunity to view the results of their organization's efforts in a new light. A systematic finding across the empirical data—across all sixteen interviews—is that the voice of the citizen, captured through audio or video (preferably live media), is a crucial trigger for change. This can be termed "professional empathy," as qualitative research powers an empathetic, engaging, but still professional, reconnection between public service staff and users. As Anne Lind, Director of the Danish Board of Industrial Injuries (BII), said, "it is an eye-opener."

What is especially eye-opening is how user experiences are tightly connected to the creation of outcomes. In an institution like Camillagaarden, where engagement and thriving are the desired outcomes, positive user experience and a co-productive relationship with staff are key to positive change. Getting businesses to comply with abstract statistical requirements requires the Danish Business Authority to establish an interaction design that makes doing the right thing easy. To help injured workers return to the labor market, the Board of Industrial Injuries must design a meaningful, individualized service process that supports physical and mental healing and identity to the point where they can re-enter the workforce. The implication for design practice is that designers must continue to develop and strengthen their ability to conduct in-depth user research and facilitate processes with clients and stakeholders to activate "professional empathy" and turn eye-openers into real change.

#### Design Education

Design approaches provide a different set of tools and methods for working systematically and collaboratively with innovation in government. Qualitative, ethnographically-inspired research; highly open, interactive, and tangible workshop formats; visualization and rapid prototyping; and user testing redesigned services are novel approaches to policy and service innovation.

Design education needs to support students in learning the theory and practice of collaborative design within a public sector setting. Further, education must equip them with the ability to navigate the internal machinery of government. Even as designers help public managers achieve an outside-in perspective on the consequences of their efforts, designers must also appreciate the inside-out experience of working within a political, hierarchical, and bureaucratic setting. Extended secondments or internships to public service organizations are probably the best way to help design students understand the daily life of a public servant. Additionally, it might make sense to equip design students with a minimum of public management theory, perhaps as electives. One of the biggest barriers for designers to become trusted advisers of governments is that their world or worldview is too far removed from that of policymakers. For future generations of designers to be effective, this needs to change.

#### Policymaking

This article points to three implications for policy:

1. **A New Relationship with Citizens:** This implies a new mode of production that shifts the relationship between the public service system and citizens. The concept points towards a more reciprocal, mutual relationship where professional public staff sees its role as collaborative, and citizens are recognized as co-producers of value.
   
2. **Shift to Outcomes via Citizen-Centered Research:** This shows the consequences for people of an organization's interactions with them. The concept relates to the new system/citizen relationship but takes it a step further through methods that show, often in highly empathetic ways, the impact of a service or process on end-users.

3. **More Public Value:** Both for the system and for users, as a result of systematically redesigning interactions to shape the new relationship.

These findings point to a conclusion: design-led innovation can lead to the discovery and implementation of co-production as a new model for public service organizations. However, this model poses new challenges to existing practices, routines, and cultures:

- **New Professional Identities for Public Service Staff:** How to make the transition from 'helper' to 'facilitator'?
- **Impact on Human Resources:** If co-production leads to a need for fewer human resources in public organizations, would design projects with this focus mean asking staff to make themselves redundant? How can they be expected to engage in making co-production successful?
- **User Willingness to Co-Produce:** Although the findings point to a positive shift in the system/citizen relationship, is there such a thing as too much reciprocity? Will citizens revolt and demand that they just 'receive' service for their tax dollars?

It may be that design has not only helped place co-production back on the public sector reform agenda; it may also trigger a renewed research agenda around these topics.

#### 1. Introduction

The thoughts we present here as our contribution to the Public & Collaborative cluster activities have their most concrete origins in a meta-level initiative we have been running since 2010 at Aalto University in the form of a "special interest group" (SIG). Our CO-P2P SIG was a cross-Aalto activity aimed at understanding the processes, logics, and incentives that make possible novel partnerships between the public sector, private sector, third sector, and citizens to create, produce, and deliver public services. Instead of focusing on a particular design intervention, the participants in the SIG decided to focus their efforts on creating shared vocabulary and analysis of past and ongoing initiatives of the SIG members, as we noticed the need to build common ground and a set of shared premises if we were to continue work further. Thus, through a seminar and case studies, we designed a shared outcome in the form of a book (see Figure 1), much in the same spirit as we are now doing this exercise at the DESIS level.

In this chapter, we want to highlight some of the thoughts and experiences that writing the book brought to us in relation to the aims and questions we have been tackling in the DESIS cluster of Public & Collaborative. We do this here with the aim of bringing the relationship to design activities more to the forefront.

#### 2. Public & Collaborative: A Brief Overview of the Situation in Finland

In Finland, like in other Western countries, the last few years have witnessed a flurry of citizen-driven and organized activities ranging from guerrilla gardening and urban farming aimed at beautifying unattended urban spots, pop-up one-day restaurant initiatives commenting on impractical bureaucracy, Cleaning Day carnivals calling attention to the need for new recycling practices, grassroots urban planning initiatives, and new movements to promote sustainable living.

- **Guerrilla Gardening and Urban Farming:** A successful case is a nationwide network of urban gardening coordinated by Dodo ry, an environmental association (http://www.kaupunkiviljely.fi).
- **Pop-Up One-Day Restaurants:** The Ravintolapäivä (http://www.restaurantday.org/) has turned into an international movement called "Restaurant Day," where everyone can create a restaurant for a day.
