### 2.0.0. Top Pages and Page Sizes

- **Average of 5 pages**
- **Page size (KB):** 0, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500
- **Figure 2:** Average page sizes for the top 60 websites as reported by Alexa.

### Bandwidth Characteristics

- **Asymmetric Connections:** Download bandwidth is greater than upload bandwidth, which is common in most broadband services.
- **Institutional Connections:** Bandwidth is symmetric.
- **Residential Connections:** Assigned to 90% of clients.
- **Capacity Distribution:** Determined by cross-referencing 2011 country of origin data for Tor clients with average upload and download speeds from NetIndex [21].
  - Example: 20% of Tor client connections originate in the United States, so 20% of links are assigned the mean U.S. upload and download speeds for 2011.
  - Both residential and institutional clients receive capacities from this distribution, but institutional clients are assigned symmetric connections using the download speed for both upstream and downstream traffic.

### Types of Tor Users

- **Web Clients:**
  - Periodically request web pages.
  - Page sizes sampled from the distribution of frontpages of the top 60 websites as reported by Alexa [1] (see Figure 2).
  - Requested page sizes: 106KB, 150KB, 238KB, 496KB, and 992KB, each with equal probability.
  - These values represent the 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th, and 90th percentile of web page sizes, respectively.
  - Web clients pause an average of 11 seconds between requests (median "think time" from a study of web browsing behavior [12]).
  - Take 9 to 11-minute breaks after 15 minutes of browsing.

- **Bulk Clients:**
  - Model high-bandwidth users who continually download files.
  - File sizes chosen uniformly at random from 1MB, 2MB, 3MB, 4MB, and 5MB.
  - 3% (30) of clients are bulk clients; the remaining 870 are web clients.

### Physical Emulation Setup

- Ensured no processing or network effects introduced.
- Edge and core machines connected via a dedicated 1Gbps link.
- Total aggregate network throughput did not exceed 1Gbps.
- Experiments not bound by ExperimenTor configuration's bandwidth or CPU resources.

### 5.1 Rate Limit Selection

- The universal rate limit should be sufficiently large to not significantly impact the experience of web users.
- Computed a reasonable minimum rate limit by considering the amount of time users are willing to wait for a web page and the distribution of web page sizes.

### 5.2 Effects of Rate Limiting

- The rate limit should not be so high as to allow high-bandwidth users to consume an unfair share of the network’s resources.
- Universal rate limit should degrade the performance of high-bandwidth users, providing incentives for them to operate their own relays.
- **Figure 2:** Cumulative distribution of web page sizes from the top 60 Alexa [1] websites, including embedded images and JavaScript but excluding Flash and other content not included in Tor-loaded pages.
- Selected rate limits based on the expected load time of current web pages:
  - 200KBps limit covers all pages from the Alexa dataset.
  - 100KBps limit covers approximately 80% of the top 60 Alexa websites.

### 5.3 Performance Improvements

- **Figure 3:** Effects of rate limiting at 100KBps (left) and 200KBps (right) on web and bulk clients, when no clients opt to run relays.
  - Web clients are largely unaffected: even with the 100KBps limit, the mean transfer speed drops only 15%, from 40KBps to 34KBps.
  - Bulk transfer clients are severely affected: even with the 200KBps limit, the mean transfer speed drops 31%, from 70KBps to 49KBps.

- **Computational Overhead:**
  - Tortoise requires additional token buckets for rate limiting, incurring a computational cost.
  - **Figure 4:** CPU utilization of the edge node executing all 960 Tor instances.
  - Median CPU utilization with unmodified Tor: 24.7%; with Tortoise: 26.4%.

- **Benefits of Adding More Relays:**
  - **Figure 6:** Cumulative distribution of client bandwidths with no rate limiting and added relays.
  - In the base case with 15 ORs (1.7% of all nodes), the mean client bandwidth is 41KBps.
  - Scenarios:
    - 10% (2) of bulk transfer clients and 2% (18) of web browsing clients opt to run routers, adding 20 routers.
    - These percentages double, adding 40 routers.
    - Mean bandwidth increases by 27% to 52KBps with 20 additional relays and by 66% to 68KBps with 40 additional relays.

- **Motivation for Clients to Become Relays:**
  - Applying the universal rate limit motivates clients to become relays.
  - Bulk clients see a 31% and 30% decrease in average bandwidth with 200KBps and 100KBps limits, respectively.
  - Web clients incur only 15% and 17% decreases with the two rate limits.
  - Anticipate that at least a small fraction of bulk (and potentially web) clients will also run ORs.

- **Benefits to Clients That Become Relays:**
  - Operating an OR exempts a client from Tortoise’s universal rate limit.
  - **Figure 5:** Clients running ORs experience better bandwidth.
  - Low and high adoption rates correspond to 10% (2%) and 20% (4%) of bulk (web) clients opting to run ORs.
  - Mean bandwidth for all Tor clients who chose to run routers increased by 38% and 78% when 10% and 20% of bulk clients became routers, respectively.

- **Benefits of Adding More Relays with Rate Limiting:**
  - **Figure 7:** Impact of running Tortoise on network performance.
  - Grey line: average bandwidth on a network running unmodified Tor.
  - Solid black line: bandwidth of a network using Tortoise.
  - If no clients opt to run as a relay, adopting a 200KBps or 100KBps rate limit leads to decreased capacity.
  - With 10% of bulk and 2% of web clients (2.22% of all clients) electing to run relays, mean bandwidth increases slightly by 3.1% and 0.7% with 100KBps and 200KBps limits, respectively.
  - Addition of another 20 client relays (4.44% of all clients) provides 36% and 31% greater mean bandwidths under the 100KBps and 200KBps rate limits, respectively, compared to the unmodified network.

- **Handling Increasing Capacity:**
  - Network running Tortoise can handle additional clients better due to freed capacity from rate limiting.
  - **Figure 8:** Change in network capacity when the sizes of both a Tortoise network and an unmodified Tor network are increased by 20%.
  - Average bandwidth decreases from 45KBps to 30KBps (35%) for the unmodified network and from 50KBps to 36KBps (28%) for the Tortoise network with a 100KBps limit.
  - With a 200KBps limit, Tortoise’s average bandwidth is reduced from 57KBps to 40KBps (30%) when extra clients are added.
  - Tortoise-based network better tolerates a sudden and large increase in non-relay clients.

- **Effect of Partial Participation:**
  - Evaluated Tortoise’s efficacy when not all relays apply the universal rate limit.
  - Simulated a Tor network with 50% of relays rate-limiting clients.
  - **Figure 10:** Cumulative distribution of bandwidths with 0, 20, and 40 clients opting to run relays.
  - Performance similar to a network with 100% Tortoise adoption when significant numbers of clients choose to run routers.
  - Less motivation to become a router in a network with 50% Tortoise adoption.

### 5.4 Summary

- Emulation results indicate that Tortoise has the potential to significantly increase Tor’s performance.
- Challenge is selecting a universal rate limit that properly motivates clients to operate as relays.
- Even a few relays improve the network’s overall performance and capacity, even if most clients are subjected to rate limits.
- Mean client bandwidth increased by 6.5% over standard Tor with a 100KBps limit, 50% of relays applying the rate limit, and 2.2% of clients opting to run relays.

### 6. Discussion and Limitations

- **Tortoise’s Relay Exemption Policy:**
  - Currently incompatible with bridges.
  - May cause problems for bridges, which are unlisted Tor relays allowing users to connect in locations where public relays are inaccessible.
  - Bridges may forward traffic from multiple clients, but Tortoise will subject them to the same rate limits.
