### 4.1 ICMP Ping Floods and Handoffs

In the first set of experiments, we used ICMP ping flooding, where Echo Request packets are continuously sent over the wireless link. The pings were transmitted from the wireless client to the access point(s) (APs), traversing the wireless link and returning. To stress-test MultiScan, we conducted an experiment in which 10 handoffs were performed by the MultiScan module within a one-minute period. Figure 3 illustrates the typical round-trip times (RTTs) of the ping packets. The vertical lines in the figure indicate the times when the handoffs were initiated. From the figure, it is evident that the ping traffic experienced no significant increase in latency due to the MultiScan handoffs.

A careful observer may notice that the density of data points in the figure varies depending on the network interface card used. This variation is not an artifact of MultiScan but rather a result of hardware differences (one interface is slightly slower than the other, possibly due to hardware or heat issues).

To further illustrate that the ping traffic experienced no perceptible handoff latency, we provide a close-up view of a representative handoff instant in Figure 4. We then compare the performance of MultiScan handoff with that of a typical single-interface handoff in Figure 5. The figure shows a 640 ms outage period (the x-axis range is the same as in Figure 4). Given the imperceptible change in performance for wireless handoffs using MultiScan, we are confident that MultiScan can efficiently handle any traffic volume on the wireless link.

### 4.2 Skype and Handoffs

The experiments in this section involved transmitting a one-minute audio file of a person talking through Skype. We first established the baseline performance over a wireless link without handoffs and then compared the results with data obtained using MultiScan and single-interface handoffs. We considered two metrics: end-to-end latencies and audio quality. However, the latency data was similar to the data presented in the previous section, which is not surprising since Skype's natural inter-packet latency (15 to 30 ms) is higher than that of ping floods (about 10 ms). Therefore, we will focus only on audio quality.

Informal qualitative analysis revealed that MultiScan handoffs had no perceivable impact on audio quality, while single-card vanilla handoffs resulted in long periods (about half a second) of dead air. To quantify the differences in audio quality, we used cross-correlation of the captured samples. Cross-correlation of two real functions \( f(t) \) and \( g(t) \) is defined as:

\[ f \star g = \int f(\tau) g(t + \tau) d\tau \]

The cross-correlation function captures the similarity between the two signals. In particular, two signals that are similar should have a high cross-correlation near the origin and low cross-correlation elsewhere.

Figures 6 through 8 show the cross-correlation between the original audio signal (at the sender) and the received audio signal across the wireless link. The best case in all experiments reflects the situation where no handoffs are performed, and the audio signal is transmitted uninterrupted over the wireless link. Note that even in the best case, Skype performance is not perfect, just adequate for normal voice communication.

In Figure 6, we show the cross-correlation function for two scenarios: one with 10 MultiScan handoffs over a one-minute interval and another representing the best case. The two plots are virtually indistinguishable from each other. The maxima of the two cross-correlations are 788.3870 and 737.2810 for the best case and MultiScan, respectively. These differences are minor and comparable to the differences between two independent best-case (no handoffs) transmissions. Figure 7 provides a close-up of Figure 6, showing small differences in cross-correlation values and identical-sounding samples.

In contrast, Figure 8 shows the performance difference between the best case (single interface, no handoffs) and a case where the client performed a single one-interface vanilla handoff. The two plots are significantly different, and the loss in audio quality was noticeable to the human ear.

### 5 Related Work

Researchers have used multiple radios to improve performance in various applications. Examples include reducing energy consumption of wireless clients, improving web performance in wide-area (cellular) networks, and constructing wireless mesh networks. Some specific works include Wake-on-Wireless [4], work by Rodriguez et al. [9], and commercial ventures like MeshDynamics. Bahl et al. [6] explicitly advocate multi-radio wireless systems for improved performance.

In this paper, we take another step in advocating multi-radio wireless node design and demonstrate its applicability in WLANs to improve VoIP application performance. To our knowledge, there has been no prior work on eliminating handoff latency in WLANs using multiple radios and demonstrating the advantages of such techniques for VoIP applications.

Prior research has focused on improving handoff performance using a single radio interface. Shin et al. [3] explored techniques to improve handoffs by implementing topology inferencing in both clients and APs. Ramani et al. [2] defined SyncScan, which requires time synchronization between APs and clients. Both schemes aim to reduce the time spent in the channel scanning phase during handoffs. By changing the APs and clients and increasing coordination, Neighbor Graphs achieves handoff latency of about 40 ms, and SyncScan handoffs take 2-3 ms (but require periodic suspension of communication lasting more than 10 ms, depending on hardware).

Unlike these schemes, which optimize performance with a single radio and require coordination and cooperation between APs and clients, MultiScan relies solely on multiple radios in wireless clients to completely eliminate handoff latencies. Our proposed scheme requires no interaction or participation from APs, making it deployable in arbitrary wireless environments, including those where neighboring APs are not administered by a single entity. Such scenarios are becoming common in many major cities in the form of community wireless networks [14]. Table 1 summarizes the differences between the approaches discussed above and MultiScan.

Two other works related to multi-interface nodes are MUP [8], which allows multi-radio wireless nodes in a mesh network to establish two separate wireless links, and Chandra et al. [13], who demonstrated how a node could stay connected to multiple wireless networks simultaneously. In the context of MultiScan, this work applies to the potential functionality of the secondary interface.

### 6 Conclusion

It is not surprising that network nodes with multiple network interfaces can experience better performance than nodes with a single network interface. Many hard-to-overcome limitations of 802.11 wireless networking, coupled with the increasing demand for bandwidth and low latency, make it natural to explore multi-interface options. While adding a radio interface leads to a modest increase in cost, this and other works demonstrate that significant performance improvements can be achieved. Therefore, we reinforce the need for increased availability of multi-radio interfaces in wireless devices.

Overall, we make the following observations and contributions in this work:
- We recommend the use of two radio interfaces to eliminate handoff latencies in WLANs. Using two radio interfaces in wireless devices is already feasible and will become more so with the increased availability of multi-interface and multi-band wireless cards.
- Our multi-radio approach does not use the radios in tandem for data transfer, as ensuing interference between the interfaces themselves (even on independent wireless channels) can lead to degraded performance. Instead, one interface should be used as the primary data interface, while the other serves as a secondary interface, periodically monitoring the environment for handoff opportunities. The functionality of the two interfaces is swapped when necessary.
- Utilization of multiple radios does not create additional load on wireless spectrum resources. At any time, one wireless interface acts as the secondary and does not impose any data load on the wireless medium. This also implies that the proposed mechanism is not hindered as more clients start operating in the multi-radio mode.
- We have developed MultiScan as an open-source Linux module, which will be available for public download from: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~suman/projects/multiscan/.

As a follow-up to this work, we intend to explore how MultiScan should be extended to handle the newly defined Inter Access Point Protocol (IAPP) [12]. IAPP is a new mechanism proposed by the IEEE 802.11f working group to better handle roaming clients (currently, IAPP is not widely implemented or available). IAPP, among other requirements, enforces unique AP association, and hence the timing of AP switch operations currently implemented in MultiScan needs to be appropriately optimized.
