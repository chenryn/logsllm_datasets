### Hand-Off and Follow-Up with Referring Professionals

We conducted a hand-off in which we discussed our findings with the referring professionals. For 12 of these cases, the professional was on-site, and the hand-off occurred immediately. For the remaining 13 cases, we followed up via email and/or phone calls. Although many clients did not resolve the discovered issues immediately due to the need for safety planning, they found it helpful and empowering to understand how the abuser might be obtaining information about them.

### Further Research and Client Requests

In 11 cases, further research was required after the initial consultation. Six of these involved client requests for information about specific apps that we were unfamiliar with (e.g., "Can app X track my location?"). For the remaining five, we identified something during the consultation that needed further analysis to assess its potential danger. In 10 of these cases, the consultant conducted in-depth research and provided a comprehensive answer to the referring professional within a few days. In one case, despite significant research, we could not provide a satisfactory explanation for what the client was describing, which we communicated to the referring professional.

### Discussion

#### Preliminary Results and Future Directions

Although the results from our field study are preliminary, they suggest that our consultation protocol is already valuable to clients in dangerous situations. The ENDGBV has requested that our team schedule more consultations with clients at the FJCs, raising new questions about how to sustain and scale our clinical computer security approach. In this section, we discuss:

1. **Limitations of Our Current Study:**
   - Our study was limited to a single municipality, and participants may not represent all individuals who suffer from IPV. While New York City has a diverse population, our sample included primarily women, most of whom were no longer living with their abusers and had been in heterosexual relationships. This may not capture the nuances of abusive relationships for LGBTQIA+ individuals or those still living with their abusers.
   - The sample size of 44 clients, while sufficient to verify the utility of our consultations, does not provide statistically significant estimates of, for example, the likelihood of spyware or other harms.
   - Our consultations may not catch all issues due to consultant or technical errors. Complex, multifaceted attacks pose a fundamental challenge, and perfection is unattainable. However, our approach significantly improves upon the current status quo, which often lacks any structured intervention.

2. **Open Questions for Clinical Computer Security for IPV:**
   - **Scalability and Sustainability:** A sustainable clinic will likely require an organization to handle recruitment, screening, and training of volunteer or paid consultants. Existing models like pro-bono legal services and student-run clinics may offer viable strategies.
   - **Maintenance of Instruments:** ISDi's coverage relies on labor-intensive updates, and maintaining accuracy over time is challenging. We keep ISDi’s blacklist private to prevent spyware developers from adapting to it. Other instruments, such as the TAQ and manual investigation guides, will also require periodic updates.

3. **Clinical Computer Security Beyond IPV:**
   - Victims of targeted, persistent, and personalized attacks in contexts other than IPV, such as dissidents, activists, and NGO employees, may benefit from clinical approaches to computer security. Adapting our techniques to similar communities, such as victims of elder, parental, or child abuse, or sex trafficking, could be important research directions.
   - Contexts less similar to IPV, such as those targeted by government agencies, might also benefit from systematized clinical approaches. The work of organizations like the Citizen Lab and Citizen Clinic could inform these efforts.

### Conclusion

This paper outlines a vision for clinical computer security and explores its application in the context of IPV. Through an iterative, stakeholder-driven process, we designed a protocol for face-to-face tech consultations with IPV victims to identify and address their tech issues. Our preliminary study with 44 IPV victims revealed vulnerabilities for roughly half of the participants, including account compromise, potential spyware, and misconfiguration of family sharing plans. Our consultations provided advice and information to both victims and professionals on documenting discoveries and improving computer security. This clinical approach offers immediate value and lays the foundation for future research on evidence-based refinements to clinical tech interventions in IPV and beyond.
