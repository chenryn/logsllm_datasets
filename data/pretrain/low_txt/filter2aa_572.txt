## Abstract
From the DEF CON 19 Call for Papers (CFP):

### Overview
This presentation explores the techniques and tools for covert post-exploitation forensics using Metasploit. The goal is to conduct surreptitious acquisition and analysis of data without the subject's knowledge, even in scenarios where the subject's physical location is unknown.

### Key Concepts
- **Covert**: Operations conducted without the subject's knowledge.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Actions taken after a remote compromise or local backdoor has been established.
- **Forensics**: Reconstructing data beyond what the subject anticipates.

### Applications
- **Forensic Examiners**: Tools and methods for acquiring and analyzing data remotely.
- **Penetration Testers**: Enhanced data gathering from compromised systems, including data that may not be readily available or known to the subject.

### Typical Forensics Examination Scenarios
- **Hardware Seizure**
- **Authorized Software Agents**
- **On-Site Analysis**
- **Subject Awareness**: The "suspect" or subject is aware of the examination.

### Covert Remote Forensics
- **Unaware Subject**: The subject is unaware of the forensic activities.
- **No Known Physical Location**: The lack of a known physical location is not a barrier.
- **Remote Imaging**: Techniques for imaging remote systems.
- **Remote Block Device Access**: Accessing and analyzing block devices remotely.

### Benefits
- **Intelligence Gathering**: Enhanced intelligence for various stakeholders.
- **Improved Post-Exploitation**: Penetration testers can gather more valuable data.
- **Compliance and Criminal Investigations**: Support for compliance checks and criminal investigations.

### Educational Aspects
- **Semester-Long Class**: Comprehensive training on these techniques.
- **Week-Long Law Enforcement Courses**: Intensive training for law enforcement personnel.
- **Talks and Workshops**: Engaging with penetration testers and forensic experts.

### File System Forensic Capabilities
- **Allocated Files**: Analysis of active files.
- **Deleted Files**: Recovery and analysis of deleted files.
- **Slack Space**: Examination of unused space within sectors.
- **Disk/Volume**: Full disk or volume analysis.
- **Unallocated Space**: Analysis of free space on the disk.
- **Deletion vs. Formatting vs. Wiping**: Differentiating between types of data removal.
- **Imaging**: Creating byte-for-byte images of the disk.

### Example: Slack Space
- **Sector Size**: 512 bytes
- **Cluster Size**: 4 sectors
- **File Size**: 4150 bytes
- **RAM Slack**: Typically zeroed out.
- **Disk Slack**: Potential source of valuable data.

### Current Limitations
- **Loading Sleuth Kit**: While loading forensic tools like Sleuth Kit onto the target might work, it can:
  - Overwrite deleted files.
  - Lack stealth.
  - Be less efficient than the proposed solution.

### Enter Railgun
- **Remote Windows API Calls**: Using Railgun to call Windows API functions remotely.
- **Direct Access to Block Devices**: Reading arbitrary sectors from the disk.
- **Mapping Remote Block Devices**: Mapping remote block devices to local ones.

### Metasploit Post Modules
- **enum_drives.rb**: Enumerate drives on the target.
- **imager.rb**: Perform byte-for-byte imaging with hashing and split image capabilities.
- **nbd_server.rb**: Map remote block devices to local ones, enabling the use of local forensic tools.

### Architecture
- **Attacker**: Initiates the process.
- **Target**: The compromised system.
- **Meterpreter**: Facilitates communication and control.
- **Windows API**: Accessed via Railgun.
- **Disk**: The storage medium.
- **Metasploit**: Manages the modules.
- **NBD (Network Block Device)**: Maps remote block devices to local ones.
- **Forensic Tools**: Operate on the mapped local block devices.

### Network Considerations
- **Speed**: Network speed impacts the efficiency of data transfer.
- **Stealth**: Minimizing the footprint to avoid detection.
- **Cross-Platform Implementation**: Enhancing compatibility across different platforms.
- **Pure Ruby iSCSI**: Potential for a cross-platform iSCSI implementation.

### Conclusions
- **Enhanced Data Acquisition**: Extract more data from compromised systems.
- **Building Capability**: Strengthen the skills of forensic examiners and penetration testers.
- **Secure Wiping Encouragement**: Promote secure data wiping practices.

### Demos
- Live demonstrations of the techniques and tools discussed.
