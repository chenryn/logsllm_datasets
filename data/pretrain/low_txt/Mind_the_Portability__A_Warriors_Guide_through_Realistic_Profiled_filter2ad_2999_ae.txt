Before directly using the built templates, it is important to consider the portability issue. In 2018, the CHES conference announced a side-channel CTF event for "Deep Learning vs. Classic Profiling," which also addressed the portability challenge. One of the contest categories was protected AES implementation. The winning attack combined a linear classifier (decision tree and perceptron) with a SAT solver. This attack required five traces and 44 hours of SAT solver time to achieve 100% success on different devices, but only one trace was sufficient for attacking the same device [41]. To summarize, all previous works applied target-specific pre-processing or post-processing to address portability.

Recently, two studies have focused on portability. A cross-device side-channel attack was presented in [42], where the authors proposed a neural network architecture optimized for cross-device attacks, highlighting the portability problem. Carbone et al. [43] used deep learning to attack an RSA implementation on an EAL4+ certified target. In both studies, the authors used multiple devices for various stages of a profiled attack (i.e., training, validation, and attack). The classification algorithm (MLP/CNN in their case) was trained with traces from two devices and tested on a third device. Their observations align with our results, indicating that deep learning can help overcome portability when trained with multiple devices. However, their focus was on demonstrating the feasibility of the attack in the presence of portability. In contrast, we study the core problem of portability, identify the limitations of state-of-the-art techniques through extensive practical experiments, and propose a methodology based on MDM. We believe this work will pave the way for realistic studies on SCA.

### Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we address the portability issue in machine learning-based side-channel attacks. We demonstrate how even small differences between devices can significantly impact attack performance. As expected, our results show that the scenario where different keys and devices are used in the profiling and attacking phases is the most challenging. This is important because it indicates that many attacks in related works overestimate their effectiveness by using the same device and key for both training and attack. We identify the validation procedure as a critical pitfall for portability and machine learning. Consequently, we propose the Multiple Device Model (MDM), which reports more than a 10x improvement in attack performance.

In our experiments, we considered homogeneous platforms with no countermeasures, motivated by finding the best-case measurements to focus on portability problems. For future work, we plan to extend this approach to heterogeneous platforms and investigate the influence of various countermeasures (both hiding and masking) on the performance of machine learning classifiers when considering portability. Additionally, we aim to experiment with a larger number of devices to improve the generalization capabilities of machine learning algorithms.

It is not always possible to assume the availability of multiple devices for training under the MDM. In such settings, the adversary would need to resort to simulation. Ideally, simulating multiple devices (or components) can be achieved by running Monte Carlo simulations with available process variation models, a method widely used in VLSI design. This simulation methodology can be extended to the board level, which combines several distinct devices with individual process variation models. Note that the viability and accuracy of this simulation methodology depend on the availability and precision of the process variation model, which is proprietary to the manufacturer and may not be easily accessible. A practical evaluation of the robustness of MDM with this simulation methodology will be an interesting extension of this work.

Finally, our experiments suggest that smaller datasets may be less prone to overfitting. It would be interesting to see whether good performance can be achieved with small training set sizes, conforming to the setting described in [44].
