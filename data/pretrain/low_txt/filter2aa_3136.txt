## Concept Behind Hacker Spaces
- **Definition (hackerfoundation.org)**: Any gathering of hackers as a community to share ideas, collaborate on projects, or simply enjoy each other's company can be considered a hacker space.
- **Types**:
  - Local Gatherings
  - Conventions
  - Hacker Group Living Situations
  - Fixed Hacker Research Spaces

## Examples of Hacker Spaces
- **Chaos Computer Club (CCC)**: Over 2,000 members
- **C-Base**: Approximately 300 members
- **NYC Resistors**: 18 members

## Cost of a Hacker Space
- **C-Base (300 members)**: 
  - **Financial Struggles**: Almost went bankrupt in July
  - **Funding Needed**: Received €20,000 out of the required €30,000 in six weeks
- **NYC Resistors (18 members)**: 
  - **Rent**: Looking at around $2,250 for a place near Lemur
- **Local Rent**: 1,250 sq. ft. at $800 per month

## Ideas for Hacker Spaces

## Advantages of Mobile Hacker Spaces
- **Mobility**:
  - Can be parked anywhere: parks, coffee shops, friends' houses, restaurants
  - Go to where the hacking opportunities are: wardriving, conventions, gatherings
  - Mobile classroom

- **Cost Efficiency**:
  - Initial purchase price + gas + insurance
  - Supports a wide range of people: small groups inside (max 8), large groups outside

- **Modularity**:
  - Equipment can be switched out
  - Interior can be changed based on project needs
  - Storage space for events and long-distance travel

## Disadvantages of Mobile Hacker Spaces
- **Mobility**:
  - High gas costs
  - Insurance costs
  - Wear and tear
  - Theft risk

- **Limited Space**:
  - Cannot expand square footage
  - Electricity limitations:
    - Batteries
    - Limited square footage
    - Expensive/expansive solutions
    - Plugging into the grid limits mobility

- **Environmental Factors**:
  - Varying air circulation
  - Heat from equipment and unwashed bodies
  - Extreme temperatures (e.g., cold in Colorado, hot in Las Vegas)
  - No fun hacking in the rain
