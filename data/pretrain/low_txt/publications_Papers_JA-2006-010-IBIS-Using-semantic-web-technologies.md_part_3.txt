**Figure 13: Instances of the Classes in the Ontology**

#### Request
We are interested in retrieving the name and address information of a person. The correct query to obtain this information is as follows:

The `hasAddress` object property connects the `Person` and `Address` classes. The middleware automatically generates the SQL statement by extracting the mapping information stored in the ontology instances.

```sql
SELECT 
    TablPerson.PersonName AS name,
    TablAddress.Address AS address
FROM 
    TablPerson
LEFT JOIN 
    TablPersonAddress ON TablPerson.IdPerson = TablPersonAddress.IdPerson
LEFT JOIN 
    TablAddress ON TablPersonAddress.IdAddress = TablAddress.IdAddress;
```

#### Response
The returned data, formatted in XML according to the domain layer, would be:

```xml
<Person>
    <name>John Doe</name>
    <address>123 Main Street, Anytown, USA</address>
</Person>
```

The structure of the XML aligns with the ontology structure. This approach was chosen because, in the current application scenario, it is easier for clients (e.g., PHP, Java) to read and manipulate raw XML than an OWL structure.

#### Related Work
Several tools and approaches exist today for integrating heterogeneous data sources. We will briefly describe the Corporate Ontology Grid (COG), Mediator Environment for Multiple Information Systems (MOMIS), OBSERVER, Knowledge Reuse And Fusion/Transformation (KRAFT), and InfoSleuth.

- **InfoSleuth and KRAFT**: These approaches are based on agents. InfoSleuth is a multi-agent system for semantic interoperability in heterogeneous data sources [NFKPTU99]. Agents are used to query and transform data between schemas. Each agent is aware of its own ontology and the mappings between that ontology and the data schema. InfoSleuth uses several shared ontologies, made available through ontology agents.

- **KRAFT Architecture**: Designed to support knowledge fusion from distributed heterogeneous databases and knowledge bases. The basic philosophy of KRAFT is to define a "communication space" where certain communication protocols and languages must be respected [GPFGB97].

- **OBSERVER**: A component-based approach to ontology mapping. It provides brokering capabilities across domain ontologies to enhance distributed ontology querying, avoiding the need for a global schema or collection of concepts. Each component node has an ontology server that provides definitions for the terms in the ontology and retrieves underlying data [MKSI96]. The query language in OBSERVER is specific, and each node must have a one-to-one mapping to all other relevant nodes.

- **COG**: Aims to create a semantic information management system by integrating several heterogeneous data sources into a global virtual view [Bru04]. COG allows the integration of imported RDBMS schema databases, XML Schemas, COBOL copybook, and custom wrappers. The Unicorn Workbench tool accommodates both GAV and LAV approaches [Bru04, BJ04]. Queries cannot be executed in the workbench, and it is not possible to query multiple data sources. Views over the global virtual view must be created in advance to permit access to the data. Queries are similar to SQL, and access to the global virtual view is via a specific API.

- **MOMIS**: Aims to provide a global virtual view of information from heterogeneous data sources [BB04, BBCG04]. MOMIS creates a global mediation schema for structured and semi-structured data sources, providing a uniform query language. It is based on the GAV approach, meaning the global schema is built based on local sources. Queries are expressed using a SQL-like language.

None of the presented solutions use OWL to describe the domain model and store mappings to the databases. Many of these solutions are limited in generating the statements to retrieve data, and some use proprietary query languages.

#### Conclusion
In this paper, we present our solution for creating a middleware to provide integration and abstraction between clients and databases. Our system creates a global virtual view over a set of data sources using OWL ontologies. We use a layered system, allowing for reuse, evolution, and incremental development. The middleware consists of three layers: data source, domain, and interface.

- **Interface Layer**: Provides services and ensures interoperability with other systems/organizations, structuring requests and responses in XML and exposing them as Web Services. A customized request language, expressed in XML, allows users to interact with the system, abstracting from technical details.

- **Domain Layer**: Uses OWL ontologies to describe the domain and integrate several data sources. Mappings to the data sources are stored in the ontology instances. This solution allows us to distribute our ontology among stakeholders without revealing confidential or technical data.

- **Data Source Layer**: Implemented using Hibernate, which allows connection to more than 20 database vendors using JDBC.

We believe our solution will guarantee and improve the integration of heterogeneous data sources by using a semantic abstraction layer described in OWL. It also decouples client applications from database servers, minimizing maintenance.
