**Abstract:**
Despite efforts to replace them, passwords remain the primary form of authentication on the web. Password managers aim to address many of the issues associated with passwords by helping users generate, store, and fill strong and unique passwords. Although experts frequently recommend password managers, there is limited information regarding their usability. To aid in designing such usability studies, we systematize password manager use cases, identifying ten essential use cases, three recommended use cases, and four extended use cases. We also systematize the design paradigms employed to satisfy these use cases, which should be examined in usability studies to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we describe observations from 136 cognitive walkthroughs exploring the identified essential use cases in eight popular password managers. This work is expected to serve as a foundation for new research into the usability of password managers.

## 1. Introduction

Despite ongoing efforts to replace passwords, they remain the primary form of authentication on the web [2]. However, passwords have several limitations: users often create easily guessed passwords [5, 23] and reuse the same password across multiple accounts [4, 10, 20, 33]. Password managers seek to address these problems by helping users generate strong passwords, store those passwords securely, and fill them automatically, ensuring they are only sent to the correct website.

Several studies have examined the usability of password managers [3, 8, 13, 16, 17, 21, 22, 29, 31]. However, these studies do not cover the full range of use cases supported by modern password managers. Additionally, most of these studies focus on high-level evaluations of password management, with few [3, 31] specifically identifying and studying the high-level designs (hereafter referred to as design paradigms) used to create password managers. This gap in the research literature means that the relative strengths and weaknesses of these design paradigms are unclear, preventing an informed approach to creating password managers.

To help guide the design of usability studies that address these gaps, we systematize the use cases and design paradigms for password management. This systematization is guided by a review of password management documentation, an examination of 12 desktop and 12 mobile password managers, and a review of the literature. Our systematization identifies seventeen use cases, categorized into essential use cases supported by all password managers, recommended use cases supported by a plurality of managers, and extended use cases supported by a minority of users or representing non-critical use cases. We also identified 77 design paradigms that can facilitate these use cases, 65 of which are built into deployed managers, three proposed in the research literature, and nine recommended based on our experiences evaluating managers.

While it is possible that a different set of authors would end up with a somewhat different taxonomy, this is true of nearly all systematizations published at top security conferences. Regardless, this systematization is sufficient to help guide future usability studies exploring the usability of use cases that have not been previously studied. Similarly, we expect that our enumeration of design paradigms will make it easier for researchers to identify and compare design paradigms in future studies.

As a first step in this direction, we used our systematization to perform cognitive walkthroughs of eight popular desktop managers, evaluating seventeen tasks covering the essential and recommended use cases identified in our systematization. While not a replacement for user studies, these cognitive walkthroughs help identify low-hanging usability issues in the studied managers [14, 34]. Observations from these walkthroughs include significant issues entering credentials when autofill is unavailable, confusing interface designs, and challenges linking credentials to multiple websites.

In summary, our contributions are:
1. **Identification of Password Management Use Cases (§2):** We identify seventeen different sets of tasks (i.e., use cases) that password managers support. We further categorize these use cases based on their importance to the password management experience. These use cases and their categorizations identify which functionality needs to be examined in user studies of password managers and can help inform the design of scenarios to use in those studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the majority of these use cases have not been previously studied.
2. **Enumeration of Design Paradigms (§3):** For each use case, we identify the system designs (i.e., design paradigms) used to support that use case. These design paradigms include those used in existing password managers, those proposed in the research literature, and several novel paradigms we propose in this work. This list of design paradigms can inform the creation of future user studies that compare these paradigms, revealing information about their relative advantages and disadvantages.
3. **Initial Exploration of Usability Challenges (§4):** In this paper, we demonstrate that most use cases, and by extension design paradigms, have not previously been studied. As a first step, we performed cognitive walkthroughs of eight desktop password managers, completing tasks related to the majority of the use cases. Observations from these walkthroughs help identify low-hanging usability issues that need to be addressed.

## 2. Use Cases

Understanding how password managers are intended to be used—i.e., their use cases—is critical in identifying what tasks should be studied in usability studies. While the password manager lifecycle can be described as supporting password generation, storage, and autofill [19], this list is overly vague and does not fully cover the myriad ways in which modern password managers are used. In this section, we provide a complete taxonomy of password manager use cases.

### 2.1 Essential Use Cases

Essential use cases focus on the core password management lifecycle and are supported in some fashion by all the managers we examined. The one exception is the Edge browser manager, which does not support password generation.

**E1: Setup Manager:** Users need to install and configure their password manager for first-time use. This may involve installing new software (an app or a browser extension) or enabling functionality built into the browser or operating system. For most managers, it also includes setting up an online account to support credential syncing.

**Tasks to Explore This Use Case:**
- Setting up a new manager for the first time.
- Setting up the manager on secondary devices.
