### Title: BlackHat Asia 2021: New Attack Surface in Safari: Exploiting a Single Web Audio Vulnerability to Gain Full Control

In the past, vulnerability researchers for Safari have primarily focused on the Document Object Model (DOM) and JavaScript (JS) engines. However, system libraries used by Safari, such as those for audio, video, and fonts, have received less attention. There are few documented cases of successful exploits using vulnerabilities in these modules to compromise Safari. 

Safari's built-in heap isolation mechanism ensures that the memory heaps used by these system libraries are separate from those used by DOM and JS objects. This separation makes it extremely challenging to exploit out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities in these modules, as they cannot easily overwrite key JS objects without additional information leaks.

I have dedicated significant time to bug hunting in the Web Audio module, with remarkable results. To date, I have discovered over 15 out-of-bounds read bugs and more than 10 out-of-bounds write bugs. Apple has acknowledged and credited 12 of these vulnerabilities. Due to the difficulty of performing heap spraying on the macOS heap, most of the out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities are hard to exploit independently in Safari. 

However, I identified a specific vulnerability that can cleverly overwrite JS objects, bypassing Safari's heap isolation, Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), and other defense mechanisms, ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution. I demonstrated this attack at the Tianfu Cup International Cybersecurity Competition, hosted by the Chengdu Municipal Government of China, and successfully compromised Safari with just one exploit.
