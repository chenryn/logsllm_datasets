### Implementation Details

For the ECDSA/PBC implementation, the user-end component is executed on a desktop computer equipped with an Intel Core i5-3470 processor. This processor has 4 cores, each running at 3.2 GHz. The operating system in use is Windows 10 Enterprise Edition. The server (or "RP") implementation is run on a Lenovo X3650 workstation, which features an Intel Xeon E5-2640 v3 processor with 8 cores, each operating at 2.60 GHz. The workstation runs CentOS 7 as its operating system. For HoKA-ECDSA/PBC, both the "IdP" and "RP" components are executed on the workstation, with different cores handling each application.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce a robust authentication mechanism that does not rely on tamper-resistant hardware modules at the user end. This mechanism is based on a new primitive called Password-Based Credential (PBC) and demonstrates its application in federated identity systems. We also present ΠPBC as an efficient construction of PBC and evaluate its performance. The evaluation results show that schemes using PBC achieve better efficiency compared to traditional strong authentication mechanisms that use tamper-resistant hardware modules. As part of our future work, we plan to develop and deploy PBC-based schemes in real-world application scenarios. We anticipate that our schemes will help organizations and enterprises provide their users with both friendly and strong authentication experiences in the future.
