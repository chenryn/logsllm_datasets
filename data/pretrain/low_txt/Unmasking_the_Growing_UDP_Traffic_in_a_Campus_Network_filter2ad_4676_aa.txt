## Abstract
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) has been the dominant protocol for Internet traffic over the past few decades. Most network research based on traffic analysis, such as router buffer sizing and traffic classification, has assumed the dominance of TCP. However, recent traffic statistics indicate a significant increase in User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic at various points in the Internet [21]. This paper examines the substantial growth of UDP traffic in our campus network, which has increased 46-fold (from 0.47% to 22.0% of total bytes) over the past four years. The 2011 trace data shows that this growth is not attributed to a small number of UDP hosts or port numbers. Additionally, recent UDP flows are not typically sent at a constant bit rate (CBR), and the aggregated traffic exhibits burstiness similar to TCP traffic.

## 1. Introduction
For many years, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) has been the primary protocol for Internet traffic, accounting for more than 90% of total traffic. In contrast, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) has been used primarily for specific purposes such as online gaming and multimedia streaming, thus consuming only a small share of Internet traffic. Consequently, network engineering research has focused on the dominance of TCP, with traffic classification efforts concentrating on identifying TCP applications. Popular UDP applications like PPLive and SopCast have received limited attention [8, 9]. Network experiments with synthetic traffic often model UDP as simple packet bunches sent at a constant bit rate [19].

Recent traffic statistics, however, show a growing trend in UDP traffic across various Internet links [21]. This trend has not been thoroughly studied, and its causes and impacts on the Internet remain unclear. While most traffic measurement studies have focused on TCP, some previous research has examined the characteristics of UDP traffic in terms of flow size, arrival patterns, and port usage [14, 16, 18, 20]. However, these studies used data collected before 2009, when UDP traffic was reported to be around 5% or less.

In this work, we report on the significant growth in UDP traffic over four years of continuous monitoring of the same network link. Our measurements from the campus network show a 46-fold increase in UDP volume (from 0.47% to 22.0% of total bytes). Using the 2011 trace data, we characterize the growth in terms of flow size, communication patterns, and sending rates. We find that the increase in volume is mainly due to larger flow sizes rather than an increase in the number of flows. Most UDP flows are not sent at a constant bit rate (CBR), and the growth is not attributed to a small number of UDP servers or port numbers. Finally, we show that recent UDP traffic exhibits comparable burstiness to TCP traffic.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides details on the datasets and evidence of recent growth in UDP traffic. Section 3 analyzes port usage and communication patterns to identify the types of traffic contributing to the growth. Section 4 examines the rate variation of UDP flows and the burstiness of UDP traffic. Section 5 concludes with the implications and lessons from our findings.

## 2. Growth Trend of UDP Traffic

### 2.1 Data Sets
We collected packet-level traces from 2008 to 2011 to capture the growth trend of UDP traffic on our campus network link. KAIST, with a population of about 10,000, including faculty, staff, and students, owns 2 /16 prefixes and 80 /24 prefixes. In 2009, a nearby college with about 1,100 people merged with KAIST, and KAIST acquired one of the 2 /16 prefixes and another 1 Gbps link to the outside. The campus network was reorganized in September 2009, routing all dormitory traffic via the new link. From 2008 to 2011, the overall population of KAIST grew from 7,000 to 10,000, mostly due to the merger and an increase in the incoming student body size. Despite the increase in population and network capacity, KAIST's traffic filtering policy remained unchanged: ICMP packets are dropped at the gateway, but no traffic suspected to be peer-to-peer downloads is filtered.

We used GPS-synchronized servers with DAG 4.3GE cards [1] to collect header-only traces from the 1 Gbps link connecting classrooms, labs, and offices to a commercial ISP. Due to privacy concerns, we did not collect payload information.

Table 1 summarizes the collected traces used in this paper. The traces from 2008 to 2011 were all collected on weekdays and at the same time of day to minimize errors from diurnal effects in Internet usage. Traces k-2008 and k-2009 were collected before the merger and network reconfiguration and include traffic from the dormitories. The slight decrease in overall data rates in 2010 and 2011 is attributed to the additional network capacity, but the link remains heavily utilized. In the spring of 2011, KAIST added another 1 Gbps link to the Internet.

| Trace Name | Time of Collection | Duration | Data Rate |
|------------|--------------------|----------|-----------|
| k-2008     | 2008/03/19 Wed 14:00 | 60 min   | 937.2 Mbps |
| k-2009     | 2009/04/27 Mon 14:00 | 60 min   | 927.8 Mbps |
| k-2010     | 2010/08/31 Tue 14:00 | 60 min   | 868.5 Mbps |
| k-2011     | 2011/01/07 Fri 14:00 | 60 min   | 855.8 Mbps |

In the rest of the paper, we use the incoming traffic from the Internet core to KAIST to represent end-users' Internet usage.

### 2.2 Growth in UDP Traffic Volume
Figure 1(a) shows that UDP traffic has increased to 22% over the past four years, with the minimum among the traces being 0.47% in 2008. The absolute volume of UDP traffic has grown significantly from 3.90 Mbps to 179.39 Mbps (a 46-fold increase in four years) as shown in Figure 1(b). This growth trend is consistent with a previous report [21] and similar trends observed in a trans-Pacific link of Japanese backbone networks [2] and CAIDA’s two monitors in Chicago [4]. The UDP data rate of the Japanese traces from 2006 to 2011 has been growing, with the largest portion observed being around 30%. CAIDA’s Chicago monitors report an average UDP data rate of 15-18% in August 2011, which is about 5% higher than the recent two-year average on the same links.

Although we present a single one-hour trace from 2011 in this paper, other traces collected in 2011 show similar shares of UDP around 20%, much larger than the share in 2008.

The number of UDP flows within an hour has also grown from 2.6 million in 2008 to 5.2 million in 2011, but not as much as the volume. We identify a UDP flow as a set of packets with the same source and destination IP addresses and port numbers. The increase in the number of flows from 2008 to 2011 is only 2-fold. The more critical cause of the recent UDP traffic growth is the change in the size of each flow rather than the total number of flows. The average flow size increased from 0.71 KB in 2008 to 16.32 KB in 2011. Previous work on TCP traffic trends has shown that the TCP flow size distribution remained similar from 2001 to 2009 [17], and our results on UDP are in contrast to these findings.

### 2.3 Growth in UDP Flow Size
Previous studies on UDP flows have suggested that they are small and short [16, 21, 22]. We seek to verify whether this still holds for recent UDP traffic. Figure 2 shows the cumulative volume by flow size for the UDP traffic in trace k-2011, along with distributions for UDP traffic in trace k-2008 and TCP traffic in k-2011 for comparison. We find that, in k-2011, flows larger than 100 KB account for 97.5% of the total volume, compared to 91.2% for TCP. Large flows dominate in UDP traffic as much as in TCP traffic or even more in some traces.

The packet size of UDP traffic has also grown dramatically from 2008 to 2011. Figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution of packet size over four years. The portion of UDP packets larger than 1,400 bytes is 43.2% in k-2011, compared to only 0.34% in k-2008. We observe that the packet size distribution of UDP from 2008 to 2011 has become bimodal, similar to TCP. In k-2011, packets either smaller than 100 bytes or larger than 1,400 bytes contribute 89.2% of the total packets for UDP and 91.5% for TCP.

Finally, we examine the duration of UDP flows. A flow's duration is calculated as the time between the first and last packet within a flow. We find that 76.4% of flows have zero duration because they consist of only one packet. The lifetime of flows with more than two packets spans up to one hour, the upper limit imposed by our data collection. In summary, there are many very short UDP flows of one packet, but a small number of large flows account for most of the volume.

### 3.1 Port Usage in UDP Traffic
Port number usage is a key measure for understanding the type of traffic and is often used to identify applications such as web surfing, online gaming, and peer-to-peer transfers with fixed port numbers [11, 13, 14, 18, 21]. Figure 4 plots the cumulative UDP traffic volume against the source and destination ports in k-2011. The source port numbers used by UDP flows are distributed across the entire port allocation range. The largest volume on a single port number is 2.15% at port 47,391, which is not as high as the volume carried on port 80 (HTTP) in TCP traffic. Traces from various network links report up to 62.9% of the total volume from port 80.

## 4. Rate Variation and Burstiness of UDP Traffic
In this section, we study the rate variation of UDP flows and the burstiness of UDP traffic. We find that most recent UDP flows are not sent at a constant bit rate (CBR). The aggregated UDP traffic shows burstiness similar to TCP traffic, indicating that the behavior of UDP traffic is becoming more complex and variable.

## 5. Conclusion
In conclusion, our findings show a significant and ongoing growth in UDP traffic in our campus network. The increase in volume is primarily due to larger flow sizes rather than an increase in the number of flows. Most UDP flows are not sent at a constant bit rate, and the growth is not attributed to a small number of UDP servers or port numbers. Recent UDP traffic exhibits burstiness similar to TCP traffic. These findings have important implications for network engineering and traffic management, suggesting that future research and network design should consider the increasing role of UDP in Internet traffic.
