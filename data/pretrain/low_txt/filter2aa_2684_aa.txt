## Covert Testing
### Overview
Covert testing is a method used by legitimate vulnerability assessment firms and Red Teams to help companies and organizations identify and mitigate potential security threats. The primary focus is on:
- Identifying possible intrusions
- Detecting faulty equipment or software
- Uncovering bad security practices
- Evaluating ineffective policies

At the end of the assessment, a detailed report is provided to the organization, enabling them to implement an informed plan for addressing the discovered deficiencies.

### Misuse
However, covert testing can also be misused by other companies and governments for their own gain, such as corporate espionage.

## Corporate Espionage
### Example Cases
- **DuPont Case (February 16, 2007)**:
  - A former DuPont scientist stole $400 million in intellectual property.
  - Source: SC Magazine, "The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) pulled the covers off a previously-sealed case of corporate espionage."

- **VBi Triscan Systems (April 20, 2007)**:
  - Laptops and hard disks were stolen, leading to fears of industrial espionage.
  - Source: The Register, "A UK-based hi-tech firm that's become the victim of 'industrial espionage' is offering a reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for stealing its computer hardware."

## Ethical Considerations
- **Hacker Ethic**:
  - We have no allegiance, no political motive, and no fiscal gain. We are simply exploring and passing through.

## Game Consoles as More Than Just Gaming Devices
### Realization
After modifying my first XBOX and purchasing a PSP, I realized that modern game consoles could be much more than just gaming devices. Prior to 2002, console hacking was limited to crude hardware modifications and game cheating. Since then, the industry has advanced, using more powerful processors and GPUs to meet and build gamer expectations.

### Current Capabilities
Now, we have true computers with the ability to network, share, probe, perform vulnerability scans, and even infiltrate networks. This raises significant security concerns.

### Stimulation
- **Sixth & Seventh Generation Game Consoles**
- **Hand-held Game Systems**
- **Ubiquitous Online Connectivity (wired/wireless)**

### Goals
- **Cover the three key features** a covert tester looks for in penetration hardware and why game consoles can fit the bill.
- **Examine the evolution** of homebrew applications on various game systems.
- **Demonstrate** how game systems can be used to infiltrate networks or collect data.
- **Suggest** mitigation strategies.
- **Discuss** future trends and implications.

## Three Important Features for Covert Testing
1. **Power (Potential)**
2. **Programmability (Flexibility)**
3. **Concealment (Plausible Deniability)**
