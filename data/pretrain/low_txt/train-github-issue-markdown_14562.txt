The illustration in `tf.gather` is incorrect. Specifically, `P_5` in the `params` tensor should correspond to `P_5` in the `indices` tensor. 

For clarity, `tf.gather` should map each index in the `indices` tensor to the corresponding element in the `params` tensor. In this case, `P_5` in `params` should be correctly referenced by `P_5` in `indices`.
