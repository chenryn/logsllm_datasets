### 7.2 Baseline Composition

**Impact of Scanning on Baseline Radiation:**
Our findings from both the CDN telescope and the UCSD darknet indicate that virtually all IPv4 addresses receive a baseline of approximately 3000 packets daily, as of November 2018. With our tools to detect and characterize scanning activity, we can now revisit this observation.

**Figure 12: Effect of Internet-Wide Scanning Activity on Background Radiation**
- **Description:** The figure shows the effect of removing packets resulting from Internet-wide scans on the background radiation. It demonstrates that the baseline of unsolicited traffic reduces by about 90% when these packets are filtered out, while localized spikes persist.
- **Data Points:**
  - **Top Two Machines (Baseline Radiation Only):** The traffic logged by these machines reduces by more than 90%, leaving only about 10% of logged packets that cannot be attributed to Internet-wide scanners.
  - **Bottom-Left Example (CDN-Agnostic Spikes):** Removing random scan activity shifts the number of logged packets by approximately 2.8K, but the spikes remain visible, indicating they are not part of random scans.
  - **Bottom-Right Example (Operations Interface):** The baseline radiation received on the operations interface mostly cancels out when removing scanners, while CDN-targeted packets remain visible, shifted by approximately 2.8K packets.

**Baseline and Position in the Address Space:**
- **Observation 1:** Routed IPv4 addresses receive a baseline of about 3000 packets daily due to Internet-wide scans of the IPv4 space. This baseline is consistent across the address space, regardless of the vantage point.
- **Observation 2:** Localized scanning activity can be clearly distinguished from the baseline caused by Internet-wide scans. The visibility of localized scanning activity is heavily dependent on the location of the telescope IP addresses in the IPv4 space.

### 7.3 Long-Term Baseline Evolution

**Focus and Stability:**
In this study, we focus on the month of November 2018. Our findings regarding the baseline scan radiation are remarkably stable over this period. We next examine whether this stability holds over longer timescales and if there are any long-term trends.

**Figure 13: Median and 25th/75th Percentile of Daily Logged Packets per IP Address Over 3 Years**
- **Description:** The figure shows the median, 25th, and 75th percentile of daily logged packets per IP address over three years, excluding machines with significantly more or less traffic than the average.
- **Trends:**
  - **Increase in Baseline Activity:** Over three years, we observe a 3-fold increase in baseline activity, from approximately 1000 packets in early 2016 to about 3100 in December 2018.
  - **Spike in Late 2016, Early 2017:** This spike coincides with the widespread infections of the Mirai botnet, which increased scanning activity, as evidenced in another network telescope [8].
  - **Steady Increase Post-2017:** After the Mirai activity leveled off in 2017, we see a steady increasing trend of baseline radiation over the next 1.5 years.
  - **Future Projections:** If current trends continue, we can expect overall scanning activity and the resulting baseline radiation to continue increasing in the foreseeable future.

### 8. DISCUSSION

**Implications for Researchers and Network Operators:**

**Interpretation of Scan Data:**
- **Key Finding:** Our work provides evidence of widespread localized scanning activity in todayâ€™s Internet. Such scans pose a potentially greater threat as they may target individual networks and hosts, unlike Internet-wide scans.
- **Darknets and Monitoring:** While large darknets provide excellent visibility into random scanning activity, they severely underestimate the number and volume of localized scans. Our introduced tools and metrics help identify and isolate localized scans, making them distinct and more manageable.

**Threat Identification:**
- **Practical Value:** The finding that most background radiation a typical IPv4 address receives relates to scanning activity has practical value for researchers and network operators. Any routed IPv4 address can expect to receive baseline scan radiation consistently.
- **Network Operator Actions:** Once a baseline radiation level is established, network operators can determine if their individual hosts or infrastructure receive significantly higher levels of radiation and scan activity, indicating potential targeted localized scans. Operators can adapt our method to partition addresses into buckets and assess randomness, detecting scans focused on subsets of their network.

### 8.2 Future Work

**Understanding Localized Scans:**
- **Root Causes:** Further research is needed to understand the root causes of localized scanning activity. Our distributed vantage point shows that many of these scans target narrow regions of the address space.
- **Target Selection:** Leveraging external data such as IP hitlists and data from honeypots could further illuminate localized and stateful target selection strategies.
- **Long-Term Analysis:** Studying long-term characteristics (e.g., months) of individual source IP addresses could shed light on root causes for scan activity, such as botnet infections versus repeated targeted scanning campaigns.

**Correlating Scans and Cyberattacks:**
- **Visibility:** Our vantage point provides visibility into both scanning activity and cyberattacks, offering a rare opportunity to track the scanning of IPv4 space for newly discovered vulnerabilities and subsequent cyberattacks carried out by infected devices.

**IPv6 Traffic:**
- **Current Trends:** Unsolicited IPv6 traffic, currently a small fraction of probing traffic, is more likely due to responses from forward DNS queries. As IPv6 connectivity grows, this traffic could become significant, and we plan to assess its impact.
