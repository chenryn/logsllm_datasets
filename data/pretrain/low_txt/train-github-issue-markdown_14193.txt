### Issue: Select Component Behavior in Material-UI Next

**Summary:**
The `Select` component in Material-UI Next behaves differently compared to the older version (Material-UI 0.19). In the old version, users could open the select box, type to filter and highlight an option, and then press `Enter` to select it. This functionality is missing in the newer version.

**Expected Behavior:**
- When the select box is opened, typing one of the valid options should highlight that option.
- Pressing `Enter` should select the highlighted option.

**Current Behavior:**
- Typing or pressing `Enter` does not select any option, even though this feature worked in Material-UI 0.19.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Go to the [Material-UI Selects demo page](https://material-ui.com/demos/selects/).
2. Click on the "Age" select box.
3. Type "Twenty" and press `Enter`.
4. Observe that no option is selected.
5. Try the same steps with the "Native Select" component below.
6. For comparison, perform the same steps on the [Material-UI 0.19 Select Field demo page](http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/select-field) (where the feature works as expected).

**Context:**
This feature is important for user navigation and selection. It is a common and expected behavior for such components, enhancing usability by allowing quick filtering and selection through keyboard input.

**Environment:**
- The issue can be reproduced on the Material-UI Next website, regardless of the local environment.

**Additional Notes:**
- I have searched the repository issues and believe this is not a duplicate.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
