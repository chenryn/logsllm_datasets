# Figures and Data Presentation

Below are the figures and data presented in a more organized and professional manner. The text has been cleaned up, and the figures have been properly labeled and described.

## Figure 2: CDN Usage and Median RTTs for Microsoft over IPv4
- **(a) CDN Providers for Microsoft’s OS Updates over IPv4**
  - This graph shows the fraction of clients receiving Windows updates over IPv4 from different CDNs over time.
  - Key providers include Microsoft's own network, Akamai, Level 3, and various edge caches.
  - Notable trends:
    - Microsoft's network served 45% of clients in mid-2015, declining to 11% by April 2017.
    - Level 3's share increased until February 2017, then declined.
    - Edge caches (including Akamai) served 40% of clients in August 2017, increasing to 70% by August 2018.

- **(b) Median RTT Values for Microsoft IPv4 Clients**
  - The median RTT for IPv4 clients is approximately 20 ms.
  - Edge caches provide the lowest latency, with median RTTs between 10 and 25 ms.

## Figure 3: CDN Usage and Median RTTs for Microsoft over IPv6
- **(a) CDN Providers for Microsoft’s OS Updates over IPv6**
  - Similar to IPv4, but Microsoft's network did not support IPv6 until November 2015.
  - After that, the CDN mix for IPv6 clients is similar to IPv4.

- **(b) Median RTT Values for Microsoft IPv6 Clients**
  - The median RTT for IPv6 clients is also around 20 ms, with some exceptions for Level 3 clients.

## Figure 4: CDN Usage and Median RTTs for Apple
- **(a) CDN Providers for Apple’s OS Updates**
  - Over 85% of Apple's clients receive content directly from Apple's networks.
  - Only 10-15% of clients use other CDNs like Limelight, Akamai, and Level 3.

- **(b) Median RTT Values for Apple Clients**
  - Edge caches provide low latency access, with median RTTs between 10 and 25 ms.

## Section 4.1: Multi-CDN Mixture
- **Microsoft's Strategy:**
  - Most clients receive updates from Microsoft, Akamai, Level 3, and edge caches.
  - Microsoft's direct service declined from 45% in 2015 to 11% in 2017.
  - Level 3's share increased until 2017, then declined.
  - Edge caches (including Akamai) served 40% of clients in 2017, increasing to 70% by 2018.

- **Apple's Strategy:**
  - Over 85% of Apple's clients get content directly from Apple.
  - Only 10-15% use other CDNs.

## Section 4.2: Performance of CDNs
- **Median RTT:**
  - For both Microsoft (IPv4 and IPv6) and Apple, edge caches provide the lowest latency, with median RTTs between 10 and 25 ms.
  - Microsoft relies heavily on Akamai's edge caches, while Apple does not, but still benefits from edge cache deployments.

## Section 4.3: Regional Trends in Performance
- **Figure 5: Median RTT by Continent**
  - North American and European clients observe stable low latencies (near or below 20 ms).
  - African clients show a downward trend in median RTT, but still experience higher latencies (around 50 ms).
  - Apple's clients in Africa and South America experience much worse latency (over 100 ms).

- **Level 3 Latency:**
  - Level 3 has high latency in developing regions.
  - In Africa, 17% of clients using Level 3 observe large RTT values (around 168 ms).
  - In Africa, 75% of Apple's clients using Level 3 experience high latency.

## Section 5: Stability of CDN Assignments
- **Metrics:**
  - Prevalence: Probability of a client receiving content from a given CDN prefix.
  - Number of CDN prefixes seen per day: Lower number implies more stable mapping.

- **Trends:**
  - General decreasing trend in server prevalence, especially in North America.
  - Increasing trend in the number of CDN prefixes observed per day, indicating less stable mappings.

- **Stability and Latency:**
  - Lower RTTs correlate with more stable (high prevalence) server mappings.

## Section 6: Impact of CDN Migration
- **Level 3 Migration:**
  - Migrating away from Level 3 improves latency in developing regions and Oceania.
  - For example, migration away from Level 3 leads to improved RTTs 83%, 75%, and 71% of the time for clients in Oceania, Asia, and South America, respectively.

- **Edge Caches:**
  - Migrating from non-edge caches to edge caches can significantly improve latency.
  - Edge caches provide low latency access, particularly in developing regions.

This reorganization and clarification should make the data and analysis more accessible and easier to understand.
