### Eavesdropping and Security Vulnerabilities in Mobile Networks

Mobile networks, particularly GSM, are vulnerable to passive attacks due to weak encryption algorithms. Ciphertext-only attacks [56]–[58] allow an attacker to break standard algorithms like A5/1 and A5/2 within a few minutes using ordinary hardware and rainbow tables [59]. Consequently, the attacker can eavesdrop on the communication.

In our user data manipulation attack, we do not exploit weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms of LTE but instead leverage the malleability of the cipher, for example, by performing a chosen-ciphertext attack. This approach has negligible overhead and allows us to compromise the data link layer security, even with state-of-the-art encryption in place.

### Conclusion

While much research on LTE security has focused on the physical and network layers, the data link layer remains relatively unexplored. We present a comprehensive security analysis of the data link layer and reveal several open attack vectors. Specifically, we describe three distinct attacks on the LTE data link layer:

1. **Identity Mapping Attack**: This passive attack matches two temporary identifiers, revealing the location and radio layer identity of users within the mobile cell. It serves as a starting point for further attacks.
   
2. **Website Fingerprinting Attack**: By exploiting scheduling information for resource allocation in LTE, we demonstrate how an adversary can infer the websites accessed by a user based on unencrypted metadata, leading to severe privacy implications.

3. **User Data Manipulation Attack (ALTER)**: We perform a chosen-ciphertext attack by deploying a malicious relay and exploiting the lack of integrity protection in LTE user data. This allows us to redirect DNS requests and spoof DNS responses. We have demonstrated the real-world feasibility of all three attacks in realistic setups.

Based on our findings, we strongly recommend the implementation of effective countermeasures in the upcoming 5G specification to ensure the security and privacy of future mobile communications.
