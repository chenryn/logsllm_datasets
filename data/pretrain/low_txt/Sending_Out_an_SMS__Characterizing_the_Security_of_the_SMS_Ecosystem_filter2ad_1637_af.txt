### Licious Behavior and SMS Security

While previous research has explored the content and metadata of SMS in the context of spam [46, 60, 61, 75], this study is the first to comprehensively measure how SMS is used for security purposes by legitimate services. Notably, much of the existing research in this area has been limited to small datasets, with some studies using fewer than 2,000 messages [61]. Mobile two-factor authentication (2FA) is gaining popularity, with some experts enthusiastically endorsing its adoption [27], while others caution that it may only provide a marginal increase in security [63]. A significant portion of our collected data includes mobile 2FA tokens sent via SMS. Although SMS tokens are widely used in various contexts, such as mobile banking and finance [62], alternative methods have also been implemented, including keychain fobs [7, 18], one-time pads [56, 64], biometric scanners [31, 67], and mobile phones [10, 26].

### Emphasis on Phone-Verified Accounts

Our focus on phone-verified accounts (PVAs) provides a unique contribution. Thomas et al. [72] studied the effects of PVAs at Google, using datasets of purchased or disabled PVAs. In contrast, our work offers insights into PVA fraud from enabling services. While we confirm some of their observations, our data suggest that their recommendations may be insufficient to prevent PVA evasion.

### Conclusions

Text messaging has become a critical component of the security infrastructure. However, this ecosystem has evolved significantly since its inception, now encompassing a wide range of devices and participants beyond traditional cellular providers. Public SMS gateways exemplify this change, allowing us to observe at scale how various providers implement security solutions via text messages and how assumptions about SMS are being circumvented. Although our data may not cover all SMS communications, our measurements highlight popular services whose one-time messaging mechanisms need improvement and entities that may be creating new vulnerabilities by sending highly sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) through these channels. On the abuse side, we see the ease with which these gateways are being used to bypass authentication mechanisms, and we show that previously proposed mitigations to PVA fraud, such as block banning, are unlikely to be effective in practice. These findings indicate that all providers relying on SMS as an out-of-band channel for authentication should reassess their current solutions in light of this evolving landscape.
