## Problem
- **SQL Injection Prevalence**: 97% of data breach cases worldwide involve SQL injection attacks.
- **Cost Implications**: The average cost of data breach response and remediation is between $194 to $222 per record.
- **Incidence of Breaches**: As of July 9th, privacyrights.org reports 330 breaches in 2012, affecting 18.6 million records (datalossdb.org reports a higher number of 723 breaches).

## Historical Solution
- **High Cost**: Traditional responses to data breaches are expensive.
- **Consultant Deployment**: Consultants are flown to the data center to image the server.
- **Log Analysis**: Logs are analyzed to determine what data was exfiltrated.
- **SQL Command Execution**: SQL commands are run against the SQL server to identify exfiltrated data.
- **Rising Costs**: This method is becoming increasingly costly.
