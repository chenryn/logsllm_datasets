### Simple Equality Testing and Concise Representation
The approach employs simple equality testing instead of more resource-intensive, privacy-preserving threshold set intersection. A concise representation of "location tags" is achieved by generating compact sketches via shingling. These sketches are short strings that represent the set of broadcast messages received.

### Summary of Contributions
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to demonstrate how to integrate Count-Min Sketch with privacy-friendly data aggregation to build a private estimated model for both recommendations and future location predictions. Additionally, our scheme for Tor hidden services statistics, which combines Count Sketch, additively homomorphic threshold decryption, and differential privacy, is the first to address the challenge of efficiently computing median statistics.

### Conclusion
This paper presents efficient techniques for privately and efficiently collecting statistics using private data aggregation protocols and succinct data structures. These methods reduce the communication and computation complexity from linear to logarithmic in the size of the input, while only introducing a limited, upper-bounded error in the quality of the statistics.

Our techniques support various trust, robustness, and deployment models and can be applied to a range of real-world problems where aggregate statistics are used to train models. We have designed and deployed a private recommender system for streaming services and a private location prediction service. Our server-side implementation as a JavaScript web application allows developers to easily incorporate it into their projects. The user-side is supported both in the browser (requiring no additional software) and on Android. We also designed and implemented (in Python) a scheme for computing the median statistics of Tor hidden services in a privacy-friendly manner.

### Future Work
As part of our future work, we plan to apply our private recommender system to the BBC news apps for Android, conduct a test deployment of the private location prediction service with a local mass transit operator, and extend our protocols to privately consolidate data shared by different sources. We are also working on releasing a comprehensive framework supporting large-scale privacy-preserving aggregation as a service.
