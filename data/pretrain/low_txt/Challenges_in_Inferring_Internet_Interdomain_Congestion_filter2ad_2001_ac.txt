### Observations and Analysis

From our Ark monitor in Level3’s network, we observed congestion on Level3’s interconnections with both AT&T and Verizon in Dallas. These links were congested for 6 hours during weekdays and up to 16 hours during weekends in March/April 2014. The observations are consistent with the anonymized MRTG graph published by Level3.

- **AT&T Congestion**:
  - On March 31st, AT&T was congested for a longer period.
  - The last day we observed the diurnal pattern was July 14th. Our Ark monitor was down until the 19th, and the signal was gone when the monitor restarted.

- **Verizon Congestion**:
  - The last day we observed the diurnal pattern was June 22nd.

This example demonstrates the effectiveness of our technique in:
1. Providing independent evidence of specific congestion.
2. Identifying the parties involved, even when they cannot do so due to NDA agreements.
3. Informing the public debate on internet congestion.

### Other Related Work

Current methods of measuring systematic congestion require instrumentation at both ends of a path being measured [18, 30]. However, our TSLP method can potentially measure congestion from any VP hosted in an AS to any interdomain link involving that AS, provided the link can be isolated.

- **In-Home Performance**:
  - Researchers have studied in-home performance issues [7, 11].
  - Broadband access performance has been analyzed [2, 16, 23, 34] to determine if these components are the end-to-end performance bottlenecks for most users.

- **Network Performance Inference**:
  - Liu and Crovella used simulation to show that the loss-pairs methodology [24] can infer if a router uses AQM or tail-drop.
  - Mahimkar et al. used a level shift detection algorithm to correlate changes in network performance with network upgrades [28].

### Conclusion

We developed and tested a simple method for identifying congestion on interdomain links. This method was used to study several incidents of reported congestion that correlate with reports of contested business negotiations between ASes. The advantages of this method include its conceptual, implementation, and deployment simplicity. Unlike experiments that produce broadband performance maps, which require VPs at many access points, our method can measure interdomain links from a given serving area of an ISP with one VP. Most importantly, the TSLP method does not require a server on the other side of the link being probed.

The major challenge is not finding evidence of congestion but reliably associating it with a particular link. This difficulty arises from inconsistent interface numbering conventions and the fact that a router may report IP interface addresses from third-party ASes. We plan to further study this problem and focus on localizing the directionality of congestion.

We have reported early results from a new project to detect and measure congestion at Internet interconnection points. For the thousands of interconnection links we have probed thus far, we have not found evidence of widespread persistent congestion, which is good news. However, this also suggests the value of a lightweight technique that can locate interdomain congestion from a VP at the edge. We plan to deploy VPs in as many access networks as possible to generate a global "congestion heat map" of the Internet, cross-validate with non-ICMP traffic, and publish evidence of congestion over time.
