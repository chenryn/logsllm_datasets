### L-3 Communications Westwood Corp. v. Robichaux, 2007 WL 756528 (E.D. La. Mar 08, 2007)

**Case Summary:**
- **Defendants:** Employees of L-3 Communications
- **Incident:** Computer forensics revealed that 110,000 files were copied to a 120 GB external hard drive.
- **Legal Issue:** L-3's loss of trade secrets and lost profits are not covered by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). The CFAA allows recovery for losses only if they result from damage to a computer system or the inoperability of the accessed system. Losses in revenue are compensable under the CFAA only if they are connected to an interruption of service.
- **Court Ruling:** Since L-3 did not allege any damage to its computers or an interruption of service, it has not demonstrated a cognizable loss under the CFAA. Therefore, L-3 has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of the CFAA claim.

### P.C. of Yonkers, Inc. v. Celebrations! The Party and Seasonal Superstore, L.L.C., 2007 WL 708978 (D. N.J. Mar 05, 2007)

**Case Summary:**
- **Legal Requirement:** The CFAA's private cause of action requires a two-part injury:
  1. A root injury of damage or loss.
  2. One of five operatively-substantial effects as defined in subsection (a)(5)(B)(i)-(v):
     - (i) Aggregated loss of at least $5,000 in value over a one-year period.
     - (ii) Modification or impairment of medical examination, diagnosis, treatment, or care.
     - (iii) Physical injury to any person.
     - (iv) A threat to public health or safety.
     - (v) Damage affecting a government entity's computer system used for justice, national defense, or security.
- **Plaintiff's Allegation:** No damage to the data, system, or information on the plaintiffs' computers was alleged. The CFAA defines "loss" separately from "damage," including costs of responding to the offense, conducting a damage assessment, restoring data, and lost revenue due to service interruption.
- **Court Ruling:** Lost revenue is treated differently from incurred costs under the CFAA and is recoverable only if connected to a service interruption. The plaintiffs claimed substantial losses exceeding $5,000, including costs of responding to, investigating, and taking remedial actions against the defendants' unauthorized access and use of information.
