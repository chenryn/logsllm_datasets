## Overview
Driverless vehicles and unmanned systems are revolutionizing various industries, from transportation to military operations. This document explores the advantages, challenges, and vulnerabilities of these autonomous systems, as well as their potential applications and security concerns.

## Competitions and Challenges
- **Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC)**
- **Student Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS)**
- **RoboBoat**
- **RoboSub**
- **International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC)**

### Advantages of Autonomous Systems
- **Energy Efficiency**: Reduced fuel consumption.
- **Time Efficiency**: Improved operational efficiency.
- **New Applications**: Diverse use cases in various fields.

## The Revolution Is Coming
The advent of autonomous and unmanned systems is transforming the way we live and work. These systems can operate without a human driver or pilot on board, and may have off-board controllers or on-board safety pilots. Early adopters include the military.

### Military Adoption
- **Northrop Grumman**: Unmanned Advanced Capability Aircraft and Ground Combat Vehicles
- **National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (S. 2549, Sec. 217)**: By 2015, one-third of operational ground combat vehicles should be unmanned.

### Civil Applications
- **Transportation**
- **Filmmaking**
- **Oceanography**
- **Mapping**
- **Logistics**
- **Powerline Inspection**

#### Priorities
- **Precision Agriculture**
- **Self-Driving Cars**

#### Roadblocks
- **Shared Infrastructure** (Airspace, Roads)
- **Acceptance** (Safety, Robustness)

## Classic Failures
### RQ-3 DarkStar
- **Unit Procurement Cost**: $10 million (Units 11-20, 1994 $)
- **Failure**: On its second flight, a software fault in the flight control system caused porpoising oscillations, leading to a nose-high stall and crash.

### Sandstorm (DARPA Grand Challenge 2004)
- **Challenges**:
  - Deciding what the robot "knows" is a constant battle.
  - Correct state estimation is key to decision-making.
  - Successful exploits often subvert state estimation.

## Autonomous Vehicle Logic Structures
### Activity Hierarchy
- **Control Loops, Stability Maintenance**
- **Collision Avoidance**
- **Navigation & Localization**
- **Mission Task Planners/Reasoners**

### Vulnerabilities
- **Attacks lower in the stack defeat everything above.**
- **More engineering effort is spent on guaranteed robustness at lower levels.**
- **Lower layers may be juicier but harder targets.**

### Examples
- **Lifesaving Drone**
  - **Autopilot PID loops tuned for environmental conditions**
  - **GPS waypoint circuit**
  - **Dynamic “bombing run” planner, impact point estimator**
- **Pizza Delivery**
  - **Balancing, weight shifting**
  - **Dynamic obstacle discrimination & avoidance**
  - **Route planning from SLAM-generated sensor map**
  - **Dispense pizza to credit card**

### Mission Oriented State Machines
- **States may correspond to tasks.**
- **Transitions may be task completions, context switches, or timeouts.**
- **States may contain nested state machines, reasoners, planners, etc.**

### Example: Robosub Mission
- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - **State estimation**
  - **Transitions (spoofing or preventing)**
  - **Unexpected conditions within states**

## Sensors
### Common Sensors
- **GPS**
- **LIDAR**
- **Cameras**
- **Millimeter Wave Radar**
- **Digital Compass**
- **IMU**
- **Wheel Encoders**
- **Doppler Velocity Logger (subsurface)**
- **Scanning SONAR (subsurface)**
- **Pressure Transducers (air & subsurface)**

### Sources of Uncertainty
- **Noise**
- **Drift**
- **Latency & update rate**

### Sensor Fusion
- **Fused/registered data can be more useful than separate.**
- **What to do when sensors disagree?**
- **Robot robustness may depend on how smart it is at discounting bad/spoofed sensors.**

## Sensor Attacks
### Types
- **Denial**: Preventing sensors from recovering useful data.
- **Spoofing**: Causing sensors to retrieve specifically incorrect data.

### GPS
- **Denial**: Jamming
- **Spoofing**: Fake GPS satellite signals at higher power

### LIDAR
- **Denial**: Active overpowering, preventing return signal
- **Spoofing**: Manipulating absorbence/reflectivity

### Cameras
- **Denial**: Easily dazzled
- **Spoofing**: Camouflage techniques, color assumptions, repeating patterns

### MMW RADAR
- **Denial/Spoofing**: Chaff, overhead signs

### IMU & Compass
- **Denial/Spoofing**: Extremely difficult to interfere with, physical attack with magnetic fields

### Wheel Odometry
- **Attacks**: Change wheel diameter, slippery surface, removal may cause unpredictable behavior or stoppage

## Physical Attacks
### Bond vs Robots
- **GPS Jammer**
- **Smoke/Dust/Vapor**
- **Chaff**
- **Glass caltrops**
- **Oil slick**

### The Map
- **Preacquired map data**: Often considered reference ground truth.
- **Reduces recognition load**: Traffic lights, vegetation, other speed control & traffic management features.
- **Map dependence may exacerbate brittleness of discrimination rules.**

### Exploiting the Logic Structure
- **Goal**: Maximize uncertainty, requiring manual assistance, confusing/annoying occupants, inconveniencing other road users.
- **Concentrate on fragile maneuvers**.

### Trapping/Redirecting
- **Attacks at collision avoidance & navigation layers**: Force robot to postpone high-level tasks.
- **Moving obstacles, obstacle swarms, artificial stop lights**.

### Clobbering
- **Goal**: Make robot run into something.
- **Subvert collision avoidance, incapacitate vehicle, damage/remove sensors, subtle map deviations, imitate light vegetation, simulate obstacles at speed, disguise entrance walls with reflective/absorbent material within GPS noise, dynamic obstacles under overhead signs**.

## Ethical Considerations
- **Driverless vehicles are cool!**
- **Don’t do any of these things!**
- **Don’t hassle the Hoff!**
- **Don’t hax0r the Bots!**
- **Instead, hack on them!**
