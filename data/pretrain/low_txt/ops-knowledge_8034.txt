### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:06:37 to 18:06:43 on October 18, documents several recurring issues in a Hadoop environment. The key points are as follows:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component is repeatedly failing to renew the lease for the `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` client.
   - The failure occurs every second, with the duration increasing from 99 seconds to 104 seconds.
   - Each failure is followed by a warning that the system will retry shortly.

2. **Resource Manager (RM) Communication Issues**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is unable to contact the Resource Manager (RM) at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - This error occurs multiple times, and each time, the system retries the connection.
   - The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep`, with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between retries.

3. **Address Changes**:
   - There are frequent address changes detected by the `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` component.
   - The old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:port`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:port`, where `port` is either 8030 or 9000.
   - These address changes occur for both the RM and the `LeaseRenewer` components.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **10-18 18:06:37**:
  - A warning is logged indicating that the lease renewal for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` failed after 99 seconds. The system will retry shortly.

- **10-18 18:06:38**:
  - An info message logs the attempt to reconnect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`. No previous attempts have been made, and the retry policy is set.
  - An error message indicates that the RM cannot be contacted.
  - A warning logs an address change for the `LeaseRenewer` component.
  - Another warning logs a lease renewal failure after 100 seconds.

- **10-18 18:06:39**:
  - A warning logs an address change for the `RMCommunicator Allocator`.
  - Two warnings log address changes for the `LeaseRenewer` component.
  - Another warning logs a lease renewal failure after 101 seconds.

- **10-18 18:06:40**:
  - An info message logs another attempt to reconnect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
  - An error message indicates that the RM cannot be contacted.
  - A warning logs an address change for the `LeaseRenewer` component.
  - Another warning logs a lease renewal failure after 102 seconds.

- **10-18 18:06:41**:
  - A warning logs an address change for the `RMCommunicator Allocator`.
  - Two warnings log address changes for the `LeaseRenewer` component.
  - Another warning logs a lease renewal failure after 103 seconds.

- **10-18 18:06:42**:
  - An info message logs another attempt to reconnect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
  - An error message indicates that the RM cannot be contacted.
  - A warning logs an address change for the `LeaseRenewer` component.
  - Another warning logs a lease renewal failure after 104 seconds.

- **10-18 18:06:43**:
  - A warning logs an address change for the `RMCommunicator Allocator`.

### Conclusion

The log indicates persistent issues with lease renewal and communication with the Resource Manager, along with frequent address changes. These issues suggest potential network instability or configuration problems that need to be addressed to ensure the smooth operation of the Hadoop cluster.
