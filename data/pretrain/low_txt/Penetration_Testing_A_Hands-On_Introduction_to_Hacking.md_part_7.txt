     - [http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/Windows-7.shtml](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/Windows-7.shtml)
     - [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/dn407368](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/dn407368)
2. **Create User Account**:
   - Opt out of security updates and create a user account named `Georgia Weidman` as an administrator with the password `password` (refer to Figures 1-49 and 1-50).
   - Opt out of automatic updates and set the computer’s current location to a work network.
   - Log in to the `Georgia Weidman` account and leave the Windows Firewall enabled.
3. **Install VMware Tools**:
   - Tell VMware to install VMware Tools, as you did in the Windows XP section.
   - If the installer does not automatically run, go to `My Computer` and run the VMware Tools installer from the virtual machine’s DVD drive (refer to Figure 1-51).

   - If asked whether to configure this network as Home, Work, or Public, choose "Work."
   - Ensure the virtual machine network setting is configured to use a bridged adapter.

**Figure 1-53: Setting a static IP address**

### Ping Test
1. **Test Connectivity**:
   - Start your Kali Linux virtual machine.
   - From the Windows 7 virtual machine, open a command prompt and enter `ping <Kali_IP_Address>`.
   - If everything is working, you should see replies to the ping request.

### Adding a Second Network Interface
1. **Add Network Adapter**:
   - Shut down the Windows 7 virtual machine.
   - In VMware Player on Microsoft Windows, go to `Player > Manage > Virtual Machine Settings > Add`, select "Network Adapter," and press "Next."
   - This adapter will be "Network Adapter 2."
   - In VMware Fusion on Mac OS, go to `Virtual Machine Settings`, select "Add a Device," and select a network adapter.
   - Set this new adapter to the "Host Only" network and press "OK."
   - The virtual machine should restart. When it restarts, open `Virtual Machine Settings` again to ensure both network adapters are listed and connected.

### Summary
In this chapter, we set up our virtual environment, downloaded and customized Kali Linux for attacks, configured our virtual network, and configured our target operating systems—Windows XP, Windows 7, and Ubuntu. In the next chapter, we will familiarize ourselves with the Linux command line and begin to explore the many penetration testing tools and techniques covered in this book.

### Using Kali Linux
You will use Kali Linux as the attack platform throughout this book. Kali, the successor to the popular BackTrack Linux, is a Debian-based distribution that comes with a plethora of preinstalled and preconfigured penetration testing tools. Anyone who has tried to set up a pentesting box from scratch knows that getting everything working correctly can be a real pain. Having everything preconfigured in Kali can save a lot of time and headaches. Kali Linux works just like the standard Debian GNU/Linux distribution, with a lot of extra tools.

Rather than point and click your way through Kali, you’ll use the Linux command line because that’s where the real power lies. In this chapter, we’ll look at how to perform some common Linux tasks from the command line. If you’re already a Linux expert, you can skip this chapter and move on to Chapter 3. If not, take some time and dive in.

#### Linux Command Line
The Linux command line looks like this:
```
root@kali:~#
```
Like a DOS prompt or the Mac OS terminal, the Linux command line gives you access to a command processor called Bash that allows you to control the system by entering text-based instructions. When you open the command line, you’ll see the prompt `root@kali:#`. `Root` is the superuser, and `kali` is the hostname. The `#` indicates that you are logged in as the root user.
