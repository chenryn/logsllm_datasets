### 4. Related Work

The analysis framework introduced in Section 3 is generic and can be applied to outages detected by prior systems. This section focuses on efforts that study residential links and use active probes, while omitting discussions of approaches that infer outages from BGP activity [31, 34, 35, 61].

#### Residential Measurements
Behind-the-NAT residential network measurements can provide detailed information about events and precise location data. Examples include RIPE Atlas [49, 53], BISMark [19, 56], and SamKnows [9, 50], as well as host-based software such as DIMES [2], Dasu [51], and PeerMetric [37]. In contrast, our goal is to achieve broad coverage and detect rare weather-related outages, particularly for atypical link types used in rural deployments.

#### Internet Outage Detection with Active Probes
Chan et al. [11] studied undersea cable cuts using TCP measurements, noting that these widely reported outages visibly affect BGP routes. PlanetSeer [62] uses passive monitoring of wide-area traffic, not weather forecasts, to trigger active outside probing of hosts from PlanetLab nodes. Their findings, which show that 63% of outages occur within three hops of the edge of the network, motivate our work.

Paxson [45] surveyed outages using large-scale traceroutes to hosts, classifying route outages based on the number of consecutive failed traceroutes. Consecutive failures are common for residential link types (e.g., satellite), so we adopt a conservative definition of a dropout, requiring 11 minutes of no responses, missing a set of pings from different vantage points across that interval.

Zmap was used to investigate outages following Hurricane Sandy [16], but their proof-of-concept weather measurement was limited to three days of a well-forecast hurricane. Quan et al. [46] introduced “Trinocular” to analyze ping responses from a sample of hosts in every /24 (3.4M) in the IPv4 address space and also analyzed the effects of hurricanes [24]. Their approach considers the aggregated dropouts of a sample of a /24 prefix to represent a meaningful failure. We adopt parameters from their approach, such as the 11-minute safe probing interval and the use of at least three vantage points. Quan et al. note that studying individual addresses, as we do, may interpret customer-initiated events (e.g., turning off the access point) as failures. However, our approach assumes that such address-specific events are typically independent of weather (and thus controlled for by §3.2). If they occur in correlation with weather events, they are no less meaningful individually.

### 7. Conclusions

Using an eight-year dataset collected by probing residential IP addresses in the U.S., we demonstrated that various weather conditions can increase the likelihood of Internet dropouts. We quantified this inflation and showed that it varies depending on the type of weather, link type, and geographic location. We also found that the time to recover from a dropout increases during weather events.

Our datasets and analyses enable a wide range of future studies. We focused on the weather conditions that appeared in a prior study to have significant impacts on residential links [52], but our datasets span all weather reports. Therefore, our data support numerous other inquiries, such as the combined effects of wind speed and rain, the effects of cloud cover, and more. It is also possible to extend our analysis of recovery times, especially for link types like cable and satellite, where dynamic address reassignment is uncommon. For such link types, most recovery times measured by ThunderPing will be valid (as shown in Table 2), allowing additional inquiries into the geographic variation of recovery times during weather conditions and the relationship between the duration of a weather condition (such as gale-force winds or a thunderstorm) and recovery times. Our dataset, collected over 8 years (and counting), allows the analysis of longitudinal trends in dropouts across link types, geographic areas, and weather conditions. These analyses can answer questions about whether the deployment of new technologies in an area results in improved reliability.

In this study, we only investigated "dropout" events, which by definition constitute complete packet loss from three or more vantage points for at least 11 minutes. A promising avenue for future research is the study of how shorter events or partial failures are affected by weather. Another important area of future study is attributing root causes to dropouts under different weather conditions. Eto et al. [17] observed that residential U.S. homes experience approximately 1.5 power outages annually on average; we find considerably higher outage rates. While we cannot precisely compare two such disparate datasets, the large difference suggests that power outages are not the sole cause of dropouts.

To support researchers, network operators, and policymakers, we make our data and code publicly available at: https://thunderping.cs.umd.edu. This work does not raise any ethical issues.
