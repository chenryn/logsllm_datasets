### Infrastructure Indispensable for Education

Libraries are essential resources for students and researchers, providing both reference materials and research support. Metadata has been a fundamental component of library systems for centuries. The two most widely used general classification systems that utilize metadata are the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) systems.

- **Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC)**: This system categorizes subjects into 10 major categories, each with 10 secondary subjects.
- **Library of Congress Classification (LCC)**: This system uses letters to organize materials into 21 general branches of knowledge. These subject categories can be further divided into more specific areas by adding one or two additional letters and numbers.

### Transition to Digital Libraries

As traditional libraries increasingly transition to digital formats, new requirements have emerged. A key feature of digital libraries is the ability to efficiently browse electronic catalogues. This necessitates the use of common metadata to describe catalogue records (e.g., author, title, publisher) and common controlled vocabularies to assign subject identifiers to publications. 

The use of controlled vocabularies, thesauri, and taxonomies (Smrz, Sinopalnikova et al. 2003) enhances the search capabilities of digital libraries, ensuring that the most relevant information is returned. Semantically annotating the contents of a digital library's database goes beyond these tools, allowing for more meaningful retrieval of book records and bibliographic descriptions.

### Semantic Web Technologies

Semantic Web technologies, such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language), provide a common interchange format for catalogue metadata and shared vocabularies. This is crucial because many library systems are based on various metadata formats, often created for specific purposes. By publishing ontologies, libraries can ensure that all users across the Web use the same vocabularies for cataloguing, thereby simplifying the task of interoperability between different digital library systems (Shum, Motta et al. 2000).

### Semantic Grid

The concept of the Grid (Foster and Kesselman 1999) has been proposed as a fundamental computing infrastructure to support e-Science. The Grid enables the sharing of computer power and data storage capacity over the Internet, extending beyond simple communication to include functionalities for the rapid assembly and disassembly of services into temporary groups.

Recently, the Grid has evolved into the Semantic Grid, which aims to create an intelligent platform for process automation, knowledge sharing, and collaboration within communities (Roure, Jennings et al. 2001). The Semantic Grid leverages semantic Web technologies to describe information, computing resources, and services in standard ways that can be processed by computers. Resources and services are represented using RDF, and the use of semantics for locating data involves a two-step process: first, searching metadata catalogues to find the required resources, and second, accessing or invoking the data or service.

### Semantic Web Search

Swoogle (Swoogle 2005) is a crawler-based indexing and retrieval system for the semantic Web, built on top of the Google API. Developed by the Ebiquity research group at the University of Maryland, Swoogle indexes Semantic Web Documents (SWD) written in RDF and OWL, rather than plain HTML documents. It extracts metadata from discovered documents, computes relationships among them, and defines an ontology ranking property similar to Google's pageRank (Brin and Page 1998). Swoogle provides query interfaces and services to Web users, supporting software agents, programs via service interfaces, and researchers working in the semantic Web area.

### Semantic Bioinformatics Systems

The integration of information sources in the life sciences is a significant challenge in bioinformatics (Kumar and Smith 2004). The Gene Ontology (GO) is a notable achievement in this field, aiming to ensure consistent descriptions of gene products in different databases. GO is rapidly becoming a de facto standard for gene and gene product annotations, with over 17,000 terms organized into three hierarchies: molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes (Bodenreider, Aubry et al. 2005).

Another important life science ontology is the Microarray Gene Expression Data (MGED) ontology, which provides standardized terms for the annotation of microarray experiments (MGED 2005). These terms enable structured queries and facilitate the comparison of different experiments. The adoption of common standards by the research community is essential for the development of systems for managing, storing, transferring, mining, and sharing microarray data (Stoeckert, Causton et al. 2002).

### Conclusions

Since its creation, the World Wide Web has allowed computers to understand Web page layout for display purposes but not their intended meaning. The semantic Web aims to enrich the existing Web with a layer of machine-understandable metadata, enabling automatic processing of information by computer programs. The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) has been actively working on defining open standards such as RDF and OWL, and promoting their use in both industry and academia. These standards are crucial for the integration and interoperability of intra- and inter-business processes, particularly in the context of business-to-business and business-to-customer infrastructures.

The semantic Web not only describes Web resources for machine-to-machine exchange but also allows for reasoning by inference. Once resources are described using facts, associations, and relationships, inference engines can derive new knowledge and draw logical conclusions from existing information. Although the semantic Web is still in its early stages, there are already applications and tools that use this approach to build semantic Web-based systems, ranging from semantic Web services and tourism information integration to bioinformatics ontologies.
