**Why is This Important?**

#### Scenarios:
- **Chemical Spraying Malfunction:** A hacker could program sprayers to unevenly apply chemicals, resulting in ten times the chemical on some parts of the field and only a tenth on others. This can lead to crop damage and environmental hazards.

#### Risks:
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A DoS attack on agricultural systems can have a significant impact, disrupting operations and causing financial losses.
- **GPS Manipulation:** A hacker could upload a firmware update that introduces an offset into the GPS locations used by the equipment. For example, an offset of 100 yards north could cause the equipment to navigate onto a highway, into a river, through a fence, or over a cliff, leading to the destruction of the equipment.

**Real Threats:**
- Conor Cagney's article: [Leaky John Deere APIs and Serious Food Supply Chain Vulnerabilities](https://sick.codes/leaky-john-deere-apis-serious-food-supply-chain-vulnerabilities-discovered-by-sick-codes-kevin-kenney-willie-cade/#comment-41658)

**Why Did We Look at Agriculture?**
- No one else was focusing on this area.

**Team Members:**
- **Willie Cade**: Grandson of Theo Brown, who served on the John Deere Board for 30 years.
- **Kevin Kenney**: 
  - Nebraska
  - Engineer and Farmer
  - Photographer: Walker Pickering for Bloomberg Businessweek

**Precision Agriculture:**
- Every farm is connected via various communication technologies such as 5G, LTE, 2G/3G, LoRa, WiFi, GPS, GPRS, WAAS, RTK, and NTRIP.

**Data Usage:**
- **Trade Secrets:** Sharing data with data analytics providers may not destroy its secrecy if done anonymously. [More on this topic](https://www.aglaw.us/janzenaglaw/2015/9/30/is-farm-data-a-trade-secret)
- **Biofuel and Carbon Credits:** Data is also used for carbon credits in both mandatory and voluntary markets.
