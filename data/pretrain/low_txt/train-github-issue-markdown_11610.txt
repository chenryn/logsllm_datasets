Under Firefox 7, the Models JS library occasionally fails to clear the backdrop properly when the "Launch Model" button is rapidly clicked with the left mouse button. I have also been able to reproduce this issue on the Bootstrap demo site.

I am reporting this issue now and will investigate it further tonight.
