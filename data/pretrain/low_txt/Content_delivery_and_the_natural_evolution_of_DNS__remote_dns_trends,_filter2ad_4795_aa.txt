## Abstract

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) rely on the Domain Name System (DNS) for replica server selection. This process assumes that the location of a client’s DNS resolver is a good approximation of the client’s actual network location. However, the recent growth of remote DNS services challenges this assumption and can negatively impact web performance.

In this paper, we assess the end-to-end impact of using remote DNS services on CDN performance and present the first evaluation of an industry-proposed solution to this problem. We find that remote DNS usage can significantly degrade web performance and that the proposed solution, if available, can effectively address the issue for most clients. Given the performance cost of remote DNS usage and the limited adoption of the industry-proposed solution, we introduce and evaluate an alternative approach, Direct Resolution, which can achieve comparable performance improvements without requiring participation from CDNs or DNS providers.

## 1. Introduction

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) replicate content across geographically distributed servers and redirect clients to nearby replicas to reduce web access time. Since their emergence in the mid-1990s, CDNs have become the primary method for distributing content over the Internet. According to Alexa.com, 74% of the top 1,000 sites and 89% of their pageviews use CDNs (Figure 2). The CDN industry has grown to include over 49 companies, ranging from regional-focused ones like Accelia to global services such as Akamai and Level3.

CDNs rely on DNS for both dynamic request routing and replica server selection. For server selection, CDNs base their decision on the IP address of a client’s local DNS resolver, assuming that the resolver's location approximates the client’s network location. The recent growth in remote DNS usage challenges this assumption.

This paper investigates the impact of the evolution of DNS on the web experience of end users. Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the use of remote DNS services, including public DNS. These services offer several potential advantages, such as better DNS performance, availability, and security. OpenDNS, for example, reported a 2× increase in users from 2010 to 2012. In our own survey based on data from the EdgeScope project, we found that the public DNS user base has grown by 27% annually over the last 21 months, with 8.6% of users relying on a public DNS service as of December 2011.

While remote DNS services can improve DNS performance, they may also result in worse end-to-end web performance by breaking the assumptions made by CDN mapping approaches. To illustrate this, we compare the minimum time to fetch content from Akamai’s CDN using local and remote DNS servers in different locations in North America. Figure 1 shows that remote DNS, both public and far-away ISP DNS, can significantly increase CDN access latency, doubling it in the median case and tripling it for the worst 10% of locations.

We introduce Direct Resolution (DR), an alternative solution that achieves comparable performance improvements to the DNS extension. Our end-host solution enables incremental adoption by affected users and does not require support from DNS services or CDNs. DR leverages the cache of an end host’s recursive resolver to map a Canonical Name (CNAME) to an authoritative name server, but directly contacts the authoritative server to obtain a precise redirection for the client. We have implemented DR as part of namehelp, a tool based on a popular DNS benchmark utility, to provide a comparative evaluation of DNS service and web performance and act as a DNS proxy that implements DR to improve CDN mappings. Using DR for all CDN queries improves end-to-end performance for 49% of locations, and namehelp avoids penalties by only using DR when it has previously improved performance.

## 2. Background

Since their emergence in the mid-1990s, CDNs have become the primary method for delivering content over the Internet. To estimate the reliance of popular sites on CDNs, we conducted a survey of the top 1,000 most popular sites, as ranked by Alexa.com. For each site, we downloaded its index page and linked web objects, using techniques such as HTTP redirection to CDN domains or CNAME entries in DNS resolutions. These results are a lower bound on the use of CDNs in popular sites.

Figure 1 plots the minimum latency for different locations using nearby (latency <50 ms) and faraway ISP DNS and Google DNS. Web access latency is a significant factor in user satisfaction. As the figure shows, remote DNS—both public DNS and far-away ISP DNS—has a major impact on CDN access latency. Latency doubles in the median case and triples for the worst 10% of locations. These results extend and are consistent with those in Ager et al. [1]; we find that a large fraction of ISPs’ DNS services, as much as 27%, are distant from their users, resulting in significant reductions in CDN performance.

In this paper, we present results from a large-scale study of the end-to-end impact of remote DNS usage on CDN performance. Based on experiments conducted from 10,923 end-hosts across 99 countries, we show that for 90% of the sampled locations, the set of CDN replicas selected based on public DNS services has no overlap with those selected based on the client location. This error results in a 60% increase in end-to-end latency in the median case and up to a 3× increase for 20% of the sampled locations.

The potential negative impact of remote DNS usage on web performance motivates the recently proposed edns-client-subnet EDNS0 extension [3]. This extension, put forward by a collaboration of several CDNs and DNS service providers [28], allows DNS recursive resolvers to pass along clients’ subnet information that could be used by CDNs to improve replica server selection. A key challenge to this approach is adoption, as it requires the commitment of both CDN and DNS services to be effective. We report on the first study of the adoption of the proposed edns-client-subnet extension and its potential benefits for public DNS service users. We find that the proposed extension could be effective at reducing the impact of public DNS usage on CDN performance. Our results show that, assuming wide adoption, the proposed extension can reduce the impact of public DNS usage to less than 80% for 80% of locations (30%).

Figure 2 summarizes our findings. The figure plots both the fraction of "Sites" (blue/dark) and "Pageviews" (green/light) using CDNs in the top N most popular sites. All sites in the top 10 and over 70% of those in the top 1,000 rely on CDNs. Weighting CDN use by pageviews results in an even larger fraction of top sites using CDNs. Across all views to the top 1,000 sites—accounting for 48% of all pageviews—9 out of 10 require loading objects from a CDN.

For a web client to retrieve content for a web page, the first step is to use DNS to resolve the server-name portion of the content’s URL into the address of a machine hosting it. If the web site uses a CDN, the content will be replicated at several hosts across the Internet. A popular way to direct clients to those replicas dynamically is DNS redirection. With DNS redirection, a client’s DNS request is redirected to an authoritative DNS name server controlled by the CDN, which then resolves the CDN server name to the IP address of one or more replica servers [13]. DNS redirection can be used to deliver full or partial site content. With the former, all DNS requests for the origin server are redirected to the CDN. With partial site content delivery, the origin site modifies certain embedded URLs so that requests for only those URLs are redirected to the CDN. CDNs typically select a (set of) replica to serve the request from based on the network and geographic region of the local DNS server. While a reasonable approximation when clients and their local DNS resolvers are topologically close, the use of remote DNS services can yield less than optimal redirections.

Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the use of remote DNS services, including public DNS. To analyze longitudinal trends in remote DNS usage, we use 21 months of user DNS configuration data from the EdgeScope project (April 2010 through December 2011). EdgeScope [5] collects data from BitTorrent [32] users, including host configuration and host and network measurement statistics. The dataset includes information reported by 47,119 users located in 197 countries and 4,613 ASes, giving us a diverse and global perspective on DNS usage by BitTorrent users.

We quantify public DNS adoption by counting the users having configured well-known IP addresses for these services at different points over the observed period. Figure 3 shows the observed trends in combined (labeled Any) and individual public DNS service adoption for the three most popular: Google, OpenDNS, and Level3. Overall, we found that public DNS usage is growing by 27% annually.
