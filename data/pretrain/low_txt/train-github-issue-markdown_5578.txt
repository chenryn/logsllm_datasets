When certain actions result in the creation of new files in the workspace, we should adhere to the auto-save settings. If auto-save is enabled, the file should be saved to disk immediately. If auto-save is disabled, the file should remain unsaved and display an unsaved icon until manually saved.

**Summary:**
- Ensure that `"files.autoSave": "afterDelay"` is set in your user settings.
- Open a new folder in the code editor.
- Create and open a `hello.js` file.
- Wait for the green lightbulb to appear in the bottom right corner, then click it and choose to create a `jsconfig.json` file.

The newly created `jsconfig.json` file will not be automatically saved. Instead, it will display the unsaved icon and wait for you to save it manually.
