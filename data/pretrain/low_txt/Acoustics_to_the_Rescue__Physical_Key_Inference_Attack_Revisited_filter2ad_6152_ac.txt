### Figure 11: Overall Performance Comparison
- **Description:** The figure depicts the overall performance comparing the Video-only pool-size vs. Keynergy (Video + Acoustics) rank.

### Figure 12: Acoustics-only Approach Performance
- **Description:** The figure shows the performance of the Acoustics-only approach.

### Experimental Setup
- **Distance from Door:** 5ft up to 25ft away.
- **Locations:** University’s lecture hall, multipurpose room, and dormitory room.
- **Total Keys:** 78 keys (75 for testing, 3 for training).
- **Trials per Key:** 10-12 insertions.
- **Total Insertions:** Over 3,600 insertions.
- **Participants:** 13 participants over three months.
- **Ethical Compliance:** Adhered to the university’s Institutional Review Board (IRB).

### Performance Metrics
- **Key Rank (Rankkey):** Rank of each key in the keyspace from Keynergy’s attack. A higher ranked key (e.g., Rank 1) is more likely to match the victim’s key.
- **Keyspace Reduction Ratio (RatioReduction):** Fraction of keys in the keyspace that yield lower ranks than the victim key’s rank. For example, if the victim’s key is predicted as Rank 10, then RatioReduction = \(\frac{59,207 - 10}{59,207} \approx 0.999\).
- **Search Pool Size (Poolsearch):** Reduced key search space from video analysis. Keys within the pool are equally likely to be the victim key.

### 6.2 Attack Performance
- **Key Set:** 74 different Schlage SC1 keys (out of 75, one filtered out due to lack of distinct clusters).
- **Data Collection:** Audio collected from a single participant inserting all 74 keys for ten trials per key in a dormitory room with a microphone located 1ft away from the door setup.

#### 6.2.1 Overall Attack Accuracy
- **Results:** Combined audio and visual information for reducing keyspace (Figure 11).
  - **Keynergy (Video + Acoustics):** Average keyspace reduction of 63 with 92% recall (σ = 47). Smallest and largest average ranks are 1 and 206, respectively, with six keys achieving an average rank below 10 across ten iterations.
  - **Video-only Approach:** Average keyspace reduction of 166 keys (with a recall of 92% (σ = 62), ranging from 15 to 242 keys).
  - **Improvement:** Keynergy achieves around 62% improvement over the Video-only approach on average.

#### 6.2.2 Acoustics-only Attack Accuracy
- **Results:** Evaluated using the sorted RatioReduction on all 74 keys (Figure 12).
  - **Average Reduction Rate:** 75%, with 87% of keys (65 keys) achieving more than 50% reduction.
  - **Average Rankkey:** Around 14,835, with the highest rank of 119.
  - **Conclusion:** Acoustics alone are useful but insufficient for a practical attack. Keynergy combines audio and video modalities to achieve high reduction ratios (> 99%).

### 6.3 Modules Evaluation
- **Evaluation of Different Modules:** Justification of model parameters.

#### 6.3.1 Click and Cluster Detection Performance
- **Setup:** Audio recordings from the university’s lecture hall. Three participants inserted three keys (different from the 75 keys) with twelve trials per key, totaling 108 key insertions.
- **Onset Detection Techniques:**
  - **Weighted Flux:** Captures differences in high-frequency energies.
  - **Superflux:** Captures energy differences and is robust to signal fluctuations in frequency and loudness.
  - **High Frequency Content:** Captures high-frequency energies.
  - **K-Means Clustering:** Identifies unique spectral energy distribution around click onsets.
- **Spectrogram Window Size:** Fixed at 127 (about 0.66 ms) with a 75% overlap between windows.
- **Ground Truth:** Manually annotated clicks and their corresponding clusters.

##### Cluster Detection
- **Accuracy:** Weighted Flux technique yields the highest cluster detection accuracy of 78.7% across all clusters and 94.4% across the last three clusters.
- **Design Parameters:** Amplitude threshold of 0.15 and a minimum duration between adjacent clicks of 4 time windows (0.66 ms).

##### Click Detection Refinement
- **Accuracy:** Weighted-flux technique yields the highest refinement accuracy for all three clusters with 80.8%, 77.3%, and 73.1%, respectively.
- **Design Parameters:** Prominence threshold of 0.2 and a minimum duration between adjacent clicks of 5 time windows (0.83 ms).

### Figure 14: Contributing Rank of Cluster–Error Pairs
- **Description:** The figure depicts the contributing rank of cluster–error pairs and each cluster, where a lower contributing rank implies a higher contribution towards the final Rankkey.
