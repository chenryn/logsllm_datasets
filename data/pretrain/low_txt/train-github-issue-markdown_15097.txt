When running the `services/isolate.dart` sample application on a Nexus 5X and clicking the _Start_ button, the app crashes immediately. The following is the output from the terminal:

```bash

For reference, here is the output of my `flutter doctor` command:

```bash
$ flutter doctor

The app crashes with an unhandled exception, and the error message indicates a handle check failure. The `flutter doctor` output shows that all dependencies are correctly configured.
