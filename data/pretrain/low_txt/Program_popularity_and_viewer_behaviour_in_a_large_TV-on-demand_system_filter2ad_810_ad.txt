### Observations
1. **High Cacheability and Caching Potential:**
   - The cacheability and potential for caching are very high.
   - A simple LRU replacement policy achieves a hit ratio above 50% when caching 5% of the average daily demand.

2. **Prime Time Performance:**
   - The hit ratio increases during prime time, when it is needed most, consistent with the higher share of requests for popular programs during this period.

### Related Work
- **IPTV Systems:**
  - Cha et al. [8] and Qiu et al. [17, 18] study viewing behavior and channel popularity in IPTV systems.
  - Our work focuses on TV-on-Demand, where viewers choose programs outside the TV schedule.

- **VoD Systems:**
  - Yu et al. [26] study user behavior and content access patterns in the Chinese PowerInfo VoD system.
  - Other studies include Griwodz et al. [12], Lou et al. [16], Tang et al. [19], and Avramova et al. [3].

- **Caching Strategies:**
  - Ager et al. [2] study cacheability for HTTP- and P2P-based applications.
  - Studies on caching in IPTV on-demand systems [1, 5, 20, 21, 23] use analytical models and simulations, while our work is based on real traces.

### Future Work
- **Advanced Caching Strategies:**
  - Develop more informed caching strategies using knowledge about access patterns and program popularity.
  - Consider the following:
    - **New Programs:** Give preference to new programs that receive immediate requests.
    - **Genre-Based Categorization:** Predict future requests by categorizing programs by genre.
    - **Prime Time Focus:** Ensure the right programs are in the cache during peak demand periods.

### Conclusions
- **Access Patterns:**
  - A small set of programs accounts for a large part of the requests, conforming to the Pareto principle.
  - Demand follows diurnal and weekly patterns with peaks on Friday and Saturday evenings.
  - News programs have a short lifespan, children’s programs are top-ranked in mornings and early evenings, and movie rentals are concentrated over weekends.

- **Novel Insights:**
  - The popularity of TV-on-Demand programs changes over time, and the share of requests for the most popular programs grows during prime time.
  - The cacheability is very high, and the cache hit ratio increases during prime time.

- **Impact:**
  - These observations can guide the design of future TV-on-Demand infrastructures.
