### Broadening and Enhancing Information for Reliable User Behavior Analysis

To better understand and predict user behavior, especially in the context of home users, research methodologies need to be expanded and refined. This will enable the provision of more reliable information about actual user actions, with a particular focus on the factors that influence decision-making. With such detailed insights, security measures can be both more automated and personalized, aligning with the individual's capabilities and perceptions. Additionally, these approaches can offer alternatives when users are inclined to engage in risky behaviors, such as downloading peer-to-peer (P2P) software or sharing personal information on social media platforms like Facebook. As Dhamija et al. [29] demonstrated, even experienced users can fall victim to deceptive practices.
