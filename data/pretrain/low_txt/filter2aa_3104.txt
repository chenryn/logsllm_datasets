7. Conclusion

## Where We Were
- Initially, there were numerous administrators in many environments, sometimes almost as many Domain Admins as users.
- This created a target-rich environment with multiple paths for exploitation.
- Traditional methods of administration were easy to attack and compromise due to admin credentials being available on workstations.

## Where We Are Now
- Organizations are gradually improving their defenses:
  - Limiting privileged rights
  - Reducing admin group membership
  - Restricting rights to only what is necessary
  - Limiting admin logon capability and location
  - Implementing Group Policy or user logon controls
- While these steps are positive, they do not fully address the issues with how administration is typically performed, which often still occurs from regular workstations.

## Blue Sharpens Red (& Vice Versa)
- If you rely on a standard playbook, be prepared for changes.
- Defenders are improving, and attackers must adapt.
- When the standard playbook fails, new strategies are required.

## Old-School AD Administration
- **Logon to workstation as an admin**:
  - Credentials stored in LSASS
- **RunAs on workstation**:
  - Use standard Microsoft MMC admin tools (e.g., "Active Directory Users & Computers")
  - Credentials stored in LSASS
- **RDP to Domain Controllers**:
  - Manage DCs
  - Credentials stored in LSASS on remote servers and keylogged locally.

## The New School of Administration
- **No RunAs on workstations with admin rights**.
- **RDP to Admin/Jump Server**:
  - Requires two-factor/multi-factor authentication.
  - AD Admin credential authentication may be limited to specific admin servers and DCs.

### Demo: Bloodhound
- **Exploiting Administrative Assumptions**:
  - **Read-Only Domain Controllers (RODCs)**: Often deployed and misconfigured.
  - **Sensitive Information**: Sometimes attributes contain passwords or other sensitive data.
  - **LDAP Calls to AD**: Determine systems authorized for admin logons and probe for enabled protocols (WMI, WSMan/PowerShell Remoting, etc.).

## Attacking Password Vaults
- **Password Vault Technology**:
  - Companies use password vaults (e.g., CyberArk, Thycotic SecretServer) to improve administrative security.
  - **Reconciliation Account**: Often a Domain Admin to bring accounts back into compliance.
- **Password Vault Management**:
  - Admin connects to the vault website and authenticates.
  - Admin receives a password for the DA account.
  - Admin is proxied via the webserver through RDP to an Admin server or DC.
- **Password Vault Weaknesses**:
  - Authentication to the vault webserver is typically with the admin’s user account.
  - Connection to the vault webserver doesn’t always require 2FA/MFA.
  - PV servers are often administered like any other server.
  - Network traffic can be sent to the PV server(s).

## Admin Servers
- **Jump (Admin) Servers**:
  - If admins are not using admin workstations, keylog for creds on admin’s workstation.
  - Discover potential remoting services (RDP, WMI, WinRM/PowerShell Remoting, PSExec, NamedPipe).
  - Compromising a Jump Server can lead to domain control.

### Hijacking the Admin/Jump Server
- **Get Admin on the server**:
  - Get SYSTEM
  - Run tscon.exe as SYSTEM to connect to any session without a password.
  - Example: Alexander Korznikov demonstrates using Sticky Keys and tscon to access an administrator RDP session without logging into the server.

## Red Forest
- **Red/Admin Forest Discovery**:
  - Check for one-way trusts where the production AD trusts another AD forest with Selective Authentication enabled.
  - Enumerate group membership of the domain Administrators group for groups in the other forest.

## The Latest “Best” Way to Admin AD & How to Get Around It
- **Admin Forest Deployment**:
  - Some organizations ignore the primary production AD since all administrators are in the Red Forest.
  - They often don’t fix all issues in the prod AD and forget about service accounts.
  - Target agents on Domain Controllers.
  - Identify systems connecting to DCs with privileged credentials (e.g., backup accounts).

## Recommendations
- **Conclusion**:
  - Most organizations have implemented some security measures, but it’s often not enough.
  - Some are successfully detecting pentest/red team engagements.
  - Summarize how to operate in more secure environments and what is needed.
  - Provide recommendations to customers to improve admin hygiene and security.
