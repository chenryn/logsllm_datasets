**Title: Themes and Highlights of the New Security Paradigms Workshop 2002**

**Authors:**
- Cristina Serban, AT&T Labs
- O. Sami Saydjari, SRI Computer Science Laboratory

**Abstract:**
This panel highlights a selection of the most interesting and provocative papers from the 2002 New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW). The workshop, held in September 2002, provided a forum for innovative approaches to computer security. The panel consists of authors of the selected papers and is moderated by the workshop’s general chairs. We will present papers that focus on major themes emerging from the workshop, aiming to provoke engaging discussions at ACSAC.

**Panel Theme:**
The panel presents a selection of the best, most interesting, and most provocative work from the ACM-sponsored New Security Paradigms Workshop 2002. For eleven years, NSPW has been a productive and highly interactive forum for new approaches to computer security. This year's workshop featured a record number of new security paradigms, reflecting the growing interest and research in the field.

NSPW is an invitational workshop with a deliberately small size to facilitate deep, meaningful discussions of new ideas. Authors are encouraged to present work that might be considered risky in other settings, and all participants are expected to provide constructive feedback. This brainstorming environment has proven to be an excellent medium for advancing visionary ideas.

Our philosophy is to seek significantly new paradigms and shifts from previous thinking, facilitating debate within a constructive environment of experienced researchers, practitioners, and newcomers to the field. In keeping with the NSPW philosophy, this panel challenges many of the dominant paradigms in information security. Expect it to be highly interactive, with lively exchanges between the panelists and the audience.

**Highlights of Recent Ideas:**
- **Defensive vs. Offensive Information Warfare:** The idea that defensive information warfare will always fail, and that offensive information warfare is necessary.
- **Optimistic Security:** An access control paradigm where, in certain situations (e.g., hospitals), users are permitted to violate standard access controls in the interests of safety.
- **Market Forces and Protection Profiles:** An examination of how market forces may drive the use of protection profiles in the Common Criteria.
- **Protocol Assumptions:** Enlarging protocol assumptions to include environment and context.
- **Reconsidering Information Security:** A case for rethinking our approach to information security from the ground up to effectively deal with information risk.
- **Definition of Old Paradigms:** A discussion on the nature and definition of old security paradigms, emphasizing the need to define them before considering the novelty of "new" ones.
- **Implementation-Independent Integrity Model:** A new system integrity model that is independent of implementation paradigms.
- **Downgrading with Decision Trees:** A new method of downgrading that uses decision trees to avoid the inference problem.
- **Application Defense and Host Disarming:** A new approach to helping applications defend themselves while disarming hosts via the use of filters.
- **Bug Tolerance:** A new paradigm called bug tolerance that enhances the survivability of flawed systems post hoc.

**Panel Format:**
The panel will consist of four authors of papers selected by the NSPW 2002 General and Program Chairs, and it will be chaired by the general chair. After the introductory remarks, each panelist will give a 10 to 15-minute presentation. The floor will then be opened for audience questions and discussions. This format has worked well in the past and will continue the tradition.

**Conclusion:**
Join us for this panel to discover the new paradigms of 2002! You’ll either immediately like or dislike them, and you’ll have the chance to express your thoughts.
