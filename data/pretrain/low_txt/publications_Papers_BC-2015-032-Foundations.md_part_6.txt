### 8. Information Enablers
Information enablers are resources that provide information and knowledge to support the system.

### 9. Environment
The system's environment includes all factors that can influence the system, such as physical, technological, social, and legal factors.

### CAIOPHYKE Taxonomy
The term "CAIOPHYKE" is derived from the first letters of the nine major classes in the taxonomy: Customers, Aims, Inputs, Outputs, Processes, Human Enablers, Physical Enablers, Information Enablers (Knowledge), and Environment. These nine major classes are extended to a second level with 75 main classes. At a third level, they are decomposed into 351 minor classes. The fourth and fifth levels include the actual attributes of a service and their possible values. A complete description of the various levels can be found in [55, page 264].

#### Example — CAIOPHYKE
- **Major Class: Customer**
  - **Main Class: Customer Features**
    - **Minor Class: Age**
      - **Attribute: Age of Customers**
        - **Possible Values: Children, Teenagers, Adults**

The major, main, and minor classes identify aspects of service systems that can be analyzed to understand how a service is built and structured, for example, to increase its transparency and highlight areas for improvement.

### Key Terms

- **Service-Dominant Logic**: A theory that views service as the focus of economic and social exchange.
- **Service**: A change in the condition of a person or a good belonging to some economic unit, brought about as a result of the activity of another economic unit, with the prior agreement of the former person or economic unit.

### Capstone Model
| Major Classes | Main Classes | Minor Classes |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Customers** | Customer Organization | Customer Features | Customer Associations | Customer Attitudes |
| **Aims** | Strategic Goals (General) | Strategic Goals (Service) | Service Goals | Customer Goals |
| **Inputs** | Physical Factors | Human Factors | Demand Factors | Utilization Factors |
| **Outputs** | Physical Factors | Human Factors | Informatics | Financial Factors |
| **Processes** | Service Configuration | Service Variability | Service Initiation | Service Provision |
| **Human Enablers** | Owner Organization (Enterprise) | Service Providers | Support Providers | Employee Management |
| **Physical Enablers** | Service Center (Physical) | Facilities (Primary Services) | Amenities (Supplementary Services) | Equipment |
| **Informatic Enablers** | Product/Service Information | Promotion | Official Documentation | Product Configuration |
| **Environment** | Market Factors | Geographic Factors | Economic Factors | Technological Factors |

### Table 1.3: The Capstone Model
[55] proposed by Kaner and Karni to conceptualize service systems.

### I-T-O Model
A basic concept from operations management that represents a service as a transformation (T) process that takes inputs (I), transforms and adds value to them, and provides outputs (O) for customers.

### Self-Service
A service provided with minimal or no human involvement on the provider's side. The provider often sets up facilities or equipment that the customer can use to perform a certain task.

### Knowledge-Intensive Services
Services that heavily rely on professional knowledge.

### IHIP
An acronym for four concepts often used to characterize services: Intangibility (I), Heterogeneity (H), Inseparability (I), and Perishability (P).

### Demand Aggregation
An approach from demand management that aggregates loads with different demand patterns to take advantage of statistical effects that reduce variability in the aggregated demand.

### Demand Conditioning
An approach from demand management that creates artificial incentives for customers to use services during off-peak periods.

### Outsourcing
A strategy that many companies follow to turn fixed costs into variable costs by paying for services only on demand, thus avoiding risks if the company’s business fluctuates.

### Servitization
A strategy where a company adds services to existing core products, resulting in a hybrid offering where products and services are integrated as one bundle.
