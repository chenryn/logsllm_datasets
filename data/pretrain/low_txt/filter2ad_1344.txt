## Abstract
The need for privacy-aware policies, regulations, and techniques has been widely recognized. This workshop addresses the challenges of privacy in global, interconnected societies and explores potential solutions. The 2012 Workshop, held in conjunction with the ACM CCS conference, is the eleventh in a series of annual forums dedicated to discussing all aspects of privacy in today's electronic society.

## 1. Scope
An increasing portion of our daily activities are mediated by computers, leading to a multitude of potential privacy issues. It is becoming easier to collect, exchange, access, process, and link information. Privacy concerns have become a subject of public debate, and the need for privacy-aware policies, regulations, and techniques has been widely recognized.

Since its inception in 2002, the workshop has aimed to bring together researchers from academia and industry to discuss both theoretical and practical aspects of electronic privacy, as well as experimental studies of deployed systems. Over the years, privacy-related research has seen significant growth and can be found in top conferences across various fields, including databases, networking, and cyber-physical systems. The workshop takes a cross-disciplinary approach to privacy, bringing together experts from different communities and presenting perspectives from policy, law, and business on technological issues.

This year, submissions were solicited on the following topics:
- Anonymity, pseudonymity, and unlinkability
- Data privacy
- Economics of privacy
- Electronic commerce privacy
- Health information privacy
- Identity management
- Location privacy
- Personally identifiable information
- Privacy and anonymity in the Web
- Privacy and confidentiality management
- Privacy and data mining
- Privacy and human rights
- Privacy-enhancing technologies
- Privacy in health care and public administration
- Privacy in mobile computing
- Privacy in pervasive and ubiquitous computing
- Privacy in social networks
- Privacy in cloud systems
- Privacy in electronic records
- Privacy metrics
- Privacy policies
- Privacy threats
- Privacy vs. security
- Privacy-aware access control
- Privacy-preserving computation
- Public records and personal privacy
- Traffic analysis
- Unobservability

## 2. Papers
The workshop received 48 submissions, of which 47 were compliant with the Call for Papers (CFP). The program committee selected 11 papers for full presentation and 3 papers for short presentation. The goal was to balance the selection of high-quality contributions with the opportunity to present early, innovative ideas that would stimulate discussion and further research. The accepted papers cover a diverse range of topics:

- **Anonymous Communications:** A traditional topic for WPES, with 3 papers addressing this subject.
- **Online Behavioral Advertising:** 3 papers address various aspects of user tracking and privacy impacts.
- **User Privacy Expectations:** Several papers study user expectations, evaluate the usability of tools, highlight privacy risks, and help users understand policies.
- **Privacy-Enhancing Technologies:** Papers propose new technologies for privacy-preserving genomic tests, enabling old data to disappear from the Internet, facilitating censorship circumvention, and protecting sensitive text from automated analysis.

### 2.1 Ethics
This year, the committee faced the issue of research ethics in evaluating a paper that collected potentially sensitive user data. While ethical treatment of research subjects is well-established in medical research, it is a relatively new concern in computational sciences. In recent years, there has been growing attention to research ethics, with position papers, panel discussions, and entire workshops dedicated to the topic. As a workshop focused on privacy, the committee felt that WPES should maintain high standards of publication and require that research adheres to principles of risk minimization, beneficence, and informed consent. The committee decided not to accept the paper in question, as it did not sufficiently adhere to these principles. The committee also emphasized the importance of continuing the conversation on research ethics within the community, possibly including guidelines in future calls for papers.

## 3. Organization
The workshop is chaired by Nikita Borisov, an associate professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His research interests include online privacy, network security, and Internet-scale distributed systems. The program committee is composed of:

- Rafael Accorsi, University of Freiburg
- Sherman S.M. Chow, University of Waterloo
- Anupam Datta, Carnegie Mellon University
- Sabrina De Capitani di Vimercati, University of Milan

## 4. Acknowledgments
