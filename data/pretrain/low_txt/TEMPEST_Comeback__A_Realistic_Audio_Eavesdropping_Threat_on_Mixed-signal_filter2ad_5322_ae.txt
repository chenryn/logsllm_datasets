### Mitigation Techniques for Unintended Electromagnetic Emissions

#### 1. Shielding and Filtering
One effective method to reduce unintended electromagnetic (EM) emissions is the use of shielding and filtering techniques. Shielding involves enclosing the device in a conductive or magnetic material to block EM radiation. Common shielding materials include metals, conductive fabrics, and composite materials [15].

Another approach is to apply line-filters to the signal and power lines connected to Multi-System-on-Chips (MSoCs). These filters can significantly reduce leaked radiation, as the primary sources of EM emissions are often the external lines connected to MSoCs. Special attention should be given to long physical electrical lines within the product, as they can act as radiative antennas. However, it is important to note that these blocking techniques may have limited effectiveness and are not always sufficient.

#### 2. Avoidance of Switching Regulators (SWREG)
As shown in Figure 9(b), SWREGs can substantially increase unwanted EM emissions. Therefore, using Linear Dropout Regulators (LDOs) instead of SWREGs in MSoCs is a better choice from a security perspective. However, LDOs are less efficient than SWREGs and can significantly shorten battery life in battery-powered systems, as demonstrated in Table 1.

We recommend that MSoC manufacturers provide a mixed or cascaded structure, rather than mutually exclusive regulator options. This allows customers to choose a suitable power supply module based on the trade-off between efficiency and EM emission reduction. Experimental results suggest that a hybrid approach may offer an alternative to using a single SWREG.

#### 3. Reduction of SWREG Noise
One potential approach to mitigate EM emissions is to reduce the switching noise in the design stage of SWREGs. A promising technique is the spur-free switching method, which changes a switching parameter over time to avoid the accumulation of single-frequency switching effects. Typically, this involves varying the phases of the switching frequencies [29, 45, 46]. In [29], the authors demonstrated that periodic frequency spurs in SWREGs could be fully eliminated, regardless of the operating conditions or actual switching frequency.

#### 4. Reduction of Substrate Coupling
Reducing substrate coupling is a long-term but highly effective solution. This involves minimizing unintentional EM emissions during the chip design stage. Key strategies include:
- **Cautious Signal Design:** Reducing coupling sources such as clock and SWREG noises [2, 5, 7, 27].
- **Mixed-Signal Circuit Design:** Implementing techniques like separating analog and digital grounds, activating guard-band filtering, and eliminating loop paths [2, 7].
- **System in Package (SiP):** Using SiP can be a good alternative to SoC. Although the size may increase slightly, it can significantly reduce substrate coupling by separating digital, analog, and power substrates in a package [7, 48].

### Conclusions
In this paper, we have demonstrated a new TEMPEST threat based on the SWREG noise, which emanates strong, unintended audio signals. Our experiments with various recent commercial devices verified the realism of this threat, showing that intelligible information can be successfully reconstructed at practical distances. We also demonstrated the feasibility of the attack on a digital I2C interface.

The experimental results indicate that this threat is more prominent than known threats due to:
- **Higher Attack Availability:** A large number of frequency resources from several MHz to over 1 GHz are available.
- **Lower Attack Difficulty:** Recently introduced Software-Defined Radio (SDR) platforms can be used as low-cost, high-sensitivity receivers.

The experimental setup consisted of readily available commercial devices and antennas. However, national intelligence agencies may already possess or be able to acquire more sophisticated receiver systems, which could naturally increase the attack distance.

### Appendix A: EM Wave Radiation and Coupling Mechanisms

#### A.1 Carrier Coupling
Electromagnetic (EM) emanations from electronic devices can be classified into "direct emission (DE)" and "carrier coupling emission (CCE)." Figure 17 shows the time signal and the frequency spectrum of DE and CCE, respectively.

- **Direct Emission (DE):** DE can be explained by Maxwell's equations, where an EM wave is caused by the time-varying current flow of a circuit. DE is typically radiated at a low-frequency band because the original signal is generated in the baseband. As a result, the detectable distance at a receiver is usually only a few centimeters.
- **Carrier Coupling Emission (CCE):** When a carrier signal with its frequency (𝑓𝑐), such as a clock, is coupled to the baseband signal, CCE is radiated in the form of amplitude or angle modulation. Non-ideal and non-linear circuits generate harmonic components at 𝑛 × 𝑓𝑐 frequencies, where 𝑛 is an integer. The signal power decreases sharply as 𝑛 increases. As shown in Figure 17, the spectral powers of CCE signals are generally stronger than those of DE, indicating that CCE signals can be radiated over a longer distance, making them more attractive to EM attackers.

#### A.2 Carrier Inter-modulation & Coupling
If there are two strong carriers with different frequencies (𝑓𝑐1 and 𝑓𝑐2) where (𝑓𝑐1 > 𝑓𝑐2) in a circuit, the frequency spectrum of the signal emission appears as shown in Figure 18. The radiated frequency (𝑓𝑅𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛) can be expressed as:

\[ f_{\text{Radiation}} = n \cdot f_{c1} + m \cdot f_{c2}, \]
where \( n, m = 0, \pm1, \pm2, \ldots \)

For large values of \( n \) and \( m \), no emission may be observed because the radiated power decreases below the noise floor. Carrier inter-modulation and coupling are characterized by multiple emission signals over a wide-frequency band, depending on the frequencies of the two carriers.
