## Abstract

Since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect in May 2018, online services are required to obtain users' explicit consent before sharing their personal data with third parties that use the data for their own purposes. While violations of this requirement on the web have been extensively studied, there is a lack of insight into such violations in the mobile ecosystem.

We conducted the first large-scale measurement on Android apps to understand the current state of GDPR's explicit consent violations. Specifically, we developed a semi-automated pipeline to detect data sent to the Internet without prior consent and applied it to a dataset of 86,163 Android apps. We collaborated with a legal scholar to assess if the domains receiving data protected under the GDPR are third-party data controllers. Our findings indicate that 24,838 apps send personal data to data controllers without the user’s explicit prior consent.

To understand the reasons behind these violations, we ran a notification campaign to inform affected developers and gathered insights from their responses. We then conducted an in-depth analysis of violating apps and the corresponding third parties' documentation and privacy policies. Based on the responses and our analysis, we derived concrete recommendations for all involved entities in the ecosystem to help data subjects exercise their fundamental rights and freedoms.

## 1. Introduction

The increasing data collection and tracking by the online advertising industry pose significant risks to individuals' rights regarding their personal data. Regulatory efforts, such as the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), mandate that online services disclose how they handle personal data and grant users crucial data protection rights.

In mobile apps, researchers have analyzed app privacy policies to identify legislative violations. However, under the GDPR, an app must obtain users' explicit consent before sharing personal data with third parties if such parties use the data for their own purposes. The GDPR requires consent to be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Personal data transfer must only occur after the user has actively agreed, and "consent" packaged in terms and conditions or privacy policies is not compliant.

While many studies have focused on detecting and analyzing consent notices (i.e., cookie banners) on the web, there is limited research on such violations in the mobile ecosystem. Recent surveys of app developers suggest that most changes made due to GDPR are cosmetic, raising questions about the validity of these consents. Figure 1 shows examples of consent dialogues in Android apps, highlighting that neither (a) nor (b) are valid, and even (c) is meaningless if data sharing occurs before the user can reject it.

To understand the prevalence of GDPR's explicit consent violations in mobile apps, we conducted a study with 86,613 Android apps available through the German Play Store. We built a semi-automated and scalable pipeline to detect personal data sent to the Internet without prior consent. We found that 24,838 apps sent personal data to advertisement providers without the user’s explicit prior consent. To inform developers and understand the reasons behind these issues, we ran a notification campaign, gathering insights from 448 responses. Our analysis revealed that GDPR issues are widespread, often misunderstood, and require collaborative efforts from advertisement providers, app stores, and developers to mitigate.

## 2. Research Questions and Legal Background

### 2.1 Context of Our Work

Recent research has focused on the impact of GDPR on the online advertising and tracking industry, with studies proposing techniques to detect legislative violations. While much work has been done on consent notices and their impact on web advertising, no study has measured GDPR violations of explicit consent in mobile apps. For mobile apps, researchers have primarily focused on analyzing app privacy policies to identify legislative violations.

### 2.2 Legal Background

#### 2.2.1 Definition of Personal Data

Under the GDPR, "personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. This includes unique identification numbers, location data, and online identifiers (such as IP addresses) when they can be used to identify users over a long period across different apps and services. The definition is broader than personal identifiable data (PII) under US laws, as it also considers data that can be used alone or in combination to single out an individual in a dataset.

#### 2.2.2 Legal Basis for Processing of Personal Data

Under the GDPR, all processing of European residents' personal data must have a legal justification. App developers (first parties) act as data controllers, responsible for data processing. Third parties that receive user data can act as either data processors (processing data on behalf of the first party) or data controllers (using data for their own purposes). The GDPR provides six general justifications for processing, including consent, contract fulfillment, legal obligation, and legitimate interests. In practice, most advertising companies rely on consent or legitimate interests. However, a recent study shows that data subjects often do not fully understand the extent of data sharing and its purposes, making it unlikely that legitimate interests outweigh the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. Therefore, many ad tech companies would likely need to rely on explicit consent.

### 2.3 Research Questions

- **RQ1:** How many apps send out personal data without any prior consent?
- **RQ2:** Of the apps that send data, how many send it to parties that act as data controllers under the GDPR?
- **RQ3:** Are developers aware of the requirements of GDPR and the issues that might arise from not following the outlined laws?

## 3. Methodology

Our main goal was to develop a mostly automated and scalable solution to detect personal data sent to the Internet by analyzing network traffic generated by apps without user explicit prior consent. We applied this to a dataset of 86,163 Android apps, both high-profile and long-tail. We collaborated with a legal scholar to assess the extent to which contacted domains are third-party data controllers. We found that 24,838 apps sent personal data to advertisement providers without the user’s explicit prior consent. To inform developers and understand the reasons behind these issues, we ran a notification campaign, gathering insights from 448 responses. Our analysis revealed that GDPR issues are widespread, often misunderstood, and require collaborative efforts from all stakeholders to mitigate.

## 4. Large-Scale Measurement

We performed a large-scale measurement on mobile apps to understand the current state of GDPR's explicit consent violations. Our semi-automated pipeline detected personal data sent to the Internet without prior consent. We found that 24,838 apps sent personal data to advertisement providers without the user’s explicit prior consent. This highlights the need for better compliance and understanding of GDPR requirements among app developers and third-party vendors.

## 5. Notification Campaign and Analysis

To inform developers and understand the reasons behind these violations, we ran a notification campaign, contacting 11,914 affected developers and gathering insights from 448 responses. Our analysis of violating apps and third parties' documentation revealed that GDPR issues are widespread and often misunderstood. We derived concrete recommendations for all involved entities to help data subjects exercise their fundamental rights and freedoms.

## 6. Recommendations

Based on our findings and analysis, we make the following recommendations:
- **For Developers:** Ensure that explicit consent is obtained before sharing personal data with third parties. Provide clear and understandable consent forms.
- **For Advertisement Providers:** Clearly define and communicate the purpose of data collection and ensure that data is only collected with explicit consent.
- **For App Stores:** Implement stricter guidelines and review processes to ensure that apps comply with GDPR requirements.
- **For Regulators:** Provide more detailed guidance and support to help developers and third parties understand and comply with GDPR.

By addressing these recommendations, all stakeholders can work together to protect users' personal data and ensure compliance with GDPR.
