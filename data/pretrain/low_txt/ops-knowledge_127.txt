### Summary of Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:08:37 to 18:08:43 on October 18, documents several recurring issues and attempts to resolve them in a Hadoop environment. The key points are:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component repeatedly fails to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
   - The failure duration increases by one second with each attempt, starting from 220 seconds at 18:08:37 and reaching 225 seconds at 18:08:42.
   - Each failure is followed by a warning that the system will retry shortly.

2. **Address Changes**:
   - The `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` detects address changes for both the `LeaseRenewer` (port 9000) and the `RMCommunicator Allocator` (port 8030).
   - The old address `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170` is updated to `msra-sa-41` multiple times during this period.

3. **Connection Retries**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempts to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030` but fails.
   - The retry policy is `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between each retry.
   - The connection attempts and failures are logged at 18:08:38, 18:08:40, and 18:08:42, each time noting that no previous attempts have been made (tried 0 times).

4. **Error in Contacting Resource Manager (RM)**:
   - The `RMContainerAllocator` logs an error indicating that it cannot contact the Resource Manager (RM) at 18:08:38, 18:08:40, and 18:08:42.

### Conclusion
The log indicates ongoing issues with lease renewal and server connectivity, with repeated address changes and failed attempts to contact the Resource Manager. The system is configured to retry these operations, but the root cause of the failures and address changes should be investigated to ensure stable operation.
