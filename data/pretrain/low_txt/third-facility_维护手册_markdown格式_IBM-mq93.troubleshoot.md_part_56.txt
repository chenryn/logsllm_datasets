### Queue Manager Name Unavailability and Error Logging

When the queue manager name is unavailable or cannot be determined, channel-related messages are stored in the `/QIBM/UserData/mqm/errors` subdirectory.

#### Examining Error Log Files
To view the contents of any error log file, use your system editor (e.g., `EDTF`) to open the stream files in the Integrated File System (IFS).

**Note:**
1. Do not change the ownership of these error logs.
2. If an error log file is deleted, it will be automatically recreated when the next error message is logged.

### Early Errors
There are special cases where the error logs have not yet been established, and an error occurs. IBM MQ attempts to record such errors in an error log. The location of the log depends on the extent to which the queue manager has been set up.

- **If no location information can be determined (e.g., due to a corrupted configuration file),** errors are logged to an `errors` directory created at installation time.
- **If both the IBM MQ configuration file and the `DefaultPrefix` attribute of the `AllQueueManagers` stanza are readable,** errors are logged in the `errors` subdirectory of the directory identified by the `DefaultPrefix` attribute.

### Operator Messages
Operator messages indicate normal errors, typically caused by users using invalid parameters in commands. These messages are national language enabled and are installed in standard locations. They are written to the job log, if available. Additionally, some operator messages are written to the `AMQERR01.LOG` file in the queue manager directory, while others are written to the `/QIBM/UserData/mqm/errors` directory copy of the error log.

### Example IBM MQ Error Log
Figure 55 (on page 360) shows a typical extract from an IBM MQ error log:

### Related Concepts
- **Error Logs on AIX, Linux, and Windows:** The `errors` subdirectory, created during IBM MQ installation, can contain up to three error log files.
- **Error Logs on z/OS:** On z/OS, error messages are written to the z/OS system console and the channel-initiator job log.
- **First Failure Support Technology (FFST):** FFST provides information about events that can help IBM support personnel diagnose problems.

### Tracing
You can use different types of trace to assist with problem determination and troubleshooting.

### Suppressing Channel Error Messages
You can prevent selected messages from being sent to the error logs for a specified time interval. There are two methods to suppress messages:
1. **Using `SuppressMessage` and `SuppressInterval` in the `QMErrorLog` stanza in the `qm.ini` file.** This method allows you to suppress specific diagnostic messages.
2. **Using environment variables `MQ_CHANNEL_SUPPRESS_MSGS` and `MQ_CHANNEL_SUPPRESS_INTERVAL`.** This method allows you to suppress any channel messages.

#### Procedure
- **Using the `QMErrorLog` stanza in the `qm.ini` file:**
  - Specify the messages to be written to the queue manager error log once only during a given time interval with `SuppressMessage`.
  - Specify the time interval for which the messages are to be suppressed with `SuppressInterval`.

  Example:
  ```ini
  SuppressMessage=9001,9002,9202
  SuppressInterval=30
  ```

- **Using environment variables:**
  1. Specify the messages to be suppressed with `MQ_CHANNEL_SUPPRESS_MSGS`.
     - On AIX and Linux:
       ```sh
       export MQ_CHANNEL_SUPPRESS_MSGS=9999,9002,9209
       ```
     - On Windows:
       ```cmd
       set MQ_CHANNEL_SUPPRESS_MSGS=9999,9002,9209
       ```
  2. Specify the time interval for which the messages are to be suppressed with `MQ_CHANNEL_SUPPRESS_INTERVAL`.
     - Default value: `60,5` (after the first five occurrences of a given message in a 60-second interval, further occurrences are suppressed).
     - Value `0,0` means always suppress.
     - Value `0,n` (where `n > 0`) means never suppress.

### First Failure Support Technology (FFST)
FFST for IBM MQ provides information about events that can help IBM support personnel diagnose problems. FFST files are named `AMQnnnnn.mm.FDC`, where:
- `nnnnn` is the ID of the process reporting the error.
- `mm` is a sequence number, starting at 0.

### Monitoring and Housekeeping
- **Monitor FFST events** and take appropriate remedial action when an event occurs.
- **Ensure good housekeeping** of FFST files by archiving them and clearing the directory to keep only the most recent and relevant FDC files.

### FFST: IBM MQ for AIX or Linux
- **Location:** `/var/mqm/errors`
- **File Naming:** `AMQnnnnn.mm.FDC`
- **Content:** Severe, unrecoverable errors indicating configuration problems or IBM MQ internal errors.

### FFST: IBM MQ for IBM i
- **Location:** `/QIBM/UserData/mqm/errors`
- **File Naming:** `AMQnnnnn.mm.FDC`
- **Content:** Severe, unrecoverable errors indicating configuration problems or IBM MQ internal errors.
