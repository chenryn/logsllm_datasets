# Service Management

## Stopping FTP Service
**Important:** When you stop the FTP service, all connected users will be disconnected without prior warning.

### To Stop the FTP Service:
1. Open **Server Admin** and select **FTP** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Stop Service** (located at the top of the window).

### From the Command Line
You can also stop the FTP service using the `serveradmin` command in Terminal. For more information, refer to the file services chapter in the command-line administration guide.

---

## Allowing Anonymous User Access
You can configure your FTP server to allow guests to log in with the user name "ftp" or "anonymous." No password is required, but they will be prompted to enter an email address.

**Security Note:** It is recommended to disable anonymous access for better security.

### To Enable Anonymous FTP Access:
1. Open **Server Admin** and select **FTP** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings** (near the bottom of the window), then click **General**.
3. Under the **Access** section, select **Enable anonymous access**.
4. Click **Save**.

### From the Command Line
Anonymous FTP access can also be enabled using the `serveradmin` command in Terminal. For more information, see the file services chapter in the command-line administration guide.

## Changing the User Environment
Use the **Advanced** pane in the **Configure FTP Service** settings to modify the user environment.

### To Change the FTP User Environment:
1. Open **Server Admin** and select **FTP** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings** (near the bottom of the window), then click **Advanced**.
3. Choose the desired user environment from the **Authenticated users see** dropdown menu:
   - **FTP Root and Share Points**: Sets up the Users directory as a share point. Authenticated users log in to their home directories if available. Both authenticated and anonymous users can see other users' home directories.
   - **Home Directory with Share Points**: Logs authenticated FTP users into their home directories, providing access to home directories, the FTP root, and FTP share points.
   - **Home Directory Only**: Restricts authenticated FTP access to user home directories only.
4. Click **Save**.

**Note:** Regardless of the user environment, access to all data is controlled by the access privileges assigned to files and folders. Anonymous users and authenticated users without home directories (or whose home directories are not in a share point they can access) are logged in at the root level of the FTP environment.

---

## Changing the FTP Root Directory
The **Advanced** settings allow you to change the path to the FTP root directory.

### To Specify a Different FTP Root:
1. If it does not already exist, create the directory you want to use and configure it as an FTP share point.
2. Open **Server Admin** and select **FTP** from the **Computers & Services** list.
3. Click **Settings** (near the bottom of the window), then click **Advanced**.
4. Enter the path to the new directory in the **Authenticated user FTP root** field, or click the **Browse** button next to the field and select it.

### From the Command Line
You can also change the FTP service root directory using the `serveradmin` command in Terminal. For more information, see the file services chapter in the command-line administration guide.

---

## Viewing the Log
Use **Server Status** to view the FTP log.

### To View the FTP Log:
1. Open **Server Admin** and select **FTP** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Log** (near the bottom of the window).

### To Configure Logging:
To choose the types of events that are recorded, open **Server Admin**, select **AFP**, click **Settings**, then click **Logging**.

### From the Command Line
You can also view the FTP log using the `cat` or `tail` commands in Terminal. For more information, see the file services chapter in the command-line administration guide.

## Displaying Banner and Welcome Messages
FTP service in Mac OS X Server allows you to greet users who contact or log in to your server.

**Note:** Some FTP clients may not display these messages prominently, or at all. For example, in recent releases of the FTP client Fetch, you need to set a preference to display server messages.

- **Banner Message**: Displayed when a user first contacts the server, before logging in.
- **Welcome Message**: Displayed after the user successfully logs in.

### To Display Banner and Welcome Messages:
1. Open **Server Admin** and select **FTP** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings** (near the bottom of the window).
3. Click **Messages**.
4. Select **Show welcome message** and edit the text of the message.
5. Select **Show banner message**, edit the text of the message, and click **Save**.

### From the Command Line
You can also set the FTP service to display these messages using the `serveradmin` command in Terminal. For more information, see the file services chapter in the command-line administration guide.

---

## Displaying Messages Using `message.txt` Files
If an FTP user opens a directory on your server that contains a file named `message.txt`, the contents of this file will be displayed as a message. The user will only see the message the first time they connect to the directory during an FTP session. This can be used to notify users of important information or changes.

---

## Using README Messages
If you place a file called `README` in a directory, an FTP user who opens that directory will receive a message indicating the existence of the file and its last update date. The user can then choose whether to open and read the file.

# Solving Problems

This chapter provides solutions to common problems you might encounter while working with file services in Mac OS X Server.

## General Problems

### Users Can’t Access a CD-ROM Disc
- Ensure the CD-ROM disc is a share point.
- If sharing multiple CDs, ensure each CD has a unique name in the Sharing pane.

### Users Can’t Find a Shared Item
- Check the access privileges for the item. The user must have Read access to the share point and each folder in the path to the item.
- Remember that server administrators see everything on the server, so log in using a user’s credentials to see share points from their perspective.
- An incorrectly configured DNS could cause file service failures, even though DNS is not required for file services.

### Users Can’t See the Contents of a Share Point
- If Write Only access is set for a share point, users won’t be able to see its contents.

### You Can’t Find a Volume or Directory to Use as a Share Point
- Ensure the volume or directory name does not contain a slash (`/`) character, as Workgroup Manager’s Sharing window does not correctly display such names.

## Solving Problems with Apple File Service

### User Can’t Find the Apple File Server
- Verify network settings on the user’s computer and the server.
- Ensure the file server is running (use a pinging utility to check).
- If searching via AppleTalk, enable browsing over AppleTalk in the AFP service settings and ensure AppleTalk is active on both the server and the user’s computer.
- Check the server name and ensure users are looking for the correct name.

### User Can’t Connect to the Apple File Server
- Ensure the user enters the correct username and password (username is not case-sensitive, but the password is).
- Verify that the user is enabled for login in the Users & Groups module of Workgroup Manager.
- Check if the maximum number of client connections has been reached.
- Ensure the server storing users and groups is running.
- Verify the user has AppleShare 3.7 or later installed (administrators need at least 3.8.5 to use the admin password to log in as a user).
- Ensure IP filter service is configured to allow access on port 548 for remote connections.

### User Doesn’t See Login Greeting
- Upgrade the software on the user’s computer to AppleShare client software version 3.7 or later.

## Solving Problems with Windows Services

### User Can’t See the Windows Server in Network Neighborhood
- Ensure users’ computers are properly configured for TCP/IP and have the appropriate Windows networking software installed.
- Enable guest access for Windows users.
- Test connectivity using the `ping` command.
- If users are on a different subnet, ensure a WINS server is available on the network.

### User Can’t Log in to the Windows Server
- If using Password Server, ensure it is configured correctly.
- For user accounts created in previous versions of Mac OS X Server, ensure Authentication Manager is enabled and reset the user’s password.

## Solving Problems with File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

### FTP Connections Are Refused
- Verify the user is entering the correct DNS name or IP address.
- Ensure FTP service is turned on.
- Check the user’s access privileges to the shared volume.
- Check if the maximum number of connections has been reached.
- Verify the user’s computer is correctly configured for TCP/IP.
- Check for DNS issues by trying to connect using the IP address.
- Ensure the user is entering the correct short name and password (special characters and double-byte characters are not supported).
- Check for directory services issues.
- Ensure IP filter service is configured to allow access to the appropriate ports.
- Disable FTP passive mode if it is causing conflicts with port filters.

### Clients Can’t Connect to the FTP Server
- Disable FTP passive mode if it is causing conflicts with port filters.

### Anonymous FTP Users Can’t Connect
- Verify that anonymous access is enabled.
- Check if the maximum number of anonymous user connections has been reached.

## Solving Problems with Home Directories

### Users Can’t Open Their Home Directories
- Ensure the share point for home directories is set up as a network mount in Workgroup Manager.
- Ensure the share point is created in the same Open Directory domain as the user accounts.
- Ensure the client computer is set to use the correct Open Directory domain using Directory Access.

# Glossary

- **AFP (Apple Filing Protocol)**: A client/server protocol used by Apple file service on Macintosh-compatible computers to share files and network services. It uses TCP/IP and other protocols for communication.
- **Drop Box**: A shared folder with write-only privileges for other users. Only the owner has full access.
- **Everyone**: Any user who can log in to a file server, including registered users, guests, anonymous FTP users, or website visitors.
- **Export**: The NFS term for sharing.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: A protocol allowing computers to transfer files over a network. FTP clients can connect to a file server and download files based on their access privileges.
- **Group**: A collection of users with similar needs, simplifying the administration of shared resources.
- **Guest User**: A user who can log in to the server without a username or password.
- **Network File System (NFS)**: A client/server protocol using TCP/IP to allow remote users to access files as if they were local. NFS exports shared volumes based on IP addresses.
- **nfsd Daemon**: An NFS server process that runs continuously to process reading and writing requests from clients.
- **NSL (Network Service Locator)**: Apple technology that simplifies the search for TCP/IP-based network resources.
- **Owner**: The person who created a file or folder, having the ability to assign access privileges. The owner automatically has read/write privileges.
- **Privileges**: Settings defining the type of access users have to shared items. Types include read/write, read-only, write-only, and none.
- **Share Point**: A folder, hard disk, or CD accessible over the network. Share points can be shared using AFP, Windows SMB, NFS, or FTP protocols.
- **SLP (Service Location Protocol) DA (Directory Agent)**: A protocol that registers available network services and provides easy access to them.
- **SMB (Server Message Block)**: A protocol allowing client computers to access files and network services over various network protocols. Used by Windows services for server, printer, and resource access.
- **WINS (Windows Internet Naming Service)**: A name resolution service used by Windows computers to match client names with IP addresses. A WINS server can be located locally or externally on the internet.
