### Balancing Boot Image Access

If you add a second NetBoot server to your network, instruct clients to reselect their boot image via the Startup Disk control panel or preferences pane. This action redistributes the NetBoot load among the servers. Alternatively, you can force the redistribution by deleting the `/var/db/bsdpd_clients` file from the existing NetBoot server.

In scenarios where you are recovering from a server or infrastructure failure, and clients have been booting from a reduced number of NetBoot servers, delete the `bsdpd_clients` file from the running servers. This allows clients to spread out across the entire set of servers again.

The `bsdpd_clients` file on each server contains the Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses of the computers that have selected that server as their NetBoot server. As long as a client's MAC address is in an available server’s `bsdpd_clients` file, it will always boot from that server. If that server becomes unavailable, the clients will locate and associate with another available server until their entries are removed from the original server. If a client is registered on multiple servers because an unavailable server comes back online, the client will boot from the server with the fewest number of clients.

### Distributing Shadow Files

#### Mac OS X Diskless Booting

By default, NetBoot for Mac OS X clients creates a share point for client shadow files on the server boot volume. You can change this behavior using Server Admin. The share points are named `NetBootClientsn`, where `n` is the share point number, starting from zero.

For example, if your server has two disk volumes, the default shadow-file directory is `NetBootClients0` on the boot volume. If you configure Server Admin to store client data on the second volume, the directory is named `NetBootClients1`. NetBoot stores the first client’s shadow files on `NetBootClients0`, the second client’s shadow files on `NetBootClients1`, and so on. With three volumes and eight clients, the first, fourth, and seventh clients will use the first volume; the second, fifth, and eighth clients will use the second volume; and the third and sixth clients will use the third volume. This automatic load balancing ensures optimal performance.

To prevent shadow files from being placed on a particular volume, use the General pane in the NetBoot service settings in Server Admin.

#### Mac OS 9 Booting

By default, NetBoot for Mac OS 9 creates share points for client shadow files on the server boot volume. For example, if your server has two volumes installed, it will have two share points (`NetBootSP0` and `NetBootSP1`). NetBoot stores the first client’s shadow image on `NetBootSP0`, the second client’s shadow image on `NetBootSP1`, the third client’s shadow image on `NetBootSP0`, and so on.

If you partition a 60 GB drive into a 10 GB boot partition and a 50 GB data partition, with the intention of keeping just your operating system and associated configuration files on the boot partition and all user data on the data partition, after installing the NetBoot For 9 software, there will be a `NetBootClients0` on the boot partition and a `NetBootClients1` on the data partition.

To prevent Mac OS 9 shadow files from being placed on a particular volume or partition, delete the hidden file `/Library/NetBoot/.clients` from the volume, then stop and restart the NetBoot service.

### Advanced NetBoot Tuning

You can adjust a wide range of NetBoot options by running the `bootpd` program directly and by modifying configuration parameters in specific NetInfo directories. For more information, read the `bootpd` man page. To view the man page, open Terminal and type `man bootpd`.

### Solving Problems

This chapter provides solutions for common problems you may encounter while working with NetBoot and Network Install.

#### General Tips
- Ensure a DHCP service is available on your network. It can be provided by the Mac OS X Server DHCP service or another server.
- Make sure required services are started on the server. See “Network Service Requirements” on page 15. Open Server Admin and ensure:
  - AFP is started if you’re booting Mac OS 9 clients or Mac OS X diskless clients.
  - Web service is started if you’re using HTTP instead of NFS to deliver images.

#### A NetBoot Client Computer Won’t Start Up
- Sometimes a computer may not start up immediately due to high network demand. Wait a few minutes and try starting up again.
- Ensure all cables are properly connected and that the computer and server are powered.
- If you installed memory or an expansion card in the client computer, ensure it is installed correctly.
- If the server has multiple Ethernet cards or ports, check if other computers using the same card or port can start up. If they can’t, verify that the Ethernet port you set up on the server matches the one to which the client computer is connected.
- If the computer has a local hard disk with a System Folder, disconnect the Ethernet cable and try to start up the computer from the local hard disk. Then reconnect the Ethernet cable and try to start up the computer from the network.
- Boot the client computer from a local drive and check that it is getting an IP address from DHCP.
- On a diskless or systemless client, start up from a system CD and use the Startup Disk preferences to select a boot image.

#### You’re Using Macintosh Manager and a User Can’t Log In to a NetBoot Client
- Check if the user can log in to other computers. If the user can log in to other computers, the issue may be that the computer is connected to a Macintosh Manager server on which the user does not have an account. Ensure the user has selected a server on which they have an account.
- Open Macintosh Manager and ensure the user is a member of at least one workgroup.
- Open Macintosh Manager and reset the user’s password.

#### The Create Button in Network Image Utility Is Not Enabled
- Ensure you have entered an image name and ID in the General pane.
- Ensure you have chosen an image source in the Contents pane.
- For an image based on a CD or DVD source, ensure you have entered a default user name with a password that is at least four characters long in the Default User pane.

#### Controls and Fields in Network Image Utility are Disabled
- Click New Boot or New Install at the top of the window, or close and reopen the Network Image Utility.

#### I Can’t Set an Image to Use Static Booting (NetBoot version 1.0)
- Static network booting, as provided by NetBoot version 1.0, is not supported in Mac OS X Server version 10.3.

### Glossary
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: A protocol used to distribute IP addresses to client computers. Each time a client computer starts up, the protocol looks for a DHCP server and requests an IP address. The DHCP server checks for an available IP address and sends it to the client along with a lease period.
- **Disk Image**: A file that, when opened, creates an icon on a Mac OS desktop that looks and acts like an actual disk or volume. Using NetBoot, client computers can start up over the network from a server-based disk image that contains system software.
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: An application protocol that defines the set of rules for linking and exchanging files on the World Wide Web.
- **NetBoot Server**: A Mac OS X server on which you have installed NetBoot software and configured to allow clients to start up from disk images on the server.
