### Old-Skool Brought Back: A 1964 Modem Demo

**Presenters:**

### Modems Explained
A modem is a device that converts digital signals into analog signals and vice versa, enabling data transmission over telephone lines.

- **Modulator:** Encodes a digital signal into an analog representation.
- **Demodulator:** Reconstructs the digital signal from the analog representation.
- **Digital Signal Rate (bps):** Bits per second.
- **Analog Symbol Rate (baud):** The number of symbols transmitted per second.
- In many cases, bps does not equal baud.

### Timeline of Modem History
- **1959:** Bell 101, 110 baud standard, Anderson-Jacobson modems introduced for private-line use by the US Military.
- **1962:** Bell 103, 300 baud standard, AT&T commercial modems introduced.
- **1963:** Livermore Data Systems Model A.
- **1968:** "The Carterphone Decision" allowing third-party devices to be connected to telephone lines.
- **1972:** Vadic 1200 bps modem.
- **1976:** AT&T Bell 212A 1200 bps standard.
- **1981:** Hayes 300 bps "Smartmodem," introducing the Hayes AT-Command Set.

"That was surprisingly bad-ass. (Especially the part at the beginning where he ripped off the poor grieving little old lady.)"

### Model A: Physical Characteristics
- Hand-crafted wood box with dovetail joints.

Hi,
I stumbled upon your YouTube video, which brought back some interesting memories. We used that model around 1964. The main issue was dirty lines. If the line had any noise, the modem would return junk. We often didn't know about the dirty line until the results were garbled. The worst case was when we got an infinite loop in the mainframe, freezing all terminals. It took some time to diagnose and fix!

### DEMO TIME
or "Shut the hell up and show us the modem!"

#### Demonstrating the Model A Modem
- **Demo 1:** Connecting the modem, modulation, and noise.
- **Demo 2:** Dialing into a system at 300 baud.
- **Demo 3:** Replaying a previously recorded Bell 103 session into the modem.
- **Demo 4:** (Hopefully!) Making the modem talk/listen through unusual mediums:
  - Cellular phone
  - Walkie-talkies
  - PVC pipe
  - Room P.A. system
  - Other?
