### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:09:12 to 18:09:17 on October 18, documents several recurring issues in a Hadoop environment. The key points are as follows:

1. **Connection Attempts and Failures:**
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is repeatedly attempting to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`. Each attempt is logged with an `INFO` level message, indicating that the system is retrying the connection.
   - The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep`, allowing up to 10 retries with a 1-second (1000 milliseconds) sleep interval between each attempt.
   - Each failed connection attempt is followed by an `ERROR` level message, stating "ERROR IN CONTACTING RM" (Resource Manager).

2. **Address Changes:**
   - Multiple `WARN` level messages indicate address changes for both the `RMCommunicator Allocator` and the `LeaseRenewer`.
   - The old address `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` or `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` is being updated to `msra-sa-41:8030` or `msra-sa-41:9000` respectively.

3. **Lease Renewal Failures:**
   - The `LeaseRenewer` is failing to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` for varying durations (255, 256, 257, 258, 259 seconds).
   - Each failure is logged with a `WARN` level message, indicating that the system will retry the lease renewal shortly.

### Detailed Breakdown

  - Lease renewal fails for 255 seconds.

- **18:09:13:**
  - Address change detected for `RMCommunicator Allocator` from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
  - Address change detected for `LeaseRenewer` from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.
  - Lease renewal fails for 256 seconds.

- **18:09:14:**
  - `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempts to connect to `msra-sa-41:8030` (second attempt).
  - Connection fails, and an error is logged.
  - Address change detected for `LeaseRenewer` from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.
  - Lease renewal fails for 257 seconds.

- **18:09:15:**
  - Address change detected for `RMCommunicator Allocator` from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
  - Address change detected for `LeaseRenewer` from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.
  - Lease renewal fails for 258 seconds.

- **18:09:16:**
  - `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempts to connect to `msra-sa-41:8030` (third attempt).
  - Connection fails, and an error is logged.
  - Address change detected for `LeaseRenewer` from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.
  - Lease renewal fails for 259 seconds.

- **18:09:17:**
  - Address change detected for `RMCommunicator Allocator` from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
  - Address change detected for `LeaseRenewer` from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.

### Conclusion

The log indicates a consistent pattern of connection failures and address changes, suggesting potential network or configuration issues. The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is unable to establish a connection to the Resource Manager, and the `LeaseRenewer` is failing to renew leases, which may lead to data integrity and availability issues if not resolved.
