### 7.5 Route Manipulation

To explore route manipulation, we utilized a well-known exchange point's route server that uses BGP communities to control route redistribution. Not only does PEERING connect to this route server, but it also provides a public per-peer view of the accepted prefixes and communities. This route server is a particularly attractive target because it publicly documents its community evaluation order and route server configurations—a policy common among neutral IXPs for transparency [1, 5, 19].

**Experiment:**
From PEERING, we first sent our prefix with a community that instructs the route server to redistribute the route to a particular attackee AS. We then sent the same prefix with a community that suppresses advertisement to the attackee AS. Since these communities conflict, the resulting behavior exposes the route server configuration.

**Validation:**
We used the looking glass of the attackee to determine whether the prefix was redistributed by the route server. Prior to sending the conflicting communities, we observed the announcement at the route server, but during the attack, it was not present.

**Summary:**
While we originated and tagged a prefix using an injection point that is a direct peer of the target route server, this is not a fundamental limitation. However, it does demonstrate that an intermediate provider, upon observing a community for the route server, can add a conflicting community to exploit the evaluation order in a similar fashion. Furthermore, because this route server has hundreds of peers, the potential impact can be significant.

### 7.6 Applicability in the Wild

To gain a more complete understanding of the real-world potential for mounting remote community-based blackholing attacks, we conducted an automated experiment that explored the impact of each of the 307 verified blackhole communities identified in [36]. We used the PEERING testbed to advertise a /24 prefix assigned to us (p), and RIPE Atlas to send active probes to this prefix between August 28 and September 1, 2018.

**Specifically, for each community c in the set of blackhole communities, we:**
1. Advertised p without communities.
2. Issued Atlas ICMP probes from 200 vantage points toward p.
3. Advertised p with community c.
4. Re-issued the same Atlas ICMP probes.

Between each step, we waited five minutes to allow routing to converge and for the Atlas probe requests to finish. The set of 200 Atlas vantage points was randomly chosen but remained constant across all measurements. We then fetched the probing results and compared responses on a per-vantage point basis. We found 25 distinct communities (8.1%) that induced at least one vantage point to be fully responsive prior to advertising the community and then unresponsive once c was attached to the advertisement. These 22 communities affected a total of 48 (24%) of the vantage points.

To confirm that the community was the cause of the dropped Atlas probes, rather than some transient network event, we re-ran the experiment two days later. The results from this second round of probing exactly matched the first, suggesting that the root cause of the observed behavior was indeed due to the blackhole communities being accepted and acted upon by various ASes along the path.

Finally, we issued traceroutes from all of the Atlas vantage points to our prefix p and used a current RouteViews routing table to naively map router interfaces to AS numbers. We then determined a lower-bound on the number of AS hops that the blackhole community traversed by finding the community’s target AS in the path. 13 of 74 community-path pairs received the blackhole community directly, i.e., the PEERING AS directly peered with the community’s target AS. Four of the pairs involved two AS hops, while one involved three AS hops. Fully 75% of the community-path pairs that experienced blocking due to the blackhole community did not have the community’s target AS on the path, either because of non-AS specific communities (e.g., 65535:666) or due to inaccurate IP-to-AS mapping. These results largely confirmed our passive measurements. While the ASes directly connected to PEERING are expected to honor the advertised communities, we found further evidence of communities propagating multiple hops and being acted upon.

In addition to testing previously inferred blackhole communities, we note that the automated framework we describe here can also be used to gain confidence that a particular community is indeed used by a provider as a label for RTBH. This is particularly important when using machine learning or other statistical inference techniques to identify communities. For instance, while [36] found 307 verifiable blackhole communities, an additional 115 were labeled as likely communities. In future work, we plan to test these additional communities.

**Limitations:**
Similarly, we wish in the future to perform automated active experiments using non-RTBH communities to better understand their behavior. Such experiments require more complex inference as the resulting behavior can be subtle and hard to detect (e.g., a path change) compared to RTBH where reachability is a binary test. Moreover, following the PEERING AUP, we are not allowed to conduct an automated experiment for traffic steering and route manipulation attacks as they can trigger path changes that can potentially impact the operation of the involved networks.

### 7.7 Other Observations

In the process of running experiments in the wild, we found that it is possible to inject seemingly contradictory communities. As a case study, we injected fake location communities, i.e., communities used to tag a prefix’s ingress reception point. We then observed the prefix at remote collectors labeled with communities indicating reception on different continents. Speaking with one large operator, we confirmed that this would not disrupt the overall operation, as only a few customers would be affected. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that other operators may rely on community-based location information in unanticipated ways, e.g., for traffic engineering or other operations.

### 8. Discussion

**BGP Communities: Have We Gone Too Far?**
The effectively global propagation of community tags allows for the attacks described above. On the other hand, BGP communities are used by network operators to implement policies and may add useful additional information, e.g., when debugging a network. They provide a low-overhead, simple communication channel between ASes. As such, they are widely in use. However, based on our interaction with the Internet operators' community, the scope of relevance for most communities is one or two hops. The Internet operators' community needs to decide whether the benefits of easy communication outweigh the risks of potential attacks. An extreme way of preventing the kinds of attacks outlined in this paper would be the following: an AS only propagates communities that are useful to the receiving peer. For example, AS1 should send to AS2 only communities of the form 2:xxx. Conversely, if AS2 is a route collector, such as RIPE RIS or Route Views, AS1 might not filter.

**Be Aware of Standardized BGP Communities:**
As we have shown with the remote blackhole attacks, there are drawbacks to standardizing well-known transitive communities with possibly disruptive semantics. On the other hand, those which are purely informative are much less of a concern. Having highly useful active communities not globally published might be called security through obscurity. Although, as we have shown, having a highly active community globally known makes life too easy for the attacker. Therefore, every operator of a network with known BGP communities and active semantics should be aware of the potential ramifications and have appropriate countermeasures in place, e.g., BGP community filters.

**Need for BGP Community Authentication:**
Clearly, there is a strong need for the authentication of the right to attach a community to an announcement or modify one in transit. Unfortunately, there are no known means to do this. Moreover, the adoption of authentication in Internet protocols has been shown to be a slow process, despite the critical role that the Internet plays in today’s economy and society.

**Monitoring the Hygiene of BGP Community Use:**
Abuse of communities might be discouraged by monitoring from the points of view of global BGP collectors such as RIPE RIS and Route Views, analogous to what is being done for BGP hijacks today. This strategy comes with all the problems of BGP monitoring: there is no global BGP view, and route collectors only see the announcements they receive. The latter makes inferences on what happens on the path between the origin and the collector very difficult. In addition, the lack of structural semantics of BGP communities leaves a lot of room for misinterpretations. Of course, well-known communities can and should be monitored. Yet, this only covers a small fraction of the available community space. Monitoring BGP community behavior is not an active defense, but attribution of abuse might strongly discourage abuse.

**Need for Proper Documentation:**
Similar to ongoing efforts for bogon and other filtering, the operational community should publish and update well-tested best current practices and configuration patterns for community generation, propagation, action semantics, etc.

### 9. Conclusion

In this paper, we measured the increasing use and propagation of BGP communities and demonstrated the resulting increase in exposure to abuse by remote parties; e.g., to blackhole prefixes, steer traffic, and manipulate routes. A key insight is that a significant fraction of transit providers, more than 14%, forward received communities onward. Given the rich interconnectivity of the Internet, this means that communities effectively propagate globally. Attacks are possible due in part to ill-defined BGP community semantics, error-prone configurations, as well as the lack of cryptographic integrity and authentication for BGP communities.

By analyzing BGP announcements at many collectors worldwide, we observed that the propagation of communities is a global Internet phenomenon that enables routing vulnerabilities at scale. We tested the feasibility of BGP community-based attacks in lab experiments and commented on the possibilities of launching such attacks in the wild. Unfortunately, such BGP attacks are successful even without prefix hijacking and even if BGP authentication is used. We highlighted the need to increase awareness among current and future users of BGP communities regarding their possible abuse cases. We concluded that BGP communities are yet another highly used BGP feature that can yield many unintended consequences.

As part of our future agenda, we want to investigate ways to infer instances of any of the three types of BGP community-based attacks using passive measurements. This requires the development of a new methodology that assigns the role of the tagger of the BGP community to a network with the intent to perform one of the attacks described in the paper. Notice that both the relative position of the network in the path and the BGP community that it tags have to be considered for this inference. Identifying an attacker in BGP is not trivial due to the lack of authentication and integrity. We also want to investigate other types of BGP community-based attacks and assess their feasibility.
