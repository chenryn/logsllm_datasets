## SCADA Industry
**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

### Marketplace Overview
- Primarily focused on ICS (Industrial Control Systems) equipment sales over software sales.
- Active in merger and acquisition activities.
- Highly regionalized.

**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

## What is the Human-Machine Interface (HMI)?
- Serves as the main hub for managing and operating control systems.
- Collects data from the control systems.
- Provides a visualization of the system architecture.
- Alerts operators and sends notifications.
- Should be operated on isolated and trusted networks.

**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

## Why Target the Human-Machine Interface?
- To control the targeted critical infrastructure.
- To harvest information about the system architecture.
- To disable alarming and notification systems.
- To physically damage SCADA equipment.

## ICS-CERT
- Organization within the Department of Homeland Security.
- Focus areas:
  - Responding to and analyzing control systems-related incidents.
  - Conducting vulnerability and malware analysis.
  - Providing onsite incident response services.
  - Coordinating the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities and associated mitigations.
- In 2015, ICS-CERT responded to 295 incidents and handled 486 vulnerability disclosures.

## Critical Infrastructure Attacks
**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

### Targeting Water Utilities
- Compromised internet-facing AS/400 system responsible for:
  - Network routing.
  - Manipulation of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).
  - Management of customer PII and billing information.
- Altered settings related to water flow and the amount of chemicals in the water supply.
- Four separate connections to the AS/400 over a 60-day period.
- Actors linked to previous hacktivist activities.

### Targeting Power Plants
- On December 24, 2015, Ukrainian companies experienced unscheduled power outages affecting over 225,000 customers.
  - Caused by external malicious actors.
  - Multiple coordinated attacks within 30 minutes of each other.
- Used remote administration tools and/or remote industrial control system (ICS) client software to control breakers.
- Utilized KillDisk to overwrite Windows-based human-machine interface systems, disrupting restoration efforts.

### Targeting Railway and Mining Industries
- Malware similar to the power incident was found in attacks against a Ukrainian rail and mining company (November–December 2015).
- Overlap between the samples found in the Ukrainian power incident and those used against the Ukrainian mining company.
  - Malware leveraged: BlackEnergy/KillDisk.
  - Shared infrastructure and naming conventions.

## Prevalent Vulnerability Types
**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

## Current State of HMI Solutions
- Not built with security in mind.
- Have not benefited from the evolution of secure SDL (Security Development Lifecycle).
- Mitigations against advanced attacks are often disabled.
- Poor design and developer assumptions.
- Lack of understanding of the real operating environment.
  - Not on isolated or trusted networks.
  - Continuously being interconnected.

- Credential Management
- Insecure Defaults
- Authentication/Authorization
- Injection
- Other

### Memory Corruption
- 20% of identified vulnerabilities.
- Common vulnerability types:
  - Stack-based Buffer Overflow
  - Heap-based Buffer Overflow
  - Out-of-bounds Read/Write
- Zero Day Initiative case study:
  - **Advantech WebAccess webvrpcs Service BwOpcSvc.dll WindowName sprinq Stack-Based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**

### Advantech WebAccess Case Study
- ICS-CERT states: "There are many instances where the buffer on the stack can be overwritten."
- Identifiers:
  - CVE-2016-0856
  - ZDI-16-048
  - ICSA-16-014-01
- CVSS Score: 9.3
- Disclosure Timeline:

### Advantech WebAccess HMI Solution
- Launches a service, `webvrpcs.exe`, in the context of a local administrative user.
- The service listens on TCP port 4592 by default and may be accessed over an RPC-based protocol.
- The application interface is structured to resemble the Windows Device IoControl function, with each function containing a field similar to an IOCTL.

**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

### Prototype of RPC Function
**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

### IOCTL 0x0001388B
- Inside `BwOpcSvc.dll` (loaded into `webvrpc.exe`), the routine with an exported entry name of `BwSvcFunction` processes a number of entry points using a jump table.
- Flaw exists within the implementation of IOCTL 0x0001388B.
- A stack-based buffer overflow exists in a call to `sprinq` using the `WindowName` parameter.

### Patch Analysis
- `_sprinq` is on the Microsoft banned APIs list, first published in 2007.
  - [Microsoft Banned APIs List](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb288454.aspx)
- Advantech should implement the Microsoft banned APIs and remove all of them from shipping code.
- What they did…

### Patch Analysis
- The `WindowName` field in the stack buffer is 0x80 bytes.
- The `_snprinq` Length parameter is 0x7f bytes.
