### Coverage Estimation Methods

- **(a) Helium-Reported Coverage:** This is the coverage as reported by the Helium network.
- **(b) 300m Cutoff Estimate:** This method estimates coverage using a 300-meter cutoff distance.
- **(c) Witness Convex Hulls:** This method uses the convex hulls formed by witness hotspots to estimate coverage.
- **(d) Adjusted Witness Convex Hulls:** This method removes witnesses that are more than 25 kilometers away from the challengee, refining the convex hull coverage.
- **(e) Revised Convex Hull Model with RSSI:** This model factors in the hotspots that make up the vertices of the convex hull and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).

### Figures and Data

- **Figure 12: Estimates of Coverage.** 
  - **Figure 12e** shows the final result of the revised model. The green regions represent the revised convex hull model, while the yellow areas represent added radial coverage. The almost-invisible red trim around the yellow regions indicates the RSSI coverage. At a median RSSI of -108 dBm, the RSSI step adds only an additional 20 meters of coverage range. With this model, the network achieves 3.3032% coverage of the contiguous United States.

  - This figure shows the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of all valid witness distances, with an inset CDF for the distance interval from 0 km to 40 km.

- **Figure 14: CDF of RSSI Values.** 
  - This figure displays the CDF of RSSI values recorded by witnesses during Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) requests from May 18, 2021, to May 22, 2021.

### Measured Coverage

We conducted two real-world experiments to observe the empirical coverage of hotspots, with results shown in **Figures 15a and 15b**. We planned neighborhood walks through areas with varying hotspot density, carrying an edge device running the counter app. GPS coordinates and timestamps were added to the app payload, and packets were logged to an SD card. These walks achieved Packet Reception Rates (PRR) of 72.9% and 77.6%, respectively.

- **HIP 15 Promise Analysis:**
  - Predicting reception within 300 meters of a hotspot was accurate 55.5% of the time, while predicting no reception outside this radius was accurate 79.6% of the time.

- **LoRa Protocol Acknowledgment Mechanism:**
  - The LoRa protocol includes an acknowledgment (ACK) mechanism, where an edge device can request an ACK response from its owning router. Failure to receive an ACK is recorded as a NACK. The LoRa PHY is asymmetric, making uplink (edge→gateway) easier than downlink (gateway→edge). This asymmetry means the cloud may record data that the edge device thinks it needs to retransmit.

- **Tables 2 and 3: LoRa ACK/NACK Validity:**
  - These tables show the validity of ACK and NACK messages. No false ACK messages were found, but many false NACK messages occurred—packets received on the cloud but recorded as NACKs by the edge device.

### Discussion

#### Legal Considerations

Several challenges faced by Helium, such as the high proportion of relayed nodes and unreliable hotspot network connections, likely stem from hotspots using residential ISPs for backhaul. Many ISPs are also rolling out competing IoT networks, and some, like Spectrum, may not allow users to host hotspots according to their terms of service. If Spectrum enforces these provisions, at least 17% of US hotspots could fall offline.

#### Looking Beyond LoRa

Helium targets low-power IoT devices, which are well-suited to its micro-transaction model. The use of residential Internet infrastructure for coverage is not new, but Helium's entry into more traditional communication markets, such as 5G, presents a potential business threat. It will be interesting to see how Helium's meta-infrastructure suppliers and consumers respond to this opportunity.

### Conclusion

The Helium network continues to expand rapidly, providing broad connectivity for commodity edge devices. While the uncontrolled deployment of hotspots allows for efficient growth, it does not ensure reliable or predictable coverage. Helium must enforce policies to improve network robustness. Additionally, the network's reliance on a small number of residential ISPs for backhaul traffic poses a significant risk if those ISPs disallow Helium hotspots.

### Ethical Considerations

This work does not directly interact with human subjects and uses network services as intended. All services are paid for using credits earned from operating infrastructure for the network. We minimize explicit identification of individual users and use pseudonyms where necessary.

### Disclosure of Possible Conflicts of Interest

All authors are either students or faculty at an academic institution and have no direct affiliation with the Helium corporation. The research group has purchased, deployed, and operates two Helium hotspots, acquiring several thousand HNT through normal operations. One author owns a modest amount of HNT as a personal investment. This work is not intended to influence the value of HNT.
