## Abstract
Advancements in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have introduced new computing paradigms such as cloud computing, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence, and aware-computing. These paradigms have revolutionized the techniques for processing, storing, communicating, sharing, and disseminating information. While these innovations offer significant benefits, including universal data access, reduced costs, and elastic storage and computation services, they also pose substantial risks of privacy breaches. The 15th Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society (WPES 2016) aims to address these challenges by providing a forum for discussing open privacy issues, emerging trends, and innovative approaches to ensuring privacy in today's interconnected society.

**Keywords:** Privacy, electronic society, workshop

## 1. Introduction
The collection and use of personal data are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. Every action and transaction we perform generates data that is collected, stored, exchanged, and shared with multiple third parties in the digital infrastructure. The amount of data related to our communications, interests, and personal lives (e.g., photos and videos) available through the network is growing exponentially. Although this scenario offers significant benefits, it also leaves private data exposed, leading to a loss of control over what information others know or collect about us, how it is used, and to whom it is disclosed. The advances in ICT, including the ability to combine and analyze data from various sources, exacerbate these privacy concerns. Consequently, security and privacy issues are receiving increasing attention from researchers, industry, legislators, governments, and individual users.

WPES aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss privacy issues in the electronic society. The workshop encourages participation from experts in both the technological aspects of privacy and related fields such as law and business, fostering a multidisciplinary dialogue. WPES provides a platform for researchers to share their ideas and results, discuss new technological trends and the associated security and privacy challenges, and explore new research directions. As in previous years, WPES is held in conjunction with the ACM Computer and Communications Security (CCS) conference, the flagship annual event of ACM SIGSAC (Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control). This co-location benefits both events and the broader community, as WPES complements ACM CCS by focusing specifically on privacy, a critical aspect of security.
