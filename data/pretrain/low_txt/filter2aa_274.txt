Additionally, your use of the term "ZILLA" along with imagery associated with "GODZILLA" suggests an attempt to benefit from the goodwill and reputation built by Toho over many years.

3. **Unauthorized Software Distribution**: Your site promotes the distribution of software such as "Disco AIBO," "AIBO Scope," and "Bender AIBO," which appear to be derived from Sony's copyrighted software.

**American Kennel Club (AKC) Trademark Infringement Notice**

The use of the name "Aibo Kennel Club" on your website is clearly designed to trade on the goodwill associated with the AKC's well-known name. Furthermore, your site claims that registering with the "Aibo Kennel Club" ensures a known "lineage" for Aibo robots. However, since Aibo robots do not produce offspring, there is no "lineage" to record.

We request that you immediately discontinue the use of the name "Aibo Kennel Club" and remove any misleading statements from your website.
