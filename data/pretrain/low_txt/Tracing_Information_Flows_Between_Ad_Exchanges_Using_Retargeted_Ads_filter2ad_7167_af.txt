### Criteo and SSPs: An Analysis of Retargeting and User Tracking

Given that Criteo was identified as the largest retargeter in the US and UK in 2014 [15], it is not surprising that it plays a significant role in the ad ecosystem. In contrast, Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs) tend to have in/out degree ratios closer to 1, as they facilitate the exchange of ads between multiple publishers, Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs), and even other SSPs.

Some SSPs, such as Atwola, work more closely with publishers and thus appear more frequently at position p2 in the ad chain. Others, like Mathtag, cater primarily to other SSPs and therefore appear almost exclusively at position pn−1. Most of the observed SSPs also function as DSPs, serving some retargeted ads. However, there are "pure" SSPs, such as Casale Media and OpenX, that do not serve ads themselves.

Table 3 reveals that SSPs generally engage in more user tracking than DSPs by embedding themselves in more e-commerce sites, with Criteo being a notable exception.

### Google's Role in the Ad Ecosystem

Google is an interesting case study due to the clearly delineated purposes of its different domains. For instance, `googletagservices` is Google’s in-house SSP, which funnels impressions directly from publishers to Google’s DSPs: `2mdn`, `googlesyndication`, and `doubleclick`. In contrast, `googleadservices` is also an SSP but holds auctions with third-party participants, such as Criteo. Both `googlesyndication` and `doubleclick` function as both SSPs and DSPs, sometimes holding auctions and sometimes winning auctions held by others to serve ads. Google Syndication is the second most frequent source of retargeted ads in our dataset, behind Criteo.

### Concluding Discussion

In this study, we develop a novel, principled methodology for detecting flows of tracking information between ad exchanges. The key insight is that we repurpose retargeted ads as a detection mechanism, as their presence reveals information flows between ad exchanges. Our methodology is content-agnostic, allowing us to identify flows even if they occur on the server-side. This is a significant improvement over prior work, which relies on heuristics to detect cookie matching [2, 54, 21]. As shown in § 6, these heuristics fail to detect 31% of matching pairs today and are likely to fail more in the future as ad networks adopt content obfuscation techniques.

### Implications for Users

Our ultimate goal is not just to measure information flows between ad exchanges but to facilitate the development of systems that balance user privacy against the revenue needs of publishers. Currently, users face unsatisfactory choices when deciding whether and how to block ads and tracking. Whitelisting approaches like NoScript are effective at protecting privacy but are too complicated for most users and deprive publishers of revenue. Blocking third-party cookies is ineffective against first-party trackers (e.g., Facebook). AdBlockPlus' controversial "Acceptable Ads" program is poorly governed and leaves users vulnerable to unscrupulous ad networks [62]. Do Not Track (DNT) is largely ineffective [8].

We believe that data about information flows between ad exchanges can open up a new middle ground in ad blocking. One possibility is to develop an automated system that continuously crawls ads, identifies cookie matching flows, and constructs rules that match these flows. Users could then install a browser extension that blocks flows matching these rules. This extension would offer improved privacy protection relative to existing systems (e.g., Ghostery and Disconnect) while still allowing advertising. However, the challenge would be making it cost-effective, as it would rely on crowdsourced labor.

Another possibility is using our data as ground-truth for a sophisticated blocker that relies on client-side Information Flow Control (IFC). There are many promising, lightweight approaches to implementing JavaScript IFC in the browser [30, 10, 59, 31]. However, IFC alone is not enough to block cookie matching flows, as ad networks obfuscate data, making it impossible to separate benign from "leaky" flows in general. Instead, we can use information gathered using our methodology as ground-truth to mark data in specific incoming flows and rely on IFC to enforce restrictions that prevent outgoing flows from containing the marked data.
