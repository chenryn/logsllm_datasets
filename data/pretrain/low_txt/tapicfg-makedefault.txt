### tapicfg makedefault

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `tapicfg makedefault` command sets the default TAPI (Telephony Application Programming Interface) application directory partition for a specified domain.

**Syntax:**
```shell
tapicfg makedefault /directory:<fully_qualified_domain_name> [/domain:<domain_name>]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/directory:**  
  - **Required.** Specifies the fully-qualified DNS name of the TAPI application directory partition that will be set as the default partition for the domain.
  - **Example:** `/directory:example.com`

- **/domain:**  
  - **Optional.** Specifies the DNS name of the domain for which the TAPI application directory partition is set as the default. If not specified, the local domain name is used.
  - **Example:** `/domain:contoso.com`

- **/?**  
  - Displays help information at the command prompt.
  - **Example:** `tapicfg makedefault /?`

**Remarks:**

- This command-line tool can be executed on any computer that is a member of the domain.
- User-supplied text, such as the names of TAPI application directory partitions, servers, and domains, with international or Unicode characters, will only display correctly if the appropriate fonts and language support are installed.
- You can still use Internet Locator Service (ILS) servers in your organization if ILS is needed to support certain applications. TAPI clients running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 can query either ILS servers or TAPI application directory partitions.
- The `tapicfg` tool can also be used to create or remove service connection points. If the TAPI application directory partition is renamed (e.g., due to a domain rename), you must remove the existing service connection point and create a new one with the updated DNS name. Otherwise, TAPI clients will be unable to locate and access the TAPI application directory partition.
- Service connection points can also be removed for maintenance or security purposes, such as when you do not want to expose TAPI data on a specific TAPI application directory partition.
