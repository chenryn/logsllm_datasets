### Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ

#### 1. No Operations of a Specific Type Can Occur
- **Indication:** This indicates that no operations of that type can occur. The values might have changed, or the queue might have been open but is now closed.
- **Action:** Check the status at the time you expect to put or get a message.
- **Further Assistance:** If you are unable to solve the problem, contact IBM Support for help.

#### 2. Problem Affecting Only Remote Queues
- **Condition:** If the problem affects only remote queues, perform the following checks:
  - **Channel Status:** Ensure that required channels have started, can be triggered, and any required initiators are running.
  - **Message Transmission:** Verify that the programs putting messages to the remote queues have not reported problems.
  - **Triggering:** If you use triggering to start the distributed queuing process, check that the transmission queue has triggering set on and that the trigger monitor is running.
  - **Error Logs:** Review the error logs for messages indicating channel errors or problems.
  - **Manual Start:** If necessary, start the channel manually.

#### 3. Slow Application or System Performance
- **Condition:** If your application is running slowly, it might be in a loop, waiting for a resource that is not available, or there might be a performance problem.
- **Possible Causes:**
  - **System Load:** Your system might be operating near the limits of its capacity, which is often worst during peak load times (mid-morning and mid-afternoon).
  - **Hardware Limitations:** A performance problem might be caused by a limitation of your hardware.
  - **Application Design:** If performance degradation is not dependent on system loading, a poorly-designed application program is likely to blame. This could appear to be a problem that only occurs when certain queues are accessed.
  - **Persistent Messages:** A common cause of slow application performance or message buildup on a queue (usually a transmission queue) is one or more applications writing persistent messages outside a unit of work.
- **Action:** For more information, see "Message persistence." If the performance issue persists, contact IBM Support for help.

#### 4. Resource Problems on AIX
- **Related Concepts:**
  - **Additional Checks for Resource Problems on AIX:** Determine and resolve problems connected to IBM MQ resources, including resource usage by IBM MQ processes, insufficient resources, and resource limit configurations.
  - **Useful Commands and Configuration Files:**
    - `ulimit -a`: Display user limits
    - `ulimit -Ha`: Display user hard limits
    - `ulimit -Sa`: Display user soft limits
    - `ulimit -paramflag`: Where `paramflag` is the flag for the resource name (e.g., `s` for stack).
    - To make permanent changes, use `/etc/security/limits.conf` or `/etc/security/limits`.

- **Basic Checks Before Tuning:**
  - **Active Connections:** Ensure the number of active connections is within the expected limit.
  - **IBM MQ Processes:**
    - `ps -elf|egrep "amq|run"|wc -l`
  - **Number of Connections:**
    - `echo "dis conn(*) all" | runmqsc |grep EXTCONN|wc -l`
  - **Shared Memory Usage:**
    - `ipcs -ma`

- **Resources to Check and Tune:**
  - Data segment
  - Stack segment
  - File size
  - Open file handles
  - Shared memory limits
  - Thread limits
  - Use the `mqconfig` command to check current resource usage.

#### 5. Creating Threads or Processes
- **Failure Conditions:**
  - **xcsExecProgram and xcsCreateThread:**
    - **Probe IDs and Error Messages:**
      - `XY348010` from `xtmStartTimerThread` from an IBM MQ process (e.g., `amqzlaa0`) or an application.
      - `XC037008` from `xcsExecProgram` with error code `xecP_E_PROC_LIMIT` from `amqzxma0`.
      - `XC035040` from `xcsCreateThread`.
      - `XC037007` from `xcsExecProgram` with `xecP_E_NO_RESOURCE`.
      - `AMQ6119S`: An internal IBM MQ error has occurred ('11 - Resource temporarily unavailable' from `pthread_create`).

- **Resolving the Problem on AIX:**
  - **EAGAIN:**
    - Increase the max user processes and stack size user process resource limits.
  - **ENOMEM:**
    - Increase the stack size and data resource limits.
  - **Notes:**
    - Use the `ulimit` command or modify `/etc/security/limits` or `/etc/security/limits.conf` to make changes permanent.
    - Review OS manuals (e.g., `man` page for `pthread_create`) for more details on resource issues and tuning.

#### 6. Shared Memory Issues
- **Errors:**
  - **shmget Fails with ENOSPC (No Space Left on Device):**
    - **Probe ID:** `XY132002`
    - **Component:** `xstCreateExtent`
    - **Description:** `AMQ6119: An internal IBM MQ error has occurred` (Failed to get memory segment: `shmget(0x00000000, 2547712) [rc=-1 errno=28] No space left on device`).
  - **shmget Fails with EINVAL (Invalid Argument):**
    - **Operating System:** SunOS 5.10
    - **Probe ID:** `XY132002`
    - **Component:** `xstCreateExtent`
    - **Description:** `AMQ6024: Insufficient resources are available to complete a system request` (Failed to get memory segment: `shmget(0x00000000, 9904128) [rc=-1 errno=22] Invalid argument`).

- **Resolution:**
  - Configure the kernel (e.g., `shmmax`) to allow a shared memory segment of at least 9904128 bytes.

#### 7. Unexpected Process Termination and Queue Manager Crash
- **Example FDC:**
  - **Date/Time:** Mon May 02 2016 01:00:58 CEST
  - **Host Name:** test.ibm.com
  - **LVLS:** 8.0.0.4
  - **Product Long Name:** IBM MQ for Linux (x86-64 platform)
  - **Probe Id:** XC723010
  - **Component:** xprChildTermHandler
  - **Major Errorcode:** xecP_E_USER_TERM
  - **Minor Errorcode:** OK
  - **Description:** AMQ6125: An internal IBM MQ error has occurred.

- **Possible Causes and Solutions:**
  - **User-Ended Process:** Check if the user has ended any process.
  - **Memory Exception:** Check if the IBM MQ process ended because of a memory exception (FDC Component: `xehExceptionHandler`).
  - **High Memory Usage:** Review the operating system log for high memory usage (e.g., OOM-killer on Linux).

#### 8. User Limits and Process Configuration
- **Difference in User Limits:**
  - The user limits used by the process might differ from the configured limits, especially if the process is started by a different user, script, or high availability script.
  - **Action:** Check the user starting the queue manager and set the appropriate resource limits for this user.

#### 9. Making Initial Checks on IBM i
- **Preliminary Questions:**
  - **Has IBM MQ for IBM i Run Successfully Before?**
    - **Yes:** Proceed to the next step.
    - **No:** Reinstall or set up IBM MQ correctly. See IBM MQ installation overview and related documentation.
  - **Has the IBM MQ Application Run Successfully Before?**
    - **Yes:** Proceed to the next step.
    - **No:** Check compiler or linker output, programming logic, and common errors (e.g., incorrect security authorization, incorrect parameters in MQI calls, etc.).
  - **Has the IBM MQ Application Changed Since the Last Successful Run?**
    - **Yes:** Check all changes and identify the new or modified part causing the problem.
    - **No:** Review the current queue status and files being processed when the error occurred.

By following these steps, you can systematically identify and resolve issues with IBM MQ. For further assistance, contact IBM Support through the IBM Support Site.
