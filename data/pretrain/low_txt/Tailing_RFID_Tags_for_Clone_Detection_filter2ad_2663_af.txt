# Detection and False-Alarm Rates for Different Anti-Cloning Schemes

## Introduction
This document compares the performance of three anti-cloning schemes: robust 1-bit tailing (R-TAIL), robust synchronization (R-SYNCH), and process-based (PROC) in terms of detection rate (True Positive Rate, TPR) and false-alarm rate (False Positive Rate, FPR). The analysis is conducted under various scenarios, including different levels of adversarial control and compromised readers.

## Figure 11. Detection and False-Alarm Rates
### (a) Highest Detection Rate (DT = 1)
- **R-TAIL**: Achieves a TPR of 27% with a very low FPR of 0.95%.
- **PROC**: Achieves a TPR of 42% but with a higher FPR of 17%.
- **R-SYNCH**: Achieves a TPR of 35% with an FPR of 31%.

### (b) Lowest False-Alarm Rate (FPR = 0%)
- **R-TAIL**: Maintains a high TPR of 38%.
- **PROC**: Has a lower TPR of 22%.
- **R-SYNCH**: Has a TPR of 37%.

## Process-Based (PROC) Scheme
The PROC scheme verifies the consistency of product movements between locations without modifying tag memory or extending attributes. It checks:
1. A product shipped from location A (event \( e_i \) with \( S = \text{shipping} \) and \( L = A \)) is received at location B (event \( e_{i+1} \) with \( S = \text{receiving} \) and \( L = B \)).
2. A product received at location A (event \( e_i \) with \( S = \text{receiving} \) and \( L = A \)) is then shipped from the same location (event \( e_{i+1} \) with \( S = \text{shipping} \) and \( L = A \)).

If these conditions are not met, an alarm is raised. Tag events are stored in local databases and later evaluated for rule compliance and clone detection.

## Security and Robustness
### Baseline Scenario
- **R-TAIL** and **SYNCH** achieve comparable TPRs (93%) but R-TAIL has a significantly lower FPR (0.95% vs. 35% for SYNCH and 32% for PROC).
- **R-SYNCH** introduces a miswrite flag to mitigate false alarms, achieving a lower FPR (16% vs. 35% for SYNCH).

### Robust Process-Based (R-PROC)
- **R-PROC** relaxes the two-rule system to allow for missing events, reducing both FPR and TPR.
- For FPR = 0%, R-PROC achieves TPR = 22% compared to TPR = 34% for PROC.

### Adversarial Control
- **R-TAIL** has the lowest TPR (e.g., 27% for \( |L_A| = 7 \) and \( |V_A| = 10 \)) but with substantially lower FPR (0.95% vs. 17% for PROC and 31% for R-SYNCH).
- Normalized FPR shows R-TAIL achieving the highest TPRs.

## Cost Comparison
- **Storage, Computation, and Communication Costs**: Linear in the number of trace events \( n \).
- **Event Size Overhead**: 
  - **SYNCH**: 32 bits (14% increase).
  - **R-TAIL**: 24 bits (10% increase).
  - **PROC**: No tag writes, no overhead.
- **Tag Processing Speeds**:
  - **PROC**: 24.4–1838 tags/s.
  - **SYNCH**: 4.5 tags/s.
  - **R-TAIL**: 44.5 tags/s.

## Summary
- **R-TAIL** outperforms other approaches with a high detection rate and low false-alarm rate.
- **Table 3** provides a detailed comparison, highlighting the distinct vulnerabilities and performance of each scheme.

## Related Work
- **Anti-Counterfeiting Solutions**: Various approaches have been proposed, including statistical anomaly detection, pattern matching, and cryptographic methods.
- **Tailing**: Simple and practical, effective even in blind zones, and requires minimal resources.

## Conclusion
- **Tailing** is a potent tool for detecting RFID tag cloning, especially in supply chains with incomplete and inconsistent data.
- Potential applications include post-supply-chain goods and RFID-enabled payment devices.
