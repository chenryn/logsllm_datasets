## Abstract
Underground forums, where participants exchange information on abusive tactics and engage in the sale of illegal goods and services, are a form of online social network (OSN). Unlike traditional OSNs such as Facebook, underground forums capture dynamic trust relationships forged between mutually distrustful parties. In this paper, we empirically characterize six different underground forums — BlackHatWorld, Carders, HackSector, HackElite, Freehack, and L33tCrew — examining the properties of the social networks formed within, the content of the goods and services being exchanged, and how individuals gain and lose trust in this setting.

## 1. Introduction
Online social networks (OSNs) provide a concrete representation of the character and dynamics of human social relationships. Consequently, the popularity of such services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) has been closely followed by researchers, who use the explicit nature of these networks to characterize social graph properties and user interactions [6, 11]. While less explored, there are also implicit social networks defined via interaction on other shared platforms (e.g., Web forums, blogs). This paper focuses on a particular sub-population: underground forums.

Users of underground forums engage in activities similar to those found on traditional OSNs: they maintain profiles, add fellow users to buddy lists, and communicate via private messaging. However, the primary purpose of these forums is not just social contact but to support criminal or "grey hat" activities. Users regularly buy, sell, and trade abusive services and illegally obtained goods such as credit card numbers, online currencies, compromised accounts, and even drugs. Since users often know each other only through pseudonyms, they must develop new means to establish trust among themselves.

In this paper, we examine these implicit social networks and their use in the context of six underground forums — BlackHatWorld, Carders, FreeHack, HackElite, HackSector, and L33tCrew — for which we have complete activity records. Our analysis is organized into three parts: first, we analyze the structure of the underlying social networks present on the forums; second, we examine the commercial aspects of the sites (e.g., types of products sold, active market players); and finally, we look at how different reputational factors impact behavior. We believe our work provides valuable insight into how online criminal actors create and develop social relationships to support their goals.

## 2. Background
Online underground markets have existed in various forms for decades. Early markets used Internet Relay Chat (IRC) to share information about the availability and pricing of goods and services (e.g., stolen credit cards, accounts, botnets, cash-out services) [10, 4]. Over time, many of these markets moved to persistent Web forums and expanded to cover a broader range of information sharing. The use of such forums in China was first documented by Zhuge et al. [12], and contemporary analyses have been published by Holt et al. [5], Radianti [7], and Fallmann et al. [3].

Some forums have specialized and adopted closed models, where new members must be vouched for by existing members. For example, Stone-Gross et al. [9] documented the membership and goods on offer on the private Spamdot.biz forum, which specialized in support for email spammers. The goal of such forums is to expand the knowledge base of participants and the set of potential trading partners. However, there is little public research that empirically examines the social networks formed in these forums or the mechanisms employed to manage trust. Such analyses can be challenging since modern forums combine public sections, restricted sections (requiring higher status), and person-to-person private messages (PMs) that may not be externally visible.

## 3. Data Overview
In this study, we have access to complete records of six underground forums via SQL dumps of their underlying databases. While we do not claim that these six forums are representative of all underground forums, they provide a starting point for understanding the dynamics of such forums. Each dataset was acquired by unknown outside parties and made public ("leaked") via various methods. Each forum contains a wealth of information, including user registration data, private messages, forum posts, member status changes, and banned user logs. For a more comprehensive list of the available data, please refer to the Invision Power Board (for L33tCrew) and vBulletin database schemas [1, 2].

### Forum Descriptions
- **BlackhatWorld (BH)**: Founded around 2005, primarily English-speaking, focused on blackhat search engine optimization (SEO). Initially oriented towards discussing blackhat techniques, it now includes over 800 threads in the services-for-sale section and more than 275 threads in the goods-for-sale section.
- **Carders (CC)**: German-speaking, focused on monetizing stolen credit card numbers and bank account information. Heavily geared towards the exchange of goods and services.
- **L33tCrew (LC)**: Similar to CC in content and types of products exchanged.
- **Freehack (FH)**: Another German site, covering a range of topics from crypting (encoding software to make detecting malware more difficult) to video games. Items for sale include Steam (gaming) accounts, automatic account creators, and hacking software.
- **HackSector (HS) and HackElite (HL)**: Similar to each other, with HL being English-speaking.

### Summary of Data
Table 1 summarizes the membership and activity across each of these forums. In total, our analysis covers over 2.5 million posts, 900k private messages, and 100k users. The datasets span various time periods, with FH and HS covering approximately six years, while HL is the shortest at roughly one year. LC is our largest dataset by forum activity, with the most threads (120k), posts (860k), and private messages (500k). The forums geared towards commerce, CC and LC, have a much higher number of private messages, reflecting the frequent business transactions conducted over PMs. Across all forums, a significant number of "lurkers" (individuals who register an account but take no action) exist, with over 55% of users on FH, HS, and HL being lurkers. The trading forums have a smaller fraction of lurkers, with only 35% in CC and 46% in LC.

## 4. Underground Social Networks
In this section, we analyze the structural properties of the six forums. Defining a link between nodes (users) in a forum is nontrivial, so we consider three types of relationships: buddy, private message, and thread. Table 2 summarizes the basic social networking statistics for each forum.

### Buddy Links
Buddy links are the most explicit relationships, and they are directed since buddy requests may be accepted, pending, or denied. Accepted requests result in symmetric links, while pending requests produce unidirectional links. However, the number of explicitly declared buddy relationships across the forums is quite small, suggesting that underground forum users do not think of their relationships as persistent or see no utility in friending other users.

### Private Message Links
To capture latent relationships, we include links that result from private messaging. If user \( u_1 \) sends a PM to user \( u_2 \), we establish a directed link from \( u_1 \) to \( u_2 \).

### Thread Relationships
Thread relationships are established when two users post in the same sub-forum thread. We order all posts in the same thread by their post times and create a link from user \( u_2 \) to user \( u_1 \) if \( u_2 \) posted after \( u_1 \). Unsurprisingly, these one-to-many thread relationships produce the most links and fewest weakly connected components. More advanced techniques (e.g., parsing "[QUOTE]" and "@" expressions) could be used to establish finer-grained thread relationships, but we leave this to future work.

### Degree Distribution
Figure 1 shows the degree distribution for reciprocated links in both private message and thread relationships.
