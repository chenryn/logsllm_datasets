#### Adi Shamir (RSA)
- **On Decentralization:**
  - "Bitcoin was supposed to be a decentralized system, but it turns out that a few exchanges dominate the market. Almost no one can mine Bitcoins without purchasing very expensive ASICs, making the system highly centralized."
- **On Security:**
  - "The number of reported cases where Bitcoins are stolen from electronic wallets on computers indicates that currency on the Internet cannot be securely stored on the Internet, which is ironic."

#### Whit Diffie (Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange)
- **On Decentralization:**
  - "In its original vision, Bitcoin as a totally decentralized system was tremendously exciting. We have been pursuing decentralized, anonymous electronic banking for about three decades, and Bitcoin was a significant leap forward. However, centralization is hard to eliminate in any system."
- **On Design:**
  - "Bitcoin needn't be perfect; there are related designs that attempt to debug it. The kind of centralization you’re talking about is very difficult to eliminate in anything."

### Security Level and Cryptographic Standards

- **Security Level: 128 Bits (Complexity 2^128)**
- **NSA Suite B Cryptography:**
  - **ECDSA (Digital Signature):**
    - **Specification:** FIPS Pub 186-4
    - **Parameters:**
      - Curve P-256 for SECRET
      - Curve P-384 for TOP SECRET
  - **SHA (Hashing):**
    - **Specification:** FIPS Pub 180-4
    - **Parameters:**
      - SHA-256 for SECRET
      - SHA-384 for TOP SECRET

- **Strength of Bitcoin Cryptographic Primitives:**
  - Equivalent to protecting classified information of the USA government up to the SECRET level.
  - Most issues with Bitcoin arise from implementations, not the protocol itself.

### ECDSA and Random Number Generators (RNG)

- **ECDSA:**
  - **Ephemeral Key (k):** Critical for entropy, secrecy, and uniqueness.
  - **Risks:**
    - Using the same value twice, using a predictable value, or leaking even a few bits of k can break DSA/ECDSA.
  - **Examples:**
    - **Sony (December 2010):** Static k implementation led to the recovery of the ECDSA private key.
    - **Java (August 2013):** Bugs in `SecureRandom` generated collisions in k, allowing theft of bitcoins from Android wallets.
  - **Prevention:**
    - Deriving k deterministically from the private key and message hash, as described by RFC 6979.

### Side Channel Attacks (SCA)

- **Definition:**
  - Based on information gained from the physical implementation of a cryptosystem, such as timing, power consumption, electromagnetic leaks, or sound.
- **Countermeasures:**
  - Modern smart cards have countermeasures against Simple Power Analysis (SPA) and Differential Power Analysis (DPA).
  - Some newer ECC implementations may still leak information.

### Transaction Malleability

- **Issue:**
  - A known vulnerability in Bitcoin transactions, where transaction IDs can be altered, leading to potential double-spending attacks.
- **References:**
  - [Transaction Malleability Guide](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bug-guide-transaction-malleability)

### Bitcoin’s “Doomsday” (June 14, 2014)

- **GHash.io Pool:**
  - Concerns over a 51% attack, where a single mining pool controlled more than 50% of the network's hashing power.
- **Impact:**
  - Prices fell as Bitcoin confronted a doomsday scenario.

### Security of Bitcoin
