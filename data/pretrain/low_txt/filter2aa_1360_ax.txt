### Overcoming the Biggest Hurdle in Emulation

The most significant challenge in emulation has finally been addressed with an official fix, and an alternative solution is available for advanced users. Let's start with the simpler method using Genymotion's built-in Google features.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Installing Google Play Services

1. **Accessing Google Features:**
   - Open your virtual Android device.
   - Click the "Open GApps" icon in the upper right corner.
   - Accept the agreement and allow Google Apps to install.
   - Select the option to restart the device.

2. **Downloading GApps:**
   - Your browser should open to [https://opengapps.org/?source=genymotion](https://opengapps.org/?source=genymotion).
   - Select "ARM64", the version you created (e.g., 10.0.0), and "Stock".
   - Click the red download button in the lower right corner and save the file to your Desktop. Do not open the downloaded zip file.

3. **Installing GApps:**
   - Drag-and-drop the downloaded zip file into your running Android device.
   - Accept any warnings. You may encounter errors, but continue until the process is complete.
   - Close and restart the device.

4. **Verifying Installation:**
   - You should now see the Google Play Store in your applications menu.
   - Launch the Google Play Store and connect to an existing or new Google account. It is recommended to use an anonymous account that is not used for anything else.
   - Avoid creating a new account from within the virtual machine, as Google may require a cellular telephone number for verification. Instead, create the Google account on a traditional computer before connecting it to the virtual Android device.

5. **Syncing and Using the Play Store:**
   - After syncing with an active Google account, you should be able to enter the Google Play Store.
   - You should also see all core Google services in your applications menu.
   - You can now install any apps from the Play Store. If an app refuses to install due to incompatibility, consider using the F-Droid and Aurora Store technique explained in the previous tutorial.

### Navigating the Genymotion Interface

When you launch an Android virtual machine in Genymotion, you will see a column of icons on the right side of the window and a row of icons at the bottom. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of these features:

- **Bottom Icons (Emulated Android System):**
  - **Back Button:** Navigates you back one screen from your current location.
  - **Home Button:** Returns you to the home screen.
  - **Recent Apps Button:** Loads a view of recently opened applications.

- **Right-Side Icons (Genymotion Features):**
  - **GAPPS Indicator:** Confirms that Google Services are installed.
  - **GPS:** Enables and configures the current location reported to the device.
  - **Webcam:** Uses your computer's webcam for live video within an app.
  - **Remote Control, Identifiers, Disk I/O, Network Configuration, Phone, App Sharing, Pixel Configuration:** These features are not available in the free version.
  - **Volume Up/Down Buttons:** Adjusts the volume.
  - **Screen Rotate:** Flips your view into horizontal mode, similar to a tablet.
  - **Power Button:** Shuts down the device.

### Customizing GPS Settings

- **Enabling GPS:**
  - Click the GPS icon and toggle the Off/On switch.
  - You can either supply exact coordinates or select a location via an interactive Google map.
  - Set the altitude, accuracy, and bearing settings to "0" for optimal performance.
  - A green check mark in the GPS button confirms that your location settings are enabled.

### Creating and Maintaining Custom Search Tools

From 2010 to 2019, I offered a set of public, free, interactive online investigation tools. In June 2019, I was forced to remove these tools due to abuse and legal demands. However, I never agreed to prevent others from creating their own sets or offering downloadable copies that can be run locally from any computer. This chapter revisits these tools and offers several enhancements. The goal is to help you create and maintain your own custom search tools for automating queries in any investigation.

#### Why Custom Search Tools Are Important

- **Reliability:** Third-party tools can disappear or change without notice.
- **Privacy:** Many online search tools store and track your search activity.
- **Control:** Hosting your own tools ensures you have full control over your data.

#### Example: Email Search Tool

1. **Download the Templates:**
   - Visit [https://inteltechniques.com/osintbook9/tools.zip](https://inteltechniques.com/osintbook9/tools.zip) and download the archive.
   - Use the username "osint9" and password "bookl43wt" if required.
   - Unzip the archive to a destination of your choice.

2. **Understanding the Code:**
   - Open the `email.search.html` file in a text editor.
   - The following sections explain the key parts of the code:
     - **Title:** `<title>Email Search Tool</title>`
     - **Header End:** `</head>`
     - **JavaScript Command:** `function doPopAII(PopAII)...`
     - **Form Submission:** `<form onsubmit='doPopAII...'>`
     - **Search Function:** `function doSearch01(Search01)`
     - **URL Construction:** `{window.open('https://haveibeenpwned.com/unifiedsearch/' + SearchO1,'SearchO1 window');}`

3. **Modifying the Tool:**
   - Experiment with the style settings and JavaScript functions to customize the tool to your needs.
   - Ensure that the tool remains functional by testing it after making changes.

By following these steps, you can effectively overcome the challenges of emulation and create robust, reliable, and private search tools for your investigations.
