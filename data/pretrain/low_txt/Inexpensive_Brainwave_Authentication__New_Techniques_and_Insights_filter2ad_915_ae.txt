### Robustness of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)

Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) are more robust compared to continuous EEGs, as they are less sensitive to background noise. Despite variations in latency and amplitude due to external factors such as stress or tiredness, ERPs reflect stable morphological components like skull thickness [5, 63]. Further experiments in real-life conditions are needed to validate this hypothesis. In our experiments, we observed significant variability in the performance of different brainwave authentication tasks. We speculate that the number and quality of registered samples impact the results, but additional research is required to understand the factors contributing to this variability and how to mitigate their effects. Investigating the scalability of these results to larger populations would also be valuable.

### Usability Study

Our user study involved a sample of young, technically-savvy individuals. A more diverse and larger set of users would provide a more comprehensive understanding of usability issues in brainwave authentication systems. We described the system to participants in a realistic use case, explaining that they would need to complete one task from a set of tasks once a day, which would replace the need to type passwords for their applications. This description assumes a perfect implementation. The main methodological limitation is the reliance on self-reported qualitative feedback about intended future behavior based on participants' perceptions of the described system, which may not accurately reflect reality [39]. Our goal is to identify potential adoption barriers for brainwave-based authentication and to consider these when designing prototypes or conducting further experiments. To achieve ecological validity, it is essential to test and evaluate the actual usability of authentication prototypes in real-world scenarios.

### Conclusion

This study contributes to the literature on behavioral biometrics by providing the first comparative analysis of the usability and performance of brainwave authentication protocols based on endogenous Event-Related Potentials using consumer-grade EEG readers. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of authenticating users by recording brain activity while they view short sequences of visual stimuli (images or words). Users generally have a positive perception of such systems but emphasize the need for simpler headsets and faster authentication times. Based on participant feedback, extensive privacy research is necessary before brainwave-based applications become mainstream. Comparability with other studies is challenging due to differences in experimental conditions and performance reporting schemes, as well as small sample sizes (the majority ≤10). To address this, we contribute our dataset to improve the availability of samples and provide a common benchmark. The authentication community should strive to establish a consistent approach for communicating performance metrics.
