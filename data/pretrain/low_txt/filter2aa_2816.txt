### Introduction
We are here to introduce you to the world of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design. This process is not only easy and fun, but it also showcases your technical expertise.

### What is a PCB?
A PCB is a layered structure composed of:
- **Materials:** Typically copper and FR4 (a type of fiberglass-reinforced epoxy laminate).
- **Layers:** Ranging from 2 to 20 layers.
- **Purpose:** To layout and connect electronic components.

**Types:**
- **Prototype:** For initial testing and development.
- **Production:** For mass manufacturing.

### Working with Copper (Cu)
Copper in PCBs is used to:
- **Create electrical connections between components.**
- **Traces/Tracks:** Conductive paths on the surface.
- **Pours/Planes:** Large areas of copper for power and ground.
- **Vias:** Plated holes that connect different layers.

**Vias:**
- **Through Vias:** Connect all layers.
- **Blind Vias:** Connect an outer layer to an inner layer.
- **Buried Vias:** Connect two or more inner layers.

### Components
Components are essential for any circuit:
- **Definition:** A collection of pads or vias where chips or discrete parts connect to the board.
- **Footprint:** The physical space a component occupies on the PCB.

**Importance of Datasheets:**
- **Electrical Specifications:** Essential for proper component usage.
- **Usual Applications/Schematics:** Provide context and examples.
- **Footprint Sizes:** Ensure correct placement and fit.

**Consequences of Ignoring Datasheets:**
- Potential design flaws and functional issues.

### Design Rules
- **Fabrication Limits:** Machines have precision limits.
- **Cost Considerations:** Smaller features can be more expensive.
- **Tolerances:** Allow for manufacturing variations.
- **Design Rule Check (DRC):** Essential for ensuring manufacturability.

### Finishing Touches
- **Soldermask:** Protects the copper traces and prevents solder bridges.
- **Plating Metal:** Enhances conductivity and durability.
- **Silkscreen:** Adds labels and markings for easier assembly and debugging.

### Secrets of the Pros
- **Pad/Via/Through-Hole Sizing:** Make them slightly larger than necessary.
- **Through Hole Rule of Thumb:** Add +0.010” to the diameter.
- **Printouts:** Use 1:1 printouts to verify component fit.

### More Secrets
- **Capacitors:**
  - **Noise Reduction:** Filters out unwanted signals.
  - **Charge Storage:** Provides extra power when needed.
  - **Transfer Function Slicing:** Aids in signal processing.
  - **Versatility:** Useful in many other ways.
