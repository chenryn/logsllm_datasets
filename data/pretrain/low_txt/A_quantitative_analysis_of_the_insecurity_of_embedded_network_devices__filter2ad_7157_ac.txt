### Analysis of Vulnerable Embedded Devices

#### 1. Overview
- **Enterprise Networking Equipment**: Accounts for 43% of all discovered candidate embedded devices but only 6% of all vulnerable embedded devices.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Using the MaxMind GeoIP database, we categorized the discovered candidate and vulnerable embedded devices by continent. The distribution is shown in Figure 6, with detailed numbers and vulnerability rates provided in Table 4.

#### 2. Geographical Distribution
- **Asia**: 
  - Has the highest number of candidate embedded devices.
  - Accounts for approximately 80% of all discovered vulnerable embedded devices.
- **South Korea**: 
  - Contains the largest number of vulnerable embedded devices among all monitored nations.
- **North America**: 
  - 33% of all discovered candidate embedded devices are located here.
  - Only 12% of all vulnerable embedded devices are found in this region.

  - ISP: 2,374
  - Private Enterprise: 4,070
  - Government: 494
  - Unidentified: 9,118

- **Vulnerability Rates by Organization Type**:
  - Educational: 32.83%
  - ISP: 17.43%
  - Private Enterprise: 16.40%
  - Government: 10.38%
  - Unidentified: 2.54%

- **Total Devices by Organization Type**:
  - Educational: 156,992
  - ISP: 2,095,292
  - Private Enterprise: 554,101
  - Government: 44,460
  - Unidentified: 1,103,775

- **Key Observations**:
  - ISP networks contain the most candidate embedded devices and house over 68% of all discovered vulnerable embedded devices.
  - Educational networks have a modest number of candidate embedded devices but the highest per-category vulnerability rate (32.83%).

#### 5. Community Response to Default Credential Scanner Activity
- **Scanner Design**: The scanner directs visitors to a public webpage describing the project's intent and methodology.
- **Webpage Access**: Tracked using Google Analytics, with a significant spike in October 2009 coinciding with the publication of an article on preliminary results.
- **Email Correspondences**:
  - Total Conversations: 36
  - Opt-Out Requests: 14
  - Request for Information, but Not Opt-Out: 22
  - Tone of Counter-Party: Supportive (14), Neutral (15), Hostile (7)

#### 6. Preliminary Longitudinal Results
- **Retested Devices**: 102,896 vulnerable embedded devices were retested.
- **Current Status**:
  - 54,429 devices are still publicly accessible.
  - 52,661 devices remain vulnerable.
  - Approximately 96.75% of accessible vulnerable devices are still vulnerable after 4 months.
  - Factory default credentials have been removed from only 3.25% of the devices.

#### 7. Remediation Strategy
- **Immediate Mitigation**: Discontinue the use of well-known default credentials.
- **Challenges**: High cost and the need to address legacy devices.
- **ISP Engagement**: ISPs centrally manage large numbers of vulnerable devices and are ideal candidates for engagement.
- **Long-term Solution**: Develop methods for delivering effective host-based protection to proprietary embedded devices running heterogeneous operating systems.
- **Proposed Solution**: Parasitic Embedded Machines (PEM) developed by the Columbia Intrusion Detection Systems Lab.

#### 8. Conclusion and Future Work
- **Key Findings**: Large population of trivially vulnerable embedded devices, with a high percentage remaining vulnerable over time.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Engage key groups and develop new security measures.
- **Future Research**: Continue to monitor and mitigate the embedded security threat.
