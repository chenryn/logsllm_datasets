(Actually, Who, How, Where, What)

**Doug Mohney - Background**
- Over two decades of experience in the ICT sector
- Contributed to Boardwatch, The Inquirer, VON Magazine (Pulvermedia), and TMC
- Began covering HD voice in May 2009
- Launched HD Voice News (HD Connect Now) in August 2009

### The 2009 HD Voice Wake-Up Call
- **France Telecom Deployments:**
  - **Broadband:** Over 500,000 G.722 VoIP endpoints
  - **Mobile:** AMR-WB deployed in Moldova
- **Global Crossing:**
  - Built an HD conference bridge for a customer
  - Working on an open HD conferencing bridge
- **Verizon Business:**
  - Nearly 5,000 phones at headquarters
  - Expects early adopters in 2010, with general availability in 2011
- **Cablevision (Optimum Lightpath):**
  - Deployed a hosted HD voice service in the second half of 2009

### Observations
- The United States is lagging behind other countries in telecommunications technology.
- U.S. carriers may wait for others to complete R&D before adopting HD voice.

### Key Players in the HD Voice Ecosystem
- **IP Desktop Handset Manufacturers:**
  - Aastra, AudioCodes, Avaya, Cisco, Polycom
- **Mobile Handset Manufacturers:**
  - Nokia, Sony Ericsson, and any with Android & 4G, with more expected
- **Network Core:**
  - Aculab, Dialogic, D2 Technologies, Ericsson, Trinity Convergence
- **Applications:**
  - BroadSoft, CommuniGate, Unisys, WYDEVoice
- **Service Providers:**
  - Cablevision, France Telecom, 8x8, ooma, WorldGate

### What is HD Voice?
- **Narrowband Voice:**
  - Acoustic standards set in 1937
  - PSTN-grade call = 3.4 kHz range (300 Hz to 3400 Hz)
  - G.711 codec for VoIP, 64 kbps bandwidth
- **HD Voice:**
  - Also known as wideband voice
  - Sampling range of at least 7 kHz, twice that of G.711
  - Baseline codec: G.722 (30 Hz to 7000 Hz, 64 kbps)
  - Other codecs: AMR-WB, SILK, GIPS iSAC

### Benefits of HD Voice
- **Reduction of Fatigue:**
  - Less brain strain due to more data
  - Improved clarity in long conference calls
- **Better Compensation and Clarity:**
  - Clearer distinction between similar-sounding words
  - Reduced need to repeat or spell out acronyms

### Implementation of HD Voice
- **Typically an All-IP Application:**
  - Requires capable speakers and microphones
  - SIP for interoperability
  - Good QoS and low latency are essential
- **Interconnecting with the PSTN and Other HD Voice Users:**
  - Transcoding between different codecs
  - Direct interconnection via SIP for the same codec types

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Island Problem:**
  - Security, ENUM overhead, QoS, and settlements
  - Many HD voice islands in enterprises and service providers
- **Building Bridges:**
  - Direct peering between service providers
  - IP Peering Alliance and Cloud Communications Alliance
  - Hub-and-spoke networks managed by service providers

### HD Voice Codecs
- **G.722:**
  - Based on G.711, patents expired
- **AMR-WB (G.722.2):**
  - Cellular industry standard, 24 kbps for HD
  - Patent fees apply
- **iSAC:**
  - Proprietary by Global IP Solutions (GIPS), now owned by Google
  - Licensed by AOL, Yahoo, QQ, Nimbuzz, WebEx, IBM Lotus, Citrix Online
- **SILK:**
  - Developed by Skype, royalty-free
  - Variable bit-rate adaptability
- **Other Codecs:**
  - G.722.1 (Polycom Siren), Fraunhofer ACE, Speex, Broadcom BroadVoice

### Why People Fight Over Codecs
- **Hardware Designers:**
  - Simplicity and fewer codecs reduce testing and support costs
- **Wireless Industry:**
  - RF bandwidth conservation, but less critical with 3G/4G
- **Network Core:**
  - More codecs mean more transcoding, which can degrade quality
- **Developers:**
  - Preference for creating better solutions

### Applications Benefiting from HD Voice
- **Conferencing:**
  - Clarity, reduced stress, better voice identification
- **Multinational Conversations:**
  - Improved understanding for non-native speakers
- **Transcription:**
  - Fewer errors, easier human transcription

### Current Implementations
