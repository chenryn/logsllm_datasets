### Owner and Group Permission Storage Overhead

For an Access Control List (ACL) with up to 95 and 1119 entries, a 10 MB plaintext file requires 10.11 MB and 10.15 MB of encrypted storage, respectively. This corresponds to a relative storage overhead of 1.12% and 1.48%. Similarly, a 200 MB plaintext file requires 202.09 MB and 202.13 MB of encrypted storage, corresponding to a relative overhead of 1.05% and 1.06%.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce SeGShare, an end-to-end encrypted group file sharing solution designed for large and dynamic groups using trusted execution environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX. SeGShare ensures the confidentiality and integrity of content files, file system structure, permissions, and existing group memberships. Key features include:

- Immediate revocation of permissions and membership.
- Support for deduplication.
- Mitigation of rollback attacks.
- Separation of authentication and authorization.
