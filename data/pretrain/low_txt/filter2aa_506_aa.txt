## JORDAN SANTARSIERI
**Founder of Vicxer**

Originally focused on Penetration Testing, Vulnerability Research, and Exploit Writing, Jordan has discovered numerous vulnerabilities in Oracle, SAP, IBM, and many other systems. He is a frequent speaker and trainer at various cybersecurity conferences, including Black Hat, OWASP-US, Hacker Halted, YSTS, Insomni'hack, AusCERT, Sec-T, RootCon, and Ekoparty.

Since 2008, Jordan has been researching ERP software and has had the honor of securing over 1,000 SAP implementations globally, including Fortune 500 companies, military institutions, and the world's largest NGOs.

### CHAPTER 01: A Brief Introduction to SAP

#### WHAT IS SAP?
- SAP stands for Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing. It is a German company founded in 1972 by former IBM employees.
- SAP employs over 88,500 people worldwide and serves more than 378,000 customers across 180+ countries.
- SAP dominates the market, with 87% of the Forbes Global 2000 companies using their solutions.

#### SAP SOLUTIONS
- **Enterprise Solutions:**
  - SAP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
  - SAP BI (Business Intelligence)
  - SAP CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
  - SAP SRM (Supplier Relationship Management)

- **Supporting Solutions:**
  - SAP GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)
  - SAP Business Objects
  - SAP Mobile
  - SAP Cloud Connectors

These solutions provide direct services to end users and support the operations of the enterprise solutions.

#### SAP NETWEAVER
- SAP NetWeaver is the framework on which SAP applications are built. It synchronizes and regulates the operation of different SAP components.
- NetWeaver is service-oriented and divided into two stacks: ABAP and J2EE.
- Each stack offers various services, some of which are shared between the stacks, while others are unique. These services use both open and proprietary communication protocols.

#### SAP USER CLIENTS
- There are multiple ways for users to connect to SAP systems, including:
  - **SAP GUI:** A proprietary protocol, extra-thick client, approximately 1.4 GB in size.
  - **SAP Web Application Servers:** ICM, Java HTTP, XSA.

### WHY ATTACK SAP IMPLEMENTATIONS?
- The primary motivation for attacking SAP implementations is the potential access to critical business data and processes.

### CHAPTER 02: Project ARSAP is Born

#### ABOUT US

- Our clients include Fortune 500 companies.
- Services offered:
  - Oracle & SAP Penetration Testing
  - Cybersecurity Training
  - Vulnerability Assessment and Management
  - SAP Forensics

#### PROJECT ARSAP
- As a young company, we faced the challenge of generating new leads. Instead of the traditional approach of buying lists and cold calling, we decided to innovate.
- We used search engines like Shodan, Google, Bing, and ZoomEye, as well as deep-web resources, to find exposed SAP systems (ABAP, Java, Business Objects, HANA).
- We created an "extractor" for each data source to maintain a dynamic map of SAP systems.
- We categorized and tagged the detected SAP systems based on exposed services, country, continent, SSL support, and versions.
- We identified the owners of 37.86% of the detected assets and classified them based on potential risk using our vulnerability database.

#### ARSAP BY THE NUMBERS
- We found over 14,000 SAP services.
- At least 27% of the detected assets were potentially vulnerable to critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, such as Remote Code Execution (RCE), Directory Traversal, Arbitrary File Uploads, and Arbitrary File Reads.

### CHAPTER 03: A Traditional Approach to Malware Distribution

#### THINKING LIKE AN ATTACKER
- With the information gathered, an attacker could easily enumerate email addresses of employees at the target company.
- Knowing that the company uses SAP, the attacker can infer that it has significant resources and a large number of employees.
- Many large companies use Single Sign-On (SSO) for SAP access, making it easier to exploit.

#### SAP GUI SCRIPTING
- SAP GUI Scripting is an automation interface that enhances the capabilities of SAP GUI, allowing users to automate repetitive tasks.
- By default, SAP GUI scripting is disabled, but in our experience, 90% of corporate users enable this functionality for performance and functional testing.
- An attacker can send an email with a malicious SAP GUI script attached, leveraging the victim's privileges to delete critical data, such as a table containing public debt.

### WEAPONIZATION
- The distribution channel for the malware is an email with a malicious SAP GUI script.
- The attacker will use the victim's privileges to perform actions, such as deleting a table containing public debt, in a Robin Hood-style attack.
