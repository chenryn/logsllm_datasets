### Security Properties and the SNID Fix

Adopting the SNID fix ensures that security properties A2, A5, and A6 are achieved. However, we were unable to achieve termination for A7.

### Discussion: Strengthening the Protocol (AStronger)

Our analysis has shown that the integrity of each core component is crucial for maintaining both secrecy and authentication properties. All components significantly influence whether the protocol achieves its intended security goals. For the "Not-My-X" scenario, our analysis underscores the importance of explicitly including the SNID in the authenticated portion of the protocol's messages.

Compromise of secure channels can have a devastating effect on security. Dolev-Yao-like channel compromise allows an adversary to violate most security properties. While read-only access does not enable the adversary to break many agreement properties between 5G core components, it does allow the adversary to violate almost all agreement properties from the UE’s perspective. This new information enables the adversary to impersonate a serving or home network successfully over the insecure UE ↔ SEAF channel.

The 5G specification mandates lawful intercept capability, whether enabled or not. Older methods for implementing this are described in TS 33.106 [6]. The 5G-specific methods are outlined in TS 33.842 [2], which, as of November 2017, is a skeletal document with little detail. If lawful intercept is implemented by providing law enforcement with read-only access to one of the channels, our analysis suggests that law enforcement could also gain the power to impersonate, violating the principle of least privilege. Given these subtleties, it is advisable to explicitly incorporate any lawful intercept mechanisms into the security analysis of the protocol. This ensures that the additional mechanism provides only what is required by law without inadvertently granting further capabilities. Analyses like ours are suitable for this purpose.

While the 5G-AKA protocol meets its desired security properties after incorporating our proposed fixes, it remains a fragile protocol. 5G-AKA quickly loses the ability to uphold most of its desired properties upon the compromise of almost anything outside its relatively weak threat model, compared to most modern key-exchange protocols.

### Attack Implications, Disclosure, and Impact on TS 33.501

The secrecy violation described in Section VIII-A allows an adversary to impersonate another user to a serving network. From the perspective of 5G-AKA, this enables the attacker to dishonestly agree on an anchor key, gaining serving network access under newly generated false credentials of a legitimate user. This is a significant containment problem. The attack relies on a race condition between two sessions of the protocol and is probabilistic; however, in any secure protocol, there should not exist any run of the protocol adhering to the threat model that violates the security properties.

#### Potential Practical Implications

In the real world, we conjecture that this attack might allow an attacker to access a serving network in the name of a legitimate user other than itself. This attacker could then bill services, air-time, or access charges to another user, which is clearly not the intended behavior or level of security required. We are not confident about the range of further authentication and authorization procedures that may or may not be in place distinct from the 5G-AKA protocol. An ARPF would be able to establish that the anchor key was not for the correct user, but an AUSF or any other party without direct access to the honest user’s long-term key K would not. We believe it is plausible that once access is granted in the form of an anchor key, this key is sufficient to allow a user to perform the normal range of actions within a network.

We acknowledge that there may be other technical measures within any real-world 5G network that make full implementation of this attack impossible. Regardless, we believe that any authentication and key agreement protocol must meet its own required security properties. The real-world practicality of this attack will depend on carrier-specific implementations, which are not publicly available. This makes it difficult to provide evidence of practicality, but we believe this research shows that we could easily create a 'correct' implementation of the standard that makes the attack feasible. With access to a range of 5G implementations, we hypothesize that we would find vulnerable instances.

The strongest statement we can definitively make is that the 5G-AKA protocol on its own does not meet its security requirements. As the primary method for authentication and key agreement within 5G, we believe that 5G networks should not rely solely on secondary mechanisms for security. This is sufficient reason to fix the protocol to prevent this and similar attacks.

### Liaison with 3GPP SA3 and CT4

At the time of writing, 5G (and 5G-AKA) is not yet an implemented, used, or complete standard. Our publication aims to highlight issues during the standardization phase rather than after it has been finalized. Consequently, we communicated directly with the relevant working groups.

After discovering the secrecy violation, we prepared a document describing the vulnerability, its potential implications, and our proposed fix. We then contacted members of the 3GPP SA3 (Security) working group, informing them of our research and requesting their feedback.

Following the document’s distribution, we received mostly supportive feedback from SA3 members and other researchers. Some SA3 members did not view the vulnerability as an issue with TS 33.501, suggesting that individual vendors could introduce further measures to guarantee security if they desired. We respectfully but strongly disagree.

Senior security experts from a global carrier helped us prepare a Change Request [27] to TS 33.501, which they submitted on our behalf to 3GPP SA3. As a result of our publicly released document and change request, SA3 stated that they believe our described race condition could arise and that they need to ensure its mitigation. This has resulted in a formal liaison document detailing our described mis-binding and how it could lead to parties being “unable to correlate the different responses to the respective requests” [17].

The liaison document requests 3GPP working group CT4 to confirm whether they agree that this lack of binding is present, whether it has been taken into account, and if so, how the race condition is avoided. Finally, the document attaches a change request by another global carrier, which is proposed as a solution. This is a generic adaptation of our proposed fix from Section IX-A.

### Conclusions

In this research, we have demonstrated issues within the draft 5G-AKA protocol, particularly one that, if unmitigated, could potentially allow a malicious actor to impersonate an honest user to a network. We propose a possible fix and have verified its correctness using the TAMARIN Prover. We have worked with 3GPP, encouraging them to adopt our proposed fix, and are pleased with the progress made.

Our results highlight the importance of fine-grained, component-based formal modeling. Without this level of detail, we would not have discovered the presented race condition. We recognize that standards often make implicit assumptions about engineering solutions, and there may be other mechanisms in place that mitigate the real-world impact of this protocol vulnerability. However, security-critical properties of any protocol must not depend on implicit engineering solutions. The specification of a standard should be such that any correct implementation provides the desired security properties. This is not true for the modeled TS 33.501 v0.7.0, [5], or the latest version at the time of writing, v15.1.0.

Many of the encountered issues are exacerbated by continued reliance on symmetric cryptography. Future standards could achieve much stronger security properties in authentication and secrecy with the introduction of a modern, asymmetric key-exchange mechanism at the core of any new ‘AKA’ protocol.

Identity binding and protocol design are challenging, especially within complex, multi-party protocols with subtle assumptions. The discovery of these issues further demonstrates the importance of systematic automated verification for security-critical functionality and protocols.

Finally, we emphasize the importance of communication between academia and industry. If 3GPP had taken into account previous research, such as Tsay and Mjølsnes [26], our presented vulnerability could have been avoided. When we contacted 3GPP with our report, no reply mentioned this previous research. While the implications of some of the issues we discuss can be subtle and tricky to convey, we need to ensure these can still be communicated to industry clearly and accurately. It is important to continue analyzing systems, providing feedback to the relevant stakeholders, and ensuring that our research is received, read, and acted upon.
