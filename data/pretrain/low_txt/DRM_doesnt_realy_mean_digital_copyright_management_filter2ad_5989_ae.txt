The Giovanni system is arguably more favorable for those seeking to maintain fair use and access in traditional information markets. It offers critical functionalities that align with the societal value of copyright, such as archiving, maintaining author information, and ensuring no inherent restrictions on access. The fundamental concept is to allow people to view content without assuming each viewer intends to engage in a criminal act, which is a principle embedded in copyright.

Giovanni provides essential functions of copyright. It maintains copies as an archive and ensures that users who have purchased services can alter the format of the material to keep it up-to-date. If watermarking allows for a history of use, similar to how this document embeds references and quotations from other works, Giovanni can facilitate the creation of complex, hyperlinked, and trustworthy documents. This depends on the existence of homomorphisms in the watermarking system and the sample size necessary to extract attribute data. Currently, Giovanni requires 7 seconds of CD-quality sound or 104 pixels to extract watermarked data. Watermarks can also be used to identify annotations in individual copies.

However, Giovanni does not provide a tree-like mechanism to trace the interrelationships between documents. With market dominance, it could potentially offer something akin to citeseer (http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/).

Embedding consumer information assumes that only the consumer would release the data and does not address the possibility of data theft. In the event of data theft, the consumer is subject to the inherent punishment of exposure of sensitive information. Given that identity theft can cost victims thousands of dollars and take an average of 18 months to recover, this punishment is unlikely to be sustainable as a policy. While the feature is optional, the choice is left to the producer, who can select the level of risk for the customer without their input. This option also precludes the ability to read anonymously.

### Does Blue Spike Solve the Problem of Persistent Storage or Search?

The question with respect to Giovanni is whether a single company can serve the role of a Royal Library—providing effective copyright protection, archiving, and access. Among all the systems, Giovanni is the closest to serving the functions of the copyright system for digital content.

### Conclusions

Copyright is a set of narrow legal rights built on a technologically deterministic foundation and embedded in a particular economic system. By extracting the functions of the technology, law, and economics, we can return to first principles for designing DRM systems. The set of functions, which I refer to as "copy accuracy" to distinguish it from copyright per se, is not entirely provided by any DRM system. Systems that fall under the rubric of copyright today, by virtue of protecting content, sometimes enhance the market element of copy accuracy but at the expense of other functions of the copyright system. Similarly, code that breaks content control mechanisms enhances some functions of copyright while undermining others.

It is commonly asserted that authors want to be remunerated with a combination of reputation and wealth. If information can be said to have a desire, then information wants to be used and trusted. The increasing value of the readers' attention span should also be considered in the information economy. Neither those who seek to manage authors' rights nor the defenders of access rights are entirely aligned with the purposes of copyright, as no system motivates and rewards filtering, rating, and distribution.

No DRM or DRM circumvention system implements personal, persistent annotation with integrity. This is related to the fact that no DRM or DRM circumvention system rewards filtering. It is worth noting that some peer-to-peer systems, often decried as an assault on copyright, are designed such that filtering is intrinsic to the system (e.g., Napster).

Future work will entail examining more digital rights management systems. The most interesting question is designing a system that fully fulfills the functions identified here as copy accuracy. These extensions of the work are currently being addressed in ongoing research.
