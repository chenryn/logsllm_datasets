## 5.3.2 Hosting Infrastructure
In this section, we provide a detailed analysis of the internet infrastructure used by both mobile threats. Table 8 summarizes the autonomous systems (AS), country codes (CC), and the number of hosts within each AS that were pointed to over the lifecycle of the threats.

### Host Changes Over Time
Figure 12 illustrates the changes in the host pointed to by `qnameǫ` over time. The host was primarily located in AS 6389, but there were brief periods when the domain resolved to hosts outside AS 6389. By comparing the activity of threat ǫ (Figure 10) with the changes in the host (Figure 12), it is evident that host changes were correlated with activity peaks, such as the one observed in April 2011.

Similarly, Figure 13 shows the host changes over time for threat β. Like threat ǫ, the host infrastructure was relatively stable until peak activity (January–June 2011). These changes may have been made to add redundancy to the command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure as it grew.

### Key Insights
These case studies provide three key insights into the lifecycle of mobile threats:
1. **Detection Lag**: In the case of threat ǫ, the malicious app was not publicly disclosed until months after its peak activity. This indicates that reactive security measures failed to detect the threat until well after it was most effective.
2. **Growth Patterns**: Both threats exhibit growth patterns similar to those observed in non-mobile malware studies [8].
3. **Agility in Hosting Infrastructure**: The hosting infrastructure used by these threats does not resemble professional DNS hosting. Instead, they are similar to non-mobile botnet operators who commonly use tactics like moving to hosts in different networks and countries to provide agility to their illicit operations.

### Future Work
The agility seen in these mobile threats could be exploited by traditional DNS reputation systems to detect potentially suspicious domain names in the mobile space.

## 6 Related Work
As society becomes more reliant on mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and mobile broadband cards, the importance of mobile networks is increasing. Several studies have examined mobile device network traffic to understand the general network characteristics of these devices [19, 24, 18]. Past research has shown that certain design considerations have made these networks inherently vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. For example, Traynor et al. [41, 42] proposed a text messaging DoS attack using only the bandwidth of a cable modem, highlighting a growing class of vulnerabilities due to the intertwined connectivity between the Internet and traditional voice networks.

Other work has demonstrated that the use of data communication protocols on voice networks can create the potential for failure under modest loads [35, 44, 43, 40]. Consequently, significant effort has been directed towards analyzing potentially malicious mobile applications. Numerous studies have highlighted the weaknesses and potential for misuse of various aspects of the Android security model [16, 23, 20, 22, 12]. Other work on Android devices suggests that it is difficult to determine if an application breaks any phone-wide security policies [17], leading to the development of tools to aid in the analysis of Android applications [14, 15]. Additional studies have surveyed the types of malware seen in the wild and evaluated the efficacy of different techniques in preventing and identifying such threats in the future [21].

However, app analysis alone provides an incomplete picture of the current state of malware on mobile devices and networks. Network-level analysis of malicious behavior offers a complementary means of characterizing and mitigating malware. For example, a popular method of preventing or limiting the spread of malware is the use of Internet blacklists. IP blacklists provide a list of known bad actors in the form of IP addresses, which network operators can subsequently block. However, the use of DNS to build malicious network infrastructures has grown due to its resilience against IP blacklisting [36, 37]. Consequently, a significant amount of work has focused on analyzing those networks at the DNS level [27, 45, 29, 13, 25]. This has led to the creation of systems that can detect malicious domains through passive DNS monitoring and machine learning [7, 10]. Furthermore, recent work has shown that detection of malicious domains can also be accomplished by passively monitoring DNS at the upper levels of the DNS hierarchy, allowing DNS operators to independently detect malicious domains without relying on local recursive DNS servers [8].

Ultimately, these systems allow network operators to assemble DNS blacklists of malicious and suspicious domains to detect and prevent malicious activity on the network. Although considerable effort has been targeted towards detecting network malware, it has primarily focused on traditional wired networks. The question of whether such threats differ or even exist in real mobile networks remains to be evaluated through empirical results.

## 7 Conclusions
In this paper, we presented a study of traffic obtained from a major US cellular provider and a major US non-cellular Internet service provider. Our work provides an in-depth understanding of the internet infrastructure used for mobile malware. We showed that the network infrastructure used by mobile applications is part of the core internet infrastructure used by applications in the non-cellular world; in other words, the mobile web is part of the Internet. We presented evidence showing that the mobile malware discovered by the research community appears in a minuscule number of devices in the network, suggesting that mobile application markets are already providing adequate security for a majority of mobile devices.

We compared traffic to suspicious hosts between different mobile device platforms and demonstrated that iOS devices are no less likely than other platforms to reach out to such devices. Finally, we analyzed two major mobile threats and found that their network characteristics are similar to those of non-cellular botnets. Overall, these findings suggest that there are commonalities, in terms of both network infrastructure and characteristics, between malicious mobile applications and non-cellular malware. Therefore, we should leverage our successful experiences with DNS monitoring and reputation systems for non-cellular ISPs to develop a similar system for cellular carriers to identify (emerging) mobile threats. We leave this as future work.
