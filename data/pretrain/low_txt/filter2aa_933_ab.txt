## Preface

This book is the culmination of over two and a half years of research into various types of antivirus software. Our objective was to understand and evaluate the effectiveness of different antivirus solutions in providing endpoint protection. Through our research, we observed numerous patterns and behaviors related to how antivirus software is built, its internal workings, and its detection capabilities.

As creators, we strive to develop intelligent and sophisticated systems, but it's essential to acknowledge that perfection is unattainable. This applies to antivirus software as well. As we evolve, learn from our mistakes, and improve, so too must antivirus software and other protective systems adapt and evolve to counter ever-increasing cyber threats.

This book aims to highlight the importance of continuous learning and improvement. By demonstrating how antivirus software can be bypassed, we hope to provide insights that will help in securing code at the source level and improving detection mechanisms to prevent future bypasses.

While we present cases where we bypassed many antivirus solutions, this does not necessarily imply that these solutions are ineffective. We do not recommend any specific antivirus software in this book.

### Section 1: Know the Antivirus – the Basics Behind Your Security Solution
In this section, we explore the fundamentals of antivirus software, the engines behind it, and the research approaches used to bypass and evade it.

#### Chapter 1: Introduction to the Security Landscape
This chapter provides an overview of the connected world and the increasing sophistication of cybercriminals. It examines the common misconception that antivirus software provides complete protection and introduces the types of antivirus engines and bypass techniques.

##### Understanding the Security Landscape
The internet has become the primary medium for transferring ideas and data. With the digital transformation, cybercrime has also grown exponentially. Cybercriminals target sensitive information for financial gain, and various security solutions have been developed to combat these threats.

##### Defining Malware
Malware, or malicious software, is designed to infiltrate and cause damage to endpoints. Common types include viruses, worms, rootkits, downloaders, ransomware, botnets, backdoors, PUPs, droppers, scareware, trojans, and spyware.

##### Exploring Protection Systems
Antivirus software is the most basic type of protection against malware. Other security solutions include EDR, firewalls, IDS/IPS, and DLP.

##### Antivirus – the Basics
Antivirus software detects and prevents the spread of malicious files and processes. Modern antivirus engines include static, dynamic, heuristic, and unpacking engines, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

By understanding these components, we can better appreciate the complexities and challenges in creating effective antivirus solutions.
