### 8. Soundness Analysis

First, observe that in a sufficiently large field, the probability of certain events is negligible. Given \( c'(X) = s(u, X) \), a PPT (Probabilistic Polynomial-Time) algebraic adversary can only open \( C \) at a specific (not randomly chosen) value \( y_j \) to \( s(u, y_j) \). Furthermore, the probability that \( s'_j(X) = s(u, y_j) \) for a randomly chosen \( u \) but \( s'_j(X) \neq s(X, y_j) \) is also negligible in a sufficiently large field. Thus, soundness follows from the evaluation binding property of the polynomial commitment.

### 9. Implementation

To compare the concrete performance of our construction with other protocols, we provide an open-source implementation in Rust [1] of Sonic implemented with helpers. We chose to implement this variant of Sonic because it offers better practical efficiency. The numbers in Table 4 were obtained on a CPU i7 2600K with 32 GB of RAM, running at 3.4 GHz.

In terms of our parameters, we use the BLS12-381 elliptic curve construction, which is designed such that its group order is a prime \( p \) and \( \mathbb{F}_p \) is equipped with large 2n roots of unity. This allows for efficient fast Fourier transforms (FFT) for polynomial multiplications. BLS12-381 targets the 128-bit security level. Kim and Babalescu [51] describe an optimization to the Number Field Sieve algorithm, further analyzed by Babalescu and Duquesne [3], which may reduce the security to 117 bits. However, this attack requires an (currently unknown) efficient algorithm for scanning a large space of polynomials.

Proof verification is dominated by a set of pairing equation checks and an evaluation of \( s(X, Y) \) in the scalar field. Most pairings within (and among many) proof verifications involve fixed elements in \( G_2 \), so the verifier can combine all of them into a single equation with a probabilistic check. In the context of batch verification, each individual proof thus requires arithmetic only in \( G_1 \). Only a small, fixed number of pairing operations are performed at the end.

As mentioned in Section 8, the evaluation of \( s(X, Y) \) can be done once for a batch of proofs given some post-processing by an untrusted helper. We consider the performance of batch verification with this post-processing.

In each individual proof, we must compute \( k(y) \) depending on our instance. We keep this polynomial sparse by having coefficients only in our instance variables and keeping all other coefficients zero. If constants are needed in the circuit, they are expressed with coefficients of an instance variable that is fixed to one.

We provide an adaptor which translates circuits written in the form of quadratic "rank-1 constraint systems" (R1CS) [11], a widely deployed NP language currently undergoing standardization, into the system of constraints natural to our proving system. This adds some constant overhead during proving and verifying steps but eases implementation and comparison with existing constructions.

The numbers obtained are relevant only to batched proofs, so we wrote an idealized verifier of the Groth 2016 scheme [45], where a batch of proofs are verified together. In this idealized version, we assume the \( G_2 \) elements do not need to be deserialized and that there is only one public input. We found the marginal cost of verification was around 0.6 ms, compared to Sonic’s 0.7 ms. Therefore, we claim that Sonic has verification time competitive with the state-of-the-art for zk-SNARKs, but unlike prior zk-SNARKs, it has a universal and updatable SRS.

In Table 4, we mimicked Bulletproofs [26, Table 3] in measuring the results of our Sonic implementation. Our implementation is not constant-time, which may affect this comparison (or indeed the comparison of prover performance to any implementation with constant-time algorithms). We measured the efficiency of the prover, the verifier, and the helped verifier in proving knowledge of \( x \) such that \( H(x) = y \). Proof sizes are always 256 bytes, and verifier computation is always around 0.7 ms. In Bulletproofs, in contrast, the proof size for the unpadded 512-bit SHA256 preimage is 1376 bytes, and verification time is 41.52 ms. However, this comparison is not exact, particularly because their system was throttled to 2 GHz and there are optimized implementations for fixed circuits. The runtime of our prover increases in a roughly linear fashion, as expected. The cost of the helped verifier, in contrast, remains the same for all circuit sizes.

### 10. Conclusions

Zero-knowledge protocols have gained significant traction in recent years, especially in the application domain of cryptocurrencies. This has led to the development of new protocols with significant performance gains. At the same time, the requirements of this application have given rise to protocols with new features, such as an untrusted setup and a reference string that allows one to prove more than a single relation. In this paper, we present Sonic, which captures a valuable set of trade-offs between these key functional requirements of untrusted setup and universality. As demonstrated via a prototype implementation, Sonic has proof sizes and verification times that are competitive with the state-of-the-art.
