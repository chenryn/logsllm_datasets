### Wearable Devices with Strict Size and Weight Constraints

Wearable devices often face stringent limitations in terms of size and weight. In our prototype, the piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) we used, specifically the Volture V25W, costs approximately $157. In contrast, the electromagnetic energy harvester (EEH) we utilized is priced at around $37.50. Although bulk purchasing can significantly reduce these costs, the PEH remains more expensive than the EEH.

### Factors Affecting Gait Recognition

Several factors can influence the accuracy of a gait-based recognition system, including the type of shoes, clothing, walking speed, and terrain. Previous studies have shown that the accuracy decreases when the training and testing samples are collected under different conditions, such as varying shoe types and clothing [36]. For instance, in Section VI-E, the accuracy of KEH-Gait dropped when session 1 was used for training and session 2 for testing. The dataset used in this experiment is particularly challenging, as it includes natural gait changes over time (two sessions separated by one week) and variations due to changes in clothing, terrain, and shoes. Despite these challenges, KEH-Gait achieved accuracies of 95% and 89% on the two datasets, respectively, using the proposed Multi-Session Sparse Representation Classification (MSSRC). This demonstrates the robustness of KEH-Gait to gait variations.

### Related Work

#### Gait Recognition

Gait recognition has been extensively studied and can be categorized into three main groups: vision-based, floor sensor-based, and wearable sensor-based. Vision-based systems capture gait from a distance using video cameras and employ image processing techniques to extract gait features [39, 40, 41, 42]. Floor sensor-based systems use sensors installed under the floor to measure ground reaction forces (GRF) or heel-to-toe ratios [43, 44].

Compared to vision-based and other non-accelerometer-based methods, acceleration data more directly and faithfully reflect the dynamics of gait. Accelerometer-based gait recognition does not suffer from issues like occlusions, clutter, and viewpoint changes. Early works in this area include those by Ailisto et al. [8] and Gafurov et al. [45], who used dedicated accelerometers worn on various body positions. With the rise of smartphones, researchers have developed gait-based authentication systems using built-in accelerometers [48, 4, 49]. Additionally, some studies have explored the use of shoe-embedded piezoelectric energy harvesters for gait analysis [50, 51].

#### Studies on Kinetic Energy Harvesting (KEH)

While there has been significant research on wearable sensors, most existing products rely on battery power, which requires frequent recharging and replacement. To address this, researchers are exploring the use of KEH to power a wide range of applications, including activity tracking [15, 52] and health monitoring [53]. For example, Khalifa et al. [15] proposed using the energy harvesting power signal for human activity recognition, achieving 83% accuracy. Lan et al. [53] conducted an experimental study using the output voltage signal from a PEH to estimate calorie expenditure, showing promising results. Building on this, KEH-Gait utilizes the voltage signal generated by kinetic energy harvesters to perform gait recognition, thereby reducing power consumption by eliminating the need for an accelerometer.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using KEH to address user spoofing attacks in emerging mobile healthcare systems. We present KEH-Gait, a kinetic energy harvesting signal-based gait recognition system for user authentication. By not using an accelerometer, KEH-Gait eliminates the need for powering the sensor, making gait recognition practical for self-powered devices. Our hardware platforms collect voltage data from both PEH and EEH. Evaluation results based on a dataset of 20 subjects show that KEH-Gait, using MSSRC, achieves recognition accuracy comparable to accelerometer-based gait recognition. Furthermore, KEH-Gait improves recognition accuracy by up to 10% compared to several state-of-the-art classification algorithms and reduces energy consumption by 78.15%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to experimentally validate the feasibility of gait recognition using KEH, demonstrating that the output voltage signal of energy harvesters is a promising source for wearable authentication systems.
