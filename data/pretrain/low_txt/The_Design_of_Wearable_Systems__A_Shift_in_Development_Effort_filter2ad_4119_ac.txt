# Defect Analysis in Custom Wearable Systems

## Introduction
This document analyzes the distribution of defects across various phases and attributes in custom wearable systems, specifically focusing on two sets of data: (a) V¯u·Man 2R and Navigator 2, and (b) Spot. The analysis covers several key attributes including defect type, class, trigger, source, and impact.

## Defect Type Distributions
### Electronics, Software, Mechanics, and General Defects
- **Phases**: Design, Bringup, Integration, Operation
- **Findings**:
  - **Electronics**: Defects peak during the Bringup phase for both data sets.
  - **Software**: In the earlier data set, software defects peak in the Bringup phase, but in the Spot data set, they peak in the Integration phase.
  - **Mechanics**: Defects peak in the Operation phase for both data sets, with half of the V¯u·Man 2R and Navigator 2 mechanics defects occurring in this phase, and more than half of the Spot mechanics defects also appearing here.

## Defect Class Distributions
### Omission and Commission Defects
- **Omission**: Something was left out of the design.
- **Commission**: Something in the design is incorrect.
- **Findings**:
  - For V¯u·Man 2R and Navigator 2, the number of Omission and Commission defects is similar.
  - For Spot, the number of Commission defects has more than tripled, resulting in a ratio of 1:3.4 (Omission to Commission).
  - This shift is attributed to increased electronic complexity.
  - Fewer Omission defects were found in the Operation phase for Spot (about 1% of all defects), compared to 12% in the earlier systems. This is linked to the relative newness of wearable systems at the time, where some design aspects were not considered until field deployment.

## Defect Trigger Distributions
### Review and Inspection, Unit Test, System and Field Test
- **Review and Inspection**: Includes formal engineering reviews and visual board inspections.
- **Unit Test**: Directed tests of isolated features.
- **System and Field Test**: Integrated subsystems operating together.
- **Findings**:
  - The trigger distributions are similar across the two data sets.
  - The greatest variation is a 10% increase in Unit Test for Spot.
  - Within each phase, the relative fraction of defects found by a trigger is within 6% between the data sets, except in Bringup, where Unit Test reveals 14% more defects on Spot.

## Defect Source Distributions
### Hardware, Software, and Physical Defects
- **Hardware and Software**: Can be provided by a Vendor, New for the current design, or Reused from an earlier version.
- **Findings**:
  - For V¯u·Man 2R and Navigator 2, New Hardware defects were evenly distributed across the last three phases.
  - For Spot, more than half of New Hardware defects were discovered in the Bringup phase, reflecting the increased electronic complexity.
  - Physical defects peak in the Operation phase for both data sets, at 7% for V¯u·Man 2R and Navigator 2, and 6% for Spot.

## Defect Impact Distributions
### Critical, Performance, Reliability, Lost Objective, Usability, and Minor Defects
- **Critical Defect**: Prevents the system from functioning.
- **Performance and Reliability**: Address efficiency and consistency, respectively.
- **Lost Objective**: Prevents the system from fully satisfying design goals.
- **Usability**: Makes the system difficult to understand or use.
- **Maintainability**: Makes the system hard to service.
- **Minor**: Aesthetic issues that do not affect functionality.
- **Findings**:
  - More than half of all Spot defects were Critical Defects, compared to only 28% in the earlier designs.
  - Of the Critical Defects discovered on Spot, more than half were found in Bringup, and more than 80% were found between Bringup and Integration.
  - The Critical Defect, Lost Objective, and Reliability categories combined account for 74% of all defects in the earlier data and 80% on Spot.
  - The relative ordering within these categories has changed, with Critical Defects becoming 24% more prevalent, Lost Objective defects becoming 22% less frequent, and Reliability defects remaining about the same.

## Conclusions
- Custom wearable systems are becoming more complex due to increasing interoperability requirements.
- This complexity is reflected in attributes such as chip, connector, and pin counts, as well as in the effort spent on debugging new designs.
- An increasing proportion of observed defects are designer errors rather than forgotten features, and these defects are becoming more severe.
- Overall design effort is shifting towards the Bringup phase, where most defects related to newly-designed hardware are surfacing.
- Despite these changes, the methods used to discover defects appear to be holding relatively constant.
