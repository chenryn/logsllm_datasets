This research was supported by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) through an award to the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Institute (CIRI) Center of Excellence (COE), led by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The views and conclusions presented here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policies or endorsements, either expressed or implied, of DHS.

## Why Look for Cyber Threats?

### Aggressive Data Collection
- **Exfiltration of Sensitive User Data to China (Adups)**: Unauthorized data collection and transmission.
- **Sensitive Data Collection (OnePlus 5)**: Invasive data gathering practices.

### Remote System Compromise
- **System Compromise from Insecure Network Communications (Ragentek)**: Vulnerabilities in network protocols leading to system breaches.

### User Data Disclosure Due to Vendor Modifications
- **Samsung Leaking Log Data (CVE-2017-7978)**: Logs containing sensitive information being exposed.
- **MediaTek Leaking Log Data (CVE-2016-10135)**: Similar vulnerabilities in MediaTek chipsets.

### Local “Root” Privilege Escalation
- **Alcatel A30 (Former Amazon Prime Exclusive Device)**
- **Leagoo P1**
- **Privileged EngineerMode App (OnePlus 5)**
- **Android 4.4 Devices with a MediaTek Chipset**: Exploits that allow unauthorized root access.

## Pre-installed Apps and Vendor OS Modification

### Pre-installed Apps
- **Set of Pre-installed Apps**: These apps may not be available on Google Play and some cannot be disabled.
- **Privileged Platform Apps**: These apps have elevated permissions and can be both malicious and insecure.

### Vendor Modifications
- **Custom Behavior**: Vendors often modify Google’s official Android code, which can unintentionally expose sensitive capabilities.

## App Components
- **Fundamental Functional Blocks**:
  - **Activity**
  - **Broadcast Receiver**
  - **Service**
  - **Content Provider**
- **Manifest File**: Declares these components and their accessibility.
- **Intents**: Message-like abstractions for communication between apps, potentially carrying embedded data.

## Exported App Components
- **Accessibility**: Exported components are accessible to any process on the device.
- **Regulation**: Controlled by `android:exported` and `android:permission` attributes.
- **Default Behavior**: Components without the `android:exported` attribute and at least one intent-filter are exported by default.

## DMInstallerService
- **Exported by Default**: This service is accessible by default, posing potential security risks.

## Threat Model
- **Low-Privilege Third-Party App**: Installed via app repackaging, phishing, or remote exploit.
- **Permissions**: May require `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission but does not need other malicious permissions.

## Android Devices on US Carriers - Vulnerabilities

### ZTE Blade Spark (AT&T)
- **Modem and Logcat Logs**: Written to external storage.

### LG Phoenix 2 (AT&T)
- **Logcat Logs**: Written to the app’s private directory.
- **Device Lockout**: Can lock the user out of their device.

### Asus ZenFone V Live (Verizon)
- **Command Execution as System User**
- **Screenshot**: Can take and write screenshots to external storage.

### ZTE Blade Vantage (Verizon)
- **Modem and Logcat Logs**: Written to external storage.

### Essential Phone (Sprint)
- **Programmatic Factory Reset**

### Coolpad Defiant (T-Mobile)
- **Text Messages**: Send, read, and modify.
- **Factory Reset**: Programmatic.
- **Contact Phone Numbers**: Obtain phone numbers of contacts.

### T-Mobile Revvl Plus (Coolpad) (T-Mobile)
- **Text Messages**: Send, read, and modify.
- **Factory Reset**: Programmatic.
- **Contact Phone Numbers**: Obtain phone numbers of contacts.

### ZTE ZMAX Pro (T-Mobile)
- **Text Messages**: Send, read, and modify.
- **Factory Reset**: Programmatic.
- **Contact Phone Numbers**: Obtain phone numbers of contacts.
- **Modem and Logcat Logs**: Written to external storage.

### LG G6 (Multiple Carriers)
- **Device Lockout**: Can lock the user out of their device.
- **Logs**: Get logcat and kernel logs.

### ZTE ZMAX Champ (Total Wireless)
- **Modem and Logcat Logs**: Written to external storage.
- **Factory Reset**: Programmatic.
- **Crash Recovery Mode**: Make the device continually crash in recovery mode.

## ZTE – Modem Log and Logcat Log
- **Vulnerability**: Allows any app to access text messages, call data, and logcat logs.
- **Activation**: Can be activated by any app on the device, transparent to the user.
- **Storage**: Writes to `/sdcard/sd_logs`.
- **Format**: Modem log in qmdl format, logcat log in plaintext.
- **Devices Affected**: ZTE Blade Spark, ZTE Blade Vantage, ZTE ZMAX Pro, ZTE ZMAX Champ.

## Sample Data Leaked Through Logcat
- **Sensitive Information**: Login credentials, tokens, text message content, call logs, GPS coordinates, email addresses, cell tower IDs, MAC addresses, serial numbers, IMEI, IMSI, URLs.

## Exposing User Data Through Logcat Logs
- **Third-Party Apps**: Cannot read system-wide logcat logs since Android 4.1 due to sensitivity.
- **Pre-installed Apps**: Can expose log data to other apps, typically written to external storage.
- **External Storage Access**: Any app with `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission can read from external storage, including user photos, downloads, and arbitrary files.

## Device and Carrier List
- **ZTE Blade Spark (AT&T)**
- **ZTE Blade Vantage (Verizon)**

## ZTE – Activating the Modem Log
- **Text Messages**: Example of outgoing and incoming messages.
- **Call Logs**: Example of incoming and outgoing calls.

## LG Vulnerabilities
- **System-Wide Logcat Log**: Can be obtained in the attacking app’s private directory.
- **Device Lockout**: Can lock the user out of their device, except for emergency calls.
- **Hidden Database Dump**: Can dump logcat and kernel logs to external storage.

## LG – Read System-wide Logcat Log Via Command Line Argument Injection
- **Default Command**: `logcat -v threadtime -s GpsLocationProvider:V LocationManagerService:V GnssLogService:V`

## LG – Lock The User Out of Their Device
- **Screen Lock**: Unresponsive except for emergency calls.
- **Broadcast Receiver**: In `com.android.systemui` app, writes values to system settings and locks the screen.
