### Privacy and Security in Camera-Based Assistive Technologies for the Visually Impaired

#### Research on Privacy Transforms
Researchers such as Li et al. [56] and Hasan et al. [37, 56] have been investigating privacy transforms that are visually appealing to viewers. For assistive applications, further research is needed to understand how the quality of assistance might be affected by obfuscating transforms. Technologies should help determine the appropriate audience for specific types of questions and implement measures to detect privacy violations for that audience. Alternatively, they should select the right audience based on all subject matter in the photo, not just the foreground object. Users should be informed if personally identifiable information (PII) is present while using crowd-sourced technology, and they should be aware if prescription medications are visible when seeking assistance from friends.

#### Security Paradox
Given our focus on camera-based assistive technologies, we believe that technical systems, more broadly, may be creating differential forms of insecurity in the daily lives of people with visual impairments. This leads to a 'security paradox' where, on one hand, these systems are essential for maintaining routines, but on the other, they expose users to additional vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is crucial to continue understanding where systems create insecurity through further exploration of a broad range of assistive technologies. This will also uncover new values that can drive future design.

### Limitations of the Study
We acknowledge several limitations in our study that could be addressed in future work:
- Our participant sample was small and limited to a few national blind foundations, and participants were those who responded to an ad about camera-based assistive technology. This makes it difficult to generalize our findings to the broader population.
- However, compared to other recent studies on privacy concerns for the visually impaired, our sample size is relatively large [7, 14, 75].
- We considered only three types of human assistants, but other social groups, such as co-workers and specific categories of friends (close, distant), may also impact information-sharing behaviors.
- Our qualitative data highlighted a distinction between professional crowd agents and volunteers, which should be explored in future work.
- We focused on the effect of background content and audiences on sharing preferences, but other factors, such as the sharing context and purpose, may also influence preferences.

### Conclusion
To better understand the privacy concerns of people with visual impairments in the context of photo-based, human-assisted question-answering systems, we conducted an online survey with 155 visually impaired individuals. We found that while they have privacy and security concerns about revealing background objects, their information disclosure preferences vary according to the types of objects and human assistants. Some findings were counter-intuitive; for example, participants were more concerned with the privacy of bystanders than their own, and they were more comfortable sharing self-presentation concerns with family (and possibly crowd workers) rather than friends.

We believe that the design of these systems can create a lack of personal security in the lives of the people we aim to assist. Although assistive technologies have great potential for social good, they can also potentially harm people. As designers and builders of sociotechnical systems, we must continue to understand both the positive aspects and the moral and ethical dilemmas that may arise when our systems are used. In doing so, we hope these systems will take on more humanistic and empathetic qualities, achieving our goal of assisting rather than harming others.
