When using the "Find File" feature (Cmd+P) in Atom, I noticed that it does not function if no files have been opened yet. Furthermore, there is no error message to indicate the issue. After spending a few minutes with Atom, I understand why this might be the case. However, my initial impression was that Atom was still too unstable for use when the first action I attempted (aside from Cmd+Shift+P as suggested by the welcome.md file) did not work. Perhaps the "Find File" button should be grayed out until it becomes functional.

I am currently using Atom Version 0.111.0 on OS X.
