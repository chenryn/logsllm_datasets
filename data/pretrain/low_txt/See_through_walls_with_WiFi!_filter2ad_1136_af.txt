### Detection Accuracy and SNR in Different Building Structures

**Detection Accuracy**
- 100%
- 87.5%

**Building Materials**
- Free Space
- Tinted Glass
- 1.75" Solid Wood Door
- 6" Hollow Wall
- 8" Concrete

### Figure 12: Gesture Detection in Different Building Structures
- **(a)** Plots the detection accuracy of Wi-Vi for different types of obstructions.
- **(b)** Shows the average SNR of the experiments conducted through these different materials, with error bars indicating the minimum and maximum achieved SNRs across the trials.

### Experimental Setup
In addition to previous tests, we also evaluated Wi-Vi in a second building on our university campus, which has different wall structures. We experimented with four types of building materials:
- 8" concrete wall
- 6" hollow wall supported by steel frames with sheet rock on top
- 1.75" solid wood door
- Tinted glass

We also performed experiments in free space with no obstructions between Wi-Vi and the subject. In each experiment, the subject stood 3 meters away from the wall (or Wi-Vi itself in the case of no obstruction) and performed the '0' bit gesture. For each type of building material, we conducted 8 experiments.

### Performance Across Different Building Materials
Figure 12 illustrates Wi-Vi’s performance across various building materials. Specifically:
- **Figure 12(a)** shows the detection rate as the fraction of experiments in which Wi-Vi correctly decoded the gesture.
- **Figure 12(b)** shows the average SNRs of the gestures.

The results indicate that Wi-Vi can detect humans and identify their gestures through various indoor building materials, including tinted glass, solid wood doors, 6" hollow walls, and, to a large extent, 8" concrete walls. As expected, the thicker and denser the obstructing material, the more challenging it is for Wi-Vi to capture reflections from behind it.

### Nulling Capability
Detecting humans behind different materials depends on Wi-Vi’s power and its ability to eliminate the flash effect. Figure 13 plots the CDF of the amount of nulling (i.e., reduction in SNRs) that Wi-Vi achieves in various experiments. The plot shows that Wi-Vi reduces the signal from static objects by a median of 40 dB, indicating its effectiveness in eliminating flash reflections off common building materials such as glass, solid wood doors, interior walls, and concrete walls with limited thickness. However, it would not be able to see through denser materials like reinforced concrete.

To improve nulling, one may use a circulator at the analog front end [18] or leverage recent advances in full-duplex radio [14], which have been reported to produce up to 80 dB reduction in interference power [19].

### Concluding Remarks
Wi-Vi is a wireless technology that uses Wi-Fi signals to detect moving humans behind walls and in closed rooms. Unlike previous systems designed for military use, Wi-Vi enables small, inexpensive, see-through-wall devices that operate in the ISM band, making them accessible to the general public. Wi-Vi also establishes a communication channel between itself and a human behind a wall, allowing direct communication without the need for a transmitting device.

We believe that Wi-Vi represents a broader set of functionalities that future wireless networks will provide. Future Wi-Fi networks are likely to expand beyond traditional communications to deliver services such as indoor localization, sensing, and control. Wi-Vi demonstrates an advanced form of Wi-Fi-based sensing and localization by using Wi-Fi to track humans behind walls, even when they do not carry a wireless device. It also raises important issues related to user privacy and regulations concerning the use of Wi-Fi signals.

Finally, Wi-Vi bridges state-of-the-art networking techniques with human-computer interaction. It motivates a new form of user interfaces that rely solely on the reflections of transmitted RF signals to identify human gestures. By leveraging finer nulling techniques and employing better hardware, the system can evolve to see through denser building materials and achieve longer ranges. These improvements will further allow Wi-Vi to capture higher quality images, enabling the gesture-based interface to become more expressive and promising new directions for virtual reality.

### Appendix: Convergence of Iterative Nulling
We prove why iterative nulling proposed in §4 converges. Wi-Vi models the channel estimate errors as additive (in line with common practice of modeling quantization error [25]). Hence, by substituting \(\hat{h_1}\) with \(h_1 + \Delta_1\), and \(\hat{h_2}\) with \(h_2 + \Delta_2\), in Eq. 1, we obtain:

\[ h_{res} = h_1 + h_2 - \left( \frac{h_1 + \Delta_1}{h_2 + \Delta_2} \right) \approx \Delta_2 - \Delta_1 + \frac{\Delta_2^2}{h_2} \]

which follows from the first-order Taylor series approximation since \(\Delta_2 \ll h_2\).

#### Iterating on \(h_1\) alone
We first analyze how the algorithm converges if it were iterating only on Step 1. According to Algorithm 1, \(\hat{h_1}\) is refined to \(h_{res} + \hat{h_1}\). By updating the precoding vector, the new received channel after nulling \(h_{res}'\) is:

\[ h_{res}' = h_{res} + \Delta_2 - \Delta_1 + \frac{\Delta_2^2}{h_2} \]

By applying the first-order Taylor series approximation since \(\Delta_2 \ll h_2\), we get \(|h_{res}'| \ll |h_{res}|\). Therefore, after the i-th iteration, \(h_{res}^{(i)}\) becomes \(h_{res}^{(0)} \left( \frac{\Delta_2}{h_2} \right)^i\).

#### Iterating on \(h_2\) alone
We now analyze how the algorithm converges if it were iterating only on Step 2. According to Algorithm 1, \(\hat{h_2}\) is refined to \(\hat{h_1} - \hat{h_2}\). By updating the precoding vector, the new received channel after nulling is:

\[ h_{res}' = h_1 - \left( \frac{h_2}{1 + \Delta_2 / h_2} \right) \approx h_{res} \left( 1 - \frac{\Delta_2}{h_2} \right) \]

which follows from the first-order Taylor series approximation since \(\Delta_2 \ll h_2\). Hence, \(|h_{res}'| \ll |h_{res}|\), and \(h_{res}^{(i)}\) converges as above.

#### Iterative nulling on \(h_1\) and \(h_2\)
By the above arguments, after \(i\) iterations on \(h_1\) and \(j\) iterations on \(h_2\), the nulled channel becomes:

\[ h_{res}^{(i,j)} = h_{res}^{(0)} \left( \frac{\Delta_2}{h_2} \right)^{i+j} \]

This shows that the iterative nulling process effectively reduces the residual channel, leading to improved nulling performance.
