# Learning about Parsers

Parsers are a vast and complex topic, and I'm currently in the process of finding good resources to help me understand them better. Here are some books I've found so far:

- **[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html)**

    - Teaches you how to build an interpreter from scratch without relying on external tools.
    - Available in multiple formats: EPUB, PDF, and web.
    - Free to read online.
    - Includes charming illustrations.
  - **Cons:**
    - Code snippets are in Java and C, which might not be everyone's preferred language.
    - The book is quite long, which can be daunting for beginners.

- **Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools by Aho, Alfred V., Monica S. Lam, Ravi Sethi, & Jeffrey D. Ullman**
  - **Pros:**

  - **Cons:**
