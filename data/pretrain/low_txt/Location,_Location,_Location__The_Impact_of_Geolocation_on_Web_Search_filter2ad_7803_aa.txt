## Abstract
To manage the vast amount of content available on the web, search engines use sophisticated algorithms to personalize search results for individual users. However, this personalization has raised concerns about the "Filter Bubble" effect, where useful information is deemed irrelevant and thus not shown to the user. This paper introduces a novel methodology to investigate the impact of location-based personalization on Google Search results. We collected 30 days of search results from Google in response to 240 different queries, comparing results from 59 GPS coordinates across the U.S. at three granularities: county, state, and national. Our findings show that differences in search results due to personalization increase with physical distance, but the extent of personalization varies significantly depending on the type of query. Queries for local establishments exhibit substantial personalization, while more general terms show little to no personalization.

## 1. Introduction
Search engines are the primary gateway to information in the developed world, with Google being the most visited site on the internet, receiving over 48,000 queries per second. The importance of content and ordering in search results is highlighted by the European Union's "Right to be Forgotten" ruling and the thriving Search Engine Optimization (SEO) industry.

To handle the vast amount of web content, search engines use complex algorithms to personalize search results. While this can be beneficial, such as showing local coffee shops to users, it also raises concerns about the "Filter Bubble" effect, where the algorithm may prevent users from finding useful information. This is particularly concerning for political and news-related information, as personalization based on political preferences can trap users in an "echo chamber."

Our previous work explored the factors triggering personalization in Google Search, finding that geolocation-based personalization caused more differences in search results than any other single feature. This study aims to further investigate whether location-based personalization impacts all types of queries equally and at what distance these differences become significant. Understanding these dynamics is crucial because geolocation can serve as a proxy for demographic traits like race, income, education, and political affiliation.

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Locations and Search Terms
#### Locations
We focused our study on Ohio, a "battleground" state in U.S. politics, to examine the correlation between demographics and location-based personalization. We selected 66 locations across three granularities:
- **National Level:** Centroids of 22 random states.
- **State Level:** Centroids of 22 random counties within Ohio, averaging 100 miles apart.
- **County Level:** Centroids of 15 voting districts in Cuyahoga County, the most populous county in Ohio, averaging 1 mile apart.

#### Search Terms
We compiled a corpus of 240 queries, categorized into:
- **Local Queries (33):** Physical establishments, restaurants, and public services (e.g., "bank," "hospital," "KFC").
- **Controversial Queries (87):** Topics such as "progressive tax," "end Medicaid," "fluoridate water," "stem cell research," and "man-made global warming hoax."
- **Politicians' Names (120):** Including members of the Cuyahoga County Board, Ohio House and Senate, U.S. Senate and House, and national figures like Joe Biden and Barack Obama.

### 2.2 Data Collection and Analysis
We used the JavaScript Geolocation API to present arbitrary GPS coordinates to the mobile version of Google Search, allowing us to collect search results from any location. Over 30 days, we gathered search results for 240 different queries from 75 GPS coordinates at three granularities.

### 2.3 Key Observations
- **Distance and Personalization:** Differences in search results grow as the physical distance between users increases.
- **Query Type Impact:** Local queries (e.g., "airport") are highly personalized, while queries for politicians' names and controversial topics show minor changes.
- **Maps vs. Normal Results:** Only 20-30% of differences are due to embedded Maps, with the rest attributed to changes in "normal" search results.
- **Noisy Local Results:** Search results for local terms are extremely noisy, with users at the same location and time often receiving different results.

## 3. Analysis and Findings
Our analysis reveals that location-based personalization significantly affects search results, particularly for local queries. The impact of personalization varies by query type, with local queries showing the highest degree of personalization. Surprisingly, even at the same location, search results can vary, indicating a high level of noise in local search results.

## 4. Related Work
Previous studies have explored various aspects of search engine personalization, including the role of user behavior, browsing history, and social networks. Our work builds on these efforts by focusing specifically on the impact of geolocation and providing a detailed methodology for collecting and analyzing location-based search results.

## 5. Conclusion
This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of geolocation on web search personalization. Our findings highlight the significant role of location in shaping search results, especially for local queries. Future work will explore the implications of these findings for information access and the potential for mitigating the Filter Bubble effect.
