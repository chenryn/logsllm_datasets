### Enhancing Label Readability and Utility

Separating privacy and security information on the label would enhance readability and utility, thereby educating consumers more effectively. P1 explained: “I favor the separation option because I believe in a streamlined label that most consumers can easily and quickly understand.” S8 concurred: “Separate sections better enable consumer choice and education, as they may have preferences for one aspect over the other.”

However, half of the experts (11 out of 21) believed that privacy and security factors should be combined into one section. For example, P4 argued that some consumers might prioritize security over privacy, and separating them could lead to a focus on security while neglecting privacy. Among those who preferred combining the information, almost all (9 out of 11) emphasized that privacy and security are so interrelated that complete separation is impractical.

In our presented label, we grouped information into three main sections: security mechanisms, data practices, and general/more information. Participants found this separation logical and intuitive.

### Factors to Include in the IoT Label

From the second survey, we identified 30 factors recommended by at least 4 out of 7 experts for inclusion on the label (either on the primary or secondary layer) and 17 factors recommended for exclusion. Since each expert was shown only a third of the factors (21 in total), a majority required at least 4 responses.

The authors discussed the experts’ arguments and preferences for each factor, making decisions on inclusion and placement. In some cases, we made decisions that contradicted the majority if we felt their concerns could be addressed differently.

#### Primary Layer

We identified 12 factors that at least 4 out of 7 experts wanted to include on the primary layer:
- Privacy rating from an independent privacy assessment organization
- Security rating from an independent security assessment organization
- Date until which security updates will be provided
- Type of data collected
- Types of sensors on the device
- Whether the device uses cryptographic signing
- Types of physical actuations (e.g., talking, blinking) and their activation circumstances
- Whether the device uses any default passwords and critical automatic security updates
- Frequency of data sharing (e.g., continuous, on demand)
- Warranty period of the device
- Level of detail (granularity) of the collected, used, and shared data
- Access control for the device and apps (e.g., none, single-user account, multi-user account)

Experts favored these factors on the primary layer because they are essential for consumers to know, convey critical privacy and security information, and inform purchase decisions. For instance, P1 highlighted the importance of including the type of collected data: “This is the most useful information for consumers to compare privacy risks of IoT devices.”

All consumer participants understood the primary layer information and could discuss its privacy and security implications. C3, for example, linked the expiration date of security updates to planned obsolescence: “It’s useful to know when security updates will no longer be available, as it alerts people to the device's limited lifespan.”

Among the primary layer factors, we decided to move three to the secondary layer or exclude them:
- Physical actuation: Moved to the secondary layer due to its safety rather than privacy and security relevance.
- Frequency of data sharing: Moved to the secondary layer because most people do not fully grasp its privacy and security implications.
- Device warranty period: Excluded as it has minimal privacy, security, or safety implications.

#### Secondary Layer

We identified 13 factors that at least 4 out of 7 experts wanted to include on the secondary layer:
- Data retention time
- Purpose of data collection
- Information that can be inferred from collected data
- Supported standards (e.g., Wi-Fi, Zigbee)
- Location of data storage
- Whether collected data will be linked with data obtained from other sources
- Special data handling practices for children’s data
- User control (e.g., opt-in/opt-out from data sharing)
- Data collection frequency (e.g., once a month, on install)
- Device functionality without internet connectivity
- Relevant security and privacy laws and standards (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR)
- Link to the device’s key management protocol
- Resource usage (e.g., power, data)

Experts cited two main reasons for placing factors on the secondary layer: the need for detailed information to convey risk (6 out of 7) or the lack of critical privacy and security information (4 out of 7).

We moved three secondary layer factors to the primary layer:
- Date of the latest firmware update: Both layers should include the firmware version number and date.
- Purpose of data collection: Grouped into high-level categories for the primary layer.
- Location of data storage: Important for understanding privacy and security implications.

#### Factors with No Specific Layer

Four factors had split opinions between the primary and secondary layers:
- Who the data is shared with
- Who the data is sold to
- Device functionality when data-driven smart features are turned off
- Whether the device has parental control mode

We placed parental controls and device functionality without smart features on the secondary layer. The factors related to data sharing and selling were moved to the primary layer due to consumer concern and their impact on purchase decisions.

#### Factors to Exclude from the Label

Six factors were excluded by at least 6 out of 7 experts:
- List of device-compatible products
- Link to the device’s software and hardware bill of materials
- Link to the device’s accompanying app(s)
- Whether the device manufacturer has a bug bounty program
- Where and when the device brand was incorporated
- Consumer Reports rating

Experts excluded these factors due to their lack of relevance to privacy and security and their inability to convey risk. We included the bug bounty program (reworded as vulnerability disclosure and management) and the software and hardware bill of materials on the secondary layer, based on consumer feedback.

### Attitudes toward Labels and Layered Design

All consumer participants expressed difficulty in finding privacy and security information for smart devices before purchasing. They unanimously desired an IoT security and privacy label at the point of sale to be well-informed.

Most experts agreed that such labels are valuable for informing consumer decisions, aligning with prior research. P7 noted: “A label empowers consumers to make informed cybersecurity decisions, especially as technology becomes more consumer-oriented.”
