### 4. Performance Analysis

In many cases, Markowitz demonstrates superior performance. For certain messages, paths are independent, and Markowitz leverages this path diversity to achieve better results. While Markowitz-Numeric and Markowitz exhibit different performance levels, the differences are generally not significant. To highlight the importance of accounting for correlations, we introduce a modified version of Markowitz (labeled MkwIg) that ignores any correlations between paths. The performance of MkwIg is notably degraded, underscoring the significance of systematically incorporating correlations. Additionally, we observe that the Proportional method performs worse in all scenarios.

In summary, the benefits of erasure coding are limited due to dependencies among paths. In many instances, simple replication may be sufficient, and the complexity of erasure coding-based techniques may not be justified. However, if very high assurance is required, erasure coding can significantly increase the "nines" of delivery success (e.g., from a success probability of 0.9 to 0.99).

### 5. Sensor Network Scenario

In this section, we briefly discuss early results obtained by applying our ideas to address the reliable communication problem in a multi-hop dense sensor network scenario. This scenario differs from the previous two cases as it involves partial failures. We consider a loss model where packet loss occurs due to poor channel quality, which can be caused by obstacles, interference, hidden terminal problems, and multipath effects. Each link is characterized by a success probability, which is the probability that a transmitted packet is successfully received. If multiple code-blocks are sent over a contact opportunity, the resultant behavior can be approximated by a binomial distribution [24]. This is different from the previous scenarios where \( S_i \) were Bernoulli. We also assume that sensors periodically sleep with a low duty cycle to save energy [19], causing frequent disconnections and representing an instance of a Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN) where immediate feedback may not be possible.

#### Simulation Setup and Parameters

Our simulation topology is based on a real 97-node deployment of a sensor network in an office lab environment [15]. The sensor nodes are placed in a 40x16 foot grid with a grid size of 8 feet. We use prior results to characterize packet loss based on distance [24]. The basic routing algorithm used was a minimum-cost algorithm, with edge costs defined based on the distance between the endpoints of edges. The algorithm was extended to find the k best edge-disjoint paths. On average, there were 7 paths from a node to the base station, with path loss rates ranging from 0.4 to 0.6, consistent with ongoing studies [15]. The parameter \( r \) was set to 2.

#### Results

The mean failure rates for different techniques and their percentiles (5th, 50th, and 95th) are shown in Figure 6. As expected, SRep has significantly higher failure rates (95%). This is natural because we only receive fragments of a message over the two paths, and without erasure coding, at least one copy of each fragment is needed to reconstruct the message. SRep-Code, which uses a greedy allocation technique by sending code blocks on the best \( r \) paths, shows significantly better performance with a failure rate of only 2.88%. The Markowitz approach provides additional benefits, particularly in terms of higher percentiles. For example, the 80th percentile failure probability for Markowitz was less than 2%, while it was more than 6% for SRep-Code.

### 6. Summary of Results

The three scenarios are interesting because they cover a range of network scales and path failure models. The MULE scenario considers single-hop, uncorrelated delivery paths without volume constraints. The SFO city bus scenario uses multi-hop, correlated paths with volume constraints. Finally, the sensor network scenario has a large number of disjoint routing paths, allowing us to explore partial path failures.

A consistent theme throughout our results is the existence of three operating regimes (based on the product \( p \cdot r \)) that profoundly affect the best choice. Figure 7 classifies the efficacy of different techniques in these regimes.

- **Regime 1 (Low \( p \cdot r \))**: Erasure coding does not provide additional benefits over simple replication, regardless of the number of available paths.
- **Regime 2 (Intermediate \( p \cdot r \))**: The benefits of erasure coding are only evident when there are many paths on which to split code blocks.
- **Regime 3 (High \( p \cdot r \))**: All techniques achieve high success probabilities, but erasure coding-based techniques can approach a near-perfect success rate.

An encouraging result is that our Markowitz technique handles all three regimes and performs close to optimal in most cases. Using the Sharpe-Ratio as an alternative objective function proved efficient and effective in capturing complex aspects such as path dependencies. While simple heuristics like the proportional approach may perform well in certain situations, they often have notably worse performance in others. For partial path failures and forced splitting due to limited contact volume, erasure coding is a clear win.

### 7. Related Work

The use of replication to improve reliability in DTNs has been suggested in recent work [8, 9]. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically examine how replication and erasure coding can combat uncertainties, lack of information, and failures in DTN scenarios.

#### Portfolio Theory

Modern portfolio theory has a vast literature, and an extensive survey is not possible here. The theory of efficient frontiers and utility maximization was developed by Henry Markowitz in the late 1950s. The concept of the Sharpe-Ratio was proposed by William Sharpe in the context of stock-market equilibrium and optimal investment. Markowitz and Sharpe (along with Merton Miller) won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1990 for this work.

To our knowledge, numerical search is the only method for maximizing the Sharpe-Ratio with volume constraints. Unconstrained optimization is covered in detail in several sources [1, 13, 6]. The existence of a unique maximum on the efficient frontier and the various approaches for finding it using numerical methods are also covered in prior work [13, 20].

Optimizing the utility function \( P(Y > c) \) for general distributions is not well studied due to the complex nature of the distribution of \( Y \). Most literature focuses on concave utility functions expressed in terms of the mean and variance of the return \( Y \) [1, 6]. Some approaches discuss the minimization of the shortfall probability \( P(Y < c) \) in the context of reliability of \( k \)-out-of-\( n \) systems [11], where systems fail if more than \( k \) components fail. The focus is on computing \( P(Y > c) \) for a given configuration, not on optimizing it. We believe this problem presents an interesting avenue for future work.

### 8. Conclusions and Future Directions

In this paper, we investigate improving the probability of successful message delivery in DTNs with path failures by combining erasure coding and replication. Although erasure coding is a well-known technique for addressing failures in traditional networks, the notions of path failures and volume constraints in DTNs significantly alter the best solution approaches. By formulating the optimal allocation problem of erasure code blocks over multiple paths, we found that even for the simple case of Bernoulli failures, solving this problem is challenging. We used a mixed integer program, which, while computationally complex, serves as a benchmark for evaluating other methods.

Our primary solution technique relies on modern portfolio theory, allowing us to optimally solve the problem for a Gaussian failure model and providing good approximations for other cases. Despite a complex derivation, the final algorithm is simple and elegant, accounting for path dependencies and volume constraints. Through simulations of various DTN scenarios, we demonstrate that this approach offers significant benefits over simple heuristics like greedy and proportional allocation and works well in most scenarios. Interestingly, similar problems arise in replica placement in wide-area storage systems and virtual node mapping in distributed hash tables (DHTs). The ideas presented here should provide useful insights for these problems as well.

This paper is a first step in understanding reliability issues in DTNs. Our formulation assumes that underlying probabilities remain constant over time. Violations of this assumption present additional challenges, and some form of adaptation might be required to handle dynamic conditions.

In investigating the combinatorial version (Bernoulli case) of our problem, we were unable to compute optimal solutions at a large scale. Efficient approximation algorithms (e.g., using Chernoff bounds) present an encouraging avenue of exploration for this and related problems. Another interesting direction would be to optimize the replication factor given constraints on delivery probabilities. The analysis included here provides hints along these lines, but this direction is still open.

Finally, we have some experience with the impact of erasure coding on the delay distribution of message delivery in opportunistic DTN networks, which we discuss separately in [22]. This is another potentially rich direction for future work.
