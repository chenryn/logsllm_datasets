### 4.1 Performance Degradation Analysis

Nikravesh et al. [5] demonstrated that network performance follows a daily pattern. To determine if the event caused a performance degradation, we compared the results from devices at the venue with those not at the venue (Fig. 6b) and those connected to WiFi (Fig. 6c). The average load time and the number of failures for these groups were relatively stable. Surprisingly, the number of successful requests decreased, which we attribute to users stopping the app after recognizing it was running, even when they were not at the venue.

Before the performance at the venue declined, the WiFi measurements already showed a significantly lower average load time, supporting the findings of existing studies [7]. The failure rate at the venue reached a peak of nearly 40%, while the WiFi measurements maintained a consistently low failure rate. The reasons for the increased failure rate among devices not at the venue require further investigation. The total number of requests increased after midnight due to the "continue tomorrow" feature, which is not reflected in Fig. 6a because people left the venue earlier on Thursday.

In conclusion, the comparison of performance between participants at the venue and those not at the venue confirms that the event caused significant performance degradation.

### 4.2 Carrier Analysis

Figure 7 illustrates the performance of different carriers on Thursday. All carriers experienced a decrease in performance during the event. However, the load time distribution varied among carriers (Fig. 7c). Although Carrier 3 had the lowest load times for the first 50% of all requests, it had a worse tail distribution than Carrier 1. Carrier 2 performed significantly worse. The failure rates provided a different perspective (Fig. 7d). Carrier 1 nearly always had the highest failure rate, while Carrier 4 almost always had the lowest. Thus, the carrier with the lowest failure rate (Carrier 4) had the second-worst load time, and the carrier with the worst failure rate (Carrier 1) had one of the best load times.

### 4.3 Network Type

Figure 8 shows the load times depending on the network type. As expected, the network type had a substantial impact on performance. LTE requests had the lowest average load time and reported nearly no failed requests. Between 20:00 and 22:30, the proportion of participants using EDGE increased (Fig. 9a), while LTE usage decreased. This suggests that the overall performance degradation may be partly due to a lower proportion of LTE connections.

We hypothesized that an overloaded network would cause frequent network type changes. However, Fig. 9b indicates that the network type did not change more often during the event. The distribution of actual transitions between network types (Fig. 10a) shows that most transitions occurred between HSPA and HSPA+. Given the poor performance of EDGE and UMTS, transitions to these types imply a sudden performance degradation for users. A preliminary analysis of signal strength (Fig. 10b) did not reveal any correlation with performance. Further detailed investigation is needed.

### 4.4 Web Page Analysis

The performance of most web pages, as shown in Fig. 11a, followed the general pattern of Fig. 6a, supporting the assumption that the first network hops of client devices were overloaded. However, the page load time for the venue's page showed a sudden increase between midnight and 2 AM (Fig. 11b). We attribute this to the high load introduced by our measurements and the large number of users at midnight.

### 5 Additional Measurements

#### 5.1 Active Measurement: DNS Lookup

In addition to HTTP measurements, we tested DNS performance during the event by executing 167,412 DNS lookups on smartphones. We used both popular domains and randomly generated domains to investigate the impact of caching (mainly in the Android system). Randomly generated domains often resolved to navigation help pages of the carriers (e.g., 62.157.140.133 and 80.156.86.78). Figure 12a shows a CDF of all executed DNS requests, categorized by domain (existing, non-existing) and result (successful, unsuccessful). Successful requests for non-existing domains (navigation help resolutions) took at least 20 ms. Thus, 5% of the unsuccessful requests for non-existing domains failed due to network issues. For existing domains, even cached results took up to 20 ms. More than 50% of all failed requests for existing domains failed within the first 20 ms. The tail of the failed requests for non-existing domains was the longest of all four. Figure 12b shows that DNS performance during the event followed the same pattern as the HTTP requests. To investigate the impact of location on performance, Fig. 13 shows the load time depending on location and time. Despite variations between locations, performance suffered across the area at 21:00.

#### 5.2 Active Measurement: Traceroute

To correlate network performance with network paths, we executed 2,202 traceroutes to multiple domains. Figure 14a shows how the path length differed between carriers. In our measurements, the longest path observed was 23 hops (Carrier 1), occurring once. Future work will aim to replicate results from other traceroute studies, such as Brownlee [2] and Luckie et al. [4].

#### 5.3 Passive Measurement: Traffic Stats

In addition to active measurements, we passively collected traffic statistics provided by Android (Fig. 14). Except for mobile received bytes, the metrics did not significantly change during the event. It is unclear why the metric for mobile received bytes suddenly increased at midnight. Generally, users downloaded four times more data than they uploaded, which aligns with the average packet size, as transferred packets were not fully utilized. Although these statistics include the induced traffic from our measurements, they do not correspond with recent findings from other studies. Erman et al. [3], for example, found that people uploaded as much data as they downloaded during the Super Bowl event.

### 6 Related Work

Previous research on large-scale events has focused on single carriers or passive measurements of users in the network infrastructure. Erman et al. [3] analyzed the Super Bowl from AT&T's perspective, providing a detailed analysis of performance and user behavior. Shaﬁq et al. [6] described provider observations of two crowded events, presenting lower-layer metrics but offering limited insights into the actual performance available at the end device. They were also restricted to the perspective of a few network operators.

Crowdsourcing approaches leverage user support for measurements, providing access to end-device details and not being limited to specific network operators. Nikravesh et al. [5], for example, evaluated a long-term crowdsourcing measurement, offering valuable insights into general network performance. Xu et al. [8] used crowdsourcing to investigate a cellular network in Singapore.

Our work is the first to combine the benefits of extensive crowdsourcing with active measurements of a crowded event.

### 7 Discussion and Future Work

**App-Based Crowdsourcing:** Our study demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale crowdsourcing measurements. We convinced over 1,000 users to participate, and many appreciated the opportunity to help us understand their performance issues. A small fraction of participants complained about increased data transmission and higher energy consumption due to the app. Our setup does not allow us to distinguish between the induced energy consumption of the app and potentially increased consumption due to the overloaded network. Future crowdsourcing studies should explicitly consider this.

**Measurement Results:** The analysis of movement patterns showed that users moved even during crowded times. The Bluetooth beacon-based location service allowed us to track users who did not provide GPS locations. We found significant performance degradation during the festival regarding DNS and HTTP failures, as well as increased load times. The performance degradation varied between network operators, network types, and locations. Carriers with a low failure rate during the event had a higher average load time. We are currently investigating the underlying causes for these differences.

**Future Work:** The large dataset allows for detailed movement models for large-scale events, analysis of dependencies between signal strength and user density, and evaluation of new technologies to handle crowded events. By making the data available to the community, we hope to encourage similar analyses.
