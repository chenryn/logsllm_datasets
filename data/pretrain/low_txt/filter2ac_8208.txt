**Title: Botconf 2019: Zen - A Sophisticated Campaign of Malicious Android Apps**

Android malware authors continuously develop increasingly clever methods to monetize their applications. During my presentation, I highlighted the work of an author or group that demonstrated a wide range of techniques, from simply repackaging legitimate apps with a custom advertising SDK to creating a highly sophisticated rooting trojan with novel methods not seen in other malicious apps. Their most complex creation is named "Zen."

Zen employs a bundle of exploits to gain privileged root access on infected devices. Once it has obtained this elevated access, Zen creates fake Google accounts on the device. This process involves abusing the accessibility service and injecting additional code to facilitate the account creation.
