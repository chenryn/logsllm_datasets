### Unnecessary Detour in Relationships

Relationships between Autonomous Systems (ASes) are complex, and transit or peering relationships may be preferred over one another. Models with finer granularity for ranking AS neighbors could help resolve these issues [27].

### Routing Violations at a US University

Another violation was observed at a US university (U). Initially, the university routed traffic through Internet2 (AS11537) to reach a PEERING location in the US. After we poisoned Internet2, U rerouted through AMPATH (AS20080) to the PEERING location in Brazil. This is considered a violation because CAIDA identifies Internet2 as a provider and AMPATH as a settlement-free peer of U.

### European Network Violation

A similar violation occurred with a European network. Initially, the network routed through Switch (AS559, identified as a provider) and then through NCSA (AS10764, identified as a settlement-free peer) to reach PEERING after we poisoned Switch. These violations suggest that identifying links used as backups might improve our routing models.

### Reverse Engineering BGP Decisions

In our second control plane experiment, we used anycast to explore considerations such as route age on routing decisions. Table 2 shows the root causes behind BGP routing decisions. While most decisions are based on relationship and path length, more than 17% are influenced by intradomain tie-breakers and route age, which are not considered in current models and could be improved.

### Limitations of BGP Poisoning

BGP poisoning does not work when BGP loop prevention is disabled or when ASes filter poisoned announcements [20, 22]. Intermediate ASes between PEERING locations and target ASes may prevent us from controlling routes exported to the target AS. These factors limit our ability to identify all available routes and neighbors of target ASes. Our results cover a small fraction of the Internet and are likely biased toward academic and research networks. However, our control plane techniques are general and can be used by other networks to cover different portions of the Internet. Better coverage and visibility would likely reveal more violations. To this end, we are extending the PEERING platform, and RIPE has configured periodic measurements from a diverse set of probes toward all PEERING prefixes.

### Skewness by Source and Destination ASes

We investigated which source and destination ASes account for most of the routing decisions deviating from our model. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the cumulative fraction of routing decisions violating either the Best or Short condition. If violations were evenly distributed, the curves would follow y = x; otherwise, some ASes are responsible for a disproportionately larger (or smaller) fraction of violations. This effect is present in both plots but more prominently for destination ASes.

#### Akamai and Netflix

Destination ASes owned by Akamai account for 21% of violations, with Cogent (AS174) being the most common source, responsible for 3.4% of these Akamai-related violations. These Cogent-Akamai violations often occur when Cogent prefers a peer-to-peer path through a Tier-1 AS over a longer customer route towards Akamai. Netflix’s AS is the destination on 17% of paths with violations, with nearly a quarter (24%) due to a stale inter-AS link in CAIDA’s topology, which included a direct link between AS3549 and Netflix that no longer exists according to RIPE ASN Neighbor History [32].

#### Source ASes

For source ASes, the distribution is less skewed. Cogent and Time Warner are the top two sources, responsible for 4.1% and 2.2% of violations, respectively.

### Impact of Geography on Routing Decisions

We next considered the role of geography on routing decisions. First, we isolated traceroutes that stay within a continent (Continental traceroutes), where all hops remain inside a given continent based on geolocating router IP addresses. Figure 3 shows the breakdown of decisions in continental traceroutes (45% of our dataset). The fraction of decisions explained by GR for continental traceroutes is significantly greater than for intercontinental ones.

#### Domestic Paths

Next, we focused on traceroutes where the entire traceroute stayed within a single country, but there was a better multinational Best/Short path (in the CAIDA data). We defined a multinational path as one with at least one AS registered (via whois data) in a country outside the source and destination AS’s country. More than 40% of non-Best/Short decisions can be explained by avoiding alternative multinational paths. Table 3 details the non-Best/Short decisions explained by ASes preferring domestic routes.

#### Undersea Cables

Undersea cable ASes are a critical component of Internet topologies that previous works overlook [15, 25]. Some cables are jointly owned by large ISPs, while others, like EAC-C2C (PACNET), are operated by independent organizations using their own allocated ASNs and IP prefixes. These cable operators provide point-to-point transit along the cables and do not originate traffic, resembling high-latency, high-cost IXPs and confusing existing AS relationship models. We need techniques to identify cable ASes and correct their relationships in inferred topologies. We used a list of undersea cables from the TeleGeography Submarine Cable Map [38] to identify ASes for undersea cable operators. Overall, cable-ASes appear on less than 2% of paths but cause deviations from Best/Short paths in 51.2% of decisions involving them. Table 4 shows the fraction of each type of decision explained by undersea cable ASes.

### Conclusion

In this work, we investigated how interdomain paths predicted by state-of-the-art routing models differ from empirically observed routes. While a majority of paths in our dataset agree with models, more than a third do not. We explained a significant fraction of these differences due to factors such as sibling ASes, selective prefix announcements, and undersea cables. Further, we investigated how the models hold up when compared with ground-truth routing preferences revealed using PEERING announcements and identified AS behavior not included in existing models. As part of future work, we aim to incorporate our findings into new models of Internet routing.
