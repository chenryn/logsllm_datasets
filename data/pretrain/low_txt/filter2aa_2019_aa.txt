## Introduction
The Chip & PIN system, designed to enhance the security of credit and debit card transactions, is fundamentally flawed. This document explores the vulnerabilities in the EMV (Europay, MasterCard, and VISA) standard and the practicality of skimming, cloning, and PIN harvesting in a world where chip-based cards are increasingly prevalent.

### What is EMV?
EMV stands for Europay, MasterCard, and VISA, and it is the global standard for inter-operation of integrated circuit cards (IC cards or "chip cards") and IC card-capable point of sale (POS) terminals and automated teller machines (ATMs). The primary purpose of EMV is to authenticate credit and debit card transactions, providing improved security over traditional magnetic stripe technology. EMV systems support offline card verification and transaction approval, and they can host multiple applications on a single card.

### Why EMV?
- **Improved Security:** IC cards offer better security compared to magnetic stripe technology.
- **Offline Verification:** Cards can be verified and transactions approved without needing to go online.
- **Multiple Applications:** A single card can support various applications.

### Liability Shift
- **Merchant to Bank:** In most cases, liability shifts from the merchant to the bank. However, if the merchant does not implement EMV, the liability shifts back to the merchant.
- **Cardholder Liability:** The cardholder is generally assumed to be liable unless they can unequivocally prove that they were not present, did not authorize the transaction, and did not inadvertently disclose their PIN.
- **PIN Verification:** With EMV, PIN verification increasingly serves as "proof" of the cardholder's presence.

#### Example: VISA Zero Liability
- **Fine Print (US):** The zero liability policy does not apply to ATM transactions, PIN transactions not processed by Visa, or certain commercial card transactions. Provisional credit may be withheld, delayed, limited, or rescinded based on factors such as gross negligence or fraud, delay in reporting unauthorized use, investigation and verification of claims, and account standing and history. Immediate notification to the financial institution is required, and the transaction must be posted to the account before provisional credit can be issued.

#### Case Study: CIBC
- **CIBC Spokesman Rob McLeod:** In a $81,276 fraud case, McLeod stated, "Our records show that this was a chip-and-PIN transaction. This means [the customer's] personal card and personal PIN number were used in carrying out this transaction. As a result, [the customer] is liable for the transaction."

### EMV Adoption
- **Progress:** As of March 2011, magnetic stripe fallback is still widely accepted, despite plans to phase it out.

### EMV is Broken
- **Research Findings:** A group of researchers from the University of Cambridge, including S. J. Murdoch, S. Drimer, R. Anderson, and M. Bond, demonstrated that stolen cards can be used successfully without knowing the PIN.
- **Industry Response:** The industry acknowledges the theoretical possibility but claims that the practical implementation of such attacks is difficult. At least one bank has implemented detection and blocking procedures.

### Skimming, Cloning, and PIN Harvesting
- **Skimmer:** A hidden electronic device that intercepts communication between the card and the terminal, collecting available data.
- **Focus:** This analysis focuses on the practicality of skimming, cloning, and PIN harvesting on POS terminals, specifically targeting the chip interface rather than the magnetic stripe.

### ATM Skimmers
- **Rising Threat:** Skimming the chip will become an increasingly attractive target for fraudsters.
- **Accessibility:** The chip interface is inherently accessible, making it difficult for users to verify if the terminal has been tampered with.
- **Undetectability:** An EMV skimmer can remain undetected for a long time and requires minimal installation effort.

### EMV Skimmer Installation
- **Trivial Installation:** By using a special card to "hook" into the system.
- **Power Source:** Powered by the POS terminal itself.
- **Data Retrieval:** Data can be downloaded using a special card recognized by the skimmer.
- **Cost-Effective:** Requires little development effort and is relatively inexpensive.

### EMV Smartcards
- **File System:** Information is stored in a file system organized into applications, files, and records.
- **Communication:** The terminal communicates with the card via APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit) messages for reading records and issuing commands.

### Terminal-ICC Exchange
1. **Initiate Application Processing**
2. **Read Application Data**
3. **Offline Data Authentication (if indicated in the AIP)**
4. **Cardholder Verification (if indicated in the AIP)**
5. **Issuer Script Processing**

### Read Application Data
- **BER-TLV Templates:** Data is stored and read using BER-TLV (Basic Encoding Rules - Tag Length Value) templates.
- **Examples:**
  - 4F: Application Identifier (VISA)
  - 5F2D: Language Preference (itenfrde)
  - 9F1F: Track 1 Discretionary Data
  - 57: Track 2 Equivalent Data
  - 5F25: Application Effective Date
  - 5F24: Application Expiration Date
  - 5A: Application PAN (credit card number)
  - 8E: Cardholder Verification Method (CVM) List
  - 5F20: Cardholder Name
  - 9F36: Application Transaction Counter (ATC)
  - 9F17: PIN Try Counter

### EMV Application Data - Magstripe Clone
- **CVV Matching:** The CVV (228) matches the magstripe only for cards that do not use iCVV (introduced in January 2008).
- **Fallback Mechanism:** Inserting a card without a readable chip triggers magstripe fallback on all tested terminals.
- **iCVV Protection:** EMV skimmers cannot clone successfully to magstripe if iCVV is used.
- **Security Concerns:** The possibility of massive data harvesting, protected by a 3-digit code, is a significant security risk.

### EMV Application Data - Online Usage
- **Card Not Present Transactions:** Application data can be used for online, phone, and other transactions where the security code is not checked and 3-D Secure (Verified by Visa, MasterCard SecureCode) is not employed.
- **Website Vulnerabilities:** Many websites do not check the security code, making them vulnerable to fraud. One of the authors experienced fraud while writing this presentation.

### Offline Data Authentication
- **Methods:** Three methods are available: Static Data Authentication (SDA), Dynamic Data Authentication (DDA), and Combined Data Authentication (CDA).
- **Validation:** Used by the terminal to validate the authenticity of the card, enabling offline transactions where supported.
- **ATM Usage:** ATMs always perform online authentication.
- **Mandates:** Visa and MasterCard mandate DDA for all cards issued after 2011.

### Static Data Authentication (SDA) Cards
- **Cost-Effective:** The cheapest and most widely used technology.
- **Signature:** Selected records are signed with a static signature.
- **Symmetric Key:** Used for online transactions.
- **PIN Verification:** Always in cleartext.
- **Tags:**
  - 8F: Certificate Authority Public Key Index (PKI)
  - 90: Issuer PK Certificate
  - 9F32: Issuer PK Exponent
  - 92: Issuer PK Remainder
  - 93: Signed Static Application Data

### Dynamic Data Authentication (DDA) Cards
- **Cost:** More expensive and less common.
- **Validation:** Static and dynamic data validation, with the terminal asking the card to sign data and a random number with the ICC PK.
- **PAN Embedding:** The ICC PK embeds the PAN, limiting private key usage to the specific card.
- **PIN Verification:** Can be in cleartext or enciphered.
- **Tags:**
  - 8F: Certificate Authority Public Key Index (PKI)
  - 90: Issuer PK Certificate
  - 9F46: ICC PK Certificate
  - 9F32: Issuer PK Exponent
  - 9F47: ICC PK Exponent
  - 92: Issuer PK Remainder
  - 9F48: ICC PK Remainder
  - 9F49: Dynamic Data Authentication Data Object List (DDOL)

### Chip Cloning
- **SDA Cards:** Can be cloned and used without a PIN for offline transactions only.
- **DDA Cards:** Cloning is ineffective for both offline and online transactions, but a valid DDA card can pass offline authentication and perform fake offline transactions.
- **Usage:** Offline transactions are rare in the EU.
