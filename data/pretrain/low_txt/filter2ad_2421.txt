## Abstract

A comprehensive theory of trust in networks involving both humans and computers must integrate a behavioral theory of trust with a computational theory of trust. This integration is driven by the increasing participation of people in online activities, such as social networking, crowdsourcing, and socio-economic protocols. Examples of these protocols include trust and gift-exchange games, norms-establishing contracts, and scenarios involving scams and deception.

We present a class of interactive social protocols that rely on both the trustworthy properties of commodity systems (e.g., verifiable end-to-end trusted paths) and the trust of participants. Online verification of protocol compliance is often impractical, leading to undecidable problems, co-NP complete test procedures, and user inconvenience. Trust in these protocols is characterized by participant preferences (i.e., risk and betrayal aversion) and beliefs in the trustworthiness of other participants. Both preferences and beliefs can be enhanced when non-compliance results in the punishment of untrustworthy participants. Properly defined punishment can reduce betrayal aversion and increase belief in trustworthiness. Similarly, feasible recovery from non-compliance can decrease risk aversion and enhance trustworthiness.

A general theory of trust that focuses on establishing new trust relationships where none previously existed could create new economic opportunities. New trust relationships would expand the pool of available services to users, remove barriers to cooperation, and enable the "network effect" at the application level. Therefore, it is crucial that security research should facilitate and promote trust-enhancement infrastructures in human and computer networks, such as trust networks. Finally, we argue that a general theory of trust should reflect human expectations and mental models without relying on false metaphors or analogies with the physical world.
