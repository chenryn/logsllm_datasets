### Impact of Censorship on Video Sharing and Pornographic Content

#### YouTube and Other Video Sharing Sites
The majority of local content is now served through embedded links from unblocked video providers. The percentage of embedded YouTube links dropped significantly, from an average of 83% to 73% on the day of the block (September 18, 2012), and further to about 51% eleven months later (August 2, 2013). During this period, DailyMotion captured approximately 32% of the embedded links, while Tune.pk increased its share from virtually zero to nearly 11%.

This decline in embedded YouTube links also led to adjustments in search engine page rankings for localized searches. For instance, a manual search (country-specific via google.com.pk) for the top five local television shows revealed that the top results pointed to Tune.pk and DailyMotion. In contrast, a search for non-local content (top five television shows in the USA) returned results primarily referencing YouTube.

In summary, the censored video content provider experiences a loss in traffic and revenue to competing, non-censored sites in several ways: direct reduction in traffic, local content providers moving their hosted channels to alternative platforms, decreased embedded references on third-party pages, and lower page ranks for localized searches. Additionally, the provider may incur higher costs due to the need to serve content through distribution channels used by circumventers. For non-censored providers, these factors may incentivize long-term control over local content. For example, DailyMotion has recently partnered with the largest ISP in the country [15].

#### Pornographic Content
For each trace, we ranked pornographic sites based on the traffic they served into the country, using the methodology described in Section 5. Table 10 shows the top-five coded porn domains for each trace. Before the blocking, globally popular domains [2] dominated the list. After the blocking event, new players emerged and took the top spots. In most cases, these new players were not present in previous traces (indicated in bold in the table), and their relative distribution across post-block traces varied inconsistently. A few domains, such as X, S, and R, appeared in the top-five for more than one trace. We speculate that users are familiar with a few favorite porn websites but, after blocking, discover alternatives through search engines, leading to the variety in top-ranked sites. This aligns with the finding in Section 6 that, after encountering a block page, porn users tend to perform content-specific search queries.

Similar to non-porn video sharing sites, censoring a porn site impairs its revenue share within the censored region. Table 11 analyzes the bandwidth distribution among blocked and unblocked porn websites, showing that the majority of the bandwidth is captured by unblocked porn domains. An exception is ¯A, which appeared in a subsequent trace despite being blocked on December 21, 2011, likely due to circumvention via non-local resolvers. The popularity of new porn domains can also be attributed to the lack of aggressive strategies by censors to block new, popular porn content following the initial introduction of the porn blacklist on December 21, 2011.

### Impact on Service Providers
In this section, we evaluate the consequences of censorship events on ISPs, focusing on their web caching behavior, particularly for video content from the four major providers. Our pre-block traces indicate that videos constituted approximately 95% of the content served by the ISP’s cache servers [14].

Table 12 lists the top-five ASNs serving video content for each trace. Prior to the YouTube block, the top ASN was the local ISP, whose caching servers provided an average of 76% of the video content. On the day of the block, the ISP’s caching servers still served a small fraction of YouTube content, indicating incomplete censorship implementation. Some users could potentially access YouTube content through local DNS caches or alternate DNS resolvers.

Eleven months later, the local ISP was no longer a significant player, replaced by CDNs serving DailyMotion and Tune.pk videos. By August 2, 2013, the ISP’s cache servers were completely absent, and the ISP confirmed that the systems no longer provided any utility. Discussions with ISP operators revealed two reasons for this:
1. Google had provided free caching servers tailored specifically for YouTube. Other video content providers did not offer such solutions, making it difficult for local ISPs to justify the cost of deploying and maintaining custom solutions.
2. The significant decrease in unencrypted video content (Table 7) made it hard to justify the benefits of caching, as ISPs generally cannot cache encrypted content. As a result, ISPs turned to leasing more upstream bandwidth rather than buying and maintaining caching servers.

Consequently, all video content is now primarily fetched from the servers of their respective providers. The operators we acquired traces from had to purchase additional Internet bandwidth after the block.

### Conclusions and Future Work
We have studied the impact of Internet censorship on major stakeholders (service providers, content providers, and end users) in the context of two major censorship events in Pakistan: the block of porn content in 2011 and the block of YouTube in 2012. To this end, we analyzed home and SOHO traffic before, during, and after the censorship events, from the vantage point of a mid-size ISP in a large metropolitan area. Our analysis was based on methodologies developed to identify censorship activity within our packet traces with high confidence.

We observed that blocking porn content caused increases in encrypted traffic (Table 7) but primarily led users to turn to alternative sites (Table 10). In contrast, the YouTube block caused a major shift towards increased encrypted traffic, indicating that users resorted to circumvention mechanisms to continue their access. This shift was well underway on the day the government imposed censorship, suggesting that some users can rapidly adapt to new blocking mechanisms.

Censorship of YouTube also affected the financial landscape of video content providers (Table 8). New players emerged and completely took over the video-sharing market previously dominated by YouTube. This shift also had consequences for ISPs, which previously served video content primarily from YouTube caches (freely provided by Google) hosted within their own networks. Post-YouTube blocking, ISPs must fetch video content through their upstream transit provider, reflecting an increase in bandwidth costs. After the YouTube block was implemented at the local-ISP level (using DNS spoofing), we observed a shift away from the use of the local ISP’s DNS resolvers, dropping from more than 90% pre-blocking to about 70% post-blocking. This shift somewhat erodes a nation’s overall control over its Internet traffic as users transfer their base of trust (i.e., DNS resolution) to parties outside the country.

Future work will involve analyzing additional data from a different ISP in another large city in Pakistan to assess trends across cities and providers. Given the expectation that porn blocking will continue but YouTube censorship will soon end [16], it will be instructive to study whether the proportion of encrypted traffic returns to pre-censorship levels, whether users continue to outsource their DNS resolution, and the degree to which video traffic distribution between YouTube and alternate video sharing sites readjusts.
