### 5.8 Process Calibration and Multiple-Parameter Side-Channel Analysis

When a circuit is affected by a Trojan, various parameters can be used to calibrate the process noise. For instance, dynamic current (IDDT), quiescent or leakage current (IDDQ), and maximum operating frequency (Fmax) may be influenced. These parameters can serve as side-channel references for califying process noise. Researchers in [23] have demonstrated the effects of Trojans and process variations on these three variables (IDDT, IDDQ, and Fmax). MERS can increase IDDT, which significantly improves the accuracy of [23] in isolating a Trojan-infected chip from process-induced variations in a multiple-parameter space.

### 5.9 Scalability to Large Designs

MERS can be combined with existing process calibration approaches [21][22][23] to minimize false positives/negatives and maximize Trojan coverage. Most side-channel analysis methods perform process variation calibration using golden chips at different process corners. This helps in distinguishing between process variations and Trojan-induced changes.

For large designs, the supply current of a golden chip under high-activity vectors can be very large compared to the additional current consumed by a small Trojan. The variation in current due to process noise can also be significant, potentially masking the Trojan's effect on the measured current and complicating accurate detection. The scalability of MERS to larger designs can be enhanced by integrating it with region-based test generation techniques. These techniques segment a circuit into nearly-isolated regions, allowing MERS to be applied separately to each region. For example, in a processor, MERS can be employed independently to its building blocks, such as the integer execution unit, floating-point datapaths, control logic, and result bus logic. MERS can work with the schemes proposed in [23] to isolate regions and prevent unwanted switching in independent functional modules by leveraging power gating techniques, such as clock gating, supply gating, or operand isolation. Additionally, MERS can be applied to the more flexible region-based side-channel analysis approach proposed in [24], which divides a large design into smaller blocks or regions and activates them one at a time. MERS can generate vectors that maximize activity within each region, and the decision to report a chip as Trojan-infected would be based on the deviation of its region current matrix from that of the golden chip. Future work will include integrating MERS with region-based circuit partitioning techniques to further enhance its effectiveness and evaluating it on larger industry-standard designs.

### 6. Conclusions

A test generation approach like MERS is generally effective for any side-channel analysis methods that rely on activity in Trojan circuits, such as transient current, dynamic power profile, or electromagnetic emanation-based methods. Furthermore, MERS is effective for any form or size of Trojans, as long as they are implanted through alterations in the circuit structure, which is the most common mode of Trojan implantation. Our simulation results on benchmark circuits show that MERS can improve side-channel sensitivity by more than 96.61% compared to random tests for a large set of arbitrary Trojans. This demonstrates that a judicious statistical test generation method like MERS can be an essential component in side-channel Trojan detection. Future work will focus on further improving scalability to larger designs and evaluating MERS with test chip measurements.
