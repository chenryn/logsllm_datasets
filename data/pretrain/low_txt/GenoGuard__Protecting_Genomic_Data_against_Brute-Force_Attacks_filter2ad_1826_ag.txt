### Survey on Privacy Issues and Countermeasures in the Genomic Era

This survey discusses the latest considerations regarding privacy issues and countermeasures in the genomic era. However, existing cryptographic solutions in this domain do not address the long-term threats to encryption, such as those posed by quantum computing [39], or the common short-term threat of brute-force cracking of password-based encryption (PBE) ciphertexts [40], [41], [42].

### Deception and Decoys in Computer Security

In the field of computer security, various practices involving deception and decoys have been employed. Honeypots [43] are fake computer systems designed to attract and track malicious activities. These systems are widely used in intrusion detection systems [44], [45], [46]. Similarly, a honeynet [47] is proposed to assist system administrators in identifying malicious traffic on enterprise networks. The Kamouflage system [48] and honeywords [49] are designed to protect password vaults by creating plausible decoy passwords. Juels and Ristenpart [13] formalized this construction process with the concept of DTE (Decoy Token Encryption) and proposed honey encryption, which provides security beyond the brute-force bound of password-based encryption.

### Conclusion and Future Work

The long-term sensitivity of genomic data necessitates especially strong protective mechanisms. Brute-force attacks on standard encryption schemes, even under strong passwords, should not be considered infeasible in the long term, given the rapid evolution of computing technology and potential algorithmic advances. In the short term, the use of low-entropy keys, such as passwords, poses serious risks to the password-based encryption of genomic data.

We propose GenoGuard, a cryptographic system that offers long-term protection for genomic data against even computationally unbounded adversaries. Decryption attempts against a GenoGuard ciphertext using an incorrect key yield a genome sequence that appears statistically plausible, even to a sophisticated adversary. To achieve this, GenoGuard introduces a novel DTE scheme that efficiently encodes a genome sequence on a ternary tree, sensitive to genetic recombination and mutation, thereby capturing the highly non-uniform probability distribution and special structure of genomic data. Additionally, GenoGuard provides security against adversaries with phenotypic side information (physical traits of victims). We provide a parallelized software implementation of GenoGuard and demonstrate its efficiency and scalability on a cluster of nodes. GenoGuard thus offers a promising approach to the increasingly important challenge of protecting genomic data.

### Appendix: The Recombination Model

Here we describe how to compute the probability of a haploid genotype \( h_{k+1} \), given \( k \) sampled haploid genotypes \(\{h_1, \ldots, h_k\}\) using the forward-backward algorithm for hidden Markov models. The model is borrowed from genetic research, but we try to avoid using too much genetic terminology in this work; for details about some variables and constants, we kindly ask the readers to refer to the original paper [19].

Initially, at state 1, we have:
\[ P(X_1 = x) = \frac{1}{k} \]

The transition probability from state \( j \) to \( j + 1 \) is characterized by:
\[ P(X_{j+1} = x' | X_j = x) = 
\begin{cases} 
\frac{1 - \exp(-\rho_j / k)}{k} + \frac{\exp(-\rho_j / k)}{k} & \text{if } x' = x \\
\frac{1 - \exp(-\rho_j / k)}{k} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \]
where \(\rho_j\) is the genetic distance between locus \( j \) and \( j + 1 \). A smaller genetic distance makes the two states more likely to take the same value, meaning they are more likely to come from the same haploid genotype.

At state \( j \), an allele (0 or 1) will be emitted. To mimic the effects of mutation, the emitting probability is characterized by:
\[ P(h_{k+1,j} = a | X_j = x) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 - \lambda & \text{if } h_{x,j} = a \\
\lambda & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \]
where \( a \) is 0 or 1, and \(\lambda\) is the mutation rate.

Let the forward variable \(\alpha_j(x) = P(h_{k+1, \leq j}, X_j = x)\). Then \(\alpha_1(x) = P(h_{k+1,1} | X_1 = x) P(X_1 = x)\). And \(\alpha_2(x), \ldots, \alpha_n(x)\) can be computed recursively using:
\[ \alpha_{j+1}(x) = \sum_{x'=1}^k \alpha_j(x') P(X_{j+1} = x | X_j = x') P(h_{k+1,j+1} | X_{j+1} = x) \]

The probability of a complete haploid genotype is then computed using:
\[ P(h_{k+1} | h_1, \ldots, h_k) = \sum_{x=1}^k \alpha_n(x) \]

The conditional probability for allele \( j + 1 \), given all preceding alleles, is computed using:
\[ P(h_{k+1,j+1} | h_{k+1, \leq j}, h_1, \ldots, h_k) = \frac{\sum_{x=1}^k \alpha_{j+1}(x)}{\sum_{x=1}^k \alpha_j(x)} \]

For a genome sequence that couples two haploid genotypes, the above quantities can be computed similarly by an extension of this hidden Markov model [21].
