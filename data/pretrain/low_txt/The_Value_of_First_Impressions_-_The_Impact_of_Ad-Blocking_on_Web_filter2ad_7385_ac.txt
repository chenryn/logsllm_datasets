### Indicator of Page Load
Our analysis reveals that users more frequently reported the full page loading (i.e., "loaded everything") compared to just the initial content. The following table summarizes the responses from NAB (No Ad-Block) and AB (Ad-Block) users, as well as those who did not have a majority opinion or skipped the survey:

| Indicator       | NAB Users | AB Users | No Majority | Skipped Survey |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| First Content   | 227       | 15       | 21          | 209            |
| Loaded Everything | 525      | 17       | 5           | -              |

### Discussion
Our measurement study highlights the need for improving the quality of experience (QoE) for users of ad-blockers. The observations are not limited to the specific ad-blocker used in our study but are relevant to any ad-blocker that relies on filter lists. These ad-blockers must check a list of regular expressions to determine whether to block a requested object. While this check may reduce the number of objects loaded and, consequently, lower the Page Load Time (PLT), it can also negatively impact the Time to First Paint (TTFP).

There are several potential paths to optimize ad-blockers based on their impact on QoE. One approach could involve using historical data to identify when ad-blocking significantly degrades TTFP or improves PLT. For such sites, the ad-blocker could delay its checks until after the TTFP, thereby minimizing the impact on the website's initial responsiveness.

Our analysis of ad-blocking's impact on users' web experience is preliminary and focuses on QoE performance metrics such as PLT and TTFP. However, these metrics represent only one aspect of the overall web browsing experience. Future research could explore questions like: Do ad-blockers make web browsing less distracting? Do they improve data privacy? And, despite their performance overhead, do users prefer browsing with ad-blocking enabled?

### Related Work
The rapid adoption of tools to evade or block ads and their impact on the web ecosystem have motivated several recent studies. Pujol et al. [26] examined network-wide advertisement traffic and inferred the prevalence of ad-block usage. They found that 18% of the total requests in the monitored traffic were ad-related.

Malloy et al. [19] studied the global prevalence and impact of ad-blockers using a dataset of 2 million users and over 20 billion page views across half a million top-level domains. Their findings indicate that ad-blockers can significantly affect publishers' revenue, causing a $3.9M/month negative impact for a particular publisher.

Walls et al. [34] focused on Adblock Plus and its Acceptable Ads program, which allows some advertisers to pay to have their ads shown. Their user study revealed that not all ads in the program adhere to the stated policies.

Other works have analyzed how filter lists work, particularly in the context of anti-adblocking [37]. These studies focus on understanding how filter lists identify anti-adblocking functionality on websites but do not examine the time it takes to process the regular expressions in these lists.

Recent research has also explored effective defenses against JavaScript-based advertisements [10, 16], finding that a small number of rules can block a large majority of ads without compromising security.

Our work addresses a previously unexplored side effect of ad-blocker usage: their impact on users' QoE. Web QoE has received significant attention, with efforts focusing on improving page load times through new network protocols [17, 31], web architectures [22, 27, 28, 36], and tools. Studies by Kelton et al. [15] and Butkiewicz et al. [6] present alternative approaches and non-traditional metrics to model users' QoE.

### Conclusions
The growing prevalence of online advertisements has driven research to understand their scale, mechanisms, and economics, while also fueling the adoption of ad-blocking services. Our study provides the first detailed analysis of ad-blocking's impact on user Web QoE using the most popular web-based ad-blocker to evaluate common QoE metrics for the top 5,000 Alexa websites.

We found that while ad-blocking reduces the number of objects loaded, leading to improved PLT, this often comes at a high cost to TTFP for a significant fraction of sites. Results from a large crowdsourced experiment with 1,000 Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) users indicate that 71.5% of the time, users preferred faster TTFP over shorter PLT, emphasizing the importance of first impressions in web QoE.

While our evaluation was extensive, it focused on one aspect of web QoE. Understanding other aspects of the experience with ad-blocking remains an area for future work. We are also exploring ways to leverage our findings to optimize ad-block users' experience, which will become increasingly relevant as browsers move towards blocking ads [4, 38].
