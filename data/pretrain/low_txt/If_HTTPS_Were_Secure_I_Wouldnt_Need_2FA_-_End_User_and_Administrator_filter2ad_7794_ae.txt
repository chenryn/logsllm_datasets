### Introduction

Our research often encounters protocol components and technical terms without accompanying explanations of their functionality and purpose within the protocol configuration. Our findings suggest that:

1. Many users confuse encryption with authentication.
2. End users tend to assume the omnipotence of attackers and significantly underestimate the security benefits of HTTPS.
3. Both administrators and end users generally ignore or even distrust security indicators.

### Key Insights

Our work provides insights into the usability challenges identified by Krombholz et al. [4], which are often responsible for vulnerable HTTPS configurations. Our results explain why users frequently fail to correctly assess the implications of clicking through security warnings. Additionally, we provide a foundation for the future design of cryptographic protocols that are easier for administrators and developers to deploy, thereby minimizing the exposure of end users to security-critical decisions during online communication.

### Future Work

Future work should explore how our findings can inform the design of future cryptographic protocols. We believe our results can guide a larger (quantitative) study using closed-ended questions. Such a study could also include questions on administrator qualifications and knowledge to measure large-scale effects and perform multivariate analyses.
