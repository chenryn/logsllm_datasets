### Problem
The footer currently reads:
> © Copyright 2021 - 2012 John Hunter, Darren Dale, Eric Firing, Michael Droettboom, and the Matplotlib development team; 2012 - 2021 The Matplotlib development team.

The year range "2021 - 2012" is incorrect and should be corrected.

### Suggested Improvement
Update the footer to:
> © Copyright 2012 - 2021 John Hunter, Darren Dale, Eric Firing, Michael Droettboom, and the Matplotlib development team.

### Matplotlib Version
