## Malware and Hacking

The problem of malware and computer-based theft is increasing in both frequency and complexity:
- The number of unique keyloggers and malware identified by the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) has increased during 2008.
- According to CSI/FBI reports, businesses lost over $21 million due to fraud and more than $10 million due to various malicious software infections.
- The Department of Justice argues that it is now more profitable to engage in computer crime than drug trafficking.

## Criminological Research

Social science research has explored the malware and hacking community to some extent:
- Hackers and malware writers operate within a technology-focused subculture that values skill and ability.
- They have relatively loose connections but sometimes work in teams to create programs or hack systems.
- Few systematic examinations of the malware and hacker community have focused on social ties and interests.
- Generally, no predictive research has been conducted.

## Online Resources

The malware and hacking community utilizes online resources that can be actively mined for information. This study will examine the social networks of the malware and hacking community in Russia and Eastern Europe using data generated from social networking blogs. Blogs provide important information on:
- Current and emerging threats
- The relationships and behavior of attackers
- Locations, attitudes, and beliefs

### Self-Report Information

Each LiveJournal (LJ) profile allows users to provide information on their:
- **Location**: From current educational listing, ICQ profile, or other online contact information.
- **Education**: Assuming the standard Russian educational trajectory, we can assign the age with some margin of error.
- **Biographies**: Sometimes provide useful information on the psychological status of the user or whether the journal is friends-only.
- **Interests**: Can include political affiliation, geographical location, and personal interests.
- **Friends**: People whom the user reads and who can have access to 'friends-only' entries.
- **Also friend of**: People who read this journal and do not have access to protected entries.
- **Mutual friends**: Both users added each other.
- **Communities**: LJ groups that the individual belongs to.

## Data and Methods

This study uses a sample of members from multiple hacker groups with connected forums known to sell and trade malicious software and stolen data:
- The content of each blog was downloaded and translated by a native speaker.
- Google searches were conducted for each individual to determine their involvement in the hacker community.
- Network analyses were conducted to indicate the centrality of users with high perceived threat levels.

### Membership Risk Levels by Group

| Group | No Threat | Low Threat | Medium Threat | High Threat | Total |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| BH    | 154       | 12         | 34            | 8           | 208   |
| CU    | 24        | 2          | 4             | 2           | 32    |
| DL    | 30        | 8          | 8             | 8           | 54    |
| HN    | 0         | 0          | 0             | 4           | 4     |
| HZ    | 180       | 12         | 38            | 4           | 234   |
| MF    | 16        | 0          | 8             | 4           | 28    |
| RU    | 10        | 0          | 4             | 4           | 18    |
| Total | 414       | 34         | 96            | 34          | 578   |

### Extrapolating Data: Location

- **From current educational listing**
- **From ICQ profile or other online contact information**
- **From communities**: If the user belongs to communities devoted to finding jobs in particular locations.
- **From Interests**: The user can indicate heightened interests in particular locations.
- Each of these categories is further corroborated by reading the journal entries.

### Extrapolating Data: Age

- **Education**: Assuming the standard Russian educational trajectory, we can assign the age with some margin of error.
- **ICQ profiles**
- **Journal entries**: Users are often congratulated on their birthdays, especially for ages 18-20.

### Extrapolating Data: Threat

- **Threat scores** were created and assigned based on results from Google searches on the handle provided:
  - **0**: No threat
  - **1**: Computer security blogger
  - **2**: Low-level hacker
  - **3**: High-level hacker

### General Details

- 70% of users have very low perceived risk.
- 13% of users did not provide physical locations in profiles.
- 6% of users provided locations that do not exist.
- 15% of profiles are friends-only.
- 7 females.
- 3 virtual identities.

### Example of Age Identification

- **Zdeusz**:
  - Graduated from high school in 2002.
  - Studied at the university from 2003 to 2008.
  - Spent one year working or preparing to study at the university.
  - Assuming he graduated from school at 16 and studied for 5 years at the university, this puts him at 22 years old, born in 1986.

### General Educational Information

  - **perajok**: Journal from "We not I" (somebody and Irena Ponaroshku, which translates as Irena Pretending), mostly devoted to music.

### Initial Predictive Analysis

- An ANOVA analysis was conducted based on the frequency of interests in various categories:
  - **Malware**: Significant (F-Statistic: 0.0282)
  - **Operating Systems**: Significant (F-Statistic: 0.0135)
  - **Drugs & Alcohol**: Not Significant (F-Statistic: 0.4703)
  - **Assembly Language**: Not Significant (F-Statistic: 0.4881)

- **Findings**:
  - Individuals with higher threat levels express more specific and detailed interests in software techniques and methods, rather than general topics of interest.
  - **Threat Level = 0**: Might list "hacks" as a general interest.
  - **Threat Level = 2 or 3**: May list all of the following: "botnets, buffer overflows, iOS kernel hack, phreaking, rootkits, immunity debugger."

### Mutual Friends Networks

- The complete network of all members and friends, color-coded by group:
  - **Red**: Damagelab
  - **Yellow**: BH Crew
  - **Green**: Cup
  - **Blue**: HZ
  - **Purple**: MF
  - **White**: HK

### Discussion and Conclusions

- A significant amount of information can be generated from social networking data.
- The Russian hacker community is relatively centrally located in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
- Gender and education reflect general research on the community.
- Groups are well-connected, and particularly threatening hackers are densely connected.
- A small percentage of the members appear to be overtly involved in hacking and malware.
- Groups are densely connected and redundant networks exist, indicating insulation, which may be why so many tools and attacks are continuously recycled and pushed from skilled to unskilled.
- Interests may be a critical predictor of hacker behavior.
- Multinomial regression models can be developed to identify factors that help determine the threat level of hackers.
- Test computer simulations of hacker-networks behavior.
