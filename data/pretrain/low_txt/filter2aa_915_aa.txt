  - **Case Reference**: United States v. Prochner, 417 F.3d 54 (D. Mass. July 22, 2005)

### In re Innovatio IP Ventures, LLC Patent Litigation
- **Patent Owners of Wireless Internet Technology vs. Commercial Users**
  - **Allegations**: By making wireless internet available, users infringed various claims of 17 patents.
  - **Decision**: Data packets sent over unencrypted wireless networks are readily accessible to the general public using basic equipment.
  - **Exception to Wiretap Act**: The communications fall under the exception where "electronic communication is readily accessible to the general public."
  - **Admissibility of Evidence**: Evidence obtained using the protocol is admissible at patent infringement trials with proper foundation (18 U.S.C.A. § 2511(2)(g)(i)).

### Self-Defense in the Physical World
- **Constitutional Rights**: Twenty-one state constitutions explicitly recognize the rights to self-defense and defense of property as generally inalienable.
- **Common Law Doctrine**: Trespass to Chattel
  - **Recovery of Damages**: Actual damages for impairment or loss of use of property.
  - **Use of Reasonable Force**: Permissible to protect possession against even harmless interference.
  - **Prevention Over Recovery**: The law favors preventing trespass over post-trespass recovery.
- **Case References**:
  - **Intel v. Hamidi, 71 P.2d (Cal. Sp. Ct. June 30, 2003)**: Right to exclude people from personal property is not unlimited.
  - **Moore v. State, 634 N.E.2d 825 (Ind. App. 1994) and Pointer v. State, 585 N.E.2d 33 (Ind. App. 1992)**: Common-law right to protect property excludes the use of deadly force.

### Building the Case of Reasonableness
- **Defense of Property**: Conduct is justified if an aggressor unjustifiably threatens property and the actor uses reasonable force to protect it.
- **Measures Done to Secure and Defend**:
  - **Technology**: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems, Intrusion Prevention Systems, Real-Time Network Awareness, SSL Proxy, Logging/Monitoring, Honeypots/Honeynets/Honeytokens.
  - **Intelligence/Situational Awareness**: Open Source Intelligence, US-CERT, Commercial Intelligence Providers.
  - **IA/Policies/Training**: Information Assurance, Policies, and Training.
  - **Information Control**: Managing and protecting sensitive information.
  - **Active Defense**: Proactive measures to defend against threats.
  - **Deception**: Misleading attackers to protect assets.
  - **Recovery Operations**: Actions to restore systems and data after an incident.
  - **Coordination with Law Enforcement**: Ongoing coordination to ensure legal compliance and support.

### Wiretap Statute: Rights or Property Exception
- **18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(a)(i)**: Providers may intercept or disclose communications in the normal course of employment to protect their rights or property.
- **Case Reference**: U.S. v. McLaren, 957 F. Supp. 215, 219 (M.D. Fla. 1997).

### Intellectual Property and Trade Secrets

- **Spear Phishing**: Targeted email attacks.
- **Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 1051 et seq.)**: National system of trademark registration to protect against consumer confusion and dilution of famous marks.

- **Section 1831**: Economic Espionage
- **Section 1832**: Theft of Trade Secrets
- **Amendment**: Recent amendments extend protection against misappropriation.
