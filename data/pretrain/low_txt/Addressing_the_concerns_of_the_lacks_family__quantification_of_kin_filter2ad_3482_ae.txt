### Figure 9: Attacker’s Uncertainty about Values of 100 SNPs on Chromosome 1 for Two Families

In Figure 9, we illustrate the reduction in genomic privacy with respect to 100 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 1. We first present the different levels of privacy when using all 100 SNPs from an observed relative (either I1 or I2). Then, we show the same analysis using only 50 SNPs but incorporating Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) values.

We observe that the use of LD slightly decreases privacy more for the first family than for the second family. This is because the 50 SNPs randomly selected for the second family had weaker LD relationships with other SNPs. Additionally, the difference between the two observation cases (50 SNPs with LD and 100 SNPs without LD) is more pronounced for close relatives (e.g., mother, child, or sibling) compared to more distant relatives.

### Health Privacy Evaluation

We also evaluated the health privacy of the family members of I1 and I2, considering their predispositions to various diseases. We found that almost all important SNPs associated with privacy-sensitive diseases, such as Alzheimer's, ischemic heart disease, and macular degeneration, were revealed by I1 and I2. Due to space constraints, we focus on Alzheimer's, which is one of the most significant diseases primarily attributable to genetic factors. The presence of two ApoE4 alleles (in SNPs rs7412 and rs429358 located on chromosome 19) is a key indicator of increased risk for Alzheimer's.

### Related Work

Stajano et al. [46] were among the first to raise the issue of kin privacy in genomics. Cassa et al. [19] provided a framework for measuring the risks to siblings when someone reveals their SNPs. They demonstrated that the inference error is significantly reduced when the sibling's SNPs are known, compared to when only population frequencies are used.

Our work extends this by considering any type of family member and the LD relationship between SNPs. We propose and evaluate different privacy metrics and present a real attack scenario using publicly available data. Our generic framework accounts for any observation of a family's genomic data and the adversary's background knowledge.

Several algorithms for inference on graphical models have been proposed in the context of pedigree analysis. Exact inference techniques on Bayesian networks are used to map disease genes and construct genetic maps [26, 34, 38]. Monte Carlo methods, such as Gibbs sampling, have also proven effective for genetic analyses in complex pedigrees [31, 44, 48]. These methods aim to infer specific genotypes given phenotypes (like diseases). Another paper uses Gibbs sampling to infer haplotypes from genotype data [36]. Genotype imputation [39] is another technique used by geneticists to complete missing SNPs based on given genotyped data. A similar approach has recently been used to infer high-density genotypes in pedigrees, relying on low-resolution genotypes and identity-by-descent regions of the genome [18]. However, none of these contributions address privacy concerns.

### Research on Genomic Data Privacy

Homer et al. [30] proved that de-identification is an ineffective way to protect the privacy of genomic data, a finding supported by other works [27, 50, 52]. Recently, Gymrek et al. [29] showed how they identified the DNA of several individuals who participated in scientific studies. Fienberg et al. [25] proposed using differential privacy to protect the identities of study participants, though this approach reduces the accuracy of research results. Some works focus on protecting the privacy of genomic data while preserving utility in medical tests, such as searching for particular patterns in DNA sequences [16, 49], comparing the similarity of DNA sequences [15, 17, 32], and performing statistical analysis on multiple DNA sequences [35]. Ayday et al. [7, 14] proposed privacy-preserving schemes for medical tests and personalized medicine methods using patients' genomic data. For privacy-preserving clinical genomics, researchers have suggested outsourcing some costly computations to public clouds or semi-trusted service providers [21, 51]. Finally, Ayday et al. [13] proposed techniques for privacy-preserving management of raw genomes.

### Conclusion and Future Work

We have proposed a novel reconstruction attack to infer the genomic data of individuals from the observed genomes of their relatives and have compared several metrics to quantify genomic and health privacy. As Rebecca Skloot, the author of "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks," noted, the precision of genomic data can be highly beneficial for personalized medicine but can also have devastating consequences for a family's peace of mind. The Lacks family is just one example, but in the future, family members may have divergent opinions on revealing genomic data, leading to dissent. It is crucial for the security research community to prepare for this challenge.

In future work, we plan to apply our proposed framework to more pedigrees to fine-tune our numerical results. We will also study the trade-off between the utility and privacy of genomic data to design an optimized Genomic Privacy-Preserving Mechanism (GPPM).
