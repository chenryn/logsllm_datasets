## Abstract
Cloud-based systems undergo more frequent changes compared to traditional systems. These changes often involve sporadic operations such as installation and upgrades. Such operations manipulate cloud resources and are prone to unpredictable and inevitable failures, largely due to the inherent uncertainties in cloud environments. To recover from these failures, effective cloud operational recovery strategies are essential. However, existing recovery methods have several limitations, including poor generalizability of exception handling mechanisms and the coarse-grained nature of rollback mechanisms.

This thesis introduces a novel and innovative recovery approach called **POD-Recovery** for sporadic operations on cloud. The key novelties of POD-Recovery include:
1. It is based on eight cloud operational recovery requirements formulated by us (e.g., recovery time objective satisfaction and recovery generalizability).
2. It is non-intrusive and does not modify the code implementing the sporadic operation.

POD-Recovery operates in the following manner:
- It treats a sporadic operation as a process, providing the workflow and contextual information for each step.
- It identifies recovery points within the operation, determines the unified resource space (the types of resources required and manipulated), and generates expected resource state templates for all operational steps.
- For a given recovery point, it filters applicable recovery patterns from the eight supported patterns, automatically generates recovery actions, and evaluates them based on metrics such as Recovery Time, Recovery Cost, and Recovery Impact.
- This evaluation leads to the selection of an acceptable recovery action for execution.

We implemented and evaluated POD-Recovery by recovering from faults injected into five representative types of sporadic operations on cloud. The experimental results show that POD-Recovery can perform operational recovery while satisfying all recovery requirements and outperforms existing recovery methods for cloud operations.
