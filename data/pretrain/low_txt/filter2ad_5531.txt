## Abstract
As the volume of cyber security incident data, such as system logs and vulnerability scan results, continues to grow, manual analysis becomes impractical. Consequently, data mining techniques have become essential for real-world cyber security applications. A Gartner report [4] highlights that "information security is becoming a big data analytics problem, where massive amounts of data will be correlated, analyzed, and mined for meaningful patterns." The ultimate goal is to provide cyber security analysts with prioritized actionable insights derived from big data.

However, a critical challenge in applying data mining to cyber security is the presence of malicious adversaries who continuously adapt their behavior to evade detection and render data mining models ineffective. Traditional data mining techniques are insufficient to handle such adversarial scenarios. Over the past few years, the machine learning and data mining communities have developed new and robust techniques to address these challenges. This tutorial aims to provide an overview of recent developments in adversarial data mining, focusing on its foundations, techniques, and applications in cyber security.

## 1. Overview
The existence of malicious attackers who attempt to evade detection necessitates the development of resilient data analytics techniques. These techniques must be able to quickly detect previously unknown attack instances. To counter adversarial behaviors, various adversarial data mining techniques have been developed, including our own prior research.

This tutorial is designed for an audience interested in applying data mining techniques to cyber security challenges. Basic knowledge of statistics and standard supervised and unsupervised learning techniques is beneficial.

### 1.1 Foundations of Adversarial Data Mining
One intuitive approach to combat adversaries is to allow the classifier to adapt to their actions, either manually or automatically. For example, a naive Bayes classifier and an adversary playing optimal strategies can be modeled as a game between two cost-sensitive opponents [2]. However, this leads to a continuous, never-ending game between the classifier and the adversary.

In online learning, strategic games are used to learn concepts in real-time or make predictions by seeing instances one at a time [1]. In the first part of the tutorial, we will discuss these theoretical foundations and their implications for cyber security tasks.

### 1.2 Adversarial Data Mining Techniques
In the second part of the tutorial, we will delve into the different approaches developed for adversarial data mining. We will explore the two-player game model [3], where the adversary aims to maximize its return while the data miner tries to minimize misclassification costs. We will examine the classifier's performance and the adversary's behavior at equilibrium points.

In an adversarial environment, the initial success of a classifier has little impact on its long-term performance, even if it is constantly adjusted to combat new threats. We will discuss how to choose effective features for adversarial data mining applications and introduce optimal support vector machine (SVM) learning strategies against free-range and restrained attack models [9, 8].

### 1.3 Cyber Security Applications
We will focus on intrusion detection and mobile malware detection as key application areas for adversarial data mining.

#### Intrusion Detection
Detecting information flows and flow changes is crucial in complex and multi-scale data networks. Adversaries can hide their identity through stepping-stone attacks, using compromised hosts to relay commands. The network defender must detect these connections and trace them back to the attacker. Adversarial data mining techniques offer an alternative approach to intrusion detection. We will discuss how these techniques can be applied and survey previous data mining approaches [7] in light of recent advancements.

#### Mobile Malware Detection
As smartphone software becomes more complex, more malware programs exploit specific weaknesses. Smartphones collectively form a powerful mobile network, making them attractive targets for adversaries. Malicious activities on mobile phones often use lightweight applications to avoid detection. Static and dynamic analysis techniques have been proposed, but they have limitations. We will discuss the weaknesses of traditional data mining techniques against mobile malware that randomizes its actions and how adversarial data mining models with carefully chosen utility functions can be more effective.
