### Issue Resolution and Data Processing

- **Resolution**: The issue has been resolved, including deduplication and prioritization.
- **Alternative Solution**:
  ```spl
  | inputlookup Premium
  | append [ | inputlookup OpenSource ]
  | munge
  | outputlookup MyList
  ```

### Analysis – Value Add

- **Strength of Automation in Splunk**: High-fidelity alerts. This was a simple example, but you can make it more impressive by tracking whether the IP is in the US or checking for recent malware events on a specific host.
  ```spl
  | join host [
    `tstats` count from datamodel=Malware by Malware_Attacks.dest
    | stats count by Malware_Attacks.dest
    | rename Malware_Attacks.dest as host
  ]
  ```

### Action

- **PANBlock! (Or Other Network Response)**:
  - **Challenges**: Many organizations fear automated response due to potential downtime.
  - **Solution**: Start with high-confidence alerts and a limited list of assets, and verify success.
  - **Alternative Solution**: Use the UI for manual response.
- **If You Don’t Run Palo Alto Networks**:
  - **Solution**: While PAN/Splunk have made this work out of the box, this has been implemented many times with various products, including:
    - **Cisco Border Router**: Expect Script to block.
    - **Check Point R80 Rest Interface**: Contact me if you want to do this.

### Scenario Two: Anomaly Detection Essentials

- **File Auditing** is a common practice and can be accomplished quickly and easily in Splunk. It becomes harder at scale, but data model acceleration helps.
- **Ultimately**, by mastering anomaly detection, you can more effectively find difficult-to-detect issues in your systems.
- **Visibility**: Carbon Black Logs
- **Analysis**: System Distribution, accelerated via Data Models
- **Action**: Security Incident Creation

### What is Standard Deviation?

- **Definition**: A measure of the variance for a series of numbers.
- **Example**:
  - One file is opened on 100, 123, 79, and 145 hosts per day: average of 111.75 and a standard deviation of 28.53.
  - Another file is opened on 100, 342, 3, and 2 hosts per day: average of 111.75, but a standard deviation of 160.23.

### Visibility – Log Examples

```json
{
  "action": "write",
  "timestamp": 1410911994,
  "path": "c:\\Program Files\\Splunk\\bin\\splunk-perfmon.exe",
  "type": "filemod",
  "process_guid": 36661217281
}
```

### How to Accelerate

- **Acceleration** facilitates better and broader analysis. Splunk has several ways to accelerate content:
  - Report Acceleration
  - Data Model Acceleration
  - TSCollect
  - Summary Indexing
  - Pre-processing of logs
- **Check out Gerald Kanapathy’s Session on Friday**:
  - **Title**: Splunk Search Acceleration Technologies
  - **Speaker**: Gerald Kanapathy, Sr. Director Product Management, Splunk
  - **When**: 10/09/2014, 10:30 AM – 11:30 AM

### Analysis – Create Data Model

- **Create a data model and accelerate**.

### Analysis – Create Pivot Search

- **Create a baseline pivot search and open in Search**.
- **Split `dc(host)` by path**.
- **Add a filter for critical paths**.

### Analysis – Add Additional Statistics

- **Add additional stats commands** on top of the accelerated pivot search.

### Analysis – Show Only Suspect Entries

- **Filter to show only suspect entries**.

### Action – Create a New Incident

- **Will work with essentially any ticketing system, possibly via a scripted alert**.
- **Every Ticketing System Accepts Emails too!** Known to work with:

### Scenario Three: Behavioral Anomaly Detection

- **Detecting known bad is great, but leaves you vulnerable**. Augment with synthetic checks of sensitive systems.
- **Statistics can consume all your time**:
  - **Easiest to leverage soft approval (e.g., emails to managers) with standard deviation**.
  - **Additionally, use hard enforcement for large deviations (e.g., FW isolation)**.
- **In this scenario, we are a hospital tracking patient chart opens**.
- **Visibility**: Charting System Logs
- **Analysis**: Frequency Analysis by User, Role, etc.
- **Action**: Email the employees’ manager to investigate.

### What is Standard Deviation?

- **Definition**: A measure of the variance for a series of numbers.
- **Example**:
  - Jane opens 100, 123, 79, and 145 charts per day: average of 111.75 and a standard deviation of 28.53.
  - Jack opens 100, 342, 3, and 2 charts per day: average of 111.75, but a standard deviation of 160.23.
  - When Jack and Jane both open 500 records some day, that will be 13.6 standard deviations (z=13.6) for Jane but only 2.42 for Jack.
  - **Z score = number of standard deviations away**.
