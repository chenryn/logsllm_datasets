### Orthogonality to Congestion Control

The discussed approach is largely orthogonal to congestion control. We believe that congestion control is a more fundamental mechanism for network resource allocation. Some flow scheduling schemes, such as those described in [43], have been used in conjunction with congestion control to minimize flow completion times. pFabric treats the network as a single switch and performs shortest job first (SJF) scheduling, assuming the flow size is known in advance. This approach requires modifications to the switches. PIAS [11] makes this approach more practical by approximating SJF using a multi-level feedback queue with priority queuing in commodity switches, without requiring knowledge of individual flow sizes. pHost [26] also uses credit (token) packets, but for scheduling packets/flows rather than for congestion control. It assumes a congestion-free network by utilizing a network with full bisection bandwidth and packet spraying. Additionally, pHost requires prior knowledge of individual flow sizes.

### Router-Assisted Congestion Control

Some congestion control algorithms require in-network support [24, 30, 35, 42]. These mechanisms introduce a form of in-network feedback, where switches explicitly participate in rate allocation for each flow. To achieve fast convergence, PERC [34] and FCP [30] employ mechanisms for end-hosts to signal their bandwidth demand to the switches, which necessitate changes in the switches. In ExpressPass, we use credit packets to signal demand and merely use rate-limiting, which does not require switch modifications. Finally, RC3 [42] uses in-network priority queues to fill up the available bandwidth in one round-trip time (RTT). We believe this technique can be applied to credit packets to achieve similar benefits, but we leave this as future work.

### Conclusion

In this work, we introduce ExpressPass, an end-to-end credit-based congestion control mechanism. We use end-to-end credit transfer for bandwidth allocation and fine-grained packet scheduling. We explore the key benefits of a credit-based design and demonstrate that it opens up a new design space for more efficient congestion control. Specifically, the use of credit enables:
1. Low-cost bandwidth probing without queue build-up.
2. Scheduling the arrival of data packets at packet granularity.

We address key challenges in realizing a credit-based congestion control and show that it can be implemented using commodity switches. By shaping the flow of credit packets at the switch, ExpressPass effectively controls congestion even before sending data packets. This results in fast convergence and drastically reduces the flow completion time (FCT) for small flows. ExpressPass requires only a small amount of buffer. Our evaluation shows that ExpressPass:
1. Outperforms other congestion control algorithms.
2. Ensures high utilization and fairness even with many concurrent flows.
3. Provides even greater benefits over other algorithms as link speeds increase.
