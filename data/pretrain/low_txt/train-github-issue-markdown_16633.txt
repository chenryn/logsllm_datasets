Hello,

I am trying to set up the `react-styleguidist` node module, as documented [here](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/docs/webpack#create-react-app-typescript). For it to function correctly, the module needs access to the `webpack.config.js` file. Could you please guide me on how to expose this configuration to the `react-styleguidist` module?

Thank you for your help.
