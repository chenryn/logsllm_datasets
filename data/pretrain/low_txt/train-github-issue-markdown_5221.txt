#### Guideline 2.1 - Performance - App Completeness
We were unable to review your app because it crashed on launch on a Mac running macOS 10.15.3. We have attached detailed crash logs to help you troubleshoot this issue.

**Next Steps:**
- Please revise and test your app on a device to ensure it launches without crashing.

**Resources:**
- For information on how to symbolicate and read a crash log, please refer to [Technical Note TN2151: Understanding and Analyzing Application Crash Reports](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2151/_index.html).

#### Guideline 2.5.1 - Performance - Software Requirements
Your app uses or references the following non-public APIs:
- Symbols: `_vDSP_deq22D`, `_vDSP_vsma`

The use of non-public APIs is not permitted on the App Store, as it can lead to a poor user experience if these APIs change.

**Next Steps:**
- If you are using third-party libraries, please update to the most recent version.
- If you do not have access to the library's source code, you can use the `strings` or `otool` command-line tools to identify the problematic code.
  - The `strings` tool can output a list of the methods that the library calls.
  - The `otool -ov` command will output the Objective-C class structures and their defined methods.

Continued use or concealment of non-public APIs in future submissions may result in the termination of your Apple Developer account and the removal of all associated apps from the App Store.

**Resources:**
- If there are no alternatives for providing the required functionality, you can submit an enhancement request via the [Feedback Assistant](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/).
- If you are unable to reproduce the issue, ensure you are testing the exact version of the app that was submitted for review, and do so in a minimally privileged environment. See [Technical Q&A QA1778: How to Reproduce Bugs Reported Against Mac App Store Submissions](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1778/_index.html) for more details.
