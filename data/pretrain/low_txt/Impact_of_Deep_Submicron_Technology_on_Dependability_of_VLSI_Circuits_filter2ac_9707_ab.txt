### Analysis and Observations

Over 16 months, 60 out of 193 machines (31%) experienced no errors. 81 servers (42%) reported between one and five errors. Five servers (2.6%) reported over 1000 errors. Further analysis revealed that 14 machines were affected by intermittent faults in the memory subsystem. 

As an example, Fig. 4 shows the daily number of single-bit errors observed in one system. The first six months of the study showed errors attributed to transient faults. A significant burst of errors was observed at the beginning of the seventh month, indicating the possible presence of intermittent faults. An intermittent fault was confirmed in the tenth month, and after repair, the stream of errors ceased. The source of the last two sets of errors, observed towards the end of the study, remains unidentified.

### Impact of Shrinking Geometries on Dependability

As geometries shrink, process variations are expected to negatively affect the dependability of interconnects. Varying etch rates can modify the wire cross-section, and the thickness of metallic and dielectric layers may change over the die surface. This can lead to electromigration, producing opens in narrower sections of wires and shorts between adjacent or crossing conductors where the dielectric layer is thinner. These issues may initially manifest as intermittent faults. Additionally, leakage due to direct tunneling through thin oxide layers and manufacturing residuals can lead to intermittent contacts in deep submicron circuits.

### Case Studies

#### Case Study A

Large numbers of corrected single-bit errors were observed in about 1% of systems equipped with a particular controller. Sample units were selected for failure analysis. Test vectors suggested a speed path failure mode, similar to a resistive signal path. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a smaller via with an abnormal signature. Focused ion beam cross-section analysis found partial metal separation and a ring of resistive material, likely due to excessive polymer hardening during plasma etching. ECC corrected the single-bit errors, but had the failed via been part of a control path, SDC would have occurred. In very narrow interconnects, even small amounts of residuals can create intermittent contacts and corrupt data.

#### Case Study B

Ten systems suspected of experiencing single and multi-bit errors underwent an environmental test, known as the four corners test. The test varied temperature from -10°C to 70°C and power supply voltages from nominal values to ±5%, ±6%, and ±10%. A Linpack benchmark was executed to detect SDC. Nine out of ten systems experienced SDC, with 134 out of 148 errors being SDC (90.5%). Failure analysis showed clock failures and setup/hold time violations, responsible for multi-bit data errors, especially during write cycles. Errors often occurred in bursts, making recovery difficult.

### Conclusions

The dependability of COTS VLSI circuits is becoming increasingly important as these devices are used in high-confidence and life-critical systems. While semiconductor technology advances have increased performance, shrinking geometries, lower power voltages, and higher frequencies negatively impact dependability by increasing the occurrence of transient and intermittent faults. These faults can silently corrupt data. 

Analysis of deep submicron technology trends indicates that particle-induced transients, particularly alpha particles, will remain a major source of soft errors. Multi-bit errors are more likely as junction size and critical charge decrease. The impact of interconnects on circuit dependability is expected to increase, with smaller features and modified wire cross-sections raising the likelihood of timing violations. Process variations and manufacturing residuals will be another major source of errors. 

To address these challenges, architectural solutions currently used in custom-designed fault-tolerant systems will need to be embedded into COTS VLSI circuits, especially microprocessors. Enhanced concurrent error detection and correction, time and space redundancy, and triplication and voting will become common. Field data collection, failure analysis, and fault injection will play a key role in understanding new failure modes and error propagation. Failure prediction and better modeling tools for transient and intermittent faults will also be crucial.
