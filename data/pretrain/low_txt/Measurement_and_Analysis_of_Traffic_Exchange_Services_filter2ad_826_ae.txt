### 18% HitLeap
**Table 8: Overlap of IP Address Space Across Various Exchanges**
- 18% of HitLeap's IP address space overlaps with that of EasyHits4U.
- 43–74% of the address space of smaller autosurf networks is also seen in other exchanges.
- For larger networks, 31% of HitLeap’s IP address space overlaps with that of Jingling.

### 6.3 Impressions Per Day Estimates
In this section, we estimate the number of daily impressions served by these exchanges. Our estimates are based on the daily number of unique IP addresses recorded in our logs. However, two factors can lead to overestimation or underestimation:
1. **IP Address Aliasing**: The same machine switching IP addresses.
2. **Multiple Machines Behind NATs**: Multiple devices sharing a single IP address.

To adjust for these factors, we analyzed cookie data from our web logs. We found that:
- 85–95% of IP addresses in manual exchanges returned the same cookie set on the first visit.
- 80–85% of IP addresses in basic autosurf exchanges returned the same cookie set on the first visit.
- 20–45% of IP addresses in advanced autosurf exchanges returned the same cookie set on the first visit.

Further investigation revealed that a high fraction of IP addresses in advanced autosurf exchanges clear cookies after every visit.

Due to the limitations of cookie data, we report our population estimates at the granularity of IP addresses. We use these population sizes to estimate the total number of impressions served per day by each exchange. Specifically, we compute the average number of impression requests received by our milker bots and multiply it by the population size of the exchange. Table 9 lists the estimated impressions per day.

### 7. Discussion
In the previous sections, we measured various aspects of traffic exchanges. In this section, we draw plausible inferences based on our observations.

#### 7.1 Selection Pressure
We find evidence that traffic fraud responds to selection pressure. The existence of exchanges, which disperse the originating IP addresses of traffic, indicates that advertisers actively look for fraud. Clicking endlessly from a single IP address seldom achieves the desired result. The differences between the free and premium versions of advanced autosurf tools (as shown in Table 1) largely reflect the ability to target specific geographic locations and to set custom User-Agent and Referer fields. These features likely provide meaningful advantages, suggesting that they are used to detect fraudulent traffic and increase profits.

#### 7.2 Manual vs. Autosurf Exchanges
A common property of these exchanges is that they facilitate the dispersion of traffic. Beyond this, we found little similarity between manual and autosurf exchanges. Table 4 shows that the most popular destinations for traffic from autosurf exchanges have ad-bearing properties, and ad-fraud dominates their traffic. By contrast, Table 3 shows that traffic from manual exchanges is predominantly directed at sites that advertise affiliate programs, other manual traffic exchanges, or pages advertising goods sold by the participants themselves.

In other words, pages visited in manual exchanges appear to be directed at luring humans (the exchange participants) to upgrade, join other exchanges or affiliate programs, or purchase products that do not have mainstream appeal. Our inspection of manual exchange traffic turned up numerous examples of implausible propositions and get-rich-quick schemes. For example, one site asks $9.99 for a pamphlet explaining how to “run your car on water.” Many destinations of manual exchange traffic appear to be Ponzi or multi-level marketing schemes.

#### 7.3 Monetization
Monetization poses a significant problem even if one can generate well-dispersed traffic. The direct cash-out payments offered by the exchanges are low: $0.30 per thousand manual clicks for EasyHits4U, and $0.02 per thousand automated clicks at eBesucher (though getting paid requires a photo ID). Based on Table 9, this amounts to 2 cents per machine per day, or $7.30 per machine per year.

For fraudsters, exploiting sites such as YouTube, which offer to pay for delivered traffic, represents an appealing approach. This has the benefit of low start-up costs: the fraudster simply sets up a channel with some content to which they direct the traffic, avoiding the costs associated with registering a domain and hosting. If the fraud is discovered and the channel blocked, one can simply start over by setting up a new channel. Figure 1 suggests that services such as YouTube successfully detect a good percentage of inorganic traffic, making it hard to linearly translate automatically generated views into money. Participants may direct traffic to YouTube primarily for increasing view counts to gain popularity rather than for monetization.

#### 7.4 Lack of Sophistication
Some of our data supports the view that many traffic exchange participants lack technical sophistication and struggle to monetize their efforts, particularly on the manual exchanges. At first sight, the manual exchanges operate as web traffic brokers, offering free traffic/advertising in exchange for clicks. The exchange extracts money from participants via the exchange ratio (i.e., exchanging clicks at less than a 1–1 ratio so that the excess can be sold) or monthly fees. However, this explanation does not seem satisfactory. A participant who seeks traffic for their product receives clicks only from others similarly motivated to sell their products. Since the average quality of clicks received is the same as those delivered, the average participant should lose in expectation once the exchange’s cut is removed, unless outside money enters the exchange.

It is also hard to believe that cash-out rates of $0.30 per 1,000 clicks (about $0.05 per hour of clicking) could be a long-term incentive for participants. The emphasis on affiliate programs and related tools and services among the exchange ads points to a different explanation. These ads appear targeted at an unsophisticated user group lured by the prospect of easy money and a career in “Internet marketing.” This description may well be representative of a large fraction of the actual manual exchange users. In this case, the sites advertising on the exchanges might be receiving quality traffic for their offers with acceptable conversion rates, even if they buy traffic from the exchange rather than clicking.

#### 7.5 Revenue Estimates
Table 6 gives the prices at which we bought clicks from various exchanges. The cost per thousand (CPM) ranges from $0.06 at Otohits to $10 at HitSafari. Obviously, the clicks are not all of the same quality, and some may suit far better than others for a particular purpose. For comparison, we computed the cost of generating clicks if one rented the cheapest instance of a virtual machine from a cloud hosting service. A micro-instance from Amazon AWS costs $0.013 per hour; setting such a machine to click twice per minute would cost $0.013 × 1000/(2 × 60) ≈ $0.11 per thousand. Of course, these clicks would offer no IP address dispersion. However, these clicks can be dispersed by using the free service of one of the autosurf exchanges. Thus, we calculate that dispersed clicks can be produced at about $0.11 per thousand. If one needed the customization that the premium services offer, then at 2.9AC≈ $3.5 per month, the cost becomes $ (0.013×24×30+3.5)×1000/(30×24×60×2) ≈ $0.15 per thousand (i.e., renting the instance for a month at the hourly rate plus the cost of premium exchange membership). Note that this is significantly lower than several of the auto exchanges charge; e.g., HitLeap charges $0.44 and Jingling $0.41 per thousand. The fact that dispersed customized clicks can be produced at significantly lower cost than the exchanges charge suggests an inefficient market. It could be that the exchanges price optimistically and sell very little at the advertised rates, or it could be that there are unsophisticated buyers for whom the task of setting up an AWS instance represents a barrier. Note that the manual exchanges ask more than 10× more per click. A possible explanation is that proposed in Sections 7.2 and 7.4: it is the participants themselves rather than an ad network who are the targets, and sending Ponzi and get-rich-quick schemes at this population is more profitable on a per-click basis than sending inorganic traffic to YouTube. Our measurements (and the requirement to perform a CAPTCHA between clicks) suggest that a large fraction of traffic on the manual exchanges is in fact organic.

It is hard to pin down definitive stable numbers for how much one can expect to earn from inorganic traffic. Some URL shortening sites post their current payout rates: adf.ly pays $3.96, adfoc.us pays $5.50, and sh.st pays $4.03 per thousand. YouTube does not post payout rates, and discussion forums seem to indicate it is a complex function of channel subscribers and number of “likes” that a video receives; between $0.50 and $4 per thousand appears to be a commonly mentioned range. (The need for “likes” and subscribers to help monetize views suggests a market for those commodities also).

If clicks can be produced at $0.15 per thousand (or bought at the rates shown in Table 6) and sold for $4 or so per thousand to URL shortening services, the opportunity is very profitable. At the two clicks per minute rate, this would produce $ (4.03 − 0.15) × 30 × 24 × 60 × 2/1000 ≈ $335.2 profit per machine per month. It seems very likely, however, that URL shortening services detect (and refuse to credit) a large volume of inorganic traffic (e.g., in its TOU, adf.ly forbids publishers from “advertising their adf.ly URL links directly on any form of traffic exchange/PTC website,” and other services use similar wording). Equally, even the lower of YouTube payout rates would appear profitable if detection has negligible effect. Ethical considerations prevent us from sending automated traffic to any of these services to probe their detection rates.

It is thus difficult to estimate the true return on inorganic traffic. We note, however, that even if only 5% of the inorganic traffic is credited (≈ $17 per machine per month), the ability to scale up by adding more machines would still allow healthy returns. Table 9 gives our estimate of the number of impressions per day from each of the autosurf exchanges. Again, we caution that the fraction of exchange traffic that is detected (and thus not credited) is unknown. Nonetheless, it is interesting to get rough ideas of the economic damage inorganic traffic might be causing. HitLeap, at 150M impressions per day, would cost $66K per day to advertisers if all exchange participants managed to monetize at $0.44 per thousand impressions (i.e., the rate the exchange charges for clicks as shown in Table 6). Similarly, the figures for eBesucher and Jingling would be $3,230 and $323K, respectively. These can be considered somewhat loose upper bounds.

### 8. Conclusion
We examined several manual and automated traffic exchange services, which enable the dispersion of traffic origins. We found that these exchanges range across three orders of magnitude in diversity of IP addresses and impressions served per day and appear to differ significantly in the monetization strategies of participants. Our results shed light on a previously poorly understood part of the traffic and ad-fraud ecosystem.
