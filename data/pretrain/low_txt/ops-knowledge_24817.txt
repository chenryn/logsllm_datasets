### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:09:06 to 18:09:11 on October 18, documents a series of issues related to resource management and lease renewal in a Hadoop environment. The key points are as follows:

1. **RM Communication Errors**:
   - At 18:09:06, 18:09:08, 18:09:10, and 18:09:11, the `RMCommunicator Allocator` (part of `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerAllocator`) encountered errors while attempting to contact the Resource Manager (RM). Each error is logged with the message "ERROR IN CONTACTING RM."

2. **Address Changes**:
   - Multiple address changes were detected for both the RM and the `LeaseRenewer`:
     - For the RM, the address changed from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030` at 18:09:07, 18:09:09, and 18:09:11.
     - For the `LeaseRenewer`, the address changed from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000` at 18:09:06, 18:09:07, 18:09:08, 18:09:09, and 18:09:10.

3. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` (part of `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer`) failed to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` multiple times:
     - At 18:09:06, it failed after 249 seconds.
     - At 18:09:07, it failed after 250 seconds.
     - At 18:09:08, it failed after 251 seconds.
     - At 18:09:09, it failed after 252 seconds.
     - At 18:09:10, it failed after 253 seconds.
     - At 18:09:11, it failed after 254 seconds.
   - Each failure is followed by a message indicating that a retry will be attempted shortly.

4. **Retry Attempts**:
   - At 18:09:08 and 18:09:10, the `RMCommunicator Allocator` logged an informational message about retrying the connection to the server `msra-sa-41:8030`. The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between each attempt.

### Conclusion
The log indicates ongoing issues with both the Resource Manager communication and the lease renewal process. The system is detecting address changes and failing to renew the lease, leading to repeated retry attempts. These issues suggest potential network instability or configuration problems that need to be addressed to ensure the stability and reliability of the Hadoop cluster.
