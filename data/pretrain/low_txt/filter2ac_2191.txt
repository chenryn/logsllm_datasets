**ATT&CK ID:** T1070.008  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Clear Mailbox Data

Adversaries may attempt to modify or delete mailbox data and related application logs to remove evidence of their activities. Email applications often provide functionality that allows users and other programs to export and delete mailbox data through command-line tools or APIs. This data can include emails, email metadata, and logs generated by the application or the operating system, such as records of export requests.

### Key Points:
- **Objective:** Remove traces of adversary activity.
- **Methods:**
  - Use of command-line tools.
  - Utilization of application programming interfaces (APIs).
- **Data Types Affected:**
  - Emails.
  - Email metadata.
  - Application and system logs, including export request logs.

By clearing this data, adversaries can make it more difficult for incident responders and forensic analysts to detect and investigate their actions.
