### § 4 Q4: Real Application
In this section, we utilize the dataset from the ISIC 2018 challenge [18] and adopt a competition-winning model (with ResNet as its backbone), which achieved second place in the challenge. The confusion matrix in Figure 18 illustrates the performance of the classifier in our study.

### § 5 Q1: Random Class Interpretation
Figure 21 visualizes attribution maps of target and adversarial (ADV2) inputs on DenseNet, complementing the results shown in Figure 12. Figure 22 compares the L1 measures and IoU scores of adversarial maps with respect to benign and target cases on DenseNet.
