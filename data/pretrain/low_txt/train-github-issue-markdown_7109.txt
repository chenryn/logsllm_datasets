# Bug Report

## Description of the Bug
The index page, when implemented within a subdirectory, exhibits different behavior between development and production modes. In development mode, everything functions as expected. However, in production mode (using `next build` and `next start`), the event listeners on the page do not fire.

## Steps to Reproduce
I have created a minimal example that reproduces this issue. You can find it here: [https://github.com/hoffrocket/next8bug](https://github.com/hoffrocket/next8bug)

## Expected Behavior
The behavior in production mode should match that of the development mode. Specifically, the event listeners should be triggered as they are in the development environment.

## System Information
- **Operating System:** macOS
- **Browsers:** Chrome, Safari
- **Version of Next.js:** 8.0.1
- **Version of Node.js:** 8.14.0
