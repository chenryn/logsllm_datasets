**ATT&CK ID:** T1137.003  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Outlook Forms

Adversaries may exploit Microsoft Outlook forms to achieve persistence on a compromised system. Outlook forms serve as templates for defining the presentation and functionality of Outlook messages. By creating custom Outlook forms, adversaries can embed malicious code that executes when a specially crafted email, utilizing the same custom form, is received by the target. This technique allows the adversary to maintain access and execute arbitrary code whenever the user interacts with the malicious email.
