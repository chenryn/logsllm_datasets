### 4.2 Lasso Regression versus the Centroid Heuristic

**Figure 5 and Table 1** demonstrate that the machine learning approach only slightly outperforms the centroid heuristic. **Figure 7** shows the cumulative distribution function of the absolute distance errors across different approaches. The dashed line represents the 90th percentile of the absolute distance errors.

### 4.3 Dormitory Determination

UC Santa Cruz (UCSC) dorms are organized into colleges, with each college located in a different region of the campus. In this third experiment, we assume that the majority of the yaks (anonymous posts) originate from these campus dorms. Our goal is to predict the specific college from which a yak originated. Specifically, we posted nine yaks from the center of each of nine colleges on the UCSC campus. For each yak, we collected presence information from 120 probes and predicted the location using the centroid heuristic. We then determined the college that sent the yak as the one closest to the predicted location.

**Figure 8** illustrates the actual and predicted locations for each of the nine yaks emanating from the centers of the nine colleges at UCSC. A black dot represents the true location, while the corresponding red dot represents our centroid prediction. As shown in **Figure 8**, in each case, the predicted college matched the actual college that made the post. Thus, in this experiment, the methodology achieved 100% accuracy in predicting the college of origin.

**Example Usage Case:**
Suppose a professor is teaching a class with 20 students, and one student makes a derogatory yak about the professor. The professor can use the methodology described in this paper to determine the college from which the derogatory post came. If the professor also has access to student housing information, they can identify the students in their class who live in the identified college. If only one student from the class lives in the identified college, the professor can determine with a high level of certainty which student made the derogatory remark on Yik Yak.

### 5. PRIVACY ENHANCEMENT

Location-based services, including Yik Yak, employ user-centric proximity, showing users all messages in their vicinity. This feature is at the core of localization attacks—when a user changes their physical location, the app displays a different set of messages. To defend against such attacks, Yik Yak could potentially use obfuscation techniques. For example, when Alice makes a request, Yik Yak could draw a binary random variable \(X_i\) for each message in a region centered around Alice. If \(X_i = 1\), the service displays the message; if \(X_i = 0\), it does not. This approach would preserve the integrity of the Yik Yak service by showing nearby messages, albeit a subset. However, we conjecture that such obfuscation techniques can be learned by machine learning if sufficient data is collected. This is an area for future research.

A more robust defense would be for Yik Yak to use fixed and static display regions, where each region might cover a college campus, a small city, or a district in a large city. Static regions can also be defined outside of cities and campuses, with their sizes roughly inversely proportional to population densities. When Alice uses the service within a region, she is shown all messages in that region but no others. With this redesign, the attack described in Section 3 would be thwarted—any message posted within a region (e.g., a campus) would be reported by all probes in that region and none outside it. Thus, every message, regardless of its exact location within the campus, would have the same feature vector, making the machine-learning attack ineffective.

Additionally, Yik Yak can maintain its current location-based service but monitor for localization attacks. For example, the service can impose strict limits on the number of periodic requests or the amount of traffic from each device. It can block queries from an IP subnet if it detects a large number of queries from that subnet. A workaround for this defense is to run the attack environment from many different subnets or through proxies on different subnets. Yik Yak can also detect forged GPS locations by enforcing strong location authentication using trusted software/hardware modules on mobile devices [13, 20] or by relying on wireless infrastructures such as WiFi APs [11], cellular base stations [19], and femtocells [2].

Finally, users can take precautions to prevent de-anonymization when using Yik Yak. For instance, Alice could avoid posting from her dorm room and instead post from campus locations she infrequently visits. While this precaution can help maintain anonymity, it may reduce the enjoyment of the service.

### 6. RELATED WORK

For people-nearby and dating services, there is prior work on determining user locations for services that report either exact distances [14, 17, 18] or band distances [5, 10]. To the best of our knowledge, the closest work to ours is [25], which provides a methodology for localizing Whisper users within 0.2 miles based on triangulation attacks. Whisper reports the distances between users and message origins, facilitating triangulation. Localizing Yik Yak users is more challenging because Yik Yak neither reports exact distances nor distance bands. Instead, it simply indicates which users are nearby without showing specific distances, and the algorithm Yik Yak uses to decide which messages to display is unknown. This paper extends a poster paper [15].

### 7. CONCLUSION

We demonstrated that the popular anonymous social media application Yik Yak is susceptible to localization attacks, putting user anonymity at risk. We provided a comprehensive data collection and supervised learning methodology that does not require reverse engineering of the Yik Yak protocol, is fully automated, and can be remotely run from anywhere. We applied the measurement and machine learning methodologies to Yik Yak at two US campuses, accurately predicting the locations of messages with a small average error of 106 meters. We also conducted an experiment where each message originated from one of nine dorm colleges on the University of California Santa Cruz campus. In this experiment, we correctly determined the dorm college that generated each message 100% of the time. Finally, we described how Yik Yak can be modified to enhance the anonymity of its service.

Although our experiments and defenses focused on Yik Yak, our results are applicable to many mobile applications that rely on geolocation for "messages-generated-nearby" services or people-nearby services, such as Badoo, Grindr, and WeChat. These apps face potential localization attacks. Even if developers attempt to obfuscate by adding randomness, geo-location can still be maliciously learned by the methodology proposed in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to consider the problem of de-anonymizing users in the popular Yik Yak application. We hope our study will inform developers working on the next generation of anonymous mobile applications.
