### Introduction
**SensePost**  
**Speakers:** Roelof Temmingh & Haroon Meer  
**Objective of the Presentation:**
- To provide an overview of the evolution and current state of trojan technology.
- To highlight the challenges and potential defenses against such threats.

### Why Trojans?
- **Profile of Trojan Users:**
  - Real criminals often do not write buffer overflows; they use more sophisticated methods.
  - The industry's approach to security can sometimes be counterintuitive.
- **Examples:**
  - Various types of trojans and their uses in real-world scenarios.

### Brief History of Trojans & Covert Channels
- **Trojans:**
  - From the quick-thinking Greeks to the quick-thinking geeks.
- **Tunnels and Covert Channels:**
  - **1985:** TSC Definition of "Covert Channels"
  - **1996:** Phrack Magazine – LOKI
  - **1998:** RWWWShell – THC
  - **1999:** HTTPTUNNEL – GNU
  - **2000:** FireThru

### Conventional Trojans & How They Fail
- **Stateful Firewall & IDS:**
  - Direct model
  - Direct model with network tricks (e.g., ICMP tunneling, ACK tunneling)
  - Properly configured stateful firewall
  - IRC agents + Authentication proxy
  - HTTP tunnel ++ Personal firewall & Advanced Proxy
  - HTTP tunnel with Authentication +++

### Hybrid Model: "GatSlag"
- **Combination between covert tunnel and trojan.**
- **Defenses Mechanisms Today:**
  - Packet filters (stateful) / NAT
  - Authentication proxies
  - Intrusion detection systems
  - Personal firewalls
  - Content/protocol checking
  - Biometrics/Token Pads/One-time passwords
  - Encryption

### A Typical Network
- **How GatSlag Worked:**
  - Reverse connection
  - HTTP covert tunnel
  - Microsoft Internet Explorer as transport
  - Controls IE via OLE
  - Encapsulate in IE, not HTTP
  - Receive commands in the title of a web page
  - Receive encoded data as plain text in the body of a web page
  - Send data with POST request
  - Send alive signals with GET request

### Why GatSlag Worked
- **Integration with MS Proxy:**
  - NTLM authentication
  - SSL capable
  - Registry changes
  - Personal firewalls
  - Just another browser
  - Platform independent
  - IE on every desktop
- **Specify Controller:**
  - Via public web page – the MASTER site

### Problems with GatSlag
- **Controller’s IP can be obtained!**
- **Handling multiple instances:**
  - GUI support
  - Controller needed to be online
  - Batch commands
  - Command history
  - Multiple controllers
  - Inefficient upload facility
  - Platform support
  - Stability
  - Session level tunneling

### Design Notes
- **Web Site Contains Instructions:**
  - CGIs to create new instructions
  - Controller’s interface:
    - EXEC (DOS commands, various)
    - TX (File upload)
    - RX (File download)
  - Directory structure for each instance
  - Trojan "surfs" to the web site just as a normal user would

### Setiri: Advances in Trojan Technology II
- **Anonymity:**
  - **Problems with Normal Proxies:**
    - Already using a proxy
    - Proxy logs
  - **"Cleaners" Provide Anonymity:**
    - "In-browser proxy" – Anonymizer
    - Trojan -> Cleaner: SSL
    - Cleaner -> Controller: SSL
- **Challenges:**
  - Browser history
  - Temporary files

### Why Defenses Fail
- **Firewalls (stateful/NAT):**
  - Configured to allow user or proxy out
- **Content Level & IDS:**
  - Looks like valid HTTP requests & replies
  - Files downloaded as text in web pages
  - No data or ports to lock onto
  - SSL provides encryption
- **Personal Firewalls:**
  - IE is a valid application
  - Configured to allow browsing
- **Authentication Proxies:**
  - User surfs the web

### Demonstration
- **Solving the Dilemma:**
  - Delivery
  - White listing
  - User education
  - AV, personal firewalls
  - Should you allow everyone to surf the 'net?

### Conclusion
- **Awareness:**
  - The importance of understanding and mitigating the risks associated with trojans and covert channels.
- **Our Motivation:**
  - To contribute to the ongoing efforts in cybersecurity and to help organizations better protect themselves.
