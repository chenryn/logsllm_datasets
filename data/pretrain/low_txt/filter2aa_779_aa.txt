#### Safety and Statistics
Elevators are incredibly safe when used properly. Consider the following statistics:
- New York City alone has almost 60,000 elevators.
- There are 11 billion trips per year, with 30 million trips every day.
- Annually, there are only about 24 injuries requiring medical attention.
- Across the nation, an average of just 26 people die in a given year while riding elevators, and the vast majority of these are trained professionals working on the devices at the time.

**Warning: Dying is Not Good. Damage is Not Good. We’re Professionals.**

#### Elevator Security (How It’s Attempted)
- **Disabled Hall Call Buttons**
- **No Hall Call Buttons**
- **Keycard to Register Hall Call**
- **Floor Cutouts** (Note: Floor cutouts are not code-compliant!)
- **Badge Systems**
- **Physically Securing the Elevator Area**

**Think of Elevators like Stairwells… but Sometimes Even Worse.**

#### Elevator Security (How It’s Subverted)
- **When There Are No Hall Call Buttons**
- **Key Switches**
  - Welcome to the Kingdom of Keys!
