## 1. Introduction
In today's rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape, organizations must adopt a proactive approach to defend against Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). This document outlines the importance of building proactive APT defense capabilities, including popular countermeasures, the evolution of incident handling, and the challenges faced by traditional methods.

## 2. Popular Cyber Attack Countermeasures
- **Password Login**

## 3. Evolution of Cyber Incident Handling
The evolution of cyber incident handling has seen a shift from reactive to proactive approaches. Traditional methods often focus on post-incident response, while modern strategies emphasize early detection and prevention.

## 4. Traditional Incident Handling Challenges
- **High Volume of False Alarms**
- **Categorization and Prioritization of Alarms**
- **Overwhelming Workloads for Staff**
- **Limited Time for Research and Tracking**
- **Routine Jobs vs. Proactive Measures**
- **Call-center Like Response to Incidents**
- **Solving Incoming Tickets**
- **Discovering Abnormalities**

## 5. Ideal CSIRT Resource Allocation
An ideal Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) should allocate resources to:
- **Digital Forensics (Disk, Network, Memory, Remote)**
- **Incident Response**
- **Proactive Incident Handling**
- **Threat Hunting**
- **Threat Intelligence**
- **Orchestration**
- **Event Systems Integration**
- **Automated Orchestration and Playbooks**
