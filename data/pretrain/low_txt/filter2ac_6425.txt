### Title: Function Identification and Recovery Signature Tool (FIRST) at Botconf 2016

Reverse engineering both benign and malicious samples can be a time-consuming process, especially given the constant emergence of new samples. Tools like IDA Pro, while powerful, often require analysts to repeatedly examine similar routines across multiple samples throughout their careers. This repetition does not easily facilitate the transfer of knowledge, either to other functions within the same sample or to similar functions in different samples.

One significant challenge in reverse engineering is the issue of code reuse, whether through statically-linked libraries or the integration of existing software. This problem can complicate the analysis process and hinder the sharing of insights.

In this presentation, we introduce a new tool called FIRST (Function Identification and Recovery Signature Tool). FIRST is designed to address these challenges by enabling the transfer of knowledge to similar functions, thereby reducing analysis time and promoting information sharing among reverse engineers.
