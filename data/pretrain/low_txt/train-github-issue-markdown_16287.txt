I am currently working on implementing the Bootstrap modal feature, but I have encountered a minor issue when toggling the modal on. This problem is also present in the Bootstrap 3 documentation, which can be found at: <http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals>.

When you click the button to open the modal, you will notice that the background shifts approximately 1 cm to the left. I have tested this on the latest versions of Safari and Chrome.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.
