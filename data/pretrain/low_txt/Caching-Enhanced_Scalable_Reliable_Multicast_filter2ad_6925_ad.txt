### CESRM: A Scalable Reliable Multicast Protocol

#### Performance Analysis and Results

The provided data and figures illustrate the performance of CESRM (Caching-based Expedited SRM) compared to SRM (Scalable Reliable Multicast). The following sections summarize the key findings and provide a detailed analysis.

#### Packet Retransmissions

- **Figure 1** shows the number of retransmitted packets for different traces. For each trace, the number of retransmitted packets is significantly lower in CESRM compared to SRM.
  - **Trace RFV960419**: CESRM sends fewer retransmissions than SRM.
  - **Trace RFV960508**: Similar to the previous trace, CESRM outperforms SRM.
  - **Trace UCB960424**: CESRM continues to show a reduction in retransmissions.
  - **Trace WRN951128**: CESRM maintains its advantage with fewer retransmissions.
  - **Trace WRN951113**: CESRM again demonstrates a significant reduction in retransmissions.
  - **Trace WRN951211**: CESRM consistently outperforms SRM in terms of retransmissions.

#### Successful Expedited Recoveries

- **Figure 2** depicts the percentage of successful expedited recoveries for each trace. An expedited recovery is considered successful if an expedited request results in an expedited reply.
  - **Success Rate**: More than 70% of the expedited recoveries are successful for all traces, with some traces achieving up to 80% success rates.

#### Transmission Overhead

- **Figure 3** compares the transmission overhead of CESRM to that of SRM. The overhead is measured as a percentage of the total transmissions required by SRM.
  - **Retransmission Overhead**: CESRM's retransmission overhead is less than 80% of SRM's for all traces, and in 10 out of 14 traces, it is less than 60%.
  - **Control Packet Overhead**: CESRM's control packet overhead is less than 52% of SRM's for all but one trace.

#### Conclusions

In this paper, we presented CESRM, a scalable reliable multicast protocol that enhances SRM with a caching-based expedited recovery scheme. CESRM leverages packet loss locality to reduce overhead and improve recovery time. Trace-driven simulations demonstrated that CESRM reduces the average recovery time of SRM by approximately 50% without introducing additional packet overhead. In fact, CESRM consistently reduced the total number of packet retransmissions and the overhead associated with control packets.

CESRM's expedited requests and replies are similar to those in router-assisted protocols, but CESRM can be deployed over IP multicast without special router support. We also introduced a router-assisted version of CESRM that utilizes intelligent router capabilities to limit the exposure of packet retransmissions. This version is more lightweight than other router-assisted protocols like LMS and can continue to recover packets even during group reconfiguration.
