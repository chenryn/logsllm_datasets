### Manufacturing Time for New Equipment

For submarine cables, in addition to the availability of equipment, accessing the failure location for repairs is also a significant challenge.

### Interdependence of Power Grids and the Internet

Modeling the interdependence between power grids and the Internet, as well as the potential for cascading failures due to their coupling, is essential. Designing recovery mechanisms for these mutually dependent systems is crucial for enhancing the robustness of our critical infrastructure.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we demonstrate that a powerful solar superstorm has the potential to cause massive disruption to the Internet. Astrophysicists estimate the likelihood of a solar storm of sufficient strength to cause catastrophic disruption within the next decade to be 1.6 × 10^-12%. Addressing this threat and planning defenses, as outlined in this preliminary effort, is critical for the long-term resilience of the Internet. Several challenges remain:

- How can we model infrastructure failures more accurately?
- How do we factor in solar threats during the design of Internet infrastructure and systems?
- How can we assist operators in making disaster preparation and recovery plans?

We anticipate that this paper will provide an initial impetus towards answering these important questions.

### Economic Impact of Disruptions

The economic impact of a one-day Internet disruption in the United States is estimated to be $7 billion [1], while the same duration of electric grid failure is estimated to exceed $40 billion [60]. The power grid is the most critical infrastructure, upon which almost all other systems depend. The impact of solar superstorms on power grids has been an active area of research for several decades [20, 40, 41, 43, 55].
