### ANNEX: IST Work Programme 2005-2006, p. 22-23

#### 2.4.7 Semantic-based Knowledge and Content Systems

**Objectives:**
- Develop semantic-based and context-aware systems to acquire, organize, personalize, share, and use knowledge embedded in web and multimedia content.
- Maximize automation of the knowledge lifecycle and achieve semantic interoperability between heterogeneous information resources and services across content types and natural languages.
- Pioneer intelligent content that is self-describing, adaptive to context and user information needs, and seamlessly interacts with its surroundings and the user.

**Focus:**

1. **Knowledge Acquisition and Modelling:**
   - Capture knowledge from raw information and multimedia content in webs and other distributed repositories to turn poorly structured information into machine-processable knowledge.
   - **Foundational Research**: Formal models and languages for representing static and dynamic knowledge, and developing the methodological and technical base of interoperable ontologies for semantic webs in diverse sectors (e.g., manufacturing, e-business, science, or geo-spatial information).
   - **Component-level Research**: Methods and tools for higher levels of information harvesting, including automated knowledge discovery, metadata extraction, annotation, summarization, concept-based and contextual retrieval of all types of digital content, with attention to cross-media and cross-lingual aspects.
   - **Priority**: Open architectures or alternative approaches ensuring seamless interworking between components and their integration within complete systems.
   - **Instruments**: IPs, NoEs, STREPs

2. **Knowledge Sharing and Use:**
   - Combine semantically enriched information with context to provide actionable meaning, applying inferencing and reasoning for decision support and collaborative use of trusted knowledge between organizations.
   - **Foundational Research**: Semantics of evolving processes and computational models for context of use.
   - **Component- and System-level Research**: Technologies enabling semantic-based collaboration services and processes, leading to scalable platforms to manage, search, share, personalize, present, and exploit complex knowledge spaces that cross organizational or community boundaries.
   - **Overall Aim**: Develop powerful and flexible solutions portable across key application domains in industry, trade, science, and society.
   - **Instruments**: IPs, NoEs, STREPs, SSAs

3. **Exploring and Bringing to Maturity the Intelligent Content Vision:**
   - Multimedia objects integrate basic content with metadata and knowledge about users and contexts, learning to react to different stimuli and proactively interact with agents, devices, and networks, and with each other.
   - **Foundational Research**: Creation, management, rendering, exchange, and trading of such objects, with due consideration to user control and content protection.
   - **Component-level Research**: Proof-of-concept methods and tools for creating, aggregating, and communicating such objects within a unifying framework supporting different content types across heterogeneous platforms and networks.
   - **System-level Work**: Metadata-based systems and processes aimed at realizing content adaptable to different users and formats, enhancing both effectiveness and flexibility.
   - **Instruments**: IPs, STREPs, SSAs

**RTD Work:**
- Address issues such as modeling user information behaviors and hiding complexity from non-expert users.
- Promote cross-fertilization between approaches and disciplines, open architectures, and coherent stacks of standards.
- Build shared infrastructures for research, training, and technology evaluation.
- Demonstrate successful integration of component technologies into robust, high-performance, and scalable systems in representative domains, readily transferable to other knowledge-intensive sectors.
- **Instruments**: IPs (all stages of research), STREPs (foundational and component-level research and discrete solutions for particular domains), NoEs (longer-term, cross-disciplinary research related to knowledge representation and reasoning or understanding of non-textual information), SSAs (case studies, best practices, drivers, and inhibitors for the deployment of new technologies by early adopters).

**Indicative Budget:**
- IPs, NoEs: 70%
- STREPs, SSAs: 30%

**Call Information:**
- **IST Call 4**

### Regular Columns

#### In This Issue:
- **Semantic Search Technology Technologies by Dr. Peter Alesso**
  - **Author**: H. Peter Alesso, PI:EMAIL, Computer Science Department, Ohlone College, CA
  - **Books**:
    - "Building Semantic Web Services," A.K. Peters Ltd., 2004.
    - "The Intelligent Wireless Web," Addison-Wesley, Dec. 2001.
    - "e-Video: Producing Internet Video as Broadband Technologies Converge," Addison-Wesley, July 2000.
  - **Software Publications**:
    - "Wealth Insurance," Compton's NewMedia, Inc., 1989.
    - "Engineering Design," VSL, 1994.
    - "Semantic Web Author," A. K. Peters, Ltd., 2004.
  - **Column Description**:
    - **Scope**: Articles and news covering explanations, examples, and advances in emerging semantic search applications, including semantic search technology, latent semantic indexing, ontology matching, semantic search agents, and semantic data clustering. Also, current development, algorithms, inference applications, and development software tools.
    - **Description**: Current commercial search technologies are based on human-directed and automated search. Human-directed search engines use keyword concepts and references, while automated search engines use Web crawlers. Semantic search engines aim to find documents with similar concepts, not just similar words, but face performance challenges with large semantic networks.
    - **Audience**: Web service developers, website developers, semantic web specialists, and search technology researchers.
  - **Swoogle: A Semantic Web Search Engine**:
    - **Overview**: Swoogle is a crawler-based indexing and retrieval system for Semantic Web documents in RDF or OWL, developed by the University of Maryland Baltimore County. It extracts metadata and computes relations between documents, facilitating the development of the Semantic Web.
    - **Architecture**: Consists of SWD discovery, metadata creation, data analysis, and interface components. The architecture is data-centric and extensible.
    - **Finding SWDs**: Uses heuristics and Google Web Service to discover potential SWDs.
    - **Relations among SWDs**: Focuses on SWD level relations, generalizing RDF node level relations.
    - **Ranking SWDs**: Uses an algorithm inspired by Googleâ€™s PageRank, classifying inter-SWD links into four categories: imports, uses-term, extends, and asserts.
    - **Indexing and Retrieving SWDs**: Applies IR techniques to both structured and unstructured components of documents, supporting popular document types like FOAF files and RSS files.
