### Period of Congestion and Its Impact on Jitter Signatures

Periods of congestion tend to affect jitter signatures. We observed a negative correlation between the increase in Round-Trip Time (RTT) values during periods of congestion and the visibility of changes in jitter signatures. This reduction in the contrast of RTT latency values between periods of elevated latency and other periods is likely related to the size of router buffers. We speculate that modern recommendations for smaller buffer sizes [5] will likely impact jitter time series.

### Contribution of Other Random Components to RTT Latency

The contribution of other random components to RTT latency can reveal congestion dynamics. Some traces contain random contributions that mask queueing delay fluctuations in the jitter time series during periods of elevated latency. Although this is not a widespread phenomenon, it could compromise Jitterbug’s ability to infer congestion, especially when using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test method.

### Limitations of Change Point Detection Methodologies

None of the change point detection algorithms we examined could identify all change points in the minimum time series in our data. RTT latency measurements exhibit a wide variety of signal profiles, including periods of elevated latency with flat, smooth, and spiky signatures. We hypothesize that change point detection algorithms may not be able to capture change points for all types of signatures in this large set of profiles. Accurately identifying all periods of elevated latency is crucial since the accuracy of Jitterbug's congestion inferences relies heavily on detecting these intervals.

### Computational Cost of Change Point Detection

The Bayesian Change Point (BCP) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) methods required significant time to execute on the 15-day traces we analyzed, typically between 60 and 90 seconds. Optimizing the performance of these methods will be critical for operational utility.

### KS-Test Method for Congestion Inference

The KS-test method captures only a limited type of congestion event signature. However, it is a simple and clean congestion inference approach, cost-effective for many scenarios beyond those we studied, and can inform further research in this area.

### Related Work

#### Inferring Network Congestion with RTT Measurements

Previous research efforts focused on interdomain congestion inference by leveraging recurrent periods of elevated latency [12,23]. These works used CAIDA’s Ark [1] to run RTT latency measurements to all visible IP-level interconnection links [24]. The Time Series Latency Probes (TSLP) [12,23] resulted from these latency measurement campaigns. An autocorrelation method was applied to TSLP data to find multi-day repetitions of elevated delays, driven by diurnal demand. However, this method requires some level of manual inspection. Fontugne et al. [15] proposed a latency-based methodology to detect congestion in last-mile access networks using RIPE Atlas probes to run traceroute measurements and infer congestion by detecting latency deviations.

#### Anomaly Detection on Network Paths

RTT time series have also been used to detect a wide range of network events, such as path anomalies [13,14] and route changes [17,30].

#### Change Point Detection

Change Point Detection algorithms aim to detect abrupt changes in a sequence of observations (e.g., a time series) to divide a sequence into a finite number of non-overlapping partitions [3]. These algorithms are typically based on mathematical or machine learning models [3,4,11,31,36]. A study found that some unsupervised anomaly detection tools for change point detection are notably time-consuming [32]. Although these methods are effective in capturing change points in the time series [9], event classification still requires human inspection.

#### Mathematical Approaches for Congestion Detection

Some studies have used sophisticated mathematical and statistical concepts to investigate congestion events. Mouchet et al. [27] proposed using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to identify different states in RTT latency time series, but these states correspond to different latency values and do not discriminate between events caused by different types of events (e.g., route change vs. congestion event). More recently, Spang et al. [34] proposed using A/B tests in TCP lab measurements to generate unbiased evaluations of TCP Congestion Control Algorithms (CCA). However, the applicability of this approach relies on the assumption of independent traffic flows, which in practice may be compromised by the synchronization of TCP flows and short-lived TCP transfers. Engineers typically use more pragmatic evaluations to test the impact of their changes.

### Open Challenges

Other approaches not covered in this paper may be useful for extracting information embedded in jitter signals. Early in this project, we proposed and tested at least four different approaches to jitter-based congestion inference. One aimed to capture jitter variability at the beginning of a period, another applied the same concept as the KS-test method but using j-min (definition in Sect. 3.1), a third used anomaly detection techniques to detect changes in jitter volatility, and the fourth used parametric models, including Normal and Levy-Stable distributions, to fit jitter behavior. These alternative approaches are promising and warrant further exploration.

In the future, we expect fluctuations of queueing delay to become more challenging to distinguish in RTT latency measurements due to smaller router buffers following modern buffer sizing recommendations [5,16]. Jitterbug's central assumption is that a period of congestion is a period of elevated latency. If latency signatures show imperceptible queueing delays, this may compromise the accuracy of change point detection algorithms. Additionally, the rise of delay-sensitive real-time applications (e.g., videocalls, online gaming) could incentivize the reduction of router buffer sizes. We observed a correlation between jitter signatures and buffer sizes and recognize that smaller buffer sizes could impede Jitterbug congestion inferences.

More demanding requirements of jitter-sensitive applications (e.g., live video streaming) could also modify traffic patterns and latency signatures. Today’s HTTP-based video delivery relies on playback modulation to mitigate jitter impact on video flow [28,29]. However, in the future, real-time video broadcasting may require shorter playback jitters and dedicated traffic engineering strategies, potentially modifying the shape of the jitter curve and thus Jitterbug inferences.

Foreseeable changes in the foundational protocols of the TCP/IP stack could modify traffic dynamics and the nature of latency signatures. New latency-based Congestion Control Algorithms could modify latency signatures and buffer occupancy. The rollout of QUIC [8,18,22,33] could spread new features in the network, reshaping the nature of traffic dynamics. For example, QUIC proposes to aggregate and multiplex multiple short-lived web data transfers—typically run in parallel per-resource TCP sessions [8]—into a single transport-layer protocol session.

We expect that future work from ML/AI communities will develop more cost-effective change point detection tools. The growing necessity of monitoring large-scale time series databases to generate (near) real-time anomaly detection is likely to drive optimization in this space [32]. We anticipate that in the coming years, we will see more rapid and optimized supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms to detect change points.

### Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we proposed Jitterbug, a novel framework to infer network congestion by combining pre-existing approaches with information embedded in jitter signals. We found that jitter allowed us to expand congestion inference beyond scenarios of recurrent congestion patterns, such as one-time congestion events. Jitter (and jitter-derived signals) time series are useful for discriminating periods of elevated latency caused by congestion from route changes.

We have also learned about the various challenges of inferring network congestion with RTT latency measurements. The vastly heterogeneous structure of the network is reflected in diverse latency signatures showing large and small buffer sizes, and the presence of randomness unrelated to congestion events. We have also learned about the limitations of change point detection algorithms in detecting all beginning and ending points of periods of elevated latency, as well as the time required to obtain results from these algorithms.

Applying Jitterbug to the cases in our dataset, we obtained similar results to recent autocorrelation methods [12]. However, in contrast to that method, which is based on the repetitiveness of the signal and uses information from near- and far-side RTT latency measurements, Jitterbug is fully based on far-side RTT latency measurements and does not rely on repetitiveness to discern the congestion status of a period.

We hope that this work will encourage further studies on network congestion inference, jitter analysis, and change point detection algorithms. In the future, we would like to investigate how sampling rates (higher and lower) affect congestion inferences and profiles of RTT latency signatures. We are also interested in studying whether purely jitter-based congestion inference methods can be developed. Another topic we would like to explore is if inter-packet delay in back-to-back measurements, for example using the FAST probing tool [26], could allow us to infer congestion.
