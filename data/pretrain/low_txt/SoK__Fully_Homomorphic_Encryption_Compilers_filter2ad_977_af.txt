### Conclusion

It is important to note that our analysis and discussion have focused exclusively on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) tools. However, real-world problems are often complex and may require a combination of techniques, including FHE, Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). In the long term, the secure computation community could benefit significantly by addressing these problems more holistically and developing tools that support a wider range of cryptographic techniques.

### Acknowledgments

We extend our gratitude to our shepherd, the anonymous reviewers, and Kenny Paterson for their valuable feedback. We also thank the FHE tool developers and maintainers for making their code available, as well as the CHET/EVA and SEALion developers for their assistance and for providing us with access to their tools. This work was partially supported by the SNSF Ambizione Grant No. 186050.
