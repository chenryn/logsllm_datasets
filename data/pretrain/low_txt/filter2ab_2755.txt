**ATT&CK ID:** T1609  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Container Administration Command

Adversaries may exploit container administration services to execute commands within a container. Common examples of such services include the Docker daemon, the Kubernetes API server, and the kubelet. These services are designed to enable remote management of containers in an environment, but they can also be misused by attackers to gain unauthorized access and execute malicious commands.
