#### 17A: Multiomic Data Integration Using Machine Learning and Data-Driven Inverse Metabolic Modelling
**Time:** 1:30 p.m. – 2:00 p.m.
**Presenting Author:** Wolfram Weckwerth, University of Vienna, Austria

**Abstract:**
We present an integrated proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and metabolomics platform that serves as the foundation for the Vienna Metabolomics Center (VIME) (https://metabolomics.univie.ac.at/). Our data mining strategy is based on the COVAIN (COVAriance INverse) toolbox, which facilitates data processing, integration, multivariate statistical analysis, machine learning, and data-driven inverse metabolic modelling [1]. This integrative workflow has been applied to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [2] and the analysis of mTOR-dependent immune system modulation [3]. 

Activation of immune cells involves a reconfiguration of cellular energy metabolism, including shifts in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, which critically regulate functional effector responses. However, current mass spectrometry strategies often fail to comprehensively identify the checkpoint nodes and enzymes responsible for different metabolic outputs. We demonstrate that a data-driven inverse modelling approach from mass spectrometry metabolomics data can be used to identify causal biochemical nodes that influence overall metabolic profiles and reactions. Using multi-omics analysis, including metabolomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics, and enzymatic activity measurements, we identified metabolic signatures of energy signaling and macrophage differentiation.

The presented concept of multi-omics analysis, machine learning, and data-driven inverse modelling allows for systematic integration of genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, prediction, and analysis of causal biochemical regulation in microbes, plants, animals, and humans, as well as their interactions.

#### 17B: Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Sebum Contents for Classification of Parkinson’s Disease
**Time:** 2:00 p.m. – 2:20 p.m.
**Presenting Author:** Drupad Trivedi, University of Manchester, United Kingdom
**Co-Authors:** Eleanor Sinclair, Depanjan Sarkar, Joy Milne, Monty Silverdale, Tilo Kunath, Roy Goodacre, Perdita Barran

**Abstract:**
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting the aging population, with approximately 1 in every 350 adults diagnosed in the UK. Currently, there are no definitive diagnostic tests for early-stage PD. This research aims to develop an early diagnostic method using biomarkers in sebum, which is known to have a distinct odor in PD patients.

Sebum swabs were collected from the upper back of 276 participants, including PD patients on medication (n=139), drug-naive PD patients (n=81), and controls (n=56) across 28 NHS sites in the UK. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for the separation and detection of metabolites extracted from sebum samples. After pre-processing, 700 features were analyzed using machine learning techniques, including support vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF).

The metabolome achieved classification accuracy using SVM and RF. Pathway enrichment analysis showed significant enrichment (p < 0.05) in primary bile acid biosynthesis, sphingolipid metabolism, D-arginine and D-ornithine metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism. These results indicate a significant shift in the endogenous metabolome in PD, reflected in lipid-like molecules captured in skin sebum.

#### 17C: Mechanistic Model-Driven Exometabolomic Characterisation of Human Dopaminergic Neuronal Metabolism
**Time:** 2:20 p.m. – 2:35 p.m.
**Presenting Author:** Ronan Fleming, Leiden University, Netherlands
**Co-Authors:** Jennifer Modamio, Can Gulersonmez, Fatima L. Monteiro, Diana El Assal, Edinson L. Moreno, Miguel A.P. Oliveira, Cornelius C.W. Willacey, Laurent Heirendt, Zhi Zhang, Ben Cousins, Hulda S. Haraldsdóttir, Susanne Zach, Averina Nicolae, Siham Hachi, Amy Harms, Santosh Vempala, Bastian Hengerer, Jens C. Schwamborn, Ines Thiele, Enrico Glaab, Thomas Hankemeier, Ronan M.T. Fleming, German Andres Preciat Gonzalez

**Abstract:**
Patient-derived cellular models are a powerful tool for studying human diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson’s Disease (PD), where affected primary neurons, such as substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, are almost inaccessible. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived models of midbrain-specific dopaminergic neurons are increasingly used to investigate PD.

Starting with the comprehensive generic reconstruction of human metabolism, Recon3D, we generated the first constraint-based, genome-scale, in silico model of human dopaminergic neuronal metabolism (iNESC2DN). Transcriptomic data, obtained by RNA sequencing, and quantitative exometabolomic data, obtained by targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, were generated for in vitro neuroepithelial stem cell-derived cultures. These data were supplemented by extensive manual curation of the literature on dopaminergic neurons.

The predictions of the iNESC2DN model are consistent with neurobiochemical prior information and in concordance with measured fluxes of uptake and secretion of many extracellular metabolites by dopaminergic neurons in vitro. We leverage this model to rank order the most important metabolite concentrations to quantify, thereby reducing the uncertainty associated with current predictions of normal dopaminergic neuronal metabolism in vitro. Additionally, the iNESC2DN model provides a foundation for future targeted metabolomic and tracer-based metabolomic analyses of dopaminergic neurons, illustrating the synergy between constraint-based computational modelling of metabolism and biology-driven quantitative bioanalytical chemistry.

#### 17D: Interleaving Metabolic Effects of Sleep and Aging
**Time:** 2:35 p.m. – 2:55 p.m.
**Presenting Author:** Arjun Sengupta, University of Pennsylvania, United States
**Co-Authors:** Jennifer Choi Tudor, Joseph Baur, Ted Abel, Aalim Weljie

**Abstract:**
Decreased sleep is a hallmark of modern society, influenced by both environmental and biological factors. Sleep deprivation (SD) has been linked to life-threatening complications, including neurodegenerative diseases and cardiometabolic disorders. The role of metabolic disruption in the physiological effects of SD is emerging but not fully understood. The interaction between SD and aging phenotypes is also unclear.

In this study, we used a mouse model of 5-hour acute sleep deprivation in young adult (2-4 months) and aged (20-22 months) mice to capture metabolic shifts. Numerous metabolites were perturbed post-SD in young (24, 61, 53 metabolites in hippocampi, liver, and plasma, respectively) and aged animals (17, 42, 38 metabolites). Young animals demonstrated greater metabolic susceptibility post-acute SD than aged animals. Specific SD metabolites in young animals (5, 19, 15 metabolites in hippocampi, plasma, and liver, respectively) recapitulated a portion of the aging signature, suggesting that SD makes "young seem old."

Hepatic signatures of ketosis were common to both groups, with greater prominence in young animals. Altered hepatic NAD metabolism and urea cycle were also common signatures of SD. The choline and acetylcholine pool in the young animals was specifically depleted in the hippocampi, potentially linking metabolism to SD-induced alterations in memory consolidation. These results form a foundation for understanding the systemic metabolic effects of sleep deprivation and aging.

#### 17E: Analysis of Changes in the Eye Lens and Aqueous Humor Under Cataract Development Using Quantitative Metabolomics
**Time:** 2:55 p.m. – 3:10 p.m.
**Presenting Author:** Vadim Yanshole, ITC SB RAS / NSU, Russian Federation
**Co-Authors:** Lyudmila Yanshole, Olga Snytnikova, Yuri Tsentalovich

**Abstract:**
Cataracts, characterized by the clouding of the eye lens, are a common cause of vision impairment in older people. The protection of the lens is primarily provided by metabolites, which are synthesized in the lens epithelium or enter the lens through the epithelial layer from the surrounding aqueous humor (AH). Therefore, changes in the metabolome of the lens and AH may help establish the molecular mechanisms of cataract onset.

Quantitative metabolomic profiles of eye tissue extracts (lens, AH) were obtained using a combination of high-frequency 1H NMR and ion-pairing HPLC with optical (LC-OD) and high-resolution ESI-q-TOF MS detection (LC-MS). The concentrations of more than 80 metabolites were determined for four groups of samples: lenses and AH from cataract patients and lenses and AH from human cadavers.

Our metabolomic data confirm the hypothesis that although age-related cataracts usually manifest as opacification of the lens nucleus, the initial site of cataract onset might be the lens epithelial layer. Important metabolites for lens protection, such as antioxidants, UV filters, and osmolytes, are synthesized in the lens epithelial cells. Reduced levels of these metabolites were found in cataractous lenses, indicating that cataract development may originate from the dysfunction of the lens epithelial cells. The increase in the concentrations of other metabolites in non-cataractous post-mortem tissues corresponds to post-mortem processes.

### SESSION 18: FOOD APPLICATIONS 2
**Wednesday, June 26, 1:30 p.m. – 3:15 p.m.**

#### 18A: Session Keynote - Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometry for Detecting Compounds Related to Consumer Liking of Meat
**Time:** 1:30 p.m. – 2:00 p.m.
**Presenting Author:** Alastair Ross, AgResearch, New Zealand
**Co-Authors:** Paul Middlewood, Stefan Clerens, Patricia L Johnson, Arvind Subbaraj, Patrick Silcock, Graham T Eyres, Carolina E Realini

**Abstract:**
Unbiased measurement of chemical components related to consumer liking is crucial for continuous improvement in breeding and meat processing for higher eating quality meat products. Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (REIMS) is a mass spectrometry interface initially developed for surgery that allows real-time analysis of samples and is well-suited for rapid analysis of meat.

We hypothesized that within the metabolic signature of meat obtained using REIMS, it would be possible to detect compounds related to consumer liking. In a pilot study, 150 lambs were randomly selected from 10 different commercial mobs (n=15/group), and a 2 x 2 x 1 cm loin sample (Longissimus lumborum) was collected for REIMS analysis. REIMS analysis was carried out in triplicate on 149 available samples in both positive and negative ionization modes over two days.

Associations between consumer panel data (n=160 panellists) and REIMS fingerprints were performed using PLS and OPLS-DA modeling, and confirmed using Pearson correlation and ANOVA. Meat with the highest overall liking scores was higher in compounds associated with aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and breakdown, while meat with lower overall liking scores was associated with a higher proportion of phospholipids. Using REIMS, it was possible to detect compounds related to consumer liking of meat. In the future, this approach could complement grading systems for identifying and predicting meat cuts with characteristics that maximize eating quality and aid consumer-driven breeding programs.

#### 18B: Fiber Mix Supplementation in Wheat-Based Flatbreads Delays the Exogenous Appearance of Glucose and Its Downstream Metabolites
**Time:** 2:00 p.m. – 2:20 p.m.
**Presenting Author:** Lisa Schlicker, BRICS, TU Braunschweig, Germany
**Co-Authors:** Lisa Schlicker, Hanny M. Boers, Christian-Alexander Dudek, Gang Zhao, Jean-Pierre Trezzi, Doris M. Jacobs, Karsten Hiller

**Abstract:**
In nutritional intervention studies, the use of fully isotopically enriched plant material instead of single compound tracers enables deep insights into the postprandial catabolism of plant components (e.g., starch or protein). Due to limited availability, only marginal amounts can be included, resulting in labeled plasma metabolites with 13C enrichment below natural enrichment of 1.1%, making accurate quantification analytically challenging.

We developed an optimized mass spectrometry-based analytical workflow to achieve accurate quantification of 13C-enrichment in selected plasma metabolites below 1%. This workflow was applied to plasma samples from a nutritional intervention study investigating the postprandial effects of fiber supplementation in wheat-based flatbreads. In this crossover study, 12 healthy male subjects consumed flatbreads of different compositions: wheat flour (control) and wheat flour supplemented with 15% chickpea flour and different amounts of guar gum (2%: GG2, 4%: GG4).

We obtained time-resolved 13C enrichment profiles of 12 plasma metabolites, including glucose, lactate, alanine, glycine, serine, citrate, glutamate, glutamine, valine, isoleucine, tyrosine, and threonine. While the postprandial metabolome was only mildly affected, fiber mix supplementation significantly impacted the postprandial appearance of food-derived metabolites in the blood. Most interestingly, fiber supplementation decreased the exogenous appearance of glucose and its downstream metabolites, lactate and alanine. These data highlight the limitations of metabolite profiling and demonstrate that in vivo labeling contributes to a better understanding of nutritional interventions.

#### 18C: A Metabolomic Approach to the Identification and Validation of Biomarkers of Apple Intake
**Time:** 2:20 p.m. – 2:35 p.m.
**Presenting Author:** Aoife McNamara, Institute of Food and Health, Ireland
**Co-Authors:** Helena Gibbons, Diana Gonzalez-Pena, Breige McNulty, Lorraine Brennan

**Abstract:**
The potential of individual food-intake biomarkers to objectively measure diet is a research area of interest. Improvements in dietary assessment are necessary to elucidate diet/health associations. The objective of this study was to identify novel biomarkers of apple intake and explore their potential to determine intake.

Twenty volunteers consumed 360g of apples as part of an acute feeding study. Postprandial urine samples were collected at 2, 4, and 24 hours post-apple consumption for analysis. A dose-response study was then performed, where volunteers consumed different portions of apples (50g, 100g, or 300g), and fasting urine samples were collected for analysis. Xylose was quantified using a 600-MHz Varian NMR spectrometer with the first increment of a NOESY pulse sequence.

Dose-response data were used to develop calibration curves to determine apple intake in an independent free-living cohort (n=565) and classify individuals into categories of apple intake. Multivariate analysis of NMR metabolomic data and time-series plots revealed that urinary xylose concentrations increased significantly at 4 hours post-apple consumption (2.19uM/osm), compared to the control food, broccoli (0.34uM/osm). In the dose-response study, urinary xylose concentrations demonstrated a linear increase as apple intake increased (r=0.406; p<0.0001). Urinary xylose concentrations quantified in the free-living cohort (0.05 to 1.46mM) showed strong agreement between biomarker-based intake classification and self-reported intake classification. Xylose performed well as a ranking biomarker for grouping into apple intake categories. Future work will combine xylose with other markers to determine intake at an individual level.

#### 18D: Brainfood Metabolomics Study (Icebreaker, Brave Sub-Study)
**Time:** 2:35 p.m. – 2:55 p.m.
**Presenting Author:** Kati Hanhineva, Afekta Technologies Ltd., Finland
**Co-Authors:** Marika Laaksonen, Sanna-Maria Hongisto, Juhani Sibakov, Heli Diaz, Anton Mattsson, Ville Koistinen, Jussi Loponen

**Abstract:**
Cognitive performance is related to glucose metabolism and metabolic activation, which are regulated by dietary factors. We studied the effects of a brain-friendly diet (Brainfood) on metabolic and physiological parameters and cognitive performance in office workers at assumed metabolic risk (Brave study).

We conducted a diet-switch, 4-week intervention study on 84 volunteers with elevated plasma LDL levels in pre-screening. The Brainfood diet focused on regular meal frequency and optimal intake of polyunsaturated fats, fiber, and salt, whereas the control diet was a typical Western diet. Plasma samples were collected at the end of the lead-in, control, and intervention periods and analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC–QTOF-MS). Intervention efficacy was determined with a linear mixed model, and the fold changes of the metabolite levels were tested with t-tests corrected with Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR).

In total, we identified 37 differential metabolites (FDR-corrected p < 0.05), including acylcarnitines, amino acids, choline, 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionic acid (CMPF), methylimidazoleacetic acid, monoacylglycerols, phospholipids, piperine, and retinol. Several phosphatidylcholines and plasmalogens containing polyunsaturated fatty acids increased after the Brainfood diet, whereas lipids containing saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids decreased. The individual variability in metabolites was larger compared to the intervention effect.

Conclusions: The Brainfood diet increased levels of CMPF and polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids, likely originating from the intake of fatty fish. The reduced consumption of animal fats decreased their corresponding fatty acids in the lipid profile. Increased 3-methylhistidine was observed as a potential marker of poultry and plant-based protein intake.

#### 18E: Mass Spectrometry-Based Non-Targeted Metabolomics Enables the Identification of Amadori Products in Feces of Formula-Fed Infants
**Time:** 2:55 p.m. – 3:10 p.m.
**Presenting Author:** Alesia Walker, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Research Unit Analytical BioGeochemistry, Germany
**Co-Authors:** Nina Sillner, Daniel Hemmler, Monika Bazanella, Silke S. Heinzmann, Dirk Haller, Philippe Schmitt-Kopplin

**Abstract:**
Non-targeted metabolomics can be used to identify food markers without prior focusing on a set of small molecule ingredients or known food metabolites. Our interest was to investigate fecal metabolite profiles of breast- and formula-fed infants during the first year of life using LC-MS/MS and a subset by FT-ICR-MS.

We observed that fecal samples of one-month-old infants fed with whey-based formula milk were dominated by four m/z values assigned as nitrogen-containing compounds (C18H34N2O8, C24H44N2O13, C12H24N2O7, and C18H34N2O12) analyzed by FT-ICR-MS. HMDB annotation using m/z values resulted in one putative matching of fructosyllysine (FruLys), which is one of the most abundant Amadori products derived from food. Identification of four putative Amadori products was done with HILIC LC-MS/MS. Fragmentation experiments showed loss of a dipeptide for two features and multiple losses of water for all features, typical for glucose/lactose moieties. The dipeptide fragment was assigned to leucylisoleucine (LeuIle), which is present at the N-terminal sequence of the major whey protein β-lactoglobulin. The other two fragmented features showed typical lysine fragments. Based on the fragmentation, we identified two LeuIle and two Lys Amadori products (FruLeuIle, LactulosylLeuIle, FruLys, and LactulosylLys). Three of them were synthesized, fractionated, and characterized by NMR, while FruLys was available as an authentic chemical standard. All compounds were not detected in breastfed children, and fecal levels of Amadori products decreased over time in formula-fed children due to solid food introduction. Thus, LeuIle Amadori compounds could serve as food markers for the consumption of whey-based formula milk.

### SESSION 19: DATA INTEGRATION & DATA BASING 2
**Wednesday, June 26, 1:30 p.m. – 3:15 p.m.**

#### 19A: Session Keynote - The UniProt, Rhea, and SwissLipids Knowledge Resources for Metabolomics and Lipidomics
**Time:** 1:30 p.m. – 2:00 p.m.
**Presenting Author:** Alan Bridge, Swiss-Prot group, SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Switzerland
**Co-Authors:** Anne Morgat, Thierry Lombardot, Robin Liechti, Teresa Batista Neto, Sebastien Gehant, Parit Bansal, Jerven Bolleman, Kristian Axelsen, Lucila Aimo, Nevila Hyka-Nouspikel, Lou Götz, Dmitry Kuznetsov, Anne Gleizes, Anne Niknejad, Elisabeth Coudert, F Gisou van der Goot, Howard Riezman, Nicole Redaschi

**Abstract:**
Our group specializes in the development and maintenance of expert-curated knowledge resources for the life sciences. Here, we describe recent work designed to improve the utility of these knowledge resources for integrated computational and experimental analyses of metabolic systems. Our starting point for this work is Rhea (www.rhea-db.org), a comprehensive expert-curated knowledgebase of over 11,500 biochemical reactions that uses the ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) ontology of small molecules to describe reaction participants, their chemical structures, and chemical transformations.

We recently introduced Rhea as the standard for the annotation of enzymatic reactions in the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB, at www.uniprot.org). UniProtKB is a reference resource of protein sequences and functional annotation that currently includes over 150 million sequences and thousands of proteomes from all branches of the tree of life. The introduction of Rhea will significantly enhance the utility of UniProtKB as a basis to integrate and analyze metabolomic, proteomic, and genomic data, generate and annotate metabolic networks and models, mine reaction data for pathway prediction and metabolic engineering, and map metabolites to human diseases and associated genes and variants.

We will describe selected tools and services that leverage Rhea and UniProt and practical examples of how to use them. We will conclude by describing how we use curated knowledge of lipid metabolic pathways in Rhea and cheminformatics approaches to build SwissLipids (www.swisslipids.org), a resource of over 500,000 known and theoretically possible lipid structures and biological knowledge that is fully mapped to ChEBI, Rhea, and UniProt.

#### 19B: RIKEN Plant Metabolome MetaDatabase: An Integrated Plant Metabolome Data Repository Based on the Semantic Web
**Time:** 2:00 p.m. – 2:20 p.m.
**Presenting Author:** Atsushi Fukushima, RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science, Japan
**Co-Authors:** Mikiko Takahashi, Nozomu Sakurai, Toshiaki Tokimatsu, Hideki Nagasaki, Hideki Hirakawa, Takeshi Ara, Makoto Kobayashi, Miyako Kusano, Kazuki Saito, Masanori Arita, Norio Kobayashi

**Abstract:**
Metabolome data provide new opportunities to gain a deeper understanding of plant metabolism relevant to both plant and human health benefits. Major public repositories for general metabolome data have been launched over the past decade, but many aspects remain unresolved, especially for improving reanalysis, reusability, and reproducibility. In this study, we developed the RIKEN Plant Metabolome MetaDatabase (RIKEN PMM, http://metabobank.riken.jp/), which stores gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based (GC-MS-based) metabolite profiling data of plants together with their detailed experimental metadata, including sampling and experimental procedures.

Our metadata are described using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and standardized vocabularies, such as the Metabolomics Standardization Initiative Application Ontology (MSI-AO), to integrate with other life and biomedical science data on the World Wide Web. The RIKEN PMM implements intuitive and interactive operations for plant metabolome data, including raw data, mass spectra, and metabolite annotations. The RIKEN PMM is suitable not only for scientists interested in metabolomic phenotypes but also for researchers who would like to investigate plant metabolomics approaches. Our framework can provide enough metadata required for reanalyzing and reusing the raw data and will contribute to the development of yet another general-purpose metabolomics repository.

#### 19C: Contextualizing Metabolomics Data by Integrating Text Mining and Machine Learning
**Time:** 2:20 p.m. – 2:35 p.m.
**Presenting Author:** Magnus Palmblad, Leiden University Medical Center, Netherlands

**Abstract:**
The scientific literature contains a wealth of information for text mining and machine learning in the public domain, including Europe PMC with 35 million titles and abstracts and 2.3 million open access papers. Much work has been done on extracting functional protein interactions and linking genes to diseases. Here, I will describe how text mining chemical entities, with emphasis on metabolites, can be combined with machine learning and large-scale prediction of physicochemical properties to guide the selection of analytical methods in metabolomics, assess bias in metabolomics datasets, and place metabolomics data in wider contexts.

The method is automated in scientific workflows, greatly facilitating its reuse and adaptation. Particular emphasis is placed on how to visualize the results from millions of named-entity recognitions in tens of thousands of articles in a single, informative figure. The visualization styles may be new in the text mining but should be intuitive to practitioners of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Applications include drug development, data integration, and business intelligence.
