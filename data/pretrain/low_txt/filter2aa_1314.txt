### The Cavalry Year[0]: A Path Forward for Public Safety

#### Authors: Joshua Corman and Nicholas J. Percoco

**Introduction:**
Our dependence on technology is growing faster than our ability to secure it. As we struggle to protect our organizations, connected technologies are now pervasive in every aspect of our livesâ€”from our cars and homes to our bodies and public infrastructure.

**Mission:**
To ensure that technologies with the potential to impact public safety and human life are trustworthy and secure.

**Approach:**
1. **Collecting:** Gather existing research and researchers to achieve critical mass.
2. **Connecting:** Facilitate connections between researchers and stakeholders in media, policy, legal, and affected industries.
3. **Collaborating:** Work across a broad range of backgrounds and skill sets.
4. **Catalyzing:** Accelerate research and corrective efforts to address issues more quickly than they would be addressed otherwise.

**Key Message:**
- The cavalry isn't coming; it falls to us.
- We must be ambassadors of our profession.
- We must be the voice of technical literacy.
- We must research what truly matters.
- We must amplify our efforts.
- We must escape the echo chamber.
- We must team up with each other.

**Year[0] Activities:**
- Research
- Conferences
- Government Engagement
- Industry Collaboration
- Media Outreach
- Deliverables

**What Worked Well:**
- **The Mission:** The problem statement, instinct, and timing were right. While similar efforts had been attempted before, the timing was crucial.
- **Collecting, Connecting, Collaborating, Catalyzing:** Teamwork and collective knowledge proved immediately useful, particularly in the medical and automotive sectors.
- **It Takes a Guild:** Diverse but complementary skills made us stronger, including contributions from industry, government, and individuals less interested in public recognition.
- **Finding Members to Educate Us:** To better prepare ourselves as ambassadors and to train in professional development and soft skills.
- **Outside Interest, Feedback, New Members:** Tangible results fueled interest and commitment, creating positive feedback loops.

**What Worked Less Well:**
- **Too Much Initial Scope:** The initial scope of "Body, Mind & Soul" was narrowed to "Body," or "Public Safety & Human Life."
- **Poor Project Management:** Lack of concrete, bite-sized roles and tasks led to impatience among willing participants.
- **Poor Balance:** Discrete progress versus external communication. The void was often filled with false information and avoidable friction/opposition.

**Surprises:**
- **Soft Skills:** Early on, it became clear that we needed to develop skills in communication, empathy, and professional media training. These skills also enhanced our effectiveness in our day jobs.
- **Public Policy:** We found unexpected allies in congressional staffers who were more savvy than anticipated.
- **Industry Reception:** Affected industries had people ready for help, who proved to be valuable guides and assets.
- **The Mission:** Mainstream media and policymakers found the mission clear and compelling, leading to increased buy-in and new avenues of support.
