## DNS Overview
- **Definition:**
  - The Domain Name System (DNS) maps hostnames to IP addresses.
  - More generally, it maps (key, type) tuples to a set of unordered values, acting as a multi-value distributed key-value store.

- **Clients, Caches, and Content Servers:**
  - Clients request full resolution service from caches.
  - Caches make zero or more inquiries to DNS content servers on behalf of clients, caching results for a limited time to serve future requests.
  - Content nameservers serve DNS records for zones that have been delegated to them.

- **DNS Caching Resolvers:**
  - Diagram illustrating the interactions between clients, caches, and content servers.

- **Client-Server and Inter-Server Protocols:**
  - The DNS uses two different protocols with a common wire format:
    - Client-to-server protocol between clients and caches.
    - Inter-server protocol between caches and content servers.
  - Passive DNS focuses on the inter-server protocol.

## Passive DNS
- **Definition:**
  - Invented in 2004 by Florian Weimer.
  - Used for various purposes, including malware detection, e-crime, and legitimate internet services.
  - Captures inter-server DNS messages, which are then processed and stored in a database.

- **Deployments:**
  - Florian Weimer’s original dnslogger at RUS-CERT and BFK.de (2004–).
  - Bojan Zdrnja’s dnsparse (2006–).
  - ISC’s Security Information Exchange (SIE) (2007–).

- **ISC Security Information Exchange (SIE):**
  - A distribution network for different types of security data.
  - Uses NMSG format to encapsulate data.
  - Data is broadcast onto private VLANs.
  - Features include support for passive DNS data storage.
  - For more information, see the Google Tech Talk: [http://www.isc.org/community/presentations/video](http://www.isc.org/community/presentations/video).

## DNS Security Issues
- **Kashpureff Poisoning:**
  - A type of DNS cache poisoning where an attacker runs a content nameserver.
  - A client is enticed to look up a domain name under the attacker’s control.
  - The cache contacts the attacker’s nameserver, which provides extra records that are inserted into the cache.
  - Example: `malicious.example.com. IN A ?` and `malicious.example.com. IN NS www.example.net.`

- **Kaminsky Poisoning:**
  - Discovered in 2008 by Dan Kaminsky.
  - Exploits the lack of entropy in UDP DNS queries, making it possible to bypass the TTL.
  - Coordinated patches introduced source port randomization (SPR) to mitigate this issue.

- **Relevance to Passive DNS:**
  - Both Kashpureff and Kaminsky poisoning have analogues in passive DNS.
  - Passive DNS sensors cannot see the DNS cache’s "bailiwick," leading to record injection.
  - Spoofed responses are treated like normal responses, potentially poisoning the passive DNS database.
  - Goal: Make passive DNS at least as reliable as active DNS.

## Protecting the Capture Stage Against Response Spoofing
- **Capture both queries and responses.**
- **Correlate responses with previously seen queries.**
- **Use the DNS message 9-tuple:**
  1. Initiator IP address
  2. Initiator port
  3. Target IP address
  4. Target port
  5. Internet protocol
  6. DNS ID
  7. Query name
  8. Query type
  9. Query class

This structure and content should provide a clear, coherent, and professional overview of the topic.
