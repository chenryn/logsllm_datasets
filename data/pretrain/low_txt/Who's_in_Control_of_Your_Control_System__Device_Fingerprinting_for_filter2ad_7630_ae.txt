### Mitigating Structural Model Errors and Enhancing Physical Fingerprinting

**Introduction to Gray Box Modeling:**
The most effective method to mitigate structural model errors is to adopt a gray box modeling approach. This approach integrates the predictive capabilities of white box models with the empirical data from black box models, thereby enhancing the overall accuracy and robustness of the system.

**Forgery Attempts and Detection:**

- **Forgery Attempt for Physical Fingerprinting Under Strong Adversary (Fig. 25b)**

**Forgery Detection:**

- **Forgery Detection for Weak Adversary (Fig. 26a)**
- **Forgery Detection for Strong Adversary (Fig. 26b)**

A more knowledgeable and skilled adversary would need to have prior knowledge of the relative speed of their machine compared to the target's, understand the network architecture's impact on the signature, and determine the rate at which the target's clock drifts. These requirements suggest that the proposed methods are robust enough to be integrated into a comprehensive defense-in-depth Intrusion Detection System (IDS) strategy.

**Enhancing Defenses Against Mimicry Attacks:**

Although the fingerprinting techniques proposed here are completely passive and do not require any changes to the target network or devices, better defenses against mimicry attacks could be implemented if this assumption is relaxed. For example, the SCADA master or the fingerprinter could be configured to send random, non-functional requests or commands. This would increase the complexity of the behavior the adversary must mimic. For the CLRT method, this could involve varying the number of specific measurements polled each time, which should theoretically result in measurable timing differences. For the physical fingerprinting method, redundant commands could be sent, such as sending a "Close" command when the breaker is already closed.

**Limitations:**

While both proposed fingerprinting methods perform well under certain conditions, there are some limitations. The cross-layer fingerprinting method requires a SCADA protocol using "Read" and "Response" messages, which all popular SCADA protocols implement. Additionally, the SCADA protocol must operate over a TCP implementation that uses a minimum amount of "quick ACKs" (immediately acknowledging packets instead of delaying). 

To improve accuracy, synthetic samples can be replaced with measured samples in the response distribution. Over time, the accuracy would converge to that of a black box model. It is important to note that, due to the accuracy limitations of white box modeling, this approach is best suited for scenarios where equipment is used infrequently, making it difficult to immediately obtain sufficient black box data. White box modeling, however, serves as a valuable tool by providing an initial estimate of the response distribution that can be updated opportunistically as additional data is gathered.

**Conclusions and Future Work:**

In this paper, we presented two novel methods for passively fingerprinting devices on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) networks. After evaluating these methods using real-world datasets and controlled lab experiments, we achieved classification accuracies of up to 99% and 92% for the first and second methods, respectively. Both techniques demonstrated resistance to simple forgery attacks and could be feasibly implemented alongside traditional IDS solutions to enhance the security of critical ICS networks.

For future work, we plan to improve the white box modeling and extend these methods to fingerprinting embedded devices in the "Internet of Things." We also intend to investigate the possibility of developing active fingerprinting techniques to further increase classification accuracy.

**Appendix:**

**A. Software Configuration Fingerprinting:**

To verify the suggestions from the large-scale experiments that the software configuration was observable through CLRT measurements, lab experiments were performed on the same exact IED with different settings enabled and disabled. Approximately 700 CLRT measurements were taken for each of three cases: all extra settings enabled, only overcurrent protection enabled, and all extra settings disabled. When comparing the distributions for all extra settings enabled versus disabled in Figure 27, there are several noticeable differences. In fact, when the same FF-ANN from the previous experiments was trained on these two cases, perfect classification accuracy was achieved. Figure 28 shows only minor differences between the 'free' case and the overcurrent case, and consequently, the FF-ANN only achieves roughly 66% classification accuracy.

**B. Modeling of a Vacuum Interrupter:**

The previous example in Section V highlights the modeling process for a small-scale relay for which laboratory data can be easily obtained. To demonstrate how this methodology scales to common ICS devices, the physical modeling approach is applied to a medium voltage vacuum circuit-breaker commonly found in power distribution stations. Vacuum interrupters typically employ contacts located inside a vacuum tube (used to mitigate arcing during operation). The breaker itself is a mechanical device operated by a preloaded spring so that opening and closing of the breaker happens rapidly. A picture of the Siemens GMSG vacuum circuit breaker and a mechanical schematic of the relevant moving parts are shown in Figure 29.

**Simulated Open and Close Response Distributions for Vacuum Interrupter (Fig. 30):**

The purpose of the above example is not to provide a detailed mathematical analysis of a vacuum interrupter, but rather to demonstrate that a high-fidelity dynamic model of a real-world ICS component can be developed without requiring access to or operation of the device itself. Instead, available technical drawings and manufacturer's specifications are sufficient in many cases to estimate model parameters and generate a reasonable prediction of the device's response time distribution.
