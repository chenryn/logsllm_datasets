# Best Practices for Querying and Visualizing Azure Data Explorer Data with Power BI

Azure Data Explorer is a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data. [Power BI](/power-bi/) is a business analytics solution that allows you to visualize your data and share the results across your organization. To import data into Power BI, see [Import a Query from Azure Data Explorer into Power BI](power-bi-data-connector.md) or use a [SQL Query](power-bi-sql-query.md). This article provides tips for querying and visualizing your Azure Data Explorer data with Power BI.

## Best Practices for Using Power BI

When working with terabytes of fresh raw data, follow these guidelines to ensure that your Power BI dashboards and reports are responsive and up-to-date:

### Travel Light
- **Bring only the necessary data** to Power BI. For deep, interactive analysis, use the [Azure Data Explorer web UI](web-query-data.md), which is optimized for ad-hoc exploration with the Kusto Query Language (KQL).

### Composite Model
- Use the [composite model](/power-bi/desktop-composite-models) to combine aggregated data for top-level dashboards with filtered operational raw data. Clearly define when to use raw data and when to use an aggregated view.

### Import Mode vs. DirectQuery Mode
- **Import Mode**: Use this for smaller datasets that require frequent interaction.
- **DirectQuery Mode**: Use this for large, frequently updated datasets. For example:
  - Create dimension tables in **Import Mode** as they are small and do not change often.
  - Set the refresh interval according to the expected rate of data updates.
  - Create fact tables in **DirectQuery Mode** as they are large and contain raw data.
  - Use Power BI [drillthrough](/power-bi/desktop-drillthrough) to present filtered data.
  - When using **DirectQuery**, leverage [Query Reduction](/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-directquery-about#report-design-guidance) to prevent reports from loading data prematurely.

### Parallelism
- **Increase parallelism** to improve dashboard rendering performance:
  - Increase the number of [concurrent connections in DirectQuery in Power BI](/power-bbi/desktop-directquery-about#maximum-number-of-connections-option-for-directquery).
  - Use [weak consistency to enhance parallelism](kusto/concepts/queryconsistency.md), though this may impact the freshness of the data.

### Effective Slicers
- Use [sync slicers](/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-slicers#sync-and-use-slicers-on-other-pages) to prevent reports from loading data before you are ready. After structuring the dataset, placing all visuals, and marking all slicers, select the sync slicer to load only the required data.

### Use Filters
- Apply as many Power BI filters as possible to focus the Azure Data Explorer search on the relevant data shards.

### Efficient Visuals
- Choose the most performant visuals for your data to ensure optimal performance.
