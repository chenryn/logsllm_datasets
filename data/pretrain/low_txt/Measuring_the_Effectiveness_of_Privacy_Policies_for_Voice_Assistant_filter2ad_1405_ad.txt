**Consent and Participation:**
Participants were provided with a consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) office. Those who did not provide consent were not allowed to proceed with the study. Each participant who completed the study was rewarded $0.20.

**Participant Demographics:**
A total of 98 participants took part in our study. We included a question to ensure that the responses were authentic, and based on this, we rejected the answers of 7 participants. Thus, our results are based on the responses from 91 participants. The participants were either Amazon Alexa users or Google Assistant users; we excluded users of other voice assistants like Siri and Cortana. Our sample included 66 Alexa users and 25 Google Assistant users.

**Survey Questions and Responses:**
The survey included questions about participants' awareness and behavior regarding privacy policies. Below are the key questions and the percentage of responses:

- **Are you aware of the privacy policies of your skills/actions?**
  - Yes: 48%
  - No: 52%

- **How often do you read the privacy policy of a skill/action?**
  - Rarely: 73%
  - Half the time: 11%
  - Most of the time: 16%

- **Do you read the privacy policy from the skill/action’s webpage/Alexa app?**
  - Yes: 34%
  - No: 66%

- **Do you know what personal data the skills/actions you use are capable of collecting from you?**
  - Yes: 47%
  - No: 21%
  - Maybe: 32%

- **Do you read the privacy policy before using a new skill/action?**
  - Yes: 18%
  - No: 79%
  - Maybe: 3%

- **Do you read the privacy policy before enabling a kid’s skill/action?**
  - Yes: 75%
  - No: 7%
  - Maybe: 18%

**Discussion of Survey Results:**
Table 8 shows the survey responses. When asked about their awareness of the privacy policies of the voice apps they use, 48% of the participants claimed they were aware. However, when asked about how often they actually read the privacy policy, 73% responded "rarely," and only 11% said they read it half the time. Additionally, 34% of participants said they use the smartphone app or the skill's webpage to read the privacy policy, while 66% never read it. Furthermore, 47% were unaware of what data is being collected by the skill, and another 21% were unsure. This indicates a significant usability issue where users ignore the privacy policy even when it is provided. 

When asked about the issues they face with privacy policies, 20% of the participants found it hard to access, 44% felt the document was too long, and 24% noted inconsistencies between the privacy policy and the skill’s actual functionality. Users also reported problems with developers not providing a privacy policy at all or providing ones that were not informative. Only 14% of participants always checked the privacy policy before enabling a skill, and 79% did not check it before enabling a general skill, while 75% did not check it before enabling a kids' skill. This lack of usage of the privacy policy highlights the need for voice assistant platforms to address these concerns and improve the quality and usability of the privacy policies provided by developers.

**Limitations:**
- We were unable to examine the actual source code of voice apps, which could have provided more insight into the data practices.
- Future research could involve dynamically testing voice apps to check their data collection practices.
- Most developers provide short descriptions, but these often do not define data practices, making our findings on inconsistency checking incomplete.
- Our dataset of Google actions is not complete, as the actions are loaded dynamically, and we were unable to use a crawler to get information about all the actions.

**Why Poor-Quality Privacy Policies?**
- Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant do not explicitly require app-specific privacy policies, leading to confusion among users.
- Some privacy policies contain up to 428 data practices, most of which are not relevant to the skill.
- The certification process does not thoroughly check the content of privacy policies, resulting in inactive and broken links and policies unrelated to the skill.
- Updates to the skill may not be reflected in the privacy policy, leading to discrepancies.

**Privacy Policy Through Voice:**
- The unavailability of privacy policies through voice requires users to access them over the web or through the apps on their phones.
- We propose introducing a built-in intent that provides information about the privacy policy through a voice response, addressing the challenge of the length of the documents.

**Related Work:**
- Previous research has focused on user concerns about the security and privacy of voice assistants and technical attack vectors.
- There has been limited research on privacy policy analysis for voice apps, with most work focusing on mobile apps.

**Conclusion:**
Our comprehensive empirical analysis of 64,720 Amazon Alexa skills and 2,201 Google Assistant actions revealed a substantial number of problematic privacy policies. We also conducted a user study to understand users' perspectives, highlighting real-world frustrations. We discussed possible approaches to improve the usability of privacy policies on voice assistant platforms.
