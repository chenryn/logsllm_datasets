While reviewing the button demonstrations on the Material-UI website (http://material-ui.com), I observed that the click effect is not functioning correctly in Firefox. Interestingly, the click effect works as expected for list items, suggesting that the issue is specific to buttons in Firefox. This problem does not occur in Chrome.
