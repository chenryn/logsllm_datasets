## Abstract
We introduce a novel concept and model of image point memorability (IPM) for analyzing click-based graphical passwords, which have been extensively studied in both the security and human-computer interaction (HCI) communities. In our model, each point in an image is associated with a numeric index indicating its memorability level. This index can be approximated using either automatic computer vision algorithms or human assistance. Our model allows us to rank-order image points by their relative memorability with reasonable accuracy. We demonstrate that the IPM model has both defensive and offensive applications.

On the defensive side, we use the IPM model to generate high-quality graphical honeywords, marking the first work on honeywords for graphical passwords. On the offensive side, we develop the first successful dictionary attacks on Persuasive Cued Click Points (PCCP), the state-of-the-art click-based graphical password scheme. We show that the probability distribution of PCCP passwords is significantly biased when examined through the lens of the IPM model. Although PCCP was designed to generate random passwords, our analysis reveals that its effective password space can be as small as 30.58 bits, substantially weaker than its theoretical strength of 43 bits. The IPM model is applicable to all click-based graphical password schemes and can be extended to other graphical password systems.

## 1. Introduction
A major development in computer security over the past decade is the emergence of "usable security," which has become a thriving and fast-moving discipline. There is a consensus that security systems need to be both secure and usable.

One hot research topic in usable security is graphical passwords, which aim to provide a graphical alternative to text passwords, which have long suffered from various security and usability issues. Graphical passwords have been extensively studied in both the security and HCI communities and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. For example, Microsoft Windows 8 adopted a variant of the BDAS graphical password scheme, and Android's unlocking pattern is also a graphical password system.

The inspiration for graphical password research comes from the well-known fact that people remember pictures better than words. This picture superiority effect has been studied for decades by cognitive scientists and psychologists. However, these studies have mainly focused on the memorability of entire images.

A notable exception is the MIT team's pioneering work published in 2012, which introduced the notion of "memorability of image regions" and studied which regions of an image are memorable or forgettable.

In this paper, we study the memorability of image points to make breakthroughs in the security analyses of click-based graphical passwords, where a password is a sequence of points, referred to as click-points, on one or more images. We propose a novel model to capture and describe the memorability of each clickable point in an image. A point is the smallest measure of an image with no internal structure, while a region comprises many image points and has internal structures. Additionally, a spot is a very small portion of an image comprising points considered equivalent in click-based graphical passwords.

Our work builds on previous research showing that image points are not selected with equal chances, implying that people associate different memorability levels with different points. Our main contributions include:

1. Formulating the concept of image point memorability (Section 3).
2. Developing two methods for implementing and utilizing the IPM model: human-assisted memorability (Section 4) and automated memorability (Section 5).
3. Demonstrating both defensive and offensive applications of the IPM model (Sections 6 and 7).

### 2.1 Click-based Graphical Passwords

#### 2.1.1 Representative Schemes
While the first envisaged graphical password scheme was click-based, the most extensively studied scheme is PassPoints, where a user selects a sequence of click-points on an image to create a password. Previous studies suggested that five click-points provide a good balance of security and usability. However, PassPoints is vulnerable to attacks exploiting image hotspots and click patterns. To address these vulnerabilities, Cued Click Points (CCP) extends PassPoints by using multiple images, one click-point per image, and a deterministic function to determine the next image. Persuasive Cued Click Points (PCCP) further extends CCP by requiring users to select a click-point within a randomly positioned viewport.

#### 2.1.2 Dictionary Attacks
The security of click-based graphical passwords has been extensively studied. Golofit found that users tend to avoid flat regions, irregular structures, and periodic regular structures in selecting click-points. Dirik et al. found that click-points of user-created PassPoints passwords tend to concentrate at certain spots, i.e., image hotspots. Chiasson et al. found distinct common patterns among click-points, i.e., click patterns.

Hotspots and click patterns have been exploited to mount successful dictionary attacks on PassPoints. For example, Dirik et al. proposed an attack using a visual attention model to predict the likelihood of a centroid being a click-point, achieving a success rate of 8.45% on a representative image using a dictionary of about 31 bits. Automated dictionary attacks on PassPoints were also proposed, with the most comprehensive and sophisticated attacks reported by van Oorschot et al., achieving a success rate of 48-54% using dictionaries of approximately 35 bits built with image-independent patterns.

Human-seeded attacks on PassPoints achieved a success rate of 20-36% using dictionaries of 31 to 33 bits built with the independent probability model. Chiasson et al. examined hotspots and click patterns for PassPoints, CCP, and PCCP, concluding that PassPoints passwords contain both hotspots and click patterns, CCP passwords contain hotspots but no click patterns, and PCCP passwords contain neither hotspots nor click patterns. A later study reexamined the data and found that the click-points of PCCP passwords deviate from complete randomness, making it difficult to successfully guess a PCCP password.

An image typically has a large number of corners and centroids. Permuting all of them to form password candidates would lead to a huge dictionary that is ineffective for dictionary attacks. For PassPoints, this issue is resolved by applying click patterns and salience to select likely combinations. For PCCP, there is no pattern or correlation among click-points, leaving the challenge of mounting effective dictionary attacks.
