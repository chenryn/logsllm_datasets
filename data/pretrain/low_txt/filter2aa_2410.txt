### The Story of the Highly-Secure Enterprise

#### Network Configurations
- **Variant #1:** Endpoints with restricted Internet access
  - Software update servers (e.g., Microsoft Update)
  - Antivirus (AV) update/services
- **Variant #2:** Endpoints with no direct Internet access
  - On-premise update servers
  - On-premise AV management servers

### Introducing Cloud AV

- **Trend:** Many organizations are adopting cloud-based AV solutions.
- **Question:** What can go wrong with adding cloud AV?

### Potential Security Deterioration

- **Scenario:** Adding cloud AV to a highly secure enterprise (restricted or no direct Internet connection).
- **Risk:** Using the cloud AV to exfiltrate data from the endpoint.
- **Threat Actor:** An attacker located anywhere on the Internet.
- **Method:** Abusing the cloud AV sandbox for data exfiltration.

### Exfiltration via a Cloud AV Sandbox

#### Basic Techniques
1. **Triggering an AV Event:**
   - Writing the EICAR file to disk
   - Installing "malware" (persistence) by moving its binary under the Windows Startup folder
2. **Exfiltration from an Internet-Connected Machine:**
   - Sending HTTP/HTTPS request to the attacker’s host
   - Forcing DNS resolution

#### Attack Flow
1. **The Attacker infects the endpoint with the Rocket:**
   - The Rocket collects sensitive data and embeds it into the Satellite.
   - The Rocket writes the Satellite to disk and executes it.
2. **The Satellite triggers the AV agent:**
   - The AV agent sends the Satellite to the AV cloud service for further inspection.
3. **The AV cloud service executes the Satellite in a sandbox:**
   - The Satellite sends the collected data over the internet to the attacker.

### Insights on Cloud AV Sandboxes
- Some sandboxes (e.g., ESET) block HTTP but not DNS.
- Some sandboxes block access to environment variables.
- Non-standard software and environment variables are common.
- Cloud AV sandboxes are easily detectable through various identifiers.
- Shared sandbox infrastructure among vendors.
- Varying lead times for execution (minutes to hours).
- Multiple executions and binary extraction.

### Sample Names and Environment Variables
- **ESET:** REYNAPC, MALVAPC, ELEANOREPC, WRIGHTPC, BRIAPC, JORIPC, GABBIPC, HELSAPC, MAMEPC, SHARAIPC, ARACHONPC, FLORIANPC, EDITHPC
- **Various:** WIN7-PC, ROGER-PC, DAVID-PC, ADMIN-PC, APIARY7-PC, ANTONY-PC, LUSER-PC, PERRY-PC, KLONE_X64-PC, 0M9P60J5W-PC, MIKI-PC
- **Avira:** C02TT22, C02TT26, C02TT36, C02TT18, C06TT43
- **Comodo:** spurtive, circumstellar, ZGXTIQTG8837952
- **Others:** ABC-WIN7, PC, WIN-U9ELNVPPAD0, PC-4A095E27CB, WIN-LRG949QLD21

### Less Obvious Fingerprints
- Environment variable values can reveal timestamps and other identifying information.
- Example: `tmpH=12 tmpM=29 tmpS=16` → 12:29:16 = Now (UTC-0700)

### On-Premise AV Sandboxes
- More secure alternative to cloud AV sandboxes.
- Same attack technique may apply depending on network policies.
- Vulnerable combinations likely exist in a non-negligible portion of installations.

### Sample Sharing Considerations
- Sharing samples outside the enterprise can facilitate exfiltration.
- Examples: Security mailing lists, file/sample repositories, expert analysis services, online/cloud sandbox/scanning services.

### Exfiltration Demonstrated Possible With:
- Google VirusTotal
- Joe Security Joe Sandbox Cloud (DNS only, limited to 10 queries)
- Payload Security Hybrid Analysis

### Vendor Status
- **Cloud AV:**
  - Avira: Fixed on May 2nd (10h30m)
  - ESET: Fixed on May 15th or before
  - Comodo: Fixed on May 26th
  - Kaspersky: Provided a private fix and configuration options
- **Cloud Sandboxes:**
  - VirusTotal: Will not fix
  - Joe Security: Fixed on June 19th (3d11h)
  - Payload Security: No comment

### Suggested Improvements for Cloud AVs
- Block all traffic to the Internet from the sandbox.
- Only allow a sample to interact with the Internet if it arrives from the Internet and is byte-wise identical to the original.

### Future Research Directions
- Additional triggers and exfiltration methods (e.g., SMTP, IRC, ICMP).
- Encrypting/compressing the Satellite template.
- Simulating AV agent-cloud protocol for stealthier exfiltration.

### Conclusions
- Cloud AVs with Internet-connected sandboxes can facilitate exfiltration even from highly secure enterprises.
- In-the-cloud and on-premise sandboxes can be vulnerable.
- Sharing suspicious/malicious files can facilitate exfiltration unless the file has arrived from outside the enterprise and is unmodified.
- Online/cloud scanning/analysis services (e.g., VirusTotal) can also be exploited.
