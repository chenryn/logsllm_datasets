### 11. Conclusion

In this work, we have demonstrated that mobile applications can collect a significant amount of both static and runtime information about other apps, enabling them to create unique fingerprints. Our analysis has revealed that many third-party entities are interested in learning about the apps installed on users' devices. Furthermore, we have shown that there are currently no existing mechanisms for concealing the presence of an app from other apps. To address this issue, we have proposed HMA, the first solution designed to hide the presence of sensitive apps. HMA does not require any modifications to the Android operating system and preserves the key functionalities of the apps. The results of our evaluation and user study indicate that HMA is both usable and desirable to users.
