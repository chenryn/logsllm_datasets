## 1. Security Property Determination

The security properties of Information Technology (IT) products and systems are crucial for national security, critical infrastructure, and the economic well-being of advanced societies. These properties are studied, tested, and evaluated to provide essential information for decisions concerning trustworthiness and suitability for specific purposes. This panel will address both current and future approaches to these determinations. Following the panelists' opening statements, the moderator will pose important and thought-provoking questions and accept questions from the audience. The following questions will guide the discussion:

1. **Paradigm Shift in Process:**
   - What changes are occurring within and between the schemes described below and similar activities in other sectors?

2. **Cost-Effective Security Measures:**
   - Given that all organizations have resource limitations (e.g., skills, time, money), what are the most cost-effective activities for improving the security of IT products and systems in the normal conduct of enterprise business, critical infrastructure, and national defense?

3. **System Integration and Weakest Links:**
   - Systems involve multiple products, integrators, evaluated products, and "glueware" that melds the products into a cohesive system. Should efforts focus on the weakest links? What can be done, and how can information gained from each activity be reused?

## 2. Acquisition Communities and Security

For years, the acquisition community and the security community have struggled to align their efforts to successfully procure large systems with appropriate security properties. A major issue has been that security engineers articulate their designs using their own paradigm and language, while the acquisition community procures systems and components using a different paradigm and language. Only at the highest levels of reference have the procurement paradigm and security community language come together to attempt to acquire secure systems. Even at this level, most procurement strategies have been based on product specifications without considering the security properties of the system as a whole.

## 3. Specification of Security Properties

In principle, the specification of security properties should not differ from the specification of other system properties. Conflicts among specifications and goals are anticipated, and trade-offs will be necessary when all specifications and goals cannot be achieved. The customer will be involved in some of the decisions concerning trade-offs and will help the integrator decide how to evolve the specifications, goals, and the system itself.

The International Standard ISO/IEC 15408, also known as the Common Criteria (CC) for Information Technology Security Evaluation, provides a model for specifying and evaluating the security properties of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products and small systems. In the United States, the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), a joint project of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Security Agency (NSA), represents the CC Project. NIAP has established the Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS) to implement a CCRA-compliant evaluation scheme within the U.S.

In September 2002, NIAP held a workshop titled "Integrating Security into Large-scale Acquisitions."

## 4. Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

NIST is conducting a program mandated by the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). This program includes the security categorization of information and information systems, the selection of appropriate security controls for information systems, verification of security control effectiveness, determination of information system vulnerabilities, and operational authorization for processing (security accreditation) of information systems. The intended outcomes include more repeatable, comparable, and consistent evaluations of security controls applied to information systems; a better understanding of enterprise-wide mission risks; more complete, reliable, and trustworthy information for authorizing officials; and more secure information systems within the Federal government and the critical infrastructure of the United States.
