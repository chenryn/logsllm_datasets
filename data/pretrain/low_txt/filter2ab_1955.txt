**ATT&CK ID:** T1053.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Scheduled Task/Job - At

Adversaries may exploit the `at` utility to schedule tasks for the initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The `at` utility is available as a command-line tool in Windows, Linux, and macOS, allowing users to schedule tasks to run at a specified time and date. 

In Windows environments, the `at` utility has been deprecated in favor of the `schtasks` command, which is part of the Task Scheduler. However, if `at` is used, it requires that the Task Scheduler service be running, and the user must have administrative privileges (i.e., be a member of the local Administrators group).
