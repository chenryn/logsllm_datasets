# Encountered an Animation Error with GLTF Model

I have encountered an issue with a GLTF model that I exported from 3D Max using the Babylon.js export plugin. The animation plays correctly in both the Windows 3D Viewer and the online GLTF viewer provided by Babylon.js, but it displays incorrectly when using Three.js. It appears to be a matrix transformation error. I have attempted to resolve this issue, but I am unable to fix it. Has anyone else experienced a similar problem?
