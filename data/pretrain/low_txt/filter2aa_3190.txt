## What Makes a City "Smart"?
- **Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)**
- **Urban Automation**
- **Public Safety and Emergency Management**
- **Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)**
- **Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN)**

## Limited Citizen Privacy and Risk Management Options
- **Consumer Choices:**
  - Opt-out of smart devices (e.g., non-smart TV, feature phone, older car)
- **City-Level Choices:**
  - Can you move to a city that isn't "smart"?

## Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), OBD-III, and DSRC
- **Communication:**
  - Connected vehicles communicate with each other and with city infrastructure.
- **Privacy Concerns:**
  - The proposed OBD-III standard raises privacy and due process concerns.

## Hangzhou "City Brain"
- **Quote:**
  - "In China, people have less concern with privacy, which allows us to move faster."
  - —Xian-Sheng Hua, Manager of AI at Alibaba, World Summit AI, 2017

## Smart Streetlights with Cameras
- **Data Management:**
  - GE's Bill Ruh states that it is up to each city to set policies around the data collected by the sensors and how it can be used.

## Facial Recognition
- **Singapore:**
  - In 2017, Peter Ong, former head of Singapore’s civil service, announced plans to deploy facial recognition technology to all 110,000 lampposts in the country.

## Dubai Robotic Police Force
- **Vision:**
  - "By 2030, we will have the first smart police station which won’t require human employees."
  - —Brigadier Khalid Nasser Al Razouqi, General Director of the Smart Services Department, Dubai Police
