### Title: Black Hat USA 2022 - Breaking Firmware Trust from Pre-EFI: Exploiting Early Boot Phases

Vulnerabilities in System Management Mode (SMM) and UEFI applications/drivers (DXE) have garnered increasing attention from security researchers. Over the past nine months, the Binarly efiXplorer team has disclosed 42 high-impact vulnerabilities related to SMM and DXE firmware components. However, newer platforms have significantly enhanced runtime mitigations in the UEFI firmware execution environment, including SMM. The introduction of Intel's new platform firmware runtime mitigations, such as Intel Hardware Shield, has reshaped the attack surface for SMM and DXE, applying these protections below the operating system.

The complexity of modern platform security features continues to grow each year. These security promises are built on multiple layers, each defining its own security boundaries. Unfortunately, these layers can sometimes introduce inconsistencies in mitigation technologies, creating opportunities for attackers to exploit and break the overall security model.

In this presentation, we will share our findings on recent changes in UEFI firmware security runtime, using one of the most recent Intel CPUs as a case study. We will cover the evolution of firmware mitigations in SMM and DXE on x86-based CPUs and discuss new attacks on the Intel Platform Properties Assessment Module (PPAM), which is often used in conjunction with the Intel SMI Transfer Monitor (STM). These topics have not been previously discussed from an offensive security research perspective.
