The `flutter.yaml` file's asset support is a convenient method for including assets across both platforms. While it remains uncertain whether we intend to maintain this feature in the long term, if we do decide to keep it, it would be beneficial to add support for directories and/or file globbing. Currently, I am in the process of writing a script to update my `flutter.yaml` whenever the directory of images changes.
