#### SECRET TOOLS
**Learning About Government Surveillance Software You Can’t Ever See**
- **Presenter:** Peyton “Foofus” Engel
- **Event:** DEF CON 25

### Non-Public Technology
**Breath Analyzers: Source Code Analysis Reveals Bugs**
- These devices are used to determine whether to arrest and charge individuals.

**The Clipper Chip: NSA-Designed Encryption Device with a Built-in Backdoor**
- **Reference:** [Clipper Chip on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip)

**Trust Us: We Know What We’re Doing**
- The assurance from authorities that they have the necessary expertise and control.

### Surveillance Is Pervasive
**CALEA (Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act)**
- **Restrictions:** Prohibits the installation of un-tappable phone systems.
- **Reference:** [CALEA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act)

**NSA Call Metadata Collection**
- Traffic analysis can be as valuable as content analysis.
- **Reference:** [NSA Ends 9/11-Era Surveillance Program](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/11/29/457779757/nsa-ends-sept-11th-era-surveillance-program)

**Surveillance is Secret:**
- Most people were unaware of the extent of surveillance until Edward Snowden's disclosures.

### More Than Just Surveillance
**"Playpen" Cases Dropped Over NIT Use**
- The FBI deployed malware on a seized website to obtain IP addresses of TOR users.

**Government Exploit Code Leaks**
- **Reference:** [CIA Exploit List in Full](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/08/cia_exploit_list_in_full/)

**Boundary Between Aggressive Investigation and Rights Violation**
- The line between thorough investigation and infringing on individual rights.

### Investigating Peer-to-Peer Networks
**Gnutella, BitTorrent, Ares, etc.**
- These networks have been in use for some time (e.g., Gnutella since 2009).
- **Forks of Open-Source Software:**
  - Utilize underlying aspects of peer-to-peer protocols not typically accessible to users.
  - Add features that may not interest ordinary users.

### Who Develops These?
**Joseph Versace: Programmer/Analyst with the Ontario Provincial Police**
- **Project:** Roundup Ares, a .Net-based client for the Ares network.

**Collaboration of CS Departments at Univ. MA Amherst, Georgetown; PA and MA State Police:**
- **Projects:**
  - Roundup: Java-based fork of the Phex Gnutella client.
  - Roundup Torrential Downpour: for BitTorrent.

### New Uses for Existing Features
**Gnutella:**
- Search query hits include SHA-1 values of shared files.
- Swarming information includes IP addresses and GUIDs of systems sharing the same file.
- Direct browsing of peers.

**BitTorrent:**
- Tracker messages identify which peers are interested in which torrents.
- Peers announce what pieces of files they possess during downloads and when they acquire new segments.
- Peer Exchange: similar to swarming info for Gnutella.

### New Features
- **Known File Lists:** Database of hashes of known files of interest.
- **IP Geolocation:**
- **Single-Source Downloading:** Attempt to download all segments from a single host.
- **Anti-Feature:** Uploading is disabled.
- **Tagging Individual Systems:** Further details to follow.

### So What Do They Do?
- Impersonate regular peers.
- Engage in activities designed to attract connections.
- Perform queries to find peers sharing files of interest.
- Inspect connected systems.
- Perform single-source downloads.
- Log their activity.

### The Code Must Remain Secret #1
- **Reasons:**
  - Divulges the database of contraband.
  - Unlikely to be part of the software.
  - Disclosing would disrupt the trading of illegal materials.

### The Code Must Remain Secret #2
- **Reasons:**
  - Discloses undercover investigators.
  - Suggests a shared list of static IPs or reverse DNS to avoid targeting each other.
  - Software likely refreshes its copy of the list.
  - Logs from the software sometimes include public IPs.

### Potential Problems: Reliability
- **False Positives:** Does the software erroneously report its actions?
  - Investigators often don't find the files mentioned in warrant affidavits.
  - Warrants are executed months after downloads.
- **Malfunctions:** Are there conditions under which the software fails?

### Potential Problems: Warrants
- **Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27 (2001):** Use of FLIR system required a warrant.
  - Argument: "This is just modified open-source software; any user could do the same thing."
  - How can we ensure we are doing the same thing?
- **Tagging:** GUIDs and log files, shared vs. non-shared areas.

### Potential Problems: Testimony
- **Challenges:**
  - Evaluating the reliability of statements about IP address correlation, peer-to-peer networks, and government tools based on open-source software.
  - Who is qualified to testify about these tools in court? Requires more than just knowledge of their use.

### Potential Problems: Exploitation
- **Flaws:**
  - Inherited from components like Java, Phex, and the BitTorrent protocol.
  - Own bugs.
- **Undetected Exploitation:**
  - Lack of transparency and availability.
  - Mostly used by investigators, not security professionals.
