### Optimized Text

In this study, we examined the node sampling problem in large systems with a probabilistic approach, focusing on resilience against malicious nodes. Two online algorithms were proposed and analyzed: one is fully robust (omniscient strategy), while the other (knowledge-free strategy) is resilient with very limited memory.

#### Key Parameters and Results
- **Flooding Attack**: For a flooding attack to be successful, \( L_{k,t} = 104 \). The system is fully robust if \( L_{k,t} = 38 \).
- **Targeted Attack**: The system is robust with \( E_k = 44 \) and \( E_k = 110 \).
- **Node Identifiers**: The sampler service uses node identifiers. The probabilities 0.9 and 0.9999 are respectively noted for different scenarios.
- **Omniscient Strategy**: This strategy is robust against both attacks.
- **Knowledge-Free Strategy**: This strategy is also robust but with a smaller memory footprint.

#### Figures and Analysis
- **Figure 8**: Complements Figure 7(a) by showing the gain in Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence) between the output stream and a uniform distribution. The input stream is biased by a peak attack generated by a Zipfian distribution with \(\alpha = 4\).
- **Figure 9**: Demonstrates that both output streams (constructed using omniscient and knowledge-free strategies) quickly reach a stationary regime. The omniscient strategy requires fewer distinct elements to achieve this, while the knowledge-free strategy needs three times more.
- **Figure 10**: Illustrates the impact of the number of entries in the sampling memory on the system's defense against peak and targeted attacks. The knowledge-free strategy effectively masks these attacks with a sufficient number of entries.
- **Figure 11**: Shows the KL divergence as a function of the number of malicious node identifiers. The system becomes vulnerable when malicious nodes represent about 10% of the population.
- **Figure 12**: Compares the KL divergence between different streams (input and output) and a uniform distribution, demonstrating the effectiveness of the sampling strategies.

#### Future Work
Future work will focus on analyzing the transient behavior and lumpability in Markov chains, as described in [26] and [27].
