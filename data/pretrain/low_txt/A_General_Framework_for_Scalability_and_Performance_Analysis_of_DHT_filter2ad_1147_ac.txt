# Scalability and Resilience of DHT Routing Protocols under Random Failures

## 1. Introduction
This work introduces the Reachable Component Method (RCM), an analytical framework for evaluating the performance of Distributed Hash Table (DHT) systems under random node failures. The RCM is validated through its application to five prominent DHT routing geometries, demonstrating a strong agreement with simulation results from the literature.

## 2. Analytical Framework
The RCM provides a method to assess the routability of DHT systems, defined as the probability that a path exists between any two nodes in the presence of random failures. We analyze the scalability and robustness of various DHT routing geometries, including Tree, Hypercube, XOR, Ring, and Symphony.

### 2.1 Figures and Results

#### Figure 6: Analysis vs. Simulation
- **(a) General Comparison:**
  - Both analytical and simulation curves are shown for three routing geometries: Tree, Hypercube, and XOR.
  - The analytical curves closely match the simulation data, validating the accuracy of the RCM.
- **(b) Ring Geometry:**
  - For the ring routing algorithm, the discrepancy between analytical and simulation results is due to suboptimal hops contributing significantly to the routing process.
  - The analytical curve provides an upper bound for the percentage of failed paths, particularly accurate for failure probabilities below 20%.

#### Figure 7: Scalability and Routability
- **(a) Asymptotic Limit:**
  - Plots the percentage of failed paths for varying node failure probabilities in the asymptotic limit (N = 2^100).
  - The curves for Tree and Symphony approach a step function, indicating a sharp transition in routability.
- **(b) Routability vs. System Size:**
  - Shows the routability of different routing geometries for a constant failure probability (q = 0.1) and varying system sizes.
  - Tree and Symphony exhibit poor scalability, with routability degrading to zero as the system size increases.
  - Hypercube, Chord, and XOR remain highly routable even at very large scales.

### 2.2 Mathematical Analysis
- **Tree and Symphony:**
  - The n(h) expression for both Tree and Symphony is given by \( n(h) = 2^{h-1} \).
  - The Q(m) series for Symphony diverges, indicating that it is unscalable.
- **Hypercube:**
  - The p(h, q) expression for Hypercube is \( p(h, q) = (1 - qm) \).
  - Using Theorem 1, it is shown that the Hypercube geometry is scalable.
- **XOR:**
  - The Q(m) series for XOR involves only \( qm \) and \( mqm \) terms, making it convergent and scalable.
- **Ring:**
  - By comparing the Markov chain models of Ring and XOR, it is shown that the Ring geometry is also scalable.

## 3. Conclusions
- The RCM effectively characterizes the performance of DHT systems under random failures.
- Some DHT routing geometries, such as Tree and Symphony, are unscalable in the presence of non-zero failure probabilities.
- Others, like Hypercube, Chord, and XOR, are more robust and maintain high routability even as the system size grows.
- This analysis is crucial for designing and implementing P2P systems, especially in large and highly transient networks.
