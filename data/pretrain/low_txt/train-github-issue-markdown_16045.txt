### Debugging Output
```plaintext
$ celery -A uniweb report
software -> celery:5.2.7 (dawn-chorus) kombu:5.3.0 py:3.9.17
            billiard:3.6.4.0 redis:4.5.4
platform -> system:Linux arch:64bit
            kernel version:3.10.0-1160.88.1.el7.x86_64 imp:CPython
loader   -> celery.loaders.app.AppLoader
settings -> transport:sentinel results:redis://:**@django-cms-test-redis-headless:6379/7
```

### Description
Our setup involves using Celery with Redis over Sentinel in a Kubernetes cluster. After upgrading Redis from version 4.5.4 to 4.5.5, the Celery worker crashes without any error message. The return code after the crash is 0. 

The same image, when run on Docker-Swarm without Sentinel, works flawlessly.

### `pip freeze` Output
(I have removed irrelevant packages)
```plaintext
billiard==3.6.4.0
...
django-redis==5.2.0
...
hiredis==2.2.3
...
kombu==5.3.0
...
redis==4.5.5  # <= The problematic version; downgrading to 4.5.4 resolves the issue
requests==2.31.0
...
urllib3==1.26.16
...
```

### Related Issues
- Issue #8268 seems unrelated as it has a different error message.

### Summary
- **Celery Version**: 5.2.7
- **Redis Version**: 4.5.5 (downgrading to 4.5.4 resolves the issue)
- **Platform**: Linux (Kubernetes cluster)
- **Return Code**: 0
