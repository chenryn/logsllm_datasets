### Outcome for Various Neurological Diseases

Microdialysis is a powerful technique for in vivo sampling of extracellular fluid in the brain, enabling continuous measurement of neurotransmitters in freely-moving animals. However, metabolic analysis of microdialysis samples presents a significant analytical challenge due to limited sample volumes and low basal (nanomolar-range) concentrations of many metabolites. In this study, we developed a capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) method for profiling amino acids and related compounds in rat brain microdialysates using direct sample injection. CE was coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) via a co-axial sheath-liquid interface and a bare fused-silica capillary. Amino acids were analyzed under low-pH separation conditions using 10% acetic acid (pH 2.2) as the separation buffer. To enhance the concentration sensitivity of CE-MS, an in-capillary preconcentration procedure was applied, allowing for large volume sample injections. The developed CE-MS system enabled the direct analysis of amino acids in rat brain microdialysis samples after a simple centrifugation step. Low nanomolar detection limits were achieved for the compounds, with minimal sample matrix effects. This is the first CE-MS method for the direct profiling of amino acids and related compounds in rat brain microdialysate samples. The utility of this approach will be tested by analyzing a large set of rat brain microdialysate samples in a pharmacokinetic and biomarker discovery context using metabolomics.

There is growing interest in fecal fingerprinting as it may reveal the symbiotic interplay between the host, diet, and intestinal ecosystem, providing characteristic signatures of responsive metabolic discrepancies related to gut (patho)physiology and beyond. It is crucial to capture and conserve a realistic snapshot that reflects the dynamic metabolome at the time of (outpatient) sampling to avoid erroneous interpretations and misleading associations regarding the disease and parameters under observation. This study addresses the current lack of preservation guidelines for the stability of the fecal polar metabolome and lipidome, using in-house developed and validated extraction and UHPLC-HR-Q-Orbitrap-MS methods (Vanden Bussche et al., 2015; Van Meulebroek et al., 2017, Anal. Chem.). Through targeted profiling (n > 400) and untargeted fingerprinting, combined with univariate and multivariate data analysis, the effects of freeze-thawing (up to 2 cycles), storage duration (up to 25 weeks), storage temperature (-20°C and -80°C), and (an)aerobicity were assessed. For the polar metabolome fraction, the impact of aerobicity was negligible, attributed to lyophilization of the fecal material. Conversely, freeze-thawing significantly affected metabolome composition, with the first cycle being predominant. For example, elevated concentration levels were observed for amines and amino acids. Monitoring the long-term stability, particularly of low-molecular-weight metabolites, was conducted in 150 subjects per study.

### Serum and Dried Serum Spots Analysis

Serum and dried serum spots were collected from children, and one untargeted UPLC-MS assay (C18 reversed phase) was applied to analyze plasma and urine metabolites, followed by univariate and multivariate analysis. Markers indicative of increased blood retinol levels included (lyso)glycerophospholipids, ceramides, and acyl glycerides, as observed in the pig study. Conclusions: Potential markers of vitamin A levels and hypervitaminosis A have been identified in a pig model and validated in two independent human studies.

Alcohol consumption leads to tissue damage, but the molecular mechanisms contributing to this damage are not fully understood. Our goal was to identify pathways affected in the liver by chronic alcohol consumption. Eight to ten-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a modified ethanol-containing liquid diet (Lieber-DeCarli, n=4) or an ethanol-free diet (control, n=5) for six weeks. Mice on the ethanol diet started at 2% (v/v) and the ethanol concentration was increased by 1% weekly until reaching 6% (v/v). At the end of the sixth week, livers were collected for blinded histological examination and untargeted metabolomic analyses. Multivariate analyses determined differences in the metabolic profiles between ethanol-treated and control mice. Targeted metabolomic analyses quantified significant features uncovered in the untargeted metabolomic analyses. Histological examination revealed no inflammatory or injury differences, but enlarged bile ducts were observed in the ethanol-treated mice. The most prominent change in the metabolic profile of ethanol-treated mice occurred in the bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Utilizing targeted metabolomics, we quantified 19 bile acids. Significant (P<0.05) increases in primary bile acid cholic acid (5.0-fold), and its taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids, including taurodeoxycholic acid (2.0-fold), taurohyodeoxycholic acid (3.0-fold), glycocholic acid (11.5-fold), and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (4.8-fold), were observed in the ethanol-treated mice. Our study provides new insights into hepatic changes occurring early during chronic alcohol consumption. The role of the dysregulated bile acid pathway in liver damage remains to be established.

Metabolomics may provide novel insights into the etiology of prostate cancer, for which few risk factors are established. We investigated the association between patterns in baseline plasma metabolite profiles and subsequent prostate cancer risk, using data from 3057 matched case-control sets from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). We measured 119 metabolite concentrations in plasma samples, collected on average 9.4 years before diagnosis, by mass spectrometry (AbsoluteIDQ p180 Kit, Biocrates Life Sciences AG). Metabolite patterns were identified using treelet transform, a statistical method for identifying groups of correlated metabolites. Associations of metabolite patterns with prostate cancer risk (OR[1SD]) were estimated by conditional logistic regression. Supplementary analyses were conducted for metabolite patterns derived using principal component analysis and for individual metabolites. Men with metabolite profiles characterized by higher concentrations of phosphatidylcholines and hydroxysphingomyelins (OR[1SD]=0.77, 95%CI 0.66-0.89), acylcarnitines C18:1 and C18:2, glutamate, ornithine, and taurine (OR[1SD]=0.72, 0.57-0.90), or lysophosphatidylcholines (OR[1SD]=0.81, 0.69-0.95) had a lower risk of advanced-stage prostate cancer at diagnosis, with no evidence of heterogeneity by follow-up time. Similar associations were observed for the two former patterns with aggressive disease risk, while the latter pattern was inversely related to the risk of prostate cancer death (OR[1SD]=0.77, 0.61-0.96). No associations were observed for overall prostate cancer or less aggressive tumor subtypes. In conclusion, metabolite patterns may be related to a lower risk of more aggressive prostate tumors and prostate cancer death, and might be relevant to the etiology of advanced-stage prostate cancer.

Alcoholic liver disease remains a leading cause of chronic liver disease, with increased morbidity and mortality. In recent years, biomarkers discovered through metabolomics have shed light on disease biochemistry, sparking interest in ethanol-induced biochemical perturbations. In this study, the metabolic profiles of mouse cerebral tissue following short- or long-term ethanol exposure were analyzed. The long-term experiment (8 weeks) involved C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks old) separated into control and ad libitum feeding with a Lieber-DeCarli ethanol diet group for 8 weeks, containing daily 5% alcohol. The short-term animal experiment was conducted over 11 days, with a single dose by oral gavage of 25% alcohol administered on the 5th day of the intervention and 6 hours before sacrifice on the last day. The experiment was conducted in accordance with current national and European legislation (Ν. 2015/1992, ΠΔ 56/2013, European guideline 2010/63), and cerebral tissues were collected postmortem. Untargeted metabolic profiling analysis was performed using HRAM Q-TOF-MS (LCMS-9030, Shimadzu) with precursor and product ion scanning at 50 spectra per second within a mass range of m/z 50-1000. Univariate statistical analysis revealed that the short-term experiment decreased arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, glycerophosphocholine, CDP-choline, adenine, adenosine, cytidine, creatine, creatinine, valine, taurine, and some phospholipids. Long-term exposure decreased acetyl-carnitine, adenine, and adenosine, along with phospholipids and ceramides, while many amino acids, hypoxanthine, xanthine, oxoproline, choline, and creatinine were increased.
