**Current Behavior**
Currently, only XLF files are supported for internationalization (i18n).

**Expected Behavior**
I would like to see support for JSON files as an alternative to XLF files for i18n.

**Motivation / Use Case for the Change**
In my workflow, I typically do not utilize the extract and merge capabilities for i18n. Manually writing XML in a JavaScript environment is cumbersome. I prefer using JSON files with key-value pairs for translations, as it is more intuitive and aligns better with the JavaScript ecosystem. A solution similar to `ng2-translate` in terms of file definitions would be ideal, as it provides a more efficient and user-friendly approach to managing translations.
