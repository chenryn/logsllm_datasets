### Challenges in Tracing Botmasters via SSH and Stepping Stones

When botmasters use encrypted connections, such as SSH, to manage their botnets, traditional packet analysis methods that rely on individual packet properties (e.g., length and timing) become ineffective. This is because the encryption masks these properties, making it difficult to trace the communication.

#### SSH as the Final Hop

When SSH is used as the final hop in a chain of stepping stones, it presents unique challenges. In this scenario, the botmaster logs into a stepping stone using SSH, launches a command-line-based IRC client, and uses this client to connect to the botnet. Unlike a proxy that simply passes messages verbatim, SSH transfers the "graphical" screen updates of the running IRC client, which may not be directly correlated with the incoming IRC messages. This transformation of application-layer content alters the relative lengths of packets, complicating our tracing approach. We are actively working on addressing this issue but have not yet fully explored it. It's worth noting that if SSH is used for tunneling (e.g., port forwarding or as a SOCKS proxy) in the middle of the stepping stone chain, this limitation does not apply.

#### Watermarking and Intermediate Stepping Stones

Once the botmaster becomes aware of our flow watermarking approach, they may attempt to corrupt the embedded watermark from intermediate stepping stones. However, since the padding characters can be almost any character and are inserted randomly, it is challenging for an intermediate stepping stone to identify and remove them without knowing the original unwatermarked message. The botmaster might detect and remove the padding if they know exactly what to expect, but by the time they receive the watermarked message, the trail has already been established. To counteract this, the botmaster could add random padding to perturb the length of passing botnet messages. However, the negative impact of such padding tends to cancel out, as the watermark is embedded in the length differences between randomly chosen packets. We can further mitigate this by using redundant pairs of packets to encode the watermark, though this would increase the number of required packets, creating a trade-off between robustness and efficiency.

#### Network Coverage and Monitoring

As discussed in Section 2.2, our approach requires at least partial network coverage by distributed monitoring stations. This is a common requirement for network traceback approaches, as global coverage is not necessary. The accuracy of the trace is directly proportional to the number and placement of monitoring nodes.

### Future Work

Our work represents a significant step towards live botmaster traceback, but it is just the beginning. Future research will explore several topics, including optimal deployment of monitoring nodes, handling SSH traffic on the last hop, further data collection with longer stepping stone chains, and conducting traceback experiments on real-world botnets.

### Related Work

The field of botnet research is relatively new but has seen a surge in publications as the threat has grown. Early work, such as the Honeynet Project, provided a foundation for understanding and combating botnets. Subsequent studies, like those from Johns Hopkins University, developed frameworks for acquiring and analyzing bot binaries. Initial efforts focused on defining, understanding, and classifying botnets, with notable contributions from Cooke et al., Dagon et al., Ianelli and Hackworth, Barford and Yegneswaran, and Holz. As bot detection became a focal point, various techniques were proposed, including anomaly-based detection by Binkley and Singh, and the Rishi tool by Goebel and Holz.

Despite extensive literature on botnet detection and removal, little work has been done on finding and eliminating the root cause: the botmaster. Freiling et al. described a manual method for infiltrating botnets to locate the botmaster, but it lacks scalability due to the lack of automation.

In the general traceback field, two main areas of interest are network-layer (IP) traceback and tracing approaches resilient to stepping stones. Leading works in IP traceback include Savage et al.'s probabilistic packet marking and Goodrich's "randomize-and-link" technique. For tracing across stepping stones, inter-packet timing has been used to correlate encrypted traffic, with both passive and active methods being explored. Our proposed method uses packet length and timing to encode the watermark, requiring fewer packets than existing methods.

### Conclusion

Our key contribution is addressing four major obstacles in botmaster traceback: stepping stones, encryption, flow mixing, and low traffic volume. Our watermarking traceback approach is resilient to these challenges and can track watermarked flows even when mixed with randomized chaff traffic. This makes it uniquely suited for real-time tracing of interactive, low-traffic botnet C&C communication. We validated our approach both analytically and experimentally, achieving nearly 100% true positive rate with a false positive rate of less than \(10^{-5}\). Our method can successfully trace a watermarked IRC flow from a botnet member to the botmaster's true location, even if the flow is encrypted, passes through multiple stepping stones, and travels globally.
