It would be much more convenient to install Elasticsearch via `apt`, similar to the installation process for MongoDB, as detailed in their official documentation: [Install MongoDB on Ubuntu](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/#install-mongodb).

Do you have any plans to provide an `apt`-based installation method for Elasticsearch?
