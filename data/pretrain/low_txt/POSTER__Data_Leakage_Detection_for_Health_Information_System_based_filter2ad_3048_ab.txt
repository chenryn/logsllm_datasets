### Sensitive Data Identification in Medical Images Using CNN and FPN

#### 1. Introduction
The proposed model aims to identify and classify bounding boxes containing sensitive data in medical images. The feature extraction is performed using a standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with ResNet-101, enhanced by a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). This combination allows for better representation of objects at different scales, improving the overall feature extraction and selection.

#### 2. Methodology

##### 2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing
Medical images used for experimentation are explicitly defined for research purposes. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with 80% of the images used for training and 20% for evaluation. Sensitive keywords are fed into the model for annotation, and the sensitive data on the medical images are annotated with polygonal bounding boxes using the VGG Image Annotator (VIA). The annotations are saved in JSON files, one per folder of images. These JSON files, along with the resized medical images, are used to train the model. The sensitive data is identified based on the area covered by the polygonal points as specified in the JSON file.

##### 2.2 Model Selection
The proposed model utilizes Mask R-CNN with ResNet-101, augmented by RefineNet and FPN. The ResNet-101 classifier is used to classify images containing sensitive data. The FPN combines low-resolution, semantically strong features with high-resolution features, allowing for the integration of features from lower and higher levels through bottom-up and top-down pathway connections.

##### 2.3 Training
The pre-trained ResNet model is not used due to differences in input samples and expected outputs. The training process involves initializing random values for weights (W) and biases (b) and adjusting them to improve prediction accuracy. The initial weights are set using `mask_rcnn_coco.h5` from the Microsoft COCO object detection dataset. The model's predictions are compared to the actual output, and the weights and biases are adjusted accordingly. The training process is repeated over 300 epochs, with each epoch consisting of 100 steps. The batch size is set to one, as inference is performed on one image at a time.

#### 3. Evaluation
The developed prototype system is deployed as a web service using OpenEMR as a test environment. Users access the medical management system through a browser, where they can open Electronic Health Records (EHRs) containing patient information, including avatars, medical prescriptions, and external instrument data (e.g., X-rays, ultrasound images). Despite warnings from medical ethical policy committees, patient demographics are often exposed, leading to the leakage of private health information. Recent studies have reported that millions of medical images and records are publicly available on servers, lacking adequate security precautions.

To address this, the system uses memory introspection via a lightweight hypervisor. The locations of target memory sections are recorded in `/proc/iomem` and marked as "System RAM." The browser process ID is gathered, and its virtual memory area is mapped to extract all `.jpg` images. These extracted images are then fed into the sensitive data identification model for testing and identification of sensitive data.

#### 4. Conclusion
The proposed system leverages memory introspection and neural network-based pattern recognition to detect sensitive data in various applications. Unlike traditional Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems, which inspect data crossing security perimeters or monitor access events on endpoints, our system examines raw data consumed by application programs. This approach not only bypasses the need for transport or at-rest encryption but also remains effective in environments with less stringent security perimeters, such as health information systems.
