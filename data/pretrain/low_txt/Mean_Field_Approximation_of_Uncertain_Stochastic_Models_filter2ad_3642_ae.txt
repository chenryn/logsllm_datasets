### 1. Introduction

The following text describes a system where jobs of different types are processed by a single machine. The jobs' sizes and the machine's capacity are modeled using exponential distributions, and the machine serves the jobs using a Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) policy. We also compare two scenarios for job arrivals: Poisson and Markov Arrival Process (MAP). The text includes numerical analysis and simulations to evaluate the system's performance under different policies and arrival processes.

### 2. System Model

#### 2.1 Job Characteristics and Machine Capacity
- **Job Size**: The size of a job of type \(i\) is exponentially distributed with mean \(1/\mu_i\).
- **Machine Capacity**: The machine has a capacity \(C\), meaning it takes on average \(1/(\mu_i C)\) units of time to serve a job of type \(i\).

#### 2.2 GPS Policy
- **Queue Length**: Let \(Q_i\) be the number of jobs of type \(i \in \{1, 2\}\) waiting to be completed.
- **Service Fraction**: The machine uses a fraction \(\frac{\phi_i}{\phi_1 Q_1 + \phi_2 Q_2}\) of its time to serve each job of type \(i\), where \(\phi_i > 0\) is a weight that gives priority to a specific type of job.

#### 2.3 Job Arrivals
- **Poisson Arrivals**: An application of type \(i\) waits an exponentially distributed time with mean \(1/\lambda_i\).
- **MAP Arrivals**: An application of type \(i\) waits an exponentially distributed time with mean \(1/a_i\) before becoming active, and then sends a job after another exponentially distributed time with mean \(1/\lambda_i\).

### 3. Numerical Analysis

#### 3.1 Imprecise Scenario
- **Arrival Rate Interval**: The rate of job creation belongs to an interval \([\lambda_{\min}, \lambda_{\max}]\).
- **Objective**: To perform robust optimization of the system parameters and to show the importance of the precise distribution of the arrival process.

#### 3.2 Simulation Results
- **Comparison of Policies**: Figure 6 compares the simulations of the stochastic system with two policies, \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\), and the Birkhoff center of the differential inclusion.
- **Queue Length Analysis**: Figure 7 shows the maximal queue length as a function of time for the uncertain and imprecise models. For the Poisson scenario, the uncertain and imprecise models give the same upper and lower bounds on the queue length. For the MAP scenario, the maximal queue length is significantly larger due to the delay introduced by the activation time.

### 4. Conclusions

- **Imprecise Population Processes**: These processes naturally capture the uncertainty and imprecision in complex systems.
- **Efficient Analysis**: The framework allows for efficient analysis of large population models using differential inclusions and numerical methods.
- **Robust Optimization**: The imprecise approximation can be used to robustly tune controllable parameters, such as resource allocation weights, to minimize the maximum total queue length.
