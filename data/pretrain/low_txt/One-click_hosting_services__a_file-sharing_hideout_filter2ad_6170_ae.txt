### Estimation of Copyrighted Content on Public OCH Indexing Sites

To estimate the fraction of copyrighted content indexed on public OCH (One-Click Hosting) indexing sites, we manually examined the 100 most recent objects listed on each content indexing website. We classified an object as copyrighted if it was a commercial movie, song, book, or application, based on the official web page of the corresponding content. Figure 17 illustrates the percentage of objects that appear to be copyrighted. More than 84% of the 100 most recent objects, and in some cases 100% of the objects, appear to be copyrighted.

### Responsibility of OCH Services

We note that OCH services, including RapidShare, are not responsible for any illegal file sharing and copyright infringements that occur using their infrastructure. Specifically, RapidShare agrees to host a file only if the uploading user declares that the content is not copyrighted. Additionally, RapidShare does not provide indexing and search capabilities for the content they store. Therefore, any copyright infringements that occur using their infrastructure are solely the responsibility of the users who upload and download such content.

### Classification of Objects

Table 5 presents the classification of 100 objects from each content indexing website. The table shows the distribution of different types of content, such as games, videos, applications, and books, across various indexing sites.

| Website          | Games | Videos | Apps | Books | Images | Audio |
|------------------|-------|--------|------|-------|--------|-------|
| egydown.com      | 19    | 45     | 100  | 21    | 4      | 0     |

| rslinks.org      | 21    | 1      | 1    | 0     | 3      | 0     |

### Comparison with P2P Networks

Users often turn to OCH services because they typically offer better content availability and higher throughput compared to peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Research on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), such as Akamai, has focused on evaluating and improving redirection and server selection algorithms, which result in lower latency and improved quality-of-experience for end-users. Krishnamurthy et al. demonstrated in 2000 that the use of multiple distributed servers and caching in content distribution can enhance end-to-end web performance [20]. Johnson et al. measured the performance of two CDNs, Akamai and Digital Island, and noted that both systems provide good but not optimal performance [17].

Krishnamurthy et al. proposed a methodology to study client-experienced performance using CDNs and conducted an extensive study on the use of such systems [21]. Saroiu et al. performed a trace-based characterization of four content delivery systems: Gnutella, Kazaa, WWW, and Akamai [26]. Their results showed that Akamai consumed only a minimal amount of traffic (0.2%), while Gnutella, WWW, and Kazaa followed with 6.04%, 14.3%, and 36.9%, respectively.

### Conclusions

Using a combination of passive monitoring and active probing, we provide, to our knowledge, the first detailed study of OCH services, with a particular focus on RapidShare. Our results indicate that OCH services have become popular enough to generate a significant share of daily web traffic, sometimes exceeding the traffic generated by YouTube and similar online video services.

Most users download more than one file during their daily sessions. Over several months of observation, we observed very little locality of reference in the objects downloaded through OCH services, likely reflecting the diverse interests of file-sharing users. These patterns suggest that there would be no significant benefits from caching content near users, indicating that a centralized architecture is appropriate for OCH services. Our experiments revealed that RapidShare employs a centralized, heavily multi-homed server infrastructure located at a single geographical location. RapidShare servers are grouped into sets of 12, with each server in the group hosting the same set of files. Each server in the same group belongs to a different IP subnet and is often connected to a different ISP. With frequent infrastructure expansions, RapidShare aims to keep its storage capacity evenly distributed among all server groups by favoring recently added servers for new file uploads.

Comparing RapidShare with BitTorrent, we found that RapidShare provides better performance. While free RapidShare users experience similar throughput to BitTorrent users, premium RapidShare users experience an order of magnitude higher throughput. Furthermore, the amount of content shared over RapidShare is larger than that shared via BitTorrent, and the availability of content on RapidShare persists for longer periods.

### Related Work

File sharing has attracted significant interest over the past decade, particularly with the emergence of P2P protocols. Extensive research has been conducted on the impact of P2.P networks [7, 13, 16, 23, 24]. Saroiu et al. studied the characteristics of participating peers in Napster and Gnutella, observing significant heterogeneity and lack of cooperation [25]. Sen and Wang analyzed the characteristics and bandwidth requirements of P2P traffic in large networks [27]. Leibowitz et al. examined file popularity in the Kazaa network and its effect on total traffic volume [22].

Gummadi et al. examined the file-sharing workloads of Kazaa and Gnutella, revealing significant popularity deviations between objects shared in Kazaa and web objects, largely due to the "fetch-at-most-once" behavior of Kazaa users [12]. Karagiannis et al. showed that ISPs can benefit, in terms of cost, from locality-aware P2P distribution [18]. Our results for OCH services suggest that caching will not benefit ISPs, as 75% of the files in our 4-5 month traces were downloaded only once.

Several recent studies have focused on emerging Web 2.0 applications that host user-generated content. Gill et al. studied the characteristics of YouTube users' content in an academic network [10], and Cha et al. also studied user-generated content sites by crawling YouTube and Daum [4]. Both studies found that the YouTube video workload is similar to traditional web workloads, suggesting that end-users and organizations can benefit from caching policies or distribution through P2P systems. In late 2008, Cho et al. observed a slow but steady movement of residential users towards rich-media content, like YouTube, by comparing data from 2005 and 2008 [5]. During our study period, we did not observe a significant increase in OCH traffic, but we expect users to continue to prefer OCH services for their superior performance and content availability.
