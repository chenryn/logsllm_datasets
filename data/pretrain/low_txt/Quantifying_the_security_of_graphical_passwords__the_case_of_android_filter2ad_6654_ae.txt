### Confidence Intervals and Statistical Significance

We derived confidence intervals of 8.72±0.38, 9.10±0.65, and 10.90±0.45 for G0.1, G0.2, and G0.5, respectively, at a 90% confidence level. These results indicate that the differences between the circle and random patterns are statistically significant, even with only 50 samples.

However, this analysis has some limitations. The sampled subsets are likely not disjoint due to the insufficient number of samples (only 114). Despite this, we believe these intervals are indicative of the significance of the results, especially since they were obtained from just 50 samples. A larger sample size would likely yield even smaller confidence intervals.

### Usability Considerations

The primary objective of our study was to measure the security of the Android Unlock Pattern scheme, as discussed in Section 3.2. Additionally, we introduced minor changes to the graphical layout to understand the rationale behind users' choices for Android Unlock Patterns. While usability was not the main focus of the study, we collected data that provides insights into the usability of the resulting schemes.

First, we recorded the number of attempts required for participants to correctly enter their passwords. Second, we noted the number of attempts needed after a 20-minute period. Both metrics provide an indication of the memorability and usability of the scheme. Table 3 compares the usability of all approaches using these metrics. The plain Android Unlock Pattern performed slightly better than the Leftout Large, Circle, and Random approaches. Only the Leftout Small approach required fewer attempts on average for participants to recall their pattern.

One possible explanation for this is that many participants had prior experience with Android Unlock Patterns, as supported by informal inquiries during the study. This familiarity made it easier for them to choose and remember a password in this arrangement. This aligns with the fact that the Leftout Small approach, which is most similar to the plain Android Unlock Pattern and has the fewest nodes, performed the best. Conversely, the other approaches, being new to the participants, performed slightly worse, particularly the Random approach, where only 62% of participants could recall their secret within five attempts.

In conclusion, our new arrangements do not surpass the plain Android Pattern Login in terms of usability. However, we attribute this to the novelty of the approaches rather than any inherent shortcoming. Further investigation into improving usability through user training on the new arrangements is beyond the scope of this article.

### Conclusions and Future Work

To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale user study of Android Unlock Patterns, focusing on actual entropy rather than theoretical key space sizes. Our findings, based on a study with 584 participants, show that around 10% of users use less than 190 patterns, and less than 300 patterns capture approximately 50% of the test population, corresponding to 7.56 and 8.19 bits of entropy, respectively, for offensive patterns (see Table 2). Recruiting these participants was time-consuming and the main bottleneck of our approach. The dataset is sufficiently large to create Markov models of transitions between points in the 3×3 grid, allowing us to derive a very efficient attack and approximate the exact strength of the unlock patterns. However, as explained in Section 3.2, these values are likely upper bounds on the strength expected in real-world systems.

To deepen these insights, we tested four simple modifications of the Android Unlock Patterns. Interestingly, the Circle pattern was both simple and relatively secure, suggesting that people prefer following lines. Removing these lines, as in the Leftout Small and Large approaches, increased overall entropy. The Random pattern was too challenging for users to recognize, leading to weaker passwords. This might change if users had more time to familiarize themselves with the pattern, but this is outside the scope of this article.

We believe further exploration of the ideas presented in our work is warranted. First, other untested patterns may offer better security while maintaining usability. Second, providing visual feedback to users about the strength of their chosen pattern (e.g., red for weak, green for strong) could enhance security, though this must be done more accurately than current "password rules" for text-based passwords and should consider usability. Third, preventing attackers from building an attack dictionary by using different challenge patterns for different smartphones or users could also improve security.
