**Abstract:**
This paper presents the implementation and benchmarking of an architecture that semantically integrates Web services with a peer-to-peer (P2P) infrastructure to enhance service availability through fault tolerance. As organizations increasingly adopt Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) to support business-to-business (B2B) transactions, the need for high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability becomes critical. The proposed architecture, named Whisper, leverages emerging technologies such as the semantic Web, Web services, and P2P networks to build the next-generation service-oriented systems. The design, implementation, and performance analysis of Whisper are described, demonstrating its ability to significantly increase the availability of Web services while minimizing the impact on the complexity of B2B distributed applications.

**1. Introduction**
The adoption of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) has enabled organizations to map their business processes more coherently with enterprise applications. Web services, a key component of SOA, allow the externalization of atomic business capabilities by making business interfaces more transparent. However, current Web service specifications, such as SOAP and WSDL, do not provide robust mechanisms to handle system failures and prevent service downtime. This can be particularly problematic in B2B environments where service interruptions can have significant financial and operational consequences.

Our work aims to address these challenges by designing, implementing, and benchmarking a fault-tolerant architecture called Whisper. This architecture uses the features and characteristics of P2P networks to develop a transparent and scalable mechanism to increase the availability of Web services. Additionally, Whisper employs semantic ontologies to enable the integration and interoperation of Web services and P2P networks.

**2. Web Service and P2P Integration Challenges**

**2.1. Heterogeneity and Integration Challenges**
Integrating Web services and P2P infrastructures, such as JXTA, poses several types of heterogeneity issues similar to those encountered in distributed database systems. These include:
- **System Heterogeneity:** Differences in the underlying systems.
- **Syntactic Heterogeneity:** Disagreements in the format and structure of data.
- **Structural or Schematic Heterogeneity:** Differences in the schema or data models.
- **Semantic Heterogeneity:** Disagreements in the meaning and interpretation of data.

Whisper addresses these challenges, with a particular focus on semantic heterogeneity. It uses ontology representation languages, such as OWL, to ensure that information is shared and exchanged in a semantically consistent manner.

**2.2. Semantic Data Integration**
Web services and JXTA networks use different standardized technologies, leading to incompatibilities in data schemas. To integrate these systems at the semantic level, we annotate the input and output data of Web services and JXTA peers using ontological concepts. This allows for the matching of semantics during data exchange, which is not possible with syntactic information alone.

**2.3. Semantic Functional Integration**
Web service and JXTA peer specifications typically define only syntactic characteristics, such as operation signatures. To represent the functionality of services, Whisper annotates Web services and JXTA peers with functional semantics. This approach enables a more precise expression of service functionality, facilitating better integration and interoperability.

**2.4. Other Integration Issues**
In addition to semantic data and functional integration, another important aspect is semantic Quality of Service (QoS) integration. Managing QoS metrics for peers allows organizations to select the most suitable peer based on quality criteria. This is particularly useful for translating organizational visions into business processes more efficiently.

**3. Semantic Web Services and SWS-Proxies**

**3.1. Semantic Web Services**
Traditional Web services are described using WSDL, which provides only syntactical information. However, this can be a limitation during the automatic discovery of peer groups. To address this, Whisper uses the WSDL-S specification to map WSDL descriptions to ontological concepts. For example, a Web service operation 'StudentInformation' is annotated with ontological concepts from the specified OWL ontology.

**3.2. SWS-Proxies**
SWS-Proxies play a crucial role in the Whisper architecture by acting as intermediaries between clients and the P2P infrastructure. They facilitate the semantic integration of Web services and P2P networks by handling the translation and mapping of ontological concepts.

**4. B-Peer Groups, B-Peers, and Semantic Advertisements**
Redundancy is a well-known technique for increasing the availability of distributed systems. In Whisper, key components are replicated to protect against failures. B-Peer groups and B-Peers are used to manage and distribute the load, while semantic advertisements are employed to disseminate information about the available services and their QoS metrics.

**Conclusion**
The Whisper architecture demonstrates a novel approach to enhancing the fault tolerance and availability of Web services in B2B environments. By leveraging the strengths of P2P networks and semantic Web technologies, it provides a robust and scalable solution for integrating and managing distributed applications. The benchmarking results show that Whisper can significantly improve service availability while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of B2B distributed applications.
