### Description
Hello Team Airflow,

Could you please add support for Flask-AppBuilder version 4.1.0? I am encountering vulnerability issues that have been resolved in this version. For reference, see [dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder#1831](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/issues/1831).

### Use Case/Motivation
After running the `safety` tool (available at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/safety/)), it was identified that all versions of Flask-AppBuilder below 4.1.0 have known vulnerabilities. Upgrading to version 4.1.0 will address these security concerns.
