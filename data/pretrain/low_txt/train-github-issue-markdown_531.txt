### Apache Airflow Version
2.5.0

### Issue Description
Prior to the release of the Azure provider version 5.0.0, the `WasbHook.get_file` method required only three arguments: `file_path`, `container_name`, and `blob_name`. However, with the latest update, the underlying `WasbHook.download` method now requires two additional parameters: `length` and `offset`. This change is inconsistent with the `BlobClient.download_blob` method, where `length` and `offset` are optional.

### Expected Behavior
The `length` and `offset` parameters should remain optional in both the `WasbHook.download` and `WasbHook.get_file` methods, aligning with the behavior of the `BlobClient.download_blob` method.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Call the `WasbHook.get_file` method with only the initial three arguments: `file_path`, `container_name`, and `blob_name`.
