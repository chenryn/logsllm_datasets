### Service Time Analysis
By comparing the timestamps of the mobile originating (MO) and mobile terminating (MT) Call Detail Records (CDRs) of a message, we can estimate the time a message spent in the SMS system, which we call the service time.

There are three types of messages:
- Successfully delivered messages: 94.9%
- Denied messages: 3.5%
- Expired messages: 1.6%

**Figure 3** plots the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the service times for all three types of messages. The figure shows that:
- 73.2% of successfully delivered messages reach their destination in less than 10 seconds, supporting the conventional characterization of SMS as "near real-time."
- 17% of delivered messages take more than one minute.
- 5% require more than an hour and a half.

Service times can be attributed to factors such as processing latency at the SMS center, address resolution from the Home Location Register/Visitor Location Register (HLR/VLR) server, network and radio resource shortages. However, extraordinarily long service times are more likely due to mobile user behavior, such as the phone being unreachable due to mobility or out of service (e.g., powered off, in sleep mode, or inactive).

We have collected detailed traces from the operation of SMS over the SS7 stack to identify the exact causes contributing to the service time.

### Expiration Times
For the 1.6% of messages that expired before reaching their destinations, their service times tend to fall into two specific values: around 2 days and 3.3 days. In principle, the expiration time for a message is manually configurable before it is sent. However, our observation suggests that either this option is not allowed by mobile devices, or if it is allowed, users do not extensively use it, preferring preset values instead. This should be considered when developing analytical models for message delay.

### Retries Analysis
**Figure 4** shows the cumulative distributions of retries required for delivered, denied, and expired short messages. In [2], reasons for message delivery failure are classified into four categories: network, terminal, radio interface, and general problems. As part of future work, we plan to extract the exact reasons for delivery failures by analyzing the traces from the operation of SMS over SS7.

## Thread-Level Characteristics

In person-to-person, two-way instant communication, mobile phone users often send messages to each other to say "hello," prompt for something, arrange a meeting, etc. Equally often, a response is sent back, leading to a conversation through the exchange of short messages, similar to Instant Messaging.

Unfortunately, SMS does not incorporate the concept of threads or sessions. Messages exchanged between two users are not associated with each other, even though they could be grouped into a conversational thread. As wireless immediate messaging [7] is being integrated with Internet-style instant messaging systems [9] that incorporate the notion of threads, the design of a unified messaging system will need to characterize this behavior. Such a characterization could be used as input for performance evaluation of any thread- or session-based protocol design for instant messaging [8].

### Grouping Messages into Threads
We group messages into conversational threads by following the approach in [10]. Specifically, we merge consecutive, mobile-originated messages exchanged between the same two users into a thread if each message was sent within a predefined timeout period from the previous one. We experiment with relatively large timeout values, 1 minute and 10 minutes, to account for the time users typically need to reply and type the message using the somewhat inconvenient keypad of cell phones. We also exclude threads that fall near gaps in our traces to protect the validity of the results.

### Limitations
Before presenting the results, we would like to explicitly state the limitations of the analysis:
1. It is based only on traces collected from the SMS message center of a single cellular carrier. Cross-validation with logs from other locations is necessary before generalizing the conclusions.
2. The identification of threads is based on the somewhat arbitrary assumption of grouping messages that are exchanged between two users using a timeout value, but this hypothesis cannot be verified with the current logs or even with traces from the underlying SS7 protocol, since no notion of thread (or session) exists in the system.

### Results
- **Figure 5.1: PDF for Number of Messages in Each Thread**
- **Figure 5.2: PDF for Number of Handoffs in Each Roaming Thread**

We identify 2.47 million threads in total. On average, each thread consists of 4.9 messages. Of the 2.47 million identified threads, 87.1% are static, meaning that neither of the two users participating in the thread changes the associated Mobile Switching Center (MSC) throughout the thread. This implies that for 87.1% of all threads, thread mobility can be handled at the Base Transceiver Station/Base Station Controller (BTS/BSC) level.

We further study the remaining 12.9% of the identified threads, which are roaming threads. In roaming threads, at least one user switches to another MSC during the thread duration. **Figure 5.2** plots the distribution for the number of handoffs that occurred during the lifetime of roaming threads. The figure shows that more than half of the roaming threads, i.e., 61.1%, experience only one handoff at the MSC level.

### Modeling Thread Duration and Arrival Process
- **Figure 7: Empirical CDF for Thread Duration and Fitted Analytical Distributions**
- **Figure 8: Average Deviation of Thread Interarrival Times from Various Analytical Distributions at Each MSC**

We model the thread duration against simple analytical distributions. **Figure 7** gives the empirical CDF and the CDFs fitted by analytical distributions. The Weibull model provides the minimum deviation, followed by the Lognormal model. On average, the thread duration is 8 minutes.

We also model the thread arrival process at individual MSCs by comparing the thread interarrival times against analytical distributions. To make the test statistically meaningful, we only consider the 35 MSCs that have generated more than 50 threads. **Figure 8** shows the average deviation of the analytical distributions when applied to each of the 35 MSCs. The figure indicates that the thread interarrival times are well modeled by either the Weibull or the Gamma distribution. For either of these distributions, the interarrival times at 34 MSCs can be well modeled with the average deviation less than 0.5. This result holds when the timeout is set to 1 minute.

## Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we study the SMS traffic in a nation-wide cellular network, touching on aspects such as characteristics of short messages, message size distributions, and their arrival process. We examine the "store-and-forward" mechanism of SMS, a central factor in its success as a convenient communication method. By grouping messages exchanged between users into conversation threads, we seek to characterize the traffic at the thread/session level. To the best of our knowledge, similar studies have not been presented in the research community before, mostly due to the proprietary nature of cellular networks.

As part of ongoing work, we plan to systematically assess the reliability of the SMS system. This becomes particularly important as SMS is being considered for mission-critical applications such as emergency alerts [16] and notifications for natural disasters [18]. For example, **Figure 9** shows the message arrival rate around New Year's Eve 2005, based on another set of traces obtained from the cellular network around that period. The SMS system is clearly overloaded, with the message rate increasing to more than eight times its normal value. Such an overload incident poses a significant risk for the reliability of the SMS service during special events such as holidays, especially if the system is not provisioned appropriately.
