## Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a novel side-channel attack that exploits small vibrations of a hanging light bulb to eavesdrop on sound. We demonstrate how these vibrations, caused by sound waves hitting the bulb's surface, can be captured and analyzed using an electro-optical sensor. Our method is evaluated in a realistic setup, showing that it can be used to recover songs from a target room containing the hanging light bulb.

## 1. Introduction
Recent studies have shown that measurements from motion sensors near a victim can be used to classify words [2, 3, 5, 8]. These studies demonstrated that MEMS gyroscopes [5] and accelerometers [2, 3, 8] can be used for word classification based on their response to sound. Other methods use optical sensors to recover sound [4, 6]. The laser microphone [6] recovers sound by directing a laser beam through a window and analyzing its reflections. The visual microphone [4] uses a high-speed video camera (2200 FPS) to analyze the response of materials (e.g., a bag of chips) to sound waves, recovering speech.

In this paper, we present a new side-channel attack that allows eavesdroppers to recover sound from a room containing a hanging light bulb. Our method uses an electro-optical sensor directed at the bulb, which vibrates due to air pressure fluctuations caused by sound waves. We evaluate our method's performance in recovering songs in a realistic setup, demonstrating that it can be used to recover songs from a bridge located 25 meters away from the target office.

## 2. Threat Model
We assume a victim in a room or office with a hanging light bulb. The eavesdropper, a malicious entity, aims to spy on the victim to capture conversations and exploit the information, such as stealing credit card numbers or performing extortion.

Our method consists of:
1. **Telescope**: Focuses the field of view on the hanging bulb from a distance.
2. **Electro-optical Sensor**: Mounted on the telescope, converts light into an electrical current.
3. **Sound Recovery System**: Receives the optical signal and outputs the recovered acoustic signal. This can be implemented with dedicated hardware or processed using a sound recovery algorithm on a laptop.

The conversation in the victim's room creates sound \( s(t) \) that causes air pressure fluctuations on the bulb's surface, leading to vibrations. These vibrations are measured by the electro-optical sensor via the telescope. The analog output is sampled by an ADC to a digital optical signal \( o(t) \), which is then processed to recover the acoustic signal \( s^*(t) \).

## 3. Evaluation
### 3.1 Recovering a Frequency Scan
We examined the effect of the setup on optical measurements, noting the challenge posed by curtain walls. We played a chirp function (100-1000 Hz) and obtained optical measurements, repeating the experiment without curtain walls.

**Results**: Figure 2 shows that curtain walls significantly reduce the light captured by the electro-optical sensor, especially at high frequencies (above 400 Hz).

### 3.2 Recovering Songs
We evaluated our method's ability to recover non-speech audio by attempting to recover two well-known songs: "Let it Be" by the Beatles and "Clocks" by Coldplay.

**Experimental Setup**: We played the songs in the target office, directed the electro-optical sensor at the bulb, and obtained measurements.

**Results**: Figure 3 presents spectrograms of the raw optical signals and the recovered audio signals compared to the original songs. The quality of the recovered songs was further assessed using Shazam and SoundHound, which accurately identified both songs. Screenshots of the correct identifications are shown in Figure 4.

## 4. Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce a new side-channel attack that recovers sound from a room containing a hanging light bulb. More details about this research can be found in the extended version [7].
