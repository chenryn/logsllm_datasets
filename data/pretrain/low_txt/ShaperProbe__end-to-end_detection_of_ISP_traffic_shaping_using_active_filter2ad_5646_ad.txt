**Capacity (Kbps)**
- 5000
- 10000
- 15000
- 20000
- 25000
- 30000

**Data Points:**
- 0.9
- 0.8
- 0.7
- 0.6
- 0.5
- 0.4
- 0.3
- 0.2
- 0.1
- 0
- 0

**Directions:**
- Upstream
- Downstream

**Additional Information:**
- An associated burst size mode is referenced in [17].
- Approximately 80% of the 333 runs with shaping rate modes are from hostnames that resolve to the domain mchsi.com, which is owned by the cable ISP Mediacom [9]. This suggests that these shaping detections may not be errors.

### 5. Conclusion

In this work, we introduced an end-to-end active probing, detection, and estimation method for traffic shaping in ISPs. Our evaluation, conducted through controlled experiments and in two known ISP deployments, indicates that ShaperProbe has false positive and false negative detection rates of less than 5%. We presented a large-scale study of shaping at four major ISPs and validated some of our observations using ISP-advertised tier data. The strong modality of shaping rates and burst sizes suggests that ISPs typically deploy a small set of shaping configurations. Some shaping detections were found where the ISPs do not mention shaping in their service descriptions. However, the lack of publicly available information does not necessarily imply that these are false detections. We are currently working on passive shaping detection methods, and preliminary results can be found in [17].

**Note:**
- ISPs generally state in their SLAs that "listed capacities may vary."

**Response from the Authors:**
- **Long vs. Short Paper:**
  - A longer version includes more implementation details and a passive detection method.
  - The passive method is significantly different and will be published separately.
  - The short paper focuses on the active method and cannot include all details.
- **Revisions:**
  - Addressed presentation issues.
  - Added more information on how the tool works.
- **Cross Traffic and Bucket Size:**
  - Small token buckets have minimal performance impact and are detectable.
  - ShaperProbe aborts measurements if significant cross traffic is detected, avoiding erroneous results.
