**Limiting CNAME Chain Lengths**

DNS resolvers can impose stricter limits on the length of CNAME chains. As Section 4.2 demonstrates, there is no consensus among resolvers regarding the maximum chain length. Overly restrictive limits can be detrimental, as legitimate use cases, such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and DDoS protection services, often require longer chains. Domain owners frequently configure their DNS to point to a CDN subdomain, which in turn may use one or more CNAME records.

To ensure compatibility with all DNS resolvers, legitimate CNAME chains must adhere to the shortest supported recursion limit. We analyzed the Active DNS [21] dataset to identify benign CNAME chains. From the data collected on October 5, 2017, we reconstructed the longest benign chain, consisting of eight elements (seven CNAMEs and one final resource record). This aligns with the shortest recursion limit of nine elements observed for Unbound. Other studies [38] have also reported that the longest legitimate chain found consists of nine elements, and certificate authorities are required to support chains of this length when fetching CAA RRs [13]. Based on these observations, we recommend setting a recursion limit of nine elements, which is the minimum value supported by all tested resolvers and covers benign chains. Such a limit would restrict the amplification of chaining attacks to a factor of five.

**Related Work**

**Application-Layer DDoS in DNS:**
Several application-layer DDoS defenses have been proposed in the past [12, 30, 39, 52]. However, many of these defenses are not directly applicable to DNS. Protocol changes, such as client puzzles, would require widespread adoption, which is unrealistic in the short to medium term. Countermeasures that introduce additional latency are particularly problematic, as DNS is designed for high efficiency. Filtering techniques, such as egress or ingress filtering, are not suitable for DNS Unchained, as it operates without IP address spoofing. Blocking DNS traffic can even lead to increased inbound traffic [51] and risks blocking legitimate users.

The most relevant work to our research is the study of DNS water torture attacks, first presented in February 2014 [1]. These attacks are well-known to DNS operators [17, 48, 50, 51], who have focused on implementing mitigations to stabilize recursive resolvers. Takeuchi et al. [47] proposed a system to detect DNS water torture attacks using lexical and structural features of domain names. They trained a naive Bayes classifier and tested it on network traffic from their university. Our attack is related to DNS water torture, as both involve flooding attacks using resolvers, but water torture attacks are more easily detectable.

**Reflection and Amplification Attacks:**
DNS has also played a role in recent amplification attacks. The general risk of reflection attacks was identified by Paxson [37], and Rossow [44] detailed their full amplification potential. Various proposals to detect and defend against amplification attacks [23, 36, 44, 49] have been made, including approaches to combat bandwidth exhaustion, such as client puzzles, or prevent source address spoofing. In the context of DNS, Kührer et al. [24, 25] analyzed the amplification potential of DNS resolvers, finding millions of open resolvers on embedded devices and routers, suggesting that openness is likely a configuration issue. The potential for DNSSEC to increase the amplification of DNS resolvers has also been documented [40]. While some attacks do abuse DNS, they do not represent application-layer attacks and are easier to filter compared to our work.

**CNAME Chaining:**
The ability to chain CNAME records is well-documented. For example, Shue and Kalafut [46] used differences in recursion strategies to fingerprint resolver implementations. Dagon et al. [8] used CNAME chains to amplify the number of queries from each resolver, requiring multiple queries to analyze source port randomization. Pfeifer et al. [38] measured the overhead for resolvers while resolving CNAME chains and recommended that authoritative name servers (ANSs) should refuse CNAME chains before loading zone files. They also suggested that ANSs should query the destinations of CNAME RRs, similar to our recommendation in Section 5.1. Unlike previous work, our attack focuses on authoritative name servers rather than resolvers.

**Conclusion**

We have introduced a new DDoS attack against DNS authoritatives, leveraging amplification on the application layer. DNS Unchained achieves an amplification factor of 8.51 using standard DNS protocol features, such as CNAME chaining, and forces resolvers to repeatedly query the same authoritative name server. Through full Internet scans, we identified 10,054,077 open DNS resolvers and 178,508 recursive resolvers, with 74.3% supporting uncachable DNS responses, creating a large pool of amplifiers for chaining attacks.

We also discussed countermeasures to mitigate DNS chaining attacks. These include measures for DNS operators to identify and limit problematic DNS zones, enforce minimal Time-to-Live (TTL) values for caching, and reduce aggressive retransmissions on unavailable name servers. Setting a recursion limit of nine elements for resolvers is also recommended. Widespread deployment of these techniques would significantly degrade the effectiveness of such attacks, and we hope our work raises awareness of their importance.
