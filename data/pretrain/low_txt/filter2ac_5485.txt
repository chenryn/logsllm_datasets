**ATT&CK ID:** G0112  
**Technique Name:** Windshift

**Description:**
Windshift has been known to use revoked certificates to sign malware, as documented in references [8] and [9]. 

This approach allows the malware to appear more legitimate, potentially evading detection by security systems that do not check for certificate revocation status.
