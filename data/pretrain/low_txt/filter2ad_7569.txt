## 1. Introduction
Internet video delivery is undergoing a significant transformation, with live video increasingly dominating on-demand content in terms of user engagement. For instance, PC viewers watch live video 11 times more than on-demand video [2]. Platforms like Twitch, YouTube Live, and Ustream support a wide range of workloads, from mega-events (e.g., sporting events) viewed by tens of millions of users to less popular channels in the "long-tail." The rise of user-generated live content has introduced unpredictable popularity dynamics, making it challenging to provision video delivery networks effectively.

CDNs face several challenges in delivering live video:
1. **Quality Metrics**: CDNs are responsible for a significant portion of video quality issues, including 20% of join failures and 22% of bitrate degradation [6].
2. **Real-Time Delivery**: Unlike on-demand video, live video cannot benefit from prefetching or caching, requiring real-time content delivery.
3. **Viral Content**: The shift towards viral, user-generated live streams introduces rapid changes in popularity.
4. **Higher Bitrates**: CDNs must handle higher bitrate streams (e.g., 15+ Mbps 4K streams [10]), which can easily consume 150+ Mbps per channel.

While techniques such as placing edge servers closer to users and improving last-mile links exist, we argue that dynamic, fine-grained control over the internal delivery network is essential. A successful live video delivery system must provide:
- **Quality**: Optimize for application-specific metrics (e.g., high bitrate).
- **Dynamic Provisioning and Scalability**: Support thousands of live video streams and millions of users, scaling to thousands of CDN distribution clusters.
- **Responsiveness**: React to user- and network-induced events with low latency (less than a second).

Existing solutions, such as traffic engineering schemes (e.g., SWAN [4], B4 [5]) and traditional DNS-based redirection [9], do not meet all these requirements. To address these challenges, we present the Video Delivery Network (VDN), a new CDN architecture designed specifically for live video. VDN focuses on two key areas: video-specific global optimization and a scalable, robust control plane operating at a very fine timescale.

## 2. System Overview and Results
VDN leverages existing CDN infrastructure but redesigns its control plane to handle the unique challenges of live video distribution. Our contributions include:

- **Centralized Coordination Algorithm**: An algorithm that optimizes for live-video-specific objectives using an approximate linear optimization. It selects the most efficient combination of distribution trees to maximize video-specific metrics (e.g., highest supported bitrate). This algorithm scales to the workload of today’s largest CDNs (thousands of concurrent live video streams delivered via 1,000-2,000 clusters) while delivering near-optimal results.

- **Hybrid Control Approach**: A hybrid control approach where individual clusters can safely deviate from the central algorithm to respond to changes in network conditions and/or viewership at the timescale of hundreds of milliseconds. This ensures responsiveness while maintaining sustained quality at Internet scale.

### System Design
Figure 1 illustrates our design. A local agent in each cluster discovers link and viewership information, which it forwards to the central controller as a network graph. The central controller computes globally optimal distribution trees using a linear program and sends the results back to the clusters. This forms the global control loop.

If the local agent detects a new event (e.g., new channel request, link failure), it responds locally (subject to certain restrictions), forming the local control loop. We ensure that these two control loops do not conflict.

### Summary of Results
- **Quality Comparison**: Figure 2(a) compares different algorithms for building distribution trees. VDN provides a 2x improvement in average video bitrate over traditional CDN deployments, scaling to 600 video channels and 1,000 CDN distribution clusters.
- **Responsiveness**: Figure 2(b) shows VDN's response time in a 10-machine deployment on Amazon EC2. Our hybrid control plane allows VDN to react to network and viewership changes within hundreds of milliseconds, with much less variation than a purely local approach.
