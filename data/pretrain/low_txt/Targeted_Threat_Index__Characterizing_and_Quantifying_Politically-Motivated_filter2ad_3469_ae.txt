### For Rating the Sophistication of Technical Vulnerabilities

While significant research has been conducted on detecting targeted malware attacks and modeling campaigns, no existing scoring system comprehensively considers both the sophistication of malware and the social engineering tactics employed in such attacks. We address this gap by developing the Targeted Threat Index (TTI) and validating it against four years of data collected from 10 Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).

### 7. Conclusions

Our study provides an in-depth analysis of targeted malware threats faced by CSOs. We find that evaluating only the technical sophistication of these threats is insufficient; educating users about social engineering tactics can be a powerful tool for enhancing organizational security. Our results highlight simple steps that organizations can take to protect themselves from document-based targeted malware, such as transitioning to cloud-based document platforms instead of relying on potentially malicious attachments.

Further research is needed to measure the effectiveness of educational strategies in changing user behavior and their impact on mitigating document-based malware for CSOs. Additionally, continuous monitoring is required to observe how attackers adapt their tactics in response to observed behavioral changes in targeted communities.

In ongoing work, we are continuing to collect emails and Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) alerts, as well as monitoring other types of attacks (e.g., waterhole attacks and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks) to understand how threats vary based on their delivery mechanisms. We are also extending our methodology to more diverse CSO communities, such as those in Latin America, Africa, and other underreported regions, to better document politically motivated digital threats they may face.

### Appendix: Examples of Targeted Emails

#### Targeting Score 1 (Targeted, Not Customized)
**Figure 6: Example of e-mail with Targeting Score 1**
- **From:** [Sender]
- **To:** [Tibet Group 1]
- **Subject:** Invitation
- **Date:** [Date]
- **Attachment:** invitation.doc

**Content:**
Please reply.

**Analysis:**
The email in Figure 6 was sent to Tibet Group 1. The message content and sender are vague and do not relate to the interests of the group. The attachment is a Word document implanted with malware. The lack of relevant information in this message gives it a score of 1 (targeted, not customized).

#### Targeting Score 2 (Targeted, Poorly Customized)
**Figure 7: Example of e-mail with Targeting Score 2**
- **From:** [Sender]
- **To:** [Tibet Group 1]
- **Subject:** Truth of monk dies after setting himself on fire
- **Date:** 18 Aug 2011
- **Attachment:** setting himself on fire.doc

**Content:**
Truth of monk dies after setting himself on fire.

**Analysis:**
The email in Figure 7 was sent to Tibet Group 1. It references Tibetan self-immolations, which is an issue of interest to the group. However, the sender does not appear to be from a real person or organization. The message content is terse and does not reference information that can be externally validated. Therefore, this message scores a 2 (targeted, poorly customized).

#### Targeting Score 3 (Targeted, Customized)
**Figure 8: Example of e-mail with Targeting Score 3**
- **From:** Palden Sangpo
- **To:** [Tibet Group 2]
- **Subject:** Activity Report from Tibetan Career Centre, Bylakuppe
- **Date:** 24 Jan 2013

**Content:**
Dear Sir/Madam,

Tashi Delek.

Please find the attachment of the activity report of Tibetan Career Centre, Bylakuppe with this mail. As I was asked to send this activity report to your office.

Thank you.

Regards,
Palden Sangpo, Consultant.
Tibetan Career Centre,
Old Guest House, Lugsam Tibetan Settlement Office,
PO Bylakuppe, Mysore District, Karnataka State - 571 104
E-mail: [Email]
MO +91 9901407808, Off +91 8971551644
www.tibet.jobeestan.com

**Attachment:** Report to CTA home.doc

**Analysis:**
The email in Figure 8 was sent to Tibet Group 2. On the surface, it appears to be a professional email from "Palden Sangpo," a consultant at the Tibet Career Centre. The email sender address and signature reference accurate contact details that can be easily verified through an Internet search. However, the email headers reveal that the purported email sender address is fraudulent, and the actual sender was albano_kuqo@gmx.com. The email generally addresses the organization rather than the individual recipient. Therefore, this message scores a 3 (targeted, customized).

#### Targeting Score 4 (Targeted, Personalized)
**Figure 9: Example of e-mail with Targeting Score 4**
- **From:** Cheng Li
- **To:** [Tibet Group 1]
- **Subject:** Happy Tib Losar and Ask You a Favor
- **Date:** 23 Feb 2012

**Content:**
Dear [Redacted],

I will attend an annual meeting on Religious Research with CIIS in Shanghai next week, and plan to take the chance to visit Tibet. Attached is a list of Tibetans who have self-immolated from 2009, which my assistant prepared for me, but I am not sure of its accuracy. Would you please have a look and make necessary corrections? I will be really much appreciated if you could do me the favor and offer some more information about the latest happenings inside Tibet.

Thank you again and happy Tib losar!

Cheng Li
Director of Research, John L. Thornton China Center
Brookings Institution

**Attachment:** list_of_self_immolations.xls

**Analysis:**
The email in Figure 9 was sent to Tibet Group 1. It is directly addressed to the director of the group and appears to come from Mr. Cheng Li, a prominent China scholar based at the Brookings Institute. The email address is made to appear to be from Mr. Cheng Li, but from an AOL account (PI:EMAIL) that was registered by the attackers. The message asks the recipient for information on recent Tibetan self-immolations. The level of customization and personalization used in this message gives it a score of 4 (targeted, personalized).

#### Targeting Score 5 (Targeted, Highly Personalized)
**Examples:**
- An email that purported to come from a funder of China Group 3, providing details of an upcoming meeting the group actually had scheduled with the funder.
- Separate emails sent to Tibet Group 2 and Tibet Group 3 containing specific personal details about a South African group’s visit to Dharamsala, India, which appear to have been repurposed from a real private communication. The malicious attachment contained an authentic travel itinerary, which would be displayed after the user opened the document. The private information used in these messages suggests that the attackers performed significant reconnaissance of these groups and likely obtained the information through prior compromise.

These examples illustrate the high level of personalization and internal knowledge used by the attackers, giving them a score of 5 (targeted, highly personalized).
