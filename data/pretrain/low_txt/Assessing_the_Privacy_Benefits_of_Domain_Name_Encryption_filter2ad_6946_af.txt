### A Breakdown of the Five Largest TLDs Studied

As shown in Table 3, our derived list comprises an average of 7.5 million popular fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) collected daily, covering 1,031 top-level domains (TLDs). Over the entire duration of the experiment, we studied a total of 13.6 million domains and 1,125 TLDs. Table 3 also highlights the top five largest TLDs in our dataset, with .com being the most dominant, comprising more than 50% of the observed domains.

| Daily | Total |
|-------|-------|
| 1,031 | 1,125 |
| 7,556,066 | 13,597,409 |
| 3,835,080 | 7,026,005 |
| 347,993 | 584,924 |
| 264,057 | 501,597 |
| 263,262 | 442,729 |
| 210,701 | 346,194 |

### B Poisoned Response Sanitization

While processing public DNS datasets from various sources (to which we compare our findings in §6), we discovered thousands of low-ranked or obscure domains seemingly co-hosted on the same IP addresses as very popular websites, such as Facebook and Twitter. This, of course, was not actually the case.

As part of our investigation, we observed that the authoritative servers of most of these domains were located in China (using the MaxMind dataset [71]). We then queried the same domains from outside China using their authoritative servers and received responses pointing to IP addresses belonging to either Facebook or Twitter. By inspecting network traffic captures during these name resolutions, we observed that the initial response containing the wrong (falsified) IP address was followed by another DNS response with the same valid DNS query ID, but containing a different (correct) IP address.

We attribute this behavior to DNS-based censorship by the "Great Firewall" (GFW) of China [1, 24, 67, 102, 104, 107], which has been observed and analyzed by previous studies [2, 39]. Censorship leakage occurs due to the GFW's filtering design, which inspects and censors both egress and ingress network traffic. While some censors (e.g., Pakistan, Syria, Iran) forge DNS responses with NXDOMAIN [13, 20, 22, 73] or private addresses [12], making them easier to distinguish, China poisons DNS responses with routable public IP addresses belonging to other non-Chinese organizations [39, 49, 104]. Unlike previous works, in this case, the real hosting IP addresses of the censored domains are located within China, while previous studies mostly focus on the blockage of websites hosted outside China (e.g., google.com, facebook.com, blogger.com).

To validate our findings, we cross-checked the IP addresses from the second (real) DNS responses with those obtained by resolving the same domains from locations in China. As the authoritative servers of these domains are also in China, our queries did not cross the GFW, which primarily filters traffic at border ASes [2, 26, 103], and thus were not poisoned.

### Table 4: Most Frequently Abused Subnets in Poisoned DNS Responses from China

| AS Number | Organization | Subnets |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| AS32934   | Facebook     | 31.13.72.0, 31.13.69.0, 31.13.73.0, 31.13.66.0, 69.171.245.0 |
| AS13414   | Twitter      | 199.59.148.0, 199.59.149.0, 199.16.156.0, 199.59.150.0, 199.16.158.0 |
| AS36351   | SoftLayer    | 74.86.12.0, 67.228.235.0, 74.86.151.0, 75.126.124.0, 67.228.74.0 |

We follow this verification technique, where we issue additional queries to resolve domains whose authoritative name server is located in China and then detect injected DNS packets to exclude poisoned responses from analyses. In total, we detected more than 21,000 domains based in China with poisoned responses. Table 4 shows the top /24 IP subnets belonging to Facebook, Twitter, and SoftLayer, which are the most frequently observed in poisoned responses. Our observation aligns with recent findings of other censorship measurement studies [49, 75].

### C Reverse DNS Lookups

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) recommends that it should be possible to conduct a reverse DNS lookup for every given domain [37]. In a forward DNS lookup, a domain name is resolved to an A (IPv4) record, while a reverse DNS lookup sends out an IP address to ask for its associated FQDN. The DNS record storing this information is called a PTR (pointer) record. Although performing reverse DNS lookups seems straightforward for mapping a given IP address back to its associated FQDN, this can potentially uncover only single-hosted domains. More importantly, not all reverse DNS queries return a meaningful domain name because the IETF’s recommendation is optional and not universally adopted.

We analyzed Rapid7’s reverse DNS dataset, which contains PTR records for the entire public IPv4 space, to see how many IP addresses could reveal the visited destinations under the assumed global ESNI deployment, by just performing a reverse DNS lookup. We found that there are 1.27 billion unique IP addresses with PTR records. Of these, at least 172 million (14%) point to a meaningful FQDN (i.e., not in the form of dash-separated IP segments). Within this set of domains, we identified 136,000 single-hosted domains observed in our dataset. This means about 10% of single-hosted domains have PTR records configured. Under a global ESNI deployment, the IP addresses of these domains would be detrimental to the privacy of users who connect to them.

As expected, we also observed more than 3 million PTR records in which domain names explicitly indicate through the prefix “mail” that they correspond to email servers. These email servers support PTR records because many providers will not accept messages from other mail servers that do not support reverse lookups [66].

**Note**: Many PTR records are formatted with dash-separated IP segments. For example, the Amazon EC2 IP address 54.69.253.182 has a PTR record to ec2-54-69-253-182.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com, which may not correspond to a user-facing web service.
