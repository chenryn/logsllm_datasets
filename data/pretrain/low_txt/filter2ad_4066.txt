## Abstract
Following the success of the first edition, the second Workshop on Attacks and Solutions in Hardware Security (ASHES) 2018 continues to address all aspects of hardware security. This year, the workshop particularly highlights emerging techniques, methods, and recent application areas within the field. These include new attack vectors, countermeasures, and novel designs and implementations on the methodological side, as well as the Internet of Things (IoT), automotive security, smart homes, and pervasive and wearable computing on the applications side. To meet the requirements of these rapidly developing subareas, ASHES calls for paper submissions in four categories: 1) classical full papers; 2) classical short papers; 3) systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that overview, structure, and categorize a subarea; and 4) wild and crazy (WaC) papers aimed at the rapid dissemination of promising, potentially game-changing ideas.

## 1. Introduction and Motivation
Billions of hardware devices are coming online to form the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). These devices have the potential to improve our lives, but if not properly protected, they could also open us to novel risks and vulnerabilities. An attack on such a large number of devices could have catastrophic effects on our economies. A clear example of the devastating consequences of such an attack was the 2016 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack made possible via the Mirai botnet, which rendered much of the Internet on the US east coast unavailable for almost an entire day.

The security community has long recognized that many classical solutions cannot be easily applied to the constrained hardware devices often found in IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) domains. Identifying convincing security solutions appropriate for these domains remains a challenge. The main scientific challenges to be addressed are related to the fact that IoT and CPS devices are typically extremely constrained in computational resources and cost, yet they often need to meet the same security requirements as more powerful systems due to the safety and time-critical nature of their applications. Furthermore, their applications may demand that the devices operate within untrusted environments, which can expose them to various types of attacks. Particularly pressing questions in this context include:

- How can we get individual cryptographic keys into billions of low-cost hardware devices?
- How can we securely identify low-cost hardware over digital channels, e.g., systems without digital signal processors or devices powered by scavenged energy?
- How can we protect against tampering and side-channel attacks in low-cost hardware?
- How can we remotely verify the functionality and integrity of connected IoT devices?
- How can we establish the long-term confidentiality of communications with resource-constrained hardware?
- How can we protect the IoT and its hardware against malware (viruses, Trojan horses, etc.) and network attacks?
- How can we enable secure physical data storage in lightweight hardware systems?
- How can we preserve the privacy of users in pervasive IoT scenarios?

This workshop aims to bring together the Computer and Communications Security (CCS) and hardware security research communities to identify solutions for these and other problems in hardware and embedded systems security. The unique challenges of the IoT and CPS application domains call for novel methods and solutions supporting hardware security. It is the hope of the organizers that, by bringing together these communities, the workshop will promote novel research in this domain.

## 2. Topics
ASHES focuses on hardware and embedded security research. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Tamper sensing and tamper protection
- Physical attacks (fault injection, side-channels, etc.), including new attack vectors or methods
- Biometrics and hardware security
- Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and new/emerging variants
- Device fingerprinting and hardware forensics
- Banking security (including ATM security) and chipcard security
- Item tagging, secure supply chains, and product piracy
- Use of emerging computing technologies in security (including quantum techniques)
- New designs and materials for secure hardware
- Nanophysics and nanotechnology in hardware security
- Hardware Trojans and countermeasures
- Lightweight security solutions, primitives, and protocols
- Secure and efficient hardware implementation of cryptographic primitives
- Security of reconfigurable and adaptive hardware platforms
- Secure sensors and sensor networks, including physical attacks and countermeasures
- Hardware security in emerging application scenarios: IoT, smart home, automotive and autonomous systems, wearable computing, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, etc.
- Scalable hardware solutions that work for particularly large numbers of players/endpoints
- Secure and scalable hardware implementation of machine learning algorithms
- Formal treatments, proofs, standardization, or categorization of the area

## 3. Paper Categories
To account for the special scope of the workshop and the particular nature of hardware security as a rapidly developing discipline, the workshop allows four different categories of paper submissions:

- **Full Papers:** Up to 10 pages in ACM double-column format (including references and appendices), with a 25-minute presentation timeslot at the workshop (including questions).
- **Short Papers:** Up to 6 pages in ACM double-column format (including references and appendices), with a 15-minute presentation timeslot at the workshop.
- **Wild and Crazy (WaC) Papers:** 3 to 6 pages in ACM double-column format, with additional appendices and references of up to 6 pages, and a 15-minute presentation timeslot at the workshop (including questions). WaC papers target groundbreaking new methods and paradigms for hardware security. Their focus lies on novelty and potential impact, and on the plausibility of their argumentation, but not on a full demonstration or complete implementation of their ideas. Wild and crazy papers must bear the prefix “WaC:” in their title.
- **Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) Papers:** Up to 12 pages (including appendices and references), with a 25-minute presentation timeslot at the workshop. SoK papers evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge. They should serve the community by fostering and structuring the development of a particular subarea within hardware security. Ideally, but not necessarily, they might provide a new viewpoint on an established, important subarea, support or challenge long-standing beliefs with compelling evidence, or present a convincing new taxonomy. Systematization of knowledge papers must bear the prefix “SoK:” in the title.
