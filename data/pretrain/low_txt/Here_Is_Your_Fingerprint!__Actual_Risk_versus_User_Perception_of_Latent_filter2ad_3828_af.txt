### Finger Preference on Touch Screens

In Section 5.2, we noted that the majority of participants preferred using their thumbs and index fingers on touch screens across all scenarios. Table 3 provides the full results of the χ² test for each scenario.

### Under-Screen Touch Sensors

In February 2017, Apple registered a patent to utilize the entire touch screen area of the iPhone for fingerprint recognition. The touch screen would have a multi-layer structure, including a display layer, at least one transparent conductive layer, and a layer for fingerprint scanning. A dielectric layer would prevent unwanted electrical impulses, allowing the touch screen to perform both display and authentication functions. As emphasized in [36], a fingerprint biometric can be sensed during the operation of the touch display. Based on related patents [21, 36], it is assumed that Apple is working on adopting under-screen touch sensors.

### Touch ID with Half Submission

Interestingly, our experimental studies found that only half of the enrolled fingerprint could successfully pass through Touch ID. Figure 17 illustrates an actual example. This situation was also observed in the Galaxy smartphone series. This may be seen as an effort to improve usability by manufacturers. However, it also suggests that our attacks could potentially be more successful, as the fingerprint image we need to reconstruct is much smaller than initially thought. We will address this in a separate follow-up study [26].

**Figure 17: Touch ID with Half Submission**
- (a) Place a fingertip only on the half area of Touch ID.
- (b) Successful unlock with half submission.
- (c) Smudge left only on the half area of Touch ID following the successful unlock.
