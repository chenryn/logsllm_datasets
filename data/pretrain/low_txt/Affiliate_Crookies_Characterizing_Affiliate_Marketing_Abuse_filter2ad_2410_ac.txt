### Typosquatting and Its Impact

Approximately 1.8% of the observed cases resulted from typosquatting on subdomains. For example, `liinensource.com` redirects to the Rakuten LinkShare merchant `linensource.blair.com`. Upon manually inspecting 30 out of the remaining 520 typosquatted domains that resulted in affiliate cookies, we classified these domains into three categories:

- **Contextually Related Redirects**: One-third of these domains are contextually related to the final landing page. For instance, `0rganize.com` redirects to the CJ merchant `shopgetorganized.com`, while `bheal thypets.com` and `healthypts.com` redirect to the CJ merchant `entirelypets.com`.
- **Expired Offers**: Another third appear to be expired CJ offers, and thus did not redirect to any merchant site.
- **Traffic Distributors**: The remaining one-third of the cookies result from typosquatted domains selling traffic to traffic distributors such as `pureleads.com`, `7search.com`, and `blendernetworks.com`, which eventually redirect through an affiliate URL.

We will revisit traffic distributors in our discussion on referrer obfuscation later in this section.

### Use of Iframes in Cookie Stuffing

Iframes are often used to render third-party content on a web page, bypassing the Same-Origin policy implemented by browsers. Most major affiliate programs, such as HostGator and Amazon Associates, prohibit the use of iframes due to their potential for facilitating cookie stuffing. For example, HostGator explicitly states: "iframes may not be used unless given express permission by HostGator; sales made through hidden iframes or cookie-stuffing methods will be considered invalid" [10]. Similarly, the Amazon Associates Program prohibits framing any Amazon link on a page [3].

In our study, we received 420 cookies from content rendered in iframes on third-party sites. To prevent a website from being framed, a server can use the `X-Frame-Options` HTTP header with its value set to `SAMEORIGIN` (allowing rendering only on pages with the same origin) or `DENY` (completely disallowing framing). We determined that Google Chrome and Firefox honor the `X-Frame-Options` header but still save the cookies, making iframe-based stuffing effective despite the header's use.

- **X-Frame-Options Usage**: 17% of the cookies received from iframes had `X-Frame-Options` set to either `SAMEORIGIN` or `DENY`, including all Amazon Associates Program cookies. Despite this, iframes accounted for over a third of the stuffed Amazon cookies. In contrast, only 2% of CJ cookies and 50% of LinkShare cookies were accompanied by a restrictive `X-Frame-Options` header.
- **Visibility Analysis**: Using style and size information, we determined how, if at all, a user would see the corresponding iframe on the crawled page. Of the 191 iframes, 64% explicitly set the height or width to either 0 or 1px, and 25% had `visibility:hidden` or `display:none` set, making the iframe invisible to the user. Additionally, seven iframes used CSS classes to hide the iframe DOM element. Three iframes with the affiliate ID `kunkinkun` and the CSS class `rkt` specified `left:-9000px`, positioning the iframe outside the viewport. The same affiliate also defrauded the Amazon Associates Program using the same technique and ID `shoppertoday-20`. Two other examples involved iframes made invisible by setting the visibility CSS property on their parent DOM elements. The remaining 49 iframes were not hidden, and most corresponded to ClickBank.

### Use of Images in Cookie Stuffing

Images can also be used to fetch third-party content on a web page. In our dataset, 504 cookies were requested as images. Unlike iframes, every single DOM element either had width or height set to 0 or 1px, or style set to `display:none`, effectively hiding the image from the end user. We also found six cookies requested by hidden `img` elements embedded within `iframe` elements. For example, `bestblackhatforum.eu`, a domain with an Alexa rank of 47,520, stuffed cookies for three different LinkShare merchants (`UDemy.com`, `microsoftstore.com`, `origin.com`), one CJ merchant (`GoDaddy.com`), and Amazon. All these affiliate URLs were requested as hidden images with zero-pixel height and width inside iframes with `src` set to `lievequinp.com`. This setup makes detection of cookie stuffing difficult, as the actual cookie-stuffing domain is not observed in the request for affiliate URLs.

### Use of Scripts in Cookie Stuffing

Although script tags can be used to fetch third-party content by setting the `src` attribute, we found only two such stuffed cookies. However, upon manual inspection, we discovered that scripts are often used for dynamically generating hidden images and iframes that then request the affiliate URLs.

### Referrer Obfuscation

Referrer obfuscation is a technique used to hide the actual cookie-stuffing domain behind innocuous domains, making cookie stuffing via any method, such as images, opaque to the affiliate programs.

- **Intermediate Domains**: Of the 12,000 cookies we gathered, 84% were fetched via at least one intermediate domain. Specifically, 77% of all cookies were fetched via a single redirect, 4.5% via two redirects, and another 2% via three or more redirects. Only the last redirect is seen by the affiliate program in the HTTP `Referer` header.
- **Common Intermediate Domains**: A significant portion of the redirects went through a small variety of domains, including `cheap-universe.us`, `flexlinks.com`, `dpdnav.com`, `pgpartner.com`, `7search.com`, and `pricegrabber.com`. `Flexlinks.com` belongs to an affiliate program called FlexOffers, while the other domains are likely traffic distributors buying traffic and then monetizing via affiliate fraud. Over 25% of the cookies in our data contained a redirect through at least one of these traffic distributors, with 36% of all CJ cookies containing at least one of these domains.

### Prevalence of Affiliate Marketing

As described in Section 3, we gathered affiliate cookie data from 74 users over a two-month period to study how often users click on affiliate links and receive stuffed cookies. Only 12 users received any affiliate cookie, encountering a total of 61 cookies for 23 distinct merchants. Over a third of these cookies resulted from affiliate links on `dealnews.com` and `slickdeals.net`. Thus, while almost 84% of the users did not receive any cookie at all, the 12 users received an average of 5 cookies per user. Table 3 shows the high-level results.

- **Popular Affiliate Programs**: The Amazon Associates Program was the most popular, accounting for almost 51% of the cookies. CJ Affiliate was the second most popular, followed by Rakuten LinkShare. Our users did not receive any affiliate cookies from ClickBank or HostGator. This distribution differs from the networks targeted by cookie stuffers, where CJ Affiliate is targeted significantly more than Amazon.
- **Hidden DOM Elements**: None of these affiliate cookies were rendered within hidden DOM elements. We manually inspected all of them and verified that none of the source affiliate websites were stuffing cookies. To rule out the possibility that users were protected by ad-blocking extensions, we gathered the lists of extensions on their browsers and found that only four users used such extensions. From our user study, we found that users rarely encounter cookie-stuffing fraud, and affiliate marketing is dominated by a small number of affiliates.

### Conclusion

In this study, we characterized the abuse of affiliate marketing for monetary gains through techniques broadly classified as cookie stuffing. Even through targeted crawling of domains with a higher likelihood of encountering affiliate fraud, we observed only a limited amount of cookie stuffing.

- **Merchant Choices**: Merchants interested in affiliate marketing can either run their own affiliate programs or join large affiliate networks. Since affiliate networks have a larger number of merchants, they provide greater opportunities for fraudulent affiliates to target multiple merchants simultaneously. We observed that large affiliate networks are disproportionately targeted compared to merchant-run affiliate programs, which, although targeted to a smaller extent, are subjected to more sophisticated and costly cookie-stuffing techniques.
- **User Study**: We conducted a user study to determine the extent of affiliate marketing encountered by users during their daily web browsing. We found that a small number of affiliates dominate affiliate marketing, and, as with the crawling results, our users rarely encountered cookie-stuffing fraud.
