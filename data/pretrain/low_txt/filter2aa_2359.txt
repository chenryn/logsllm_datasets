*"Credible people have seen incredible things."*  
â€”Major General John Samford, Chief of Intelligence, United States Air Force, March 1953

Governments worldwide have grappled with the UFO phenomenon for a significant portion of the 20th century. The book *UFOs and Government* provides an unprecedented historical account from the perspective of these governments, offering insights into what has long puzzled citizens.

This narrative, unveiled through government documents, sheds light on the serious approach taken by military and intelligence communities regarding the UFO issue. These efforts were not undertaken lightly; they were considered matters of national security. However, the book also explores how a subject with such depth and interest was often treated as trivial, particularly by the U.S. government, and explains the rationale behind this treatment.

While the primary focus is on the U.S. government's response to the UFO phenomenon, the book also examines the approaches of other countries, including Sweden, Australia, France, Spain, and others.

#### Foreword by Jerome Clark
"Although *UFOs and Government* revisits an often unhappy history, reading it is far from an unpleasant experience. The authors, who are eloquent, intelligent, sophisticated, and conscientious, provide the first credible, comprehensive overview of official UFO history in many years. The majority of the book focuses on U.S. military and intelligence responses, but it also includes richly informative chapters that expand the story internationally. For those seeking an example of a nation that dealt productively with UFO reports, the chapter on French projects is particularly enlightening. From now on, any responsible treatment of UFOs and government will need to cite *UFOs and Government* prominently among its sources. This is the most accurate reconstruction of the real story as it can be pieced together in the second decade of the new century. I plan to keep my copy close at hand and refer to it frequently. While it cannot be said of many books, UFO-themed or otherwise, this is one of the essential ones. Stray from it at your peril."
