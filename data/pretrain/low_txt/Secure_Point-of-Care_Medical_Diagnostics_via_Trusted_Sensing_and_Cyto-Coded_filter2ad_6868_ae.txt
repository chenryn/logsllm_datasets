### Figure 16: Cluster Representing Beads of Multiple Sizes for Password Generation

The figure shows clusters representing beads of different sizes (3.58 μm and 7.8 μm) and actual blood cells, with clear margins. As discussed earlier, MedSen can accurately recover the concentration of different types of beads (Figures 12 and 13). Therefore, MedSen can use both different bead types and their concentration levels to generate unique identifiers in patient blood samples efficiently.

We observed that lower bead concentrations exhibit less variance and improved resolution compared to higher concentrations (as seen in the figures). This allows MedSen to define different concentration levels of the same bead type more precisely, even when they are close to each other. This increases the password space size and entropy, thereby enhancing the overall security against brute-force attacks.

### VIII. Related Work

In this section, we review recent related work in signal encryption, medical device security, and microfluidic biomarker detection.

#### General-Purpose Symmetric Encryption
General-purpose symmetric encryption [4] requires deciphering the samples on the server side for analysis, which would reveal the clear dataset. Existing homomorphic encryption algorithms [13] do not provide the necessary calculus flexibility and performance required for biomarker sensor measurements. Additionally, conventional cryptography works on digital data points, which would require complex analog-to-digital circuitry to be added to MedSen’s design.

#### Analog Signal Protection
Past work has proposed signal scrambling techniques [35] that implement a limited set of transformations using a key. In the medical field, INTRAS proposes a key exchange and data encryption method based on interpolation and random sampling as an alternative symmetric encryption technique for electrocardiogram physiological signals [2]. These techniques are implemented in software and require powerful processors to encrypt fine-grained analog signals once original measurements are acquired by the sensor hardware.

MedSen reconfigures the sensor hardware such that the acquired measurements are already encrypted. This eliminates the need for powerful computational and memory resources, reducing the size, complexity, and cost of the device while improving overall security. To the best of our knowledge, MedSen is the first physical-based encryption scheme for cytometry that does not rely on any software-based analog or digital signal manipulation.

### C. Cyto-Coded Passwords and Patient Authentication

Section V described MedSen’s cyto-coded authentication using synthetic micro-beads mixed with the patient’s blood sample. Each patient-specific unique identifier consists of a particular number (concentration) of beads from different types. Conceptually, the number of password characters corresponds to the number of bead types involved, and the specific character value within the password corresponds to the number (concentration) of beads of a particular type. Therefore, having a larger number of bead types increases the cyto-coded password space size and enhances overall security.

The two crucial requirements are:
1. MedSen’s design and peak counting analysis can distinguish peaks caused by different types of beads.
2. MedSen can distinguish different concentration levels of the same bead type within blood samples for different patients.

If the concentration levels of two patients are too close, it may confuse MedSen and lead to false user identification.

### Figure 15: Normalized Impedance Measurement of Different Particles

We evaluated the difference between the measured electrical impedance of 3.58 μm and 7.8 μm synthetic beads and actual blood cells. The results are shown in Figure 15. The normalized electrical impedance of synthetic beads and blood cells was evaluated at multiple frequencies. At frequencies of 2 MHz and higher, the blood cell has a lower electrical impedance response compared to the impedance response of synthetic beads (Figure 15a, b, and c). All these impedance measurements for different bead types at different frequencies are considered features. MedSen uses these features for classification procedures to distinguish between different particles. The proposed solution can differentiate different types of synthetic beads and blood cells effectively.

### IX. Conclusions

In this paper, we presented MedSen, a portable point-of-care disease diagnostic solution that ensures low-cost and accurate outcomes through the use of smartphone computational resources. MedSen provides in-sensor hardware-based analog signal encryption along with cyto-coded authentication services. MedSen’s specific encryption design enables cloud-based analysis of encrypted analog signals without disclosing users’ privacy and confidential medical information. Our real-world implementation of MedSen’s bio-sensor circuitry and software stack empirically proves its accurate and secure diagnostic capabilities.
