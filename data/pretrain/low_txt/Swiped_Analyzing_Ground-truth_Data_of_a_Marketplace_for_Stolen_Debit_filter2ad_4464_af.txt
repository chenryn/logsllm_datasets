### Inferred Metrics and Consumer Advice
Metrics can be inferred from partial data, such as that scraped from a shop’s public front end. Another interesting area of exploration is how to derive metrics for high-level consumer advice, such as enabling customers to compare banks based on their aggregate fraud risk.

### Conclusion
We have presented the first in-depth analysis of an underground marketplace for stolen credit and debit cards. Our findings indicate that the majority of the supply (97%) and revenue (95%) originated from stolen magnetic stripe data. Despite the U.S. shifting liability for fraud using counterfeit cards to merchants who failed to read the chip of EMV-enabled cards, the shop's supply and profits continued to increase over a three-year period.

The shop accumulated an inventory of 19 million stolen magnetic stripe accounts, but the majority (60%) of these did not sell. Buyers showed a clear preference for accounts issued by certain banks and for cards that did not support EMV, likely due to the perception that these cards were more vulnerable to fraud. While we cannot confirm the accuracy of these perceptions, the reality for affected account holders was that their stolen accounts experienced a disproportionately high number of fraud attempts compared to accounts from issuers perceived as more secure.

Our hope is that by further studying and understanding these marketplaces, we can inform new and more effective strategies for mitigating this threat.

### Appendix
In this appendix, we present additional statistics computed from the carder shop’s database.

#### Sellers
The largest seller of magnetic stripe accounts had a commission 25 percentage points higher than the average of all other magnetic stripe sellers. The largest releases contained 2.5 million magnetic stripe accounts and 8,611 CNP (Card Not Present) accounts. The smallest release for magnetic stripe was only 1 account, whereas for CNP it was 14.

#### Buyers
Magnetic stripe buyers tended to spend more than CNP buyers, as shown in Figure 6. The median net spend of magnetic stripe-only buyers was $89.35 for 7 non-refunded purchases, compared to $34.25 for 3 non-refunded purchases for CNP-only buyers. Buyers active in both domains exhibited the highest median net spend of $333.67 on 28 non-refunded purchases. Among them was the overall highest spending buyer, who, over the course of 3 years and 76 days, bought 16,200 magnetic stripe and CNP accounts (plus 752 that were refunded) for a net total of $495,000 after refunds.

#### Pricing
The shop database contained 1,300 accounts (0.02% of sales) with a purchase price higher than the initial listing price.

#### Supply and Demand
When the shop opened in the first half of 2015, sellers added between 9,255 and 41,005 unique accounts to the shop’s inventory each week, as shown in Figure 4. Nearly all supply was in U.S. magnetic stripe accounts. Supply increased drastically from November 2015 to February 2016, staying above 70,000 unique accounts per week for fifteen weeks and reaching a maximum of 123,929 before returning to the prior rhythm for another seven months. Overall, there was an average of 38,800 accounts added per week in 2015. Weekly supply increased each year, with 48,400 accounts added weekly in 2016, 64,600 in 2017, and 93,600 in 2018 and 2019.

#### Refunds
For refundable magnetic stripe and CNP accounts, customers checked 57.8% and 100% of their purchases, respectively. Actual refunds of refundable magnetic stripe purchases increased slightly from 31% in 2015 to 38% in 2018. The overall refund rates were 25% and 13% of sold accounts for magnetic stripe and CNP accounts, respectively. The lower rate for CNP might partially be due to a higher fraction of non-refundable sales. On a per-buyer basis, the median refund rates were 32% of magnetic stripe accounts and 0% of CNP (averages: 31% and 11%). High refund rates had negative consequences for buyers, as they gradually reduced the time window during which purchases were eligible for refund. Customers with over 40% refunds lost eligibility for refunds.

#### Figures
- **Figure 12:** Weekly median price of purchased accounts. The shaded area represents the range between the 25th and 75th percentiles. Median purchase prices for CNP were initially lower than for magnetic stripe accounts but increased over time, whereas magnetic stripe prices decreased.
- **Figure 13:** Box plot of time remaining until the expiration date when U.S. magnetic stripe accounts were added to the shop. From 2016 to 2018, the median remaining lifetime of non-EMV accounts increased by 110 days, suggesting that new non-EMV accounts were issued after the liability shift.
- **Figure 14:** Weekly availability of U.S. non-EMV and EMV magnetic stripe accounts in the shop, computed as the number of accounts added minus those that were purchased or expired. The shop accumulated an oversupply of EMV accounts.
- **Figure 15:** Weekly median price of purchased non-EMV and EMV magnetic stripe accounts from the U.S. The shaded area represents the range between the 25th and 75th percentiles. Before 2016, EMV accounts tended to be more expensive than non-EMV accounts, but the trend later reversed.
