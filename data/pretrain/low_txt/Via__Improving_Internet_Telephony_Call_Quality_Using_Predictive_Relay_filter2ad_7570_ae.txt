### VIA’s Relaying Heuristic with Accurate Ground Truth

For simplicity, we omit the direct path as an option.

#### Perforacle
The results are shown in Figure 18, where each curve represents the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the "sub-optimality" of VIA's performance on each call. Sub-optimality is defined as \(\text{PerfVIA} - \text{Perforacle}\). Our findings indicate that VIA's relaying decision is within 20% of an oracle's performance for 70% of the calls. Notably, this is achieved even though the best relay (i.e., sub-optimality of 0) is selected for no more than 30% of the calls. When multiple relaying options have similar performance, temporal fluctuations may prevent the selection of the absolute best option. However, VIA generally selects an option that is close in performance to the best one.

#### Overlay Routing
Overlay networking has been explored in various contexts, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and multicast [21, 31, 10]. Of particular interest is work focused on overlay routing to improve performance [33, 8]. This research demonstrated that network metrics, including delay, packet loss, and reliability, can be enhanced by using overlay paths that traverse well-chosen waypoints.

Despite its potential, overlay routing for performance gains has not been widely adopted due to several challenges. These include last-mile performance bottlenecks when using client nodes as peers and policy issues in turning stub networks (e.g., university campus networks) into de facto transit networks. Most importantly, these efforts required building overlay networks from scratch, both in terms of physical infrastructure and network probing, which limited their scalability.

Our work revisits the idea of overlay routing in the context of:
1. Global-scale managed networks, where the global infrastructure already exists.
2. A large-scale interactive real-time service, Skype, which provides a compelling need for performance improvement and passive measurements to avoid active network probing.

#### Evolution of Audio-Video Conferencing Services
The architecture of audio-video conferencing services has evolved, with a trend towards leveraging cloud resources. For example, Skype initially used a peer-to-peer approach for NAT and firewall traversal, with some well-connected clients serving as super-nodes [27]. Recently, Skype has shifted to a hybrid model, with some super-nodes hosted in the cloud [3]. It has been reported that Google Hangouts uses cloud-based relays for all calls and routes streams through the cloud backbone [37].

Our work aligns with these trends but focuses on performance rather than NAT/firewall traversal. Given our focus on managed networks, being selective in which streams are routed via the cloud is crucial.

#### CDN Server Selection
Optimal server selection is a well-studied problem, especially in content distribution networks (CDNs) [35, 34]. The main considerations in the selection process are typically the proximity of the client to replicas and the load on the replicas. Our work differs in focusing on client-to-client communication, where relay selection must prioritize end-to-end performance rather than just between the cloud edges and the client.

#### Internet Performance Prediction
There is extensive research on Internet performance prediction [22, 29, 28], focusing on metrics such as bandwidth, delay, and packet loss rate. The general approach involves selective network probing at chosen times and along chosen paths, followed by embedding network nodes in a coordinate space [18] or estimating the performance of network segments using network tomography techniques [12]. Since we have access to a large volume of call data, our work leverages this data rather than performing active measurements.

#### Measurement Studies
Over the years, numerous measurement studies have been conducted on large Internet services, including websites [30], CDNs [32], and video-on-demand streaming [16, 19]. There have also been studies of audio-video conferencing, such as active measurements to Skype super-nodes [36] or sniffing traffic in modest-size deployments [37]. To our knowledge, this is the first study of a commercial VoIP service at scale, using end-to-end performance metrics recorded by the communicating peers themselves.

#### Estimating VoIP Quality
Several models have been proposed for estimating VoIP quality, typically the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), based on network performance metrics [17, 15, 36, 13, 14]. These models vary in the specific network metrics and codecs they consider. In Section 2.2, we used the model proposed in [17], which is based on the E-Model defined by the ITU [1].

### 7. Discussion

#### Cost of Centralized Control in VIA
Our pilot deployment and client modifications suggest a feasible path to a large-scale deployment from a software update and engineering perspective. One potential concern is the scalability and responsiveness of the control platform. On one hand, VIA introduces minimal per-call overhead, as client-controller communication consists of only one measurement update and one control message exchange per call, which can be further reduced if clients cache the best relaying options. On the other hand, handling a large number of call connections at one logical controller presents a scalability challenge, though partitioning techniques provide a good starting point. We conjecture that approaches similar to the split-control architecture employed in C3 [24] might offer a scalable realization, as the measurement and control exchange of the C3 controller (which directs clients to video CDNs) is similar to the measurement and control needed for a large-scale VOIP relay server.

#### Hybrid Reactive Decentralized Approaches
A natural alternative to relay selection is to have clients sequentially or concurrently try a list of relay options and pick the best one. This approach may be sufficient for long-lived calls and avoids the overhead of data collection and generating the network map. However, given the large search space of relaying options, this may not be feasible. An interesting hybrid approach is to use prediction-guided exploration observations to prioritize or prune this approach. We intend to explore this method in future work.

#### Active Measurements
While our current solution relies entirely on passive measurements from client calls, there is an opportunity to augment it with active measurements (by making mock calls between users or from users to relays), especially since the client software can be readily controlled to make them. Active measurements can be intelligently orchestrated to fill "holes" in the passively obtained measurements, thereby enhancing our prediction-guided exploration (both its aspects—tomography and bandit solution). Implementing this will require considering the additional load imposed on the clients due to the collection.

### 8. Conclusion
By some estimates, the call volume of Internet telephony surpasses that of traditional telephony. Given its importance, we take the first step towards quantifying the impact of network performance on call quality using traces from Skype, one of the largest VoIP services. Our sampled dataset consists of 430 million calls over seven months. To mitigate calls with poor quality, we revisit classical overlay network techniques but using the managed networks of large cloud providers. Calls between users with poor network conditions can be selectively relayed via the managed network. Such managed overlays do not suffer from the drawbacks of traditional overlays.

To leverage such a managed overlay infrastructure, we present the design of VIA, a system that carefully selects a subset of calls to be relayed using the managed overlay. VIA uses a guided exploration procedure based on predicted performance derived from end-to-end measurements collected by the clients, while dealing with variances in real-world estimates and keeping the volume of relayed calls within a budget. Data-driven evaluation shows that VIA improves call quality by 45%, closely matching the potential benefits indicated by an oracle.
