### VII. CONCLUSION

While n-grams have proven highly effective for content-based anomaly detection in text-based network protocols [23, 65–67, 71], they are generally considered impractical for binary-based protocols [23]. In industrial environments and SCADA systems, the research community has thus shifted towards alternative methods, such as modeling network traffic or the underlying physical processes.

Contrary to previous beliefs, our study demonstrates that content-based anomaly detection is indeed applicable to protocols with high-entropy data. We find that the frequency values of features provide valuable information for modeling normal behavior and constructing detection models, particularly for proprietary binary protocols. The combination of learning message-type-specific prototype models and de-noising these models enables effective attack detection with a very low false-positive rate.

In an extensive evaluation using 210 GiB of network traffic from two industrial facilities, we show that ZOE significantly improves detection performance compared to related approaches. For example, our method detects 97.1% of the attacks in our dataset with only 2 false alarms out of 100,000 messages, whereas Anagram detects only 16.5% of the attacks with a 500x higher false-positive rate of 1%. Additionally, we examine the impact of polymorphic blending attacks on our detector and demonstrate that ZOE's de-noising functionality effectively limits an attacker's capabilities and enhances resistance against this type of mutation attack.
