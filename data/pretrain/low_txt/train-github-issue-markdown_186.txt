Today, we launched an 800-node cluster across two zones and discovered that 27 pod CIDRs, along with their corresponding GCE routes, were duplicated. This duplication caused significant disruptions. Although we do not have definitive evidence, we believe the issue is not related to the multi-zone setup, as some of the duplicates were found within the same zone.
