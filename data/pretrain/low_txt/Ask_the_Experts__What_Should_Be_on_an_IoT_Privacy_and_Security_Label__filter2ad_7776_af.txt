### Security Label for IoT Devices

To enhance the usability and effectiveness of the security label for IoT devices, additional user tests are essential. These tests should investigate how consumers utilize the label in real-world contexts and pinpoint areas where the wording or design can be further refined. 

We also plan to develop a comprehensive glossary of terms for consumers and an implementation guide for device manufacturers. This guide will include detailed definitions of each factor and its possible values. The latest version of the label, along with the implementation information and a tool for generating the label, is available at [www.iotsecurityprivacy.org](www.iotsecurityprivacy.org).
