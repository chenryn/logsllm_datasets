### Periodic Log Archiving

You can periodically save the active logs and open new ones. Follow these steps to set how often logs are archived:

1. Open **Server Admin** and select **AFP** in the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings** (near the bottom of the window), then click **Logging**.
3. Select “Archive every __ days” and enter the number of days to specify how often the log file contents are saved to an archive.
4. Select “Error Log: Archive every __ days” and enter the number of days to specify how often the error log file contents are saved to an archive.
5. Click **Save**.

The server will close the active log at the end of each archive period, rename it to include the current date, and then open a new log file. You can keep the archived logs for your records or delete them to free up disk space when they are no longer needed. The default setting is 7 days.

Log files are stored in `/Library/Logs/AppleFileService`. You can use the log rolling scripts supplied with Mac OS X Server to reclaim disk space used by log files.

#### From the Command Line

You can also set the AFP service log archival interval using the `serveradmin` command in Terminal. For more information, see the file services chapter of the command-line administration guide.

### Disconnecting a User

Use **Server Admin** to disconnect users from the Apple file server. Note that users will lose any unsaved information when disconnected.

To disconnect a user:

1. Open **Server Admin** and select **AFP** in the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Connections**.
3. Select the user and click **Disconnect**.
4. Enter the amount of time before the user is disconnected and type a disconnect message. If you don’t type a message, a default message will appear.
5. Click **Disconnect**.

### Automatically Disconnecting Idle Users

You can configure the AFP service to automatically disconnect users who have not used the server for a specified period.

To set how the server handles idle users:

1. Open **Server Admin** and select **AFP** in the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings** (near the bottom of the window), then click **Idle Users**.
3. To allow client computers to reconnect after sleeping for a certain time, select “Allow clients to sleep __ hour(s)—will not show as idle” and enter the number of hours clients can sleep and still automatically reconnect to the server.
4. To specify the idle time limit, select “Disconnect idle users after __ minutes” and enter the number of minutes after which an idle computer should be disconnected.
5. To prevent particular classes of users from being disconnected, select them under “Except.”
6. In the “Disconnect Message” field, type the message you want users to see when they are disconnected. If you don’t type a message, a default message will appear stating that the user has been disconnected because the connection has been idle.
7. Click **Save**.

#### From the Command Line

You can also change the AFP service idle user settings using the `serveradmin` command in Terminal. For more information, see the file services chapter of the command-line administration guide.

You can also change the AFP service greeting using the `serveradmin` command in Terminal. For more information, see the file services chapter of the command-line administration guide.

### Supporting AFP Clients

This section describes how client computers can access Mac OS X Server AFP share points.

#### Mac OS X Clients

AFP service requires the following Mac OS X system software:
- TCP/IP connectivity
- AppleShare 3.7 or later

Go to the Apple support website at [www.apple.com/support](http://www.apple.com/support) to find out the latest version of AppleShare client software supported by Mac OS X.

##### Connecting to the AFP Server in Mac OS X

You can connect to Apple file servers by entering the DNS name of the server or its IP address in the **Connect to Server** window. Alternatively, if the server is registered with Rendezvous or Network Service Location, you can browse for it in the **Network** globe in the Finder.

Note: Apple file service does not support AppleTalk connections, so clients need to use TCP/IP to access file services. You can use AppleTalk to find Apple file servers, but the connection must be made using TCP/IP.

To connect to the Apple file server from Mac OS X:

1. In the Finder, choose **Go > Connect to Server**.
2. In the **Connect to Server** pane, do one of the following:
   - Browse and select the server in the list (if it appears there).
   - Type the DNS name of the server in the **Address** field. You can enter DNS names in any of the following forms:
     - `server`
     - `afp://server`
     - `afp://server/sharepoint`
   - Type the server’s IP address in the **Address** field.
3. Click **Connect**.
4. Type your user name and password, then click **Connect**.
5. Select the share point you want to use and click **OK**.

##### Setting Up a Mac OS X Client to Mount a Share Point Automatically

As an alternative to using the network mount feature of AFP or NFS, Mac OS X clients can set their computers to mount server volumes automatically.

For Mac OS X version 10.2.6 or earlier:

1. Log in to the client computer as the user and mount the volume.
2. Open **System Preferences** and click **Login Items**.
3. Click **Add**, then locate the **Recent Servers** folder and double-click the volume you want automatically mounted.
4. The volume is added to the list of items in the **Recent Servers** folder in the user’s home Library folder.
5. When the client user logs in the next time, the server, if available, will be mounted automatically.

The client user can also add the server volume to **Favorites** and then use the item in the **Favorites** folder in the home Library.

For Mac OS X version 10.3:

1. Log in to the client computer as the user and mount the volume.
2. Open **System Preferences** and click **Accounts**.
3. Select the user and click **Startup Items**.
4. Click the **add** button (below the list), select the server volume, and click **Add**.

#### Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9 Clients

Apple file service requires the following Mac OS 8 or 9 system software:
- Mac OS 8 (version 8.6) or Mac OS 9 (version 9.2.2)
- TCP/IP
- AppleShare Client 3.83 or later

Go to the Apple support website at [www.apple.com/support](http://www.apple.com/support) to find out the latest version of AppleShare client software supported by Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9.

##### Connecting to the Apple File Server from Mac OS 8 or Mac OS 9

Apple file service does not support AppleTalk connections, so clients need to use TCP/IP to access file services. You can use AppleTalk to find Apple file servers, but the connection must be made using TCP/IP.

To connect from Mac OS 8 or Mac OS 9:

1. Open the **Chooser** and click **Server IP Address**.
2. Enter the IP address or the name of the server in the window that appears and click **Connect**.
3. Enter your user name and password, then click **Connect**.
4. Select the volume you want to use and click **OK**.

##### Setting Up a Mac OS 8 or Mac OS 9 Client to Mount a Share Point Automatically

As an alternative to using the network mount feature of AFP or NFS, clients can set their computers to mount server volumes automatically.

To set a Mac OS 8 or Mac OS 9 client computer to mount a server volume automatically:

1. Use the **Chooser** to mount the volume on the client computer.
2. In the select-item dialog that appears after you log in, check the server volume you want to mount automatically.

### Windows Service

This chapter shows how to set up and manage the Windows file service in Mac OS X Server.

#### General Information

Windows services in Mac OS X Server provide four native services to Windows clients:
- **File service**: Allows Windows clients to connect to the server using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol over TCP/IP.
- **Print service**: Uses SMB to allow Windows clients to print to PostScript printers on the network.
- **Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS)**: Allows clients across multiple subnets to perform name/address resolution.
- **Browsing**: Allows clients to browse for available servers across subnets.

This chapter focuses on setting up the Windows service for file sharing.

Windows services use the Windows code page setting to display the correct language for the client. Samba is public-domain software that provides file and print services to Windows clients. For more information about Samba, visit [www.samba.org](http://www.samba.org).

#### Windows File Services Specifications

- **Maximum number of connected users**: 1000 (depending on your license agreement)
- **Maximum volume size**: 2 terabytes
- **TCP port number**: 139
- **UDP port numbers**: 37, 138
- **Log file location**: `/Library/Logs` in the `WindowsFileServices` folder

#### Before You Set Up Windows Services

If you plan to provide Windows services from Mac OS X Server, read the following sections for issues you should consider. You should also check the Microsoft documentation for your version of Windows to find out more about the capabilities of the client software. Although Mac OS X Server does not require any special software or configuration on Windows client computers, you may want to read “Supporting Windows Clients” on page 66.

##### Ensuring the Best Cross-Platform Experience

Mac OS and Windows computers store and maintain files differently. For the best cross-platform experience, you should set up at least one share point to be used only by your Windows users. See “Creating a Share Point and Setting Privileges” on page 22.

In addition, you can improve the user experience by following these guidelines:
- Use comparable versions of application software on both platforms.
- Modify files only with the application they were created in.
- If you have Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9 clients, limit Windows file names to 31 characters.
- Avoid using symbols or characters with accents in the names of shared items.

##### Windows User Password Validation

Mac OS X Server supports several methods of validating Windows user passwords. **Password Server** is the recommended method. It supports LDAP as well as NetInfo because the directory does not store the password, just a pointer to the proper Password Server and user ID. The Password Server database is a private root-readable file, and the contents are encrypted. Passwords are not accessible over the network for reading—they can only be verified.

**Authentication Manager** is supported for upgrades from Mac OS X Server version 10.1. Existing users will continue to use Authentication Manager. (If you export from Mac OS X Server and reimport, you do not get the `tim_password` set. You must manually set the password for each user after import.) You can enable Authentication Manager from the command line. Use Basic password validation. You should set Authentication Manager passwords on the server hosting the domain you are editing.

Note: Authentication Manager is only supported with NetInfo.

#### Setting Up Windows Services

You set up Windows services by configuring four groups of settings:
- **General**: Specify your computer name and workgroup name, and choose the role of the server in associated Windows domains.
- **Access**: Limit the number of clients and control guest access.
- **Logging**: Choose how much information is recorded in the service log.
- **Advanced**: Configure WINS registration and domain browsing services, choose a code page for clients, and control virtual share points for home directories.

Because the default settings work well in most cases, it may be that all you need to do is start the Windows service. Nonetheless, you should review the settings and change anything that isn’t appropriate for your network. Each setting is described in the following sections on configuration. Following the configuration tasks, other topics tell you how to start up Windows services.

##### Changing General Settings

You can use the **General** pane of the Windows service settings in **Server Admin** to provide a server description, name, and workgroup and specify the server’s role in its domain.

To configure Windows service General settings:

1. Open **Server Admin** and select **Windows** in the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**, then click **General**.
3. To specify how your server participates in the local domain, choose from the **Role** pop-up menu.
4. In the **Description** field, type a description that is meaningful to you or your users. This description appears in the **Network Neighborhood** window on client computers and is optional.
   - The description cannot exceed 48 characters.
5. In the **Computer Name** field, type the server name you want users to see when they connect.
   - The default name is the NetBIOS name of the Windows file server. The name should contain no more than 15 characters, and no special characters or punctuation.
   - If practical, make the server name match its unqualified DNS host name. For example, if your DNS server has an entry for your server as `server.apple.com`, give your server the name `server`.
6. In the **Workgroup** field, type the name of the workgroup that you want users to see in the **Network Neighborhood** window.
   - If you have Windows domains on your subnet, use one of them as the workgroup name to make it easier for clients to communicate across subnets. Otherwise, consult your Windows network administrator for the correct group name.
   - The workgroup name cannot exceed 15 characters.

#### From the Command Line

You can also change the Windows service settings by modifying the `serveradmin` command in Terminal. For more information, see the file services chapter of the command-line administration guide.

   - **Low**: Records errors and warning messages only.
   - **Medium**: Records error and warning messages, service start and stop times, authentication failures, and browser name registrations.
   - **High**: Records error and warning messages, service start and stop times, authentication failures, browser name registrations, and all file access.
4. Click **Save**.

#### From the Command Line

You can also change the Windows service settings using the `serveradmin` command in Terminal. For more information, see the file services chapter of the command-line administration guide.

##### Changing Advanced Settings

You can use the **Advanced** pane of the Windows service settings in **Server Admin** to choose a client code page, set the server to be a workgroup or domain master browser, specify the server’s WINS registration, and enable virtual share points for user homes.

To configure Windows services Advanced settings:

1. Open **Server Admin** and select **Windows** in the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**, then click **Advanced**.
3. Choose the character set you want clients to use from the **Code Page** pop-up menu.
4. Next to **Services**, choose whether to enable domain browsing services.
   - **Workgroup Master Browser**: Provides browsing and discovery of servers in a single subnet.
   - **Domain Master Browser**: Provides browsing and discovery of servers across subnets.
5. Next to **WINS Registration**, choose how you want the server to register with WINS.
   - **Off**: Prevents your server from registering itself with any external WINS server or local name resolution server.
   - **Enable WINS server**: Has the file server provide local name resolution services. This allows clients across multiple subnets to perform name/address resolution.
   - **Register with WINS server**: If your Windows clients and Windows server are not all on the same subnet, and your network has a WINS server. Then enter the IP address or DNS name of the WINS server.
6. To simplify setting up share points for Windows user home directories, select “Enable virtual share points.”
   - When you enable virtual share points, home directories are mounted automatically when Windows users log in to the server, without you having to set up individual share points for each of your users.

#### From the Command Line

You can also change the Windows service settings using the `serveradmin` command in Terminal. For more information, see the file services chapter of the command-line administration guide.
