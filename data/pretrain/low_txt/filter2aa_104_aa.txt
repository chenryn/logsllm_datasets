### 2. Flight of the Bumblebee
#### Take-off of the Project
- **What is a Quadrotor?**
  - Rigid structure
  - Multiple rotors
- **Video: First Flight**

**Challenges:**
- A quadrotor without smart electronic controls for attitude stabilization is likely to crash.
- The Flight Assistant system handles these complexities.

#### Basic Control
- **Video: Stabilization Algorithm**
- **Agility and Flight Dynamics**
  - Good flight dynamics
- **Limitations**
  - Requires an experienced R/C pilot
  - Sensitive to wind
  - Significant altitude variations

#### Advanced Control
- **Objective**: Make it flyable by anyone
  - Complete X, Y, Z control
- **Sensors Needed**
  - GPS sensor
  - Pressure sensor
  - Ultrasonic ranger system
  - Data fusion
- **Current Status**
  - Work in progress: Only Z-axis control, still sensitive to wind
  - Promising results

#### Ground Station
- **Critical Parameters Monitoring**
  - Security checklist
  - PID coefficients setup
  - Signal power monitoring
  - Battery monitoring
  - Status of every chip
  - Real-time position and attitude
- **Communications**

### 3. With Bird's Eyes
- **One for Fun**
- **Two for Stereo Vision**
- **Three for Headaches**

---

### 4. Taming of the Camera
- **Camera Integration and Control**

---

### 5. Views from Up There
- **Aerial Imagery and Surveillance Capabilities**

---

### 6. Flight Demo
- **Live Demonstration of the Quadrotor in Action**
