### After the Publication of SP800-90 in 2006

The first CMVP (Cryptographic Module Validation Program) certifications for SP800-90 were issued in 2008. However, between 2008 and 2016, 47% of FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) certificates were issued for X9.31.

Once a device is certified under the CMVP, it is added to a list of approved devices that U.S. federal agencies and other regulated entities may use.

### FIPS 140-2 Annex C: Approved Random Number Generators

FIPS 140-2 Annex C listed the ANSI X9.31 Random Number Generator with AES and three-key 3DES from January 31, 2005, until the most recent revision on January 4, 2016. Variants of the X9.17/X9.31 PRG (Pseudorandom Number Generator) using different block ciphers have been approved in FIPS and NIST standards since at least 1992. In January 2011, NIST deprecated the X9.31 PRG as part of a transition away from smaller key lengths and weaker cryptographic algorithms [7]. Currently, the only approved PRGs are from NIST SP 800-90A, which was updated in June 2015 to remove Dual EC DRBG.

### 3.2 Certified Unsafe Usage of the X9.31 PRG

We examined the security policy documents of all devices certified under the CMVP that documented previous or current use of the X9.31 PRG. NIST provides a historical list of implementations certified for random number generators [1]. A single FIPS validation certificate may cover multiple products and versions. The scope of these certificates varied: some validated a cryptographic module or a single product and version, while others covered entire product lines and operating systems.

According to this list, FIPS has issued 2,516 certificates in total for products that implemented X9.31. As of July 13, 2017, 997 of these certificates still listed current support for X9.31, despite its official deprecation in January 2016. The remaining certificates were available in updated versions that had removed details of historical X9.31 implementations. Of the 997 that indicated support for X9.31, 682 certificates from 288 vendors were validated for random number generation.

The security policy documents each contain a list of Critical Security Parameters (CSPs), including access control, key and parameter generation, and zeroization policies. We also looked for discussions elsewhere in the documentation regarding seed key generation. Out of the 288 vendors, 127 did not mention the AES key in the list of CSPs or elsewhere in the documentation. Since we could not determine whether the key was generated securely, we excluded these from further study. This left 161 vendors who mentioned seed key generation in some capacity.

We considered an X9.31 implementation secure if the documentation stated that the key and the seed were user-generated, the output of another random number generator, contained any discussion of specifying sufficient entropy for the seed key, or a strategy to generate keys uniquely per device or per boot. In the case of a user-generated key, the responsibility would fall on the user to ensure that the key is securely generated and rotated as necessary. We did not study these cases further. The largest class of devices we evaluated as safe generated the AES key on boot by seeding from a non-FIPS approved random number generator, most commonly the Linux random number generator.

For example, the InZero Gateway security policy states that the "PRNG is seeded from /dev/urandom...this provides the PRNG with 256 bits of entropy for the seed key" [2]. While urandom has had known vulnerabilities, we considered such usage safe for the purposes of this analysis. Another example is the 2012 FIPS 140-2 security policy for the Juniper SSG 140 [37], which was certified for the X9.31 generator, stating that for the "PRNG Seed and Seed Key," "Initial generation via entropy gathered from a variety of internal sources." There were 149 certificates (93% of the 161) in this class.

We counted an implementation as potentially vulnerable to a state recovery attack if the documentation stated that a single key was used for the lifetime of a device, particularly in cases where an external attacker could learn this key. Unsafe devices had documentation indicating that the AES key was stored statically in the firmware or flash memory and loaded at runtime into the PRG. There were 12 vendors in this class, covering 40 product lines. We list these products together with the language used to describe seed key generation in Table 2.

### 3.3 Device-Specific Analysis

We were able to gain access to the binary image for one of the products identified as potentially vulnerable, a Fortinet operating system. We provide more details on our investigation in the next section.

Cisco confirmed to us that X9.31 was used in Aironet 12.4-based branches for access points, Wireless Service Modules (WiSMs), and 4400 controllers using version 7.0. They were unable to locate the source code or confirm the use of a hardcoded key, although they agreed with our interpretation of the certification language. Cisco informed us that the 4400 controllers reached end of support in 2016, the WiSM modules in 2017, and the 12.4-based branch of Cisco IOS software that supported X9.31 reached end of support at an unknown date. Another family of access points used the 15.3 branch of IOS, which uses NIST 800-90 and not X9.31. Cisco no longer ships products using X9.31.

The BeCrypt Cryptographic Library Version 2.0 documentation states that the "RNG seed key" is "pre-loaded during the manufacturing process" and stored as "compiled in the binary." Version 3.0 of the BeCrypt library no longer includes the X9.31 PRG. BeCrypt stated to us that, except in one case, they do not recycle the strong entropy output from one usage to be the input to the next usage. Instead, they use fresh entropy. In the one case where they recycle the strong entropy input, the weak entropy input is actually strong entropy, and the key is generated programmatically at startup. Additionally, the fixed RNG key inside the FIPS module is for self-test purposes.

ViaSat’s FlagStone Core documentation states that the key was "injected during manufacture." The documentation does not specify whether this key is device-specific, although it recommends that "RNG Keys and Seeds that are imported into the FlagStone Core are generated or established using a FIPS 140-2 approved or a FIPS 140-2 allowed method." A device-specific key would require a targeted attack.

The certification documentation for Neopost devices specifies that the hardcoded key is entered in the factory and stored in tamper-proof memory. A device-specific hardcoded key stored in tamper-proof memory would be quite difficult to attack.

### 3.4 Open Source Implementations

We also examined the X9.31 implementations in OpenSSL and the Linux kernel but did not find evidence of hard-coded keys other than for testing.

### 4. Decrypting VPN Traffic on FortiOS v4.3

The FIPS certification for FortiOS 4.3 states that the X9.31 key is "generated external to the module." We reverse-engineered two versions of FortiOS and found that they used the same hard-coded key for their X9.31 implementation, which was then used as the system-wide random number generator.

We demonstrate that knowledge of this key allows an attacker to passively decrypt IPsec traffic from FortiOS v4. A PRG state recovery attack is feasible using only the IKE or TLS handshake nonces, and typically takes less than a second of computation time on our hardware. After the attack, the attacker can guess the secret keys used to generate encryption keys. We performed an Internet-wide scan for affected hosts and were able to carry out state recovery and private key recovery on handshakes from our scan data.

### 4.1 History of FortiOS 4.x

FortiOS is a network operating system created by Fortinet Inc. for their network security hardware devices and virtual appliances. In 2016, Fortinet was the fourth largest vendor by market share [3]. Fortigate primarily specializes in firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and VPN gateways. FortiOS is widely used across their product suite.

FortiOS 4.0, released on February 20, 2009, included the X9.31 PRG. It was also included in the final major FortiOS v4 version, 4.3, released on March 18, 2011. It was not included in FortiOS 5, released in November 2012. Prior to our disclosure of the PRG vulnerability in October 2016, the last release of FortiOS v4 was 4.3.18, released on August 6, 2014, with an end of support date of March 19, 2014, for devices compatible with FortiOS v5. In response to our disclosure of the random number generation vulnerability [5], Fortigate released version 4.3.19 of FortiOS in November 2016.

### 4.1.1 Vulnerabilities in FortiOS

On January 15, 2016, the MITRE corporation posted CVE-2016-1909 [4] revealing the presence of a hardcoded passphrase present in FortiOS 4.1.x and FortiOS 5.x as of October 2009, and all subsequent releases. This passphrase gave a remote attacker SSH access to the Fortimanager_Access account for remote administration. In a blog post in January 2016 [26], Fortinet stated that "This was not a 'backdoor' vulnerability issue but rather a management authentication issue... After careful analysis and investigation, we were able to verify this issue was not due to any malicious activity by any party, internal or external" and that the vulnerability had been patched in July 2014.

In August 2016, a group calling themselves "The Shadow Brokers" released a collection of malware tools and documentation purportedly from an actor they termed "The Equation Group." Among other things, the leak contained a remote code execution exploit for FortiOS v3 and v4 titled EGREGIOUSBLUNDER. The exploit included code to identify FortiOS versions using HTTP response headers. The collection also included a malware payload for FortiOS (codename BLATSTING), containing a module 'tadaqueous' that disables random number generation by hooking the function get_random_bytes, the entry point to FortiOS’s X9.31 implementation [57]. We did not find any evidence in the Shadow Brokers leak that The Equation Group was aware of the vulnerability we found in the PRG.

### 4.2 Static Analysis

We analyzed two implementations of FortiOS v4, the embedded operating system for Fortigate’s network devices. The first was a firmware dump from a FortiGate 100D Firewall, and the second was a 'virtual appliance' (VM) running a different build of the operating system. The two firmware images were nearly identical, with minor variations due to the lack of hardware in the virtual appliance and minor variations in supported TLS cipher suites. These differences would not have affected the measurements described in Section 5.

FortiOS is a GNU/Linux variant, with a customized shell that has kernel modules implementing hardware interfaces and cryptographic functions. The kernel is Linux 2.4.37, the last release of the 2.4.x series released in December 2008, which reached end of life in December 2011. FortiOS v5 still uses the Linux 2.4.37 kernel.

### 4.3 The X9.31 Implementation

The X9.31 random number generator is implemented within a kernel module that exports a Linux character device. At boot time, the init process loads the module and replaces /dev/urandom with a filesystem node corresponding to the X9.31 character device.

We reverse-engineered the kernel module providing the X9.31 implementation and found the hard-coded AES key used for the PRG. (See Appendix A for the reverse-engineered code.) The same key was used in both the firmware dump and virtual appliance. Although the documentation stated that the key was "generated external to the module," our findings indicate otherwise.
