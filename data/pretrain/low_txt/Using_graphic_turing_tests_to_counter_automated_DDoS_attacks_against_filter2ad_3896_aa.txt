## Abstract

We introduce WebSOS, a novel overlay-based architecture that ensures access to web servers under denial of service (DoS) attacks. Our approach leverages two key aspects of the web environment: its human-centric interface and the extensibility of modern browsers through downloadable "applets." WebSOS guarantees access for a large number of previously unknown users without requiring pre-existing trust relationships.

Our prototype requires no modifications to existing servers or browsers and utilizes graphical Turing tests, web proxies, and client authentication via SSL/TLS. We conducted a performance evaluation using PlanetLab, a testbed for network overlays, and determined the end-to-end latency using both Chord-based and shortcut extensions. The results show an increase in latency by a factor of 7 and 2, respectively, confirming our simulation findings.

## 1. Introduction

The web is increasingly used for various services and interactions, ranging from static content display to dynamic tasks such as email, banking, e-commerce, and real-time communication. The widespread availability of high-quality browsers and servers, along with user familiarity, ensures the continuous creation of new services.

However, this environment also presents a rich set of targets for motivated attackers. Many vulnerabilities and exploits have been identified in web servers, browsers, and applications. Traditional security measures focus on protecting the confidentiality and integrity of network connections, preventing server break-ins, and safeguarding client data. However, service availability in the presence of DoS and DDoS attacks has often been neglected.

Previous approaches to addressing DoS attacks are reactive, monitoring traffic at the target location and setting up filters once an attack is detected. These methods face challenges in accurately distinguishing legitimate traffic from DoS traffic and in robustly establishing filters deep within the network to minimize the attack's impact.

WebSOS, an adaptation of the Secure Overlay Services (SOS) architecture, aims to prevent congestion-based DDoS attacks from denying access to web servers. The key innovations in WebSOS are:
- The use of graphic Turing tests to distinguish between human users and automated attack scripts.
- Transparency to browsers and servers by leveraging browser extensibility.

In WebSOS, high-performance routers aggressively filter and block incoming connections from unapproved hosts, protecting the network segment around the targeted web servers. These routers are strategically placed (e.g., in an ISP’s Point of Presence) to mitigate the impact of attack traffic on legitimate traffic. Approved nodes, whose identities are kept secret, are selected from a distributed set of nodes forming a secure overlay. Traffic must pass a graphic Turing test at any entry point of the overlay before being securely tunneled to the target through the filtering routers.

WebSOS is the first instantiation of the SOS architecture. We evaluated its performance in both local and wide-area scenarios using the PlanetLab testbed. The results show an average increase in end-to-end latency by a factor of 2, which is an acceptable trade-off for ensuring service availability during attacks.

### 1.1 WebSOS Architectural Scope

DoS attacks can exhaust various resources, such as computational power or bandwidth, to deny service to other users. Link congestion attacks, where attackers flood pinch points in the network, are particularly damaging. WebSOS is designed to address these types of attacks. We do not consider more complex scenarios, such as physical network partitioning or algorithmic DoS attacks. We assume that attackers can exploit publicly available features but cannot infiltrate the security mechanisms that distinguish legitimate traffic from attack traffic.

### 1.2 Paper Organization

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
- Section 2 provides an overview of the Secure Overlay Services (SOS) and graphic Turing tests, and details the WebSOS architecture.
- Section 3 presents our simulation results using real ISP topologies.
- Section 4 describes our prototype implementation.
- Section 5 contains our performance evaluation.
- Section 6 discusses related work in DoS detection, prevention, and mitigation.
- Section 7 concludes the paper.

## 2. The WebSOS Architecture

### 2.1 Overview of SOS

The primary goal of the SOS infrastructure is to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized traffic. Authorized traffic is allowed to reach the destination, while unauthorized traffic is dropped or rate-limited. This requires a firewall deep in the network to perform access control using protocols like IPsec, which typically require authentication credentials. However, this precludes casual, anonymous access to web servers.

### 2.2 Graphic Turing Tests

Graphic Turing tests are used to authenticate human users and differentiate them from automated scripts. These tests are integrated into the WebSOS architecture to ensure that only legitimate human users can access the protected web servers.

### 2.3 WebSOS Architecture

WebSOS leverages the SOS architecture and introduces graphic Turing tests for human-to-overlay authentication. High-performance routers filter and block unapproved traffic, and approved nodes form a secure overlay. Traffic is validated at entry points and then securely tunneled to the target through the filtering routers.

## 3. Simulation Results

We present our simulation results using real ISP topologies. These simulations validate the effectiveness of the WebSOS mechanism in mitigating DDoS attacks and provide insights into the added latency introduced by the system.

## 4. Prototype Implementation

We describe the details of our prototype implementation, including the integration of graphic Turing tests, web proxies, and SSL/TLS for client authentication. The prototype is designed to be transparent to existing servers and browsers.

## 5. Performance Evaluation

We conducted a performance evaluation of the WebSOS prototype over the Internet using the PlanetLab testbed. The results show an average increase in end-to-end latency by a factor of 2, confirming our simulation findings.

## 6. Related Work

We discuss other work in DoS detection, prevention, and mitigation, highlighting the unique contributions of WebSOS and how it compares to existing solutions.

## 7. Conclusion

WebSOS is a novel overlay-based architecture that ensures access to web servers under DDoS attacks. By leveraging graphic Turing tests and browser extensibility, WebSOS provides a transparent and effective solution for mitigating DDoS attacks. Future work will explore further enhancements and address more sophisticated attack scenarios.
