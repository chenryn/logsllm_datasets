#### MFA Prevalence in Search Results
**Figure 7: MFA Prevalence in Top 10 Search Results**

The prevalence of MFA (Made for Advertisers) sites in the top 10 search results decreased following Google's announcement of changes to its ranking algorithm on February 24, 2011. These changes were designed to counter "low-quality" results.

**Monthly Revenue from Malware:**
\[ R_{\text{mal}}(1 \text{ month}) = 48975 \times 1 \times 0.0216 \times 58 \approx \$61,356 \]

Thus, malware sites, such as fake antivirus sites, generate approximately \$60,000 per month just from exploiting trending terms.

There are costs associated with deploying these sites, but server maintenance is significantly cheaper compared to MFA sites. This is because most machines hosting malware have been compromised rather than purchased. Bots can be acquired for less than a dollar [5, and references therein], while a compromised server (presumably with high-quality network access) costs at most \$25 according to Franklin et al. [9]. We do not adjust the returns on malware for the risk of being caught, as the likelihood of arrest for cyber-criminal activity is currently negligible in many jurisdictions where cyber-criminals operate.

**Conclusion:**
This analysis shows that malware and MFA hosting have different revenue models but yield similar amounts of money. This supports the hypothesis that they could be treated as substitutes.

### 5. SEARCH-ENGINE INTERVENTION

On February 24, 2011, following several high-profile reports of manipulation of its search engine (e.g., [33, 34]), Google announced changes to its search ranking algorithm aimed at eradicating "low-quality" results [35]. Google defined low-quality sites as those that "add little value for users, copy content from other websites, or are simply not very useful." The MFA sites examined in this paper fit this definition. Since we were already collecting search results for trending terms, we could measure the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing abuse targeting these terms.

**Figure 7:**
Plots the average percentage of top 10 search results marked as MFA for trending terms over time. From July to February, 3.1% of Google's top 10 results (solid line) for trending terms pointed to MFA sites, compared to 2.0% for Yahoo!'s top 10 results (dotted line). The vertical dashed line marks February 24, 2011, the day of Google's announcement. The proportion of MFA sites quickly fell, stabilizing at 0.47% for Google. Interestingly, Yahoo!'s share of top 10 MFA results also fell, to an average of 0.56%.

**Estimated Site Visits:**
Landing in the top results tells only part of the story. The underlying popularity of the trending terms is also important. We computed the estimated site visits to MFA sites, which is more directly tied to revenue. Table 6 compares the number of visits referred by Google and Yahoo! search results before and after the intervention. Between July 24, 2010, and February 24, 2011, MFA sites attracted an average of 4.67 million monthly visits. Between March 10 and April 24, 2011, the monthly rate fell by 31% to 3.2 million. However, the changes differed across search engines. Referrals from Google search results fell by 47%, while on Yahoo! and Bing, visits increased by 11%. The table also distinguishes between whether the MFA site uses Google ads or another provider. 81% of MFA sites show Google ads, which is not surprising given Google's dominance in pay-per-click advertising.

It is an open question whether Google might treat MFA sites hosting its own ads differently than sites with other ads. Striking them from the search results reduces Google's own advertising revenue. However, it is in Google's interest to provide high-quality search results. The amount of foregone revenue is small and likely to be partly replaced by other search results. Our figures support this rationale. Sites with Google ads fell by 1.2 million visits, or 41%. Visits to sites not using AdSense fell by 91%, but in absolute terms, the reduction was smaller than for sites with Google ads. By contrast, Yahoo! results with Google ads rose by 18%.

**Revenue Impact:**
Using the pre- and post-intervention MFA visit rates in the revenue equations developed in Section 4.2, the average monthly take for MFA sites has fallen from \$106,000 to \$74,000. If this reduction holds over time, what are the implications for miscreants? First, they may decide to devote more effort to manipulating Yahoo! and Bing, despite their lower market penetration, as MFA revenues are becoming more equitable in absolute terms. Second, malware becomes more attractive as an alternative source of revenue, so one unintended consequence of the intervention to improve search quality could be to foster more overtly criminal activities harming consumers. Third, revenue models based on advertising require volume, and external efforts that reduce traffic levels can cause significant pain to the miscreant. By contrast, malware offers substantially more expected revenue per visitor and is therefore likely to be much more difficult to eradicate.

**Statistical Significance:**
Given the striking change in MFA prevalence following Google's intervention, it is worth checking whether this intervention alters the significance of the empirical conclusions reached in Section 3.4. We included a dummy variable into the MFA regression reflecting whether Google's intervention had yet occurred and found that this inclusion does not alter the significance of the dependent variables presented in Section 3.4.

### 6. RELATED WORK

Our work contributes to the literature on understanding the underground online economy. Early econometric work in this domain includes studies on quantities bartered in underground forums [9] and email spam campaigns [18, 22]. Grier et al. [10] extend this literature to Twitter spam. Moore and Clayton have published a series of papers characterizing phishing campaigns [25, 26, 27].

More recently, several papers have started to investigate web-based scams. Christin et al. [6] study a specific web-based social engineering scam ("one click fraud"). Provos et al. describe in detail how "drive-by-downloads" are used to automatically install malware [30, 31]. Cova et al. [8] and Stone-Gross et al. [36] focus on fake anti-virus malware, providing estimates of the amount of money they generate. Stone-Gross et al. calculate, through recovery of the miscreants' transaction logs, that anti-virus campaigns gross between $3.8 and $48.4 million a year. Affiliates funneling traffic to miscreants get between $50,000 and $1.8 million in over two months. These totals are markedly higher than our findings, but they consider all possible sources of malware (botnets, search engine manipulation, drive-by-downloads), whereas we only look at the much smaller subset of search engine manipulation based on trending term exploitation.

A few recent works consider search engine manipulation. Leontiadis et al. [20] investigate search engine manipulation to promote potentially illicit online drugs. John et al. [17] present a case study of recent search engine manipulation campaigns, confirming that trending-term exploitation is a preferred attack vector. They then devise countermeasures to thwart search engine manipulation.

Our approach differs from related work in that we focus on a specific phenomenon—trending-term exploitation—by investigating how it is carried out (e.g., search-engine manipulation, Twitter spam) and its purpose: malware distribution and monetization through advertisements. Our analysis thus sheds light on a specific technique used by miscreants that search-engine operators are battling to fend off.

### 7. CONCLUSION

We have undertaken a large-scale investigation into the abuse of "trending" terms, focusing on the two primary methods of monetization: malware and ads. We found that the dynamic nature of trends creates a narrow opportunity that is effectively exploited on web search engines and social-media platforms. We presented statistical evidence that less popular and less financially lucrative terms are exploited most effectively, and the spoils of abuse are highly concentrated among a few players. We developed an empirically grounded model of the earnings potential of both malware and ads, finding that each attracts aggregate revenues on the order of \$100,000 per month. Finally, we found that Google's intervention to combat low-quality sites has likely reduced revenues from trend exploitation by more than 30%.

There is a connection in our economic modeling to the battle over how to profit from typosquatting [28]. In both cases, Internet "bottom feeders" seek to siphon off a fraction of legitimate traffic at a large scale. Several years ago, typosquatting was used in phishing attacks and to distribute malware. Today, however, typosquatting is almost exclusively monetized through pay-per-click and affiliate marketing ads [28], attracting hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising revenue to domain squatters via ad platforms.

The open question is whether a significant crackdown on, say, fake antivirus sales will simply shift the economics in favor of low-quality advertising. However, while ad platforms might tolerate placing ads on typosquatted websites, advertising that lowers the quality of search results directly threatens the ad platform’s core business of web search. Consequently, we are more optimistic that search engines might be willing to crack down on all abuses of trending terms, as we have found in our initial data analysis.
