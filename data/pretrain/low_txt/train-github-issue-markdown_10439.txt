The specification requires a "cut/copy/paste" toolbar that includes additional options for search, share, and translate. It is not clear from the spec whether these three extra options are fixed or if the application can choose which options to provide.

In any case, our current implementation does not support a `more` menu. We will need to add this feature, along with the appropriate transition animation.
