  - Sports Bar in Miami
  - Online Adult Toy Store
  - International VoIP Provider
  - U.S. Defense Contractor
- **Malware Developers' Improvements**:
  - Many enhancements to avoid detection
  - Possible influence from last year's Freakshow

## What’s a Malware Freakshow?
- **Access to Breached Environments**: These environments contain valuable data
- **Smash and Grab is Outdated**: Hackers spend an average of 156 days before getting caught
- **Time for Exploration and Development**: Custom and targeted malware is now the norm
- **Gathering and Analyzing Malware**:
  - **Demo**: Showcases malware samples to the security community
  - **Benefit**: Learn about the sophistication of current threats
  - **Goal**: Rethink our alert and defense strategies

## Anatomy of a Successful Malware Attack
- **Methodical Approach**:
  1. **Identifying the Target**
  2. **Developing the Malware**
  3. **Infiltrating the Victim**
  4. **Finding the Data**
  5. **Getting the Loot Out**
  6. **Covering Tracks and Obfuscation (Optional)**

### Step 1: Identifying the Target
- **Target Data Leading to Money**:
  - **Credit Card Data**:
    - Exists in plain text in many environments
    - Cash is just 4 hops away: [Track Data] → [Fake Card] → [Fraud] → [Sale of Goods] → [Cash]
  - **ATM/Debit Card Data**:
    - Limited to ATM networks and places accepting debit
    - Requires PIN
    - Cash is just 3 hops away: [Track Data + PIN] → [Fake Card] → [ATM Machine] → [Cash]

### Step 2: Developing the Malware
- **Focus on the Big Three**:
  - Keystroke Logger
  - Network Sniffer
  - Memory Dumper
- **Design Considerations**:
  - **Naming Convention**: Avoid obvious names like `blabla.exe`; use common system names like `svchost.exe`
  - **Functionality**: Slow and steady wins the race
  - **Persistency and Data Storage**

### Step 3: Infiltrating the Victim
- **Basic Methods**:
  - **Physical Way**: Social engineering
  - **Easy Way**: Exploiting default passwords and remote access (RDP)
  - **Über Way**: Using zero-day vulnerabilities

### Step 4: Finding the Data
- **Software Secrets**:
  - **Task Manager**: Busy processes indicate data processing
  - **Process Folders**: Temp files may contain sensitive data
  - **Configuration Files**: Debug mode set to ON indicates vulnerabilities
  - **Network Traffic**: Local network traffic often in clear text

### Step 5: Getting the Loot Out
- **Keep It Simple**:
  - Use common protocols (FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP)
  - Avoid using suspicious high ports

### Step 6: Covering Tracks and Obfuscation
- **Avoid Clumsiness**:
  - Test the malware first
  - Avoid crashing systems, filling up disk space, or showing command prompts
- **Mess with the Cops**:
  - Match MAC times to system install dates
  - Slightly obfuscate output files
  - Automate but randomize events
  - Use rootkits
