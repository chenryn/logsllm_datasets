### September 1, 2015: Natural Variability in Trackers

**Table 1: Natural Variability in Trackers Observed on Different Visits to the Alexa Top 100 in 2015**

| Metric | August 25th | September 1st | Difference |
|--------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Vanilla Trackers | 301 | 308 | 7 (6%) |

**Observations:**
- The variability in the number of trackers observed can result from non-static webpage content, such as ad auctions that produce different winners.

### 4.1 Lesson (Challenge): The Wayback Machine Provides a Partial View of Third-Party Requests

**Key Question:**
- How complete is the Wayback Machine's view of the past, both for top-level pages and embedded content?

**Exploration:**
- We investigate the differences between live and Wayback measurements and quantify the effects of various factors.
- **Variation Between Visits:**
  - Different trackers and third parties may appear on a site during subsequent visits, even if these views are close together.
  - Example: Disparity in tracking behaviors between ads in an ad network.
  - **Estimation:**
    - We compare three live runs from August-September 2015 of the Alexa top 100 sites.
    - Variation between runs, even a week apart, is notable but not enough to account for all differences between Wayback and live datasets.
    - For the number of Vanilla trackers, the August 25th and September 1st runs vary by 7 trackers, or 6%.

- **Non-Archived and Blocked Requests:**
  - **Robots.txt Exclusions (403 errors):**
    - If a domain's `robots.txt` file restricts crawling, the Wayback Machine will not archive the response.
    - **Impact:**
      - Small fraction of requests, unique URLs, and domains are affected by `robots.txt` exclusions.
      - Common for popular trackers: 60% of the top 20 trackers in the 2015 live dataset are blocked at least once by `robots.txt` in the 2015 Wayback measurement.
  - **Other Failures to Archive (404 errors):**
    - The Wayback Machine may fail to archive resources due to various reasons, such as unavailability of the domain or changes in the Wayback Machine’s crawler.
    - **Impact:**
      - Missing archives are rare.
  - **URL Rewriting Failures (Wayback “Escapes”):**
    - The Wayback Machine attempts to statically extract URLs from HTML and JavaScript to find additional sites to archive.
    - **Impact:**
      - Dynamically generated URLs may not be properly redirected to their archived versions, causing the page to attempt to make a request to the live web.
      - 16.1% of all requests attempted to "escape" and were blocked by TrackingExcavator.
  - **Inconsistent Timestamps:**
    - Embedded resources in a web page archived by the Wayback Machine may have timestamps far from the timestamp of the top-level page.
    - **Impact:**
      - Responses with timestamps more than six months away are ignored.

- **Cascading Failures:**
  - Non-archived responses or blocked requests can lead to the omission of subsequent requests or cookie-setting events.
  - **Impact:**
    - To study the effect of cascading failures, we must compare archival and live runs from the same time.

### 4.2 Lesson (Opportunity): Consider All Third-Party Requests, in Addition to Confirmed Trackers

- **Analysis:**
  - We evaluate the Wayback Machine’s view of third-party requests within an archival measurement.
  - **Conclusion:**
    - Many trackers confirmed in the live dataset appear as simple third-party requests in the Wayback data.
    - A non-trivial fraction of trackers are missing entirely from the archive.
    - To study third-party web tracking in the past, we must consider all third-party requests, not only those confirmed as trackers according to the taxonomy.

### 4.3 Lesson (Opportunity): The Wayback Machine’s Data Allows Us to Study Trends Over Time

- **Comparison:**
  - We compare live datasets (2011, 2013, 2015, and 2016) to their Wayback counterparts.
  - **Conclusion:**
    - The Wayback Machine’s data reveals genuine historical trends.
    - Although confirmed trackers in "Wayback mode" underrepresent the number of confirmed trackers found on the live web, the trends over time are comparable in both sets of measurements.
    - We see an upward trend in tracking behaviors since 1996, which corresponds with our intuition.

### 4.4 Lesson (Opportunity): Popular Trackers Are Represented in the Wayback Machine’s Data

- **Findings:**
  - 100% of the top 20 trackers from the live dataset are represented as either confirmed trackers or other third parties in the Wayback data.
  - More popular trackers are better represented in Wayback data: 75% of the top 100 live trackers, compared to 53% of all live trackers.

### 4.5 Lesson (Opportunity): The Wayback Machine Provides Additional Data Beyond Requests

- **Additional Data:**
  - The Wayback Machine provides and TrackingExcavator collects additional data related to web tracking behaviors, such as the use of various JavaScript APIs.
  - **Example:**
    - We observe uses of `navigator.userAgent` as early as 1997.

### 4.6 Summary

- **Summary:**
  - The Wayback Machine’s view of the past is incomplete, particularly affecting third-party requests critical for evaluating web tracking over time.
  - We identified and quantified these weaknesses and introduced findings and strategies to mitigate them, including considering third-party requests, manually labeling known popular trackers, and studying general trends over time instead of raw numbers.

### 5. Historical Web Tracking Measurements

- **Datasets:**
  - We focus on the most popular websites each year from 1996 to 2016.
  - **Sources:**
    - 2003-2016: Alexa
    - 1996-2002: Popular Links from Homepages

- **Prevalence of Tracking Behaviors Over Time:**
  - **Figure 4: Evolution of Tracker Types Over Time**
    - Shows the total number of unique trackers observed over time and the prevalence of different tracking behavior types.
    - **Note:**
      - Trackers may exhibit more than one behavior, so the sum of the lines may be greater than the height of the bar.
      - The large bars in 2015 and 2016 may reflect changes in tracking prevalence and the Wayback Machine's archiving process.
