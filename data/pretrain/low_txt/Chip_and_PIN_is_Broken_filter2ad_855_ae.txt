### Protocol Framework and Issuer Checks

We argue that for a protocol specification to be considered valid, it must include explicit statements of the checks that each party must perform on the protocol messages. In the absence of named specification authors who accept responsibility, it is reasonable to attribute responsibility to the "Chip and PIN" system, which, after all, is a marketing term encompassing an entire stack of specifications.

### Conclusion

We have demonstrated that the PIN verification feature of the EMV protocol is flawed. The lack of authentication for the PIN verification response, combined with an ambiguity in the encoding of the cardholder verification result in the Transaction Verification Results (TVR), allows an attacker with a man-in-the-middle position to use a card without the correct PIN. This attack can be used to make fraudulent purchases with a stolen card. We have shown that the live banking network is vulnerable by successfully conducting transactions with incorrect PINs at major UK banks and foreign banks. The transaction records falsely indicate that the PIN was verified, and the funds were indeed withdrawn from the account.

Such attacks could explain many instances where a card has allegedly been used with the correct PIN, despite the cardholder's insistence that they did not disclose it. Banks have refused to refund such victims, claiming that a card cannot be used without the correct PIN. This paper demonstrates that this claim is false.

We have discussed how this protocol flaw has remained undetected: the public specifications are complex and fail to specify critical security details. We have also proposed ways in which issuer banks can fix this vulnerability while maintaining backward compatibility with existing systems. However, it is clear that the EMV framework is seriously flawed. Rather than leaving member banks to patch each successive vulnerability, the EMV consortium must start planning a redesign and an orderly migration to the next version. In the meantime, the EMV protocol should be considered broken. We recommend that the Federal Reserve resist pressure from banks to allow its deployment in the USA until it is fixed.

### Appendix: Transaction Log of MITM Attack

The following log was collected during one of our man-in-the-middle experiments, where we used one of our own cards to make an online Chip and PIN transaction with an incorrect PIN. Data items that could identify the merchant have been redacted (xx), and unnecessary details have been removed for brevity (. . . ). Principals are Terminal (T), Card (C), and man-in-the-middle (M).
