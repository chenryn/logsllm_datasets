### Issue Description
In the current Apache Airflow documentation for the Tableau connector, token-based authentication is marked as deprecated. However, since the enforcement of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on April 27, 2023, it has become impossible to authenticate using a username and password for service accounts.

### Proposed Solution
To address this issue, we should:
1. Mark username/password authentication as deprecated (or consider removing it entirely).
2. Strongly recommend the use of access token authentication.
