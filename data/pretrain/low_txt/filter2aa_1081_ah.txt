# Test 10, Part 2: 60 Numbered JPG Files, One Deleted per Minute Over an Hour, Quick Format

## Procedure
- A quick format of all drives from the previous test was performed using the evidence creation machine via eSATA.
- Drives were immediately safely removed from the system and imaged using a forensic write-blocker.
- File carving was run across each drive image to determine if any of the image files were still recoverable.

## Results
- After the quick format, all files were unrecoverable on the SSDs where the deleted file was unrecoverable or damaged during the previous test (Crucial, Intel, Samsung).
- With the exception of a single file on the SuperTalent SSD, all files were recoverable from the other SSDs and the control hard drive.

- **Seagate HD**: All files recoverable.
- **Crucial SSD**: No files recoverable.
- **Intel SSD**: No files recoverable.
- **OCZ SSD**: All files recoverable.
- **Patriot SSD**: All files recoverable.
- **Samsung SSD**: No files recoverable.
- **SuperTalent SSD**: All files but #37 were recoverable.

# Test 11, Part 1: 60 Numbered JPG Files, One Deleted per Minute Over an Hour, TRIM Disabled

## Procedure
- This was the second of several tests designed to observe the behavior of solid state drives as files are deleted over a period of time.
- The test was identical to the previous one, with the exception that TRIM was disabled in the operating system.
- The same PowerShell script was used to delete one image at a time sequentially every minute over the course of an hour.
- All JPG files were saved to each drive using the evidence creation machine via eSATA.
- Once these files were copied to each drive, the drive was unmounted to ensure that the files were written to disk.
- The disk was then remounted, and the script was executed, allowing each image file to be deleted.
- Once the script completed execution, the drive was immediately unmounted and connected to the write-blocker on the evidence collection machine and imaged.
- The image was then investigated to determine which deleted image files were recoverable.

## Results
- The image was completely recoverable on all of the SSDs. The results of these tests demonstrate the importance of the TRIM command with respect to automatic garbage collection.

- **Seagate HD**: All files were recoverable, #1 required file carving.
- **Crucial SSD**: All files recoverable.
- **Intel SSD**: All files recoverable.
- **OCZ SSD**: Drive failed, unable to complete test.
- **Patriot SSD**: All files were recoverable, #1 required file carving.
- **Samsung SSD**: All files recoverable.
- **SuperTalent SSD**: All files were recoverable, 1-6 required file carving, 7-60 normally.

# Test 11, Part 2: 60 Numbered JPG Files, One Deleted per Minute Over an Hour, TRIM Disabled, Quick Format

## Procedure
- A quick format of all drives from the previous test was performed using the evidence creation machine via eSATA.
- Drives were immediately safely removed from the system and imaged using a forensic write-blocker.
- File carving was run across each drive image to determine if any of the image files were still recoverable.

## Results
- After the quick format, files were unrecoverable on half of the SSDs (Crucial, Intel, Samsung) and recoverable on the remaining SSDs and control hard drive (Seagate, Patriot, and SuperTalent).
- While the OCZ SSD was unable to complete this test, based on the results of previous tests, we can predict that this SSD would have behaved similarly to the Patriot SSD.
- This test clearly shows the impact of the TRIM command and also the impact of different manufacturer’s firmware implementations.

- **Seagate HD**: All files recoverable.
- **Crucial SSD**: No files recoverable.
- **Intel SSD**: No files recoverable.
- **OCZ SSD**: Drive failed, unable to complete test.
- **Patriot SSD**: All files recoverable.
- **Samsung SSD**: No files recoverable.
- **SuperTalent SSD**: All files but #1 recoverable.

# Test 12, Part 1: 60 Numbered JPG Files, One Deleted per Minute Over an Hour, USB Connection

## Procedure
- This was the third of several tests designed to observe the behavior of solid state drives as files are deleted over a period of time.
- The test was identical to the previous one, with the exception that TRIM was enabled in the operating system and the drive was connected via USB instead of eSATA.
- The same PowerShell script was used to delete one image at a time sequentially every minute over the course of an hour.
- All JPG files were saved to each drive using the evidence creation machine via USB.
- Once these files were copied to each drive, the drive was unmounted to ensure that the files were written to disk.
- The disk was then remounted, and the script was executed, allowing each image file to be deleted.
- Once the script completed execution, the drive was immediately unmounted and connected to the write-blocker on the evidence collection machine and imaged.
- The image was then investigated to determine which deleted image files were recoverable.

## Results
- The image was completely recoverable on all of the functioning SSDs. The results of these tests further demonstrate the importance of the TRIM command with respect to automatic garbage collection.

- **Seagate HD**: All files recoverable.
- **Crucial SSD**: All files recoverable.
- **Intel SSD**: All files recoverable.
- **OCZ SSD**: Drive failed, unable to complete test.
- **Patriot SSD**: All files recoverable.
- **Samsung SSD**: All files recoverable.
- **SuperTalent SSD**: All files were recoverable, 1 required file carving, 2-60 normally.

# Observations and Analysis

Overall, there were a number of differences in the behavior of the solid state drives when compared to the control standard hard drive. Additionally, the behavior of the solid state drives was not necessarily consistent between drive models and manufacturers across each individual test. However, there were several consistent patterns observed across each SSD model. In general, SSDs were observed to behave differently than standard drives in many tests, but the scope and magnitude of these differences varied across drive manufacturers and models.

### Figure 7: Overall Recoverability of Files Across All Tests, Per Drive

As seen in the graph, the success of recovering data varied significantly depending on the drive being tested. Some of the SSDs performed nearly identically to the control hard drive, whereas others demonstrated a significant decrease in the likelihood of data being successfully recovered.

### Figure 8: Overall Recoverability of Files Across Deletion Tests, Per Drive

For file deletion tests, the behavior of two of the SSDs was identical to the control hard drive—files were recoverable in all tests. The OCZ SSD behaved similarly to these SSDs as well during all of the tests where it was functional. Two SSDs had unrecoverable files in a few of the tests, and the remaining two SSDs only allowed for data to be recovered in around 50% of the tests.
