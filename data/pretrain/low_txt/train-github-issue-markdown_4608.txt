### Description

It would be beneficial to have the circles detected by the `HoughCircles` function sorted by their accumulator values. Currently, the output does not provide any indication of which circle is the most significant.

> Hi, I'm new to OpenCV but recently looked at the `hough.cpp` file. The `icvHoughCirclesGradient` function (and hence the output of the `HoughCircles` function) already returns circles sorted by the highest accumulated values based on the circle centers with the highest votes from surrounding non-negative edge pixels (line 865). The confusion might arise in the second phase of the function when trying to find the best-supported radius (around line 945). You can sort the circles according to the 'max_count' of supporting radius pixels, but this approach may not yield good results, especially for larger circles, as they tend to have more support.
