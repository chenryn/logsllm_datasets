## Abstract
A wide range of research areas, including Internet measurement, privacy, and network security, rely on lists of target domains for analysis. These lists, such as the popular Alexa list of one million domains, are widely used in research. However, the soundness of these top lists has rarely been questioned by the community. Little is known about their creation, representativeness, potential biases, stability, or overlap between different lists.

In this study, we survey the extent, nature, and evolution of top lists used by research communities. We assess the structure and stability of these lists and demonstrate that rank manipulation is possible for some lists. We also reproduce the results of several scientific studies to evaluate the impact of using a top list, which specific list, and the date of list creation. Our findings indicate that:
1. Top lists generally overestimate results compared to the general population by a significant margin, often even an order of magnitude.
2. Some top lists exhibit surprising change characteristics, leading to high day-to-day fluctuation and result instability.

We conclude with specific recommendations for the use of top lists and how to interpret results based on them with caution.

## Introduction
Scientific studies frequently use samples of DNS domain names for various purposes, such as conducting lexical analysis, measuring properties of domains, or testing new algorithms on real domains. Internet top lists, like the Alexa or Cisco Umbrella Top 1M lists, provide a reputedly representative sample of popular Internet domains. These lists can be created using different methods and data sources, resulting in different sets of domains.

The prevalence and opacity of these lists could introduce an unchecked bias in scientific research. For instance, in 2017 alone, we found 69 publications across 10 networking venues that used a top list. The curators of such lists often conceal the data sources and ranking mechanisms, which are typically seen as proprietary business assets in the search engine optimization (SEO) space. This leaves researchers with little to no information about the content, stability, biases, evolution, and representativeness of these lists.

In this work, we analyze three popular top lists—Alexa Global, Cisco Umbrella, and Majestic Million—and discuss the following characteristics:
- **Significance**: We survey 687 networking-related papers published in 2017 to investigate the use of Internet top lists. We find that 69 papers (10.0%) use at least one top list.
- **Structure**: We examine domain properties in different top lists, such as the presence of invalid top-level domains (TLDs), low intersections between various lists (<30%), and classifications of disjoint domains.
- **Stability**: We conduct in-depth longitudinal analyses of top list stability, revealing daily churn of up to 50% of domains.
- **Ranking Mechanisms**: Through controlled experiments and reverse engineering, we shed light on the ranking mechanisms of different top lists. In one experiment, we placed an unused test domain at a 22k rank in the Umbrella list.
- **Research Result Impact**: We run several experiments against top lists and the general population of all com/net/org domains to show the inherent bias in any given target list. We find that top lists significantly exaggerate results and that results depend on the day of the week the list was obtained.

We discuss related work and provide specific recommendations in Section 9. Throughout our work, we adhere to the highest ethical standards and aim for full reproducibility. We share code, data, and additional insights at [https://toplists.github.io](https://toplists.github.io).

## Significance of Top Lists
Scientific literature often uses one or more of the top lists outlined in Section 2. To better understand how often and for what purpose top lists are used, we surveyed 687 recent publications.

## Domain Top Lists
This section provides an overview of various domain top lists and their creation processes. Each of these lists is updated daily.

### Alexa
The most popular and widely used top list is the Alexa Global Top 1M list. It is generated based on web activity monitored by the Alexa browser plugin, "directly measured sources," and "over 25,000 different browser extensions" over the past three months from "millions of people." No information exists on the plugin's user base, raising questions about potential biases in terms of geography or age. Alexa lists are generally offered for sale, with few free offerings. The Global Top 1M list is the most popular free offering, available without an explicit license, and was briefly suspended in late 2016.

### Cisco Umbrella
Another popular top list is the Cisco Umbrella 1M, launched in mid-December 2016. This list contains the Top 1M domains (including subdomains) as seen by Cisco’s OpenDNS service. This DNS-based nature is fundamentally different from collecting website visits or links. Hence, the Umbrella list includes Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) for any kind of Internet service, not just websites. It is provided "free of charge" without an explicit license.

### Majestic
The third top list is the Majestic Million, released in October 2012. This Creative Commons licensed list is based on Majestic’s web crawler. It ranks sites by the number of /24 IPv4-subnets linking to that site. While the Majestic list is not widely used in research, we include it in our study for its orthogonal mechanism, open license, and availability for several years.

### Other Top Lists
There are other top lists available, but they are little used, inconsistently available, or fluctuate in size. For example, Quantcast provides a list of the Top 1M most frequently visited websites per country, measured through their web intelligence plugin. Only the US-based list can be downloaded; all other lists can only be viewed online and show ranks only when paid. The Statvoo list provides an API and a download for their Top 1M sites but has frequently been inaccessible. The Chrome UX report publishes telemetry data about domains popular with Chrome users but does not rank domains or provide a static-sized set of domains. We also exclude the SimilarWeb Top Sites ranking as it is not freely available and is little used in science.

## Methodology
We surveyed papers published at 10 network-related venues in 2017, listed in Table 1. First, we searched the 687 papers for keywords in an automated manner. Next, we manually inspected matching papers to remove false positives (e.g., Amazon’s Alexa home assistant, or an author named Alexander) or papers that mention the lists without actually using them. Finally, we reviewed the remaining 69 papers (10.0%) that used a top list, focusing on the top lists used, the nature of the study, the technologies measured, whether the study was dependent on the list, and whether the study was replicable.

Table 1 provides an overview of the results. We find that the field of Internet measurement is most reliant on top lists, used in 22.2% of the surveyed papers. Other fields also use top lists frequently, such as security (8.5%), systems (6.4%), and web technology (7.9%).

### Top Lists Used
We first investigated which lists and subsets of lists are typically used. Table 1 provides an overview of the lists used in the studies we identified. We find that 29 studies used the full Alexa Global Top 1M, the most common choice among inspected publications, followed by a variety of Alexa Top 1M subsets (e.g., Top 10k). All papers except one used a list collated by Alexa. One paper used the Umbrella Top 100 list to assess the importance of ASes showing BGP bursts. No paper in our study used the Majestic list.

A study may use multiple distinct subsets of a list. For example, one study used the Alexa Global Top 1k, 10K, 500K, and Top 1M at different stages. We count these as distinct use-cases in Table 1. We also find that 59 studies exclusively used Alexa as a source for domain names. Ten papers used lists from more than one origin; one paper used the Alexa Global Top 1M, the Umbrella Top 1M, and various DNS zone files as sources. In total, two studies used the Cisco Umbrella Top 1M.

Category and country-specific lists are also used. Eight studies used country-specific lists from Alexa, usually choosing only one country; one study selected 138 countries. Category-based lists are rarer, with two studies using category subsets.

### Characterization of Studies
To show that top lists are used for various types of studies, we looked at the range of topics covered and technologies measured in the surveyed papers. For each paper, we assigned a broad purpose and the network layer in focus.

**Purposes:** For all papers, we reviewed the broad area of study. The largest category encompasses various aspects of Internet measurement, followed by security, systems, and web technology.
