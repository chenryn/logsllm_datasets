### Abstract
Facebook is the largest social media platform, with over one billion active monthly users. The extensive sharing of personal and sensitive data makes it a prime target for phishing attacks. These attacks often exploit users' lack of security knowledge, using fake or compromised accounts to share malicious posts. Such attacks may evade Facebook's defense systems, exposing users to potential phishing, drive-by downloads, and malware. To date, few studies have explored how users interact with such attacks on Facebook. In our prior work, we used a simulated interface and think-aloud protocol to study this issue. This current study aims to further understand the factors influencing users' decisions to click on potentially malicious posts through a vignette study that presents realistic scenarios.

### 1. Introduction
Social media platforms like Facebook are integral to the lives of billions of people. However, many users lack the awareness and skills to use these sites securely. Recently, there has been an increase in phishing attacks on social media, often using fake or compromised accounts. In social media, attackers can exploit the personal information shared by users to carry out targeted attacks, which are more successful and harder to detect by both current defense systems and users.

To date, little research has focused on understanding the efficacy of attackers' strategies in carrying out phishing attacks on social media. This is crucial for improving both defense mechanisms and user awareness. Our previous work [12] used an interface prototype and a think-aloud protocol to study users' clicking behavior. The prototype resembled the Facebook newsfeed interface, with placeholders to remove personal bias and labels indicating the relationship between the user and the post author.

This study builds on our previous work, addressing feedback about the artificiality and unfamiliarity of the simulated interface. We used a vignette study, presenting participants with verbal details and asking them to imagine the corresponding scenarios. This approach allowed us to explore a wider range of scenarios, contributing to a deeper understanding of users' clicking behavior in social media.

### 2. Related Work: Phishing in Social Media
Phishing in email has a low success rate, with only 3% of users clicking on links [14]. In contrast, 25% of users on social media click on malicious links [8]. Several factors contribute to the higher success rates of phishing attacks on social media:

- **Personal Information Exposure**: Attackers can exploit the personal information shared by users, especially if they become friends with the victim or use a compromised account [1].
- **Usage Patterns**: Some Facebook users gain gratification from social surfing, finding more information about others, or expanding their social network [6]. By filling out profile information and adjusting privacy settings, users provide more information to attackers.
- **Profile Completeness and Friend Count**: There is a correlation between the completeness of profile details and the number of online friends [7], making users with more complete profiles and larger friend counts more vulnerable.
- **Receptivity to New Connections**: Users who frequently accept new friend requests and messages are more likely to be deceived by attackers posing as legitimate users [15, 11, 2].

Despite these factors, there is limited research on how users treat links from fake accounts compared to those from known connections, and whether users look for indicators of compromised accounts or fake posts.

### 3. Methodology
We conducted a vignette study in a lab setting, approved by the Institutional Review Board at Rochester Institute of Technology. Participants completed a survey hosted on the Qualtrics platform after agreeing to the informed consent document.

In contrast to our previous work [12], this study used vignettes to investigate users' clicking behavior in different scenarios. Each vignette presented a unique combination of variables:
- **Relationship**: Spouse/Partner, Close Friend, Acquaintance, Public Page
- **Post Location**: Participant’s wall, Post author’s wall (participant tagged), Post author’s wall (participant not tagged), Participant’s messenger inbox
- **Type of Post**: Interactive (e.g., quizzes), Sales-Oriented, Media

We created 48 different vignettes considering all combinations of values for the variables. To avoid participant fatigue, each participant was randomly assigned two of the four relationships, resulting in 24 individual vignettes per participant. For each relationship, participants provided a pseudonym and some information about the person’s Facebook usage behavior. For example, if a participant provided a pseudonym of "Tom" for her Spouse, a vignette might read: "Scenario 1: Tom has shared a post on your wall. It’s an interactive post (e.g., quizzes, games)."

Participants were then asked about the frequency of encountering such scenarios in real life and their likelihood of clicking on the post.
