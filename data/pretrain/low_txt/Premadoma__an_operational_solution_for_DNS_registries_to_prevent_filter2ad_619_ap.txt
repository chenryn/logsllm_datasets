ance and blacklist incompleteness. PREDATOR and Premadoma operate with very different feature sets (as shown in Table 1) and make use of very different classifiers. According to a survey of detection techniques by Kidmose et al. [13], only very few detection methods use registrant data (neither does PREDATOR). Yet, as can be seen from Figure 4, the registrant-related features (in green), actually exhibit the highest information gain.
Unfortunately, though, at this time, a fair performance comparison between PREDATOR and Premadoma is not feasible, given 5The WHOIS privacy service for GDPR compliance that is active for individuals who register .eu domain names is implemented by the .eu TLD itself.

Despite the issues of blacklists being incomplete, PREDATOR and Premadoma utilize significantly different feature sets (as illustrated in Table 1) and employ distinct classification methods. A survey of detection techniques by Kidmose et al. [13] indicates that only a few detection methods incorporate registrant data, and PREDATOR is not among them. However, as depicted in Figure 4, the registrant-related features (highlighted in green) demonstrate the highest information gain.

Unfortunately, a fair performance comparison between PREDATOR and Premadoma is currently unfeasible. This is due to the implementation of the WHOIS privacy service for GDPR compliance, which is active for individuals registering .eu domain names and is managed by the .eu top-level domain (TLD) itself.
