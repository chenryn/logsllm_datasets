**Title: Cryptographic Primitives for Building Secure and Privacy-Respecting Protocols**

**Author: Jan Camenisch**

**Abstract:**

The widespread use of the Internet and other electronic media for daily tasks has led to the frequent exchange, processing, and storage of sensitive information at various locations. Once this information is released, controlling its dissemination becomes nearly impossible. Furthermore, news reports frequently highlight incidents where sensitive data has been lost, stolen, or misused, often involving large and reputable organizations. Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) can help minimize the amount of information that needs to be revealed in transactions and limit its dispersion. Many of these PETs rely on common cryptographic primitives that enable data authentication and encryption while allowing efficient proofs of possession and properties of the data without revealing the data itself or any side information.

In this talk, we will first explore several example scenarios to illustrate the need for such cryptographic building blocks. We will then present and discuss these primitives, starting with efficient discrete logarithm-based proof protocols, commonly known as generalized Schnorr proofs. These proofs allow one to demonstrate knowledge of different discrete logarithms (exponents) and their relationships. For generalized Schnorr proofs to be used effectively, it is necessary that the signature and the message signed are exponents and that no hash function is employed in the signature verification. Similarly, for encryption schemes, the plaintext must be an exponent. We will present and discuss several such signature and encryption schemes.

To showcase the power of these building blocks, we will examine a few example protocols, such as anonymous access control and anonymous polling. The talk will conclude with a discussion on security definitions and proofs. We hope that the presented building blocks will facilitate the development of many new privacy-preserving protocols and applications in the future.
