### Summary of the Court's Decision

Accordingly, we hold that Blizzard’s claim for tortious interference under Arizona law is not preempted by the Copyright Act. However, we vacate the grant of summary judgment due to the presence of outstanding issues of material fact.

### Personal Liability of Donnelly

The district court determined that Donnelly was personally liable for MDY’s tortious interference with contract, secondary copyright infringement, and DMCA violations. We vacate this decision because we have determined that MDY is not liable for secondary copyright infringement and is only liable under the DMCA for violating § 1201(a)(2) with respect to WoW’s dynamic non-literal elements. Additionally, we conclude that summary judgment is inappropriate for Blizzard’s claim for tortious interference with contract under Arizona law. Therefore, on remand, the district court shall reconsider the issue of Donnelly’s personal liability.

### Remand and Further Proceedings

The district court’s decision is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each party shall bear its own costs.

### Additional Considerations

Since we have identified triable issues of fact, we do not address MDY’s additional contentions: (1) that Blizzard has unclean hands due to changes in the Terms of Use (ToU) to ban bots after the litigation began; and (2) that MDY is not liable for tortious interference because it only "honestly persuaded" people to buy Glider.

### Personal Liability Reconsideration

If MDY is found liable at trial for tortious interference with contract, the district court may then consider Donnelly’s personal liability for that tortious interference. Furthermore, the district court may determine whether Donnelly is personally liable for MDY’s violation of DMCA § 1201(a)(2). In light of our disposition regarding Donnelly’s personal liability, we also vacate the district court’s permanent injunction against Donnelly. The district court may, however, consider the propriety of an injunction against Donnelly if he is found liable for MDY’s § 1201(a)(2) violations or for tortious interference with contract.
