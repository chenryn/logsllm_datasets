### Overhead and Tradeoffs

The overhead in this context serves as a tradeoff between false hits, false misses, and failure error rates. Increasing the threshold (τ) improves robustness in terms of false hits but worsens it in terms of false misses and failure error rates.

### Related Work

Watermarking has been extensively studied for multimedia data to protect ownership and ensure authentication [7, 17, 18]. Most existing watermarking schemes are based on secret keys, which require complete disclosure of the watermarking key during verification. These schemes can be categorized into three types: private (both the secret key and original data are required for verification), blind (only the secret key is needed for decoding the watermark bits), and semi-blind (both the secret key and the watermark bit sequence are required for detection). Additionally, watermarking schemes can be classified as robust (the watermark is resistant to attacks) or fragile (the watermark is easily altered if the watermarked data is modified). Robust watermarks are suitable for proving ownership, while fragile watermarks are used for data authentication and integrity checks.

With the increasing problem of database piracy, watermarking techniques have been extended to protect the ownership of published or distributed databases [1, 13, 28, 29, 26, 19, 20, 2]. Agrawal and Kiernan [1] first proposed a robust watermarking scheme for database relations, which modifies the least significant bits (LSBs) of numerical attributes. The locations and values of these bits are determined by a secret key, allowing for the localization of modified values during watermark detection. Ownership is claimed if a large portion of the detected values match the expected ones.

Agrawal and Kiernan [1] noted that database relations differ significantly from multimedia data, necessitating different watermarking techniques. A major difference is that a database relation consists of tuples, each representing an independent object that can be frequently added, deleted, or modified. In contrast, a multimedia object is composed of a large number of bits with fixed spatial or temporal order, making frequency domain watermarking unsuitable for relational data due to the potential spread of errors over all attribute values.

Other schemes for watermarking relational data include Sion et al.'s method [28], where an arbitrary bit is embedded into a selected subset of numeric values by changing their distribution. Gross-Amblard [13] designed a query-preserving scheme that ensures local queries can be answered with acceptable distortion. Recent work also includes watermarking categorical data [26], streaming data [29], XML data [27], and medical databases [2]. For categorical data, watermarking involves exchanging pairs of categorical values, with error constraints considered at the aggregation level (e.g., k-anonymity).

A common feature of these schemes is that a watermark is embedded and detected using a secret key. Without the key, an attacker cannot locate or remove the watermark unless too many errors are introduced. However, once the key is revealed, anyone can locate and remove the watermark, limiting the ability to prove ownership more than once. Additionally, the watermarking process introduces errors to the underlying data, which must be carefully managed to avoid severe impacts on database applications. A tradeoff between watermarking error and robustness is often necessary.

The concept of public key-based watermarking (or asymmetric watermarking) was first introduced in the multimedia context. Hachez and Quisquater [14] summarized the work in this area. Hartung and Girod [15] proposed one of the first ideas for watermarking compressed video, making part of the embedded watermark public for user verification. However, this approach is vulnerable to attacks that remove the public part of the watermark. Another idea involves embedding private key information into a host signal and detecting a correlation using a public key [33]. Other correlation-based public watermarking schemes include [9, 30, 11], but they are also susceptible to certain attacks such as sensitivity [6, 21] or confusing attacks [34].

Craver and Katzenbeisser [8] used a zero-knowledge protocol to prove the presence of a watermark without revealing its exact location. This scheme requires multiple interactions between the prover and verifier, which may not be efficient in practice. It is also unclear how to extend this scheme to relational databases. Our scheme, in comparison, requires no interaction between the verifier and the data owner, making it immune to oracle and plain-text chosen attacks. The watermark is certified to thwart ambiguity attacks (additive attacks in our terminology). Additionally, our scheme is both efficient and robust for typical database operations.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a public watermarking scheme for relational databases with the following properties:

- **Public Verifiability:** Given a database relation, the owner uses a public watermark key to generate a public watermark, which is a relation with binary attributes. Anyone can use the watermark key and the watermark to check if a suspicious copy of the data is watermarked. If so, they can prove ownership by checking a watermark certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority (DB-CA). The certificate contains the owner's ID, the watermark key, hashes of the watermark and DB relation, the certification date, validity period, and the DB-CA's signature. The certificate can be revoked and re-certified for identity changes, ownership changes, DB-CA compromise, or data updates. To our knowledge, our scheme is the only one to achieve public ownership proof in database literature.

- **Distortion-Free:** Unlike typical watermarking schemes that hide information by modifying LSBs, our scheme generates a public watermark from the most significant bits (MSBs). No MSBs are modified, ensuring the scheme is distortion-free. The public watermark is a database relation with the same primary key attribute as the original data, plus one or more binary attributes to store the MSBs. Even though the MSBs are publicly known, an attacker cannot modify them without introducing intolerable errors. Previous schemes introduce distortion by modifying LSBs for numerical data or exchanging values among categorical data, limiting their applicability to specific data types.

- **Incremental Updatability:** Each tuple in a database relation is independently processed in our scheme. Neither watermark generation nor detection depends on correlations or costly sorting among data items. This makes the scheme particularly efficient for typical database operations, which are mostly tuple-oriented. In the case of tuple insertion, deletion, or modification, the watermark can be easily updated by processing only the relevant tuples with simple computations of random sequence numbers and modulus operations. Due to the robustness of our scheme, the watermark certificate can be periodically updated after a batch of data updates.

- **Robustness:** Since ownership is proven after data publication or distribution, our scheme must be robust against various attacks aimed at invalidating watermark detection or ownership proof. Robustness is measured in terms of false hits (detecting a valid watermark from non-watermarked data), false misses (failing to detect a valid watermark from watermarked data due to attacks), and failure error rate (the minimum portion of data that must be intolerably modified to defeat watermark detection). Typical database attacks include tuple/attribute insertion, deletion, and value modification/suppression. Both theoretical analysis and experimental studies show that our scheme is robust in these measures, which can be adjusted by watermark generation and detection parameters. We have also studied the tradeoff between robustness and overhead. Our scheme is robust against data frame-up and additive attacks, which are more perilous to public watermarking schemes.

The major contribution of this paper is the proposal of a public watermarking scheme with the above properties. While our scheme may not necessarily supersede secret key-based schemes due to the overhead of using certificates and public watermarks, we believe it can be more practically applied in the real world for database ownership protection. Future work includes extending our scheme to other types of data, such as XML and streaming data.
