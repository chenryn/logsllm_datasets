### Figure 12: The Effectiveness of Combined Techniques (VA_M1 + VC_M2 + IR_M3) on Real Workloads and Inter-Router Techniques
- **Combined Techniques: VA_M1 + VC_M2 + IR_M3**
  - Reduces NBTI&PV guardband and overhead
  - Improves network latency and throughput

## Comparative Analysis
- **SIY + 50%_Inversion + RCA vs. Combined Technique**
  - Combined technique reduces NBTI&PV guardband and overhead by up to 70% and 41%, respectively.
  - Network latency is improved by 5% compared to SIY + 50%_Inversion + RCA.

## Real Workload Results
- **NBTI Recovery and Network Performance**
  - For high-traffic workloads (e.g., water-spatial), the combined technique reduces NBTI&PV guardband and overhead significantly.
  - On benchmarks with moderate to high traffic (e.g., fma3d, mgrid, nsquared, barnes, and ray trace), the combined technique shows consistent improvements in NBTI&PV guardband and overhead, as well as network latency.

## Related Work
- **PV and NBTI Mitigation Techniques**
  - Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate PV and NBTI effects in NoC designs.
  - Liang et al. [6] used variable latency units to tolerate PV and NBTI.
  - Yanamandra et al. [7] modeled the impact of NBTI on SRAM arrays.
  - Ogras and Marculescu [13] focused on using self-calibrating links to detect and compensate for delay variations.
  - Our work targets the interplay between NBTI and PV in both combinational circuits and storage cells, leveraging intra- and inter-router techniques.

## Conclusions
- **Impact of PV and NBTI on NoC Design**
  - As CMOS fabrication scales down, the impact of PV and NBTI on NoC performance and reliability becomes significant.
  - Proposed techniques (VA_M1, VC_M2, IR_M3) reduce NBTI&PV guardband and improve network throughput and latency.
  - Experimental results show a 47% reduction in guardband and a 24% improvement in network throughput with intra-router techniques, and a 50% reduction in guardband and 19% improvement in network latency with inter-router techniques.
