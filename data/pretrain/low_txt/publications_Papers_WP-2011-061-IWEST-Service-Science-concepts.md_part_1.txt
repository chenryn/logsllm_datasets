**Abstract:**
The emergence of digital services within the field of Service Science necessitates interdisciplinary research, encompassing areas such as business, law, economics, behavior, and psychology, to systematically design and deliver these services. Current research and methodologies have primarily focused on developing sophisticated theories, methodologies, and tools for large organizations, often making them too complex for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to adopt. This paper provides an overview of key research areas that need to be explored to create the foundational building blocks and platforms enabling non-IT professionals and SMEs to trade and manage digital services effectively.

**Keywords:** Service Science, Digital Services, Internet of Services (IoS)

**1. Introduction**
Services are increasingly becoming the backbone of modern economies, a trend further supported by the European Commission's proposal for a Directive on Services in the Internal Market [1]. The concept of the Internet of Services (IoS) proposes new business, theoretical, and technological models that can revolutionize the way services are provisioned and contracted, both within Europe and in emerging economies.

Significant investments have been made to bring the IoS concept into production systems. For example, the TEXO project [2] has developed comprehensive theories, systems, and tools to enable large companies to engineer, design, and publish their services on electronic marketplaces. Similarly, SAP Research, the research arm of Europe's largest software developer, has invested in developing languages and marketplaces for their services [3], resulting in the Unified Service Description Language (USDL) [4].

While these efforts have primarily benefited large organizations, the European Union recognizes the potential of the IoS for SMEs. To enable non-IT professionals and SMEs to design and trade services, several key requirements must be addressed:

1. **Graphical Description Languages:** Current service description languages, such as USDL, are suitable for describing complex services but are not user-friendly for non-IT professionals. A graphical representation language (gUSDL) is needed to simplify the process.
   
2. **Design Tools for Non-IT Professionals:** Existing tools, such as the ISE Methodology and Workbench [6-8], are too complex for non-IT users. New, intuitive design tools that implement gUSDL are required.
   
3. **One-Click Service Marketplaces:** Simple, easy-to-use prototypes of service marketplaces are needed to enable non-IT professionals to publish and consume services without technical expertise.
   
4. **Comprehensive Service Use Cases:** There is a need for a set of use cases, scenarios, storyboards, and patterns that non-IT professionals and SMEs can use to learn and quickly design their own service solutions.

Achieving these objectives will facilitate cross-border market access for services, creating new opportunities for SMEs and potentially increasing service consumption in the European Union by 37 billion Euros [1].

**2. Related Work**
Domain-specific graphical description languages have long been recognized as crucial for representing artifacts in various fields. For instance, SoaML [10] is a UML-based language for architecting systems of services, though it focuses on service architectures rather than individual business services. The ISE Workbench [7] includes a simple graphical language for describing service properties, but it lacks the comprehensiveness and ease of use required for non-IT professionals.

Osterwalder and Pigneur [12] present a canvas for creating new business models, which, while useful, is not tailored for the development of individual services. In the area of business process management, BPMN [13] offers a visual language for representing business processes, similar to what we propose for service modeling with gUSDL.

**3. Graphical Description Languages for Services**
Although interface descriptions for automated web services (RESTful or WSDL) are widely used, the same cannot be said for the business and non-functional components of services, which are often described in free-form text. Textual representations, while rich, are difficult to handle automatically.

Design methods and methodologies from software engineering, such as Structured Design, Jackson System Development, and OO design, are insufficient for service design. New approaches, notations, rules, and guidelines are needed to represent service designs. For example, how can a service’s business model be formally represented using a structure that adheres to domain-specific rules and is understandable to computer systems?

Existing service analysis and design tools, such as Blueprinting [23], capture the multidimensional aspects of service provisioning but are disconnected from formal notation systems and service consumption [24]. The USDL specification language [5] was developed to describe complex services, but its direct use is not suitable for non-technical users. Therefore, a graphical representation language (gUSDL) is needed to provide an easy and intuitive way to describe services, similar to how BPMN simplifies business process modeling.

To develop a suitable graphical language, the following design issues must be considered:
- **Design Issue 1:** There should be an unambiguous translation from gUSDL to the USDL specification.
- **Design Issue 2:** The design of gUSDL should account for the human factors of non-IT professionals.
- **Design Issue 3:** Each graphical construction in gUSDL should have a well-defined business, operational, and technical meaning.
- **Design Issue 4:** gUSDL should support modularity, allowing service structures to be split and recombined.

The graphical language needs to be validated and evaluated through various scenarios, including small-scale test-beds and more complex, long-running service models.

**4. Service Design Tools for Non-IT Professionals**
Current tools for developing services for the IoS, such as the ISE Workbench [8], are overly complex and designed for IT professionals. New, intuitive design tools that implement gUSDL and provide a user-friendly environment for non-IT professionals are essential. Products like Visual Rules [15] demonstrate how complexity in business rules can be managed for non-technical users, and similar principles can be applied to service design.

**Conclusion**
This paper highlights the need for research and development in graphical description languages, design tools, and service marketplaces to support non-IT professionals and SMEs in the IoS. By addressing these requirements, we can create a more inclusive and accessible ecosystem for digital services, driving economic growth and innovation.
