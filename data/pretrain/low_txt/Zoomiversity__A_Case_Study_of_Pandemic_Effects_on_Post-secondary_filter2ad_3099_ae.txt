### Applications for One-on-One and Multi-Participant Meetings

For one-on-one meetings, direct peer-to-peer connections are typically used to transmit media packets. In contrast, for meetings with more than two participants, a client-server architecture is employed. This architecture uses a cloud-hosted media server as the central point for collecting and distributing media packets to all participants in the Zoom session. A typical Zoom session involves four logical connections: one TCP connection for control and management (including chat interactions), and three UDP connections for audio, video, and screen sharing (if used). If the standard Zoom client cannot connect, users are directed to use the Web client, which relies solely on TCP.

### Measuring Zoom Connections and Client Application Usage

To assess Zoom connections and client application usage on our campus, we selected a representative day (Day2020) and analyzed transport protocol usage based on the number of connections and inbound and outbound data traffic volumes. The results are summarized in Table 5. TCP accounts for only 1.67% of outbound traffic and 0.93% of inbound traffic, indicating that few people use the Web client to join meetings. Instead, they primarily use the standard Zoom meeting connection via the client applications.

### Analysis of TCP and UDP Connections

For a typical Zoom meeting, a client should have three UDP connections for every TCP connection. However, the results in Table 5 show that the number of TCP connections is 15 times larger than the number of UDP connections. There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy:
1. **Network Connectivity or Performance Issues:** Users connecting to Zoom from certain subnets (e.g., WiFi) may experience network connectivity or performance issues, leading to problems with TCP.
2. **Administrative Management:** There might be many short-lived TCP connections for the administrative management of Zoom sessions.

### Evidence from Log-Log Complementary Distribution (LLCD)

Figure 11 provides evidence to support these hypotheses by illustrating the LLCD function for Zoom connection durations. On a logarithmic scale, a significant portion of TCP connections have small durations (under 30 seconds), which are not typical for meeting durations. UDP sessions tend to have longer durations, reflecting actual meetings, although a non-negligible portion of relatively short-lived UDP sessions indicates potential performance issues. Features like waiting rooms can also contribute to short-lived UDP sessions.

### Hourly TCP Traffic Analysis

Figure 12 offers another perspective on Zoom session issues on our campus network. It shows the hourly TCP traffic of Zoom connections on Day2020. Connections with typical SYN-FIN handshakes, as seen by our monitor, are deemed "Good." During peak hours, only about half of the byte traffic (note the log scale) is exchanged on Good TCP connections, suggesting that many connections suffer when too many users on the same network connect to busy Zoom servers. Administrative machine-generated TCP connections are short-lived and do not significantly contribute to overall traffic volume. While this issue provides insight into the implications of online learning on our campus network, identifying its root cause requires further investigation, which we leave as future work.

### Zoom Session Management

To better understand Zoom sessions on our campus network, we analyzed Zoom server usage and the administrative traffic generated between our campus VPN server and the Zoom servers. Figure 13 provides a profile-rank plot showing how connections and byte traffic volumes are distributed across clients and Zoom servers. Several key insights emerge:
1. **Client IP Distribution:** In 2020, four client IPs dominated the Zoom traffic, while in 2021, connections were more widely distributed among a larger set of IPs, reflecting the presence of more people on campus using BYOD wireless devices.
2. **Server Load Increase:** The load on Zoom’s servers increased, both in connection counts (2–3x) and traffic volume (1.5x).
3. **Traffic Handling:** Although about 2,000 server IPs are seen daily, most of the traffic is handled by only a couple hundred servers. Two servers stand out in the frequency-rank, reflecting their roles in Zoom session management for the campus network.
4. **Zone Controllers:** The top 20 server IPs in frequency-rank do not contribute much traffic volume, implying the role of zone controllers directing clients to selected Zoom Multimedia Routers (MMRs).

### Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on many aspects of people's lives. Our study provides a detailed look at the network-level effects on inbound and outbound Internet usage on a large campus edge network with over 30,000 users. Key findings include changes in traffic volume, timing, and directionality. With fewer users on campus, we observed dramatic changes in inbound and outbound traffic volumes, as well as a reduction in the degree of asymmetry in the traffic. Network application usage, particularly for Zoom and Teams, increased dramatically, and there are issues with Zoom TCP connections and session management during peak hours.

### Appendix

The monitor reconfiguration mentioned earlier occurred over a week. On July 6, 2020, we changed the reset interval from one hour to every three hours to test the robustness of the monitor against scanning activity. The experiment was successful, and on July 13, 2020, we changed the reset interval to every six hours. Figure 14 shows the distribution of connection durations before and after reconfiguration, indicating that the reconfiguration helped in capturing longer and more connections due to fewer restarts per day.
