### Abstract
Service providers are increasingly compelled to collaborate to enhance their core competencies and create partner networks to offer new services. To facilitate this collaboration, business ecosystems have been established, allowing service providers to offer both individual and combined e-services over the Internet. This paper introduces the Inter-enterprise Service Engineering (ISE) methodology, developed in the Texo use case of the Theseus project. ISE provides a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, and model-driven approach to e-service development in business ecosystems. A key aim of ISE is to integrate both business and technical stakeholders in the e-service development process, supporting them with appropriate models, methods, and tools.

### 1. Introduction
The service sector is a significant and rapidly growing part of the economy in industrial nations. For instance, in Germany, 72% of the workforce was employed in the service sector in 2007, and this trend has continued for over 15 years. Similar trends are observed in other industrial countries (Maglio et al., 2006). This growth drives service providers to innovate and develop new services to maintain a competitive market position and participate in future economic growth (Rai & Sambamurthy, 2006).

To achieve a competitive advantage, companies should focus on their core competencies rather than offering a broad range of services. Ideally, these core competencies enable the provision of services that customers perceive as superior to those of competitors. However, customers often demand complete and integrated solutions, not just individual services (Bieger & Rüegg-Stürm, 2002). This trend necessitates collaboration among companies, even with former competitors, to offer the required services.

In response, business ecosystems have emerged where independent companies collaborate to offer services collectively. These ecosystems consist of highly networked social and technical resources that generate economic value through cooperation (Kagermann & Österle, 2006). Services are integral to value chain networks and will play an increasingly important role in the future. To realize this potential, services need to become tradable goods, similar to products (Janiesch et al., 2008).

An appropriate infrastructure is essential for offering and providing these services via the Internet. The ability to combine services is a central feature for developing new and innovative services based on existing ones. Web-based services (e-services) accessible via the Internet can be combined and integrated (Janiesch et al., 2008).

### 2. Objective and Structure
Various methodologies support the development of services, with some focusing on business aspects (e.g., New Service Development and Service Engineering) and others on technical aspects (e.g., software development methodologies based on the OSI model or Service-Oriented Architectures). Most approaches either emphasize business or technical aspects, lacking an interdisciplinary perspective (Buhl et al., 2008). While interdisciplinary approaches are emerging in Service Science, we have not identified suitable methodologies for e-service development in business ecosystems.

This paper introduces the Inter-enterprise Service Engineering (ISE) methodology, which supports the e-service development process from creating a business model to implementation. ISE provides a basis for companies interested in participating in cooperative e-service development within business ecosystems.

The structure of this paper is as follows:
- Section 3 discusses the strengths and weaknesses of current business and technical-oriented approaches and explains the need for an interdisciplinary Service Engineering methodology.
- Section 4 introduces the ISE methodology, integrating selected methods from Service Engineering and Computer Science.
- Section 5 presents conclusions and future work.

### 3. State of the Art in Service Development
Before participating in business ecosystems, companies need to understand e-service development and the integration of business partners and their e-services. An appropriate methodology should guide the e-service development process. We have examined current approaches for their suitability for e-service development, considering the different types of stakeholders involved, such as business developers, business analysts, IT analysts, and IT developers.

#### 3.1. Business-Oriented Service Definitions
A business-oriented service definition typically includes the following features (Corsten, 1997; Rai & Sambamurthy, 2006; Chesbrough & Spohrer, 2006):
- Immateriality,
- Simultaneous production and consumption (Uno-actu-principle),
- Integration of the customer in the service delivery process.

However, these features may be less applicable to e-services, which can be produced before consumption and bought similarly to products in e-shops (Scheer et al., 2003).

#### 3.2. Technical-Oriented Service Definitions
A technical-oriented service definition focuses on the functionality of e-service interfaces, including (Papazoglou, 2003; Papazoglou et al., 2006):
- Self-descriptiveness,
- Platform independence,
- Composition and linkage,
- Application of standards,
- Loose coupling,
- Location transparency.

Technical-oriented definitions primarily address implementational aspects, often neglecting the business context.

#### 3.3. Comparison of Business and Technical Approaches
To identify the strengths and weaknesses of business- and technical-oriented approaches, we have established a set of criteria for comparison, including:
- Methodology,
- Service innovation,
- Business model,
- Business processes,
- Architecture,
- Service ecosystems,
- Model-driven architecture (MDA).

#### 3.3.1. Business-Oriented Approaches
Business-oriented approaches, such as New Service Development (NSD) and Service Engineering (SE), have different phases and foci. NSD, driven by Anglo-American researchers, emphasizes marketing, while SE, driven by German researchers, applies engineering know-how from product development. Both streams include various methodological approaches but generally lack detailed activities and IT-centric considerations for e-services (Daun & Klein, 2004; Buhl et al., 2008).

| **Criteria** | **NSD** | **SE** |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Methodology | ✓       | ✓      |
| Service Innovation | ✓ | ✓ |
| Business Model | ✓ | ✓ |
| Business Processes | ✓ | ✓ |
| Architecture | - | - |
| Service Ecosystems | - | - |
| MDA | - | - |

#### 3.3.2. Technical-Oriented Approaches
Technical-oriented approaches, such as SMART, SOAD, SOMA, and Motion, focus on the technical aspects of service development. For example, SMART (Service-Oriented Migration and Reuse Technique) from the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, excels in migrating legacy applications to SOA but lacks a business-driven approach and support for service ecosystems (Lewis et al., 2005).

| **Criteria** | **SMART** | **SOAD** | **SOMA** | **Motion** |
|-------------|-----------|----------|----------|------------|
| Methodology | ✓         | ✓        | ✓        | ✓          |
| Service Innovation | - | - | - | - |
| Business Model | - | - | - | - |
| Business Processes | - | - | - | - |
| Architecture | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Service Ecosystems | - | - | - | - |
| MDA | - | - | - | - |

### 4. Conclusion and Future Work
Current business- and technical-oriented approaches to service development have distinct strengths and weaknesses. Business-oriented approaches provide strong guidance for traditional services but lack IT-centric and e-service-specific considerations. Technical-oriented approaches excel in implementing and integrating e-services but neglect business models and processes. The ISE methodology aims to bridge this gap by integrating both business and technical perspectives, providing a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to e-service development in business ecosystems.

Future work will focus on further refining and validating the ISE methodology through practical applications and case studies.
