### Destruction of Benign Data and Privacy Violations

The destruction of data deemed benign, following an examination of logged information, will almost certainly result in privacy violations. Even if the data is anonymized, law enforcement agencies are likely to require its association with a specific originator for investigative purposes. If provisions exist to force the disclosure of encryption keys, it is probable that this association will be mandated.

### Conclusions

This paper has explored several key issues that need to be addressed to develop a general legal framework for the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), including defining what constitutes a "private communication." Depending on the nature of the communication, the originator may want to conceal the content (through cryptography), the fact that a communication occurred (through anonymization or pseudonymization), or both. 

Encryption, while intended to ensure the privacy of communication content, is no longer a guarantee against privacy breaches due to legislation that can compel the disclosure of encryption keys. Similarly, pseudonymizing techniques do not provide absolute privacy, as most schemes allow for the re-association of pseudonymized traffic with the originator. It is plausible that legislation could mandate the creation and retention of similar records by providers of anonymizing services. If law enforcement agencies deem IDS data essential for their investigations, they are likely to require the re-association of this data.

IDS log data likely falls under the definition of traffic data and is therefore subject to legislation requiring long-term retention by service providers. This poses numerous challenges for service providers and increases the risk of privacy violations.

Based on definitions found in criminal law and supporting legislation, the use of IDS by public and private sector organizations will likely constitute an intercept. To avoid being an offense, the use of IDS must be in accordance with one of the following exemptions: 
- Consent from the originator of the private communication or the intended recipient (express or implied).
- Authorization obtained.
- Interception by a person providing a telephone, telegraph, or other communication service to the public.

These provisions do not adequately address the situation facing public and private sector organizations. Single-party consent, although lawful, has been held to violate constitutional law. Two-party consent is considered the minimum standard, which is unattainable if one party has malicious intent. While obtaining authorization is generally possible, authorizations issued under criminal law are for evidence collection, not network protection. A global, open-ended authorization for network protection is unlikely to be granted or withstand legal challenge. Narrower authorizations under the Anti-Terrorism Act (Canada) or for law enforcement and security agencies to intercept private communications for network protection (i.e., conduct intrusion detection) are more likely to withstand scrutiny.

In a limited sense, a case could be made for applying the criminal law exemption for telecommunications service providers to public and private sector organizations. However, it is unclear whether these organizations would qualify as telecommunications service providers under criminal law, making reliance on this exemption uncertain. Anti-terrorism legislation further complicates the task of protecting the privacy of network communications and the personal information they contain. Not only can a broader range of information be intercepted under authorization, but a similarly broad range of information must be retained by ISPs and telephone companies. Additionally, there appears to have been a reduction in judicial discretion regarding the granting or denying of interception requests.

Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that addressing these deficiencies requires the creation of a new exemption under criminal law. This exemption would provide the necessary legal basis for intercepting private communications to protect public and private sector computer systems or networks from mischief, unauthorized use, or interference.

### Future Work

A significant amount of work remains to develop a general legal framework for conducting intrusion detection within the public and private sectors. Once the legal framework is established, additional efforts will be required to develop appropriate policies, standards, and procedures for the use of IDS, particularly concerning what can be collected, how that information is handled, stored, or disposed of, and who has access to the information and under what circumstances. The assistance of the legal community will be invaluable in this endeavor.

**Abstract:**
Designing secure systems to survive cyber-attacks is both challenging and complex. Initially, designers focused on building stronger security mechanisms to keep out attackers. However, some attacks still got through, leading to the addition of intrusion detectors. Despite these measures, some attacks still went undetected. Recently, the focus has shifted to building systems that continue operating despite attacks by leveraging dependability and fault tolerance techniques.

It is impossible to build an intrusion-tolerant system that survives for any meaningful time without addressing unknown attacks and finite failover resources. Hardening a system increases the adversary's work factor, but there are limits to this approach. Once an attack is developed and put in place, the time required to execute it is very small, and creating simple variants of the attack is often easy. For a well-resourced adversary, such as a state-sponsored cyber-terrorist group or organized crime, the system must handle many unknown attacks, possibly repeated quickly (seconds or minutes). This scenario will rapidly exhaust any redundant components and represents the worst-case design point.

Many fault-tolerant mechanisms rely on the assumption that faults are independent, low-probability events, which is not the case with attacks. Common mode failure, a well-understood problem, can be mitigated through diversity. Our system aims to provide continued application services to critical users while under attack, with a goal of less than 25% degradation of productivity. Initial experimental results are promising, though it is not yet a general open solution. Specification-based behavior sensors (allowable actions, objects, and QoS) detect attacks. The system learns unknown attacks by relying on two characteristics of network-accessible software faults: attacks must be repeatable (at least in a probabilistic sense), and if known, attacks can be stopped at component boundaries. Random rejuvenation limits the scope of undetected errors. The current system learns and blocks single-stage unknown attacks against a protected web server by searching and testing service history logs in a sandbox after a successful attack. We also have an initial class-based attack generalization technique that stops web-server buffer overflow attacks. We are working to extend both techniques.

**Introduction:**
Designing secure systems to survive cyber-attacks is both hard and complex. Initially, designers built stronger locks (e.g., strong security mechanisms) to keep out the attackers. However, protection wasn't perfect, and some attacks still got through. Then, designers added alarms (e.g., intrusion detectors) to alert us to the attackers. Unfortunately, the detectors weren't perfect, and some attacks still went undetected. More recently, the focus has shifted to building systems that continue operating despite attacks by leveraging the well-developed techniques of dependability and fault tolerance.

It is impossible to build an intrusion-tolerant system that survives for any meaningful time without solving the problems of unknown attacks and finite failover resources. Hardening a system increases the adversary's work factor, but there are limits to this approach. The time and effort required to identify a new vulnerability in your system and develop an exploit for it may be quite large, but to a determined opponent, it's just time and money.

The real problem is that, once an attack is developed and put in place, the time required to execute it is very small, and in many cases, the time and effort required to create simple variants of the attack are quite small. If the threat environment for an intrusion-tolerant system includes a well-resourced adversary (e.g., a state-sponsored cyber-terrorist group or organized crime), the system must be capable of dealing with many unknown attacks, possibly repeated quickly (seconds or minutes). This attack scenario will rapidly exhaust any redundant components in the system and represents, in our opinion, the worst-case design point.

Many fault-tolerant mechanisms work because most faults are independent, low-probability events and hence are easily masked. Common mode failure is a well-understood problem and one to be avoided, often through the use of diversity. Attacks do not allow the first assumption of independence, and the nature of the critical service makes common mode failure a significant concern.
