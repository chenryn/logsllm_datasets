After updating to Version 0.10.10 for macOS, I noticed that the JavaScript `let` keyword is now displayed in white, whereas it was previously blue and recognized as a reserved word. I attempted to add back the `jsconfig.json` file (which, to my understanding, is no longer necessary to enable ES6 support), but the colorization issue persists. I am concerned that other keywords may also be affected by this colorization problem.
