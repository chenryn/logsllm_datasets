### Company Size and Definition

We categorized companies into the following size clusters: 10–49, 50–99, 100–249, 250–499, and more than 500 employees. These classifications are based on the Commission Recommendation (2003/361/EC) [42]. This standard definition is consistent across European and German SME statistics, facilitating comparisons with similar studies. Our focus is on recommendations for technology departments in companies outside the technology sector, so we excluded micro-enterprises (fewer than 10 employees) from our analysis.

### Sensitivity and Risk Perceptions

We evaluated interviewees' perceptions of information security sensitivity and risk within their companies, distinguishing between management and regular employees. We also collected data on the perceived risk of becoming a victim of a cyberattack, differentiating between targeted and mass attacks.

#### Information Security Sensitivity

To assess information security sensitivity, we asked three questions (SQ: A.3.2):
1. Awareness of information security risks among the management board.
2. Awareness of information security risks among regular employees.

This approach allowed us to gauge the level of understanding and preparedness for potential security threats within the company.
