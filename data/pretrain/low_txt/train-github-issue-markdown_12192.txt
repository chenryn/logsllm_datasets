We have been continuously refining the Dashboard native filter feature behind a feature flag since the initial phase 1 testing announcement (#12148). All identified bugs have been addressed, and numerous new features have been added based on community feedback and requests. This week, we are conducting extensive testing, and all features will be fully available in the coming days. We would like to extend our sincere gratitude to all contributors (phase 2) üôè.
