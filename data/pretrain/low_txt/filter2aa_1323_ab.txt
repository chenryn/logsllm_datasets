### Critical User Organizations and Spectrum Coordination

Low-powered uses should be coordinated and authorized by rule, rather than through individual user licensing or unlicensed Part 15 use. This approach aligns with the First Report and Order (R&O), which prohibits unlicensed use of these channels. Additionally, the Commission should consider establishing rules for preemptive access to a portion of the TV band for public safety and other critical users to ensure adequate spectrum capabilities during emergency response situations. These issues are discussed in more detail below.

### II. TV White Space for Public Safety and Other Critical Operations

Motorola believes that this proceeding presents opportunities for developing technologies that can support and augment existing licensed public safety operations in the VHF and UHF portions of the spectrum. While unlicensed devices are not suitable replacements for mission-critical licensed systems, the TV white space spectrum could serve as a valuable supplement for public safety and other critical users, particularly for data transmissions, as cognitive technology advances. Such data operations could complement existing VHF or UHF voice systems at high-risk locations such as incident scenes, nuclear power plants, water treatment facilities, petroleum refineries, and transportation depots, all of which are potential targets for homeland security breaches.

The unique nature of broadcast television, being a one-way service with a relatively stable environment, allows for shared use that fully protects priority users of the spectrum through properly designed cognitive equipment. However, these conditions may not apply to bands widely used for mobile services. Therefore, it should not be assumed that sharing techniques used in the TV band can be easily transferred to other bands for sharing with other services. Motorola believes that sharing can be successful in the TV white space and that the Commission should consider policies to further promote the development and deployment of these technologies for public safety and other critical users within the TV white space spectrum. To this end, Motorola offers the following two recommendations:

#### A. TV Channels 14-20

Public safety and other critical users are generally cautious about using unlicensed devices for mission-critical applications in a band also available to commercial and consumer users due to the potential for unintended interference, especially during emergencies. This concern was a key factor in the FCC's allocation of spectrum in the 4.9 GHz band for public safety uses, despite the commercial availability of similar spectrum bands at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Motorola believes the Commission has a similar opportunity to meet some of the requirements of public safety and other critical users in the TV white space without adversely affecting the commercial and consumer markets.

In the First R&O, the Commission prohibited the use of unlicensed personal/portable devices on TV channels 14-20 to protect two-way communications systems operating in 13 markets across the country. The Further Notice seeks comment on whether this spectrum should be opened to unlicensed fixed use.

Motorola supports the Commission's decision to prohibit portable devices in the 470-512 MHz band to protect public safety operations. Much of the technical work in this proceeding has focused on protecting broadcast operations, with little attention given to ensuring that public safety, business, industrial, and commercial mobile operations on channels 14-20 are protected from potential interference. Given the severe consequences of interference to emergency responders, Motorola agrees with the Commission's view that unlicensed use of the 470-512 MHz band should not be allowed until the technology to ensure proper protection of incumbent public safety licensees has been fully developed, tested, and proven.

However, Motorola sees an opportunity for public safety and other critical users. It recommends that the Commission allow some limited and controlled use of the 470-512 MHz band by low-powered devices to help meet the needs of public safety and other critical uses. This would also allow these users and the industry serving them to gain experience and understanding of the application of cognitive radio equipment in this environment. Specifically, Motorola recommends that the Commission permit public safety agencies and other critical users to deploy fixed and personal/portable low-power devices within the 470-512 MHz band, consistent with the technical standards established in this proceeding, on a nationwide basis. These devices must rely on appropriate mechanisms to ensure interference protection to incumbent broadcast and land mobile services.

Use of the 470-512 MHz band by public safety and other critical users should be controlled and monitored. While Motorola does not recommend individually licensing users and agencies for these devices, users should be required to register and coordinate unlicensed use with an appropriate Commission frequency coordinating committee. Authority to operate these low-powered devices can be provided through the entityâ€™s general land mobile license, similar to the authorization "by rule" of radiolocation speed-determining devices ("radar guns"). This approach is consistent with the Commission's decision in the First R&O to prohibit unlicensed portable use on these channels.

#### B. Public Safety and Critical User Priority Access

In addition to establishing the 470-512 MHz band for public safety low-powered devices, the Commission should consider adopting priority access requirements for devices that operate in other portions of the TV spectrum to ensure that public safety and other critical users have adequate spectrum capacity. Public safety and other critical users should be provided with unconditional priority access to two VHF and two UHF channels in TV channels 7-25. During emergency situations, these users should have the ability to preempt users on other channels if necessary to meet critical communications requirements.

Most of the TV band spectrum, aside from channels 14-20, should be available with minimal constraints to encourage rapid deployment of lower-priced applications and provide adequate protection of incumbents. Cognitive techniques offer flexibility, but there are significant advantages to allowing public safety and other critical uses unconditional preemption for some channels. Providing public safety and other critical users with priority access to two VHF and two UHF channels on a routine basis when channels 14-20 are not available would help ensure reliable access to spectrum. When not needed by priority users, these four channels would be available for other commercial or consumer uses.

In emergencies, public safety and other critical users should also have priority access to additional channels below TV channel 26 to meet requirements in times of crisis. Examination of spectrum availability in a post-DTV transition environment shows that there are places where only minimal channels within 14-20 would be accessible by public safety and other critical users. Therefore, Motorola believes that priority access to two additional VHF and two additional UHF channels below Channel 26, where not used for full-power digital TV, would be critical to serving these needs, with expanded priority to channels below TV channel 26 during emergencies.

Access to additional channels in this range will integrate well with existing public safety and other critical uses of spectrum. VHF and UHF spectrum is typically used by smaller public safety agencies and other critical operations for its large coverage area and its ability to support unit-to-unit voice communications over significant distances and through many obstructions such as buildings and dense trees. Large cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago depend on UHF for enhanced in-building penetration, while states like Virginia, Alaska, and Vermont depend on VHF for coverage over wide areas of rugged terrain. Other public safety and critical users also deploy systems on VHF and UHF spectrum to the extent that any capacity is available. Unfortunately, there is often insufficient spectrum to fully meet the communications needs of these entities. TV white space spectrum would provide these users with supplemental options for data at VHF and UHF, complementing actions to deploy data systems in the 700 MHz and above bands.

Cognitive equipment designed for public safety and other critical uses should be capable of operating on any channel within TV channels 7-25. This will assist public safety and other critical users in deploying products capable of utilizing any of the channels that might be available in a given area without the need for multiple radios. To this end, Motorola recommends that devices operating in the TV white space support the ability for public safety and other critical users to preempt non-critical users, when necessary, on channels 7-25. Devices operating on TV channels 26-51 would not have this restraint, but devices that work below channel 26 should be required to support the monitoring necessary to be preempted.

In summary, Motorola believes that public safety and other critical users should have exclusive access to TV channels 14-20 for low-powered devices and priority access to two additional VHF and two additional UHF channels from channels 7-25. Given the flexibility of the technology necessary to make effective use of TV white space spectrum, this is a workable approach for both public safety and other critical users as well as commercial/consumer operations. As experience is gained and products improve, it may be desirable to redefine these proposed preemption requirements in the future. Given the flexibility of cognitive radios, redefining established preemption priorities should not require equipment modifications or trade-outs.

### III. Spectrum Access Methods

The Further Notice seeks additional comment on three methods for enabling interference-free operation in the TV white space spectrum: geolocation and database lookup, beacons or control signals, and spectrum sensing. With regard to the use of geolocation and database lookup approaches, the Further Notice seeks specific comment on the development, maintenance, and availability of a comprehensive database of all TV and other incumbent stations. The Commission asks whether third-party providers are willing and able to maintain such a database and what parameters should be included in the database. The Commission also seeks comment on the technical requirements for relying on the geolocation/database approach, including the appropriate method of geolocation (GPS, professional installation, or other method) and for determining the required separation from authorized users in the TV bands.

For the use of control signals to regulate device transmissions, the Further Notice notes that many of the same issues surrounding the development of a database for geolocation techniques also apply to the use of control signals. However, the Further Notice also seeks comment on the format and content of the control signal and how beacons can protect other authorized services, such as wireless microphones, whose location may not be included in the databases.

In previously filed comments, Motorola supported the use of beacons and geolocation database lookup techniques to avoid interference to incumbent users and offered specific recommendations for the implementation of these techniques. Motorola recommended that the Commission specify location accuracy rather than mandate the use of a particular location technology such as GPS to encourage innovation in the field of location technology. In addition, channel availability information sent by control signals to fixed and handheld units must be in a standard format and include a validity period for which the channel is available. The device must also include fail-safe methods to cease operation if the control signal or database information cannot be updated or accessed. Finally, Motorola noted that third-party providers of vacant channel information (e.g., a frequency coordinator, industry association, local broadcast group) should be held liable for the accuracy of location data.

With regard to spectrum sensing, the Commission has stated that its experience with Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) implemented in the 5 GHz U-NII rules leads it to believe that similar spectrum sensing rules can be applied to TV band devices. The Further Notice provides extensive discussion and numerous proposals for appropriate spectrum sensing rules for TV band devices, including proposed rules for the appropriate detection threshold, channel availability check time, move time, non-occupancy period, bandwidth, and antenna considerations, among other issues.

Motorola previously stated that it is premature to rely on such methods due to the difficulties involved in implementing sensing technology in this environment and continues to recommend that database and location information should be the final source for determining whether or not to transmit. While Motorola believes that cognitive radios will inherently have sensing capabilities for determining which candidate channels provide the best communications opportunities, it is not clear at this time whether those capabilities can be used for independent identification and protection of licensed incumbents.

As the Commission moves forward in its studies and evaluation of techniques to open the TV white space, it must consider the interaction between sensing techniques and how they correspond to information contained in their database. Issues include defining which information source may have precedence, what measures to take if a TV signal is sensed and is not part of the database, how frequently the database needs to be accessed if sensing is employed, and measures to take if the database could not be accessed. Particularly in the early stages of this effort, the Commission should proceed conservatively to ensure the protection of incumbent services and users.

For some licensed or other protected users, a static database is not practical. For example, some wireless microphone usage can be predictable and hence protected via the database (e.g., studios, sporting events, political conventions). Some uses, such as news gathering, are not as predictable and difficult to protect via a static database. For this problem, Motorola sees three possible solutions:

1. **Sensing the Licensed or Otherwise Protected User:** Sensing alone can be difficult, especially when considering lower power operations. Identifying a signal, such as a wireless microphone, is even more challenging. For a wireless microphone, any detection from a discrete spectral emission may be difficult to distinguish from other signals.
