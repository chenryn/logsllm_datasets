### Required Login and Accuracy Results

Login was required for the study. We observed significant accuracy differences between the similar and dissimilar conditions, as well as between the similar and middle conditions. No significant differences were noted between the middle and dissimilar conditions. The login durations also showed significant differences, with a 21-second difference in the medians between the similar and dissimilar groups.

The most damaging type of similarity we identified was inter-grid key-decoy similarity, which refers to the similarity between a decoy image and a non-collocated key image. In such cases, users often erroneously select the decoy image that appears similar to a non-collocated key image. To mitigate this, particularly conservative thresholds should be employed when considering this type of similarity.

### Password Enrollment and Stress Factors

Password enrollment is a particularly challenging period for committing new credentials to memory. However, our scenario introduced sufficient stress into the enrollment procedure to ensure confidence in the results. Success rates were limited by the fact that users were not working with their own images and only had one attempt to identify the images. Additionally, participants were not logging into a real system, so they were not authenticating to access anything of value. Finally, the image processing intervention we used operated only at the pixel level. Future research could explore more sophisticated techniques that incorporate object segmentation.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we explored the extent to which the process of assembling a usable login challenge for recognition-based graphical passwords based on photographs can be automated using image processing techniques. Our tests found that using a color histogram as an image signature and computing the distance between those histograms using the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) [30] provided a useful approach. In a short-term recall test involving over 300 people using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we found that automated choice of decoys to varying levels of visual similarity could impact the number of errors users made during login, as well as the login durations. Users viewing grids with progressively dissimilar decoys made significantly fewer errors compared to those viewing the most similar decoys. In the most significant case, our automated decoy selection method affected login success rates by 40%. This study illustrates that the performance benefits of recognition-based graphical passwords are closely related to the chosen image sets.
