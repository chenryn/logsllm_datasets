#### Antenna and Frequency Configuration
For the van, a "bigfoot" concept can be employed to elevate antennas. A disk antenna is suitable for low frequencies, while a gain antenna is ideal for the 800 MHz spectrum. The TRP-1000 is being set up as both an emergency dispatch center and a mobile repeater. Several frequencies have been identified for use in the new system. In an emergency, the unit will enable dispatching to the entire city. Currently, portable radios face challenges when transmitting back to a single antenna location.

#### Orlando Fire Department Mock Disaster Drill
On January 13, 2001, the City of Orlando Fire Department (OFD) participated in a mock disaster drill at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. The exercise involved the City of Orlando Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) Association, OFD, and the National Disaster Medical Systems (NDMS) Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT FL-6). During this exercise, the OFD utilized a TRP-1000 provided by the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Justice Programs (OJP), OSLDPS, as part of a demonstration and assessment initiative.

The TRP-1000 was used to link radio communications between the OFD and DMAT FL-6. The exercise simulated a tornado strike in an urban area, with 150 high school students dressed in camouflage acting as victims. These victims were dispersed throughout a section of Universal Studios Florida and were assessed and given basic first aid by 20 CERT teams (each consisting of 8 people). The victims were then transported via stretchers to DMAT, which triaged and simulated treatment for 75 of them. The event lasted five hours.

Initially, the TRP-1000s were configured with Bendix King VHF and UHF radios. The City of Orlando Police Department purchased five Motorola 800 MHz MCS2000s for installation into the four TRP-1000s. Through a multi-agency agreement, these 800 MHz radios were programmed with systems and talk-groups from neighboring jurisdictions, as well as conventional NPSPAC interoperability channels. The Bendix King radios were programmed with frequencies used within the State of Florida for interoperability and disasters, as well as Federal FEMA and NIC frequencies, also agreed upon through multi-agency collaboration.

The OFD transported the TRP-1000 to Universal Studios and set it up near DMAT FL-6. The setup was powered by AC from two property outlets. Antennas were positioned several wavelengths apart, using ice machines and the vehicle as a ground plane. The setup time was approximately 15 minutes.

After initial setup, tests were conducted with the 800 MHz, VHF, and UHF radios using an OFD portable radio. Initial attempts to generate a net between the radios were unsuccessful due to the speaker button on the VHF and UHF radios being set to PA function instead of speaker. After reprogramming, the TRP-1000 successfully generated nets between the 800 MHz, VHF, and UHF radios. Audio settings were adjusted to optimize performance and remained stable throughout the exercise.

During the exercise, one of DMAT FL-6's 25 KHz UHF simplex channels was linked to an OFD 800 MHz talk-group. The TRP-1000 performed flawlessly after the software correction, with brief instances of cross-talk and intermodulation due to the RF-rich environment and the use of carrier squelch by DMAT FL-6 radios. At the end of the five-hour exercise, the TRP-1000 was dismantled and stored in 15 minutes. Assistant Chief Robert Sorenson noted, "The TRP-1000 has tremendous potential for the City of Orlando and surrounding jurisdictions. It enables the networking of communications across different mediums, making operational interoperability a reality."

#### Arapahoe County, Colorado Project
Arapahoe County, Colorado, with a population of over 500,000, adjoins the City of Denver to the south and covers 850 square miles. Littleton is the county seat. The western part of the county is mostly urban, while the eastern portion is relatively rural.

Arapahoe County has two TRP-1000 units. One is mounted in a converted prisoner transport van, and the county is purchasing a second van with four-wheel drive and air conditioning. The unit is staffed by telecommunications technicians and is available for deployment anywhere in Colorado. Two additional technicians from neighboring counties can be called upon if needed.

The unit is equipped with 60 older VHF portable radios pre-configured for the interconnect system, ensuring that each team at an emergency site has a radio that can communicate with the command post. The TRP-1000 can be easily removed from the van for redeployment to a higher elevation, such as the top of a building.

Two additional TRP-1000 units are set up in separate vans, each with 12 antennas and two generators in a trailer. Arapahoe County contacted the FCC and state telecommunications offices to compile a list of frequencies used by emergency response agencies. This information, along with contact details for all responder agencies in Colorado, is carried on the unit as a reference.

The communications technicians have equipped the van with schematic diagrams and common cable connectors to interconnect other radios to the system at the scene. Power is supplied by two generators (one as a backup) or by extension cord hookup to any suitable outlet. The power supply is filtered through two uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units to prevent voltage spikes and ensure continuous operation.

During the TOPOFF 2000 Exercise on a hot day, the radios connected to the TRP-1000 started to drift off-frequency. Technicians now plan accordingly for heat, bringing fans or cracking windows as necessary. Extreme cold temperatures can also cause frequency drift, so the unit is staffed with radio technicians who can monitor and correct most issues. Future vehicles will be equipped with air-conditioning and heat to minimize this problem.

Plans include the addition of an Aluma 75-foot winch-up tower, which will be towed on a trailer. Arapahoe County has informed other jurisdictions of their willingness to respond within the state for major incidents and has demonstrated the system on several occasions, providing informational packets for interested jurisdictions.
