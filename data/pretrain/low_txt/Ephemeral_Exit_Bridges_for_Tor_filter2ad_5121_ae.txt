### VIII. LIMITATIONS

Exit bridges are designed to circumvent server-side discrimination against Tor traffic by making it more difficult to determine that a given traffic flow has traversed the Tor network. While the Menlo Report [14] focuses on the ethics of computer security research, the principles outlined in the report can also be applied to the ethical deployment of exit bridges.

However, services can still prevent the use of exit bridges by blocking all traffic originating from cloud service providers. This approach, as discussed earlier, could also inadvertently block (i) users who proxy or originate their traffic from cloud service providers and (ii) automated systems (e.g., web crawlers) that operate from these cloud service providers.

Instead of identifying exit bridge traffic by IP address, a website could attempt to detect the use of the Tor Browser via browser fingerprinting [18]. The Tor Browser is not intended to be a covert application. By design, it attempts to reduce the entropy of an individual user’s browser fingerprint [32, 39] by making all Tor Browsers look identical, but not identical to other browsers. A determined website administrator can likely identify the Tor Browser with high accuracy. However, this requires the administrator to (i) include JavaScript that performs measurements of the browser and (ii) add website logic to assess these measurements and produce a browser fingerprint. This process would make webpages larger and slower to load, and we are skeptical that website operators would be willing to accept such trade-offs.

Moreover, it is unclear whether website operators would even want to disallow Tor Browser users if their goal is to eliminate attacks arriving from the Tor network. Attackers who use Tor for vulnerability scanning or to send malicious content likely do not use the Tor Browser and instead attach their scripts and tools directly to the Tor client (e.g., via torsocks). We posit that Tor users who use the Tor Browser are much more likely to be non-malicious.

### IX. CONCLUSION

This paper highlights the growing threat of server-side blocking of Tor traffic and introduces the exit bridge architecture as a countermeasure to such censorship efforts. Ephemeral exit bridges are difficult to block because they are short-lived and their network locations are largely indistinguishable from other cloud-based services, including those used by website users who do not use Tor. Our experiments show that exit bridges effectively circumvent server-side efforts to block Tor, with only a modest 14.5% increase in latency relative to normal Tor usage. Additionally, based on current cloud service provider pricing models, exit bridges are inexpensive, costing under $0.01 per bridge per hour. Our implementation is available as free open-source software and can be downloaded at https://security.cs.georgetown.edu/tor-exit-bridges.
