**ATT&CK ID:** T1027.009  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Embedded Payloads

Adversaries may embed malicious payloads within seemingly benign files to evade detection by security defenses. Commonly abused file types include scripts and executables, which can be used to carry and obfuscate malicious content. In some instances, embedding payloads in this manner can also subvert trust controls, as it may not affect execution controls such as digital signatures and notarization tickets. This technique allows adversaries to maintain the appearance of legitimacy while executing their malicious activities.
