Major internet carriers, despite Google's global server deployment to serve nearby clients, still experience metro-level path inflation. However, our observations indicate that the fraction of paths experiencing this inflation significantly decreases over a 12-month period. This improvement can be directly linked to the topological expansion of these carriers.

In the remainder of this paper, we will investigate the causes of path inflation and explore the measures that carriers have implemented to reduce or eliminate it. We begin by characterizing the different types of metro-level inflation observed in our dataset. We divide the end-to-end path into three logical segments: client to carrier ingress point (Carrier Access), carrier ingress point to service provider ingress point (Interdomain), and service provider ingress point to destination server (Provider Backbone). We then define the following traffic patterns for inflated routes:

- **Carrier Access Inflation**: Traffic from a client in metro area L (Local) enters the Internet in metro area R (Remote) and is directed to a Google server in R.
- **Interdomain Inflation**: Traffic from a client in area L enters the carrier’s backbone in L, then enters Google’s network in area R and is directed to a Google server there.
- **Carrier Access-Interdomain Inflation**: Traffic from a client in metro area L enters the carrier’s backbone in metro area R, then enters Google’s network back in area L and is directed to a Google server there.
- **Provider Backbone Inflation**: Traffic from a client in area L enters the carrier’s backbone and Google’s network in area L but is directed to a Google server in a different area R. In all cases, Google servers are known to exist in both metro areas L and R.

**Possible Causes of Path Inflation**:
- **Lack of Sufficient Ingress Points**: If a carrier lacks sufficient ingress points from its cellular network to the Internet, it can cause Carrier Access Inflation. For example, if a carrier has no Internet ingress points in metro area L, it must send the traffic from L to another area R.
- **Lack of Peering**: If a carrier’s access network ingresses into the Internet in metro-area L, a lack of peering between the mobile carrier and Google in metro-area L causes traffic to leave the metro area, resulting in Interdomain Inflation.
- **Combined Lack of Ingress and Peering**: If a carrier has too few ingresses and lacks peering near its ingresses, we may observe Carrier Access-Interdomain Inflation.
- **Inefficient Client Clustering**: Even though Google has servers in most major metropolitan areas, it can still experience Provider Backbone Inflation if either Google or the mobile carrier groups together clients in diverse regions when making routing decisions.

**Identifying Root Causes**:
We perform root cause analysis by running one or more of the following checks, depending on the inflated part(s) of the path:

- **Examining Carrier Access Inflation**: For inflated carrier access paths, we determine whether the problem is the lack of an available nearby ingress point by examining the first public IP addresses for other traceroutes issued by clients of the same carrier in the same area.
- **Examining Interdomain Inflation**: For paths inflated between the carrier ingress point and the ingress to Google’s network, we determine whether it is due to a lack of peering near the carrier’s ingress point by checking whether any traceroutes from the same carrier enter Google’s network in that metro area.
- **Examining Provider Backbone Inflation**: For paths inflated inside Google’s network, we check for inefficient mappings of clients to servers by looking for groups of clients from different metro areas all getting directed to servers at either one or the other area for some period, possibly flapping between the two areas over time.

A small number of traceroutes (< 2%) experienced inflated paths but did not fit any of the above root causes. These could be explained by load balancing, persistent incorrect mapping of a client to a resolver/server, or a response to network outages.

**Results**:
We present examples of the three dominant root causes for metro-level inflation and show aggregate results from our inflation analysis, its potential impact on latency, and the evolution of causes of path inflation over time.

**Case Studies**:
- **Lack of Ingress Point**: All traceroutes to Google from AT&T clients in the NYC area enter the public Internet via an ingress point in Chicago, leading to an expected minimum additional round-trip latency of 16ms (7% overhead).
- **Lack of Peering**: AT&T peers with Google near San Francisco but not near Los Angeles or Seattle, leading to a delay inflation of at least 16ms (21%) for Seattle users.
- **Coarse Client-Server Mapping Granularity**: Verizon clients in Seattle and San Francisco were jointly directed to the same Google servers, resulting in suboptimal performance for distant clients, with an overhead of 72% and 35% for SF and Seattle users, respectively.

**Inflation Breakdown by Root Cause**:
We provide aggregated statistics of observed anomalies causing performance degradation, focusing on Q4 2011 and carriers AT&T and Verizon Wireless, in three large metropolitan areas (SF, New York, and Seattle). Google servers exist in all three areas. For all measurements issued from these areas, we quantify the fraction of traceroutes presenting deviations, the cause of the deviation, extra distance traveled, extra round trip time, and extra page load time when accessing the Google homepage.
