### Tool Overview: Mail PassView

**Tool Name:** Mail PassView  
**Category:** Password and Hash Dump - Acquirable  
**Overview:** Extracts account information saved in the mail client settings on the machine.

#### Information
- **Event ID/Item Name:** 
  - **Example of Field Name:** E-mails are transmitted using information obtained with this tool.
  - **Field Value:** If the same user name and password obtained with this tool are used for other services, they might have been misused.

#### Presumed Tool Use
- **During an Attack:**
  - **Authority:** Standard user
  - **Targeted OS:** Windows
  - **Operating Domain:** Not required
  - **Condition:** Communication
  - **Protocol/Service:** N/A

#### Execution and Logging
- **Standard Settings:**
  - **Execution history (Prefetch):** Acquired from Prefetch files.
  - **Additional Settings:**
    - **Execution history (Sysmon / audit policy):** Additional logs can be acquired from Sysmon and audit policies.
  - **Evidence That Can Be Confirmed:**

          - **For details on RDP logs, see the separate RDP document.**

- **Remarks:**
  - When a version that supports an HTTP proxy is used, HTTPS communication is recorded in the proxy. If SSL cannot be decoded due to HTTPS, only the CONNECT method is recorded.

### Tool Overview: Fake wpad

**Tool Name:** Fake wpad  
**Category:** Malicious Communication Relay - Acquirable  
**Overview:** Acquires and changes communication content by operating as the wpad server.

#### Information
- **Event ID/Item Name:**
  - **Example of Field Name:** This tool modifies the response so that the attacker's site is embedded without the user noticing.
  - **Field Value:** N/A

#### Presumed Tool Use
- **During an Attack:**
  - **Source host:**
    - **Receives a spoofed wpad file.**
    - **Authority:** Standard user
  - **Destination host:**
    - **Becomes the proxy of the source host by sending the spoofed wpad file to the source host.**
    - **Authority:** Administrator privileges are required because changes, such as to Windows Firewall to allow files to be received, need to be made.
  - **Targeted OS:** Windows
  - **Operating Domain:** Not required
  - **Condition:** Communication
  - **Protocol/Service:** 80/tcp, 8888/tcp

#### Execution and Logging
- **Standard Settings:**
  - **Source host:**
    - **The last acquired proxy setting (registry) is recorded.** *The setting cannot be distinguished if wpad is used in regular operations.
  - **Destination host:**
    - **Execution history (Prefetch):** Acquired from Prefetch files.
- **Additional Settings:**
  - **Source host:**
    - **The fact that communications were made via 80/tcp and 8888/tcp to the host that executes the tool is recorded (audit object access).**
    - **The fact that a wpad.dat cache was created is recorded (audit object access).**
  - **Destination host:**
    - **The fact that 80/tcp and 8888/tcp were listened to is recorded (audit object access).**
    - **Handle requests to wpad.dat and the proxy log proxy.log are recorded (audit object access).**

- **Evidence That Can Be Confirmed:**
  - **Source host:**
    - Communication via 80/tcp and 8888/tcp was made with a host that is originally neither a proxy nor HTTP server.
  - **Destination host:**
    - A host that is originally neither a proxy nor HTTP server was listening to 80/tcp and 8888/tcp.
    - wpad.dat and proxy.log were created.
