### 4.4.4 Onboard Generator Systems

A recent advancement in power supply systems for mobile equipment involves the use of advanced generators that operate off the vehicle's engine. These generators can provide up to 10 kilowatts of power output. The system converts the idling engine speed into an AC electrical supply, increasing the engine idle speed only when higher power output is required.

The supplier of this patented system is Auragen, Inc., which offers units compatible with most vehicles manufactured after 1996. However, using retired fire/rescue apparatus as mounting platforms for the JPS system may preclude the use of these newer generator systems. These modern systems are an attractive option for minimizing setup time, noise, and maintenance. With a system installed in a mobile communications van, it may be possible to have the TRP-1000 operational before arriving at the scene.

### 4.5 JPS Corporate Support

JPS Communications, Inc. has been a pioneer in developing radio interoperability systems for emergency response personnel. They are committed to providing ongoing customer support and continuous improvements to existing systems as they become available.

#### 4.5.1 Cabling Issues

JPS provides schematic diagrams to any jurisdiction needing to connect additional radios to the TRP-1000 system beyond the basic configuration. Some jurisdictions with communications technicians or specialists prefer to make their own cables, while others request that JPS supply the completed cables. JPS has created a catalog of available connection cables for purchase. (See Appendix for JPS Communications, Inc. contact information)

### 5 OPERATING SYSTEM MODELS

The following examples illustrate three communities that have established multi-agency interoperable communication systems using the ACU/TRP-1000 system. These communities have undertaken initial setup and operation projects aimed at providing high-performance, multi-agency communications support for emergency response incidents.

These project models are presented to demonstrate the exceptional capabilities of the ACU/TRP-1000 system and to provide insights and ideas for those developing their own high-performance, interoperable communications systems. The examples do not represent the full range of capabilities or all possible configurations of the ACU/TRP-1000 system but showcase a dynamic and comprehensive approach to solving interoperability communication problems.

The selected projects are from three distinct types of jurisdictions: a very large metropolitan city, a large growing urban community, and a rural/large city interface jurisdiction. The intent is to present ideas and examples covering a variety of settings, backgrounds, and terrains.

ODP recognizes that, although the project models described here are comprehensive, they are not perfect and are not the only jurisdictions with advanced or high-performance interoperable communication system projects.

### 5.1 Chicago, Illinois Project

Chicago, the third-largest city in the U.S., has a population of nearly 3 million people. The Chicago metropolitan area covers 228.5 square miles, encompassing the city and its surrounding suburbs, including six counties in Illinois (Cook, Lake, McHenry, DuPage, Kane, and Will). In 2000, the Chicago Fire Department responded to over 500,000 calls for help, addressing various incidents involving emergency medical conditions and property preservation. The department has six districts, 24 battalions, and a uniformed force of almost 5,000, including paramedics.

In 2000, Chicago acquired six TRP-1000 systems. Two units remain in the command center, two are reserved for deployment on an as-needed basis with neighboring jurisdictions, one is installed in a surplus vehicle, and the final unit will be similarly deployed. One of the mobile systems will be shared with federal agencies, with the goal of supporting 67 jurisdictions in the metropolitan area.

The City of Chicago's Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) is responsible for 911/311 call answering and dispatching Police/Fire/Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel within the city limits. The OEC also transfers calls requiring suburban public safety agency responses.

The OEC staffs a Field Communications vehicle, operational 24/7, with an operator/driver and an electrical mechanic/driver. Face-to-face relief at the incident scene ensures continuous communication services. Staff selection is based on previous dispatch experience, adherence to guidelines and procedures, knowledge of fire and police dispatch operations, and geographical knowledge.

The OEC, in conjunction with participating agencies, adopted a training manual consisting of specific modules. Training for the Field Communications vehicle staff took place at the OEC, including pre-approved courses and specific training on the TRP-1000. Each member received vehicle operation, driver, and personal protective equipment training. Classroom and driver training lasted three weeks, supplemented by regular in-service training, drills, and exercises. The Field Communications staff also provides on-site informational training to participating agencies.

The Field Communications vehicle is a refurbished 1992 Ford F350 with an ambulance body, equipped with a hydraulic extendible 50-foot tower that increases the system's range. Components are housed in shock-resistant cases for protection and mobility, allowing for quick installation elsewhere.

The vehicle houses a JPS TRP-1000 interoperability system with five UHF and five VHF radios, tracking and logging connections, dates, times, and users. The OEC has also installed two 800 MHz radios, one 470-512 MHz radio, and one Motorola Low Band radio. Data communications are handled by two Motorola MW520 mobile data computers with 1000 nit screens and one Microslate portable data terminal. The vehicle is equipped with a mobile cellular phone, a fax/copy/printer, 10 portable Motorola XTS3500 450 MHz radios, 10 spare batteries, and two Cadex C7000 Battery Conditioners/Analyzers. It also has an onboard charging system and a portable 5KW gas generator for extended power, along with 100-foot and 25-foot 12/3 electrical cables.

### 5.1.1 Chicago, Illinois TRP-1000 Deployment

The Chicago Fire Department is a member of the Mutual Aid Box Alarm System (MABAS), involving over 700 fire departments in Illinois, Southern Wisconsin, Northeastern Indiana, and Southwestern Michigan, operating on over 100 different radio frequencies. The Field Communications unit responds to all 2nd alarm or greater calls, special requests for interoperability communications, aircraft disasters, and accompanies the mobile command center at O'Hare Field. The vehicle can fit in a C-130 (or larger) aircraft for transport if necessary.

Field Communications responds to major power outages, marine incidents, hostage/barricade incidents, and HazMat incidents. The unit provides communications between local public safety agencies, other responders, and utility providers. The Field Communications unit does not replace incident command but acts as a clearinghouse for communications between agencies. After deployment, the operating staff is available for debriefing and critiquing, preparing a formal report for the Incident Commander.

### 5.1.2 Chicago, Illinois Operation Plan

The OEC has verbal commitments from the Chicago Fire Department, Chicago Police Department, various city service agencies, the Illinois Department of Public Health, and the Chicago healthcare industry. They also have commitments from MABAS, the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), the Community Fireman's Association (CFA), FBI, ATF, and the US Army National Guard Civil Support Team (CST).

The OEC Multi Agency Radio Interoperability Project (MARIP) team recently received the results of a survey of 75 surrounding cities in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, conducted by the Executive Management School. The survey asked each city to designate their main communication channels and a secondary channel for the MARIP.

The next step is to invite each discipline (Police, Fire/EMS, County, State, Federal, Military, Mass Transportation, and Public Utilities/Public Works) to a briefing. For example, the Police Departments will be asked to appear, receive a demo of the Field Com/TRP1000, and select a 13-person representative committee (12 members and 1 Chairperson) to develop an operational plan for the vehicle. The timeline for plan submission is three months. After all plans are submitted, the committee chairs will meet to design a master plan, projected to be ready for full implementation by July 1, 2002.

### 5.2 Orlando, Florida Project

Orlando, one of the fastest-growing cities in America, encompasses over 105 square miles. The greater metropolitan Orlando area includes the City of Orlando and three counties (Orange, Seminole, and Lake), with a projected population of over 1.75 million by 2005.

Orlando acquired four TRP-1000s, redeploying three units to surrounding counties for their use, with annual inspections by Orlando. Orlando installed 800 MHz radios to ensure interoperability with the other jurisdictions, requesting a radio from each jurisdiction to install in the unit they kept. Each system currently houses a TRP-1000 transportable module with five UHF and five VHF radios, tracking and logging connections, disconnects, and phone numbers called. The city has also installed two 800 MHz radios, one 470-512 MHz radio, and one Motorola Low Band radio, along with Mosaic antennas for UHF and VHF and two 800 MHz 5/8 wave antennas.

### 5.2.1 Orlando, Florida TRP-1000 Deployment

Orlando houses the TRP-1000 unit in mobile racks to facilitate dispatcher training at the new communications center. They are exploring vehicle deployment options and studying a mobile repeating option on a 50-foot tower, with four antennas mounted on an aluminum crossbar.
