### 7.3.1 Latency as a Function of Traffic Load

Latency is a function of traffic load. When a user subscribes to one ISP, the latency decreases by 10% when the subscription is increased to two ISPs, and an additional 10% reduction is observed when the user subscribes to four ISPs. Similar results are observed with different traffic traces or varying the user’s first-hop nodes.

### 7.3.2 Interactions Among Multiple Smart Routing Users

Next, we examine how traffic from different smart routing users interacts. In our experiment, we start with a single smart routing user (user 1) subscribing to two ISPs. We incrementally add new smart routing users, each subscribing to two ISPs, to the network to observe the interactions of smart routing traffic. To simulate a highly utilized network, we scale up the traffic by a factor of 3. For clarity, we plot only the performance of user 1 in Figure 19(a). The results for other users are consistent. As shown, the performance degradation of user 1 remains less than 2 ms as the number of competing smart routing users increases. These results suggest that smart routing users can coexist well.

We then repeat the experiment with each smart routing user subscribing to all four ISPs. Again, for clarity, we plot only the performance of user 1 in Figure 19(b). We observe that an increase in the number of competing smart routing users has little effect on the performance of user 1. Additionally, user 1 improves its performance by about 8% when the number of its ISPs increases from two to four. Other users see a similar level of improvement (5-10%) when subscribing to two additional ISPs. This result is consistent with our findings in the previous subsection.

### 7.3.3 Interactions Between Smart Routing Users and Single-Homed Users

Finally, we study the interactions between smart routing users and single-homed users through two experiments. In the first experiment, we start with two single-homed users and examine the effects of adding one more ISP subscription to user 1. The results are summarized in Figure 20. As shown in Figure 20(a), the performance of user 1 improves with the additional ISP, while the performance of user 2 remains almost the same after user 1 subscribes to one more ISP. This indicates that a multihomed user can improve its performance without adversely affecting a single-homed user. Note that the average latency of user 2 is lower than that of user 1 (with and without smart routing) in some intervals, although user 1 outperforms user 2 most of the time.

Next, we add one more ISP to user 2 as well. Figure 20(b) shows that the latency of user 2 decreases without affecting user 1. Additionally, we observe that smart routing users can take advantage of additional connections to smooth out traffic and reduce maximum link utilization by up to 10%.

In our second experiment, we have five users: one user that switches from single-homed to multihomed (user 1), two smart routing users, and two single-homed users. We compare the performance of all users before and after user 1 becomes multihomed. Our results show that user 1 improves its performance by 18%, whereas the latency of the other users changes within 1%.

### Summary

Our evaluation results based on realistic settings show that the effect of self-interference is very small under traffic equilibria. Additionally, smart routing improves performance by 10-20%. Moreover, smart routing users coexist well with other smart routing users and single-homed users.

### 8. Conclusions

In this paper, we design a series of novel smart routing algorithms to optimize cost and performance for multihomed users. Using both analysis and extensive simulations based on realistic traces, we show that our algorithms are very effective in minimizing cost and improving performance. We further examine the global effects of smart routing using simulations based on realistic topologies and traffic. Our results show that under traffic equilibria, smart routing can improve performance without hurting other traffic.

There are several avenues for future work. In this paper, we focus on algorithmic design and evaluation through analysis and simulation. A natural next step is to implement the algorithms and conduct experiments in the Internet. Additionally, we only study the interactions among multiple users under traffic equilibria. It is also interesting to investigate the dynamics of such interactions. Finally, the increasingly wide deployment of smart routing poses new challenges to ISPs by intensifying competition among different ISPs and making traffic less predictable. How ISPs should address these challenges is an open issue.

### Appendix

#### A. Proof of Lemma 3

**Proof.** We assume that \(a_k n\) is always an integer, as justified at the end of Section 4.2.2.1. Let \(x_k = qt(T_k, 1 - a_k)\). Then the left-hand side (LHS) of the lemma is \(\sum_k T_k, 1 - \sum_k x_k\). To prove \(LHS \geq \sum_k q_t(T_k, 1 - \sum_k a_k)\), according to the quantile definition, we need to show that \(\left| \{ i \mid \sum_k t[i, k] > LHS \} \right| \leq \sum_k a_k n\).

By the definition of \(x_k\), we have \(\left| \{ i \mid \sum_k t[i, k] > x_k \} \right| \leq a_k n\). Then we have:

\[
\left| \{ i \mid \sum_k t[i, k] > \sum_k x_k \} \right| \leq \sum_k \left| \{ i \mid t[i, k] > x_k \} \right| \leq \sum_k a_k n
\]

(by Union Bound)

#### B. Proof of Theorem 5

**Proof.** The proof is by reduction from the NP-complete set-partition problem [10]. Specifically, the set-partition problem is to determine whether the numbers in a given set \(S\) (with non-negative integer values) can be partitioned into two subsets \(A\) and \(S - A\) such that the sum of the elements in \(A\) is equal to half of the total sum of all elements in \(S\).

Given an instance of the set-partition problem (a set \(S\)), we construct an instance of the integral assignment problem as follows. First, the assignment problem has two ISPs, each with a cost function \(c(x)\) equal to 0 when \(x \leq \frac{1}{2} \sum_{y \in S} y\), and 1 when \(x > \frac{1}{2} \sum_{y \in S} y\). We assume that both ISPs use 100th-percentile charging. Second, we map each element in \(S\) to a flow in the assignment problem, with the size of each flow (at all intervals) being the value of the corresponding element. Then if we have any polynomial-time constant-approximation-ratio algorithm to the assignment problem, we can decide the original set-partition problem in polynomial-time by checking whether the cost returned by the approximation algorithm is equal to 0 or not.

#### C. Minimizing Cost of Total Volume-Based Charging

The problem of minimizing cost when ISPs use total-volume-based charging can be cast into the following linear program, where \(c_k\) denotes the cost function of ISP \(k\), \(t_k\) is the total traffic assigned to ISP \(k\) during its charging period, and \(TotalTraffic\) is the total volume of traffic during the charging period. This problem can be readily solved using LP software such as lp solve [14].

\[
\text{minimize} \quad \sum_k c_k(t_k)
\]
\[
\text{subject to} \quad \sum_k t_k = TotalTraffic
\]
