**Preface:**
On behalf of the Program Committee, it is our pleasure to present the proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection Systems (RAID 2010), which took place in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, during September 15-17, 2010. As in the past, the symposium brought together leading researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to discuss intrusion detection research and practice. There were eight technical sessions presenting full research papers on network protection, high performance, malware detection and defense (2 sessions), evaluation, forensics, anomaly detection and access protection, and Web security. Furthermore, there was a poster session presenting emerging research areas and case studies.

The RAID 2010 Program Committee received 102 full-paper submissions from all over the world. All submissions were carefully reviewed by independent reviewers based on technical quality, topic, space, and overall balance. The final decision was made at a Program Committee meeting held during May 19-20 in Oakland, California, where 24 papers were selected for presentation at the conference and publication in the proceedings. Additionally, 15 poster presentations were accepted, reporting early-stage research, demonstrations of applications, or case studies. The authors of accepted posters were also offered the opportunity to have an extended abstract of their work included in the proceedings.

The success of RAID 2010 depended on the joint effort of many people. We would like to thank all the authors of submitted papers and posters. We would also like to thank the Program Committee members and additional reviewers who volunteered their time to evaluate the numerous submissions. In addition, we would like to thank the General Chair, Frédéric Massicotte, for handling the conference arrangements; Christian Kreibich for handling the publication process; Thorsten Holz for publicizing the conference; Marc Grégoire for finding sponsors for the conference; and the Communications Research Centre Canada for maintaining the conference website. Finally, we would like to thank our sponsors for their support.
