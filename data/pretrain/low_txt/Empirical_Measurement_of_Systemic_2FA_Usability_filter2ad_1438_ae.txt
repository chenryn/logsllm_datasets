### Stricter Session Timeout Rules at UIUC

Neither organization has implemented a single sign-on (SSO) service that spans all their operations, leading to users needing to authenticate multiple times. This issue was highlighted in one of UIUC’s security tickets, where an administrator explained:

"First, we agree that there are too many authentication prompts. However, the real problem lies with how we handle SSO on campus. Currently, we have three major web authentication systems: SiteMinder, Shibboleth, and ADFS. None of these systems share session information, which has become more apparent with the introduction of 2FA." (SEC-10803)

A full SSO conversion would significantly reduce the user burden. An early adopter noted that other institutions have seen this benefit:

"Colleagues at other institutions report that their 2FA implementation was much smoother, with users being prompted only once every two weeks or less. Having to authenticate for each service daily is extremely cumbersome." (EARLY-73)

### Session Timeouts and Device Remembrance

UIUC has longer application session timeouts compared to UCB, which times out users after 15 or 30 minutes of inactivity, depending on the application's sensitivity. This results in a lower overall authentication burden for UIUC users. However, UCB allows a 30-day device remembrance window, while UIUC does not. This means that UIUC sessions last longer, but users must re-authenticate more frequently.

Tuning the parameters of these timeouts could minimize the user burden. For example, less sensitive applications could allow access with a remembered device, while more sensitive applications could require 2FA more frequently. Such session management changes have the potential to reduce user burden similarly to improvements in 2FA workflows.

### Limitations of the Study

Our study has several limitations. Our analysis and comparisons aim to supplement prior findings on the user burden of 2FA, but they do not provide a complete measurement of user inconvenience. Both partner organizations are universities, limiting our ability to study 2FA in the context of customers or users of free services. Additionally, both organizations use the same vendor, Cisco’s Duo Security, which may not be representative of other 2FA solutions. Integration with specific organizational workflows, practices, and vendor software can also affect 2FA usability.

### Future Work

Several open questions remain, including the effectiveness of 2FA in protecting organizations from abuse, the impact of 2FA on user workflows, and encouraging the adoption of better second factors. We were unable to measure the extent to which 2FA blocked attackers from using stolen credentials. At UIUC, the rate of credential theft did not change before and after 2FA implementation. The next step is to determine which compromises led to actual account control by attackers. Successful 2FA logins on compromised accounts indicate either benign logins or successful phishing, while unsuccessful 2FA logins suggest either a frustrated attacker or a user error. Doeffer et al. [12] measured this at Google using a blacklist of known attackers. Developing a method that does not rely on prior knowledge of attackers would be beneficial for other organizations.

Daily interruptions from 2FA can impact productivity. Past research indicates that 2FA distractions have non-monetary costs on employee well-being. Zijlstra et al. [35] found that people compensate for time lost to distraction, but this compensation incurs emotional and well-being costs. This supports Colnago et al.’s finding that initial negative perceptions of 2FA fade over time [7]. However, ongoing interruptions continue to impose an emotional and well-being cost, explaining the reported annoyance by users.

Future work could also focus on encouraging users to move away from less desirable second factors. Despite the findings of various studies, each institution has a different distribution of second factor choices, suggesting that environmental factors or design choices by 2FA implementers can greatly influence user selection. UCB’s identity team successfully educated users to use the Duo app, resulting in higher usage compared to UIUC.

Telephony-based 2FA, while popular, is the slowest, most error-prone, and incurs recurring charges. It also generates extra telephone charges and causes the greatest support burden. Problems with telephony-based 2FA are twice as common as any other second factor choice (10.20% ± 3.49%). This burden is disproportionate to its popularity, which is far exceeded by push notifications. Telephony 2FA is also vulnerable to direct attacks on phone networks and social engineering attacks on service providers [20, 22, 23, 32].

Incorporating user-owned and controlled devices into the authentication system requires additional support. While the system is plug-and-play for many users, some need extra technical support when transitioning to new smartphones or phone numbers.
