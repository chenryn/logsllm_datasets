**Instructions:**
- The following photo has been reported as containing cyberbullying content by some Internet users.
- Observe the image carefully.
- Then, in the box below, describe why you think it has been reported as containing cyberbullying content.
- If you do not think this image contains any cyberbullying content, select "Non-cyberbullying."

**Definition:**
- In this study, cyberbullying is defined as "an act of online aggression or harassment carried out through images."
- If you think that the depicted image fits this description, categorize it as "Cyberbullying," otherwise categorize it as "Non-cyberbullying."
- Imagine the scenario where the depicted image is sent to you on your mobile device. Consciously put yourself in the scenario, and categorize the image accordingly.

**Options:**
- **Cyberbullying**
- **Non-Cyberbullying**
