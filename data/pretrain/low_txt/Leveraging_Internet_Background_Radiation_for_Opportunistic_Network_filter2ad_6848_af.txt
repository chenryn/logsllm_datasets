### Table 7: Consistency of Path Change Detection Across Datasets

The number of sources for which we can detect path changes throughout our measurement periods is consistent across datasets. Large Autonomous Systems (ASes) that announce a /16 or larger prefix are more likely to be always-analyzable. However, half of the always-analyzable sources are small ASes, which announce less than a /16 block.

### Validation

We validate our method using historical traceroute data from Ark nodes [6] located in always-detectable ASes in the UCSD-13 dataset. The Ark infrastructure employs approximately 20 nodes to send traceroutes to every routed /24 block over a span of 2-3 days [6], resulting in about one traceroute per minute from each Ark node reaching the darknet. Nine Ark nodes are situated in 8 always-detectable ASes, including five educational networks, two large transit providers, and a Regional Internet Registry.

While we cannot validate all path changes from hosts sending Internet Background Radiation (IBR) due to the unknown start times of their link sharing, AS-level path changes should be observable in both Ark data and IBR. Our analysis of other IBR-transmitting IP addresses frequently corroborates path changes in traceroute data.

### Figure 11: Identifying Path Changes with IBR

Figure 11 reports the percentage of hosts in darknet data signaling a path change and the periods during which a path change was observed from IPs in both darknet and traceroute data for events in KIST (ASN 1237) and Purdue (AS 17).

**KIST (Figure 11a):**
- KIST had very few path changes in both types of data.
- All traceroute-inferred path changes for KIST, except one, align with those in UCSD-13.
- Most traceroute-inferred path changes occur around the same time as the darknet-inferred changes.
- Traceroute data indicates that the path change occurred in the core of the network.
- Further investigation suggests that traffic from darknet sources used multiple paths in the 8:00 to 8:10 time bins (hop count 16 or 17), while outside these time bins, the hop count was 16.
- For one IP address, 1-minute time bins reveal that all darknet-inferred changes align with traceroute-inferred changes.

**Purdue (Figure 11b):**
- Purdue experienced many path changes over a six-day period, with 8.9k changes in Ark data and 1.3k 5-minute bins with changes in darknet data.
- Several IP addresses show frequent path changes.
- Before August 4, 2013, traceroutes sent by the Ark monitor to UCSD-NT used the same route out of Purdue. After this date, traffic from the Ark node traversed multiple routes out of Purdue’s network.
- A likely explanation is that some Purdue sources used stable routes, while others used flapping routes. On August 4, 2013, the Ark node switched to using the flapping routes.

### Discussion

Although IBR is an erratic data source, this example demonstrates its potential to provide insights into abnormal events and macroscopic dynamics. Our success in this case study is partly due to the consistent initial TTL values, regardless of the number of sources or volume of IBR. Increased coverage and accuracy would likely result from higher volumes of IBR. This path change detection method works best in conjunction with other data sources, such as PlanetSeer and Hubble, which use passive traffic measurements to inform active measurements [31, 51]. IBR also offers unique features, such as no injected traffic requirement and intra-AS visibility.

### Summary

We have developed a framework and conducted case studies to investigate the utility of Internet Background Radiation (IBR) in inferring various properties of networks across the global Internet. Using traffic from two large darknets, we characterized IBR along dimensions relevant to macroscopic Internet measurements. We examined which networks send IBR, identified components enabling opportunistic network inferences, characterized the frequency and granularity of traffic sources, and analyzed sensitivity to the time of collection and position in the address space. Three case studies highlight the range of inferences possible with IBR, showing that it can supplement existing techniques by improving coverage and diversity of analyzable networks and reducing measurement overhead. We also taxonomized 10 other potential inferences and hope that our framework encourages further consideration of the circumstances and properties for which unsolicited traffic is an appropriate data source for Internet research. This work demonstrates the applicability of IBR to many types of Internet measurement studies and provides a template for evaluating the utility of other Internet measurement data sources.
