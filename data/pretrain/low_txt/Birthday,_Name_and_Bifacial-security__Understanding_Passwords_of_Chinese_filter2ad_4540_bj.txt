Chinese passwords exhibit distinct letter distribution, structure, and semantic patterns compared to English passwords. Therefore, when targeting Chinese passwords, it is essential for cracking algorithms to be trained on datasets from Chinese websites. These websites should also have similar password creation policies and service types as the target site.

In PCFG-based attacks, if the training set is sufficiently large (e.g., over 1 million), it is advisable to learn the L-segments of guesses directly from the training set, in addition to the D and S-segments. This approach has been shown to yield higher success rates (as detailed in Section 4.1) compared to PCFG-based attacks that use external dictionaries to instantiate the L-segments, as seen in [34, 58]. While this practice has been recommended by Ma et al. [36], they did not specify the conditions under which it should be applied. Additionally, incorporating external semantic dictionaries to instantiate the L and D-segments can further enhance the effectiveness of these attacks.

Compared to Markov-based attacks, PCFG-based attacks are simpler to implement, requiring 31% less computation and 70% less memory. They perform equally well, or even better, with a small number of guesses (e.g., 10^3, as shown in Figures 4 and 6). For larger guess numbers, order-4 Markov-based attacks are generally the most effective. To our knowledge, these observations have not been thoroughly addressed in previous major studies [15, 36]. It is worth noting that we have only presented Markov-based cracking results for guess numbers below 10^7. There is potential for order-3 Markov-based attacks to outperform order-4 and order-5 attacks at even larger guess numbers (e.g., 10^14).

### Conclusion
In this paper, we conducted a large-scale empirical analysis of 73.1 million real-world Chinese web passwords. Our analysis systematically explored several fundamental password properties, such as the distance between passwords and languages, and various semantic patterns. We uncovered the dual-natured security of Chinese passwords: they are more susceptible to online guessing than English passwords, but the remaining Chinese passwords are stronger against offline guessing. This finding reconciles conflicting claims in [7, 26, 34]. We hope this work will assist both security administrators and individual Chinese users in making more informed decisions to secure their password accounts.
