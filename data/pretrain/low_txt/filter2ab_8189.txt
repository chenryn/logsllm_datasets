### Title: Black Hat EU-22: Confidence in Chaos: Strategies for World-Class Security Operations

**Abstract:**

In today's rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape, security operations centers (SOCs) face unprecedented challenges. Imagine discovering that the smart lights in your cafeteria are connected to your corporate network and can be controlled from anywhere in the world, or learning that the sales team has been creating unmanaged AWS accounts for customer demos. To add to the complexity, your organization may have implemented full encryption to comply with data protection and privacy laws without notifying you. These scenarios highlight the need to quickly adapt and enhance your detection and response capabilities, with no room for error.

Modern SOCs must continuously adjust their defense and detection techniques to counter adversaries lurking in the shadows of your IT infrastructure. To help navigate this unpredictable operational environment, we have developed a strategic roadmap tailored to organizations of all sizes. This roadmap is based on in-depth interviews with dozens of SOC teams across various environments and draws from decades of experience in different types of SOCs.

Attendees will leave this presentation with practical, actionable steps to help their SOC excel at these challenges. They will also gain a clear understanding of how to customize SOC priorities for their specific organizational needs. At the end of the session, a link will be provided to a newly released, freely available book that delves into these strategies in greater detail. (Please note that while the digital version is free, there is a cost for the print-on-demand version, from which neither MITRE nor the authors profit.)
