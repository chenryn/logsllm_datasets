## Abstract
Wireless roaming allows a mobile device to access services from a foreign network while being registered with its home network. Recent proposals aim to keep the service provider role with the home network by creating a tunnel through the foreign network, ensuring all service requests are handled directly by the home network. This approach, known as Wireless Roaming via Tunnels (WRT), offers several security benefits but also presents new challenges in authentication and key establishment. This paper formally specifies mutual authentication and key establishment goals for WRT and proposes an efficient, provably secure protocol to secure such roaming sessions. Additionally, we describe modular protocol extensions to address DoS resistance, anonymity, and unlinkability of roaming sessions, as well as accounting claims in commercial scenarios.

## 1. Introduction
In today's highly mobile world, wireless networks and devices have become ubiquitous, both in corporate and residential settings. The increasing demand for mobility has led to the research area of wireless roaming. The primary goal of wireless roaming is to provide a mobile device, registered with its home network, with similar services when it roams to a foreign network. However, the foreign network may not be aware if the mobile device is authorized to request a roaming connection, and the mobile device may not know if the foreign network is authorized to provide this connection.

Current solutions for wireless roaming, such as those in WLANs and mobile phone networks (GSM, CDMA, UMTS, CDMA2000), assume that the requested service is provided directly by the foreign network. The home network's involvement is limited to authentication and the establishment of a security association between the mobile device and the foreign network.

A recent proposal by Sastry et al. [54] suggests a different approach. Instead of the foreign network providing the service, they propose keeping the service provider role with the home network by establishing an opaque tunnel connection. This tunnel would allow the mobile device to receive services directly from the home network, enhancing security and control.

Our main technical contribution is the design of a formal security model for authentication and key establishment in WRT, along with a suitable protocol. Section 2 introduces the WRT concept and its advantages. Section 3 reviews related work on authentication and key establishment in wireless roaming. Section 4 describes the security model, including trust assumptions and requirements. Section 5 details our proposed protocol, AWRT, and provides a security analysis. Section 6 addresses modular protocol extensions for forward secrecy, DoS resistance, anonymity, and commercial scenarios. We conclude in Section 7.

## 2. Wireless Roaming via Tunnels
### 2.1 The Concept
We consider a scenario where a mobile device, registered with a home network (e.g., a company), temporarily moves to a foreign network. The mobile user wants to access the Internet under the same conditions and policies as in their home network. To achieve this, an opaque tunnel is created from the foreign network to the home network, and all packets from the mobile device are sent through this tunnel.

The current solution by Sastry et al. [54] uses a VPN tunnel to secure the end-to-end communication between the mobile device and its home network. However, this solution has several weaknesses:
1. The foreign network grants Internet access without proper authentication, posing intrusion risks.
2. The mobile device must comply with the foreign network's infrastructure.
3. There is no proof that the mobile device is connecting to its real home network.
4. Foreign and home networks do not authenticate each other, making accounting and quality-of-service contracts insecure.

Our approach increases the foreign network's involvement in the roaming process. The foreign network verifies the authenticity of the mobile device and the home network before establishing the tunnel. We propose a three-party authentication and key establishment protocol involving the mobile device, the foreign network, and the home network. This protocol ensures mutual authentication and the exchange of session keys, reducing the risk of intrusion into the foreign network's infrastructure.

### 2.2 Advantages and Disadvantages
WRT offers several benefits:
1. **Enhanced Security:** Automatic forwarding of messages reduces the risk of unauthorized access and intrusion attempts.
2. **Network Protection:** If a mobile device misbehaves, the foreign network cannot be blamed or blacklisted.
3. **Policy Enforcement:** The home network can enforce its security policies, ensuring consistent service access.
4. **Accounting Simplification:** In commercial scenarios, both networks can independently track the duration and data transfer, simplifying the accounting process.

However, WRT may increase communication latencies due to the round-trip time between the foreign and home networks. For many applications, such as web browsing and email, these latencies are negligible. Even for real-time applications like Voice-over-IP, the additional latency may still be acceptable according to ITU-T recommendations [35].

### 2.3 Desired Security Goals
Suitable WRT protocols should protect the end-to-end communication between the mobile device and the home network, as well as their communication with the foreign network. Key goals include:
1. **Mutual Authentication:** The mobile device and home network must authenticate each other, and both networks should mutually authenticate to prevent attacks and ensure accountability.
2. **Key Establishment:** Session keys should be established for secure end-to-end communication and for the tunnel itself.
3. **Robustness:** The protocol should be robust against DoS attacks and provide verifiable information for accounting in commercial scenarios.
4. **Anonymity and Unlinkability:** The mobile device's identity should be hidden from the foreign network, and its roaming sessions should be unlinkable.

## 3. Related Work on Authentication and Key Establishment in Wireless Roaming
Many authentication and key establishment protocols have been proposed for wireless roaming in both academia and industry. These range from 2nd and 3rd generation mobile phone networks (GSM, CDMA, UMTS, CDMA2000) to WLANs (IEEE 802.11).

### 3.1 Wireless Roaming in Mobile Phone Networks
Standard protocols for mobile phone networks, such as GSM and UMTS, use pre-shared keys between the home network and the mobile device. These protocols establish session keys between the mobile device and the foreign network. Solutions have been proposed for roaming between different mobile phone networks, such as authenticated roaming between GSM and UMTS [2, 3] and between UMTS and CDMA2000 [37].

### 3.2 Wireless Roaming in IP Networks
In wireless IP networks, access control is typically based on the IEEE 802.11i security architecture, using either pre-shared keys (WPA, WPA2) or the IEEE 802.1X specification. For larger networks, IEEE 802.1X, which uses EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol), is preferred. EAP methods can be based on usernames and passwords, shared keys, or public-key certificates. EAP-TTLS is used in the Eduroam infrastructure for authenticating and granting Internet access to students and personnel visiting other institutions [28]. Web-based authentication, such as the Universal Access Method (UAM), is also widely used but is vulnerable to impersonation and dictionary attacks [43].

## 4. Security Model
### 4.1 Trust Assumptions
We assume that the home network and the mobile device trust each other, and the foreign network is a potential man-in-the-middle attacker. Both networks must mutually authenticate each other to establish the tunnel.

### 4.2 Authentication and Key Exchange Requirements
- **Mutual Authentication:** The mobile device and the home network must authenticate each other.
- **Session Key Establishment:** A session key should be established for end-to-end communication between the mobile device and the home network.
- **Tunnel Key Establishment:** An additional session key should be established for communication between the foreign network and the tunnel endpoints.

## 5. Proposed Protocol: AWRT
### 5.1 Protocol Description
AWRT is a three-party authentication and key establishment protocol. It involves the mobile device, the foreign network, and the home network. The protocol ensures mutual authentication and the exchange of relevant session keys.

### 5.2 Security Analysis
We provide a detailed security analysis of AWRT, demonstrating its compliance with the specified security goals. We also discuss efficiency considerations and practical implementation ideas.

## 6. Protocol Extensions
### 6.1 Forward Secrecy
We propose extensions to ensure forward secrecy for the established keys, preventing the compromise of past session keys.

### 6.2 DoS Resistance
We address stricter resistance against various types of DoS attacks, ensuring that the protocol remains robust even under attack.

### 6.3 Anonymity and Unlinkability
We describe mechanisms to ensure the anonymity of the mobile device and the unlinkability of its roaming sessions, similar to the use of TMSI in GSM/UMTS.

### 6.4 Commercial Scenarios
In commercial scenarios, the foreign network needs to be reimbursed for maintaining the tunnel. We propose extensions to support verifiable accounting claims.

## 7. Conclusion
This paper presents a formal security model for authentication and key establishment in Wireless Roaming via Tunnels (WRT). We propose an efficient and provably secure protocol, AWRT, and discuss modular extensions to address additional security and practical requirements. WRT offers significant security benefits and is a promising approach for future wireless roaming solutions.
