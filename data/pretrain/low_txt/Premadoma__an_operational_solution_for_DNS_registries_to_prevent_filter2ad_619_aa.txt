## Abstract
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical component of the Internet, mapping domain names to IP addresses for virtually every online service. Consequently, domain names are a primary tool for attackers to locate and relocate their malicious activities on the Internet. In this paper, we present Premadoma, a solution designed for DNS registries to predict and prevent malicious domain registrations before they become operational. Unlike blacklists, which provide protection only after damage has occurred, Premadoma can preemptively block potentially harmful domain names. Our approach leverages recent insights into the ecosystem of malicious domain registrations, with a focus on bulk registration facilitators and patterns in registrant information. We evaluate the performance and adaptability of our prediction model using an 11-month testing dataset, addressing complex and domain-specific challenges. Additionally, Premadoma has been successfully deployed in the production environment of the .eu country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registry, contributing to the takedown of 58,966 malicious registrations in 2018.
