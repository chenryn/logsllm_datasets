## What is Warez Trading?
### Warez Trading vs. Commercial Piracy
Warez trading involves the unauthorized distribution and sharing of copyrighted materials, often for non-commercial purposes, whereas commercial piracy typically involves profiting from the distribution of such materials.

### Types of Warez Traders
- **Warez Distribution Groups:** Organized groups that distribute copyrighted materials.
- **Warez Collectors:** Individuals who collect and share copyrighted materials.
- **Warez Downloaders:** Users who download and share copyrighted materials.
- **Abandonware Enthusiasts:** Individuals who focus on preserving and sharing software that is no longer supported or sold by its original creators.

## Criminal Copyright Infringement
Criminal copyright infringement occurs when someone willfully infringes a copyright:
- For commercial advantage or private financial gain, or
- By reproducing or distributing, in any 180-day period, works with a total retail value over $1,000.

**Punishment:**
- Up to 5 years in prison
- A fine of up to $250,000

## Elements of Prosecution
### (1) Valid Copyright Exists
- **Infringement:** 
  - Uploading, downloading, and distribution.
  - **Evidentiary Challenges:** Proving the act of infringement can be difficult.
  - **First Sale Doctrine:** This doctrine allows the resale of legally purchased copies but does not apply to unauthorized distribution.
  - **Fair Use:** The nature of the use, the nature of the work, the amount taken, and the effect on the market are considered.
  
### (2) Willfulness
- **Minority View:** Intent to copy.
- **Majority View:** A "voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty."
- **Good Faith Beliefs:**
  - Incorrect belief of non-infringement.
  - Incorrect belief of fair use.
- **Ignorance of the Law:** Generally not a defense.

### (3) Commercial Advantage/Financial Gain
- **Financial Gain:** Receipt, or expectation of receipt, of anything of value, including other copyrighted works.
- **Retail Value:**
  - $2,500 for felony.
  - $1,000 for misdemeanor.
  - **Price Comparison:** The price of warez versus the manufacturer's list price.

## Other Criminal Laws
### Circumvention
- **Circumventing:** Bypassing technological measures that control access to copyrighted works.
- **Trafficking in Circumvention Devices:** Selling or distributing tools used to bypass these measures.

### Hacking/Trespass
- **Unauthorized Access to Obtain Information:**
- **Unauthorized Access and Causing Damage:**

### Theft and Trade Secret Misappropriation
- **Copyright Management Information Integrity:**

## Prosecutions
### Classes of Defendants
- **Distribution Groups:** Fastlane, PWA, DOD, RWZ.
- **Individual Traders:** Levy, Thornton, Baltutat, Fitzgerald.
- **Movie Traders:** Spatafore, Gonzalez.

### Conviction Rates
- **100% conviction rate (so far):**
  - Almost all defendants plead guilty.
  - Two jury trials, both lost.
- **Jail Time:**
  - At least 19 defendants have received jail time.
  - **High:** 46 months.
  - **Average:** 25 months.

## Policy Concerns
- **Overstated Contribution to Piracy:**
  - Counting copies distorts the calculation of "lost sales."
- **Counterproductive Motivational Effects:**
  - Criminalizing warez trading may not deter it effectively.
- **Broader Criminalization:**
  - Congress has criminalized many Americans, not just warez traders.
  - **P2P File Sharing:** Is it for "financial gain" if the threshold is as low as $5.56/day of infringement?

## Predictions
- **Respect for the Law:**
  - Congress wants people to respect the law.
  - If a law doesnâ€™t work, make it harsher.
  - However, people do not respect unjust laws.
- **More Scalps:**
  - Congress wants more convictions.
  - **Busting P2P File Sharers:** A double-edged sword.
  - **Warez Traders as Targets:** Both Congress and industry hate warez traders.
  - **Public Perception:** The average person can distinguish their conduct from warez trading.

**Net Effect:**
- More warez traders will be jailed.
