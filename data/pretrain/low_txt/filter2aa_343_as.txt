# Open Directory Password Server Authentication Methods
Open Directory Password Server supports multiple authentication methods based on the SASL standard. These methods include APOP, CRAM-MD5, DHX, Digest-MD5, MS-CHAPv2, SMB-NT, SMB-LAN Manager, and WebDAV-Digest. Each method has its own security features and use cases.

### Enabling or Disabling Authentication Methods
- **Initial State**: All password authentication methods are initially enabled.
- **Management**: You can disable and enable methods using the NeST command in Terminal. For more information, refer to the command-line administration guide.
- **Considerations**:
  - Which types of password validation are needed by the services provided by your server?
  - What balance do you want between ease of access and security?
  - What types of hardware and software will the server’s clients use?
  - Is your server in a physically secure location?

### Basic Information on Authentication Methods
- **APOP Password Validation**:
  - **Usage**: POP mail service.
  - **Security**: Encodes passwords during transmission but stores them in a recoverable form.
  - **Recommendation**: Keep APOP enabled for POP email to avoid clear text transmission.

- **CRAM-MD5 Password Validation**:
  - **Usage**: IMAP mail service and some LDAP software.
  - **Security**: Encodes passwords during transmission and stores them in a scrambled form.
  - **Recommendation**: Keep CRAM-MD5 enabled for SMTP or IMAP email.

- **DHX Password Validation**:
  - **Usage**: Apple file service and other AFP file servers.
  - **Security**: Strongly encodes passwords during transmission and stores them in a scrambled form.
  - **Note**: Cannot be disabled. Required for Open Directory administration and password changes.
  - **Compatibility**: Mac OS 8.1–8.6 clients need upgraded AppleShare Client software.

- **Digest-MD5 Password Validation**:
  - **Usage**: Mac OS X login window, many email programs, and some LDAP software.
  - **Security**: Encodes passwords during transmission and stores them in a scrambled form.
  - **Note**: Cannot be disabled.

- **MS-CHAPv2 Password Validation**:
  - **Usage**: VPN service.
  - **Security**: Encodes passwords during transmission and stores them in a scrambled form.

- **SMB-NT Password Validation**:
  - **Usage**: Windows Secure Password Exchange (NT) for connecting to Mac OS X Server for Windows services.
  - **Security**: Encodes passwords during transmission and stores them in a scrambled form.
  - **Recommendation**: Keep SMB-NT enabled for easy file sharing with Windows users.

- **SMB-LAN Manager Password Validation**:
  - **Usage**: Windows Secure Password Exchange (LAN Manager) for connecting to Mac OS X SMB Server.
  - **Security**: Encodes passwords during transmission and stores them in a scrambled form.
  - **Recommendation**: Keep SMB-LAN Manager enabled for easy file sharing with Windows users.
