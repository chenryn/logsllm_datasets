### Solution for the Dual Problem

- **Dual.Setup (Σ, [T]²):** Invoke `MRQED.Setup (Σ, [T]⁴)` and output the public key `PK` and master key `SK`.

- **Dual.Encrypt (PK, [x₁, x₂] × [y₁, y₂], Msg):** To encrypt a message `Msg` under the 2-dimensional range `[x₁, x₂] × [y₁, y₂]`, call `MRQED.Encrypt (PK, (x₁, x₂, y₁, y₂), Msg)`. Note that the range `[x₁, x₂] × [y₁, y₂]` in `[T]²` is mapped to the point `(x₁, x₂, y₁, y₂)` in `[T]⁴`.

- **Dual.DeriveKey (PK, SK, (x, y)):** To generate a decryption key for the point `(x, y) ∈ [T]²`, call `MRQED.DeriveKey (PK, SK, [1, x] × [x, T] × [1, y] × [y, T])`.

- **Dual.QueryDecrypt (PK, DK, C):** To attempt to decrypt a ciphertext `C` using the decryption key `DK`, call `MRQED.QueryDecrypt (PK, DK, C)`.

In summary, the above construction maps a 2-dimensional range `[x₁, x₂] × [y₁, y₂] ⊆ [T]²` to a point `(x₁, x₂, y₁, y₂) ∈ [T]⁴`. Testing if a point `(x, y)` is within the range `[x₁, x₂] × [y₁, y₂]` is equivalent to checking whether `(x₁, x₂, y₁, y₂) ∈ [1, x] × [x, T] × [1, y] × [y, T]`. The security of the MRQED scheme ensures a similar level of security for the dual construction. Specifically, if a decryption key fails to decrypt a certain ciphertext, a probabilistic polynomial-time adversary cannot gain additional information about that ciphertext.

### 8.2 Adaptive Security

Our scheme is provably secure in the selective-ID model. A stronger notion of security is adaptive-ID security (also known as full security), where the adversary does not need to commit in advance which point in the lattice to attack. The formal definition of MRQED adaptive-ID security is provided in the online technical report [43]. Previous research has shown that IBE schemes secure in the selective-ID sense can be converted to fully secure schemes [6, 18, 46, 36], albeit with some loss in security. Specifically, Boneh and Boyen prove the following theorem:

**Theorem 8.1 ([6]):** A (t, q, ε)-selective identity secure IBE system (IND-sID-CPA) that admits N distinct identities is also a (t, q, Nε)-fully secure IBE (IND-ID-CPA).

This technique can be applied to our case to achieve full confidentiality and anonymity. In our scheme, we admit N = T^D identities, and this would be the loss factor in security.

### 9. Conclusion

We have designed an encryption scheme that allows the encryption of an arbitrary message and a set of attributes. An authority holding a master key can issue a search capability to an authorized party, enabling it to decrypt data entries whose attributes fall within specific ranges while preserving the privacy of other data entries. We have proven the security of our scheme under the D-BDH and D-Linear assumptions in certain bilinear groups. Additionally, we have studied the practical performance of our construction in network audit log applications. Beyond network audit logs, MRQED can be useful in various other applications such as financial audit logs, untrusted email servers, and medical privacy. In particular, the dual problem can be beneficial for investors who wish to trade stocks through a broker in a privacy-preserving manner.
