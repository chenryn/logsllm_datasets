## Abstract
The second ACM workshop on Moving Target Defense (MTD) was held in Denver, Colorado, USA, on October 12, 2015, co-located with the 22nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). The primary goal of MTD is to create an asymmetric disadvantage for attackers by making systems dynamic and thus more difficult to explore and predict. This workshop aims to bring together researchers from academia, government, and industry to present the latest research efforts on MTD, and to facilitate productive discussions and constructive debates on this topic. The program includes 12 peer-reviewed papers and two invited keynote talks, providing participants with a comprehensive view of emerging research.

## 1. Introduction
Current computing systems are often static, making them easy to attack and difficult to defend. Adversaries have an asymmetric advantage as they can study a system, identify vulnerabilities, and choose the optimal time and place to launch an attack. The concept of MTD is to impose the same asymmetric disadvantage on attackers by making systems dynamic and harder to explore and predict. By constantly changing the system and its attack surface, MTD increases the attacker's workload, thereby leveling the cybersecurity playing field and potentially tilting it in favor of the defender.

## 2. Scope
The theme of MTD 2015 is to address the challenges of effective defense in a dynamic environment. We invite submissions on original research in the broad area of MTD, including but not limited to the following topics:

### MTD Techniques
- System randomization
- Artificial diversity and system diversification
- Bio-inspired MTDs
- Dynamic network configuration
- Cloud-based and large-scale MTDs
- Autonomous technologies for MTD
- Dynamic compilation
- Moving targets in software coding, application APIs, and virtualization

### MTD Modeling and Analysis
- Analytical models for MTDs
- Quantitative models and effective measurement of MTDs
- Theoretical studies on modeling trade-offs of using MTD approaches
- Control and game theory aspects of deploying MTDs

### Human, Social, and Psychological Aspects of MTD
- Other related MTD areas

## 3. Workshop Objective
This workshop aims to bring together researchers from academia, government, and industry to report on the latest research efforts in MTD and to foster productive discussions and constructive debates. It also seeks to unite researchers and practitioners from diverse fields such as computer systems, networking, software, modeling, and evaluation to maximize security performance and reduce implementation costs. Security is a critical research area, and this workshop provides a forum for exchanging ideas and results in the emerging field of MTD, reflecting top research progress in attack countermeasures.

## 4. Workshop Program Format
The workshop is a one-day event featuring two keynotes:
- Michael Franz from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), will discuss software code diversity to counter attacks.
- Hamed Okhravi from MIT Lincoln Laboratory will address the evaluation of the effectiveness, benefits, and weaknesses of moving target techniques.

We have accepted eight regular research papers and four short research papers for presentation. Presentations will be grouped by topic, and ample time for discussion and networking will be provided during breaks and lunchtime. Speakers are encouraged to allocate sufficient time for questions and discussion after their presentations.

## 5. Conclusions
MTD presents numerous challenges, including intrusiveness to existing services, balancing security strength and efficiency, developing effective evaluation models, and creating a general MTD framework. Other important issues include deployment costs and usability studies. The MTD workshop provides a platform for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and progress in moving target defense. Our program of refereed papers and invited talks offers a comprehensive overview of emerging research in this exciting area.
