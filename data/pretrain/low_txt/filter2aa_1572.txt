## Threat Landscape
- Daily, numerous attacks occur, ranging from specific and targeted to automated and indiscriminate.
- Attackers can be highly skilled, well-resourced adversaries or opportunistic amateurs.
- Motivations for these attacks may include financial gain, political influence, or social status.
- Some attackers are driven by espionage or data theft, often with implicit ties to government or military entities.

## Presentation
- **Cybercrime**: Monetization through credential theft, pay-per-install (PPI), and pay-per-click (PPC) within an affiliate organizational structure.
- **Targeted Malware Attacks**: Utilize social engineering to aggressively pursue and compromise specific targets.
- **Blurring Boundaries**: Cybercrime tools and infrastructure are increasingly used for the theft of sensitive information.

## Challenges
- **Law Enforcement**: Determining the nature of the crime, applicable laws, and jurisdictional impact, as well as the need for international cooperation.
- **Industry**: Addressing dynamic binaries, the supply of new domain names, and identifying emerging threats.
- **Users**: Understanding social engineering and implementing self-protection measures.

## Part 2: Targeted Malware Attacks
- **Computer Intrusions**: Conducted by threat actors who:
  - Aggressively pursue and compromise specific targets, often using social engineering.
  - Maintain a persistent presence within the victim’s network.
  - Escalate privileges and move laterally within the network.
  - Extract sensitive information to locations under the attacker’s control.

## Low Distribution / High Impact
- [Details on low distribution and high impact]

## Targeted Malware Attacks
- Attacks against civil society organizations, business enterprises, and government/military networks.
- Typically part of a broader campaign, involving a series of failed and successful compromises.
- Often initiated via socially engineered messages, such as emails or instant messages, encouraging the target to click on a link or open a file.
- Attackers use whatever tactics are necessary based on reconnaissance and adjust their methods in response to the target's defenses.

## GhostNet
- [Details on GhostNet]

## Lessons of GhostNet
- Attackers do not need to be "advanced" or "sophisticated" to be effective.
- Maintaining persistent control is crucial for attackers.
- Attribution is difficult due to the use of off-the-shelf software (gh0stRAT) and false geolocation.
- Notification challenges include determining how and whom to notify.

## ShadowNet
- Less than 200 computers compromised, almost all in India.
- Recovered data included Secret, Confidential, and Restricted Indian Government documents.
- Involved social engineering, malware embedded in malicious documents, and a tiered command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure.

## Trends in Reconnaissance/Targeting
- Email addresses registered in the name of the target’s colleague.
- Forwarding legitimate emails (often from mailing lists) along with a malicious attachment.
- Sending multiple attachments, one clean and the other malware.
- Leveraging authority relationships, such as boss-employee, to convey importance.
- Spoofing governmental email addresses to appear authentic.
- Using the “res://” protocol to enumerate the target’s system for future attacks.

## Social Engineering
- **Spoofed Emails**: From a "real" person.
- **Content**: Real events.
- **Attachments/Links**: Exploits, drops.
- **C&C**: Port, protocol, downloads, uploads.

## Trends in Delivery Mechanisms
- Malicious attachments via socially engineered emails (PDF, DOC, XLS, PPT).
- Links to web pages hosting malware inside compressed files (.zip, .rar, sometimes password-protected) via email or instant messaging.
- Use of the default Windows configuration that hides file extensions to create executables that look like "folder" icons.
- Links to legitimate webpages, often contextually relevant to the victim, that have been compromised and embedded with malicious iframes or JavaScript.
- Use of right-to-left Unicode to disguise executables.

## Trends: Right-to-Left Unicode
- [Details on right-to-left Unicode]

## Trends: Relevant Compromised Hosts
- **Spoofed Email**: Executive Director of HRIC.
- **Contextually Relevant Content**: Sent to human rights mailing lists.
- **Link to Compromised Website**: Coalition for Citizens Rights.
- **PDF Loaded in Iframe**: Detection rate, components, and C&C details.

## Trends in Compromises/Exploits
- Exploits in Gmail (MHTML), Yahoo! Mail (XSS), and Hotmail (XSS) have been used in targeted attacks.
- Vulnerabilities, including zero-day, Adobe PDF Reader, and Adobe Flash, continue to be exploited.
- Microsoft Office file formats, such as DOC and XLS, are frequently exploited, often in conjunction with embedded Adobe Flash objects.
- Older, reliable exploits (e.g., CVE-2009-3129, CVE-2010-3333, CVE-2010-2883) are still in use.

## Trends in Command and Control
- Cloud-based C&C, SSL-encrypted webmail services, and the use of intermediaries such as blogs.
- Heavy use of Remote Access Trojans (RATs), often off-the-shelf RATs like gh0st and PoisonIvy.
- Hiding commands in base64-encoded (sometimes with custom alphabets) HTML comment tags in web pages.
- Use of domains/subdomains specific to classes of victims, often using dynamic DNS providers.
- XOR-encrypted traffic on non-standard ports.
- Use of stolen or forged SSL certificates to encrypt network traffic to the C&C server.

## Trends: C&C in the Cloud
- **Exploit**: Adobe Reader/Acrobat (CVE-2010-2883).
- **Detection Rate**: 14/43 (32.6%) VT; now 19/41 with Trend detecting as TROJ_PIDIEF.EQW.
- **Components**: Connected to drivehq.com (cloud storage) to download DLLs.
- **Exfiltration**: Uploaded encrypted data to a GMail account via SSL.

## Trends: Targeting + Stealth
- **Base64 Decode**: d:http://www.parkerwood.com/images/top.gif

## Trends: Custom B64
- [Details on custom B64]

## Trends in Persistence / Lateral Movement
- **Persistence**:
  - Windows Service and Windows Service replacement.
  - DLL search order hijacking.
- **Lateral Movement**:
  - Privilege escalation / Pass-the-Hash tools.
  - Targeting email servers and using email extraction tools (e.g., MAPI-tools targeting Exchange servers).
  - Targeting Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) (e.g., VPN & SSL certificates).
  - Obtaining directory listings.

## Trends in Data Exfiltration
- Uploading chunks of compressed archives using HTTP POST (often to the attacker’s C&C server).
- Uploading data via SSL to webmail services.
- Using the Tor anonymity network to transmit data to unknown locations.
- Employing traditional protocols such as FTP and SMTP to transmit data.

## Challenges
- Can malware used in targeted, customized attacks be detected?
- How will the move to cloud-based C&C affect monitoring methods?
- Can we distinguish highly targeted attacks from less targeted ones? Can we group the activity of specific threat actors?

## Part 3: Crime or Espionage?
- At least 15 related attacks between December 9, 2009, and December 23, 2010.
- Common method, malware, and (often) infrastructure.
- Spam email containing a link to a .zip file, which contains a Zeus binary.
- Zeus connects to a C&C, downloads an infostealer, and FTPs documents to a server (usually in Belarus).
