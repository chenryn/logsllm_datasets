### 7. Results and Analysis
Based on these results, we believe the Prefix History Predictor can adequately predict the RTT between a pair of consoles based on an NPQ estimate from a prior probe between consoles in the same pair of prefixes. However, this prediction is not as accurate as the IP History Predictor. Therefore, we suggest first applying the IP History Predictor, and only if it cannot make a prediction, then using the Prefix History Predictor.

To illustrate the number of cases where this would apply, we present Figure 13. This figure shows the CDF of the number of repeated probes in the entire trace between the same pair of IP addresses and the same pair of prefixes. Only about 5% of pairs of consoles probed each other more than once, while about 39% of prefix pairs probed each other more than once. Note that the horizontal axis is clipped at 30 for presentation purposes; the IP pair line continues to 114 probes, and the prefix pair line continues to 14,513.

### 5.3 Geography Predictor
While 39% of prefix pairs is still a significant fraction, there is still about 61% of prefix pairs left. We now consider the Geography Predictor, hypothesizing that the geographic distance between two consoles has a strong correlation with their RTT, and that current databases for mapping IP addresses to geographic coordinates are reasonably accurate. This may be true if distant IP addresses traverse longer links and more router hops to communicate. This predictor does not consider past history and thus could be applied to any pair of consoles.

**Figure 15. Distance-RTT Correlation**

It is not clear why geographic distance would be correlated with down/upstream bottleneck capacityâ€”our analysis indicates correlations of -0.075 and -0.097, respectively. Thus, we omit detailed results on capacity for conciseness and focus on RTT. We use a MaxMind location database to convert the source and destination IP addresses in a probe to geographic coordinates and apply the great circle distance algorithm [9] to calculate distance.

The distribution in Figure 14 shows a wide range of distances between probe hosts. About 14% of probes traversed over 5,000 miles, indicating room for optimization by filtering out these console pairs from the probe list. The graph also shows that we have enough samples to examine the correlation between distance and delay.

Figure 15 plots the correlation between distance and RTT for 100,000 randomly selected probes. We see a very strong correlation between geographic distance and minimum RTT. However, there is a lot of noise above that minimum, which may be due to queuing delays and sub-optimal routes. We conclude that the Geography Predictor is useful for filtering out pairs of IP addresses that are too far apart to have a low RTT.

### 5.4 Using Predictors in Matchmaking
Incorporating these three predictors into matchmaking is straightforward. For the IP History Predictor, each console will keep a history of previous probes it was involved in. It can look up this history before attempting any future probes and decide which candidate game hosts to ignore. For the Prefix History Predictor, the Xbox Live server can filter the set of candidate game hosts it provides to each console based on their prefixes and past probe history. The server already has the past NPQ estimates and can easily keep fresh BGP tables to look up prefixes. The Geography Predictor requires an IP to geographic coordinate database, either on the Xbox Live server or on each console.

### 6. Prior Work
Most prior work on network gaming has focused on games with a client-server architecture [4,5,10], where the server is well-provisioned and dedicated. The literature on P2P games is limited. In [6], the authors examine game clients deployed in three access networks: dial-up, cable, and ADSL. However, their experiments are limited to one client per access network and use only one cable and one ADSL link. The game traffic of Halo 2 is analyzed in [11] in a LAN environment for traffic modeling, not for end-to-end network characteristics between real Halo 2 players.

There has been much prior work on efficient and accurate NPQ prediction. For conciseness, we identify those done in the context of network gaming. Most of this work is for client-server games. In [12], a simple server-side method is proposed to improve server location discovery and reduce probe traffic. Our NPQ prediction methods focus on reducing overall probe time since that directly affects user wait time. We not only utilize the geographic location of consoles but also previous probe results. A flooding-style server discovery mechanism is proposed in [13] to quickly locate local servers and prevent single directory server failure. That does not scale to P2P games, as several hundred thousand consoles can be online at any time. A server selection algorithm is proposed in [14] for distant game players who want to play specifically with each other. Our work considers the general case of joining players to any acceptable game, considering NPQ data and correlators across all online consoles. The geographic distribution of game servers and players is used in [15] to redirect players to close game servers. While [16] does not consider online games, they correlate geographic location and network delay to find a host, and their experimental results complement ours.

Outside network games, there has been extensive research on characterizing NPQ over the Internet. Many studies [17,18] use PlanetLab nodes, mostly located in high-performance and stable academic networks, which do not reflect the characteristics of consumer access networks. In [19], the constancy of NPQ over time among 31 hosts is studied within a stable academic network. Our work significantly complements prior work in terms of scale and diversity of network connectivity. Studies of hosts behind consumer broadband lines are rare. It is extremely difficult to build a large testbed of such hosts on the Internet. While [20] characterizes network performance between consumer broadband hosts, they use only 25 hosts. More recently, [21] studies residential network link capacities, RTT, and loss rates through relatively large-scale measurement studies. They use 1,894 hosts behind 11 major DSL and cable providers in North America and Europe. Our study is much larger in scale, involving over 5.6 million hosts. Furthermore, they do not characterize direct network connections between pairs of broadband hosts since they measure from several vantage points located in academic networks. Techniques for estimating NPQ have been extensively studied [7,22]. Our work focuses not on the techniques themselves but on the NPQ data.

### 7. Conclusions
We studied the quality of network paths among Xbox 360 game consoles playing Halo 3, focusing on network delay and capacity measured between players prior to each Internet game match-up. We examined the general characteristics of the player population, such as geographical diversity and diurnal patterns of gameplay. Leveraging our understanding of these characteristics, we proposed three predictors for determining path quality without additional probe traffic: IP and prefix history-based and geography-based. Our evaluation showed that these predictors can significantly reduce the number of probes and hence user wait time during matchmaking. For future work, we plan to compare the initial NPQ estimate to actual in-game network performance.
