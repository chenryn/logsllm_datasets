I encountered an issue while rendering a `<script>` tag. For example, when I click on a link on Page A, it renders Page B, which includes the `demo.js` file. In `demo.js`, I have the line `console.log('Hello world')`. However, when I open Google DevTools, I do not see this message in the console. What could be causing this error?
