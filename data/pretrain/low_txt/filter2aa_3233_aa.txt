**Abstract:**
Zero trust (ZT) is an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses ZT principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows. ZT assumes no implicit trust based on physical or network location or asset ownership. Authentication and authorization (both subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established. ZT is a response to trends such as remote users, bring your own device (BYOD), and cloud-based assets. ZT focuses on protecting resources, not network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the primary component of the security posture of the resource. This document provides an abstract definition of ZTA, general deployment models, and use cases where ZT could improve an enterprise’s overall IT security posture.

This document is the result of a collaboration between multiple federal agencies, overseen by the Federal CIO Council. Specific individuals who deserve recognition include Greg Holden, Alper Kerman, and Douglas Montgomery.

**Audience:**
This document is intended for enterprise security architects to understand zero trust for civilian unclassified systems and provide a roadmap to migrate and deploy ZT security concepts. It also offers insights for agency cybersecurity managers, network administrators, and managers. It is not a single deployment plan but rather a guide to help enterprises develop a strong approach to zero trust based on their unique business and data needs.

**Introduction:**
A typical enterprise's infrastructure has grown increasingly complex, encompassing several internal networks, remote offices, mobile individuals, and cloud services. This complexity has outstripped traditional perimeter-based network security, which is insufficient once attackers breach the perimeter. This has led to the development of a new model for cybersecurity known as "zero trust" (ZT). A ZT approach primarily focuses on data and service protection but can and should be expanded to include all enterprise assets and subjects. ZT security models assume that an attacker is present in the environment and that an enterprise-owned environment is no more trustworthy than any nonenterprise-owned environment. In this paradigm, an enterprise must assume no implicit trust and continually analyze and evaluate risks to its assets and business functions, enacting protections to mitigate these risks. In ZT, these protections usually involve minimizing access to resources such as data and services.
