### Title: Black Hat EU-19 - How to Break PDF Encryption

PDF is one of the most widely used document formats globally, and it supports document encryption to ensure confidentiality. In this presentation, we will analyze PDF encryption and introduce two novel techniques for breaking the confidentiality of encrypted documents.

**First Technique: Exploiting Partially Encrypted Documents**
We exploit a feature in PDF that allows partial encryption of documents. By wrapping the encrypted part of the document within content controlled by the attacker, we can exfiltrate the plaintext when the document is opened by a legitimate user.

**Second Technique: Manipulating Encrypted Content via Specification Flaw**
We leverage a flaw in the PDF encryption specification to manipulate the encrypted content arbitrarily. The only requirement for this attack is a single block of known plaintext, which is often present by design. Our attacks enable the recovery of the entire plaintext of encrypted documents using exfiltration channels based on standard-compliant PDF properties.

**Evaluation and Disclosure**
We tested our attacks on 27 widely used PDF viewers and found all of them to be vulnerable. We responsibly disclosed these vulnerabilities to the affected vendors and provided support to help them mitigate the issues.
