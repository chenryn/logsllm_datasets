## Abstract
IP anycast is a technique used by DNS operators and CDNs to provide automatic failover and reduced latency by dividing the Internet into catchments, each served by a different anycast site. However, understanding and predicting changes in these catchments as anycast sites are added or removed has been challenging. Current tools like RIPE Atlas or commercial equivalents map from thousands of vantage points (VPs), but their global coverage can be inconsistent.

This paper introduces Verfploeter, a new method for mapping anycast catchments using active probing. Verfploeter provides approximately 3.8 million passive VPs, which is 430 times the number of physical VPs in RIPE Atlas, offering comprehensive coverage of most networks globally. By incorporating load information from prior service logs, Verfploeter can provide calibrated predictions of anycast changes. We have used Verfploeter to evaluate the new anycast deployment for B-Root and a nine-site anycast testbed, demonstrating that the broader coverage provided by Verfploeter's active probing is essential for detecting routing differences in regions with sparse RIPE Atlas coverage, such as South America and China.

## 1. Introduction
IP anycast allows Internet service operators to provide services such as DNS or HTTP content delivery from multiple, geographically distributed sites. This technique can reduce latency [28, 43] and mitigate Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks by spreading traffic across different sites, thereby providing greater aggregate capacity than any single site could [33]. IP anycast is widely used by Root DNS operators [2, 41], commercial DNS providers, and Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) like Microsoft/Bing [19], Verizon/Edgecast, and others.

Anycast operates by deploying servers at different sites, each announcing the same IPv4 or IPv6 prefix using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Networks receiving these routes select the topologically closest site based on BGP metrics and policies, defining the catchment of that anycast site. Users' queries are routed to the nearest anycast site, with no additional query-time cost for site selection.

Understanding anycast catchments is crucial for performance (throughput, latency, and load balancing), DDoS defense, and content filtering. Operators aim to minimize latency and balance load across multiple sites, especially for CDNs handling large volumes of content. Load balancing is particularly important for mitigating DDoS attacks, where matching attack traffic to capacity or isolating it to certain catchments is essential [33].

Anycast catchments also interact with country-specific content filtering policies. For example, in 2010, the I-Root DNS service's site in Beijing expanded its catchment outside China, imposing China’s censorship policies beyond its borders [30]. More recently, in early 2017, the K-Root anycast site in Iran had a catchment that extended outside the country, inconsistent with the policies of the K-Root operators [1, 29].

The challenge in managing anycast is that BGP routing can be unpredictable. While BGP defines nearness in terms of AS-hops, one AS hop across a global network (e.g., AT&T, Tata, NTT) can have very different latency compared to one AS hop across a small ISP. Additionally, BGP policy controls allow ISPs to manipulate routing for business reasons, making BGP routing less predictable.

Current approaches to manage anycast catchments include one-off active measurements [11], platforms like RIPE Atlas [12, 43], commercial services, and analysis of anycast service logs [22]. These methods provide insights, but even the largest services have relatively few VPs (hundreds to 10,000), and it is unclear how these measurements relate to actual operational traffic. Log analysis offers accurate load representation but requires the anycast service to be in operation and actively used.

The main contribution of this paper is a new approach to mapping anycast catchments (§3) that has been validated through real-world ground truth. This approach provides broad coverage and can be combined with traffic history to estimate load, providing operational value for one anycast service and a method that can be used by others. The key insight is to use active probing with the anycast service itself and historical traffic to predict future load. In §5, we show that active probing covers about 4 million /24 networks, providing 430 times more information than current public measurement platforms.

The second contribution is to use Verfploeter to examine the operational catchment for B-Root and a nine-site anycast testbed (§6). B-Root deployed anycast in May 2017, and our approach contributed to the success of this deployment. Analyzing this active network deployment allows us to compare the predictive capability of our approach to prior methods like RIPE Atlas. Evaluation of our Tangled testbed lets us test a larger anycast deployment (nine sites compared to B-Root’s two sites). Our approach provides a new way to evaluate anycast stability with much broader coverage than recent studies [48].

Although our case study focuses on DNS, Verfploeter can examine any anycast service, though load prediction requires a system that can estimate historical traffic load. A complete version of Verfploeter is available as open source at https://github.com/woutifier and https://ant.isi.edu/software/lander/. We have released all the data used in this paper (except LN-4-12, which is not ours); see citations in Table 1 and Table 2.

### 2. Related Work
Several prior approaches have been used to measure anycast catchments using various techniques.

### 3. Verfploeter: Global Probing
Our approach includes components to map anycast catchments for a large fraction of prefixes in the Internet and to estimate load from each of these prefixes.

#### 3.1 Mapping Anycast Catchments
Traditional approaches to measuring anycast catchments use many vantage points (VPs) around the Internet, with each VP querying the anycast service to determine its catchment. In prior work for DNS, the VPs are typically RIPE Atlas probes [39, 43], and the queries use DNS TXT records with the special CHAOS network type and the name "hostname.bind" [49], or the newer NSID option in DNS [4].

By using Verfploeter, we can achieve much broader and more consistent coverage, enabling more accurate and reliable anycast catchment mapping and load prediction.
