## Abstract
This paper provides a brief summary of the 7th International Workshop on Managing Insider Security Threats (MIST 2015). MIST 2015 is held in conjunction with the 22nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2015). The workshop aims to highlight the most recent challenges and advanced technologies for managing insider security threats.

## Categories and Subject Descriptors
K.6.5 [Security and Protection]: Invasive software (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojan horses), Unauthorized access (e.g., hacking, phreaking).

## General Terms
- Insider threats
- Data leakage prevention
- Cyber security and defense

## Keywords
- Insider threats
- Data leakage prevention
- Cyber security and defense

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, insider attacks by authorized users have significantly increased, posing a substantial risk of critical damage [1]. Malicious insiders can harm their organizations by stealing intellectual property, sabotaging corporate IT systems, or misusing IT systems to execute financial fraud. Despite extensive research, preventing, detecting, and responding to insider threats remain among the most challenging issues in the field of security [2, 3].

To address these challenges, the MIST workshop has been held annually since 2009. The workshop serves as a platform for discussing the latest challenges and advancements in defending against insider security threats and information leakages.

## 2. MIST Program
MIST 2015 is a one-day workshop that will take place on October 16, 2015, in conjunction with the ACM CCS 2015 at The Denver Marriot City Center, Denver, Colorado, USA. The workshop includes six oral and four poster presentations, as well as an invited talk and a panel discussion:

- **Invited Talk**: "Detecting Insider Threats: Who Is Winning the Game?" by Dr. William R. Claycomb
- **Panel Discussion**: "Cyber Threats to Industrial Control Systems" by Prof. Kangbin Yim et al.

## 3. Workshop Organizers
- **Ilsun You (General Co-Chair)**: Associate Professor at Soon Chun Hyang University, Republic of Korea. He holds M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Dankook University, Seoul, Korea, and a second Ph.D. from Kyushu University, Japan. Dr. You has published over 120 papers and 30 special issues in areas such as internet security, formal security analysis, and insider threats. He is a Fellow of the IET and a Senior member of the IEEE.
- **Elisa Bertino (General Co-Chair)**: Professor of Computer Science at Purdue University and Research Director of the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS) and Director of Cyber Center (Discovery Park). Her research interests include security, privacy, digital identity management systems, database systems, distributed systems, and multimedia systems. She has served as chair of the ACM SIGSAC and as a member of the editorial boards of several international journals. She is a Fellow of the IEEE and the ACM, and has received multiple awards for her contributions to database systems and secure distributed systems.
