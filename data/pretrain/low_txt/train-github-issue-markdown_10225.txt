This tracking issue addresses the unstable `iter_to_slice` feature in the standard library. Recently, the `into_vec` adaptor for `vec::IntoIter` was removed, and there is a consideration to potentially remove `iter_to_slice` as well. The utility of enhancing iterators with this kind of functionality is currently under evaluation, as its overall value and necessity are not entirely clear.
