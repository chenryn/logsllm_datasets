## Abstract

Wireless networks of low-power sensing devices are on the verge of becoming a ubiquitous part of the computing landscape, with applications ranging from healthcare to military operations. The challenge for the information security community is to develop common security services (confidentiality, integrity, etc.) for these sensor networks while adhering to their stringent resource constraints. This forum will present a broad range of ongoing research efforts to familiarize the general information security community with the issues and concerns related to sensor network security.

## 1. Overview

The emergence of low-power sensor networking has been driven by advancements in several fields, including nanotechnology, Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS), radio frequency communications, and microprocessors. These developments are exemplified by projects such as UC Berkeley's "Smart Dust," which recently introduced a sensor/transceiver chip called Spec. This chip is just 5 mm² in size and consumes one-thousandth the power of a conventional cell phone [1]. Such miniaturized sensor/transceiver units create a powerful tool for information gathering. These networks may include more powerful base stations or relay points that connect the sensor network to the outside world. In other cases, the sensor nodes themselves serve as dynamic relay points. Current commercial networks, such as those provided by Crossbow, Dust, Ember, and Sensicast Systems, offer custom communication stacks and support for symmetric encryption. Efficient key management, which minimizes the use of communication and computation, remains a critical challenge.

Security research for sensor networks takes several forms:

- **New, More Efficient Cryptographic Algorithms and Security Protocols:**
  - Efficient versions of public key cryptography, such as the NTRU algorithms [2], and broadcast authentication protocols, like µTESLA [3], have been developed.
  
- **Asymmetric Algorithms and Protocols:**
  - Security services have been designed to place the primary computational and communication burden on external entities or relay devices rather than on sensor nodes.
  
- **Integration of Security into Applications:**
  - The computing infrastructure of miniaturized devices is often much flatter than that of conventional devices, avoiding layers of networking protocols and application functionality for performance reasons. This approach requires security to be deployed at higher abstraction levels, as generic security services are too costly.
  
- **Limited Acceptance of Vulnerabilities:**
  - Sensor network security services have been designed to accept specific vulnerabilities when they are compatible with application goals and provide performance advantages. Examples include reduced computational rounds in symmetric encryption and key management protocols that rely on initially unauthenticated messages.

Forum participants will describe their efforts to create and deploy security services in ad hoc networking environments and their vision for the future. This includes "bootstrapping protocols" that enable devices to establish secure local links with their neighbors shortly after the network is deployed.
