### Who Am I? (iamit)
- **Iftach Ian Amit** (In Hebrew, it makes more sense…)
- **Managing Partner at Security Art**
- **Past Roles:**
  - Director of Security Research at Aladdin
  - Director of Security Research at Finjan
  - Various security consulting and integration roles in R&D and IT
- **A Helping Hand When Needed… (IAF)**

### Background – How Do You Start Anyway?
- **Skills and Sheer Luck**
- **Familiarity with triquitips.com?**
  - It's a "tips for better programming site."
  - Neither was I.
  - How about federconsumatori.it (consumer reports for Italy)?
  - Many of these sites started looking similar and pointing to the same place.

### First Encounters
- **gwtsdjeni.com**
  - A meaningful and somewhat different naming convention from the usual Torpig.
  - An extra letter gives it away (should be xxxxjeni.com, but we got xxxxdjeni.com).
  - Closer look: en.php

### Doors, Windows, and Other Entry Points
- **Initial Discovery**
  - If there’s a shell, there are at least 57 of them…

### Dances with Lawyers
- **First Dilemma: Have We Gone Too Far?**
  - Followed an injected script on a legitimate site (deobfuscated, viewed source, identified server).
  - Found a service without user/password protection or disclaimers (en.php, r57new.php).
- **Second Dilemma: Should We Go Further?**
  - Already had access to most of the server.
  - No plans to brute-force or guess credentials.

### Slip Sliding Down the Hole
- **Decision Made (Thanks to Legal Department!)**
- **Content Structure:**
  - Neosploit (in cgi-bin)
  - Automated FTP Iframe injection tool
  - PHPMyAdmin
  - Large collection of Trojans
  - AWStats logs
  - Setup instructions
  - “mail” backend for tracking infections
  - /mc366 – filled with OpenVPN certificates
  - Huge list of CPanel credentials
  - Additional utilities and exploits
  - 15 most wanted???

### Tools – FTP IFramer
- **FTP IFrame Auto-Attacker**
  - Managed separately for each system user.
  - Each user ran several campaigns.
  - Logs contained over 200k credentials used.

### Tools – Neosploit
- **Overview**
  - The "Rock Star" of crimeware toolkits.
  - Version 1: Solid exploit, simple management, single-user system, no licensing.
  - Version 2: Multiple user support (SaaS), enhanced reporting, multiple loader configurations, license locked to IP, server-validated, database moved to flat files.
  - Version 3: Enhanced licensing (IP+user/pass), installation through SOCKS proxy, enhanced reporting, enhanced database management.

### Neosploit – Digging Deeper
- **Installation**
  - Fully automated using a CGI script.
  - User & password for licensing.
  - Downloads build from 0x0c0c0c0c.com.
  - Goes through a SOCKS proxy at 12.219.55.171:7062.
  - Handles version checking, unpacking, permissions, init scripts, and logging.

### Neosploit Update Statistics (Based on Logs)
- **Update Frequency**
  - [Graph showing update statistics]

### The Rest Ain’t That Fun
- **ndaemon – Backend Daemon**
  - Implements the DB interface.
- **index.cgi – Exploitation Frontend**
  - Basic decision making based on backend data and victim information.
- **admin.cgi – Admin Interface**
  - Frontend for querying backend for statistical data and basic configuration.

### Told You So
- **License Verification**
  - Code snippet showing the process of verifying the license, connecting to the homeserver, and handling various functions like GeoIP, form parsing, and timer management.

This revised version aims to make the presentation more structured, clear, and professional.
