### No Phase Calibration: Final System is MegaMIMO 2.0
The final system, MegaMIMO 2.0, operates with a fixed, manually chosen gain setting, similar to the configuration in USRPs. We conducted the experiment 10 times, varying the client locations across each run. We compared the network throughput achieved by the system in all three settings.

### Results
Figure 8 illustrates the network throughput for each of the three scenarios. The following observations are noteworthy:
- **MegaMIMO 2.0 with AGC and Both Magnitude and Phase Calibration:** This configuration achieves the highest throughput among all systems.
- **MegaMIMO 2.0 with AGC and Only Magnitude Calibration:** In this setup, we disable phase calibration but apply magnitude calibration based on the rated AGC gain. Specifically, an AGC gain of X dB scales the signal magnitude by \(10^{X/10}\). This system, while still performing well, experiences higher variance due to the lack of phase correction and differences between actual and nominal hardware gains.
- **Manually Assigned Gain Control:** This system has the lowest performance because a single gain value cannot be optimal for all master-slave and client-AP links across various topologies, leading to low throughput and high variance.

### Real-time Performance Evaluation
In this section, we assess whether MegaMIMO 2.0 can deliver a distributed MIMO system capable of real-time operation.

#### Method
We considered dynamic indoor environments with two types of mobility:
1. **Static Nodes with Environmental Mobility:** All nodes are stationary, but there is movement due to people.
2. **Client Mobility:** Clients are moved either by mounting them on Roomba robots or by human carriers, with speeds ranging from 0.2 m/s to 1 m/s.

We deployed 4 APs and 4 clients in our testbed, comparing two schemes:
- **Distributed MIMO with Explicit Channel Feedback**
- **Distributed MIMO with Reciprocity**

Both schemes use MegaMIMO 2.0’s real-time PHY, including AGC and calibration, and differ only in their channel tracking mechanisms. We computed the throughput under four scenarios: reciprocity-based distributed MIMO with 10% uplink traffic, and explicit feedback at intervals of 30 ms, 100 ms, and 300 ms. The experiment was run for several hours, repeated for various topologies, and across the entire range of 802.11 SNRs.

#### Results
Figures 9(a) and (b) show the CDF of the throughput obtained by each client in the different scenarios. Key points include:
- **Dynamic Environment Adaptation:** MegaMIMO 2.0’s real-time PHY supports both moving devices and people, delivering a median throughput of 120 Mb/s and a maximum throughput of 194 Mb/s to four mobile clients.
- **Reciprocity-Based MIMO Superiority:** Reciprocity-based distributed MIMO outperforms explicit feedback in both dynamic environments and with mobile clients. The median throughput gain ranges from 20% to 6x for mobile devices and 10% to 6x for static devices with environmental mobility.
- **Explicit Feedback Issues:** Systems with infrequent feedback (100-300 ms) suffer from stale channel information, resulting in significantly lower throughput. High-rate feedback (30 ms) also performs worse than reciprocity due to overhead.

### Static Environment Performance
Finally, we evaluated MegaMIMO 2.0’s performance in static settings to ensure it supports the expected gains from distributed MIMO.

#### Method
We deployed 4 APs and 4 clients, comparing MegaMIMO 2.0 with reciprocity to traditional 802.11. The network had both uplink and downlink traffic, with uplink traffic accounting for about 10% of the load. We performed 15 runs, changing client locations between runs, and evaluated throughput in three SNR ranges: low (6-12 dB), medium (12-18 dB), and high (18+ dB).

#### Results
Figure 10 shows that MegaMIMO 2.0 with reciprocity achieves a 3.6× gain with 4 transmitters, consistent across the entire range of 802.11 SNRs.

### Future Work
This paper discusses the architecture and implementation of a practical, full-fledged real-time PHY and MAC layer for distributed MIMO. Future work will focus on optimizing the selection of APs and clients for joint transmission, ensuring network fairness and throughput, and determining the optimal master node for any given transmission.

### Conclusion
MegaMIMO 2.0 represents a significant step forward in bringing distributed MIMO closer to practical use. It is 802.11 compatible, addresses key practical issues, and extends the 802.11 PHY interface to support a MAC layer capable of distributed MIMO.
