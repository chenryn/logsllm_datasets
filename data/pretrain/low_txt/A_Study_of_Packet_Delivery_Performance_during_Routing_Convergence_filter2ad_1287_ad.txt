## Observations and Analysis

In general, differences in routing protocol designs can lead to significant variations in packet delivery performance. Our observations indicate the following:

1. **Alternate Path Information:**
   - When a router maintains information about alternate paths, it can quickly switch packet forwarding to an alternate path \( P \) if the best path to a destination fails.
   - Even if \( P \) is not the final path after convergence, packets forwarded to \( P \) have a good chance of reaching their destinations in a well-connected network.
   - Increased network connectivity enhances the probability of successful packet delivery.

2. **Failure Propagation:**
   - The routing protocol should propagate failure information as quickly as possible.
   - Fast failure reporting minimizes convergence time and improves the delivery ratio of en-route packets at the time of failure.

3. **Path Vector Routing and Loops:**
   - Contrary to common belief, path vector routing protocols like BGP do not always eliminate loops.
   - Simulations show that transient routing loops can occur in BGP networks, and these loops are prolonged by BGP's MRAI timer.
   - Increasing network connectivity can reduce the probability and duration of looping, even when using alternative paths without validity verification.

4. **Distance Vector Routing and Counting-to-Infinity:**
   - In well-connected networks, the issue of counting-to-infinity in distance vector routing protocols (e.g., RIP) may need re-examination.
   - RIP, for example, does not keep alternate path information, leading to packet losses when the best path fails.
   - Other loop prevention methods, such as those proposed in [6], delay routing updates and stop packet delivery during convergence, which comes at a high cost.
   - In redundant networks, a distance vector routing protocol may simply count to the next-best path, reducing the risk of counting-to-infinity.

This study represents a first step towards understanding packet delivery during routing convergence. We started with the simplest case of packet delivery between a single source and a single destination in a regular topology, measuring the dynamics after a single isolated failure. Future work will extend simulations to larger networks, multiple data sources and destinations, and multiple concurrent failures.
