## Abstract
E-mail remains a critical component of daily communication and the primary medium for modern business correspondence. Traditionally, e-mail services were independently provisioned by each Internet-connected organization. However, there has been a growing trend to outsource this function to third-party service providers. This centralization can bring both economies of scale and shared failure risks. In this paper, we empirically investigate the provisioning and configuration of e-mail services. We develop a reliable methodology to map domains to their respective mail service providers. Our analysis reveals the increasing dominance of a few major mail service providers and hosting companies over the past four years. Additionally, we explore the role of nationality and legal jurisdiction in the decision-making process for e-mail provisioning.

## 1 Introduction
Despite the rise of interactive chat and online social messaging applications, e-mail continues to play a central role in communication. Estimates suggest that nearly 300 billion e-mail messages are sent and received each day [34]. E-mail is particularly important for modern business correspondence, having largely replaced postal services for such purposes over the past two decades.

Unlike the postal service, e-mail is not centrally administered. Each Internet domain owner can make unique provisioning decisions about how and where they will accept e-mail delivery through their DNS MX records. Organizations can choose to provision separate e-mail services for each domain, share services among domains, or outsource e-mail entirely to third-party providers. These choices have significant implications for the resilience, security, legal standing, performance, and cost of e-mail services.

Recent concerns have been raised about the risks associated with the centralization of Internet services. Centralization can amplify the impact of service failures and data breaches, and it can subject data to the legal jurisdiction of the service provider's country. For example, Google-managed data is subject to the U.S. Stored Communications Act, which allows government access to data under warrant, even if the data belongs to a foreign party.

Historically, e-mail was provisioned and implemented independently by each organization, but the rise of third-party enterprise mail service providers like Google and Microsoft has challenged this. Despite the importance of this issue, there has been little empirical analysis of e-mail provisioning choices and their evolution over time.

In this paper, we perform a large-scale measurement and analysis of e-mail service provisioning and configuration. We use three large datasets: all .gov domains, a stable subset of the Alexa top 1 million domains observed between 2017 and 2021, and a random sample of one million .com domains from the same period. Our study provides insights into the current popularity of e-mail service providers, their longitudinal shifts, and the demographics of their customers. We demonstrate the growing dominance of a few third-party e-mail service providers and the decline in in-house e-mail provisioning.

**Contributions:**
1. We detail and justify a methodology to map published MX records to the identity of the mail service provider, providing significant accuracy improvements over existing approaches.
2. Using our methodology, we identify the top e-mail service providers and characterize their market share and customer demographics.
3. We provide a longitudinal analysis of mail service provider popularity over time and document the sources of market share shifts.
4. We explore the existence of national biases in the choice of mail service providers, specifically the extent to which domains in one country's top-level domain (TLD) use mail services from another country, thereby subjecting themselves to the latter's legal jurisdiction.

Our work not only provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of Internet e-mail provisioning but also lays a foundation for future analyses of e-mail infrastructure.

## 2 Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is part of a family of protocols for mail transmission, including SMTP [27], Extended SMTP (ESMTP) [18], and SMTP Service Extension for Authentication (SMTP-AUTH) [33].

In its basic form, an e-mail user operates a mail user agent (MUA) that uses ESMTP or SMTP-AUTH to submit e-mail messages to the sender’s mail submission agent (MSA). The MSA queues the message for delivery with the sender’s mail transfer agent (MTA) for relay to the recipient's mail infrastructure. The sending MTA uses the recipient’s DNS “Mail Exchanger” (MX) record to determine the location of the receiving MTA. The receiving MTA then either delivers the mail locally or places it into a queue for further processing.

#### 2.1.1 SMTP Procedures
All protocols in the SMTP family follow a similar procedure. A session starts when an SMTP client (either an MUA or an MTA) opens a connection to an SMTP server, which responds with a greeting message (banner message). The client then sends the EHLO (or HELO in earlier versions) command to the server, signaling its identity. The server responds with its domain name and a list of supported extensions. Additional messages may be exchanged for negotiating configuration options such as authentication.

#### 2.1.2 Mail Submission and Relaying
When SMTP is used for submitting a new message, the MUA typically authenticates itself using SMTP-AUTH. The server accepts transactions only after the sender presents appropriate credentials, often protected via a TLS session. In this mode, servers typically accept connections on TCP port 587, although ports 465 and 25 are also common.

For relaying a message, the sending MTA identifies the receiving MTA by parsing e-mail addresses and looking up the corresponding DNS MX records. The sending MTA then establishes a connection with the receiving MTA, typically using TCP port 25.

### 2.2 Mail Exchanger (MX) Records
The Mail Exchanger (MX) record specifies which MTAs handle inbound mail for a domain name and is published in the DNS zone of the domain. Multiple MX records can be configured with assigned preference numbers, with the lowest number having the highest priority. An MX record can resolve to completely separate infrastructure. For example, the MX record for ucsd.edu might resolve to an IP address owned and operated by ProofPoint, a mail filtering company.

### 2.3 STARTTLS and TLS Certificates
Modern SMTP implementations support the STARTTLS option, which allows the sending MTA to initiate a TLS connection with the receiving MTA. If the receiving MTA supports STARTTLS, it provides a TLS certificate for session confidentiality. The receiving MTA must obtain a signed certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA) for the MX domain name. While ideally, TLS certificates are validated by the sending MTA, SMTP sessions often continue even if the certificate does not validate.

### 2.4 Related Work
Despite the critical role of e-mail, there is limited contemporary analysis of e-mail infrastructure and its providers. Notable works include the 2015 papers by Durumeric et al. and Foster et al., which explored the use and configuration of privacy, authentication, and integrity mechanisms in e-mail delivery [13, 14]. Rijswijk et al. [37, 38] investigated the growth of top mail providers over a short period, while Afergan et al. [2] measured e-mail transmission loss, latency, and errors. Other research has focused on dangling DNS records and their impact on e-mail security [22, 29], and the vulnerabilities of third-party mail providers [9, 32].

## 3 Identifying Mail Providers
In this section, we discuss the challenges in identifying mail service providers, particularly the limitations of relying solely on MX records. We then present our priority-based approach for accurately mapping domains to their respective mail service providers.
