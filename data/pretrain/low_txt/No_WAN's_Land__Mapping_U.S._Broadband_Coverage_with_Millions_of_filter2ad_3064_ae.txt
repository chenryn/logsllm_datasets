### Coverage Determination Methodology

To determine if an address is covered, we apply the following criteria based on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) data and Broadband Availability Test (BAT) results:

1. **Local ISP Coverage**: An address is considered covered if a local ISP provides service to the address’s census block according to Form 477 data.
2. **Major ISP Coverage**: If no local ISP is available, an address is considered covered if all major ISPs providing service to the address’s census block according to Form 477 data return "not covered" for the address in their BAT.

We then compute the count of addresses covered according to the FCC’s data and the count of addresses covered according to the BAT. The address overstatement ratio is calculated as the ratio between these counts.

This method provides a conservative estimate of coverage overstatements by not making assumptions about an address’s coverage if there is no local ISP and BATs return a mix of unrecognized address, unknown response, or no coverage. The left-hand side of Table 5 presents the results from applying this method. A sensitivity analysis that relaxes the strict criteria is provided in Appendix I.

### Population with and without Broadband Access

We further estimate the population with and without broadband access using the same population adjusting formula as in Section 4.1, but summing over the census blocks within a state and using the address overstatement ratio. The right-hand side of Table 5 presents the results of this method.

### Coverage Overstatements

Table 5 presents the results of our analysis by state, urban and rural area designation, and speed tier. According to our analysis, 0.83% of Americans who the FCC data indicates have access to benchmark broadband service are not covered. This overstatement is consistent across all states, speed tiers, and area types. Assuming our results are nationally representative, this suggests that 2.5 million Americans lack access to broadband at benchmark speeds, exceeding the FCC estimates.

Our results diverge from the recent BroadbandNow report [33], which estimated overstatements for 6.5% of addresses in a sample and 21 million Americans nationally. We hypothesize that the disparity stems from differences in methodology and our deliberate caution in evaluating possible overstatements, at the risk of underestimating inaccuracy in the FCC’s data. For example, if we treat BAT unrecognized addresses and unknown responses as meaning an address has no coverage, we estimate a benchmark broadband overstatement for 3.80% of addresses in our dataset and 14 million Americans (see Appendix I).

### Overstatements in Rural Areas

FCC coverage overstatements are both proportionally and absolutely larger in rural areas than in urban areas. Across all nine states, 99.68% of Americans in urban areas that the FCC claims have benchmark broadband are covered according to BAT data, compared to 96.97% in rural areas. Despite approximately 80% of Americans living in urban areas, the overstatement in rural areas (310,070 people) is larger than in urban areas (139,957 people) at benchmark speeds [71]. This disproportionate overstatement in rural areas holds for each state.

### Overstatements of Competition

We estimate the extent to which FCC coverage data overstates broadband competition in each state (i.e., the number of providers available at an address). A broadband market with multiple participants benefits consumers through lower prices and greater reliability due to competition.

We begin with census blocks in our dataset that are covered by at least one major ISP. For each block, we count the major ISPs in Form 477 data, filter out addresses where any BAT returned "address unrecognized" or "response unknown," and set aside the block if it has no remaining addresses. We then calculate the average number of available providers for addresses in the block: the count of address-ISP combinations with coverage divided by the count of addresses. Finally, we compute a competition overstatement ratio for the block: the average number of available providers according to BAT data, divided by the number of major ISPs according to Form 477 data.

Figure 6 plots the distribution of the competition overstatement ratio for each state and by urban and rural areas. In urban areas, the FCC’s data does not appear to greatly overstate competition. In rural areas, however, there appears to be very significant overstatement of competition. For example, in Virginia, FCC data may double the number of actual providers for one in four census blocks.

### Relationship Between Overstatements and Rural, Low-Income, and Minority Communities

We conduct a regression analysis to examine the relationship between coverage overstatements and rural, low-income, and minority communities. We fit an ordinary least squares model at the census tract level. The dependent variable is the coverage overstatement ratio for the tract, following the method in Section 4.3. The independent variables include tract population, the proportion of the tract that is rural, the proportion of the population in the tract that lives in a household with an income below the federal poverty line, and the proportion of the tract population that is a minority. We also include an independent variable for each major ISP, with the value set to the proportion of blocks in the tract covered by the ISP according to Form 477 data, and a categorical variable for the state where the tract is located.

Table 6 shows variables with a statistically significant (p ≤ .05) correlation with coverage overstatements. The full regression results are presented in Appendix K. The results show that coverage overstatements correlate with a greater proportion of rural addresses and a greater proportion of the population that is a minority. The rural address proportion has the most negative coefficient of the independent variables in our analysis. However, the \( R^2 = 0.145 \) for our regression model, indicating a high level of variability in the data that is not explained by the factors we examined.

### Conclusion

In this work, we develop a methodology for using automated large-scale queries to ISP BATs to compile a broadband coverage dataset. We then compare the FCC’s broadband maps to our dataset, contributing the most rigorous large-scale evaluation of the FCC’s maps to date. Our results show that the FCC’s coverage data significantly overstates the availability of each ISP’s service, access to any broadband, connection speeds available to consumers, and competition in broadband markets. We also find that the FCC’s data disproportionately overstates coverage in rural and minority communities.

Our research highlights several promising directions for future work, including more granular speed measurements, national and international broadband availability measurements, and evaluating the accuracy of the FCC’s mobile coverage maps. Additionally, as the FCC transitions to the Digital Opportunity Data Collection, our results show that BATs are a promising direction for evaluating both the methods that ISPs use for future FCC coverage reports and whether ISPs are correctly implementing those methods.
