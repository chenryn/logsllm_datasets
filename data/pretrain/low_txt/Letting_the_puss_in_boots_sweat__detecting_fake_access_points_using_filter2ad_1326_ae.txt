### Optimized Text

The system, if available, measures the current temperature. The pairs of MAC address and clock skew, along with optional temperature information, form the fingerprints. A secure channel to the Trusted Service (TS) can be established in two ways:
1. If the Untrusted Access Point (UAP) provides free access to the Internet, the client uses this connectivity.
2. If free access is not possible (e.g., due to the need for credit card information), a side channel such as 3G can be used.

Encryption and authenticity are ensured using well-known certificate-based standards like SSL. To mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks on this channel by the UAP, the certificate can be hard-coded into the app. The client then sends the fingerprint via the secured channel to the TS. Based on the information provided by the client, the TS decides which verification method (SVM/2AP-T/2AP) to use and calculates a trustworthiness verdict, which can be either binary or score-based. The verdict is sent back to the client, allowing the user to decide whether to use the UAP or not. All fingerprints queried for verification are stored and integrated into the TS's assessment. As more users utilize the system, the base for this assessment broadens, enhancing its precision. This process establishes a reputation for the Access Points (APs).

A legitimate replacement of an AP by the operator will not cause confusion: the new device will have a different MAC address and will be recognized as a new AP in that environment. Our crowdsourced approach will automatically integrate this new AP and begin building its reputation. Note that an attacker could also integrate their AP in this way, but they would need to provide reliable long-term service to gain sufficient reputation.

This approach can be implemented without changing any standardized protocols and without requiring the cooperation of network operators. Instead, the incentive for using this system is shifted to users who prioritize security. In future work, we plan to implement this architecture and test its effectiveness in a real-world scenario.

Additionally, it would be possible to store the trained models of the SVM for a favored set of APs in the app itself. Verifying an environment against a trained SVM model requires only low computational resources and small storage capacities (our trained models are around 2–32KB in size).

### Conclusion

In this paper, we present a practical solution for reliably detecting faked access points. This is achieved by passively estimating the clock skew from information contained in management frames. We enhance the information content by considering the dependency on temperature, and our method completely eliminates the influence of the measuring device on the fingerprint. Thus, measurements performed by different clients become comparable. Interestingly, our method works even without explicit access to temperature information and protects against an attacker who selects a fake AP with a similar average clock skew.

Our method exploits an intrinsic physical property that provides the highest discriminability known so far for APs using standard client hardware. Simulating this property is much more complex than adjusting the average clock skew, even if the hardware is modified, making the attack practically infeasible.

Our approach yields a strong feature for passive remote physical device fingerprinting in wireless networks. Using only 50 observations for training, our method detects faked access points in 90% of all cases.

No currently deployed protection mechanism for public hotspots (e.g., web-based authentication) provides any security against the described threat. With our proposed architecture, it is possible to mitigate the danger without changing deployed systems or standard protocols.
