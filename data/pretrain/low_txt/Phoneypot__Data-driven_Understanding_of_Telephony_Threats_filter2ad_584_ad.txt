### Research Goals and Threat Information Collection

The primary objective of threat information collection and analysis is to develop effective defenses against these threats. Similarly, we aim to leverage the intelligence gathered from Phoneypot to enhance our defensive strategies. We will explore several options, including:

- Associating reputations with phone numbers, similar to the reputation systems used for IP addresses and domain names.
- Creating blacklists and whitelists of phone numbers.

However, it is important to note that spoofing of phone numbers is significantly easier and has been frequently detected. Our future work will focus on how best to utilize Phoneypot intelligence to detect such spoofing activities.

### Conclusion

Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting vulnerabilities in the IP telephony ecosystem to craft attacks using seemingly legitimate phone calls to scam users. The frequency of such incidents is rising at an alarming rate. While there are self-reported fraud complaint databases, such as 800notes and the FTC’s complaint datasets, these resources often suffer from delays between the actual fraud call and the registration of the complaint, lack of detailed intelligence, and inaccuracies due to the inclusion of unrelated abuse reports, such as email spam.

In this paper, we demonstrate the need to enhance these databases to address these issues. We explored the feasibility of using a honeypot to collect more accurate and timely intelligence about telephony attacks. We propose Phoneypot, the first and largest telephony honeypot, and present a concrete implementation. This telephony honeypot addresses several new challenges, which we illustrate through the use of phoneytokens.

We report on our experiences with 39,000 phoneytokens deployed over a seven-week period, during which Phoneypot received more than 1.3 million unsolicited calls. We were able to investigate and validate some of these calls using FTC complaint datasets and a proprietary database from Nomorobo, a robocall blocking service. Our findings indicate that older blocks of numbers tend to receive more calls compared to newer blocks. We also observed patterns of abuse, including debt collector and telemarketing calls, and clear evidence of telephony denial of service (TDoS) attacks.

By comparing the timestamps of phone number reports in the FTC fraud complaint database, we found many instances where Phoneypot received calls from fraudulent numbers before they were reported in the FTC dataset. This demonstrates that Phoneypot can complement existing data collection mechanisms related to telephony abuse.

### Future Work

Several issues related to telephony threats remain to be explored. In the future, we will investigate the seeding of phoneytokens and develop defenses against various threats.
