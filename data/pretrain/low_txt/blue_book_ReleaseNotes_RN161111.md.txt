### New Features:
- **Subscription Security:**
  - **JEA Server Lockdown:** A proof of concept (PoC) has been completed for a locked-down JEA jump-box. This is based on the security baseline applied to Windows Server 2016. A VHD is available for your team to test.

- **Dev/CICD Kit:**
  - **SVTs:**
    - Added a new module for testing Logic App Connectors.

- **Alerting & Monitoring:**
  - Completed a PoC for an "auto-remediation" scenario. In this PoC, an OMS-side alert notifies a configured email address and independently triggers an automation via a web hook to remediate the situation. The alert condition used in the PoC was "TDE got turned off." We welcome your input on which scenarios to prioritize for auto-remediation.

- **Central View of Control Coverage (PoC):**
  - Displays controls checked by various modules of the DevOps Kit. This is a live feed as the same rules are also used by the DevOps Kit scripts at runtime.

- **Telemetry:**
  - Integrated telemetry support across all features in the DevOps Kit. This will help us measure adoption, make quality improvements, and track the impact of the toolkit on risk reduction.

### Feature Improvements and Fixes:
- **Subscription Security:**
  - **SS-ASCConfig:** Implemented workarounds for two known issues:
    1. Top-level ASC policy changes do not percolate down to resource groups if a prior policy exists at the RG level.
    2. Even though contact details have been populated at the subscription policy level, ASC continues to warn about addressing the task.

- **Dev/CICD Kit:**
  - **SVT Enhancements:**
    - Significantly improved the structure of PowerShell module output and logs.
    - Added additional test cases for some services (SQL, App Services).
  - **Refactoring:**
    - Refactored all SS-*/TCP-* SVTs to support centralized rules and standardized console display and log outputs.
