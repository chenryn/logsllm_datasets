Bug

**What is the current behavior?**  
When setting both `padding` and `paddingTop` simultaneously, and then re-rendering with only `padding`, the `style` attribute does not update correctly. A similar issue occurs with the `border` property. I suspect that this problem may also affect the `margin` property, although I have not tested it.

Example: [CodePen](http://codepen.io/testerez/pen/pNRQjW?editors=0010)

**What is the expected behavior?**  
The style of the DOM element should reflect the most recent render and should not be influenced by previous style values.

**Which versions of React, and which browser/OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**  
This issue has been observed on Chrome 54, using React versions 15.4 and 15.3.2. It is unclear whether this worked in earlier versions of React.
