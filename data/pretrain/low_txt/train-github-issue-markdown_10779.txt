## Feature Request: Alpha-dependent Template Matching (matchTemplate)

It would be highly beneficial to incorporate alpha channel support into the `matchTemplate` function. This enhancement would allow transparent areas in the template to be ignored during the matching process, thereby improving the accuracy of the results. A detailed discussion on this topic can be found on Stack Overflow:
