# Privileged Access Security Levels

This document outlines the security levels for a [privileged access strategy](privileged-access-strategy.md). For a roadmap on how to adopt this strategy, see the [Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP)](security-rapid-modernization-plan.md). For implementation guidance, refer to [Privileged Access Deployment](privileged-access-deployment.md).

These security levels are designed to provide clear and straightforward technical guidance, enabling organizations to quickly deploy essential protections. The privileged access strategy acknowledges that while organizations have unique needs, custom solutions can introduce complexity, leading to higher costs and lower security over time. To balance these requirements, the strategy offers prescriptive guidance for each level, allowing organizations to choose when specific roles must meet the criteria of each level.

Simplicity is key to ensuring that people understand the strategy and reduce the risk of confusion and errors. While the underlying technology may be complex, it is crucial to keep the approach simple rather than creating difficult-to-support custom solutions. For more information, see [Security Design Principles](/azure/architecture/framework/security/security-principles).

Designing solutions that cater to the needs of administrators and end users simplifies the process for them. Solutions that are easy for security and IT personnel to build, assess, and maintain (with automation where possible) lead to fewer security mistakes and more reliable security assurances. 

The recommended privileged access security strategy employs a simple three-level system of assurances, designed for easy deployment across accounts, devices, intermediaries, and interfaces.

![Increase attacker cost with each level of security investment](./media/privileged-access-security-levels/drive-attacker-cost-with-strategic-investments.png)

Each successive level increases the cost for attackers, with additional investments in Defender for Cloud. The levels are designed to target the 'sweet spots' where defenders get the most return (increased attacker cost) for each security investment they make.

Each role in your environment should be mapped to one of these levels, with the option to increase the level over time as part of a security improvement plan. Each profile is clearly defined as a technical configuration and automated where possible to ease deployment and speed up security protections. For implementation details, see the article, [Privileged Access Roadmap](security-rapid-modernization-plan.md).

## Security Levels

The security levels used in this strategy are:

### Enterprise

- **Enterprise Security** is suitable for all enterprise users and productivity scenarios. In the rapid modernization plan, it also serves as the starting point for specialized and privileged access, progressively building on the security controls in enterprise security.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > Weaker security configurations exist but are not recommended by Microsoft for enterprise organizations due to the skills and resources available to attackers. For information on what attackers can buy from each other on the dark markets and average prices, see the video [Top 10 Best Practices for Azure Security](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/video-hub/top-10-best-practices-for-azure-security/m-p/1698837).

### Specialized

- **Specialized Security** provides enhanced security controls for roles with elevated business impact (if compromised by an attacker or malicious insider).
  
  Your organization should document criteria for specialized and privileged accounts (e.g., potential business impact exceeding $1M USD) and identify all roles and accounts meeting that criteria. Specialized roles typically include:
  
  - **Developers** of business-critical systems.
  - **Sensitive Business Roles** such as SWIFT terminal users, researchers with access to sensitive data, financial reporting personnel, payroll administrators, approvers for sensitive business processes, and other high-impact roles.
  - **Executives** and personal assistants/administrative assistants who regularly handle sensitive information.
  - **High-Impact Social Media Accounts** that could damage the company's reputation.
  - **Sensitive IT Admins** with significant privileges and impact, but not enterprise-wide. This group includes administrators of individual high-impact workloads (e.g., ERP administrators, banking administrators, help desk/tech support roles).

  Specialized Account security also serves as an interim step for privileged security, which further builds on these controls. See [Privileged Access Roadmap](security-rapid-modernization-plan.md) for the recommended order of progression.

### Privileged

- **Privileged Security** is the highest level of security, designed for roles that could cause a major incident and potential material damage to the organization if compromised. This level typically includes technical roles with administrative permissions on most or all enterprise systems and sometimes includes a few business-critical roles.
  
  Privileged accounts prioritize security, with productivity defined as the ability to perform sensitive job tasks securely. These roles will not have the ability to do both sensitive work and general productivity tasks (e.g., web browsing, installing and using any app) using the same account or device. They will have highly restricted accounts and workstations with increased monitoring for anomalous activity that could indicate attacker activity.
  
  Privileged access security roles typically include:
  
  - Microsoft Entra Global Administrators and [related roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference)
  - Other identity management roles with administrative rights to an enterprise directory, identity synchronization systems, federation solutions, virtual directories, privileged identity/access management systems, or similar.
  - Roles with membership in the following on-premises Active Directory groups:
    - Enterprise Admins
    - Domain Admins
    - Schema Admin
    - BUILTIN\Administrators
    - Account Operators
    - Backup Operators
    - Print Operators
    - Server Operators
    - Domain Controllers
    - Read-only Domain Controllers
    - Group Policy Creator Owners
    - Cryptographic Operators
    - Distributed COM Users
    - Sensitive on-premises Exchange groups (including Exchange Windows Permissions and Exchange Trusted Subsystem)
    - Other Delegated Groups - Custom groups created by your organization to manage directory operations.
    - Any local administrator for an underlying operating system or cloud service tenant hosting the above capabilities, including:
      - Members of the local administrators group
      - Personnel who know the root or built-in administrator password
      - Administrators of any management or security tool with agents installed on those systems
