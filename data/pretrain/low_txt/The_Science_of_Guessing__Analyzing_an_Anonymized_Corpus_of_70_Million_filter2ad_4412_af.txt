### Data Analysis and Findings

Upon analyzing our dataset, we identified "global passwords" that are popular across all observed subgroups. For instance, the most common password had a probability of at least 0.14% in every subpopulation. Some overall popular passwords, however, were very rare in certain subpopulations. The third most common password, with an overall probability of 0.1%, occurred nearly 100 times less frequently in some subpopulations. Nevertheless, there were eight passwords that appeared with a probability of at least 0.01% in every subpopulation. Without access to the raw passwords, we speculate that these may be numeric passwords, as they are widely used and easily internationalized.

Despite the existence of globally popular passwords, our analysis indicates that dictionary specificity can significantly impact efficiency. For example, the following table shows efficiency losses of up to 25% from dictionaries tailored to people from different English-speaking countries:

| Dictionary | US | UK | CA | AU |
|------------|----|----|----|----|
| s          | 8.2% | 6.6% | 7.4% | 7.2% |
| u          | 5.4% | 6.9% | 5.5% | 5.6% |
| k          | 8.8% | 7.9% | 9.9% | 8.7% |
| u          | 7.4% | 7.2% | 7.6% | 8.8% |
| a          | 8.1% | 5.5% | 8.8% | 7.5% |

We also observed comparable efficiency losses based on age:

| Dictionary | 13-20 | 21-34 | 35-54 | 55+ |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|-----|
| l          | 8.4%  | 7.3%  | 5.4%  | 5.4% |
| a          | 7.8%  | 7.9%  | 5.8%  | 5.8% |
| b          | 7.1%  | 7.3%  | 6.4%  | 6.8% |
| o          | 6.5%  | 6.7%  | 6.1%  | 7.3% |
| g          | 7.9%  | 7.8%  | 6.2%  | 6.5% |

Efficiency losses were also noted based on service usage:

| Dictionary | Retail | Chat | Media | Mail |
|------------|--------|------|-------|------|
| l          | 7.0%   | 6.9% | 5.7%  | 6.7% |
| i          | 5.6%   | 8.4% | 5.6%  | 8.0% |
| a          | 6.6%   | 7.8% | 6.0%  | 7.5% |
| t          | 5.6%   | 8.3% | 5.6%  | 8.2% |
| e          | 6.0%   | 8.3% | 5.8%  | 8.1% |

### Concluding Remarks

By establishing sound metrics and rigorously analyzing the largest password corpus to date, we aim to provide tools and data of lasting significance. As a rule of thumb for security engineers, passwords provide roughly equivalent security to 10-bit random strings against an optimal online attacker trying a few popular guesses for a large list of accounts. An attacker who can manage 10 guesses per account, typically within the realm of rate-limiting mechanisms, will compromise around 1% of accounts, similar to the success rate against random 10-bit strings. Against an optimal attacker performing unrestricted brute force and aiming to break half of all available accounts, passwords appear to be roughly equivalent to 20-bit random strings. This means that no practical amount of iterated hashing can prevent an adversary from breaking a large number of accounts given the opportunity for offline search. An important caveat is that these passwords were chosen with very few restrictions; a stricter password selection policy might produce distributions with significantly higher resistance to guessing.

These numbers represent a minimal benchmark that any serious password replacement scheme should aim to decisively clear. The enormous gap between real password distributions and the theoretical space of passwords highlights why research proposals involving human-chosen secrets should estimate security using metrics like \(\tilde{\mu}_\alpha\) and \(\tilde{G}_\alpha\) to model partial guessing attacks. Where possible, comparisons to past empirical estimates of guessing attacks should be provided, as we have done with Figures 1 and 6.

The most troubling finding of our study is the minimal variation in password distributions, with all populations of users producing similar skewed distributions and effective security varying by no more than a few bits. Factors increasing security motivation, such as registering a payment card, only seem to nudge users away from the weakest passwords, and a limited natural experiment on actively encouraging stronger passwords has made little difference. Passwords have been argued to be "secure enough" for the web, with users rationally choosing weak passwords for accounts of little importance. However, these results may undermine this explanation, as user choice does not vary greatly with changing security concerns. This may indicate an underlying problem with passwords that users are not willing or able to manage how difficult their passwords are to guess.
