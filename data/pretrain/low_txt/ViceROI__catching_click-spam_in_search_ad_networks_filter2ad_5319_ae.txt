### Evolution of Click-Spam and Viceroi's Robustness

A natural next question is how click-spam may evolve. Given the insight from Section 4 that click-spammers must achieve a higher ROI than ethical publishers, we believe the core Viceroi approach—comparing publisher revenue per user distributions against a benchmark set of ethical publishers—will remain effective. However, finer details, such as the sensitivity to the (currently auto-tuned) τ threshold, may increase as click-spammers accept lower revenues to operate within the margins.

#### Sybil Publishers

To avoid detection by Viceroi, one strategy for reducing apparent revenue per user is for a publisher to appear as multiple entities (Sybils), each generating a fraction of the original revenue. Such attempts have been reported [4]. If the Sybils share the same bank account to receive ad network payments, they can be easily recombined. Acquiring multiple bank accounts to receive payments is a high-overhead and high-risk task [16].

#### Sybil Users

Another method to reduce apparent revenue per user is for the click-spammer to make each user they control appear as multiple users. This approach does not apply to click-spam mechanisms where the click-spammer cannot run arbitrary code on the user’s device (e.g., arbitrage, parked domains, and in-network search hijacking). Even when the click-spammer can run arbitrary code, their ability to inflate the user count depends on how the ad network counts users. Certain identifiers, like IP addresses, are difficult to fake [10].

#### Collusion

One way for a click-spammer to operate within the margins is to collude with an ethical publisher. The idea is for the click-spammer to add ethically acquired cover traffic to avoid detection. We simulate this by pairing a click-spammer from our dataset with a randomly chosen ethical publisher with a similar number of users. We perform a parameter sweep where the click-spammer replaces x% of their users with users acquired from the (now no-longer) ethical publisher, with x ranging from 0% to 100%.

- At x = 0, the simulated publisher is identical to the original click-spammer, and Viceroi flags it.
- At x = 100, the simulated publisher is identical to the original ethical publisher, and Viceroi does not flag it.

We are interested in determining the point at which the transition occurs. Figure 9 shows the position of the simulated publisher relative to the auto-tuned value of τ. Positions to the left of τ are flagged by Viceroi as click-spam, while positions to the right are not. We find that as the simulated publisher gradually adds more ethically acquired users, their position drifts closer to the τ threshold, falling right on the boundary when the simulated publisher has a roughly 50-50 split between ethical clicks and click-spam. As the fraction of ethical clicks starts dominating, Viceroi stops flagging the publisher.

We believe this behavior is desirable for the ad network as it creates a positive incentive for click-spammers to reform their ways. A click-spammer would make no revenue from click-spam if operating in the shaded region, but if they grow their users in line with how an ethical publisher acquires users, they would exit the shaded region and start making money ethically. Over time, the threshold may be moved farther to the right to further incentivize good behavior.

#### Brute Force

Another strategy for operating within the margins is for the click-spammer to dramatically increase the size of the botnet while making the bots click less. This increases fixed costs while holding revenue constant, effectively decreasing the revenue per user, which is necessary for the click-spammer to exit the shaded region in Figure 2 to avoid getting flagged. To determine the required botnet size, we simulate botnets up to two orders of magnitude larger than those flagged by Viceroi.

Figure 10 shows the position of the simulated click-spammer relative to the auto-tuned value of τ. The current botnet size (labeled as 1x) is comfortably in the region flagged by Viceroi. As we increase it by an order of magnitude, the simulated click-spammer moves closer to the τ threshold. With two orders of magnitude larger a botnet, the click-spammer is on the borderline. Beyond this, Viceroi’s current choice of τ does not flag the spammer. Note that in the process, the click-spammer’s fixed costs increase commensurately by two orders of magnitude while holding revenue constant, resulting in a profit drop of up to 99%. Whether click-spam through botnets will remain economically viable after such a significant drop in profits remains uncertain. Nevertheless, we believe that the learned threshold τ has sufficient headroom to handle significantly larger botnets than today.

### Summary

In this paper, we present Viceroi, a general approach to catching click-spam. It is designed around the invariant that click-spam is a business (for click-spammers) that needs to deliver high ROI to offset the risk of getting caught. We evaluate our approach on a large real-world ad-network dataset and identify six different classes of click-spam linked to conversion fraud, ad injection, search hijacking, malware, arbitrage, and parked domains. We also find evidence of many sub-classes of these types, including automated and semi-automated conversion fraud, hijacking through DNS interception, and multiple publishers benefiting from each of these models. The Viceroi approach flags click-spam through all these mechanisms without any tuning knobs, performs well on ROC and precision-recall curves, and is resilient against click-spammers using larger botnets over time. Furthermore, our approach is among the best existing filters deployed by the ad-network today while being far more general. We also introduce the novel bluff form technique for catching conversion fraud.
