### Rates and Scenarios in Experimental Simulations

In the experimental simulations, we explore various scenarios, with a particular focus on the study of temporary inconsistencies within a new distributed detection architecture. These extensions are being developed as part of a cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture proposed in [30]. Our ongoing work includes the deployment of distributed detection agents on all nodes and the extension of authentication techniques, such as TESLA [7], for the authentication of forwarded messages. This will help us to resolve the assumptions in our model and enable its implementation on more realistic platforms.

### Related Work

Most Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) aim to detect malicious packet dropping, which can affect both routing and data packets. We briefly describe these approaches, as they address one of several intrusive behaviors that can be used to disrupt MANET routing. A general packet drop detector for MANETs is described in [18]. Rao and Kesidis [9] present a statistical approach using estimated congestion at intermediate nodes to identify malicious packet dropping behavior. The works in [1], [2], and [5] use reputation-based mechanisms to isolate misbehaving nodes and rely only on trusted and verifiably good nodes. Ramanujan et al. [10] propose a system to detect, avoid, and recover from attacks targeting the routing function in ad hoc networks, including a distributed firewall mechanism, an algorithm for detecting and recovering from intruder-induced path failures, and a wireless router extension architecture.

The case for a cooperative IDS architecture for mobile ad hoc networks was first made by Zhang and Lee [14], who discussed anomaly detection as the primary approach. Huang and Lee [3] present a cooperative, cluster-based architecture designed to support statistical anomaly detection. However, the effectiveness of statistical anomaly detection in MANETs is uncertain due to dynamic topologies, noisy and intermittent wireless communications, and the lack of concentration points for traffic analysis. Subhadhrabandhu et al. [29] evaluate several strategies for placing IDS modules for misuse detection in mobile ad hoc networks. Sterne et al. [30] introduce a cooperative intrusion detection architecture tailored to the unique challenges of MANETs.

Several approaches also address secure routing in MANETs, including cryptographic and IDS methods. Cryptographic approaches, such as those in [4], [7], [13], [11], and [8], propose authentication protocols for routing control data message exchanges. For example, Ariadne [4] uses TESLA [7] to secure the DSR routing protocol, while asymmetric cryptography is proposed in [13] to secure the AODV routing protocol. The ARAN routing protocol [11] requires a trusted certificate authority, and [8] proposes a secure link state routing for mobile ad hoc networks by attaching certified keys to link state updates.

IDS approaches focus on detecting attacks on specific routing protocols. Gwalami et al. [17] employ a stateful analysis of AODV control packet streams based on the State Transition Analysis Technique (STAT) [24]. In this implementation, sensors are deployed individually in a subset of nodes and do not communicate with each other. Ning and Sun [6] analyze insider attacks on the AODV protocol, and a formal specification of the AODV protocol is presented in [28] to detect implementation bugs. A specification-based IDS approach for monitoring the AODV routing protocol is proposed in [12].

### Conclusion

By analyzing the OLSR routing specification, we define normal OLSR routing behavior and list possible attack mechanisms from a single attacker. Based on this, nodes retrieve routing information and maintain their routing tables correctly using Hello and TC messages. We develop constraints on these messages to ensure the integrity of routing tables at all nodes. We also provide a proof of satisfaction for these constraints and implement the constraints and example attacks on the Glomosim simulation platform.

In future work, we aim to implement and deploy the model for more realistic MANET scenarios. This includes developing a message exchange model to allow distributed detectors to have the required minimum local routing information through message exchanges between local detectors, enhancing the model to handle message loss, delay, and false alarms, and adding new constraints to monitor the forwarding behavior of OLSR TC messages and normal unicast packet forwarding. Our ultimate goal is to address all assumptions in the model for a realistic implementation.
