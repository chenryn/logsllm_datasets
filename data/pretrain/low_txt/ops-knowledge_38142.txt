We are currently exploring transport and protocol solutions and plan to conduct a series of performance tests. Before proceeding, I would like to check with the community to see if similar evaluations have already been performed.

Specifically, we are interested in server performance tests for simple echo services, as well as serialization and deserialization for various message sizes. We aim to compare the following technologies on a Linux platform: EJB3, Thrift, and Protocol Buffers. The primary programming languages we will use are Java, C/C++, Python, and PHP.

**Update:** I am still very interested in this topic. If anyone has conducted additional benchmarks, please share your findings. Additionally, I have come across an interesting benchmark that shows compressed JSON performing comparably or even better than Thrift and Protocol Buffers. Therefore, I am also including JSON in this comparison.

One of the high-priority items on my to-do list is to port Google's internal Protocol Buffer performance benchmark. This involves converting confidential message formats into generic ones and doing the same for the data. Once this is completed, we can build the same messages in Thrift and then compare their performance.

In other words, while I do not have the data for you yet, I anticipate having it within the next couple of weeks.
