There appears to be an issue with the "Show the Local Weather" challenge. Although I haven't manually altered most of the challenges, I suspect this problem may not be isolated to just this one.

As a privacy-conscious user, I use HTTPS Everywhere, which blocks insecure resources. This can cause CodePen projects to fail if they attempt to load content over HTTP instead of HTTPS.

To resolve this, please update any instances of `http:` to `https:` in the resource URLs.
