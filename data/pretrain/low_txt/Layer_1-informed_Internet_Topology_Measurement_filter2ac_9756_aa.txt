## Abstract
Understanding the topological structure of the Internet remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that physical maps of service provider infrastructure can effectively guide topology discovery using network-layer TTL-limited measurements. Our goal is to use layer 3-based probing to broadly identify Internet infrastructure with fixed geographic locations, such as Points of Presence (POPs), Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), and other hosting facilities.

We begin by comparing over 1.5 years of TTL-limited probe data from the Ark project with maps of service provider infrastructure from the Internet Atlas project. We find that the service provider map data identifies substantially more nodes and links compared to the probe data. Next, we introduce a new method for probe-based measurement of physical infrastructure called POPsicle, which carefully selects probe source-destination pairs. Our extensive measurement study using existing "looking glass" vantage points distributed throughout the Internet demonstrates that POPsicle reveals 2.4 times more physical node locations than standard probing methods. To further validate the deployability of POPsicle, we conduct tests at an IXP, showing that it can identify more physical node locations compared to standard layer 3 probes and can be used to measure thousands of networks worldwide.

## Introduction
Efforts to map the Internet's topological structure have been driven by various applications, including improving performance, security, and robustness. Despite these motivations, accurately and comprehensively mapping the Internet has remained challenging due to its vast size, distributed ownership, and dynamic nature. The most widely used approach to Internet mapping has been based on network-layer measurements using TTL-limited probes. While significant progress has been made in using these measurements, they are inherently tied to the management policies and operational objectives of service providers, which may not align with comprehensive and accurate mapping.

In this context, we define an "Internet map" as a collection of physical conduits, such as optical fiber bundles, and their termination points in buildings housing routing and switching equipment. Several recent projects have begun to assemble repositories of physical Internet maps, which reflect the ground truth of service provider infrastructure. These physical maps contrast with network-layer maps generated from layer 3 probes, which ideally reflect timely and dynamic aspects of network topology.

Our hypothesis is that physical maps can guide and reinforce the process of collecting layer 3 probe data, expanding the scope of physical infrastructure captured in network-layer maps. This leads to two key research questions: (i) how do physical layer maps compare and contrast with network-layer maps? and (ii) how can probe methods be improved to reveal a larger portion of physical infrastructure?

## Related Work
Creating maps of the Internet's topology has been a long-standing interest in the research community. Early efforts focused on cataloging all nodes and links, but the rapid growth of the Internet rendered this approach impractical. Since then, significant effort has been made to use layer 3 TTL-limited probes for network mapping, with some studies focusing on developing comprehensive network-layer views and others on improving probing techniques. Recent efforts have addressed inaccuracies in probe-based network mapping, including the effects of IXPs and network virtualization techniques like MPLS.

The targeting problem, a focus of our work, has been informed by prior studies analyzing the importance of measurement infrastructure in Internet topology mapping. Our work differs in that we aim to use layer 3 probes to identify specific infrastructure targets.

## Datasets
### Physical Topology Data
We use the latest maps from service providers collected as part of the Internet Atlas project, which provides geographically anchored representations of the physical Internet, including nodes, conduits/links, and relevant metadata. The current repository contains geocoded physical infrastructure data of over 425 ISPs around the world, with detailed geographic information for 7 Tier-1 and 71 non-Tier-1/regional networks in North America, consisting of 2611 POPs and 3588 links.

### Network-layer Topology Data
We use traceroute data collected as part of the CAIDA's Archipelago (Ark) project, which includes measurements from 77 monitoring systems distributed globally to all routed /24 prefixes in the IPv4 Internet. These measurements are subject to various network management policies, which can limit the scope of the data.

### DNS Data
We use the IPv4 Routed /24 DNS Names Dataset, which provides fully-qualified domain names for IP addresses seen in the Ark traces.

### Scope of Comparison Study
Our analysis of Ark data covers a 19-month period from September 2011 to March 2013, contemporaneous with data collection in Atlas. We extract internal network IP addresses and links from each traceroute, merge the interface/link lists, and join the list of interface IPs to their corresponding DNS entries.

## Data Analysis
### Network-layer Data Analysis
We describe a two-step mapping algorithm to associate physical locations with IP address interfaces obtained from processing network-layer traceroute data. The key idea is to translate location-based patterns in DNS names to physical locations. Challenges include out-of-date or misconfigured DNS names and ambiguities in naming conventions. We use heuristics to avoid these problems and disambiguate location hints.

### Algorithm
The algorithm for developing a network-layer map from raw traceroute data takes four inputs:
