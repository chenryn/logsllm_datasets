**Objective:**
- Rapid assessment of radiation signatures in noninvasive biofluids to aid in assigning appropriate medical treatments for acute radiation syndrome (ARS) and allocating limited resources after a nuclear disaster.

**Methodology:**
- Global metabolomics was used to differentiate temporal effects in nonhuman primate (NHP) urine and serum small molecule signatures after a 4 Gy total body gamma irradiation.
- Random Forests analysis was applied to separate days (1 – 60) post-exposure.

**Results:**
- Eight compounds involved in protein metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation, DNA base deamination, and general energy metabolism were identified in each biofluid.
- The greatest perturbations were observed at 1 day in urine, with increases in carnitine, acylcarnitines, xanthine, creatine, 7-methylguanine, and dimethylarginine.
- Changes in serum metabolite concentrations were more dynamic (1 – 21 days), including carnitine, acylcarnitines, guanine, oleamide, and hypoxanthine.
- A targeted multiplex assay validated a six-compound panel (hypoxanthine, carnitine, acetylcarnitine, proline, taurine, and citrulline) previously identified in a training cohort at 7 days post-exposure.
- Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated high sensitivity and specificity for carnitine and acetylcarnitine (urine, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.99) and taurine, carnitine, and hypoxanthine (serum, AUC = 0.95).

**Conclusion:**
- Mass spectrometry (MS) platforms are effective in differentiating time post-exposure and acquiring reliable quantitative biomarker panels for classifying exposed individuals.

- Guro Giskeødegård, NTNU, Norway

**Co-Authors:**
- Feng Wang, Julia Debik, Trygve Andreassen, Leslie R. Euceda, Tonje H. Haukaas, Hartmut Schäfer, Tone F. Bathen

**Objective:**
- To explore the effects of repeated freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) on the concentrations of lipoprotein parameters and metabolites in serum and urine samples.

**Methodology:**
- Serum and urine samples from two sets of 20 healthy donors were subjected to 1–5 FTCs.
- Samples were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy, and lipoprotein parameters and metabolites were quantified using a commercial analytical platform.
- Principal component analysis (PCA) and Wilcoxon tests were used to assess systematic changes related to FTCs.

**Results:**
- PCA showed no systematic changes related to FTCs, and samples from the same donor were closely clustered, indicating higher between-subject variation than within-subject variation.
- Coefficients of variation were small (<2.1%, <1.4%, and <2.2% for lipoprotein parameters, and serum and urine metabolites, respectively).
- Only five lipoprotein parameters (VLCH, VLFC, V1CH, V4CH, and V3FC) differed significantly between FTC 3 and 4 (p-values < 0.05).

**Conclusion:**
- Five FTCs did not significantly alter the concentrations of serum and urine metabolites and introduced only minimal changes to serum lipoprotein parameters evaluated by the NMR-based platform.

**Co-Authors:**
- H. S. Jónasdóttir, R. S. Sigurðardóttir, S. Halldórsson, G. G. Haraldsson, Óttar Rolfsson

**Objective:**
- To compare the total free fatty acid (FFA) and lipid profiles of acellular cod skin (ACS) to human cadaver skin (HCS) and two grafts of bovine origin.

**Methodology:**
- FFA quantification was performed by GC-FID, and lipid profile analysis was conducted by untargeted UPLC-MS/MS.
- Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised partial least squares (PLS) analysis were used to differentiate the lipid composition of the materials.

**Results:**
- ACS contained significantly higher omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) than all other tested grafts, with percentages exceeding 20% and 30% of the total FAs content, respectively.
- HCS primarily contained omega-6 PUFAs, while the two bovine grafts had insignificant PUFA amounts.
- Approximately 50 lipids from positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes were identified as the most distinctive between the four materials.
- Phosphatidylcholine containing 20:5 and 22:6 omega-3 PUFAs was characteristic of the ACS grafts.

**Conclusion:**
- The lipid and fatty acid content of ACS is distinct from other wound grafting materials, and the high omega-3 PUFA content may be associated with positive wound healing mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory activity, cell migration, and stimulation.

**Objective:**
- To elucidate the molecular action of traditional herbal medicine (THM) by comprehensive profiling of THM components and their bio-conversion.

**Methodology:**
- A data-independent (non-targeted) strategy, named DAC-Met (Differential Annotation of Converted Metabolites), was developed to explore metabolized plasma components using high-resolution mass spectrometry.
- As a showcase, the effect of “maoto,” a mixture of ephedra herb, apricot kernel, cinnamon bark, and glycyrrhiza root, was studied.
- Maoto was administered to four healthy volunteers, and blood samples were collected before and after treatment at seven time points.

**Results:**
- Plasma metabolome analyses revealed maoto-derived metabolites, including known major components (ephedrine, prunasin, cinnamic acid, and glycyrrhetinic acid).
- Using the mass difference of major bio-conversions, the structure of 11 unidentified metabolites was estimated, and 4 were later confirmed with authentic standards.
- The metabolic pathway of maoto components was reconstructed, and their kinetic profiles were determined.
- Many components showed rapid absorption and elimination, but glycyrrhetinic acid and related conjugates became prominent 4 hours after administration.

**Conclusion:**
- The converted metabolites and their diverse kinetics reveal the complex mechanism of THM action, exemplifying the potential of the DAC-Met strategy for natural product research.
