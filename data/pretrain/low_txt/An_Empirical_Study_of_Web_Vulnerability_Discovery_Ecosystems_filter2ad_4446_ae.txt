### Mathematical Formulation

The following equations represent the accumulated number of white hats and peer organizations on a platform over time for organization \(i\):

\[ M_i = \sum_{k=2}^{T_i} (N_{Wk} - N_{W(k-1)}) (T_i - k + 1) \]
\[ M_i = \sum_{k=2}^{T_i} (N_{Ok} - N_{O(k-1)}) (T_i - k + 1) \]

Here, \( T_i \) is the number of months for the bounty program. \( N_{Wk} \) and \( N_{Ok} \) are the accumulated number of white hats and the number of peer organizations, respectively, at the \( k \)-th month for organization \( i \).

### Regression Analysis

Table 6 presents three variations of the regression model. Across all three models, we find a highly significant positive correlation between the expected reward offered and the number of vulnerabilities reported per month by the organization. Specifically, a $100 increase in the expected vulnerability reward is associated with an additional 3 vulnerabilities reported per month.

In models (2) and (3), there is a significant negative correlation between the Alexa rank and the number of vulnerabilities. This suggests that the rank may influence the attractiveness of a website to white hats. However, it is also possible that less popular websites are generally simpler in design and implementation, leading to fewer vulnerabilities. For model (3), we hypothesize that higher average platform manpower would attract more attention from white hats, resulting in more vulnerability reports. However, the analysis does not provide a conclusive answer, possibly due to the exclusion of invitation-only programs and a limited sample size.

### Model Application

The quantified model can assist organizations in determining their bug bounty policies and attracting effective white hat participation. Offering higher rewards and running the program for a longer period contributes to a higher number of reports. The model also aids in the security assessment discussed in Section 4.3.6. Nonetheless, our regression model is just the first step toward modeling the dynamics of the web vulnerability discovery ecosystem. It could be extended with more independent variables, such as the business type of organizations (see Section 4.3.3) or the expected rewards from peer organizations in the ecosystem.

## Discussion

### Importance of Disclosure

Based on our analysis, we believe that disclosing important information about vulnerability discovery, such as resolve times, bounty amounts, and detailed reports, is crucial for the success of a web vulnerability discovery ecosystem. For the white hat community, more disclosed information enables them to learn and improve, and potentially make better decisions on target selection, as discussed in Section 4.2.4. Transparency can also reduce conflicts between organizations and white hats regarding the validity of reports or the reasonableness of bounty amounts. For organizations, greater transparency allows the public (e.g., Internet users, cyber-insurance providers) to better assess the security of an organization (Section 4.3.6). Disclosure is also vital for the research community to address challenging issues and future research questions. Platforms like Wooyun, which have a delayed full disclosure policy, also encourage organizations to fix their reports sooner.

However, there are potential drawbacks to disclosing vulnerabilities, such as the leakage of critical information that can be exploited by black hats. An ideal disclosure policy must balance the benefits and risks to the ecosystem or a specific organization. Some programs, like those on HackerOne, disclose only a subset of their vulnerabilities, while the GitHub bounty program discloses data about every vulnerability but redacts certain details. Further analysis of the benefits and risks of disclosing vulnerability information and designing improved disclosure policies is important future work.

### Potential Incentive Structure Evolution

Our study shows that monetary incentives increase the number of vulnerability reports (Section 4.3.7). We anticipate that more organizations will start paying bounties as they join vulnerability disclosure ecosystems and compete for the limited attention of white hats. The average bounty amount is likely to rise to attract more white hats and compensate for the increasing cost of discovering vulnerabilities. High reward amounts can also signal an organization's strong security practices to the public, similar to the proposal in [30].

Many organizations, especially small ones with limited revenues, may struggle to maintain competitive bounty levels. It has been suggested that organizations could start with no bounty and gradually increase the reward level to manage the initial surge of reports, including many invalid submissions [27]. Organizations that cannot afford bounties can offer other forms of incentives, such as reputation scores, hall-of-fame memberships, or public disclosure.

### Encouraging White Hat Participation

Increasing the size of the white hat community allows more organizations to be covered and more vulnerabilities to be found (see Section 4.2.2). A larger white hat community might also decrease the cost of running bounty programs for organizations, similar to the increase in supply in any economic market. Therefore, regulations that hinder collaboration between white hats and organizations are likely detrimental. One example is the proposed update of the Wassenaar Arrangement, which aims to control the export of intrusion software. The overly broad definition of intrusion software could limit white hat participation [29], considering the global nature of the white hat community [4, 12].

To encourage more white hats to join the ecosystem, organizations can offer first-time bonuses, organize capture-the-flag activities, and design customized services, such as target selection or recommender systems, to match white hats' skills and organizations' requirements. Further investigation of white hat behavior through interviews or surveys [19] would be helpful.

### Stimulating Participation by Organizations

Our study provides incentives for organizations to join vulnerability discovery ecosystems and benefit from white hats' efforts. Government agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, also encourage organizations to have processes for receiving and addressing vulnerability reports [11], which can be achieved through bounty programs.

We contrast two participation models: the coercive model, represented by China-based platforms like Wooyun, where organizations are compelled to join once a white hat submits a vulnerability, and the voluntary model, represented by US-based platforms like HackerOne, where companies explicitly authorize external researchers to study their web systems. Both models have their advantages and disadvantages. The coercive model covers a wider range of organizations and may help find severe vulnerabilities in poorly secured websites, but it may face legal challenges in different countries. The voluntary model, while growing more slowly, likely encourages better response behavior to vulnerability reports. Future work is needed to identify and address organizations' concerns, including the perceived lack of trustworthiness of the white hat population [3], misuse of automated vulnerability scanners, and time wasted due to false reports [8].

## Conclusion

In this paper, we studied emerging web vulnerability discovery ecosystems, including white hats, organizations, and bug bounty platforms, based on publicly available data from Wooyun and HackerOne. Our quantitative analyses suggest that continuous collaboration with white hats, active efforts to enlarge the contributor base, and a well-designed recognition and reward structure are essential. We also propose future work directions to enhance the impact and coverage of these ecosystems.
