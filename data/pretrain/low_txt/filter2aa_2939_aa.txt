4. **Takeaways**

### Introduction: Active Directory
- **Main secrets storage of the domain**
- **Stores password hashes of all accounts**
- **In charge of authenticating accounts against domain resources**
- **Authentication protocols**
  - LDAP
  - NTLM
  - Kerberos
- **Common attacks**
  - Golden & Silver Ticket
  - Forged PAC
  - PTT (Pass-the-Ticket)
  - PTH (Pass-the-Hash)
  - NTLM Relay

### NTLM
- **Authentication is not bound to the session!**
  1. **NTLM Negotiate**
  2. **NTLM Challenge**
  3. **NTLM Authenticate**
  4. **NETLOGON**
  5. **Approve/Reject**

  **Client Machine** → **Server** → **DC**

### NTLM Relay
- **NTLM Relay Process**
  1. **NTLM Negotiate**
  2. **NTLM Challenge**
  3. **NTLM Authenticate**

  **Client Machine** → **Attacked Target** → **Server** → **DC**

### Mitigations for NTLM Relay
- **SMB Signing**
- **LDAP Signing**
- **EPA (Enhanced Protection for Authentication)**
- **LDAPS channel binding**
- **Server SPN target name validation**
- **Hardened UNC Paths**

#### SMB & LDAP Signing
- After authentication, all communication between client and server will be signed.
- The signing key is derived from the authenticating account’s password hash.
- The client calculates the session key by itself.
- The server receives the session key from the DC in the NETLOGON response.
- An attacker with relay capabilities has no way of retrieving the session key.

  **Client Machine** → **DC** → **Server** → **Attacked Target**
  - **Packet not signed correctly**
  - **+Session Key (Hash Derived)**

#### EPA (Enhanced Protection for Authentication)
- **RFC 5056**
- Binds the NTLM authentication to the secure channel over which the authentication occurs.
- The final NTLM authentication packet contains a hash of the target service’s certificate, signed with the user’s password hash.
- An attacker with relay capabilities uses a different certificate than the attacked target, hence the client responds with an incompatible certificate hash value.

  **(1) TLS Session**
  1. **NTLM Negotiate**
  2. **NTLM Challenge**
  3. **NTLM Authenticate**

  **Client Machine** → **DC** → **Server** → **Attacked Target**
  - **User signs the Server’s certificate**
  - **Incorrect certificate hash!**

### Known Vulnerabilities
- **LDAPS Relay (CVE-2017-8563)**
  - Discovered by Preempt in 2017
  - Group Policy Object (GPO) - “Domain Controller: LDAP server signing requirements”
  - Requires LDAP sessions to be signed OR encrypted via TLS (LDAPS)
  - TLS does not protect from credential forwarding!

- **CVE-2015-0005**
  - Discovered by Core Security (@agsolino)
  - DC didn’t verify target server identity
  - Allows NTLM Relay even when signing is required
  - **Fix**: Microsoft issued a fix in MS15-027
  - The fix validates that the computer which established the secure connection is the same as the target in the NTLM Authenticate request.

  **Client Machine** → **DC** → **Server** → **Attacked Target**
  - **Target hostname mismatch!**

### New Vulnerabilities
- **Your session key is my session key**
  - Retrieve the session key for any NTLM authentication
  - Bypasses the MS15-027 fix
  - **Original challenge vs. Modified challenge**
  - The client responds with an NTLM_AUTHENTICATE message with the target NetBIOS field missing
  - The NETLOGON message is sent without this field
  - The domain controller responds with a session key!

- **Drop the MIC**
  - Modify session requirements (such as signing)
  - Overcome the MIC protection

- **EPA bypass**
  - Relay authentication to servers which require EPA
  - Modify packets to bypass the EPA protection

- **Attacking AD-FS**
  - External lockout policy bypass

- **Reverse-Kerberoasting**
