### Path Mining in Web Processes Using Profiles

#### Introduction
The loan application data, as presented in Table 2, includes a model graph and a log of process instance executions. The data are lists of event records stored in a web-based system, which can be categorized into nominal attributes such as home-loan, education-loan, and car-loan. In this approach, the process log consists of process names, instance identifiers, web service names, variable names, and other relevant information. Table 3 shows the additional data stored in the web process log, including the values of web service variables and the paths followed during the execution of instances.

#### Profile Classification
Each profile triggers the execution of a specific set of web services. For each previously constructed profile, an additional attribute, the path attribute, is associated to indicate the path followed when the profile attributes are assigned specific values. This path attribute serves as the target class for classification.

Web process profiles provide input for machine learning and are characterized by six attributes: income, loan_type, loan_amount, loan_years, name, and SSN. The profiles for the loan process contain two types of attributes: numeric and nominal. The attributes income, loan_amount, loan_years, and SSN are numeric, while loan_type and name are nominal. For example, the nominal attribute loan_type can take the finite set of values: home-loan, education-loan, and car-loan. These attributes correspond to the web service input/output parameters stored in the web process log (Table 3).

Each profile is associated with a class indicating the path followed during the execution of a process. The last column of Table 3 shows the class named "path." The profiles and path attributes will be used to establish a relationship between the profiles and the paths followed at runtime. The profiles and the class "path" have been extracted from the web process log.

#### Path Mining Results
The path-mining technique developed has achieved encouraging results. When three or more attributes are involved in the prediction, the system can correctly predict the path followed for more than 75% of the process instances. This accuracy improves to over 82% when four attributes are involved. With five attributes, the prediction accuracy reaches 93.4%. Involving all six attributes in the prediction yields excellent results, with 88.9% of the paths correctly predicted. However, when only two attributes are selected, the prediction accuracy ranges from 25.9% to 86.7%.

#### Future Trends
Currently, organizations use Business Process Management Systems (BPMSs), such as Workflow Management Systems (WfMS), to define, enact, and manage a wide range of distinct applications, including insurance claims, bank loans, bioinformatic experiments, healthcare procedures, and telecommunication services. In the future, it is expected that a wider spectrum of applications will manage processes in organizations. According to the Aberdeen Group’s estimates, spending in the business process management software sector reached $2.26 billion in 2001.

The concept of path mining can be effectively used in many business applications, such as estimating the Quality of Service (QoS) of web processes and workflows. Organizations operating in modern markets, such as e-commerce and distributed web services interactions, require QoS management. Appropriate quality control leads to the creation of high-quality products and services, fulfilling customer expectations and achieving customer satisfaction.

#### Conclusion
BPMSs, web processes, workflows, and workflow systems represent fundamental technological infrastructures that efficiently define, manage, and support business processes. The data generated from the execution and management of web processes can be used to discover and extract knowledge about process executions and structure. Path mining is an important area of web processes, and it can be achieved using data-mining techniques, particularly classification, to extract path knowledge from web process logs. From the experiments, it is concluded that classification methods are a good solution for performing path mining on administrative and production web processes.
