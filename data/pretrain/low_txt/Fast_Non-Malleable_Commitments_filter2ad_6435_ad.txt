### Protocol Description

1. **Commitment Phase:**
   - For \(i = 1, \ldots, n\) and \(j = 1, \ldots, k\), where \(z_{i,j} = (r_{i,j}, m_j)\), the committer \(C\) sends commitments to every coordinate of \(z_{i,j}\) using a commitment scheme \(Com\).

2. **Challenge Phase:**
   - The receiver \(R\) sends random challenge vectors \(\{v_i\}_{i=1}^n\), where each \(v_i \in V_i \subset \mathbb{Z}_q^\ell\).

3. **Response Phase:**
   - The committer \(C\) sends evaluation vectors \(\{w_i\}\), where each \(w_i \in \mathbb{Z}_q^k\) is such that \(w_{i,j} = \langle z_{i,j}, v_i \rangle \in \mathbb{Z}_q\).

4. **Consistency Proof:**
   - The parties engage in a zero-knowledge argument protocol where \(C\) proves to \(R\) that there exist \(\{(m_{j,l}, s_{j,l})\}_{1 \leq j \leq k, 1 \leq l \leq \ell-1}\) and \(\{(r_{i,j}, s'_{i,j})\}_{1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq j \leq k}\) such that:
     - \(Com = \{Com_\sigma(m_{j,l}, s_{j,l})\}_{1 \leq j \leq k, 1 \leq l \leq \ell-1}\)
     - \(\{Com_\sigma(r_{i,j}, s'_{i,j})\}_{1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq j \leq k}\)
   - Additionally, it must hold that:
     - \(w_{i,j} = \langle z_{i,j}, v_i \rangle\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\) and \(1 \leq j \leq k\).

### Implementation Details

- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography:**
  - Our protocol is implemented over elliptic curves. Unlike [GRRV14], which required an exponential group size relative to the tag values (approximately 6000 bits for decent security), our protocol allows any secure group size, independent of the tag values. This flexibility enables the use of standard elliptic curve groups, such as NIST GF(P) elliptic curves.
  - We constructed our implementation using the MIRACL SDK, an open-source C software library for elliptic curve cryptography. Our implementation is generic and can be used with any EC parameters.

- **Performance:**
  - Table 3 presents performance measurements for our protocol. For example, committing to a message of size 24,576 bits with an El-Gamal modulus of 192 bits and tags of 32 bits takes approximately 4.5 giga clock cycles. On average, this translates to about 0.19 mega clock cycles per committed bit.

| Prime Size (log q) | Message Size (bits) | Clock Cycles (C+R) | IDs | Security (bits) |
|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----|-----------------|
| 192                | 12288               | 0.2 G + 1.15 G     | 2^16| 2^-96           |
| 192                | 24576               | 0.4 G + 4.1 G      | 2^32| 2^-96           |
| 192                | 49152               | 0.79 G + 15.3 G    | 2^64| 2^-96           |
| 224                | 12288               | 0.4 G + 2.46 G     | 2^16| 2^-112          |
| 224                | 24576               | 0.82 G + 8.7 G     | 2^32| 2^-112          |

- **Optimizations:**
  - We utilize precomputation techniques from [BGMW92] and batch verification from [LL94, BGR98] to improve the efficiency of the protocol.
  - The bucket test with small exponents and Comba multiplication [Com90] are also employed for further optimization.
