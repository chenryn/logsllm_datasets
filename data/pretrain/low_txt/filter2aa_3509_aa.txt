     - Last year was a great experience.
     - After our previous project, we wanted to try something new.
     - We aim to deepen our knowledge and experience in automotive security.
     - Our current car hacking experience is at 0%.

4. **Project Planning**
   - **Budget?**
   - **Where do we start?**
   - **Next Steps**
     - We already pwned an aftermarket IVI (In-Vehicle Infotainment System). What's next?
     - Let's go to the wrecking yard and look around.

5. **Wrecking Yard Experience**
   - **Funny Story**
     - A junkyard ≠ wrecking yard.
     - Looking for a late model OEM IVI.
     - "What do you have?"
       - An F150 that got into a brawl with a wall and lost.
       - A few more squashed cars that are too short.
       - One almost perfect car.
     - We ended up selecting a car by happenstance, totally random.

6. **Dashboard Extraction**
   - **GIMME THAT DASHBOARD!**
   - **One Week Later: Carception**

7. **Setup and Initial Testing**
   - **A Trip to Lowe’s and a Few Hours Later**
   - **Initial Assembly**
     - Once fully assembled, it kinda works.
     - A "few" errors appear on the instrument panels.
     - We need to get this thing on the table somewhat functional.

9. **Ownership Transfer**
   - **Next Step: Switch Owners in the Backend**
   - **Nissan Requires Proof of Ownership**
   - **Wrecking Yard Interaction**
     - Go ask nicely for the title from the wrecking yard... No.
     - Wrecking guy reaction: Junk title can’t be moved.
     - Bill of sale, wrecking yard receipt?
     - Ask Nissan nicely and you shall receive.

10. **IVI Attack Surface**
    - **We Already Pwned One in the Past**
    - **IVI Running Windows Automotive 7**
      - No source code available, requires license.
      - Too boring, we want to hack this but...
      - Maybe there is something else to hack, let's keep looking.

      - WHOIS lookup
      - Bought the domain for the lulz!
      - Set up an EC2 instance and ran a generic honey pot.
      - First knock comes from Japan.
      - More knocks on the door, not your usual automated tools.
