#### RA-9: Criticality Analysis
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
- Enterprises should conduct a criticality analysis as a prerequisite for assessing cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) activities.
- The criticality analysis should be performed during the Frame step of the C-SCRM Risk Management Process.
- Findings from the Assess step, such as threat analysis, vulnerability analysis, and mitigation strategies, should update and tailor the criticality analysis.
- A symbiotic relationship exists between the criticality analysis and other Assess step activities, enhancing each other.
- For a high-quality criticality analysis, enterprises should iteratively apply it throughout the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and concurrently across all three levels.
- Prime contractors and sub-tier contractors should be required to implement this control.
- Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F for additional guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, "Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity."

#### RA-10: Threat Hunting
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
- C-SCRM threat hunting activities should complement the enterprise’s internal threat hunting efforts.
- As a crucial part of the C-SCRM process, enterprises should actively monitor for threats to their supply chain.
- Collaboration between C-SCRM and other cyber defense functions within the enterprise is essential.
- Threat hunting capabilities can be provided through shared services, especially when an enterprise lacks the resources to perform these activities independently.
- Typical activities include information sharing with peer enterprises and consuming threat intelligence sources, such as those from Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs).
- These activities help identify and flag indicators of increased cybersecurity risks, such as cyber incidents, mergers and acquisitions, and Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI).
- Intelligence gathered enables proactive identification and response to threats emanating from the supply chain.

#### Family: System and Services Acquisition
**FIPS 200** specifies the minimum security requirements for System and Services Acquisition:
- Allocate sufficient resources to protect organizational information systems.
- Employ system development life cycle (SDLC) processes that incorporate information security considerations.
- Implement software usage and installation restrictions.
- Ensure third-party providers employ adequate security measures to protect outsourced information, applications, and services.

**Acquisition of ICT/OT Products and Services:**
- Enterprises acquire ICT/OT products and services through system and services acquisition.
- Controls address the activities of acquirers, suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and related upstream supply chain relationships.
- Both physical and logical aspects of supply chain security are covered, from detection to SDLC and security engineering principles.
- C-SCRM concerns are prominently addressed in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5, with further detail and refinement provided in this document.

#### SA-1: Policy and Procedures
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
- The system and services acquisition policy and procedures should address C-SCRM throughout the acquisition management life cycle, including purchases made via charge cards.
- C-SCRM procurement actions and contracts should include requirements, implementation specifications, and verification methods.
- C-SCRM should be included as an evaluation factor in applicable procurements.
- C-SCRM considerations should be applied to all procurements, not just those directly related to ICT/OT products or services.
- Policies and procedures should address supply chain risks that may arise during contract performance, such as changes in ownership or actionable information indicating a supply chain threat.
- Enterprises should monitor public announcements and supplier communications to stay informed about changes in the supply chain.

**Level(s):** 1, 2, 3

#### SA-2: Allocation of Resources
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
- The enterprise should incorporate C-SCRM requirements when determining and establishing the allocation of resources.

**Level(s):** 1, 2

---

#### SA-3: System Development Life Cycle
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
- There is a strong relationship between the SDLC and C-SCRM activities.
- Enterprises should ensure that C-SCRM activities are integrated into the SDLC for both the enterprise and its suppliers, developers, system integrators, and service providers.
- In addition to traditional SDLC activities, the SDLC includes inventory management, acquisition and procurement, and the logical delivery of systems and components.
- See Section 2 and Appendix C for further guidance on SDLC. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, "Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity."

**Level(s):** 1, 2, 3

#### SA-4: Acquisition Process
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
- Enterprises should include C-SCRM requirements, descriptions, and criteria in contractual agreements.
- Establish baseline and tailorable C-SCRM requirements for procurement, addressing regulatory mandates, critical elements, intellectual property, product lifespan, and secondary market components.
- Develop plans for acquiring spare parts and alternative sources of supply.
- Work with suppliers to define incident response and information-sharing processes.
- Establish and maintain verification procedures and acceptance criteria for delivered products and services.
- Ensure continuous monitoring plans include supply chain aspects and monitor supplier information systems.
- Communicate processes for reporting information security weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
- Review and confirm sustained compliance with the terms and conditions of the agreement.

**Level(s):** 1, 2, 3

#### SA-5: System Documentation
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
- Information system documentation should include relevant C-SCRM concerns.
- Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, "Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity."

**Level(s):** 3

#### SA-8: Security and Privacy Engineering Principles
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
- Anticipate potential misuse or abuse of ICT/OT products or services and address intended and unintended use scenarios in architecture and design.
- Design network and security architectures based on the enterprise’s risk tolerance.
- Document and gain management approval for unmitigated risks.
- Limit the number, size, and privilege levels of critical elements using criticality analysis.
- Use security mechanisms to reduce opportunities for exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities.
- Design information system components to be difficult to disable and trigger notification methods if disabled.
- Design delivery mechanisms to avoid unnecessary exposure or access during delivery.
- Design validation mechanisms for use during implementation and operation.

#### SA-11: Developer Testing and Evaluation
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
- Depending on the origins of components, testing may be implemented differently.
- For off-the-shelf (OTS) components, the acquirer should research or request proof of testing by the OEM.
- When the acquirer has control over the application and development processes, they should require testing as part of the SDLC.
- Examples of C-SCRM-relevant testing include testing for counterfeits, verifying component origins, examining configuration settings, and testing interfaces.
- Prioritize testing based on criticality, threat, and vulnerability analyses, and the effectiveness of testing techniques.
- Third-party testing may also be required as part of developer security testing.
- Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, "Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity."
