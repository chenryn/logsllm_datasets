### Mitigating Attacks and Enhancing Security

- **Expired Keys and Listed Destinations:** Ensuring that keys are regularly updated and destinations are carefully managed can help mitigate certain types of attacks. Additionally, imposing a deadline on the transmission at each hop may further enhance security [11].
- **Forgery Prevention:** Signatures on capability blocks prevent unauthorized parties from forging these blocks and submitting them to directory servers.
- **Mix Network Integrity:** To protect against flooding the directories with non-functional mix entries, running highly reliable mixes can help in gaining traffic for analysis. However, this also poses a risk as it may encourage users to use dishonest mixes. Availability and reliability statistics can help mitigate some of these issues, but they introduce new challenges. This area remains an active field of research [11, 12].

### Future Directions and Open Problems

This design document represents the first step in the peer review of the Type III remailer protocol. Several aspects, from core design to peripheral choices, require further attention:

- **Batching Strategies:** More research is needed on batching strategies that resist blending and intersection attacks [36, 6]. The anonymity provided during normal operation and under attack must be balanced with other properties such as latency and reliability.
- **Multiple-Message Tagging Attacks:** A thorough investigation of multiple-message tagging attacks is necessary, along with an analysis of how to safely choose paths when sending many messages. For messages larger than the Mixminion payload size, a strategy for fragmentation is required.
- **Forward Messages and Replies:** Simplifying the design to maintain the indistinguishability of forward messages and replies is a goal. We need to prove that our design provides bit-wise unlinkability between the input bit-patterns of messages and the output messages.
- **Distinguishing Reply Messages:** Currently, reply messages can be distinguished from plaintext forward messages at the exit nodes. Encrypted forward messages are arranged to blend in with reply messages, but this still allows for some degree of distinguishability. Further methods to mitigate this problem would be beneficial.
- **Synchronous Batching:** A synchronous batching approach, where messages have deadlines for each hop, may allow for easier anonymity analysis and provide larger anonymity sets. While this approach offers better protection against message delaying and partitioning attacks, it also introduces greater network synchronization and overhead, and reduces mix operator flexibility.
- **Dummy Messages:** Stronger intuition and analytical justification are needed for the use of dummy messages. These messages can serve as link padding or as actual multi-hop Mixminion messages. Determining which parties send dummy messages, how many, and when, requires a more rigorous approach. Despite speculation about their benefits, we plan to leave dummies out of the design until their effects on anonymity are better understood.

### Implementation and Performance

We have developed working code that implements most of the designs described in this paper, achieving acceptable performance even with 2048-bit RSA keys (800KB of messages per second on a 1GHz Athlon). We invite interested developers to join the mixminion-dev mailing list and review the more detailed Mixminion specification [24].

### Acknowledgments

This paper incorporates ideas from the Mixmaster development team, including Len Sassaman, Scott Renfro, Peter Palfrader, Ulf Möller, Lance Cottrell, and Bram Cohen, who aimed to improve the Type II remailer protocol. Their effort was later redirected to Mixminion.

We thank Susan Born, Lucky Green, David Hopwood, David Mazières, Peter Palfrader, Len Sassaman, Andrei Serjantov, Robyn Wagner, and Bryce “Zooko” Wilcox-O’Hearn for their valuable design discussions, editing, and suggestions. We also extend our gratitude to all the unnamed cypherpunks who have contributed to remailer issues over the past decades.
