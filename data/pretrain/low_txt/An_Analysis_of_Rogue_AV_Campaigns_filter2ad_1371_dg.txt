### Uniquely Identifying Users Across Social Networks

In this paper, we continue to explore the vulnerabilities in social networking sites and demonstrate that an attacker can automatically cross-correlate information between different platforms. This process can reveal a person's multiple online identities, sometimes uncovering "secret" profiles.

### 7. Conclusion

In this study, we presented a novel attack that exploits a common weakness present in many popular social networking sites. We conducted real-world experiments on eight distinct social networks, each with millions of users. Our approach leverages the fact that attackers can query social network providers for registered email addresses on a large scale. Starting with a list of approximately 10.4 million email addresses, we were able to automatically identify over 1.2 million user profiles associated with these addresses.

We then automatically crawled these user profiles to collect personal information. By iterating through the extracted friend lists, we generated additional candidate email addresses, which were used to discover new profiles. The significance of our attack lies in its ability to correlate information about users across multiple social networks. Users who register on multiple platforms using the same email address are particularly vulnerable. Our experiments show that we can automatically extract information that users may wish to keep hidden, such as identifying individuals who use different names on dating websites or claim to be younger than they actually are. The automatic correlation of this information has significant privacy implications.

After verifying the feasibility of our attack, we contacted major social network providers, including Facebook, MySpace, XING, and Twitter. These companies acknowledged the threat and informed us that they would implement some of our suggested countermeasures. As of now, Facebook and XING have addressed the issue by limiting the number of requests a single source can perform, and we expect other social networks to follow suit.

**Abstract:**
Rogue antivirus software has recently received extensive attention due to its widespread distribution and effectiveness. This paper presents a longitudinal analysis of the rogue antivirus threat ecosystem, focusing on its structure, dynamics, and economics. We compiled and analyzed a large dataset of characteristics of rogue antivirus domains and the servers hosting them. Our contributions include:
1. The first broad analysis, to our knowledge, of the infrastructure supporting the distribution of rogue security software, tracking 6,500 malicious domains.
2. The application of attack attribution methodologies to correlate campaigns likely associated with the same individuals or groups, identifying 127 rogue security software campaigns comprising 4,549 domains.
3. A comparison of our findings with a different threat ecosystem, that of browser exploits, highlighting the structural differences and their economic root causes.

**Introduction:**
Rogue security software, often referred to as "rogue AV," pretends to be legitimate security software but provides little or no protection. In some cases, it facilitates the installation of malicious code. Rogue AVs typically reach victim machines through social engineering or by exploiting vulnerabilities in client software to install without user intervention. Once installed, rogue AVs use various techniques to convince or force users to pay for additional tools or services, costing $30–$100.

Over a one-year period, Symantec detected 43 million installation attempts covering over 250 distinct families of rogue AV software. Affiliate programs alone can generate up to $300,000 per month for distributors. While previous studies have focused on individual facets of the rogue AV problem, this work aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the organization and dynamics of rogue AV campaigns, focusing on the infrastructure and strategies used.

**State of the Art:**
The presence of rogue security software has been observed since at least 2005. Previous reports have ranged from diffusion analyses to social and economic studies. Recent industry reports have provided detailed descriptions of rogue software, but little has been done to understand the overall ecosystem. This work complements existing research by offering new insights into the structure and peculiarities of the rogue AV threat.

**Methodology:**
Our methodology involves three phases:
1. **Data Collection:** We aggregated domain names from various sources, including Norton Safeweb, Malware Domain List, Malware URL, and Hosts File. We also used IP-NAME mapping datasets to discover all domain names hosted on IPs where at least one rogue domain was found.
2. **Server Information:** We collected detailed information on each domain, including web server details and dynamics, using the Historical ARchive of Malicious URLs (HARMUR).
3. **Campaign Attribution:** We applied a multi-criteria fusion algorithm to group domains into campaigns based on common features, using unsupervised, graph-based clustering and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA).

**Conclusion:**
This work provides a large-scale analysis of the rogue AV threat and its distribution infrastructure, demonstrating the usefulness of attack attribution approaches. We characterized the behavior and economics of rogue AV campaigns, revealing insights into the automated deployment of large numbers of domains and the specific economic balance justifying such large-scale campaigns. We also compared our findings with other web-based threats, providing a more complete picture of the underground economy and its dynamics.
