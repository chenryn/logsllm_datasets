## Biography
Gene Tsudik is a Chancellor's Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). He earned his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Southern California (USC) in 1991. Prior to joining UCI in 2000, he worked at the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory (1991-1996) and the USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI) (1996-2000). His research interests have spanned various topics in security and applied cryptography.

Dr. Tsudik is a Fulbright Scholar, a Fulbright Specialist, and a fellow of the ACM, IEEE, and AAAS. He is also a member of Academia Europaea. From 2009 to 2015, he served as the Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Information and Systems Security (TISSEC).

## Abstract
Genomic privacy has garnered significant attention from the research community, primarily due to the unique risks and the potential for breaches that can lead to the exposure of highly personal and sensitive information. In contrast, the less explored topic of genomic security aims to mitigate the threats of a digitized genome being altered by its owner or an external party. Such alterations can have severe consequences, particularly in medical and legal contexts. Additionally, many anticipated genomic applications, which vary in their trust requirements, often need only small amounts of genomic data. Supporting these applications necessitates a careful balance between security and privacy. The large size of the genome also raises performance concerns.

We argue that genomic security must be taken seriously and studied as a distinct research area. To this end, we outline the problem space, identify the stakeholders, discuss assumptions about them, and propose several straightforward approaches based on common cryptographic techniques, including signature variants and authenticated data structures. We also present some extensions and highlight opportunities for future research. The primary goal of this paper is to underscore the importance of genomic security as a standalone research topic.
