### Governance, Standard Operating Procedures, and Usage: Established Implementation

#### Boston Urban Area (UA)
The Boston Urban Area, also known as the Metro Boston Homeland Security Region (MBHSR), encompasses nine jurisdictions: the cities of Boston, Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, Quincy, Revere, and Somerville; and the towns of Brookline and Winthrop.

**Governance:**
- The Boston UA is managed by nine Jurisdictional Points of Contact who provide guidance to the Communications Interoperability Subcommittee (CIS).
- Partnerships among member agencies are established through a combination of formal and informal agreements, such as memoranda of understanding.
- The Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) Peer Review noted the strength of long-term interoperability in the planning process.
- Year-to-year grant funds support most regional communications priorities, but the Boston UA lacks long-term funding strategies for addressing lifecycle costs.
- Key leaders, including those from MBHSR and the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety, support communications interoperability efforts.

**Recommendations:**
- Expand CIS membership to include public support disciplines, state, and federal agencies (e.g., hospitals, public health).
- Develop and implement a regional approach to long-term (3-5 years) interoperability planning and sustainable funding, and explore regional funding alternatives.
- Broaden and champion a governance structure that fully supports regional communications interoperability.
- Involve senior government leadership in interoperability and encourage long-term regional funding plans.
- Align local and state strategic planning efforts to meet regional interoperability needs.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOP):**
- The Boston UA integrated existing SOPs into the TICP, including procedures for the Boston Area Police Emergency Radio Network system and MetroFire.
- The TICP expands these policies to support multijurisdictional, multidiscipline communications interoperability.
- The TICP Peer Review noted comprehensive cooperation and collaboration among regional agencies.
- The UA is disseminating these procedures through TICP training to address gaps identified during the validation exercise, particularly for emergency medical services (EMS).
- Boston officials are implementing the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS), with ongoing training to address identified gaps.

**Recommendations:**
- Document and distribute regional interoperability SOPs and put them into practice through regular training, exercises, and usage.
- Identify and document the title and source of existing SOPs in the TICP.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage:**
- The Boston UA uses shared systems and gateways, including console patches, on a daily basis.
- The use of a common channel plan was noted as a best practice.
- The TICP validation exercise demonstrated successful use of interoperable equipment, with some difficulty reported by EMS.
- EMS capabilities for interoperable communications are a priority to address.

**Recommendations:**
- Consider adding interoperability as a component for all future exercises and day-to-day activities, as appropriate.
- Include additional local, state, and federal agencies (e.g., public health) in future exercises and day-to-day use.

**Technology Overview:**
- Interoperability is achieved through the exchange of radios, sharing of channels, gateway solutions, and shared systems.
- Five radio caches are available, containing VHF, UHF, and 800 MHz radios.
- A regional subscriber unit channel plan is in place, with radios programmed with a common set of shared channels.
- Six mobile gateway devices are available, owned by various agencies.
- The MBHSR has a 5-year strategic plan to improve communications interoperability, with a goal to migrate all shared systems to the UHF frequency band.

### Detroit, MI
#### Detroit Urban Area (UA)
The Detroit Urban Area includes the City of Detroit and the counties of Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne.

**Governance:**
- The Southeast Michigan Regional Interoperability Communications Committee was recently established to address specific communications interoperability issues.
- The group was formalized in October 2006 and began regularly meeting in November 2006.
- The UA prioritizes interoperable communications, with formal partnerships among organizations but lacks formal, documented interoperability agreements outside the TICP.
- Funding for interoperable communications is a high priority, but the majority of funding is based on federal grants, not addressing recurring costs.
- High-level leadership involvement is needed to provide continued fiscal and political support for interoperable communications.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue regular meetings, include all relevant agencies, and define roles and responsibilities.
- Document and formalize necessary agreements, including local, state, and federal partnerships.
- Develop a strategic plan with long-term interoperability goals, aligning local and state strategic planning efforts.
- Initiate a regional approach to long-term (3-5 years) interoperability planning and sustainable funding.
- Consider the direct involvement of a high-level official to advocate for and focus on communications interoperability issues.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOP):**
- The Detroit UA incorporated several pre-existing individual county SOPs into the regional TICP.
- The TICP attempted to develop more comprehensive policies, but the TICP Peer Review recommended consolidating regional procedures.
- The newly created regional SOPs have not been distributed to all public safety agencies, though they participated in a TICP Workshop.
- The Detroit UA is in the early stages of implementing NIMS/ICS policies and procedures.

**Recommendations:**
- Review and update SOPs to ensure consistency with regional and statewide interoperability planning.
- Develop, disseminate, and train on regional communications interoperability SOPs.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage:**
- Agencies within the Detroit UA achieve adequate communications interoperability through existing solutions.
- Although interoperable communications equipment resources are used infrequently, the TICP validation exercise noted users' knowledge and skills.
- The UA encountered problems using gateways, suggesting the need for regular training and exercises.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources to improve proficiency.
- Involve additional local, state, and federal agencies in training and exercises.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

**Technology Overview:**
- The Detroit UA operates multiple VHF, UHF, and 800 MHz radio systems in analog and digital modes.
- Interoperability is achieved through cached radios, mobile and fixed gateways, and shared channels, including those provided by the National Public Safety Policy Advisory Committee (NPSPAC) and the Michigan Public Safety Communication System (MPSCS).
