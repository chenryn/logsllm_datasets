#### Origins and Early Days
- **Late 2002**: Ideas for creating Defcon Groups began to take shape.
- **Early 2003**: One of a dozen or so individuals started a group, with the vision that it would be even more awesome than the local 2600 meetings.
- **Official Launch**: Defcon Groups officially launched at Defcon 11 in 2003.

#### Local Experiences
- **DC207**: The reality of starting a local group. Initially, there were highs and lows, but eventually, everyone got busy.
- **DC503**: Moved to Oregon and participated in the vibrant 503 scene.
- **DC206**: Relocated to Seattle and found a thriving hacker community.

#### Challenges and Evolution
- **Over the Years**: Many active groups went their own way, some considering abandoning the Defcon banner in favor of hackerspaces, which often had cooler names.
- **Group Status**: 
  - Started with over 170+ groups internationally.
  - 102 were inactive.
  - 30 had significantly changed, with many POCs (Points of Contact) no longer involved.

#### Current State and Future
- **DCG Lives!**: 
  - 91 active Defcon Groups worldwide and growing.
  - Several new groups are in the process of starting up.
- **What's Coming?**:
