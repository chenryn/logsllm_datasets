### Potential Risks and Mitigations in User Authentication

Authentication protocols such as Google AuthSub, AOL OpenAuth, and Yahoo BBAuth may lead users to become accustomed to being redirected to identity provider websites for authentication. If users do not verify the authenticity of these websites before entering their credentials—and studies indicate that they often do not—phishing attacks become a significant risk. To mitigate this, users must confirm the authenticity of an identity provider before entering their credentials. Current research on authenticating websites to users includes the use of security indicators, secure bookmarks for known websites, and automated detection and blacklisting of known phishing sites. However, studies suggest that security indicators are ineffective at preventing phishing attacks, and blacklisting known phishing sites still suffers from high rates of false-positives and false-negatives. Even with improved security indicators, users tend to ignore them. Enhancing the resilience of the OpenID protocol against phishing attacks is a critical area for future work.

### Performance Evaluation of OpenPolicy

To evaluate the performance characteristics of containment queries in OpenPolicy, we created a set of credentials for each OpenPolicy server and then triggered a worst-case containment query (i.e., A.r ⊆ D, but D is not a member of A.r), which required enumerating all credential statements on all testing servers. The results are shown in Figure 5. For each run, a different number of credential statements (ranging from 5,000 to 25,000) were generated on each server, and a varying number of threads (from five to twenty) were invoked to simulate concurrent authorization requests.

To improve authorization response times, OpenPolicy caches proof graphs. When proof graphs are cached, the response time becomes linear with the number of servers involved in the query process. In our testbed, the worst-case response time was less than 3 milliseconds when caching was used. Proof graph caches significantly enhance the response time of OpenPolicy. However, when the size of the cached graphs exceeds available memory, cache efficiency begins to degrade. Future work will explore other cache strategies to improve cache efficiency. We also plan to apply authorization recycling techniques to derive access-control decisions directly on Content Service Providers (CSPs) based on cached authorization responses from OpenPolicy providers.

### Conclusion

Since the inception of the Web, "identity wars" have led service providers to build "walls" to protect their customer base. These "walls," however, restrict the evolution of the Web. In this paper, we described the design, architecture, and implementation of a system for secure content sharing beyond walled gardens. Future work includes conducting usability studies on our prototype to ensure the proposed mechanisms are user-friendly. For phishing prevention, we aim to explore the feasibility of OpenID functioning without relying on redirection between CSPs and OpenID identity providers. Additionally, we plan to investigate other cache strategies and apply authorization recycling techniques on CSPs to improve authorization response times.

Our approach promotes user-centric access control. In our vision of a truly user-centric Web 2.0, users own their personal content and can share it freely across and beyond walled gardens. Users also have the freedom to choose their preferred providers for identities, content, social relationships, and access-control policies. This separation of personal content and services allows service providers to focus on delivering valuable services, no longer requiring users to compromise their identity or expand their social networks unnecessarily to share content.

### Implementation and Evaluation

To evaluate our implemented approach, we developed an OpenID email provider and an OpenPolicy provider using J2EE. We reused OpenID4Java, an open-source Java library, to support OpenID protocols for implementing identity providers and consumer (relying party) websites. OpenPolicy uses Apache Tomcat as a web container and stores credential statements in a MySQL database. To validate the design of our prototype, we developed a Facebook application that enables Facebook users to share their private photo albums with non-Facebook users via our proposed sharing architecture.

In addition to validating the correctness of data flows and inference logic, the runtime latency during authorization decision processes was a key concern. To evaluate the performance of OpenPolicy, we deployed it on three hosts within our institution's internal network, each with different hardware and operating systems to ensure portability and unbiased performance measurements. The configurations included: (A) Intel Duo Core 2 2.4GHz CPU, 4GB RAM, running Windows Vista; (B) Intel Duo Core 2 2.6GHz CPU, 4GB RAM, running MacOS 10.5.6; and (C) AMD Opteron Processor 142 CPU, 8GB RAM, running Linux 2.4.27. The testing machines were connected over a local area network with 100Mbps Ethernet adapters, resulting in an average round-trip latency of less than 0.1 millisecond.
