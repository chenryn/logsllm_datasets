### Strategic Planning Efforts

- **No Plan/Plan Under Development:** 58%
- **Plan Developed but not yet Adopted:** 18%
- **Plan Developed and Adopted:** 24%

### Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards
**Urban/Metropolitan Area: 11**
**Date: January 2007**

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Findings

Evaluating the level of SOP maturity required attention to two key areas:
1. **Communications Policies, Practices, and Procedures**
2. **Command and Control**

**SOP Finding 1:**
- The TICP provided the first region-wide equipment SOP for many areas.
- Through the development of the DHS-required TICP, virtually every urban/metropolitan area has instituted a consensus, regional process for the request, activation, and use of interoperable communications equipment.
- Prior to the TICP, the most common multi-agency equipment SOPs were primarily intended for users of shared systems. Some areas also cited gateway SOPs developed under previous federal efforts such as the Department of Justice’s “25 Cities” project.
- Relatively few state and federal responder agencies are covered by these SOPs, indicating a need for greater participation in the development and implementation of procedures.

**SOP Finding 2:**
- The majority of areas have taken steps to disseminate their equipment SOPs throughout the region.
- Dissemination methods include distribution to dispatch centers, storing applicable SOPs with gateways and radio caches, and developing training courses on SOPs for included agencies.
- The TICP validation exercise was a major stimulus for SOP training, with more than half of the urban/metropolitan areas participating in ICTAP “Tactical Plan Implementation Workshops.”
- However, the short period between TICP completion and the exercise deadline made it difficult to fully circulate new SOPs at the “line” responder level. Only one-third of the areas were fully successful in following their prescribed equipment SOPs.

**SOP Maturity Levels:**
- **Early:** 0
- **Intermediate:** 5
- **Established:** 10
- **Advanced:** 15

**What it Means:**
- **Policies and Procedures:** Exist to support interoperable communications during incident response.
- **Command and Control (NIMS/ICS):** Used to effectively coordinate incident communications.

**SOP Finding 3:**
- Ninety-seven percent of urban/metropolitan areas report that they are in the process of implementing NIMS; however, less than half have had these command and control policies in place for more than one year.
- Two out of three urban/metropolitan areas achieved “Intermediate” maturity in the implementation of NIMS/ICS command and control procedures.
- Exercise findings indicate that NIMS proficiency varies by responder discipline, with fire agencies showing more aptitude.

**SOP Finding 4:**
- A NIMS Certified Communications Unit Leader (COML) Course is needed to improve proficiency in fulfilling the COML responsibilities during incident response.
- Although DHS provided core competencies and ICTAP developed an overview course on COML duties, formal training and a certification program are not yet available.
- Only 16 percent of the areas were able to implement the COML position without difficulties during the exercises. Successful areas were predominantly urban, possibly due to dedicated UASI funds for personnel to participate in the National Wildland Fire’s discipline-specific training course for COML.

**Example of Highest and Lowest SOP Maturity for an Urban Area:**
- **Advanced Implementation:**
  - 10 urban/metropolitan areas received “advanced implementation” in SOPs.
  - SOPs have been in place for many years and were regionally developed.
  - SOPs were enhanced/updated through TICP, including extensive inventory.
  - NIMS has been in place for more than one year.
  - Policies were effectively followed during the exercise.

- **Intermediate Implementation:**
  - All urban/metropolitan areas received at least “intermediate implementation” in SOPs (14 areas received “intermediate implementation”).
  - SOPs were largely informal prior to the TICP.
  - The TICP is a compilation of agency policies rather than a single consensus SOP.
  - Few steps have been taken to implement/train on new SOPs.
  - NIMS is still being implemented and was problematic during the exercise.

**NIMS/ICS Implementation:**
- **In Process:** 10%
- **More than 6 months ago:** 15%
- **More than 1 year ago:** 29%

### Usage Findings

**Usage Finding 1:**
- Sixty-eight percent of urban/metropolitan areas effectively established regional interoperability.
- While all evaluated areas could use some level of multi-agency interoperability, multijurisdictional communications necessary for tactical response were successfully demonstrated by more than 60 percent of the areas.
- One-half (21 percent overall) demonstrated seamless use of all types of interoperability equipment, providing communications for regional, state, and federal personnel.
- Remaining successful areas encountered problems with at least one type of equipment but achieved interoperability through backup measures or rapid problem resolution.
- In some cases, the limited scope of the TICP validation exercise prevented the demonstration of seamless interoperable communications capabilities.

**Usage Finding 2:**
- More than 80 percent of urban/metropolitan areas use shared systems and/or shared channels daily to provide communications interoperability.
- Multi-agency interoperability occurs using talk groups on trunked systems and/or conventional shared channels.
- This method was successfully used in almost every TICP validation exercise.
- Common issues included radio channel configuration and nomenclature.

**Usage Finding 3:**
- The most common equipment usage problems during the TICP validation exercises related to mobile gateways.
- Gateway devices were the most common method to connect responders on disparate systems.
- When mobile gateways were deployed, responders often encountered technical familiarity issues, consistent with the varying frequency of gateway use across areas.

**Usage Finding 4:**
- Urban/metropolitan areas can build on the success of their TICP validation exercise by expanding future training scenarios to focus on communications capabilities.
- For many areas, the TICP validation exercise was the first time they participated in a test designed specifically for communications.
- The aggressive timeline led some areas to minimize the scope of their exercises, which, while sufficient to demonstrate interoperability, did not test critical aspects of a real-world response (e.g., system loading).

**Example of Highest and Lowest Usage Maturity for an Urban Area:**
- **Advanced Implementation:**
  - 10 urban areas received “advanced implementation” in usage.
  - Interoperability across disparate systems is achieved daily.
  - The use of regional equipment by local, state, and federal agencies in the TICP validation exercise was described as “exemplary.”

- **Intermediate Implementation:**
  - All urban areas received at least “intermediate implementation” in usage (13 areas received “intermediate implementation”).
  - Exercise demonstrated that “some participants have not had sufficient practice in the use of the equipment.”
  - Limited local involvement in the exercise.
  - State and federal agencies were not involved in the exercise.

**Usage Maturity Levels:**
- **Early:** 0
- **Intermediate:** 5
- **Established:** 10
- **Advanced:** 15

**What it Means:**
- **Response Agencies:** How well they can use existing interoperable equipment in multi-jurisdictional responses.
- **Interoperable Equipment Usage:** How regularly it is used.

### Next Steps for FY 2007

DHS will continue to align its programs and resources to address the communications needs of first responders. This will require a coordinated effort to provide increased resources and assistance to states and localities to empower greater communications interoperability across broader regions. Focus on five priority efforts will support this goal:

1. **FY 2007 Grant Programs:**
   - The FY 2007 Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) and Infrastructure Protection Program will encourage interoperable communications as a program focus area.

2. **Completed Communications Unit Leader (COML) Training:**
   - DHS will complete and release the criteria for COML training to ensure public safety agencies have clearer guidance on the COML role in incident response.

3. **Improvement Plans/Scorecard Recommendations:**
   - DHS ICTAP will develop and deliver technical assistance to address the most prevalent gaps identified through the Tactical Interoperable Communications exercises.

4. **Best Practices/Lessons Learned:**
   - A compendium of all best practices and lessons learned from the TICP validation exercises will be provided to each urban/metropolitan area.
