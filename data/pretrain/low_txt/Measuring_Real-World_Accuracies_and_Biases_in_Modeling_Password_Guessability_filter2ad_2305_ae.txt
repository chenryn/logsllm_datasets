### Appendix

#### A.1 Alternate PCFG Configurations

We tested four different PCFG configurations to support the ecological validity of our study. These configurations include:

- **PCFG**: Komanduri's implementation of PCFG [32], which assigns letter strings probabilities based on their frequency in the training data and assigns unseen strings a non-zero probability. For consistency, we prepend all policy-compliant elements of the training data.
- **PCFG−noCV**: Same as PCFG but without prepending the training data.
- **PCFG−CV**: Equivalent to PCFG−noCV but uses two-fold cross-validation. In each fold, half of the test passwords are used as additional training data, with a total weighting equal to the generic training data, as recommended by Kelley et al. [31].
- **PCFG−2009**: Our approximation of the original 2009 Weir et al. algorithm [70], where alphabetic strings are assigned uniform probability and unseen terminals have a probability of zero.

As shown in Figure 15, prepending the training data and performing cross-validation generally result in more efficient guessing, particularly for long and long-basic passwords. All three other configurations outperform the original PCFG−2009 implementation.

Figure 16 shows the guessability of the 350 passwords composed only of digits across the Basic and LongBasic sets. Similar to the results for passwords with other common characteristics (Section 4.3.2), approaches differ. Notably, PCFG−2009 plateaus at around 50% of such passwords guessed in fewer than 10 million guesses, and it would never guess another password of this type due to its probability assignment method.

#### A.2 Alternate JTR Configurations

We separately analyzed the sets of JTR mangling rules combined in the body of the paper:

- **JTR stock**: 23 default rules that come with JTR.
- **JTR SpiderLabs**: 5,146 rules published by KoreLogic during the 2010 DEF CON "Crack Me If You Can" password-cracking contest [35], later reordered for guessing efficiency by Trustwave Spiderlabs [64].

As described in Section 3.3, our standard JTR configuration used JTR stock followed by JTR SpiderLabs. In isolation (Figure 17), JTR stock rules were far more efficient on a guess-by-guess basis than JTR SpiderLabs. However, they quickly ran out of guesses. We exhausted JTR stock in making fewer than 10^9 guesses for Basic passwords and fewer than 10^5 guesses for valid Complex passwords. Thus, any analysis using only the stock rules will vastly underestimate the guessability of passwords with many different character classes.

The sharp jumps in the proportion of Complex and LongComplex passwords guessed by JTR SpiderLabs result from one group of 13 rules. These rules capitalize the first letter, append digits, append special characters, and append both digits and special characters.

#### A.3 Alternate Hashcat Configurations

We tested eight Hashcat configurations and chose the one that performed best.
