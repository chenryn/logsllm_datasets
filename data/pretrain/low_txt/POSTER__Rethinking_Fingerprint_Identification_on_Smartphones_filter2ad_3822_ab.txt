### Conductive Printing and SCRAP Image Reconstruction

In our experiment, we utilized Cao et al.’s conductive printing method to reconstruct the SCRAP image. The forgery process is as follows:

1. **SCRAP Image Reconstruction**: We followed the procedure of the SCRAP attack, as summarized in Section 2, to prepare a reconstructed SCRAP image (e.g., Figure 2-(a)).

2. **Image Preparation for Conductive Printing**:
   - **Horizontal Flip and Color Inversion**: We flipped the SCRAP image horizontally and reversed its black/white color to ensure it can be directly submitted to a touch sensor.
   - **Image Enhancement**: Before printing, we enhanced the reversed image using the SourceAFIS library [9] to improve its quality.

3. **Printing Process**: We printed the enhanced image using AgIC conductive ink and AgIC special paper. Figures 2-(a) to (c) illustrate an example of the SCRAP image forgery.

4. **Unlocking the Device**: We then turned over the printed image and placed it on the touch sensor of Galaxy S6 and S7, as shown in Figure 2-(d). We successfully unlocked the target smartphones with the conductive print-out of the SCRAP image.

### Experimental Results

- **Full Submission Experiment**: As shown in Figure 3-(a), three participants successfully unlocked a Galaxy S7 using the full print-out of the SCRAP attack, typically in one or two attempts.
- **Half Submission Experiment**: For the same target devices, we asked participant P1 to submit only half of the print-out for unlocking. As shown in Figure 3-(b), P1 unlocked the Galaxy S7 in two to four attempts. Given that Galaxy S6 and S7 allow up to 14 failed attempts in the first hour (and 37 in the first 24 hours), our attack poses a significant risk to Samsung Galaxy series devices.

### Limitations and Alternative Methods

- **iPhone Series**: Unfortunately, the conductive printing method was ineffective against iPhone series, even with a firm impression. Therefore, we explored the wood glue method for iPhones.

### Wood Glue and 3D Printing

Wood glue is a commonly used material for fingerprint spoofing attacks. We verified that wood glue, when applied to a firm impression of a fingerprint, can bypass Touch ID on iPhones (Table 1). To adapt this method for the SCRAP image, we are working on 3D modeling and printing a fake 3D fingerprint, which will be used to create a candle-based mold. This mold will then be used to apply wood glue and produce a forged fingerprint.

### Mitigation Strategy

To address the forgery issues, we propose a mitigation method assuming the use of under-screen touch sensors, which can capture a larger area of the user’s fingerprint. Apple, Samsung, and other manufacturers are planning to introduce under-screen fingerprint recognition systems that use acoustic imaging [3] or conductive scanning [8].

Our proposed mitigation method involves a slight modification of the slide bar interface used in previous iPhone models. The user is asked to unlock the device by sliding a circle left or right. When the user touches the circle, the under-screen touch sensor reads the fingerprint. The swiping action removes the fingerprint smudge, as shown in Figure 4-(d). Additionally, we propose reading the remaining smudges (Figure 5-(c) and (f)) to distinguish between real and fake fingerprints.

### Conclusion

We conducted post hoc experimental studies on the SCRAP attack [5], which is a practical method to circumvent fingerprint identification on smartphones. We validated prior fingerprint spoofing techniques and combined them with new methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the SCRAP attack. Our mitigation method assumes the adoption of under-screen touch sensors, expected to be implemented in the near future. We plan to conduct a survey to understand user perception of these attacks and the proposed mitigation methods.
