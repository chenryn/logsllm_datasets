### Table 5: Manual Analysis Results in Percent of Samples

The following percentages indicate the distribution of various characteristics among the samples. The samples, labeled as cracks or keygens for specific products, did not always have the intended functionality. Some were actual cracks or keygens for different versions or products, while others were simply malware.

| **Product** | **Real C/K** | **Wrong C/K** | **Bare MW.** | **File Inf.** | **Sys. Inf.** | **VT avg.** | **Anubis avg.** | **NW Traf.** | **Work.** | **Work. Clean** |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Photoshop   | 66.67%       | 60.00%        | 33.33%       | 66.67%       | 13.33%       | 62.06%      | 11.43%          | 20.00%       | 13.33%    | 0.00%           |
| Office 2010 | 50.00%       | 30.00%        | 20.00%       | 50.00%       | 10.00%       | 50.00%      | 10.00%          | 15.00%       | 10.00%    | 0.00%           |
| ...         | ...          | ...           | ...          | ...          | ...          | ...         | ...             | ...          | ...       | ...             |

**Note:** 
- **Real C/K**: Percentage of samples that are actual cracks or keygens for the specified product.
- **Wrong C/K**: Percentage of real cracks or keygens that are for different versions or products.
- **Bare MW.**: Percentage of samples that are bare malware.
- **File Inf.**: Percentage of samples reported as infected by AV engines.
- **Sys. Inf.**: Percentage of samples that caused system infections.
- **VT avg.**: Average detection rate by VirusTotal.
- **Anubis avg.**: Average maliciousness score by Anubis.
- **NW Traf.**: Percentage of samples causing network traffic.
- **Work.**: Percentage of working cracks and keygens.
- **Work. Clean**: Percentage of working cracks and keygens that are free from malware.

### Analysis of Malware Distribution

Our analysis reveals that cracks and keygens serve as an effective channel for distributing malware. This makes them a valuable source of revenue for underground actors such as Pay Per Install (PPI) providers, PPD, One-Click hosters, dedicated crack hosters, specialized crack search engines, and similar entities.

- **Working Cracks/Keygens**: For applications, only 13.95% of the tools worked and were free from malware. For games, this figure was 25.35%.
- **System Infections**: More than 22% of the samples managed to successfully infect the system.

### Control Analysis

We submitted all 141 manually collected unique samples to VirusTotal and Anubis for both static and dynamic analysis. 

- **VirusTotal**: 91.49% of the samples had existing reports, indicating they had been scanned before. The average detection ratio (VT avg.) reflects the likelihood of infection.
- **Anubis**: The average severity score (Anubis avg.) indicates how malicious the samples behaved in the analysis environment.

### Sample Age

To determine the age of our samples, we analyzed the first seen dates in VirusTotal reports. A sample was considered infected if at least 30% of the AV scanners reported malware. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) in Figure 4 shows that a significant number of samples were new, suggesting they were either freshly repacked or 0-day malware.

### Malware Distribution on Download Sources

We compared the number of unique downloads with the number of infected ones (detection percentage > 30%) across different download sources (Web, OCH, and BitTorrent). Figure 5 shows that web sources had slightly more infected downloads, likely due to their ease of use and wide user base.

### Automatically Collected Samples

We also analyzed over 43,600 download links leading to 3,491 unique cracks and keygen executables.

- **VirusTotal and Anubis Analysis**: 36.32% (1,268 samples) were previously unknown to VirusTotal. The CDF in Figure 6 shows that about 50% of the samples would be infected based on existing reports, and 55% based on fresh reports.
- **Malware Families**: The most frequent families were Trojans, often connecting to the Internet, suggesting potential use by PPI providers.
- **Sample Age**: Similar to manual samples, many automatically collected samples were very new, as shown in Figure 7.
- **Malware Packing**: UPX was the most frequent packer used, but only 10.63% of possibly infected samples used a detected packer, indicating a higher number of undetected packed malware.

### Conclusion

Cracks and keygens are a significant vector for malware distribution, with a high likelihood of containing malicious content. Both manual and automated analysis confirm that these tools are frequently repacked and distributed through various channels, making them a lucrative target for cybercriminals.
