# Real World Privacy: Strategies and Considerations
## DEFCON 12, July 30, 2004

### Mail and Communications
- **Omit the return address.**
- **Pay in cash, even at FedEx.** Using exact change can be helpful.
  
#### Additional Tips for Mail Privacy
- **Opt out of mailing lists.** You can avoid being on these lists in the first place by registering with the DMA (Direct Marketing Association) Mail Preference Service. 
  - **Mail:** P.O. Box 9008, Farmington, NY 11735-9008
  - **Online:** [www.the-dma.org/consumers/offmailinglist.html](http://www.the-dma.org/consumers/offmailinglist.html)
- **Use aliases.** Employ multiple aliases or slightly alter your name to protect your identity.
  - **Example Aliases:** I.P. Freely, Ivann Peter Freely, Ivan Freely, Jon, John, Johne, Jonn, Johnn
- **Magazine and newspaper subscriptions.** Avoid subscribing under your real name. Instead, consider buying from newsstands, which may be less convenient but offer more privacy.

### Computer-Based Communications
- **Data Logging.** Ensure that data logging is one-sided and dynamic, particularly for email and IP addresses.
- **Data Management.** Regularly shred, overwrite, and delete unnecessary data. Make sure backups do not copy sensitive information, and ensure that data is destroyed on backups as well.
- **Encryption.** Encrypt your emails, even though it takes time. For chat, use encrypted services like Trillian or IRC.
- **Multiple Email Addresses.** Use various email addresses or at least aliases for inbound email to minimize exposure.

### Education
#### K-12
- **Consider Home Schooling or Private Schools.** These options provide alternatives to traditional public schooling.
- **Address Requirements.** Enrolling in a school district requires presenting an actual address. Be cautious about sharing additional information, such as where parents work or multiple contact numbers.
- **Minimize Information Sharing.** Limit the amount of personal information provided to the school. Educate your children on the importance of privacy.
- **Written Requests.** Insist, in writing, that the school does not disclose personal information, especially for high school students who are often targeted by colleges.
- **SAT/ACT Information.** Be vigilant about the information shared during standardized testing.

#### College and Beyond
- **Need-Based Scholarships.** Weigh the benefits against the cost of sharing personal information.
- **Living on Campus.** Consider the pros (easier access to judicial systems) and cons (loss of privacy due to contracts).
- **Roommates.** Be cautious with roommates you don't know.
- **Internet Access.** Use school systems for internet access, but be aware of potential risks.
- **Information Theft.** Even after leaving school, your information can still be at risk. Check the college's privacy policy and track record of security breaches.

### Surveillance
- **Shoulder Surfing.** Be aware of who might be watching over your shoulder.
- **Listening In.** Be mindful of what you say, as others may be listening.
- **Surveillance Cameras.** There are approximately 9,000 surveillance cameras in Manhattan, and embedded cameras are increasingly common in places like gym locker rooms.
- **Face Recognition.** This technology is used in high-profile events like the Olympics, Super Bowl, and casinos.
- **Van Eck Emissions.** Be aware of the potential for electronic eavesdropping.

### Life Events
- **Medical Visits.** Be cautious about who has access to your medical data, including administrative staff, insurance companies, drug companies, researchers, government, employers, and law enforcement.
- **Limit Information Sharing.** For sensitive issues, consider visiting free clinics or people's clinics outside your local area. Pay in cash and use a different name. Avoid giving consent to share information unless absolutely necessary.
- **Health Fairs.** Use local health fairs for screenings, but avoid locations near your home or workplace to maintain privacy.
- **Cash Payments.** Pay in cash for treatments and prescriptions to avoid leaving a financial trail.
- **Non-Chain Providers.** Visit non-chain doctors and pharmacies in non-NASPER states (National All Schedule Prescriptions Electronic Reporting Act).

### Legal and Personal Events
- **Births, Divorces, and Deaths.** These events are often announced in newspapers and are part of public records. Be cautious about the information included in obituaries.
- **Marriage Announcements.** Consider getting married out of the area and avoiding announcements in the newspaper.
- **Hospital Records.** Hospitals may sell records to various entities, so discuss privacy concerns before being admitted.
- **HIPAA.** The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) may offer some protections, but its impact is still evolving.

### Interactions with Law Enforcement
- **Avoidance.** If possible, avoid interactions with law enforcement to maintain privacy.
- **Arrests.** If arrested, local lawyers may receive emails about your case and contact you. Police also use digital video dashboard cameras, keeping each day's footage for 90 days regardless of any crime or ticket.

### Fun Facts and Figures
- **Experian.** Has demographic data on 215 million consumers and 110 million households across the country.
- **U.S. Treasury Department.** Plans to publish nearly 10,000 email addresses on the web, violating privacy promises.
- **Identity Theft.** More than three million people in the U.S. were victims of identity-theft-related fraud in the past year.
- **Television Licensing Authority.** In Britain, this authority can obtain warrants to break into and search residences.

### Concerns and Warnings
- **LexisNexis.** Offers anti-money laundering solutions.
- **Flight Simulator Questions.** Can lead to visits from the police.
- **Public Reading.** Reading certain materials in public can attract unwanted attention.
- **Employee Computer Crime.** Insider threats are on the rise.
- **Tax Cheats.** States are using new technologies to gather information and profile individuals.
- **College Data Leaks.** Confidential student data is often compromised by internet intrusions.
- **Airlines and Hotels.** Face customer concerns due to anti-terrorism efforts.
- **Rental Cars.** Drivers' movements are often tracked.

### The Bright Side
- **Florida’s Public Record Law.** Provides protections for personal information that could endanger an individual.
- **Privacy Support Groups.** There are organizations and resources available to help maintain privacy.
- **Canada.** Privacy is seen as good business practice.

### Thoughts on the Future
- **RFID.** Tracking individuals and their belongings.
- **Legislation.** MATRIX, Patriot Act II, and other intelligence acts.
- **Genetic Testing.** Increasing use of genetic data.
- **Biometrics.** Growing reliance on biometric identification.
- **Data Outsourcing.** Increased data collection and storage, with no plans for deletion.
- **Privacy Rights.** The fundamental right to privacy is under threat, and action is needed to protect it.

### Closing Thoughts
- **George Radwanski, Privacy Commissioner of Canada:** "The fundamental human right of privacy in Canada is under assault as never before. Unless the government of Canada is quickly dissuaded from its present course by Parliamentary action and public insistence, we are on a path that may well lead to the permanent loss not only of privacy rights that we take for granted but also of important elements of freedom as we now know it."
