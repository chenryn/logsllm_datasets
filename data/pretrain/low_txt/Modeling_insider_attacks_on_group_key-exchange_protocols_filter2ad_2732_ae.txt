#### Section: Proof of Key Consistency

When a simulated copy of \(\mathcal{A}\) being run by \(U_j\) generates a signature on \((U_j, s_{idj}, p_{idj}, ack_j)\), it indicates that \(U_j\) has completed its execution of \(\mathcal{A}\). It remains to show that the value \(sk'_j\) held by \(U_j\) is identical to the value \(sk'_i\) held by \(U_i\).

By the construction of the compiler, we have \(F_{sk_i}(v_0) = ack_i = F_{sk_j}(v_0)\). Since \(F\) is a collision-resistant pseudorandom function (PRF), it follows that \(sk_i = sk_j\) except with negligible probability. Assuming this, we then have:
\[ sk'_j = F_{sk_j}(v_1) = F_{sk_i}(v_1) = sk'_i, \]
as desired.

**Corollary 7.** Except with negligible probability, any uncorrupted players \(U_i\) and \(U_j\) who share the same values of \(sid\) and \(pid\) and who output a session key will in fact output the same session key.

#### Summary of Differences from Z's Perspective

We now summarize the differences, from the perspective of \(Z\), between an interaction of \(Z\) with \(A\) and with \(S\). The summary includes sketches of proofs that these differences are not noticeable to \(Z\).

- **Steps 1, 2, and 3 of \(S\):** These steps do not introduce any differences from the perspective of \(Z\).
- **Step 4(a)(i):** This step introduces two differences. First, \(S\) may abort. Second, the key output by the "dummy" player \(U'_i\) (as observed by \(Z\)) is chosen uniformly at random by FGKE, not as \(sk'_j\).

  - **Probability of Abortion:** If \(S\) aborts at this step, it means that FGKE has not yet sent \((sid, pid, ready)\) to \(S\), or equivalently, there exists some player \(U'_k\) from whom FGKE has not yet received \((sid, pid, new-session)\). Claim 6 shows that, except with negligible probability, all uncorrupted players in \(pid\) have completed their execution of \(\mathcal{A}\) and thus have sent \((sid, pid, new-session)\) to FGKE. Since all players in \(pid\) are uncorrupted in step 4(a)(i), \(S\) aborts here with only negligible probability.
  
  - **Indistinguishability of Session Keys:** We claim that it is computationally indistinguishable (from the perspective of \(Z\)) whether the "dummy" player \(U'_i\) outputs a random session key (as it does in the ideal world) or \(U_i\) outputs the session key \(sk'_i\) (as would occur in the real world). This can be considered in two cases:
    1. **No Further Corruptions:** If \(A\) never corrupts any players in the remainder of its execution, this claim follows readily from Corollary 7, the assumed AKE-security of \(\mathcal{A}\), and the pseudorandomness of \(F\).
    2. **Future Corruptions:** If \(A\) later corrupts some players in \(pid\), due to the way corruptions are handled by \(S\), this will not introduce any noticeable difference from the perspective of \(Z\).

- **Step 4(a)(ii):** The key output by the "dummy" player \(U'_i\) (as observed by \(Z\)) is chosen uniformly at random by FGKE, not as \(sk'_i\). This is inconsequential for similar reasons as in step 4(a)(i).

- **Step 4(b)(i):** \(S\) may abort if there is some uncorrupted player in \(pid\) who has not yet sent \((sid, pid, new-session)\) to FGKE. As argued in step 4(a)(i), this occurs with only negligible probability.

  - **Key Matching:** The key \(sk'_i\) that \(S\) sends to FGKE matches exactly the key that the uncorrupted player \(U_i\) outputs. Corollary 7 indicates that, except with negligible probability, if the simulated copy of \(\mathcal{A}'\) being run on behalf of any other honest player later outputs a session key, that key will be \(sk'_i\).

- **Step 4(b)(ii):** \(U_i\) has output a session key \(sk'_i\), and at the time the first uncorrupted player (say, \(U_j\)) accepted, all players in \(pid\) were uncorrupted. Corollary 7 shows that, with all but negligible probability, the key \(sk'_i\) output here is identical to the key previously output by \(U_j\). Similarly, the session keys output by the "dummy" parties \(U'_i\) and \(U'_j\) (which are observed by \(Z\)) will be identical.

- **Step 4(b)(iii):** \(S\) may abort if there was an uncorrupted player who previously output session key \(sk''_i\). Corollary 7 indicates that every uncorrupted player who outputs a session key will output the same session key \(sk''_i\). Thus, \(S\) will not abort except with negligible probability.

- **Steps 5(a) and 5(c):** These steps do not introduce any differences from the perspective of \(Z\).

- **Step 5(b):** If \(S\) has sent an "ok" message to FGKE, there must be some other player \(U_j\) (different from the player \(U_i\) being corrupted in this step) who was uncorrupted at the time it accepted. From Claim 6, this means that with all but negligible probability, \(U_i\) indeed has a value \(ack_i\) as part of its internal state. Including the value \(\beta\) (that was output already by the "dummy" player \(U'_j\)) in the internal state is computationally indistinguishable from using the actual session key computed by \(U_i\).

This completes our sketch of the proof.

### Conclusion

This paper provides a formal and comprehensive way of modeling insider attacks in group key-exchange protocols by suggesting an ideal functionality for group key exchange within the Universal Composability (UC) framework. We show that the definition introduced here is strictly stronger than that of AKE-security and encompasses prior definitions of security against insider attacks. We then present a simple and efficient compiler that transforms any AKE-secure protocol into one secure with respect to our definition. We hope the framework introduced here will provide a basis for future work analyzing the security of existing group key-exchange protocols and will also serve as a tool toward developing more efficient protocols secure against insider attacks.
