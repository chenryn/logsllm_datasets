### Fair Exchange Protocol for Cross-Chain Trading

To achieve a fair exchange, we adapt a protocol for atomic cross-chain trading, which is compatible with Bitcoin. This protocol allows two users to fairly exchange units of one currency for an appropriate amount of another currency. The exchange is designed such that either both parties successfully complete the transaction, or neither party receives any currency, ensuring that it is impossible for one user to reclaim their currency while the other does not.

For those less concerned with Bitcoin compatibility, a simpler approach like "pay on reveal secret" [33] can be used. For more details on this protocol, see Andrew Miller's explanation on bitcointalk.org [9].

### Adaptation for Central Bank Control

To fit our setting, where central banks may want to maintain control over which currencies can be traded and in what volumes, we modify the existing protocol. Specifically, we require a third party to sign both transactions if they involve currencies deemed "exchangeable" by that party. This modification serves two purposes: it signals the third party's approval of the exchange and binds the two transactions together across their respective blockchains.

Our proposed protocol thus enables transparent exchanges that can be approved by a third party, but it does not (and cannot) prevent exchanges from occurring without this approval. Importantly, an auditor with access to both blockchains can now observe and verify the exchange.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we present RSCoin, the first cryptocurrency framework that provides central banks with the control over monetary policy they expect to retain. By making minimal alterations to the design of successful cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, we demonstrate that centralization can be achieved while maintaining the transparency guarantees that have made fully decentralized cryptocurrencies so attractive.

We also propose a new consensus mechanism based on 2PC (two-phase commit) and measure its performance. Our results show that centralizing some authority allows for a more scalable system to prevent double spending, completely avoiding the wasteful hashing required in proof-of-work-based systems.

### Appendix

#### Atomic Trading Protocol

In Section VII-C, we described a protocol for atomic trading of different currencies and outlined some of its features, such as allowing trade only across authorized currencies (as determined by some third party). Our formal protocol that achieves this fair exchange is presented in Figure 5.

**Informal Description:**

If Alice and Bob wish to exchange \( m \) units of currency \( c_1 \) for \( n \) units of currency \( c_2 \), with the blessing of a third party Carol, they each create two types of transactions:
- A "spend" transaction, where the sender releases the units of currency to one of two addresses.
- A "refund" transaction, where the sender can reclaim the currency after a certain amount of time has passed.

The two addresses in Alice’s spend transactions are:
- A "multi-signature" address from which funds can be released only with the signatures of Alice, Bob, and Carol.
- Bob’s address, from which he can spend the funds only with knowledge of the pre-image of some hash \( H(x) \).

**Formal Protocol:**

1. **Alice's Initial Steps:**
   - Alice creates her spend and refund transactions.
   - She picks a value \( x \) and computes \( H(x) \).
   - She commits to the currency \( c_2 \) being traded with using a second hash \( h_2 \).
   - Alice sends the refund transaction, signed by herself, to Carol.

2. **Carol's Approval:**
   - If Carol is satisfied with the proposed exchange, she signs the transaction and gives this signature to Alice.
   - Alice solicits a signature from Bob.
   - Once she has signatures from both Bob and Carol, she has a transaction that she can use to refund her currency after time \( t_1 \) has passed.
   - Alice publishes the spend transaction in the blockchain for \( c_1 \).

3. **Bob's Initial Steps:**
   - Bob follows suit by creating his own spend and refund transactions.
   - He solicits signatures from Alice and Carol.
   - Once he has a valid refund transaction, he publishes his spend transaction.

4. **Completion of the Exchange:**
   - Once both transactions are accepted into their respective blockchains, Alice, who knows the pre-image \( x \), can redeem the \( n \) units of currency \( c_2 \) using Bob’s spend transaction.
   - In doing so, she implicitly reveals \( x \).
   - Bob can now redeem the \( m \) units of currency \( c_1 \) using Alice’s spend transaction, and the exchange is complete.
   - If Alice does not redeem Bob’s spend transaction, then after time \( t_2 \), Bob can use his refund transaction to reclaim the currency himself.

This ensures a fair and transparent exchange, with the option for third-party approval and the ability for an auditor to observe the process.
