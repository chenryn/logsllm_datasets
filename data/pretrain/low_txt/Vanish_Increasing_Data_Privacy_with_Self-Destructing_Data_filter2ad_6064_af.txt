### Defense Against Sybil Attacks

To defend against Sybil attacks, the identity of a Vuze node is constrained to a function of its IP address and port modulo 1999. While this measure may be sufficient for the initial stages of Vanish deployment, stronger defenses are available. For example, certified identities [26] and periodic cryptographic puzzles [9] can provide robust protection against Sybil attacks. Additionally, various other defenses against Eclipse attacks [14, 51] have been proposed. Given that the core Vanish system is network-agnostic, it could be easily ported to more robust DHTs that implement these stronger defenses.

Moreover, if Vanish-style systems become popular, Vanish-specific defenses could be developed. These defenses could leverage the tight coupling between Vanish and the identities provided by PGP public keys. Although our focus has been on the Vuze DHT, which presents interesting and challenging security analysis due to its communal model, Vanish could also distribute keys across multiple DHTs or even DHTs and managed systems, as previously noted (Section 4). The different trust models, properties, and risks in these systems would significantly complicate an attacker's task.

### Related Work

We have discussed a significant amount of related work in Section 2 and throughout the text. As additional related work, the Adeona system also leverages DHTs for increased privacy, although with significantly different goals [55]. Several existing companies aim to achieve similar objectives (e.g., self-destructing emails), but with very different threat models, where company servers must be trusted [20]. Incidents involving Hushmail, however, may lead users to question such trust models [59].

There is also research aimed at destroying archived data where the data owner has the ability to explicitly and manually erase extra data maintained elsewhere, e.g., [8]. We avoid such processes, which may not always succeed and may be vulnerable to accidental copying or disclosures. Finally, albeit with different goals and perspectives, Rabin proposes an information-theoretically secure encryption system that leverages a decentralized collection of dedicated machines continuously serving random pages of data [52], which is related to the limited storage model [33]. Communicants who pre-share symmetric keys can download and XOR specific pages together to derive a one-time pad. The commonality between our approach and Rabin’s is the use of external machines to assist in privacy; however, the model, reliance on dedicated services, and pre-negotiation of symmetric keys between communicants are among the central differences.

### Conclusions

Data privacy has become increasingly important in our litigious and online society. This paper introduced a new approach for protecting data privacy from attackers who retroactively obtain, through legal or other means, a user’s stored data and private decryption keys. A novel aspect of our approach is the leveraging of the essential properties of modern P2P systems, including churn, complete decentralization, and global distribution under different administrative and political domains. We demonstrated the feasibility of our approach by presenting Vanish, a proof-of-concept prototype based on the Vuze global-scale DHT. Vanish causes sensitive information, such as emails, files, or text messages, to irreversibly self-destruct without any action on the user’s part and without any centralized or trusted system. Our measurement and experimental security analysis shed light on the robustness of our approach to adversarial attacks.

Our experience also reveals limitations of existing DHTs for Vanish-like applications. In Vuze, for example, the fixed data timeout and large replication factor present challenges for a self-destructing data system. Therefore, one exciting direction for future research is to redesign existing DHTs with our specific privacy applications in mind. Our plan to release the current Vanish system will help provide further valuable experience to inform future DHT designs for privacy applications.
