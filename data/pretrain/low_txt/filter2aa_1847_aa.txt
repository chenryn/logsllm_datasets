### Preface

#### How to Use This Guide

This guide is designed to help you administer various network services provided by Mac OS X Server. The chapters cover:

- DHCP
- DNS
- IP Firewall
- NAT
- VPN
- NTP
- IPv6 Support

Each chapter focuses on a specific service, providing information on how it works, its benefits, setup, and ongoing administration. The "Where to Find More Information" section at the end of each chapter directs you to additional resources.

#### Setting Up Mac OS X Server for the First Time

If you have not yet installed and set up Mac OS X Server, follow these steps:

1. Refer to the "Mac OS X Server Getting Started for Version 10.3 or Later" document for installation and setup instructions.
2. Review this guide to identify which services you want to set up and learn about the server applications you will use.
3. Read the relevant chapters for detailed setup procedures, paying attention to the "Setup Overview," "Before You Begin," and "Setting Up for the First Time" sections.

#### Getting Help for Everyday Management Tasks

For day-to-day administration tasks, such as changing settings, monitoring services, and viewing logs, use the on-screen help available with server administration programs. While all tasks are documented in this guide, on-screen help can provide quick, context-specific assistance.

#### Getting Additional Information

For more information about Mac OS X Server, refer to:

- "Mac OS X Server Getting Started for Version 10.3 or Later"
- [www.apple.com/server](http://www.apple.com/server)
- On-screen help on your server

### Chapter 1: DHCP Service

**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Service**

DHCP service allows you to manage and distribute IP addresses to client computers from your server. When you configure the DHCP server, you assign a block of IP addresses that can be made available to clients. Each time a client computer configured to use DHCP starts up, it looks for a DHCP server on the network. If a DHCP server is found, the client requests an IP address. The DHCP server checks for an available IP address and sends it to the client along with a lease period and configuration information.

**Using the DHCP Module in Server Admin**

You can use the DHCP module in Server Admin to:

- Configure and administer DHCP service
- Create and administer subnets
- Configure DNS, LDAP, and WINS options for client computers
- View DHCP address leases

**Benefits of DHCP Service**

- Efficiently manage IP addresses, especially when you have more clients than IP addresses.
- Simplify client configuration by setting DNS and LDAP options.

**Before You Set Up DHCP Service**

Read the following sections for important considerations:

- **Creating Subnets**: Group computers into subnets for easier administration. Each subnet needs a router to connect to other subnets.
- **Assigning IP Addresses Dynamically**: Assign IP addresses for a limited period (lease time). Short leases allow DHCP to reassign IP addresses on networks with more computers than available IP addresses.
- **Using Static IP Addresses**: Assign static IP addresses to devices that need a continuous Internet presence, such as web servers and printers.
- **Locating the DHCP Server**: Ensure routers can forward client broadcasts and DHCP server responses if the server is on a different subnet.
- **Interacting with Other DHCP Servers**: Coexist with other DHCP servers by using unique IP address pools. For LDAP auto-configuration, set up AirPort Base Stations in Ethernet-bridging mode.
- **Using Multiple DHCP Servers**: Configure multiple DHCP servers with unique IP address pools.
- **Assigning Reserved IP Addresses**: Avoid assigning reserved IP addresses (e.g., loopback and broadcast addresses).
- **Getting More Information on the DHCP Process**: Learn about the `bootpd` daemon and its advanced configuration options using the Terminal utility.

**Setting Up DHCP Service for the First Time**

If you used the Setup Assistant during installation, some DHCP information is already configured. Follow these steps to complete the setup:

1. **Create Subnets**: Define a pool of shared IP addresses for each subnet. See "Creating Subnets in DHCP Service" for detailed instructions.
