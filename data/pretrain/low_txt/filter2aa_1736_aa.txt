### Page 2
**Some of Our Customers**

### Page 3
**What Do We Want to Hack Today?**
1. All user’s passwords
2. Credit card data

### Page 4
**What's Inside a Smartphone? (Almost Everything)**
- Contacts and calendars
- Call logs and text messages
- Emails and chats
- Account and application passwords
- Web and Wi-Fi passwords
- Credit card data
- Documents, settings, and databases
- Web history and searches
- Pictures and videos
- Geolocation history, routes, and places
- Third-party app data
- Cached internet data
- System and application logs
- Social network activities

### Challenges
- Different platforms (Apple, Google, Microsoft)
- Many vendor-specific clouds
- Third-party cloud services
- Credentials needed (password or token)

### Benefits
- No physical access required
- Can be performed silently
- Backup
  - No standard way to obtain
  - May not be available
  - Contains almost all data from the device
- Sync
  - Limited set of data
  - Most critical real-time data
  - Synced across all devices
- Storage
  - Only files/documents
  - Easy to access

### Data Acquisition Methods: Cloud Acquisition Pros and Cons
- **JTAG/Chip-Off**
  - No test access port on many devices
  - Full disk encryption
- **Physical**
  - Limited compatibility
  - Data may be encrypted
- **Logical**
  - Limited compatibility
  - Bypassing screen lock is needed
- **Cloud**
  - Limited set of data
  - Need credentials
  - Legal problems

### Additional Notes
- Full device backups are sometimes available
- Third-party application data is usually not available
- Passwords are additionally encrypted with hardware-specific keys
- Daily backups (in the best case, until forced from the device)
- Backups cannot be forced remotely
- Third-party software is needed
- Almost no way to manage
- Slow access, long download
- Account might be locked due to 'suspicious activity'
