### Certificate Expiration
The DFN sends users two expiration warnings via email: the first 30 days before the user certificate expires, and the second 15 days before. These notifications encourage users to renew their certificates.

### History and Milestones
Our university began issuing S/MIME certificates in 2004. The original root certificate used to sign the initial CA (G1) expired in 2019. Starting from 2017, certificates were issued using a new root CA (G2). As a result, 479 certificates issued with the G1 CA had to be replaced with new certificates issued by the G2 root CA. Figure 10 in Appendix C illustrates the number of issued certificates per year. In the early years, the number of server and user certificates was roughly equal. However, the number of S/MIME certificates has increased more slowly compared to server certificates. A noticeable drop in requested certificates occurred in 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### III. Related Work
We discuss related work in two key areas and contextualize our research: user studies for end-to-end encryption with end users and email field studies.

#### A. End-to-End Encryption Studies for End Users
The usability of end-to-end encryption has been a research focus for decades. Whitten and Tygar's seminal work in 1999 evaluated the usability of PGP and identified challenges for end-users in a lab study [45]. Participants struggled with key management, particularly key exchange, and one participant even forgot the password for their key pair, necessitating the generation of a new one. Another participant could not encrypt an email, and others were unable to decrypt emails.

Following Whitten and Tygar, Garfinkel and Miller [20] and Roth [29] hypothesized that some of these challenges could be overcome by simplifying the key verification process. Their solutions involved omitting third-party key verification and instead using a trust-on-first-use (TOFU) approach. Garfinkel and Miller found that color-coding messages based on their signature status made users less susceptible to social engineering attacks [20].

Garfinkel et al. surveyed 470 merchants who received digitally-signed VAT invoices from Amazon and found that sending signed emails by default increased acceptance and trust [19], [21]. Ruoti et al. studied various self-designed and publicly available encryption tools to improve email encryption usability [31]–[33], [35]. Their research focused on key management, key distribution, and the automation of encryption. In several laboratory studies, participants rated at least one tool as usable and expressed interest in secure email, though they were unsure about when or how to use it [31], [32], [35]. Ruoti et al. concluded that while secure and usable systems have been tested in short-term studies, future research should investigate long-term usability and adoptability [30].

Atwater et al. and Lerner et al. proposed clients similar to Keybase to simplify key distribution [5], [25]. They suggested uploading users' public keys to a website and confirming ownership, allowing users to retrieve emails from the corresponding email address. Atwater et al. found that this key distribution mechanism enabled participants to send more encrypted emails and improved usability for webmail users. Lerner et al. compared their tool, Conﬁdante, with Mailvelope and showed that Conﬁdante reduced the error potential [25].

Bai et al. proposed encryption prototypes to study different key management approaches [8], [9]. Participants preferred registering their public keys on a webpage and automatically retrieving public keys of communication partners over manual key management. Fahl et al. examined Facebook message encryption mechanisms and found that automatic key management and key recovery capabilities are important for adoption [16].

McGregor et al. reported that journalists used PGP to encrypt emails during the Panama Papers investigation but faced obstacles with multiple devices, leading them to use secure messengers like Signal [27]. Gaw et al. interviewed nine employees and found that users flagged encrypted mails as urgent and found them annoying when used for all messages [22]. Mauriés et al. conducted a combined lab and field study where participants struggled with Enigmail for Thunderbird and the Mailvelope browser plugin [26].

In addition to email, mobile messaging apps like Signal, Threema, and WhatsApp have made end-to-end encryption widely available. WhatsApp, for example, introduced end-to-end encrypted messages by default in 2016 [43]. Abu-Salma et al. identified barriers to the adoption of end-to-end encryption, including incompatible tooling and misconceptions about its features [2]. They argued that fragmented userbases and lack of multi-device support significantly contribute to non-adoption. In another study, Abu-Salma et al. explored users' mental models and found misconceptions about the security properties of messengers [1].

Stransky et al. confirmed these findings in an online study with WhatsApp users, finding that security perceptions of end-to-end encryption in mobile messaging apps heavily depend on the reputation and expectations of the app provider [38]. Akgul et al. found that educational messages improved understanding of security concepts in isolation but did not significantly impact users' mental models in a realistic environment [3].

Overall, previous work has primarily focused on identifying barriers to adopting end-to-end encryption for email and mobile messaging apps, using laboratory and interview studies. In contrast, we aim to extend the toolbox of end-to-end encryption research by providing ground truth based on longitudinal field data, evaluating a large dataset including millions of data points from thousands of users over several years.

#### B. Email Field Studies
In addition to the user studies discussed above, researchers have conducted multiple field studies on email usage. In 1996, Whittaker and Sidner analyzed the mailboxes of 18 NotesMail users containing 2,482 emails and postulated email overload [44]. In 2006, Fisher et al. revisited this analysis with a sample of 600 mailboxes containing 28,660 emails, studying users' email sorting strategies and the impact of increased email volume [17].

Alrashed et al. studied a sample of anonymized email logs from Outlook Web Access over four months, containing about 800 million actions [4]. They found that most emails have a short lifetime and that deleting email is the most common action on messages users interacted with once. Avigdor-Elgrabli et al. analyzed a sample of donated mailboxes from a major email service provider, containing about 5 million emails, using machine learning techniques to identify relationships between emails [7].

Roth et al. performed a study with anonymized mailboxes from 17 voluntary users, containing approximately 139,000 emails, to investigate which security mechanisms would be most appropriate for their communication patterns [29]. They argued that out-of-band verification of keys would be more feasible than relying on public key certificates issued by third parties for individual non-commercial users.

Foster et al. scanned the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) configurations of about 300,000 major email providers and email generators in March 2014 and February 2015, finding that TLS is widely used but effective TLS certificate validation is low [18]. Durumeric et al. examined log data for SMTP handshakes of Google’s Gmail service from January 2014 to April 2015, comparing it with a snapshot of SMTP configurations of Alexa top million domains as of April 2015 [13]. They found that top mail providers proactively encrypted and authenticated messages, but these practices had yet to reach widespread adoption in a long tail of over 700,000 SMTP servers with less secure configurations. Ulrich et al. evaluated the PGP key database (SKS-Keyserver) in December 2009, examining 2.7 million keys, of which 400,000 were expired and 100,000 were revoked [42].

Overall, these field studies investigate the adoption and usability of email in a broader context, measure email servers' security configurations, and conduct small-scale security analyses of email encryption. We extend previous field studies by focusing on the adoption of email encryption using a longitudinal large field dataset.

### IV. Analyzing 27 Years of Email Data
Below, we provide detailed information on the data collection and analysis process in our work.

We performed a longitudinal analysis of a large email dataset in coordination with the technical staff of the university’s IT department, the data protection officer, and the university’s staff council (see Section IV-C for more details). We implemented a data collection pipeline to collect pseudonymized metadata for all email accounts, including the use of S/MIME and PGP, at our institution over the last 27 years. At no point did we collect email subject or body information to avoid the disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) to the researchers. We also ensured that metadata included neither email account names nor the departments’ names or subdomains. We aimed to keep the number of processing errors low and consistently tested the pipeline with our own mailboxes until no further processing errors occurred.

The IT department’s technical staff reviewed the pipeline for functionality and data protection aspects and then executed it on the university’s standby backup email server. The backup server is a hot-standby of the primary mail server and automatically takes over in case of a failure. Data between both servers is constantly synchronized, and as a result, the backup is identical to the live data. The backup server retains all email data, dating back to early 1994.

Figure 1 provides an overview of the nine-step processing pipeline:
1. Local testing environment on a small sample mailbox created specifically for our study.
2. Technical staff reviewed the initial pipeline and iteratively tested it against the full set of email boxes of the researchers and their own email boxes.
3. Exported the email boxes to JSON-formatted files.
4. Parsed and pseudonymized all emails.
5. Performed assertion checks on every email to ensure that neither the email address nor the domain was present in any result fields.
6a. Stored the resulting email metadata for further analysis on a secure server in the university’s computing center if the assertion check succeeded.
6b. Dropped all email metadata to avoid the leakage of private information if the assertion check failed.
7. Transferred pseudonymized results to the authors’ secure cloud storage.
8. Analyzed the pseudonymized results.

#### A. Data Collection Pipeline
The university uses Dovecot for their email servers, which offers an export feature to extract all emails as a JSON-formatted file. We implemented our processing pipeline using a large JSON file per mailbox containing all exported emails as input. For parallel processing, we used the GNU Parallel tool. On behalf of the researchers, the university’s IT staff executed the pipeline on the backup email server to ensure raw emails were not exposed to the researchers.

**General Information:**
- For each email, we collected the local user account, message ID, sender, and list of receiver email addresses.
- If present, we also collected the lists of carbon copy and blind carbon copy addresses for outgoing emails.
- We hashed all of these values using a secret salt and the SHA-256 hash function for pseudonymization.
- We grouped email users into: Student, Staff, Faculty, NX Unknown, and External.
- For data protection reasons, we did not collect the exact send and receive dates and times but only the corresponding week.
- If set, we collected the raw user agent string to identify email client software, operating system, and compute platform if possible.
- We grouped mailbox folders into: Inbox, Subfolder of Inbox, Outbox, Subfolder of Outbox, Junk, Trash, and Spam.
- For further cryptographic metadata analysis, we stored whether an email was signed and encrypted or contained Autocrypt headers. We use the term "cryptographic emails" for all emails that contained cryptographic metadata.

**Cryptographic Metadata:**
- For all cryptographic emails, we collected attached cryptographic metadata for S/MIME, PGP, and Autocrypt.
- For S/MIME, we collected the pseudonymized serial number of the leaf certificate, validity start and end date (granularity by week), the signing hash algorithm, the key size and key type (e.g., 2048 and RSA).
- We collected the key usage and extended key usage options (e.g., email signing, certificate signing, code signing), and the number of valid email addresses for each certificate.
- Finally, we collected the complete certificate chain, including all metadata for all signing certificates. We did not pseudonymize the serial numbers for non-leaf certificates.

- For PGP, we collected the key type (e.g., public key or a sub-key), the signature algorithm, and key length. For elliptic curve keys, we collected curve information as well as pseudonymized key IDs, and creation and expiration dates. For extended PGP keys, we collected update dates. If a key included subkeys, we also stored the above data for the subkeys.

The pipeline dropped all data (like email subject, email content, non-key attachments) that we excluded from our analysis.

#### B. Data Cleaning
We included all 81,647,559 emails and 37,463 email user accounts at our university from January 1994 to July 2021 in the initial analysis (cf. Section V-A). However, we excluded some emails and email user accounts based on the following procedure:

- **Processing Errors:** Parsing a dataset spanning millions of emails from over two decades, generated and sent by many different email clients and versions, posed a significant challenge. Our parser failed to parse 0.09% of the emails in the dataset. Due to privacy restrictions, we were not allowed to further investigate the root causes of parser failures. Appendix A provides more details on S/MIME and PGP-related parsing errors.
- **Inactive Email Accounts:** Our initial data set included 37,463 total user accounts. However, we identified 18,302 inactive email accounts for which we did not find any sent emails. Of these, 17,928 email accounts received but did not send emails, and 374 did neither receive nor send emails. Many students prefer to use their private email accounts instead of their automatically created university email accounts, leaving them inactive.
- **Invalid Dates:** We excluded 307,680 (0.38% of our dataset) emails with obviously forged header dates, e.g., year > 2021 (after data collection) and emails for which the date parser failed.

#### C. Ethical Concerns and Data Privacy
To conduct the large-scale measurement study on email data, our institutions, and specifically the institution where the data was collected and evaluated, did not require formal ethical review for this type of study. Therefore, we did not involve an ethics review committee. However, we followed our institutions' guidelines for good scientific practice, which includes ethical guidelines. Here, the institutions specifically place the burden of determination of whether research is ethical on the respective researchers. We intensively discussed within and outside our research team to determine possible concerns with this research project and whether it would be feasible. We concluded that, in addition to following laws and our institutions' ethics requirements, we should also follow the de facto ethics standards of the S&P community. The data used in this study can be described as pseudonymized data derived from human subjects, as mentioned in the Call for Papers.

In addition to ethics, we made sure to address all legal aspects of our research to adhere to strict German privacy protection laws and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Therefore, we involved the data protection officer and the works committee of the institution where the data was collected and evaluated, as required by German data protection regulations. We developed the data collection plan jointly with the data protection officer, with the goal of protecting users' privacy and adhering to the strict German data protection regulations and the regulations in the state of Lower Saxony. After more than a year of multiple discussions and hearings, we agreed on the presented data collection plan (cf. details in Section IV-A). After the involved authorities rigorously assessed the legal situation based on the GDPR, German data protection laws, and state law of the involved authorities, we were allowed to analyze pseudonymized metadata of all users at our institution without requiring user consent. Additionally, our legal counsel decreed that the benefit of our research to society outweighed the potential risks.
