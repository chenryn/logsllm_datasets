### Detailed Description
I am using the FFV1 codec provided by FFMPEG to record videos with `VideoWriter` in OpenCV. By default, this setup uses FFV1 version 3. However, I would like to change the codec to FFV1 version 1. In standard FFMPEG, this can be achieved by passing the `-level 1` flag.

Is it possible to achieve the same result using OpenCV? So far, I have not found any relevant information or documentation on how to do this.

I have also posted this question on the forum but have not received a response. Therefore, I am asking here as well.
