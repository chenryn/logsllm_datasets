# Isolating the RTT Contribution of AS2907

### Figure 6: Isolating the RTT Contribution of AS2907

**Figure 6(a)** shows the difference between the average Round-Trip Times (RTTs) up to the destination and up to the last hop within AS2907. The time intervals from 09:55 to 10:05 are plotted, with the RTT values ranging from -5 ms to 25 ms.

**Figure 6(b)** illustrates the contribution of AS2907 as a fraction of the entire RTT. The RTT contributions are shown for different times, with values ranging from 0 to 1.

### Home Network Contribution to the RTT

Recent research has highlighted the significant impact of home networks on Internet performance [6, 27]. However, traditional diagnostic tools or simply probing the home gateway may not always accurately determine if the home network is the cause of performance degradation [7].

When the home gateway behaves as a compliant node, our approach allows us to evaluate the RTT toward any destination and the contribution of the home network using a single packet probe. As a case study, we monitored the RTT toward a top-ranked Italian news website (repubblica.it). The monitored home network is connected to the Internet via an ADSL connection provided by Telecom Italia. The monitoring laptop is connected via Wi-Fi to a NETGEAR DGN2200v3, a common commercial modem-router that complies with our approach. To monitor the RTT, we used `D-WDDW` packet probes, where `W` is the private address of the modem-router. We approximate the home network contribution as `RTTS,D(S, W)`.

### Figure 7: Home Network RTT Contribution

**Figure 7(a)** shows the trend over time of the RTT chunks. Initially, the home network is unloaded. From 09:14 to 09:23, another Wi-Fi connected host started downloading and uploading large files through the Internet. During this overloaded period, the RTT increased by 356% (from 69.8 ms to 249 ms). However, the home network played only a minor role (see **Figure 7(b)**). On average, packets spent 4.7% and 2.6% of the entire RTT within the home network during the unloaded and overloaded periods, respectively. We also observed sporadic latency spikes in the home network, likely caused by contention-induced transmission delays over the wireless link. These spikes, which can represent more than 60% of the total RTT, disappear on a wired connection.

**Figure 7(c)** shows the home network RTT contribution over the last mile. By replicating the experiment and isolating the home network contribution, we found that downloading and uploading large files through the Internet does not affect the intra-home network delay but significantly increases the delay on the last mile.

### Conclusion

We presented an approach using a single packet to accurately dissect the RTT on the slow path into chunks mapped to specific portions of the end-to-end path. Our method uses the IP Timestamp option and a compliant router along the path. A large-scale measurement study from 116 vantage points, comprising 223K traced paths, showed that, on average, 2.5 routers per path are compliant. We demonstrated the utility of our approach through two case studies, showing how it can isolate the RTT contribution of the home network and of an entire Autonomous System (AS).
