## Abstract
Internet telephony has become a staple in global communication, yet there is limited understanding of how network performance affects user-perceived call quality and where such issues arise. To address this, we analyzed 430 million calls from Skype, spanning 1900 Autonomous Systems (ASes) and 126 countries. Our findings indicate that call quality problems are widespread and geographically dispersed, making localized solutions ineffective.

To mitigate these issues, we introduce VIA, an architecture that leverages classical overlay techniques to relay calls. This approach is particularly relevant given the recent emergence of private backbones connecting globally distributed data centers, which can serve as a managed overlay network. Trace-driven analysis shows that an oracle-based overlay can potentially improve up to 53% of calls affected by poor network performance. 

A key challenge is realizing these benefits in practice, given the significant spatial and temporal variability in network performance and the large number of relaying choices. We developed a practical relay selection approach that combines prediction-based filtering with an online exploration-exploitation strategy. Trace-driven analysis and a small-scale deployment show that VIA reduces the incidence of poor network conditions for calls by 45% (and for some countries and ASes by over 80%) while staying within a budget for relaying traffic through the managed network.

## Introduction
Over the past several years, Internet-based telephony has seen a dramatic rise, especially for long-distance international calling. Major content and social networking platforms now offer Internet calling capabilities, such as Skype, Google Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat, and FaceTime.

Despite the growing importance of Internet telephony and the critical role of network performance in user experience, there have been few large-scale systematic studies analyzing how network performance impacts user-perceived call quality and the typical characteristics of performance issues in the real world.

To bridge this gap, we analyzed network performance and user-perceived quality indices from one of the largest deployed VoIP services, Skype, which serves hundreds of millions of users and handles over a billion minutes of talk-time per day. Our dataset includes 430 million calls from seven months, spanning 135 million users across 126 countries. As expected, we found that call quality is strongly correlated with network performance metrics such as Round-Trip Time (RTT), packet loss rate, and jitter.

However, contrary to expectations, call quality issues are not confined to a few specific areas but are spread out geographically and over time. This makes simple fixes targeted at specific "pockets" of poor performance largely ineffective.

To address these issues, we propose revisiting the classical idea of overlay routing, which has been extensively researched. Overlay networks can improve performance by routing around bottlenecks in the default Internet paths. The adoption of overlay routing at scale has been hindered by the need to deploy the overlay infrastructure from scratch. However, the emergence of large cloud providers with geographically distributed data centers connected by managed backbone networks offers new opportunities to construct highly performant overlay alternatives.

Inspired by this, we envision a framework called VIA, which selectively routes VoIP calls over managed overlay servers. For instance, Microsoft could route a subset of Skype traffic through their managed network, and Google could do the same with Hangouts traffic. Indeed, Skype and Hangouts have already moved towards hybrid models, using both direct peer-to-peer paths and multi-hop relays in the cloud.

Managed overlays offer a pragmatic alternative to traditional user-defined overlays, as providers can carefully provision the servers, decide which calls to relay, and control how traffic is routed, ensuring the managed backbone network does not become a general-purpose conduit. Additionally, by tying the use of the managed overlay to a widely-used application, network conditions can be passively learned from the application's traffic, reducing the need for active probing.

We evaluated the potential of such relaying using trace-driven analysis of the Skype dataset. An "oracle" that looks into future network performance and identifies the best relay(s) can improve 53% of calls affected by poor network performance. Achieving this in practice, however, is challenging due to the significant spatial and temporal variability in network performance and the need to stay within a relaying budget.

VIA uses a prediction-guided exploration approach to decide which calls to relay and which relay(s) to use. It makes these decisions based on performance information from call history, which is often limited and skewed. The key insight is that even though available performance information may not suffice to predict the best relay for each call, it can help identify a small subset of promising relay choices. From this subset, an online exploration-exploitation strategy is used to find the optimal relay path while staying within the relaying budget.

Trace-driven simulations show that VIA's improvement in call quality closely matches that of an oracle. VIA helps reduce the incidence of poor network conditions for calls by up to 45% (and for some countries and ASes by over 80%). We also implemented a prototype of VIA with a cloud-based controller and modified Skype clients, and deployed and evaluated it on a small testbed of 18 client pairs across five countries, relaying calls through Skype’s managed relays.

## VoIP Performance in the Wild
In this section, we use call logs from Skype to quantify the impact of network metrics on audio call quality and the patterns of poor network performance. These observations motivate the design requirements of VIA.

### Dataset Description
The dataset from Skype consists of a sampled set of 430 million audio calls drawn from a seven-month period. The sampled set includes both calls that use the default path (e.g., BGP-derived) between the caller and the callee and calls that are relayed through managed relay nodes distributed across data centers in different locations. Note that today, such relaying is typically employed for connectivity (e.g., firewall or NAT traversal) rather than for performance optimization. Despite this bias, the dataset offers a panoramic view across diverse endpoints from 1,905 ASes across 126 countries. Table 1 summarizes the statistics.

| Time Period | Calls | Users | ASes | Countries/Regions |
|-------------|-------|-------|------|-------------------|
| 2015.11.15−2016.05.30 | 430M | 135M | 1.9K | 126 |

To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the quality of Internet telephony calls at such a large scale. Key characteristics of the dataset include a large fraction of international (46.6%), inter-AS (80.7%), and wireless (83%) calls. These characteristics allow us to study the performance of Internet telephony over a much greater diversity of Internet paths than previous studies, which were mostly US-centric or confined to server-client paths or academic sites.

Each call is associated with three network performance metrics: (i) round-trip time (RTT), (ii) loss rate, and (iii) jitter. These metrics are calculated by the Skype clients in accordance with the RTP specifications and correspond to the average value over the entire duration of a call. This section focuses on default-routed (BGP-derived) calls, while Section 3 considers relayed (overlay-routed) calls.

### Call Quality and Network Performance
For a small random fraction of calls in Skype, users label the call quality on a discrete 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). We deem calls with a rating of 1 or 2 as "poor" and use the fraction of such calls, termed the Poor Call Rate (PCR), as an empirical metric of user experience. Prior work has also provided analytical models to translate network metrics into a measure of audio call quality, called the Mean Opinion Score (MOS).

In this section, we show that both PCR and MOS are well-correlated with network metrics. We then identify suitable thresholds for poor call performance based on RTT, loss, and jitter. These thresholds help us focus directly on the impact of network performance metrics on call quality.
