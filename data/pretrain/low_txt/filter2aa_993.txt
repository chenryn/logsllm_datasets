### Previously in DEFCON...

#### Drones as a Threat
- **Flying Computers (IoT over your head):**
  - Custom payloads:
    - Sniffers
    - Jammers
    - Network Analyzers
    - 3D Mapping and Cameras
    - Physical Attacks and Explosives
    - And more...

#### Detection Methods
- **Thermal and Standard Cameras:**
  - AI for detecting drone shapes
  - Electronics and motor heat detection
- **Characterization of Drone Noise**
- **Radio Frequency and Waveform Detection:**
  - Radio signature analysis

#### Voluntary Measures
- **No-Fly Zones Controlled by Onboard GPS and Autopilots**
- **Real-Time Telemetry Transmission to COPS**
- **COPS' Ability to Take Down Drones**

#### Counter-Countermeasures
- **Spread-Spectrum Communication**
- **Frequency Hopping**
- **Using Unexpected Frequencies to Evade Jammers**
- **Robust Communication Protocols**

### First Round: “ATROPOS” Drone
- **WiFi Router**
- **PIC16F876 for PWM Control**
- **Wii Nunchuck and Motion+ as Onboard IMU**
- **HTML5 Telemetry via Router Webserver**
- **WiFi Communication**
- **WPS Attacks with Bully**

---

### Project “The Interceptor”
- **Key Features:**
  - **Minimum Size and Weight:** Harder to detect
  - **Low Budget:** ~$40 + $20 with SDR
  - **Hacking Capabilities**
  - **Resilient Control**

#### Vocore2
- **PWM Generation:**
  - Need to generate 4 PWM signals for motor control
  - Real-time constraints require specific hardware
  - Only 2 channels initially enabled; need to disable UART2 and enable all 4 PWM channels in the device tree

##### Forum Discussion
- **Question from a User:**
  - "How can I enable all PWM?"

##### Pinmux Configuration
- **Reconfiguration in `mt7628an.dtsi`:**
  - Redefine pinmux
  - ADC chip declaration for battery monitoring
  - Disable UART2
  - Enable all 4 PWM channels

##### Power Stage
- **Components:**
  - Brushed motors (cost-effective)
  - MOSFET
  - Capacitor
  - Schottky diode

##### Electrical Motor Behavior and PID Tuning
- **PID Tuning for Optimal Performance**

### Interceptor WiFi Architecture
- **Joystick and Drone Control:**
  - 802.11 beacon injection
  - AES encryption for telemetry
  - Web interface for channel management
  - AES decryption and websocket communication

- **Pilot and Aircraft Side:**
  - Header and AP configuration
  - Command structure including gas, pitch, roll, yaw, sequence number, and SHA256
  - Forged Beacon Frame injection

- **Channel Management:**
  - Dynamic channel switching for robust communication

##### YAW Indicator
- **Features:**
  - Sequence number
  - Target channel
  - Current/target channel
  - Pitch/roll indicator
  - WiFi mode (monitor or mon+sta/ap)
  - ADC voltage
  - Audit console/camera
  - Motor PWM levels

### Fallback FM-Based TX
- **For Complete WiFi Jamming Scenarios:**
  - Transmit with an arbitrary frequency
  - Demo in the FM band
  - Transmitting in illegal frequencies is a minor issue for bad actors
  - Raspberry Pi radio transmission causes harmonics, which may be problematic

##### FM Transmission Setup
- **Components:**
  - Joystick
  - Pilot (Raspberry Pi)
  - FSK modulation
  - RF format conversion
  - FM modulated transmission
  - GPIO 4 bytes packet
  - SDR FM capture
  - Wav audio conversion
  - FSK demodulation
  - 4-byte flight control
  - Connected to antenna
  - Timeout handling
