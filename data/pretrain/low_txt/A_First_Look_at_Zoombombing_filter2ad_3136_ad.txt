### User Entry into Meetings Using Meeting ID

If a user attempts to join a meeting using only the meeting ID instead of the full meeting invite link (during the week of March 30, 2020), several issues can arise. This section focuses on the characteristics of zoombombing links, specifically whether they contain information about the targeted organizations and if they include a password as a URL parameter.

#### Characteristics of Zoombombing Links

In this section, we analyze the zoombombing links to understand what information they provide about the victim organizations and whether they include passwords as URL parameters.

**Targeted Organizations:**

To identify which organizations are victims of zoombombing, we examined the subdomains in the URLs. Services like Zoom and Webex allow organizations to set up custom subdomains (e.g., `https://virginia.zoom.us/j/123456789` for the University of Virginia and `https://pacificbuddhistacademy.my.webex.com` for the Pacific Buddhist Academy). Our analysis found that most zoombombing links posted on platforms like 4chan and Twitter are generic and do not contain specific subdomains. Only 12 out of the analyzed links contained specific subdomains, identifying 10 institutions. On Twitter, two links contained specific subdomains for one institution. 

- **Education Institutions:** 
  - 4chan: 8 links belonged to educational institutions, including one high school (Evergreen PS in Washington) and four U.S. universities (e.g., Arizona State University), as well as three international universities (e.g., Concordia in Canada).
  - Twitter: No specific education subdomains were found.

In Section VI-A, we will further discuss how the text of zoombombing posts often provides additional context about the targeted institution.

**Password Protection:**

Zoom and Webex allow hosts to protect their meetings with passwords. For Zoom, the password can be embedded in the link as a URL parameter (e.g., `https://zoom.us/j/123456789?pwd=12345aAbBcC678`). We found that 20 out of 123 zoombombing invitations on 4chan and 64 out of 95 on Twitter included passwords. This is noteworthy because Zoom added default password protection after the quarantine began, specifically to combat zoombombing. The presence of passwords in zoombombing links increased over time, particularly after Zoom enabled this feature by default (see Figure 9).

### Analysis of Zoombombing and Non-Bombing Links

To differentiate between zoombombing and non-bombing links, we analyzed the most similar words to "meetinglink" using cosine similarity of word embedding vectors from our trained models.

**Word Analysis:**

- **4chan:**
  - Zoombombing: Words related to education (e.g., "lecture," "class") and business (e.g., "meeting," "conference").
  - Non-Bombing: Keywords related to trolling and political discussions.

- **Twitter:**
  - Zoombombing: References to education (e.g., "zoomclass") and attacks (e.g., "raiding").
  - Non-Bombing: Keywords related to conference meetings, reflecting the public nature of many shared meeting URLs.

**Visualizing Discussion Themes:**

To identify recurring themes in zoombombing content, we created a two-hop ego network centered around "meetinglink" using word2vec models. Edges were weighted with cosine similarity, and we used the Louvain algorithm to detect communities, visualized with Gephi's ForceAtlas2 algorithm.

- **4chan (Figure 10):**
  - Educational topics (e.g., "spanish," "course," "skype").
  - Security and conspiracies (e.g., "ccp," "tiktok," "spyware").

- **Twitter (Figure 11):**
  - Online classes (e.g., "class," "history," "math").
  - Hashtags for visibility (e.g., "zoomcodeclass," "zoombomb," "zoomraids").

**Non-Bombing Content:**

- **4chan (Figure 12):**
  - Themes related to World War II and Nazi Germany.
  
- **Twitter (Figure 13):**
  - Research and webinars.

### Qualitative Analysis: Forum Content

Our quantitative analysis revealed several key aspects of zoombombing, such as the targeting of online classes and the inclusion of meeting passwords. However, quantitative analysis alone cannot capture the nuanced context. In this section, we conduct a more thorough qualitative analysis, informed by our quantitative results, to answer deeper questions.

**Phase I: Call for Attack**

- **Targeting the Classroom:**
  - 4chan: 91 out of 123 zoombombing threads targeted online classes. The remaining 32 threads targeted business meetings or had unclear targets.
  - Twitter: 56 out of 95 bombing calls targeted schools.

- **Evidence of Insiders' Complicity:**
  - 4chan: 20 out of 123 threads included passwords, indicating insider involvement.
  - Twitter: 64 out of 95 tweets included passwords in the zoombombing links.

Additional indicators, such as the text in the posts, can help qualitatively determine if an attack is called by an insider.
