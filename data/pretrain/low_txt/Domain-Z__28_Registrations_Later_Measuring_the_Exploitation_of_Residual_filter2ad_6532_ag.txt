### Window Timespan for Observations

**Figure 7: Window Timespan Required for W Observation Days**

This figure illustrates the window timespan required for W observation days versus the distance between the date of change and the closest observation. It highlights the best performance Alembic can achieve given the sparse nature of DNS resolutions for the domains in DZ.

**Key Points:**
- The effectiveness of Alembic depends on the frequency of DNS resolutions for a domain.
- Alembic requires at least W/2 observation days before and after the candidate date.
- The span of the observation window is determined by the resolution frequency of the domain.
- In the best case, the window may span W consecutive days, meaning the domain saw a DNS resolution on all W days.
- In the worst case, the domain may only be resolved once over the dataset's collection period.
- We cap the date range necessary to collect W days of resolution behavior at 120 days.
- The date range of the observation window with respect to the number of days away from an exact match is shown in Figure 7.
- Out of all changes, 4,543 (25.5%) fall within an Alembic observation window.
- Encouragingly, most ownership change events occurred within ten days of an observation (red line in Figure 7), even for larger observation ranges.

### Importance and Future Work

- Our algorithm is a necessary step towards fostering additional research into domain ownership changes.
- Alembic identifies potential changes in ownership without relying on archiving and parsing WHOIS records.
- We plan to improve and refine Alembic to account for multiple ownership changes and sparsity in the input DNS data.
- We propose investigating the relationship between the frequency of resolutions for a domain and the span of the observation window required to detect ownership changes.
- Finally, we plan to explore other detection signals to use as component scores.

### Additional Discoveries Using Alembic

#### Abuse of Positive Residual Trust

We used Alembic to identify abuses of both positive and negative residual trust. Here are some examples:

1. **Positive Residual Trust Abuse:**
   - **Example 1: doctorcompany.net**
     - After expiration, malware began using this domain for command and control (C&C).
     - Anti-virus analysis suggests this particular malware was a variant of Win32/Polif (a.k.a. Symmi), capable of downloading and executing arbitrary files, logging keystrokes, and exfiltrating stolen information.
     - Historic WHOIS data shows that doctorcompany.net changed owners once between 2008 and 2014.
     - The new owner used an identity protection service when registering the domain, a common tactic to exclude personal information from WHOIS records.
     - The domain became available for registration again on April 29, 2014, 81 days after the listed expiry date.
     - Malicious binaries attempted to query this domain about a month later on May 25, 2014.
     - The domain had approximately six years of history without abuse, allowing subsequent use by malware to benefit from its positive residual trust.

   - **Example 2: clicky.info**
     - This domain was also used for C&C only after domain expiration.
     - AV analysis suggests the malware sample is a variant of Win32/Nivdort, a trojan that steals key-presses, browsing history, credit card information, and user names and passwords.
     - Historic WHOIS data indicates the domain’s ownership changed eight times over eight years.
     - The domain was in pending delete status on February 11, 2014, and expired on February 13, 2014.
     - It was re-registered on March 9, 2014, and the first observed communication by malware to this domain occurred on March 15, 2014—less than a week after re-registration.
     - Malware using this domain leverages almost eight years of positive residual trust.

#### Abuse of Negative Residual Trust

- **Potential Attack Vector: Expired APT Domains**
  - On June 9, 2014, CrowdStrike released a report detailing the cyber espionage activities of PLA Unit 61486, also known as PUTTER PANDA.
  - The primary persona responsible for obtaining domains for Unit 61486’s C&C infrastructure was Chen Ping, identified by the registrant email cpyy.chen@gmail.com.
  - We identified us-reports.net, an expired domain previously registered using Chen Ping’s email.
  - We reanimated the domain, pointed it to a sinkhole, and found connection attempts every three seconds from a national government research lab in Taiwan.
  - This raises the question: Should domains be available for re-registration after they were previously used for malicious purposes?

### Discussion of Potential Remedies

#### Non-Technical Remedies

- While any domain may carry residual trust, the severity of potential abuse is greater for critical domains, such as those used by financial institutions or critical infrastructure.
- One potential remedy is to restrict critical industries to specially regulated zones, but this faces several challenges:
  - Criteria for identifying critical domains.
  - Identifying existing critical domains.
  - Migrating each domain from its existing zone.
  - Responsibility for creating and managing the critical zones.
- Another option is to have registrars or registries enforce special registration policies for critical domains, but this requires identifying and reporting all critical domains and assumes willing participation from registrars and registries.

#### Technical Remedies

- When non-technical remedies fail, technical solutions are needed to mitigate problems.
- Systems should employ processes like Alembic to identify potential ownership changes and revise inherent residual trust.
- For smaller numbers of domains, WHOIS can be used to identify when residual trust should be re-evaluated, but this does not scale well due to the complexities of bulk WHOIS collection.
- A system like Alembic can address these concerns by helping identify ownership changes and relying on underlying network properties.

### Conclusions

- Domains can change ownership for various reasons, and the remaining residual trust is abused by attackers to evade whitelists, hijack accounts, exploit software systems, or gain access to existing infections.
- Residual trust abuse is the root cause of many security issues on the Internet.
- Policy and technical remedies are needed to address this issue.
- Using a dataset of 179,326,265 expired domains from December 2008 to July 2015, we quantified and characterized residual trust abuse and malicious re-registration.
- We found that 385,741 expired domains were contacted by malware or appeared on a public blacklist, and the number of domains showing up on blacklists after expiration has grown, indicating that residual trust abuse is a growing phenomenon.
- To help the research community flag potentially dangerous reanimated domain names, we developed a lightweight algorithm, Alembic, to rank potential domain ownership changes using passively collected DNS features.
- We identified several cases of residual trust abuse, including instances where re-registered domain names were used as infrastructure to facilitate attacks and one instance where an expired APT-related domain name could have been re-registered to gain access to an overseas government research lab.
