### Time Stomping and Forensic Analysis

#### Introduction
For our guests from England, please allow me to provide a translation and explanation of the concept of time stomping in forensic analysis.

#### Background
Time stomping is a technique used to alter the timestamps of files to hide or obfuscate activities. This can be particularly relevant in forensic investigations, where the integrity of timestamps is crucial for reconstructing events.

#### Example File Timestamps
Below are some example file creation and last access times:

- **File 127**
  - Creation Date: 08/04/11 10:22:36
  - Last Accessed: 08/04/11 10:22:3

- **File 128**
  - Creation Date: 08/04/11 10:22:37
  - Last Accessed: 08/04/11 10:22:3

- **File 129**
  - Creation Date: 08/04/11 10:22:37
  - Last Accessed: 08/04/11 10:22:3

- **File 130**
  - Creation Date: 08/04/11 10:22:37

  - Creation Date: 08/04/11 10:22:42

  - Creation Date: 08/04/11 10:22:43
  - Last Accessed: 08/04/11 10:22:4

  - Creation Date: 08/04/11 10:22:45
  - Last Accessed: 08/04/11 10:22:4

- **File 138**
  - Creation Date: 08/04/11 10:22:46
  - Last Accessed: 09/06/06 08:00:0

- **File 139**
  - Creation Date: 08/04/11 10:22:47

  - Creation Date: 08/04/11 10:22:47
  - Last Accessed: 08/04/11 10:39:5

  - Creation Date: 08/04/11 10:22:48
  - Last Accessed: 08/04/11 10:22:4

#### Importance of Timestamps
Timestamps are critical in forensic analysis as they help in reconstructing the sequence of events. Changing the system clock to hide activities can introduce inconsistencies and leave a trail of evidence.

#### Tools and Techniques
- **timestomp.exe**: Demonstrated at BlackHat 2005, this tool modifies timestamps (Created, Accessed, Modified, MFT Entry) to deceive users.
- **AttributeMagic**: A more recent tool that also modifies timestamps but does not cover all possible artifacts.

#### NTFS Timestamps
NTFS file systems have eight timestamps associated with each file, stored in the Master File Table (MFT):

- **$STANDARD_INFORMATION** (Type: 0x10)
  - Created (0x00)
  - Last Modified (0x08)
  - MFT Entry Modified (0x10)
  - Last Accessed (0x18)

- **$FILE_NAME** (Type: 0x30)
  - Created (0x08)
  - Last Modified (0x10)
  - MFT Entry Modified (0x18)
  - Last Accessed (0x20)

These timestamps are read by forensic tools such as EnCase and FTK. Analyzing these requires additional effort, and many analysts need a reason to delve deeper.

#### Detection and Analysis
- **Obvious Timestomping**: Inconsistencies in timestamps, such as all entries being blank or matching the OS release date.
- **Windows Prefetch Files**: These files have eight timestamps and an embedded timestamp of the last executable run. If stealth is required, these timestamps must be modified or the file deleted.
- **Registry MRU Values**: Modified registry entries can also indicate timestomping. Data files, especially Office documents, often have shortcuts in the Windows Recent directory, which also store timestamps.

#### Granularity
- **NTFS Timestamps**: Stored in 64-bit values, providing accuracy down to 100 nanoseconds since January 1, 1601.
- **Timestomp.exe and AttributeMagic**: Only modify timestamps to the nearest second, making timestomping detectable unless an existing timestamp is copied.

#### Conclusion
It is nearly impossible to change all timestamps associated with running an executable without leaving traces. Effective detection requires a thorough understanding of the various timestamps and their interrelations.
