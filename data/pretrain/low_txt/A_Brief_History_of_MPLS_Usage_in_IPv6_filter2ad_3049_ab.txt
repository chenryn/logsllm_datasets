#### MPLS Raw Data
- **2009**: 5
- **2010**: 8
- **2011**: 13
- **2012**: 21
- **2013**: 25
- **2014**: 29
- **2015**: 29

#### IPv6 Traces Traversing MPLS Tunnels
- **2009**: 7,765
- **2010**: 2,128
- **2011**: 988
- **2012**: 4,009
- **2013**: 17,472
- **2014**: 3,550
- **2015**: 1,363

#### MPLS Tunnel Length Distribution (Ingress and Egress LER included)
- **Length 3-21**: Oscillates between 3 and 21.
- **Observation**: Tunnel length decreases over time, with longer tunnels in 2014 and shorter ones in 2015.

### Evaluation of MPLS Deployment under IPv6

#### Dataset
- **Source**: IPv6 Archipelago dataset [21].
- **Methodology**: ICMP-based ParisTraceroute measurements using scamper [23].
- **Frequency**: Probes all announced IPv6 prefixes (/48 or shorter) every 48 hours.
- **Data Collection**: January 1st, 2009 to August 1st, 2015.
- **IP2AS Mapping**: Team Cymru [1].

#### Observations
- **IPv6 Deployment**: Slow deployment from 2009 to 2013, followed by a rapid increase from 2014 to 2015.
- **MPLS Deployment**: Follows the same trend, with a peak in 2014 and 2015.
- **Focus Period**: January 1st, 2014 to August 1st, 2015 (20 measurement cycles).

### MPLS Deployment in IPv6

#### Basic Statistics
- **Figure 2**: Raw number of traceroutes traversing at least one MPLS tunnel.
  - **Trend**: The number of traces increases over time, but the number of traces involved in MPLS tunnels remains stable.
  - **Comparison**: 7-8% of IPv6 traceroutes traverse MPLS tunnels, compared to at least 40% for IPv4.
  - **Drop in 2015**: Due to fewer active vantage points.

- **Figure 3**: Tunnel length distribution for four measurement snapshots.
  - **Observation**: Tunnel length oscillates between 3 and 21, with a decreasing trend over time.
  - **Impact**: Disappearance of AS174 (Cogent) around October 2014, which used long tunnels.

### Label Stack Size Distribution

#### Methodology
- **LSR Label Count**: For each LSR in a tunnel, count the number of labels and map to the maximum number of labels.
- **Usage Inference**: Short tunnels with specific label sequences are mapped to their likely usage (e.g., 1,2,1 for VPN purposes).

#### Observations
- **Figure 4**: LSE size distribution over time.
  - **IPv4**: Majority (80%) of tunnels have a single LSE.
  - **IPv6**: Majority (80%) of tunnels have at least two labels, indicating more extensive use of VPNs.

- **Figure 5**: Bottom stack LSE value distribution in IPv6.
  - **Shift**: Around October 2014, most tunnels (80%) use a bottom label of 2, suggesting 6PE usage.
  - **Match with IPv4**: Over 40% of tunnels with a bottom label of 2 match IPv4 LSPs, reinforcing 6PE usage.

- **Figure 6**: 6PE core architecture.
  - **Observation**: Tiny proportion of 6PE tunnels map IPv4 addresses to IPv6, indicating dual-stack LSRs without public IPv6 addresses.
  - **Common Case**: Most 6PE tunnels have an IPv6 core with public IPv6 addresses, using LDPv4 for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.

### Cogent Case Study

- **Prominent Position**: One of the largest Tier-1 ASes.
- **Behavior Change**: Around October 2014, Cogent's MPLS traces almost disappear, and the proportion of stacks with a bottom label of 2 rises sharply.
- **Possible Explanations**:
  - **Configuration Change**: Routers no longer propagate TTL.
  - **MPLS Removal**: Operator may have removed MPLS.
- **Tests Conducted**: To determine if Cogent removed ttl-propagate at Ingress LERs, as observed in IPv4 MPLS (Vanaubel et al. [7]).

This structured and detailed analysis provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the MPLS deployment and behavior in IPv6 networks, highlighting key trends and specific cases like Cogent.
