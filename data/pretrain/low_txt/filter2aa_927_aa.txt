3. Threat Actor's Digital Arsenal
4. Conclusion

### Critical Incidents in Taiwan's Supply Chain/Critical Infrastructure
- **ASUS Supply Chain Attack**
- **TSMC Ransomware**
- **ColdLock against CPC**

### Taiwan's Importance in the Semiconductor Landscape
Taiwan has established itself as a leading player in the semiconductor industry, with companies like TSMC and MTK. According to Taiwan News (July 2019), Taiwan is set to become the largest and fastest-growing semiconductor equipment maker, with a 21.1% increase to reach US$12.31 billion.

### Cyberattacks on Semiconductor Vendors
- **Impact:**
  - Seriously impact Taiwan’s economy
  - Affect the entire global supply chain
- **Types of Attacks:**
  - **OT Attack:** Production line halt, immediate damage
  - **IT Attack:** Leak important intellectual property, long-term damage

### Large-scale APT Attacks on the Semiconductor Industry
- **Time Frame:** 2018-2019
- **Targets:** Vendors located in the Hsinchu Science Park (HSP)
- **Scope:** More than 7 vendors were targeted by the same threat actor
- **Nature of Attack:** Precise and well-coordinated, targeting not just the vendors but also their subsidiaries and competitors
- **Industry Impact:** Not a single-point attack, but an attack on the entire industry surface

### Group Chimera
- **Attribution:** Similar activities, attack techniques, and tactics suggest a single threat actor
- **Target:** Semiconductor Vendors
- **Malware:**
  - Merged different open-source tools (Dumpert, Mimikatz, CobaltStrike)
- **C2 Infrastructure:**
  - Hosted in public clouds (Google App Engine, Azure)
- **Goal:** Steal documents, source code, and SDKs of chip-related projects

### Investigation Overview
- **Period:** 2018-2019
- **Vendors Investigated:** 3+
- **Endpoints Analyzed:** 30,000

### Today's Case Study

- **Insights:**
  - Detailed monitoring revealed attacker activities
  - Tracked root cause effectively

#### B Company
- **Service:** One-time IR
- **Insights:**
  - Highlighted long-term activities and data leaks
  - Investigation started long after the attacks

#### C Company
- **Relationship:** Long-term partner with high security capacity
- **Insights:**
  - Deep investigation and valuable feedback
  - Provided more information on threat actors

### Non-representative Data
- All machine names and usernames in the following slides are de-identified and not original.

### A Company: Case Overview
- **Activity Date:** 2019/12/09 - 2019/12/10
- **Compromised:**
  - 15 endpoints
  - 6 user accounts
- **Malware and C2 Servers:**
  - Four malwares
  - Eight C2 servers

#### Cobalt Strike
- **Disguise:** Google Update.exe
- **Detection:** No hits on VirusTotal
- **Execution:** Injected payloads into other processes
- **Endpoints:** Server-LAUREN & PC-SHENNA

#### C2 Hosting
- **Detection Difficulty:** Network security devices had trouble detecting C2 servers hosted on Google Cloud Platform
- **Backdoor:** Disguised as Google Update
- **Other Cloud Services:** Also abused for hosting

#### Root Cause Analysis - PC-SHENNA
- **Timeline Analysis:**
  - Backdoor implanted from Server-LAUREN
  - Attack launched right before employees left work

#### Remote Execution Tools
- **Schtasks:**
  - First Cobalt Strike backdoor located at NB-CLAIR, then copied to Server-LAUREN
  - Valid account used to invoke Cobalt Strike via schtasks
- **WMIC:**
  - Used to check internet connection on another endpoint

#### Root Cause Analysis - Server-LAUREN
- **New Findings:**
  - Additional information added to the investigation graph
  - Server-LAUREN used archive tool to collect registry and ntds.dit from Server-MELINA (DC) for offline breaking

#### NTDS.DIT Explanation
- **Active Directory Data:**
  - Stored in ntds.dit ESE database file
  - Two copies present in separate locations
    - `%SystemRoot%\NTDS\ntds.dit`
    - `%SystemRoot%\System32\ntds.dit`
- **Content:**
  - Domain hosts and users' information (ID, name, email, password)
  - Encrypted, key stored in SYSTEM registry
  - Adversary needed to copy both ntds.dit and registry data

#### Root Cause Analysis - NB-CLAIR
- **AI Investigation:**
  - NB-CLAIR used Schedule Task to place malware in Server-LAUREN
- **Timeline:**
  - Six minutes before scheduled task execution, IP1 used RDP and User-01 to log in
  - Likely root cause of the attack

#### Reconnaissance
- **Commands:**
  - "net user" commands executed for recon
  - Results saved in RecordedTV_lib.log

#### Data Exfiltration
- **Tool:**
  - RECORDEDTV.MS used to archive stolen data
- **Binaries:**
  - Found in several machines under different names (e.g., RECORDEDTV.MS, uncheck.dmp, jucheck.exe)
