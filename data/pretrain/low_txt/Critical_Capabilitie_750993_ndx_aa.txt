#### Initiatives
Application performance monitoring (APM) and observability tools provide visibility into the digital experience, optimizing user engagement. These tools now include security features, and OpenTelemetry is emerging as a new standard. With a wide array of tools available, IT and operations (I&O) leaders must identify the critical capabilities that best meet their needs.

#### Overview
- **Key Findings:**
  - The demand for online channels continues to grow, even as the pandemic slows. Interest in APM and observability tools remains high, with ongoing innovation in the market.
  - Increased security breaches have led some APM and observability vendors to add security capabilities, often in the form of runtime application self-protection (RASP).
  - The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)-curated OpenTelemetry distributed tracing standard is nearing completion and is gaining widespread support. The third element, logs, is expected by the end of 2022, completing the first version. Many vendors in this research are already implementing OpenTelemetry.

- **Recommendations:**
  - I&O leaders should choose an APM and observability solution that includes use cases and personas outside of IT operations, such as DevOps, site reliability engineering (SRE), and security operations. This encourages collaboration, maximizes tool value, and broadens the target audience.
  - Maximize future flexibility by requiring support for OpenTelemetry and other standards in the APM and observability product selection process. Even if not adopting OpenTelemetry immediately, it is becoming increasingly common for collecting performance data from external services.
  - Align requirements, use cases, and relevance to appropriate personas and the best-fit tool options using this research, combined with Gartner’s Cool Vendors research, to examine the rapidly shifting APM market.

#### What You Need to Know
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM) and Observability:**
  - APM and observability software enables the observation and analysis of application health, performance, and user experience (UX). It is widely used by IT operations, SREs, cloud and platform operations, application developers, and product owners.
  - Key functional requirements include:
    - Observation of an application’s complete transactional behavior
    - Automated discovery and mapping of application and infrastructure dependencies (including cloud services)
    - Monitoring of applications running on mobile devices and desktop browsers
    - Identification and analysis of application performance problems and their impact on business outcomes
    - Native integration with automation and service management tools, as well as public cloud providers (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Operations)
    - Analysis of business key performance indicators (KPIs) and user journeys
    - Interactive interrogation of multiple telemetry types (traces, metrics, and logs) to detect “unknown unknowns”
    - Application security functionality, often delivered via a common agent or framework

- **Critical Capabilities and Use Cases:**
  - Gartner has established six critical capabilities across six use cases that differentiate popular tools in this market:
    - **Critical Capabilities:**
      - Application debugging and distributed profiling (ADDP)
      - Behavior analysis
      - Business analysis

      - Root cause analysis (RCA)
      - Runtime application self-protection (RASP)
    - **Use Cases:**
      - Application owner/line of business (LOB)
      - DevOps/AppDev
      - Digital experience monitoring (DEM)
