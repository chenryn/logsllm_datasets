### Cloud Services and Malicious Infrastructure

Cybercriminals often utilize cloud services to host parts of their malicious infrastructure, including exploit servers for distributing malware and Command and Control (C&C) servers for managing infected terminals. Our research complements existing studies by analyzing the factors that influence attackers in choosing specific hosting providers.

### Detection of Botnet Infrastructure

A second area of research focuses on developing methods to better detect botnet infrastructure. For example, Cyberprobe [30] describes an active probing approach for detecting malicious servers and compromised hosts. ASwatch [22] aims to detect and identify malicious Autonomous Systems (ASes) that exhibit "agile" control plane behavior, such as short-lived routes and aggressive rewiring. Fast flux is another technique used by cybercriminals, which leverages compromised computers to provide scalability, geographic diversity, anonymity, and redundancy. This fast flux infrastructure relies on computing resources stolen from unwitting users of infected endpoints. Cybercriminals rent these fast flux proxy networks to create a profitable black market hosting environment. The authors of [8, 44] have analyzed the structural relationships (domain, nameserver, IP connectivity) of fast-flux botnets and identified recurrent structural clusters across different botnet types. In [8], the authors used a social network connectivity metric to show that C&C and phishing, as well as malware and spam botnets, have similar structural scores using the proposed metric. In this paper, we define metrics to capture not only attacker behavior but also the efforts of hosting providers in mitigating the malicious infrastructure within their networks.

### Reputation Systems for Providers

A third strand of research involves the development of reputation systems for providers, particularly those that facilitate cybercrime [23, 31, 35]. For instance, FIRE [35] introduced a ranking system based on the uptime of botnet hosting services to identify and expose providers with persistent, malicious behavior. In [31], the authors propose various reputation metrics based on the concentration of abuse, taking into account some structural characteristics of hosting providers. In our explanatory analysis, we use the structural properties of hosting providers to assess the impact of these on their security performance.

### Analysis and Findings

These approaches help to identify and enumerate botnet C&C infrastructure and describe its distribution across networks and countries. We extend this related work through explanatory analysis to determine the driving factors for the locations of the C&C infrastructure in the hosting market. We statistically model and explain the distribution of C&C from the structural properties of hosting providers, business models, and factors like the rule of law. We expand on the work by Gañán et al. [15] by studying the properties of providers hosting C&C domains.

Hosting providers play a key role in the size and spread of these botnets. Various abuse reporting strategies have been proposed and evaluated to analyze the performance of hosting providers [11, 19, 29]. However, as shown by Canali et al. [10], many hosting providers do not take appropriate measures, likely due to a lack of incentives. Millions of websites are often poorly managed by inexperienced users, and shared web hosting providers have not developed reliable mechanisms to keep their users safe. With the emergence of cloud providers, attackers have a new platform to host their infrastructure. Current studies have shown that these types of providers are being used to launch long-tail spam campaigns due to their low cost [25, 36]. Only a few specific providers have attempted to create added value by providing "add-on" security services. For instance, a Dutch web hosting provider [13] has added a free automated website vulnerability scanning, fixing, and recovery service.

On the other end of the spectrum, there are hosting providers acting as cybercrime facilitators [22, 40, 41]. Researchers and law enforcement agencies are searching for better ways to shut down these providers. While these efforts are critical for the overall fight against cybercrime, our analysis suggests that the C&C of botnets engaged in attacks on financial services do not depend on malicious hosting providers, nor do attackers seem to prefer these providers when locating their C&C.

### Conclusions and Future Work

Over the years, hosting providers have made significant efforts to take down C&C infrastructure for botnets engaged in attacks on financial services. This paper aimed to shed light on the strategies of attackers using these botnets for the placement of their C&C servers across the hosting market. Specifically, we examined whether attackers show a preference for providers with lax security efforts or if the placement choice of C&C domains is randomly distributed across the hosting space, as measured via the provider’s structural properties.

We studied seven years of C&C data for 26 botnet families engaged in attacks on financial services and demonstrated a general increase in the total number of providers hosting C&C domains over time. We also found a dynamic pattern of providers entering and exiting the population of providers that host financial malware C&C.

Our results show that C&C abuse is highly concentrated in a small number of providers. This concentration can be explained by the relatively large portion of the overall attack surface that these providers represent in the hosting market.

To study the effect of hosting provider characteristics on C&C concentrations, we modeled the distribution of C&Cs using Generalized Linear Models (GLM), with C&C counts following a Poisson distribution. We showed that a provider’s attack surface characteristics, such as IP and domain space size and the proportion of shared hosting, can explain around 71% of the variance in the number of C&Cs per provider. The rule of law in a country only explains an additional 1% of the variance, suggesting that attackers do not prefer providers in jurisdictions with weak law enforcement. Overall, the selection process for C&C seems to be random: the probability of hosting C&C is highly proportional to the attack surface of the providers, as measured by indicators of the size of the provider.

Additionally, business model characteristics of providers show a significant relation with C&C concentrations. While the pricing of a hosting plan negatively affects C&C concentrations, provider popularity, time in business, and the ratio of vulnerable software have a significant positive relation with C&C concentrations. Despite statistically significant differences in C&C takedown speeds among providers, when modeled in conjunction with attack surface variables, takedown speed shows only a very weak relation with the concentration of C&Cs across providers, suggesting that attackers are largely impervious to the takedown efforts of hosting providers.

On a more general level, our results suggest that the amount of C&C abuse in a provider's network is a function of the provider’s structural properties, such as its size and pricing strategy, rather than the effort they put into abuse handling.

Our approach helps in developing evidence-based policies in the hosting market. We demonstrate an approach that enables better comparative abuse metrics by controlling for the structural differences among providers, rather than relying on absolute counts.

### Limitations and Future Work

Our work comes with several limitations. The dataset contains only malware families that have been used to attack financial institutions. Some are predominantly used for this purpose, like Citadel, but others are more generic malware families. Although our methodology is generalizable, it remains an open question whether the patterns we found differ for different kinds of abuse data. Future work could explore this.

Additionally, our uptime analysis can contain biases from unknown measurement errors in the first-seen and last-seen observations of C&C domains. Such observations are known to be quite noisy. However, we believe that the effects would be negligible since any biases would be systematic. Finally, because we have used pooled data for the entire measurement period, our models do not account for changes in C&C counts over time. Future work can look into whether these patterns change over time.
