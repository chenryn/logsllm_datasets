# Achieving Meaningful Privacy in Digital Systems

**Author: Helen Nissenbaum**

## Abstract
Across various subfields, computer scientists and engineers have responded to societal calls for privacy protection through technological innovation, leading to significant scientific progress. As the fields of privacy science and engineering mature, it is essential to reflect on the underlying conceptions of privacy that guide this work. Specifically, we must ask whether these conceptions are meaningful—whether they align with the societal concerns that initially sparked the need for privacy safeguards. If not, the true purpose and value of these scientific efforts become unclear.

In my lecture, I argue that the concept of Contextual Integrity (CI) provides a meaningful framework for privacy. CI is both philosophically sound and amenable to formal representation, making it a vital bridge between technical, ethical, and policy approaches to privacy. I will also highlight promising directions for future work, drawing on existing technical applications of CI.

## Biography
Helen Nissenbaum is a professor of information science at Cornell Tech, where she serves as the founding director of the Digital Life Initiative. This initiative focuses on ethics, politics, and quality of life in digital societies. Her notable books include *Obfuscation: A User's Guide for Privacy and Protest* (co-authored with F. Brunton, 2015), *Values at Play in Digital Games* (co-authored with M. Flanagan, 2014), and *Privacy in Context: Technology, Policy, and the Integrity of Social Life* (2010).

Nissenbaum has contributed to the development of privacy-enhancing software, such as TrackMeNot and AdNauseam. She has received grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, MacArthur Foundation, and others, often in collaboration with colleagues in computer science and engineering. She holds a Ph.D. in philosophy from Stanford University and a B.A. (Honors) in mathematics and philosophy from the University of Witwatersrand.
