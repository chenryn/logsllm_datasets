### Browser Fingerprinting and Mitigation Strategies

Browser fingerprinting is a technique used to track web users by collecting and analyzing unique characteristics of their web browsers. Several modern browsers and add-ons have implemented features to mitigate this issue. For example, the Brave Browser offers a fingerprinting protection mode, while Firefox provides Tracking Protection in its private browsing mode. Additionally, browser extensions like Canvas Defender add noise to fingerprinting data, making it more difficult for trackers to obtain an accurate fingerprint.

The research community has also developed various anti-fingerprinting solutions. PriVaricator, for instance, introduces randomized noise into fingerprinting results, thereby preventing trackers from obtaining precise fingerprints. Another solution, the Deterministic Browser, similar to the Tor Browser, focuses on defending against timing-based fingerprinting. Recently, the W3C has introduced a new group note with several recommended practices for browser vendors to mitigate browser fingerprinting.

### Conclusion

Browser fingerprints are dynamic and evolve over time as users update their browsers and operating systems or interact with different websites. This dynamism can introduce inaccuracies in existing fingerprinting tools designed to track web users. In this paper, we conducted the first large-scale measurement study on the dynamics of browser fingerprints. We deployed a customized fingerprinting tool on a real-world website and collected millions of data points over an eight-month period. The raw data was then processed to generate a dataset representing browser instances using a combination of anonymized usernames and stable browser features.

Our results indicate that fingerprint dynamics can be categorized into three main types based on their root causes: browser or OS updates, user actions, and environmental changes. Our study provides several new insights:
1. Fingerprint dynamics can leak security- or privacy-related information.
2. Prior evolution-aware fingerprinting tools, such as FP-Stalker, perform poorly in large-scale, real-world settings.
3. Some unrelated fingerprint features may be correlated in specific dynamics.
4. Fingerprinting dynamics can be linked to real-world events like browser or OS updates.

We also offer recommendations for browser vendors and users to enhance security and privacy, as well as for developers of evolution-aware fingerprinting tools to improve linking accuracy and speed.

### Future Work

In the future, we plan to investigate the trade-off between the uniqueness and linkability of browser fingerprints using our large-scale dataset. We aim to design a better fingerprinting tool that balances these two critical metrics, as uniqueness determines the extent to which a tool can track a browser instance, and linkability determines how long the tool can maintain tracking.
