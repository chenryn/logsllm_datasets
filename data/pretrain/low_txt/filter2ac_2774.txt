**ATT&CK ID:** T1574.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** DLL Search Order Hijacking

Adversaries may execute malicious payloads by exploiting the DLL search order used to load dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into a program. On Windows systems, a standard method is employed to locate and load the required DLLs. By hijacking this search order, attackers can inject their own malicious code, enabling them to establish persistence, elevate privileges, or evade restrictions on file execution.
