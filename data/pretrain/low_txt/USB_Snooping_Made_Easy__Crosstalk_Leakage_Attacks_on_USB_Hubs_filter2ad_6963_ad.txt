### Figure 22: Analog Front-End and ADC Accuracy for Typing Speeds from 150 KPM to 210 KPM
This figure illustrates the accuracy rate of the analog front-end and ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) for typing speeds ranging from 150 KPM (Keypresses Per Minute) to 210 KPM. It is worth noting that the average adult typing speed is between 36 and 45 words per minute, which is equivalent to approximately 200 KPM. [5]

### Figure 23: Demonstration of Our Attack
In this demonstration, we typed "USB CROSSTALK" on a keyboard connected to a Surface Pro device. Simultaneously, our spy probe monitored the data line crosstalk leakage, exfiltrating the key presses via Bluetooth to the attacker's computer.

### 7. Conclusions
In this paper, we present two attacks on the USB bus, which expose upstream traffic previously considered secure against off-path adversaries. These attacks exploit the electrical properties of USB hubs, affecting both internal and external hubs. Traditional countermeasures, such as blocking the power or data lines, do not protect against our attack. We now discuss potential countermeasures.

#### Hardware Countermeasures
One possible solution to completely eliminate crosstalk leakage is to optically decouple the USB data lines and construct a dedicated 5V supply for each downstream port. However, such solutions are expensive and require careful design. A more cost-effective countermeasure involves using an LC low-pass filter and LDO (Low Dropout Regulator) to decouple the USB power lines from the data lines. Figure 25 presents an improved USB condom that, in addition to disconnecting the USB data lines, also attempts to suppress any signal above 300Hz. As shown in Figure 26, our improved USB condom significantly reduces the data line crosstalk leakage, requiring far more sensitive measurement equipment to exploit the remaining small leakage.

Frequency filtering cannot be used to protect the data lines against crosstalk leakage because the leaked signal carries the same basic frequencies as the original signal. Therefore, any frequency-based filtering that removes the leakage frequencies will also remove the signal frequencies. The design of hardware countermeasures to data line leakage remains an open problem for future work.

#### Software Countermeasures
The lack of encryption in the USB protocol is a major design limitation. Without encryption, the protocol cannot guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of messages. Adding end-to-end encryption, for example, using the methodology of [7], would protect messages from eavesdropping attacks such as those described in this work. Simpler approaches, such as encryption with a session key generated using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol [20], could also mitigate our attack. Both approaches require devices to have sufficient computational power to perform public key operations.

#### Future Work
Our spy probe implementation uses commercial off-the-shelf components, which are not optimized for capturing USB traffic. This results in a relatively large size and high power consumption. Designing dedicated hardware could lead to a smaller, more inconspicuous implementation that can be embedded within the USB plug [40].

While our attack applies to non-USB 3.0 devices connected to USB 3.0 hubs (see Figure 4(d)), it does not apply to USB 3.0 devices connected to USB 3.0 hubs. This is because USB 3.0 devices use three differential wire pairs and employ a much higher transmission rate, which exceeds the specifications of our measurement equipment. Although more challenging to attack, USB 3.0 devices present a lucrative target, as downstream communication, like upstream communication, is unicasted from the host to the device. Exploiting crosstalk effects on such configurations would expose downstream traffic to off-path attackers. Since input devices, which often send sensitive information to the host, mostly use USB 1.x, our attack remains relevant despite not applying to the newest version of the protocol (USB 3.0).

Further research is required to determine if other buses and communication networks are vulnerable to crosstalk attacks.
