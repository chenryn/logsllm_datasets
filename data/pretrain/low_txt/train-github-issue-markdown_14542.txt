# Environment
- **Windows Build Number:** 1909 (18363.836)
- **PowerToys Version:** 0.18.2
- **PowerToy Module:** PowerToys Run

# Steps to Reproduce
1. Press `Alt + Space` to open PowerToys Run.
2. Search for "Bildschirmtastatur" or "winver".

# Expected Behavior
- Searching for "Bildschirmtastatur" should bring up the on-screen keyboard.
- Searching for "winver" should bring up the Windows version dialogue.

# Actual Behavior
- "Bildschirmtastatur" cannot be found in PowerToys Run. It can only be found via the Start menu.
- However, if the application is already running and was started via the Start menu, it can be found in PowerToys Run (see second screenshot).
- "winver" can only be started from the Start menu. Typing "winver" in PowerToys Run only brings up system administrative tools.
