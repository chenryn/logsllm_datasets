### Improved Text

#### Main Content
The procurement, insurance, and peering requirements have lacked the necessary measurement capabilities. Our project has addressed this gap by validating the use of a platform that can store and utilize measurements to evaluate the long-term effects of any deployed interventions. More broadly, this initiative underscores the critical role of measurement—encompassing science, infrastructure, and data management—in developing and implementing practical solutions to the Internet's essential security vulnerabilities.

#### Private Notification
The Spoofer system automatically generated emails for individual Autonomous Systems (ASes) using the following general format. The system tailored the details of the notification to the AS using the evidence it had available. For example, it included a secret key in the URL so that the contact could view results of inbound spoofing tests. We manually sent each email to the abuse or other technical contact using the real name and contact address of a representative of the project.

**From:** Matthew Luckie  
**To:** [Contact Email]  
**Subject:** Source IP Address Spoofing from [AS Name]

While reviewing recent public tests from the CAIDA spoofer client (<https://www.caida.org/projects/spoofer/>), we came across one involving [AS Name]. Based on the testing history for AS [AS Number], there is inadequate filtering of IPv6 packets with invalid source addresses, allowing packets with spoofed IPv6 source addresses to leave your network. These systems can participate in volumetric denial of service attacks. However, it seems that packets with spoofed source IPv4 addresses are correctly being filtered. Additionally, packets with spoofed source addresses claiming to be from inside your network are not filtered when they arrive from outside your network.

For more information, please visit:
- <https://spoofer.caida.org/recent_tests.php?as_include=[AS Number]>
- <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2827.txt>

#### Public Region-Focused Notification
The Spoofer system automatically generated region-focused emails and sent them using a role account to network operator group mailing lists, using the following general format. The system sorted the ASes in the improvements table by the date it inferred remediation to take place, and sorted ASes in the issues table by the date it first observed spoofed packets. We used translations for the report in French, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish.

**From:** CAIDA Spoofer Project  
**To:** [Mailing List]  
**Subject:** CAIDA Spoofer Report for [Region] for [Month, Year]

In response to feedback from operational security communities, CAIDA’s source address validation measurement project (<https://spoofer.caida.org>) is automatically generating monthly reports of ASes originating prefixes in BGP for systems from which we received packets with a spoofed source address. We are publishing these reports to network and security operations lists to ensure this information reaches operational contacts in these ASes.
