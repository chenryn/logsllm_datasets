#### History of Vulnerability Disclosure and Bug Bounty Programs

**Vulnerability Disclosure vs. Bug Bounty Programs**

- **Vulnerability Disclosure**: Ensures organizations are ready to handle vulnerability reports. Follows ISO standards (ISO 29147 and ISO 30111). 
- **Bug Bounty Programs**: Some organizations and governments offer cash rewards for reported bugs. Some manage these programs internally (e.g., Microsoft), while others use service providers.

**Bug Bounties can work in large and small organizations, with some preparation and support.**

**Bug Bounty vs. Penetration Testing and Bug Bounty Service Providers**

- **BugCrowd**: Great for triage support.
- **HackerOne**: Ideal for automation if you have the internal talent.
- **Synack**: Suitable for crowd-sourced penetration testing under NDA.

**From Microsoft to the Pentagon: From "No Way!" to "Ok, for Pay!"**

- **Microsoft’s Strategic Bounty Programs**:
  - $100,000 for new techniques
  - $50,000 for new defenses
  - $11,000 for IE11 beta bugs

**Marketplace Gap: When Defense is the Only Game in Town**

- **Actual Results**: 18 serious security holes identified during the IE11 beta bounty program.

**Bounty Market Timing Tricks**

- **Hack the Pentagon – Hack the Planet!**
- **Hack the Army – Hack the Planet!**

**Avoid These Pitfalls in Planning Bounties and Marathons**

- "Failing to plan is planning to fail."
- "Don’t reinvent the wheel, just realign it."

**Rushing into a bug bounty without preparation is like running a marathon immediately following a coma.**

**With Great Regulation Comes Great Responsibility**

- **Policy**: Not pronounced "police-y"
- **Role**: Advising lawmakers, regulators, and governments

**Wassenaar Arrangement: Intent vs. Result**

- **Intent**: Regulate surveillance software to prevent its sale to repressive regimes.
- **Result**: Caught all kinds of software and technology, impacting the internet's ability to defend itself.
