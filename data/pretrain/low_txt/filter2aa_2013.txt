# Church of WiFi: Wireless Extravaganza

## Today’s Participants
- Thorn
- theprez98
- Renderman

## Who Are The Church of WiFi (CoWF)?
**Q: Pirates? Ninjas? Pirates with stealthy Ninja skills? Ninjas who say "Arrgh"?**
- **A1:** A “Church” where they practice “WiFi Voodoo.”
- **A2:** A group of individuals who wear Pope hats and are passionate about wireless technology.

## The Problem
- **Lack of Skills:** 
  - Nunchuck skills, bowhunting skills, computer hacking skills—girls only want boyfriends with great skills.

## The Idea
- **Learn + Touch = DO!**
  - “I care about demonstrating and inciting 'hacker attitude' toward my fellow attendees...” – c0nverge

## The Concept
- **Hands-on Learning:**
  - Inspired by the Lockpick Village and LosT’s informal breakout sessions.
  - Provide an area for wireless tutorials, mini-presentations, and breakout sessions.
  - Act as an introduction to various wireless contests.

## The Solution: Skybox 209
- **Wireless Village: Breakouts**
  - **Breakout Sessions:**
    - PSP Wireless Hacking (Squidly1)
    - RF Direction Finding (Renderman)
    - RFID (Thorn)
    - WEP Cracking, WPA Cracking, and more.
  - **Open Environment for Learning:**
    - Contests and tutorials for all skill levels, from beginner to expert.
    - Mini-presentations and demonstrations for hands-on learning.

## DC Wireless Contests
- **Integrated into the Village:**
  - Allows participants to learn a skill at the village and then compete.

## WPA-PSK “Rainbow Tables”
- **Time vs. Computing Power Tradeoff:**
  - 2006: 172,000-word dictionary x 1,000 most common SSIDs = 7GB tables.
  - 2023: 1,000,000-password dictionary x 1,000 most common SSIDs = 35GB tables.

## CoWF “Distro”
- **USB-Bootable Full-Linux Distro:**
  - Based on BackTrack 2, installed on a 100GB+ 3.5” HD.
  - Bootable on any laptop/PC for running wireless security checks.
  - Integrated with CoWPAtty and CoWF WPA/WPA2 Rainbow tables.
  - 100GB+ storage for additional tools and tables.

## Shameless Self Promotion
- **Check out:**
  - Wireless Village in Skybox 209
  - Wireless Contests
  - “The Church of WiFi presents...Hacking Iraq” (8 PM tomorrow in Area 1)
  - I'm looking for a job, consider hiring me ;-)

## Render’s Rant
- **Key Points:**
  - Hack because you should, not just for money.
  - Community needs more interaction.
  - Companies should allow more developer collaboration.
  - Moving away from the 'Evil' look.
  - Easier navigation and maintenance.
  - Non-denominational, equally offensive to all.

## The CoWF Confessional
- **Concept:**
  - Share wireless sins/errors to help others learn.
  - Moderated for anonymity and safety.
  - Examples: CORE USB pwnage, Bluetooth issues.

## Bluetooth
- **Not Just Wi-Fi:**
  - Many BT peripherals and hardware hacks.
  - Bluetooth Glove, Banana, and Brick Phone.
  - The Blueshoe (BT Headset + Shoe).

## Larger Bluetooth Issues
- **Security Concerns:**
  - Every BT headset is a potential listening device.
  - Lack of tools for full research and monitoring.
  - Need for open-source applications and cheap RAW devices.

## WIFI Mischief
- **Research and Attacks:**
  - WEP is not dead for research.
  - Attack the attack tools.
  - Michael and the IEEE saga.
  - Aircrack-ptw and statistical analysis.
  - Legacy hardware and design concessions.
  - QoS breaks sequence enforcement.
  - Client attacks and countermeasures.

## Conclusion
- **Visit the Wireless Village:**
  - Contribute projects, ask questions, and donate.
  - Learn + Touch = DO!
  - Share the knowledge and keep on hacking the air.
  - Give Render & theprez98 jobs!
