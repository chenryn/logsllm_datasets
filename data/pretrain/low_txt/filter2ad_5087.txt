**Keynote Talk: Modeling the Internet is Fun! But Can You Make a Living?**

**Speaker: Don Towsley**
- **Affiliation:** Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts
- **Location:** Amherst, MA 01003

**Abstract:**
This keynote talk provides an overview of significant achievements and success stories in the mathematical modeling and analysis of the Internet and other networks. The presentation will begin with a discussion of Kleinrock's groundbreaking work on store-and-forward network modeling and its subsequent extensions, and conclude with the development of fluid models for the current Internet. The talk will also highlight key lessons learned from these efforts and explore how modeling and analysis can contribute to the design and performance of new network technologies, such as wireless and application-level networks. Finally, the speaker will address the question of whether one can both enjoy the process of modeling networks and make a living from it.
