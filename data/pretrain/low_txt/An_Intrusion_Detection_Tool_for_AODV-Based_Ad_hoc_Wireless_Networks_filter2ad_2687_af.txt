### Inherent Vulnerabilities and Security in MANETs

In this study, we explore the inherent vulnerabilities of mobile devices in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) and discuss several potential attacks on such devices. We review related work in this area and present the design and implementation of our secure routing protocol, SecAODV, along with an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The IDS is designed to be independent of the routing protocol, although in this case, we have used SecAODV for routing. The primary role of the routing protocols is to create and maintain routes. Even with protections against routing disruption attacks, packet mangling attacks, and grey hole attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that exploit MAC layer vulnerabilities to disrupt communication remain a concern. Such attacks cannot be prevented at higher networking layers; instead, security mechanisms must be integrated into the MAC protocol itself.

### Collaborative IDS and Signal Strength Analysis

While nodes can operate independently, a platform for collaboration is necessary to disseminate information about misbehaving nodes. The scope of a host-based IDS deployed on a mobile device is limited to its radio range. To address this, we are currently developing a collaborative IDS that will provide a collective response to misbehaving or intrusive nodes. In addition to using thresholds, we are also exploring the use of signal strengths from neighboring nodes to detect misbehavior. This approach helps differentiate between a node that is dropping packets and one that has simply moved out of range. A low signal strength can help determine the distance of the neighboring node, aiding in the detection of misbehavior and improving the scalability and accuracy of the IDS. 

### Energy Consumption and Performance Considerations

We are also investigating the additional energy consumption requirements associated with using secure routing protocols like SecAODV. The larger header sizes in routing messages can increase overhead, affecting throughput and response times. We are exploring ways to mitigate these effects and improve overall performance.
