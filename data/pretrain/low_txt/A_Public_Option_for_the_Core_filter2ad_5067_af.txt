### Neutrality Focus and Termination Fees

Our focus is on termination fees, which we consider the most fundamental violation of network neutrality. In contrast, offering different qualities of service (QoS) on an open basis with transparent pricing is a distinct issue that we do not address. We take no stance against QoS, as it does not limit future design choices but rather addresses specific revenue mechanisms.

### Ex Ante Regulation Concerns

There are concerns that ex ante network neutrality regulation (i.e., regulations imposed before significant violations occur) might interfere with the Internet's evolution. However, since we do not oppose QoS, we are not constraining future design options. Furthermore, once termination fees are implemented, they are difficult to reverse, making ex ante regulation necessary.

### Last Mile Provider Profit Sharing

It has been argued that last mile providers need to share in the profits of content providers via termination fees to maintain adequate bandwidth. This argument, however, overlooks two key points:
1. Termination fees can be applied even when there is no bandwidth need, making them an ill-suited solution for incentivizing bandwidth expansion.
2. Even under network neutrality, last mile providers can charge consumers based on traffic volume. Recent research [40] shows that better pricing policies by last mile providers can significantly improve broadband network usage.

### Modeling Differences

We differ from existing literature in two significant ways:
1. We do not model competition between Content Service Providers (CSPs) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs), unlike some studies [6].
2. We model the CSP-ISP interaction as a Nash bargaining problem rather than a non-cooperative game with a Nash equilibrium, which is the dominant approach. The closest paper to our approach is [1], but in that work, bargaining power was given exogenously, whereas here it is derived from the nature of the disagreement point.

### Are We Crazy?

#### Is Major Change Needed?

The issues we address stem from a single cause: the Internet was not designed with a business model in mind. Early peering practices failed to produce revenue flows aligned with value delivery and cost incurrence in the modern Internet. The network neutrality debate is intellectually flawed because it operates within a model where value and revenue are disconnected. Our approach is to redesign the infrastructure so that value and revenue chains align cleanly.

#### Motivation

Todayâ€™s large ISPs combine transit and last-mile delivery, often acting as both CSPs and ISPs. The current transitive method of passing on traffic and recouping costs cannot handle this complexity. Our alternative is to separate transit and last-mile delivery, allowing LMPs and CSPs to recoup costs and extract revenue directly from their customers.

#### Feasibility

While the Public Option Core (POC) is radically different from the status quo, it is incrementally deployable. We aim to start with a demonstration project that can grow over time into a true alternative to the current Internet infrastructure. The success of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) in Europe suggests that this is not far-fetched.

#### Business Perspective

From a business perspective, the POC is a risky proposition, as it would take years to gain the confidence of LMPs. However, the strategy of "Commoditize Your Complement" [50] offers hope. Currently, ISPs and CSPs are complements in a lucrative business, and the POC would allow CSPs to commoditize the ISP market by turning transit into a nonprofit and creating a competitive market in LMPs. Large CSPs could provide initial leased links and guarantees, enhancing credibility.
