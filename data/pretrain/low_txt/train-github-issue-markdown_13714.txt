Several users have inquired about how to load type information from the export data section of a `.a` file generated by the Go compiler. While the standard `go/importer` package can locate (relative to `$GOPATH`) and load a `.a` file, it does not support loading files stored in other locations. In contrast, the older API allowed for separate operations of finding a package (`FindPkg`) and importing it.

To address this, the new package should also provide these functionalities. Currently, users are compelled to fork either the deprecated `x/tools` package or the standard `go/internal/gcimporter` package to achieve this. Enhancing the new package with these features would alleviate the need for such workarounds.
