### Issue Description
I have thoroughly searched the existing issues in this repository and am confident that this is not a duplicate.

### Expected Behavior
When executing the command `NODE_ENV=staging next build`, I expect the `.next` folder to be generated with "staging" as the value of `process.env.NODE_ENV`. However, it is being set to "production" instead.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run the following command: `NODE_ENV=staging next build`

### Environment Details
- **Next.js Version:** 5.0.1-canary.14
- **Node.js Version:** 6.10
