I am relocating this discussion from the comments section. The proposal is to have the kubelet include the SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) of the image(s) running in a pod within the pod's status field. This enhancement would be beneficial for the proposed image policy and related image auditing functionalities.

@erictune, for your information.
