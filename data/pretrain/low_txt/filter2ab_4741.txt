**Title: Black Hat US-19: 100 Seconds of Solitude - Defeating Cisco Trust Anchor with FPGA Bitstream Manipulation**

**Abstract:**

First commercially introduced in 2013, the Cisco Trust Anchor Module (TAm) is a proprietary hardware security module used in a wide range of Cisco products, including enterprise routers, switches, and firewalls. TAm serves as the foundational root of trust, underpinning all other Cisco security and trustworthy computing mechanisms in these devices.

In this presentation, we disclose two zero-day vulnerabilities and demonstrate a remotely exploitable attack chain that reliably bypasses the Cisco Trust Anchor. We provide an in-depth analysis of the TAm from both theoretical and practical perspectives, highlighting a series of architectural and practical flaws. We also discuss the limitations in current state-of-the-art offensive capabilities that made the design of TAm appear secure.

Using the Cisco 1001-X series of Trust Anchor-enabled routers as a demonstrative platform, we conduct a detailed analysis of the current TAm implementation. This includes results obtained through hardware reverse engineering, Trust Anchor FPGA bitstream analysis, and the reverse engineering of numerous Cisco trustworthy computing mechanisms that depend on TAm.

We present two zero-day vulnerabilities within Cisco IOS and TAm, and demonstrate a remotely exploitable attack chain that results in the persistent compromise of an up-to-date Cisco router. Our TAm bypass involves novel methods of reliably manipulating FPGA functionality through bitstream analysis and modification, without the need for RTL reconstruction. These manipulation techniques create new possibilities for exploiting embedded systems that use FPGAs.

While the focus of this presentation is on the application of our FPGA manipulation techniques to the Cisco Trust Anchor, we will also briefly discuss other potential uses of our bitstream modification techniques.
