## Digital Crime Markets

### Introduction
The problem of malware and computer-based theft is increasing in both frequency and complexity. According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), complaints related to spam and phishing have risen over the past two years. Additionally, the Computer Security Institute (CSI) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) report that virus contamination cost businesses $15 million, while botnet damages were estimated at $923,700 in 2006. Law enforcement agencies have begun to intensify their efforts to combat malware users and data thieves, as evidenced by operations such as Operation Firewall and Operation Bot Roast.

### Online Platforms for Malicious Activity
A variety of websites, forums, and IRC channels are dedicated to malicious computer activities, including malware, carding, and the sale of stolen data. These platforms provide real-time information on current and emerging threats, as well as insights into the individuals responsible for creating and distributing these tools. This ecosystem offers a snapshot of the evolving landscape of computer crime.
