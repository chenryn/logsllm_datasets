### Execution Time
The overall execution time of the protocol for multimodal user authentication is less than one second. Note that the number and/or size of the templates may vary depending on the specific application.

### Discussion
The use of cloud technologies for providing biometric services requires the outsourcing of biometric data, which can pose security and privacy risks to users' information. However, the increasing frequency of fraud and malicious attacks has made Biometrics as a Service (BaaS) a competitive arena for advanced and complex cryptographic techniques to ensure the security of private data. Our multimodal Authentication as a Service (AaaS) architecture leverages the large-scale computing resources in the cloud, offering flexibility, mobility, scalability, and cost reduction in terms of data storage and processing power, thereby enhancing the performance of user recognition.

The system securely shares data with remote User Agents (UAs) with biometric databases over the network. Multiparty Computation (MPC) techniques ensure that stored templates, matching, and fusion scores are inaccessible to all parties. There is no biometric data disclosure to the Multimodal Identity Provider (MIP), and consequently, the UAs can only learn that a query for a given user was made, without gaining access to the result of the computation.

Furthermore, our approach implements multimodal biometrics, providing better identification reliability, which is a common requirement for high-security services [122]. Using the multimodal AaaS system, the Service Provider (SP) acquires recognition capabilities without additional infrastructure costs for feature extraction, matching, fusion, and decision modules. This allows the SP to confirm identities via a network connection to the cloud-based MIP and subsequently to the UAs, avoiding time-consuming and costly enrollment procedures, investment in necessary storage capacity, and concerns about legal requirements regarding the security of sensitive information in a Cloud-Based Database (CBDB). This significantly reduces startup, running, and policy costs for both MIPs and SPs.

By enabling quick search, comparison, and accurate fusion, the MIP can help the SP combat fraud and offer an improved user-service interface. Additionally, since Identity Management as a Service (IdMaaS) allows developers of authentication technology to set their statistical and mathematical methods for matching biometrics in the cloud, UAs can securely provision and release shared resources with minimal MIP interaction and management effort. Finally, our approach guarantees that rendered services are accessible only to authorized parties. Thus, instead of enrolling and presenting the same biometric traits across different remote providers, users can trust the storage and processing of their biometrics in an AaaS scheme that applies necessary controls and complies with legal requirements for privacy and security by design.

Our proposed solution for identity management offers a cost-effective, flexible business model for unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal user authentication. It provides greater accountability with biometric logins by connecting an individual to a particular action and is ready for deployment in realistic scenarios, such as government and financial sectors, where higher authentication precision and security without compromising privacy are crucial [91,183].

Although the system is designed for authentication purposes, it can also be used for identification with slight modifications, without requesting and transmitting user credentials to the cloud. One potential application could be a lawful surveillance-oriented scheme for government services, automatically screening and matching crowds (e.g., facial and gait recognition) to identify missing persons. However, computation time would drastically increase for identification use cases. The size of unimodal repositories impacts the overall procedure, and our architecture may become impractical for large-scale biometric databases. Interoperability issues between stored unimodal templates from disparate sensors of the UAs may reduce the multimodal authentication performance, affecting the system's accuracy and robustness. Finally, a clear limitation is the requirements and restrictions imposed by our research methodology. We selected three uncorrelated modalities to perform the matching procedure using Hamming Distance algorithms and a user-specific weighted score level fusion with an applicable sum rule. Although the authentication protocol is flexible and can easily accommodate different unimodal biometrics, matching, and fusion techniques, more complex metrics and processes may affect the complexity and efficiency due to higher costs for biometric extraction and user multimodal recognition.

### Conclusion and Future Work
The amount of biometric data for authentication purposes is increasing rapidly, requiring significant processing and storage capacity. Cloud computing is an innovative infrastructure that allows SPs to manage these challenges efficiently and offer improved AaaS technologies. In this work, we presented a distributed approach for secure and privacy-preserving multimodal AaaS in a domain with mutually distrustful parties. To avoid an auxiliary temporary or permanent CBDB, we utilized already stored unimodal templates held by distinct UAs, which are used in AaaS designs based on single modalities. To obtain a multimodal fused result, we employed Hamming Distance algorithms and a user-specific weighted score level fusion method. MPC techniques were used to build our protocol, ensuring security and privacy in a decentralized manner without information disclosure, thus maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of users' data. The stored biometric information, data transmission, authentication calculations, and final output are protected from untrusted cloud parties. This way, the proposed system leverages the advantages of multimodal biometrics and the efficiency of underlying primitives with computation and communication overhead.

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to propose a privacy-by-design approach for multimodal biometric authentication using cloud-based providers. Our system performs authentication using several biometric features (three in our studied scenario) while avoiding a new enrollment process for users and without requesting additional storage of private data. It offers a convenient solution for precision and reliability while restricting misuses of sensitive information, characterized by dynamic functionality and flexibility in terms of computation and communication efficiency. Moreover, the protocol can be easily extended to update parameters and adjust different biometrics, classifiers, matching methods, and fusion rules. Through the lens of the new European GDPR [66] and the European Regulatory Technical Standards for Strong Customer Authentication (RTS-SCA) [183], biometric markets must revise their infrastructure, taking into account the privacy rights of their users to benefit from the utility of the cloud. Thus, our architecture can serve as a framework for future applications, platforms, and systems where existing biometric datasets need to be leveraged.

We identified five directions for future work on multimodal authentication as BaaS using cloud-based IdMaaS and AaaS providers:
1. **Weighted Score Level Fusion Model:** The system's effectiveness depends on the weighted score level fusion model, where weights are products of the training procedures followed by the UAs subsystems. Although this is a time-consuming process and the available biometric data sources for research are limited, it should be explored how the combination of various thresholds over the range of performance rates affects the overall accuracy and usability of the user-specific fusion methods.
2. **Query Pattern Anonymization:** In the context of MPC, to preserve confidentiality, unobservability, and unlinkability, query patterns can be statistically anonymized to hide the user's identity and real authentication queries count from the remote UAs. This would require protocol changes, where trade-offs between security and efficiency should be assessed.
3. **Template Repository Size:** The size of the templates' repositories of the UAs should be considered for any extension of the protocol to perform in identification mode, evaluating the practicality of the system in terms of computation and communication complexity.
4. **Privacy and Security Frameworks:** Legal regulations allow the migration of users' biometric data to a web interface but prevent personal information transfers outside the organizations' national operating framework [183]. This may limit the flexibility of the UAs that do not comply with the same privacy regulations and constraints, affecting the scalability of multimodal AaaS.
5. **Anti-Spoofing Module:** A critical aspect for AaaS is to integrate an anti-spoofing module, such as a challenge-response user interaction approach for liveness detection, to test stability and resistance against sophisticated fraud attacks.
