### Motivation and Theme
Advances in semiconductor technologies are enabling unprecedented levels of information processing, novel architectural solutions, and a new realm of applications. This is achieved through the integration of extremely large numbers of transistors or processing elements into a single chip. Two main tracks are being considered:
- **"More Moore":** The long-standing trend based on Moore's Law, which aims to reduce the dimensions of silicon microelectronics.
- **"Beyond Moore":** This track includes atomic assemblies of nanoscale technologies such as nanowires, carbon nanotubes, organic molecules, quantum computing, optical computing, and micro/nanofluidics.

Due to the differences in relative advances and current industrial concerns, the workshop will emphasize the "More Moore" track, which raises significant challenges from both dependability and security perspectives. However, considerations related to emerging nanoscale technologies are also within the scope of the workshop.

### Challenges and Vulnerabilities
- **Process Variations:** Significant variations in process parameters can impair circuits, making it difficult for reliability engineers to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields at viable costs.
- **Power Supply and Threshold Levels:** The dramatic reduction in digital devices is accompanied by a decrease in power supply and threshold levels, leading to lower noise immunity and greater sensitivity to particles.
- **Circuit Instabilities:** Additional instabilities, such as Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) in CMOS devices, may affect circuit parameters in operation.
- **Vulnerabilities and Threats:** Examples include information leakages through side-channel attacks, differential fault analysis, and vulnerabilities related to scan-based testing devices.

### Scope and Objectives
The workshop aims to address these impairments and threats, and to identify novel design approaches and operational paradigms that ensure dependable and secure computing. The three main goals are:
- **Review the state-of-knowledge about the main threats in nanocomputing.**
- **Report on existing solutions and propose new design options for mitigating faults and implementing secure and resilient computing devices and systems.**
- **Forecast the risks associated with emerging technologies and foster new trends for cooperative work at technological and system levels.**

### Topics of Interest
- Emerging nanocomputing paradigms and models
- Failure modes and risk assessment
- Yield and mitigation techniques in nanoscale technologies
- Online adaptive and reconfigurable nanoarchitectures
- Design techniques for developing resilient nanosystems
- Fault-tolerant architectures specific to nanoscale circuits
- Scalable verification and testing methodologies
- Network-on-chip and communication protocols

### Submission Guidelines
- **Submissions:** Extended abstracts, work-in-progress reports, or position papers.
- **Format:** IEEE Conference style, not exceeding six pages (including all text, references, appendices, and figures).
- **Content:** Explain the contribution to the field and the novelty of the work, clearly stating the current status.
- **Requirements:** Title, short abstract, and names and contact information of the authors.
- **Refereeing:** Each submission will be fully refereed by three program committee members.
- **Submission Method:** Electronically in PDF format via the workshop webpage: [www.laas.fr/WDSN09](http://www.laas.fr/WDSN09)
- **Presentation Requirement:** Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.
- **Publication:** Accepted papers will be published in the supplement volume of the DSN 2009 proceedings.

### About IOLTS and DSN
In 2009, IOLTS and DSN will be held back-to-back in geographically close sites in the Lisbon area. IOLTS and WDSN cover technically close, though complementary, domains, providing a unique opportunity for participants to benefit from a comprehensive coverage of topics related to dependable and secure computing and critical applications.
