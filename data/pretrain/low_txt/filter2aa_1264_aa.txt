## Chapter 1: Mail Service Setup

### Introduction

Mail service in Mac OS X Server enables network users to send and receive email over your network or across the Internet. It uses standard Internet mail protocols: Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), Post Office Protocol (POP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). DNS service is also used to determine the destination IP address of outgoing mail.

### Mail Service Protocols
