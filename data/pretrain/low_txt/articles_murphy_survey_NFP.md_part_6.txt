The variation in prediction performance between using a narrower set of features common to all types of equipment and a wider set of specialized features not common to all types of equipment is worthy of further investigation. The different studies surveyed in the field of Network Fault Prediction (NFP) treat a wide selection of mostly homogeneous network types, making the results difficult to compare. Each application tends to have different characteristics, leading authors to set up each problem differently.

As a consequence of specific networks having different crucial constraints, the overall prediction performance metrics are not uniform, which contributes to the difficulty in comparing studies. The field of NFP lacks open data and a standardized way to measure performance comparatively. NFP would benefit significantly from the establishment of one or several benchmark datasets where different methods could be tested, setting the stage for more consolidated research. Research studies remain to be explored to address the key issues of NFP for heterogeneous networks.
