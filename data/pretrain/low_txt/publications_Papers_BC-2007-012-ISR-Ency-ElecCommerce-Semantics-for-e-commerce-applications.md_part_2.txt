### Challenges in Supply Chain Processes and the Role of Semantics

Supply chain processes present significant challenges (Stohr & Zhao, 2001). For B2C and B2B links to be successful, web services from multiple companies need to be seamlessly integrated and interoperable. This integration is crucial for matching both functional and operational requirements. A robust model for execution semantics can help coordinate activities in e-commerce applications involving multiple parties.

Compared to traditional distributed applications, web services are highly autonomous and heterogeneous. Therefore, sophisticated methods are essential to support their integration. One possible solution is to explore the use of semantics to enhance interoperability among web services.

### Achieving Interoperability in E-Commerce Applications

To achieve interoperability in e-commerce applications, it is necessary to address the problem of semantic integration. This involves identifying semantically similar objects across different systems and resolving their schematic differences (Kashyap & Sheth, 1996). When web services are combined, their interfaces (inputs and outputs) must interoperate (Cardoso & Sheth, 2003). Thus, structural and semantic heterogeneity must be resolved. Structural heterogeneity arises because web services use different data structures to define their interface parameters. Semantic conflicts occur when a web service output connected to another service input does not use the same interpretation of the information being transferred.

The general approach to semantic integration is to map local terms onto a shared ontology. Although a shared ontology ensures total integration, constructing such an ontology can be costly (Rodríguez & Egenhofer, 2002). However, recent progress in ontology evolution/management (Gandon, 2002) and multi-ontology environments (Fonseca, 2011) has increased momentum in developing and applying semantics to integrate different systems.

### Execution Semantics

Execution semantics of a web service (WSMX, 2004) encompass the ideas of message sequence and conversation. Three major projects will provide several advances in the area of Semantic Web processes in the near term:

1. **Semantic Web Services Initiative (SWSI)**: An initiative by academic and industrial researchers, SWSI aims to create an infrastructure that combines the Semantic Web and web services to enable automation in all aspects of web services. It also focuses on evolving the ontology language for web services, OWL-S (OWL-S, 2004), and working towards convergence with other research efforts.

2. **METEOR-S (LSDIS, 2004)**: This project focuses on using semantics for the complete lifecycle of Semantic Web processes, targeting research in annotation, discovery, composition, and execution of web services.

3. **DERI (DERI, 2004)**: The SWWS (Semantic Web-Enabled Web Services) project aims to provide a richer framework for web service description and discovery, as well as scalable web service mediation middleware based on semantic data, process ontologies, and semantic interoperation.

### Future Trends

According to TopQuadrant, a consulting firm specializing in Semantic Web technologies, the market for semantic technologies is expected to grow at an annual rate of 60% to 70% until 2010, reaching $63 billion from its current size of $2 billion. Existing applications, such as Adobe’s Extensible Metadata Platform and Oracle’s database, are adding Semantic Web capabilities. 

Semantic software is being experimentally used by banks to comply with the U.S. government’s Patriot Act, by a European police force to track crime patterns, and by a telephone service provider to create applications providing information about pay-per-view movies (Lee, 2005).

In addition to investment banks, organizations like the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the Tennessee Valley Authority have used semantic software to integrate enterprise data and comply with federal regulations.

### Conclusion

E-commerce has fundamentally changed how trading activities are conducted. Consumers can now acquire services and products from a variety of websites. With the spread of the Web, a new technology—Semantic Web processes—has emerged for developing e-commerce applications. This trend requires the ability to deploy e-commerce applications based on web processes from the aggregation and orchestration of distributed web services. Researchers agree that web services must be semantically enabled to efficiently develop and execute web processes.

In this chapter, we have presented the challenges brought by the emergence of e-commerce and Semantic Web processes. Designing Semantic Web processes involves research in two areas: web services and the Semantic Web. We have shown how applying semantics to each step in the web process lifecycle can address critical issues such as web service annotation, discovery, selection, integration, and execution.

- **Business Process**: A set of one or more linked activities that collectively realize a business objective or goal, normally within the context of an organizational structure.
- **HTTP**: The underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web. HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between web servers and browsers.
- **Ontology**: An ontology provides the basis for representing, acquiring, and utilizing knowledge. Ontologies consist of entities, attributes, interrelationships between entities, domain vocabulary, and factual knowledge.
- **Semantics**: The purpose of semantics is to assign meaning to syntactical elements. For web services, it is the agreed-upon meaning of data, functions, QoS, etc., exchanged between two or more services.
- **UDDI**: Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration. UDDI is a registry for businesses to list themselves on the Internet. Its goal is to facilitate online transactions by enabling companies to find one another on the Web and make their systems interoperable for e-commerce. UDDI is often compared to a telephone book’s white, yellow, and green pages.
- **Web Process**: A web process describes the logic to control and coordinate web services participating in a process flow to carry out a specific goal. It directly addresses business process challenges such as control flow, data flow between web services, long-running nested units of work, faults, and compensation.
- **Web Service**: A web service describes a standardized way of integrating web-based applications using open standards. A web service is defined as a remotely callable function or procedure that communicates via the HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) using standardized protocols.
- **WSDL**: Web Services Description Language. It is written in XML and is used to describe and locate web services.
