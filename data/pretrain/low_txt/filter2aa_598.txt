**Author: Weston Hecker, 9/16/2013**

### Who Am I and What Is This Talk About?
- **About Me**: 
  - Penetration Tester with a background in Computer Science and Geophysics.
  - Extensive certifications and experience in custom exploit development, including PMS Hotel Software, two-way reservation fuzzing, and RFID scanners.
  - Over 9 years of experience in penetration testing, disaster recovery, and security research.
  - Compliance audits for NERC, FFIEC, ISO, GLBA, FDIC, HIPAA, and Omnibus.
  - Custom exploits and scripts for obscure Internet Service Provider (ISP) gear.
  - Tools of the trade: "Fleet of Fake iPhones."
  - Creation of a phone call bomber from a prepaid phone to a solar-powered hacker tool hidden in a light fixture at a public library.
  - Demonstration: 15 phones taking down a 200-person call center.
  - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) on phone systems: what it is, how it's used, and its impact on businesses.
  - Alternate uses once a phone has been flashed into an attack platform.

- **Tools**:
  - Fleet of Fake iPhones with Teensy 3.0
  - RFID Badge Reader

## What is DDoS and TDoS? How Do They Differ?

- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**:
  - An attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.
  - Typically involves efforts to temporarily or indefinitely interrupt or suspend services of a host connected to the Internet.
  
- **Telephony Denial of Service (TDoS)**:
  - A flood of unwanted, malicious inbound calls, usually targeting contact centers or other voice-dependent parts of an enterprise.
  - Definition sourced from Wikipedia.

## Instances of TDoS

- **Bank Fraud (CNP) Theft**
- **Bank Transfer Mule Scams**
- **Unintentional from Spoofed Scammer CID**
- **Call Center Attacks**
- **Politically Motivated Activism**

## Current Methods of TDoS

- **Caller ID Spoof Reflection Attack**
- **Malware on Phones and Call Management Software**
- **Script to Load Caller Information onto Real Estate Web Pages**
- **Hijacked PRI and SIP Services War Dialing**
- **Caller ID Reflection Attack**
- **Legitimate Phone Service with Spoofed Caller ID Information**
- **Thousand Calls Returned to the Number That Believes It Called Them**
- **Using Salespeople to TDoS for You**
- **Page with Generic Templates**
- **Input Fields Automatically Filled In**
- **List of URLs and Information Off Input Field**
- **Web Crawling Bots**
  - 76% of realtor web pages use the same scripts without CAPTCHAs.
  - Script posts to over 4,600 realtor pages in 2 hours.
- **Botnets of Infected Smartphones**
  - Rooted phones increase security risks.

## Developing a Weaponized OEM Cellphone Platform

- **Prepaid Cell Phones Running Brew 3.1 Operating System**
  - CDMA 1X 800/1900 MHz Digital Only
  - Samsung U365 (Gusto 2)
  - QSC6055 192 MHz Processor
  - Secure Boot, SEE, SFS
  - No application processor, making security easy to bypass.
  - Great, easy development software written in C/C++.
  - BREW provides control over voicemail and device activation/deactivation.
  - Exploit in IRingerMgr allows interaction with clam and speaker manipulations.
  - Secondary display for devices supporting a secondary display.
  - Modified executable allows software to be pushed to the device, bypassing security features.
  - Exploiting a certificate expiration error.
  - Modified driver files allow modifications of all device information.
  - PRL (Preferred Roaming List) can be pulled from device activity.
  - Emulation of the U365 device for testing applications without loading them on the device.

## Now That You Have Your Own Fully Unlocked Platform, What Next?

- **OEM Development Platform**
  - With the attack platform loaded on the phone, you have full control over all devices, including TDoS and brick mode.
  - Setting up ringtones as specific payloads.
  - Cheese Box: Call one phone number, which is passed via Bluetooth to a second phone, creating an untraceable phone proxy.
  - Phone calls target numbers three times in a row, recording an MP3 to a Bluetooth-connected PC.
  - Files created with Bluetooth connection, run through speech-to-text open-source software.
  - Prepaid cell phone can deny legitimate phone calls for 5 days straight.
  - Anonymous purchase, $2 per day usage, untraceable with solar USB charger, easily hidden in a light fixture.
  - Total investment for a 5-day TDoS attack platform is $20 USD with a solar USB charger.
  - Phone being turned into a call bomber, firmware and PRL updated, plugged into a laptop, and reflashed in under 8 minutes.
  - Crashing call software by TDoS, launching 10 phones with a weaponized platform, CPU and RAM utilization crashing call center VM.

## Scenarios of TDoS

- **Blocking 911 Systems**
- **Alarm Companies During Break-ins**
- **Federal Agencies During Terrorist Attacks**
- **Stores During Holiday Seasons**
- **Any Person or Organization That Is Disliked**
