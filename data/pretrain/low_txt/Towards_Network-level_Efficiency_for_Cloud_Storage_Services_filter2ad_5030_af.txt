### Hybrid Storage Clusters and Filesystem Performance

A cloud storage service can utilize a hybrid SSD+HDD cluster or even a tape-based cluster [41]. The performance of the filesystem is crucial for the overall efficiency of the service. For example, OpenStack Swift performs better with XFS than with EXT3/EXT4, as noted in the official OpenStack development documentation [13]. Additionally, seemingly independent infrastructure components may have deep, hidden dependencies that can lead to unexpected correlated failures, thereby undermining redundancy efforts and operational efficiency [46, 47].

### Call for Data Sharing

We urge cloud storage service providers to release their proprietary traces to facilitate future research in this field.

### Related Work

As cloud storage services become more pervasive and change the way people store and share data, numerous academic studies have focused on various aspects, including the design and implementation of service infrastructure [22, 43, 44, 31], integration of features and functionalities [29, 28, 23, 42, 36, 35, 34], performance measurement [33, 25, 24, 20, 45], and privacy and security issues [40, 21, 38, 27, 32]. While these studies cover data synchronization (sync) mechanisms and resulting traffic usage, none comprehensively address the efficiency of traffic usage. Due to system complexity and implementation differences, it is challenging to form a general and unified view of traffic usage efficiency, let alone propose further improvements.

Our work differs from and complements previous studies by quantifying and optimizing traffic usage efficiency, a pivotal network-level metric for cloud storage services. Based on measurements and analysis of six state-of-the-art cloud storage services, we identify key impact factors and design choices that significantly affect traffic usage efficiency. Most importantly, we provide guidance and implications for both service providers and end users to optimize their sync traffic usage.

### Dropbox Case Study

Dropbox, one of the earliest and most popular cloud storage services, has been extensively studied. Drago et al. [25] uncovered performance bottlenecks in Dropbox due to its system architecture and data sync mechanism through an ISP-level large-scale measurement. They suggested a bundling sync scheme with delayed sync ACK to improve performance. Li et al. [36] identified a "traffic overuse problem" in Dropbox, where a large amount of unnecessary traffic is uploaded. They proposed an efficient batched sync algorithm (UDS) to address this issue. Our results, however, are not limited to Dropbox; they provide general insights applicable to designing network-efficient cloud storage services.

### Partial Coverage in Previous Studies

Some studies have partially covered traffic usage in cloud storage services. Hu et al. [30] compared the traffic usage, delay time, and CPU usage of four cloud storage services when uploading new files, observing substantial variations based on factors like file size, data compressibility, and data duplication levels. Drago et al. [24] compared the system capabilities of five cloud storage services, finding limitations in data synchronization. Both studies highlight the importance of sync traffic usage and the potential for further optimization.

### Comprehensive Analysis

In this paper, we delve into a comprehensive understanding of traffic usage efficiency. Unlike the simplified benchmarks used in previous studies [36, 30, 24], we consider the diversity of access methods, client locations, hardware configurations, and network conditions to match real-world usage. We discover that these factors lead to different traffic usage patterns, some of which are unexpected. Additionally, we focus on mobile usage, as mobile users are particularly affected by traffic overuse.

### Conclusion and Future Work

The significant increase in data sync traffic has brought growing pains to today’s cloud storage services, both in terms of infrastructure support and monetary costs. This paper quantifies and analyzes the data sync traffic usage efficiency (TUE) of six widely used cloud storage services using real-world traces and comprehensive experiments. Our findings confirm that much of the data sync traffic is unnecessary and can be avoided or mitigated with careful design. In other words, there is substantial room for optimizing the network-level efficiency of existing cloud storage services. We hope our work will inspire cloud storage designers to enhance their systems and guide users in choosing appropriate services.

In June 2014, Apple Inc. announced iCloud Drive, a new component of iCloud, at its annual WWDC conference. With over 300 million users, iCloud Drive is expected to rank higher than several cloud storage services studied in this paper (e.g., Dropbox and Box). Multiple research groups, including ours, are eager to investigate the network-level efficiency of iCloud Drive, but as of August 2014, the service is still unavailable to common users [10]. We believe that the network-level efficiency of iCloud Drive will be a promising research topic, given its unique and closed ecosystem.
