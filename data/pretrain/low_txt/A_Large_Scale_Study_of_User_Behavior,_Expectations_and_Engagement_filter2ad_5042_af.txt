Users were asked to state how much they agree or disagree with each statement in this survey using the following 5 options:
- Strongly Agree
- Agree
- Neither Agree Nor Disagree
- Disagree
- Strongly Disagree

Note that question 4 in the Control section (A.5.1) is the opposite of the statement in question 4 of the Collection Section (A.5.3). This was inserted as an attention-checking question. Surveys with contradictory answers were not used.

**A.5.1 Control Section Questions**
1. Mobile app privacy is about a user’s right to exercise control over decisions about how their information is collected, used, and shared.
2. User control of personal information is essential to mobile app privacy.
3. I believe that mobile app privacy is compromised when the user loses control over their information as a result of app usage.
4. I’m not concerned that smartphone apps are collecting too much personal information about me.

**A.5.2 Awareness of Privacy Practices Section Questions**
1. Mobile app developers seeking information should disclose the way the data are collected, processed, and used.
2. A good mobile app privacy policy should have a clear and conspicuous disclosure.
3. It is very important to me that I am aware and knowledgeable about how my personal information will be used.

**A.5.3 Collection Section Questions**
1. It usually bothers me when smartphone apps ask me for personal information.
2. When mobile apps ask me for personal information, I sometimes think twice before providing it.
3. It bothers me to give personal information to so many mobile apps.
4. I’m concerned that smartphone apps are collecting too much personal information about me.

**A.5.4 Secondary Use Section Questions**
1. Mobile apps should not use personal information for any purpose unless it has been authorized by the individuals who provided the information.
2. When people give personal information to a mobile app for some reason, the app developer should never use the information for any other reason.
3. Mobile app developers should never sell the personal information in their computer databases to other companies.
4. Mobile app developers should never share personal information with other companies unless it has been authorized by the individual who provided the information.

### B. PrivaDroid Technical Details

PrivaDroid supports Android versions starting from Android 6.0, in which the runtime permission system was introduced, up to Android 10. The data is stored off-device in a Firebase cloud datastore. When one of the app install or permission decision events happens, PrivaDroid will detect it and create a notification that can direct the users to the corresponding survey. App install events are detected by listening to the `ACTION_PACKAGE_ADDED` Android system broadcast intents. For devices running Android 8.0 or higher, we additionally implemented a foreground service to listen to these broadcast events. Package name, app name, and the app version name are logged by probing the Android Package Installer.

Capturing permission events is more challenging as no system intent is broadcast when a permission request is granted or denied. A seemingly obvious way to observe permission changes is to consistently poll the permissions granted for an app using the `getInstalledPackages` API and check if anything changes. However, this approach can only capture permission changes but not the permission decisions that do not result in any change. For example, denying a request for a permission that was already denied before will not be caught. Instead, PrivaDroid uses the accessibility service facility to monitor the screen that participants view and looks for UI elements with specific strings or View IDs to detect permission prompts, and uses the app usage permission to detect which app package requested the permission. Based on the information, it then extracts the app name, permission name, and the participant’s grant/deny decisions.

We only use data of participants who have the application continually installed for the length of the study. However, participants may leave the study anytime they wish and do not need to explicitly inform us when they leave. To detect if a participant has left the study, PrivaDroid implements a heartbeat message that will be sent to its Firebase datastore daily. The heartbeat message contains two booleans, which indicate whether the accessibility service and app usage access are enabled for PrivaDroid. These two booleans are used to determine if a user’s data is valid and should be included in our analysis. Additionally, if PrivaDroid detects that either the accessibility service or app usage permission has been revoked, but the PrivaDroid app has not been uninstalled, the PrivaDroid app will create a notification prompting the participant to re-enable those capabilities in case they were disabled by accident.
