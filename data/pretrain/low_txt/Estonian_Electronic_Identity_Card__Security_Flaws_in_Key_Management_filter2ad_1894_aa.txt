## Abstract

The Estonian electronic identity card (ID card) is one of the most successful implementations of smart card-based national ID systems globally. The card uses public-key cryptography and private keys stored on the chip to enable access to e-services, legally binding digital signatures, and even i-voting in national elections.

In this paper, we detail several security flaws discovered in the ID card manufacturing process. These flaws were identified by analyzing public-key certificates from the public ID card certificate repository. Specifically, we found instances where private keys were generated outside the chip, contrary to security requirements. In some cases, the same private key was imported into different cardholders' ID cards, allowing for impersonation. Additionally, a separate flaw in the manufacturing process led to corrupted RSA public key moduli, which in one case resulted in the full recovery of the corresponding private key. This paper describes the discovery process and the incident response taken by the authorities.

## 1. Introduction

Estonia issues various types of credit card-sized identity documents (ID cards) that contain a smart card chip. The embedded cryptographic functionality enables secure authentication over the Internet and the creation of legally binding digital signatures. The Estonian ID card rollout began in 2002 and is considered one of the most successful in terms of dissemination and active use. As of the second half of 2018, 67% of the 1.3 million Estonian residents had used the ID card electronically at least once [1].

The security of this electronic identity scheme relies on the secrecy of the cardholder's private keys. It is crucial that these keys are generated securely and accessible only to the corresponding cardholder. In the Estonian ID card scheme, key management (key generation and certificate issuance) is delegated to the ID card manufacturer. Ensuring that the manufacturer generates high-quality keys and does not store copies is essential. Unfortunately, there are no effective controls to verify the manufacturer's trustworthiness and proper handling of key management. The industry's response to these concerns has been that manufacturers are in the business of trust and would not risk their reputation through poor security practices or malicious behavior.

Our work demonstrates, using the Estonian ID card as an example, that this trust model can fail. We show that the ID card manufacturer engaged in sloppy security practices, ignored repeated signs of faults in the key management process, and intentionally breached the ID card manufacturing contract by creating copies of cardholders' private keys. Although these findings have led to litigation against the ID card manufacturer, Gemalto [2], there is no evidence that this loss of trust has impacted Gemalto's reputation or business value, thus failing to serve as a deterrent for such misbehavior.

Our findings are based on the analysis of ID card public-key certificates collected over the years from the public ID card certificate repository. We present three separate studies conducted at different times, detailing the context and the process of identifying and handling the flaws.

## 2. Estonian ID Card

### 2.1 Cryptographic Functionality

Since its introduction in 2002, the core cryptographic functionality of the Estonian ID card has remained consistent. The card contains two asymmetric (RSA or ECC) keys with corresponding X.509 public-key certificates and symmetric keys for card management operations.

- **Authentication Key:** Used for logging into e-services via TLS client certificate authentication. It can also decrypt documents encrypted for the cardholder. Signature and decryption operations require authorization using a 4-digit PIN1 code.
- **Digital Signature Key:** Used for legally binding digital signatures recognized under eIDAS [5]. Each signature operation requires authorization using a 5-digit PIN2 code.
- **Card Management Operations:** Symmetric keys preloaded onto the cards allow the manufacturer to perform various post-issuance operations, such as resetting PIN codes, generating new keys, writing new certificates, and reinstalling the smart card applet if needed.

### 2.2 Parties Involved

- **Police and Border Guard Board (PPA):** Responsible for procuring ID card manufacturing services and issuing identity documents.
- **SK ID Solutions AS (SK):** A privately-owned Estonian Certificate Authority (CA) and qualified trust service provider, issuing qualified certificates. SK is a subcontractor of the card manufacturer.
- **Estonian Information System Authority (RIA):** State agency responsible for coordinating and developing electronic identity and cybersecurity. RIA also organizes the development of ID card client-side software.

### 2.4 Certificate Repository

All valid ID card certificates issued by SK are available in the public LDAP directory `ldap://ldap.sk.ee` [16]. The publication of certificates facilitates document encryption by providing senders with convenient means to obtain recipients' public keys. ID card certificates include the cardholder's full name and personal identification code (personal ID code), a unique 11-digit number used in public and private databases. The validity period of the certificate usually matches the validity period of the identity document.

### 2.5 Certificates Analyzed in This Work

We have collected over 7 million ID card certificates from the LDAP certificate repository. Our dataset, while not complete, provides a representative sample of ID card certificates issued over the years. Figure 7 shows the distribution of ID card certificates by issuance month for different ID card platforms. The dataset lacks certificates issued from 2002 to 2007 and those valid for a short period, so our findings provide a lower bound for the number of affected certificates.

We also collected certificate revocation information from publicly available CRLs [17], which allowed us to deduce important insights for this study.

## 3. Related Work

Over the 17-year history of the Estonian ID card, several security flaws have been publicly disclosed:

- **ROCA Flaw (2017):** Over 700,000 ID cards powered by the jTOP SLE78 platform were affected by Inﬁneon’s RSA key generation flaw, leading to the Estonian ID card crisis. The vulnerability allowed factoring 2048-bit RSA keys in just 140.8 CPU-years. The issue was mitigated by switching to ECC and revoking vulnerable RSA certificates [18, 19].
- **2011 ID Card Recall:** 120,000 ID cards issued in 2011 were recalled due to a publicly undisclosed flaw in the EstEID JavaCard applet, later revealed to be a potential PIN bypass flaw [20, 21].
- **PIN Envelope Flaw (2002, 2018):** PIN codes were printed too darkly, allowing them to be seen through the envelope. This flaw was reintroduced in 2018 by IDEMIA [22, 23].
- **Other Incidents:** Duplicate email addresses in certificates, incorrectly encoded public keys, failure to revoke certificates of deceased persons, and other issues [24, 25, 26].

## 4. Certificates with Duplicate RSA Public Keys

In spring 2013, we discovered several certificate pairs in our dataset that shared the same RSA public keys. Further investigation revealed that the affected ID cards also shared the same private keys. This suggested that, contrary to security requirements, the ID card manufacturer had generated keys outside the card. We obtained convincing evidence that most ID card keys were generated within the card, but a specific set of keys produced during the ID card renewal process were generated externally. This violation was likely motivated by performance reasons.
