### Uninstalling a Connector

Before uninstalling a connector that is running as a service or daemon, first stop the service or daemon.

- **On Windows:**
  1. Open the Start menu.
  2. Run the Uninstall SmartConnectors program located under All Programs > ArcSight SmartConnectors.
  3. If Connectors are not installed in the Start menu, locate the `$ARCSIGHT_HOME\UninstallerData` folder and run `Uninstall ArcSightAgents.exe`.

- **On UNIX hosts:**
  1. Open a command window in the `$ARCSIGHT_HOME/UninstallerData` directory.
  2. Run the command: `./Uninstall_ArcSightAgents`

**Note:** The `UninstallerData` directory contains a file `.com.zerog.registry.xml` with Read, Write, and Execute permissions for everyone. On Windows platforms, these permissions are required for the uninstaller to work. On UNIX platforms, you can change the permissions to Read and Write for everyone (i.e., 666). The Uninstaller does not remove all files and directories under the ArcSight SmartConnector home folder. After completing the uninstall procedure, manually delete these folders.

### Upgrading a Connector

To locally upgrade the Forwarding Connector:

1. Stop the running connector.
2. Run the new installer for the ArcSight Forwarding Connector, which prompts you for an installation location.
3. Select the location of the Forwarding Connector you want to upgrade. You will receive the message “Previous Version Found - Upgrade Possible.” Select the option to continue and upgrade the connector.
4. The original installation is renamed by prefacing characters to the original folder name; the upgraded connector is installed in the location `$ARCSIGHT_HOME\current`.
5. During the upgrade, the "Default User Groups" user group is updated, and the `/All Filters/ArcSight System/Core/No Events` filter is added to the events ACL. If the Forwarding Connector user is in that group, the connector cannot send events to the destination Manager. To prevent this problem, edit the access control for the Forwarding Connector's parent user group and select a filter that gives permission to the subset of events for which the user has access. Alternatively, if the user has access to all the events, delete the `/All Filters/ArcSight System/Core/No Events` filter.
6. The ArcSight Forwarding Connectors must be of the same version as the source ESM.

### Rolling Back a Connector

To roll back a connector:

1. Stop the upgraded connector, which is under `current`.
2. Rename the `current` folder to a name based upon the build version of the upgraded connector.
3. Rename the old connector build folder to `current`.
4. Start the connector.

**Note:** Rolling back the connector to build 5116 or earlier disallows use of the McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator destination.

### Chapter 2: Configuration for Forwarding Events

This chapter provides step-by-step instructions for configuring various Forwarding Connector destinations. The following destinations are described:

- “Forwarding Events to an ArcSight Manager” on page 15
- “Forwarding Events to ArcSight Logger” on page 19
- “Forwarding Events to NSP Device Poll Listener” on page 20
- “Forwarding CEF Syslog Events” on page 21
- “Forwarding Events to a CSV File” on page 22
- “Forwarding Events to McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator” on page 23
- “Configuring Multiple Destinations” on page 26

### Forwarding Events to an ArcSight Manager

To configure the connector for forwarding events to an ArcSight Manager:

1. Select ArcSight Manager (encrypted) and click Next.
2. The Wizard first prompts you for Manager certificate information. The default is No, the ArcSight Manager is not using a demo certificate. Choose Yes if the ArcSight Manager is using a demo certificate. Before selecting this option, ensure the Manager is using a demo SSL certificate. If unsure, select No or consult your system administrator.
3. If your ArcSight Manager is using a self-signed or CA-signed SSL certificate, select No, the ArcSight Manager is not using a demo certificate, and click Next.
4. Enter the Manager Host Name and Manager Port. This is your destination Manager. Click Next.
5. Enter a valid ArcSight User Name and Password and click Next.
6. You are given a choice of Forwarding Connector versions to install. If you are currently using ESM v4.0 SP3 or later, ArcSight recommends choosing the ArcSight Forwarding Connector (Enhanced) option. When choosing which version to use, note the following:
   - The ArcSight Forwarding Connector option supports the previous software version and does not include the increased event rate and recoverability features of ArcSight Forwarding Connector (Enhanced). ArcSight recommends using the older option only when communicating with a pre-v4.0 SP3 ESM installation.
   - Neither Forwarding Connector release is FIPS compliant. If you require FIPS compliance, retain your current Forwarding Connector version.
   - The capacity of events that can be stored during a system failure is dependent on the FileStore size of your source Manager. Choosing the ArcSight Forwarding Connector (Enhanced) version requires configuration adjustments on your source Manager. For instructions on how to determine and change your source disk settings, see “Increasing the FileStore size (Enhanced version only)” on page 11. Click Next.
7. Enter the information to configure the Forwarding Connector, then click Next to continue. This includes the ArcSight Source Manager Hostname, Port, User Name, and Password.
8. Enter a name for the connector and provide other identifying information. Click Next.
9. Review the connector summary. If it is correct, click Next. If not, click Previous to make changes before continuing.
10. When the connector completes its configuration, click Next. The wizard now prompts you to choose whether you want to run the connector as a process or as a service. If you choose to run the connector as a service, the wizard prompts you to define service parameters for the connector.
11. After making your selections, click Next. The wizard displays a dialog confirming the connector's setup and service configuration.
12. Click Finish.
13. Click Done.

### Forwarding Events to ArcSight Logger

When configuring the Forwarding Connector to send events to a non-ESM destination, you might encounter problems with certificate validation during connector setup. See “Sending Events to a Non-ESM Location” on page 7 for information on certificate validation. Ensure that a SmartMessage Receiver has been set up on ArcSight Logger for the Forwarding Connector (refer to the ArcSight Logger Administrator's Guide for details).

To configure the connector for forwarding events to an ArcSight Logger:

1. Select ArcSight Logger SmartMessage (encrypted).
2. Enter the Logger Host Name/IP address, leave the port number at the default value of 443, and enter the Receiver Name. This Receiver Name is the name of the SmartMessage Receiver you set up on ArcSight Logger for the Forwarding Connector. Click Next to continue.
3. Click Next and continue following the steps to complete your configuration. Refer to the Parameters on page 18 for parameter descriptions. When a message confirms that the configuration was successful, click Finish to exit the wizard.

### Forwarding Events to NSP Device Poll Listener

When configuring the Forwarding Connector to send events to a non-ESM destination, you might encounter problems with certificate validation during connector setup. See “Sending Events to a Non-ESM Location” on page 7 for information on certificate validation.

To configure the connector for forwarding events to NSP:

For more information about NSP, refer to the ArcSight™ NSP Installation and Administration Guide.

### Forwarding CEF Syslog Events

You can also configure the ArcSight Forwarding Connector to send CEF Syslog events to any Syslog receiver (including ArcSight Logger). When configuring the Forwarding Connector to send events to a non-ESM destination, you might encounter problems with certificate validation during connector setup. See “Sending Events to a Non-ESM Location” on page 7 for information on certificate validation.

To configure the connector to send CEF Syslog events:

1. Select CEF Syslog.
2. Enter the Logger hostname or IP address, the desired port, and choose UDP or TCP output. Click Next to continue.
3. Click Next and continue following the Configuration Wizard to complete your configuration until a message confirms that it was successful. Click Finish to exit the wizard.

### Forwarding Events to a CSV File

This option allows you to capture events a SmartConnector would normally send to the ArcSight Manager and send them to a .csv file. The Excel-compatible comma-separated-values (CSV) format allows for comments prefixed by #.

When configuring the Forwarding Connector to send events to a non-ESM destination, you might encounter problems with certificate validation during connector setup. See “Sending Events to a Non-ESM Location” on page 7 for information on certificate validation.

To forward events to a .csv file:

1. Select CSV File and click Next.
2. Enter values as described in the table below:

| Parameter             | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CSV Path              | The path to the output folder. If one does not exist, a folder is created.  |
| Fields                | A comma-delimited string of field names to be sent to the .csv file. Field names are in the form `event..`. |
| File rotation interval| The desired file rotation interval, in seconds. The default is 3,600 (one hour). |
| Write format header   | Select true to send a header row with labels for each column, as described above. |

3. Click Next and continue following the steps to complete your configuration until a message confirms that it was successful. Click Finish to exit the wizard.

For more information about capturing events and .csv files, refer to the section titled “Capturing Events from SmartConnectors (ESM v4.0)” in the SmartConnector User’s Guide.

### Forwarding Events to McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator

This option allows you to forward events to McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO), a scalable tool for centralized anti-virus and security policy management and enforcement. ePO leverages ESM event filtering/correlation and auditing capabilities to create a single view into security events within ePO. McAfee ePO v4.0 and v4.5 are supported currently.

**Note:** Use of ePO requires the installation of MSSQL Server 2005 for JDBC driver. For instructions on downloading, see “Installing the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Driver for JDBC” on page 24.

To forward events to McAfee ePO:

1. On the destination selection window, select McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator and click Next.
2. When using this transport, the Forwarding Connector is automatically configured to limit the outgoing event rate to 10 events per minute. This is due to a limitation on McAfee ePO’s database as specified by McAfee.
