**Current Behavior**  
When a module is loaded lazily using `loadChildren` and the active route is different, the `NgModule` constructor is called twice. However, when the `NgModule` is the active route, the constructor is invoked only once.

**Expected/Desired Behavior**  
The `NgModule` should be loaded and compiled only once, regardless of the active route.

**Environment Information:**
- **Angular Version:** 2.0.0-rc.5
- **Browser:** Chrome 53
- **Language:** TypeScript 2.0
