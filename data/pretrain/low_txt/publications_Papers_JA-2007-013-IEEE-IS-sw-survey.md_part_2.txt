### Ontology Domains
In their 2006 study, Cardoso and Sheth identified the state of the art in applications using semantics and ontologies. These applications ranged from semantic Web services and discovery, semantic integration of tourism information sources, semantic digital libraries, semantic grids, semantic enterprise information integration, semantic Web search, to the development of bioinformatics ontologies.

To determine the current trends in ontology development for specific domains, we asked respondents to indicate the industries they represent with ontologies. The survey provides a broad perspective from various industries. The most represented industries are:
- **Education**: 31.0%
- **Computer Software**: 28.5%
- **Government**: 17.0%
- **Business Services**: 17.0%
- **Life Sciences**: 16.5%
- **Communications**: 13.0%
- **Media**: 12.8%
- **Healthcare Providers**: 11.3%

Other notable industries include Automotive (9.8%), Manufacturing (8.6%), Consulting and Systems Integration (7.4%), Banking and Financial Services (6.6%), Hospitality and Entertainment (3.7%), Transportation (3.4%), Energy and Utilities (3.2%), Insurance (2.0%), Retail (1.7%), and Consumer Packaged Goods (0.7%). Additionally, 12.5% of respondents indicated "Other" industries, such as Accessibility, Agriculture, Archaeology, eRecruitment, Geography, Geosciences, Human Resource Management, Microelectronics, Physics, Satellites, Sports, and the Toy industry.

### Methodologies
In software engineering, a methodology is essential for building a software product. Since ontologies are considered software products, methodologies, methods, and techniques are indispensable for documenting the development process. Ontological Engineering (OE) is the discipline that studies such methodologies (Gómez-Pérez et al., 2007). However, OE is still a relatively immature discipline, and many workgroups use their own methodologies.

We asked respondents to indicate the methodology or method they employ for developing ontologies. Surprisingly, 60% of respondents do not use any methodology. The most adopted methodologies among ontologists are:
- **METHONTOLOGY**: 13.7%
- **On-To-Knowledge methodology**: 7.4%
- **Uschold and King’s method**: 4.2%

Other less commonly used methods include the Cyc method, Gruninger and Fox’s methodology, DILIGENT method, KACTUS method, SENSUS method, and Noy and McGuinness method.

**Figure 8. Methodologies used to develop ontologies.**

### Purpose of Using Ontologies
Organizations use ontologies for various purposes. We asked participants to specify their reasons for using ontologies, based on the motivations identified by Noy and McGuinness (2001).

- **To share common understanding of the structure of information among people or software agents**: 69.9%
- **To enable reuse of domain knowledge**: 56.3%
- **To make domain assumptions explicit**: 36.9%
- **To analyze domain knowledge**: 34.2%
- **To separate domain knowledge from operational knowledge**: 29.9%
- **Other purposes**: 12.4% (including code generation, data integration, data publication and exchange, document annotation, information retrieval, search, reasoning, annotating experiments, building common vocabularies, web service discovery or mediation, and enabling interoperability)

### Techniques Used with Ontologies
We asked respondents to indicate if they use any specific techniques to manipulate ontologies, such as mapping, aligning, merging, and integration. The results are as follows:

- **Ontology Mapping**: 67.1%
- **Ontology Integrating**: 40.7%
- **Ontology Merging**: 33.9%
- **Ontology Aligning**: 26.1%
- **Other techniques**: 15.4% (including ontology learning, ontology matching, ontology mediation, ontology pruning, and ontology versioning)

**Figure 10. Which ontology techniques do respondents use?**

### Size of Ontologies
A quick look at real-world ontologies reveals the range of sizes being developed. For example, in life sciences, there are ontologies with as few as 195 concepts (protein-protein interaction) and 227 concepts (MGED), to larger ontologies with 2,222 concepts (BRENDA) and even 200,002 concepts (GO).

We asked each respondent to indicate the average size of the smallest, typical, and biggest ontologies they were working with. The results are as follows:

- **Smallest Ontologies**:
  - Less than 100 concepts: 72.9%
  - 100-1000 concepts: 20.5%
- **Typical Ontologies**:
  - 100-1000 concepts: 44.0%
  - Less than 100 concepts: 35.0%
- **Biggest Ontologies**:
  - 100-1000 concepts: 33.5%
  - 0-99 concepts: 17.9%
  - 1001-2000 concepts: 15.8%
  - More than 10,000 concepts: 16.6%

**Figure 11. Size of ontologies.**

### Production Timeframe
Each respondent was asked to indicate the estimated time before putting an ontology-based system into production. The results are as follows:

- **Currently active in development and installation**: 25.4%
- **Within 6 months**: 20.9%
- **Within 12 months**: 13.7%
- **Within 18 months**: 3.7%
- **Within 24 months**: 8.2%
- **No plans in the future**: 27.9%

### Conclusions
The Semantic Web vision: Where are we? Where are we heading? While some believe the Semantic Web is just research, it is already in use and starting to reach the market. This study provides a fundamental checkpoint to frame the current status and trends in the Semantic Web. It shows that the Semantic Web does not require complex ontologies; in fact, the majority of ontologies developed are small. It also demonstrates that the Semantic Web can achieve important objectives like data-sharing and data-integration using just RDF alone. Respondents primarily use ontologies to share a common understanding of the structure of information among people or software agents. Additionally, 70% of those working on the Semantic Web are committed to deploying real-world systems within the next two years.
