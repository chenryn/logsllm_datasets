I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that my query is not a duplicate. When it comes to Node.js servers, Express.js now faces significant competition in terms of performance. According to recent benchmarks, alternatives such as Micro, Connect, and Fastify demonstrate superior speed and efficiency compared to Express.js.

Are there any plans for Next.js to adopt one of these more performant alternatives to Express.js?
