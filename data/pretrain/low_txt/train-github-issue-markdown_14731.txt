In one of our screens, we are using a Material Scaffold without an AppBar. The body of the scaffold contains a `ListView` that includes standard Flutter widgets and a `WebView`. This `ListView` is wrapped in a `SafeArea`.

When scrolling up, as expected, the standard Flutter widgets do not appear behind the status bar. However, on iOS, the `WebView` is visible below the status bar. It seems that the padding provided by `SafeArea` does not apply to `WebView`/`PlatformView` on iOS.

I have created a simplified version to demonstrate this issue, which you can see in the attached GIF:

Here is the output of `flutter doctor -v` for reference:

This issue appears to be specific to the `WebView` on iOS, and it would be helpful if there were any known workarounds or fixes available.
