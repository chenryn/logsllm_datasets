### ATT&CK Technique: Restrict Library Loading (ID: M1044)

**Description:**
Restricting the loading of remote Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) is a security measure to prevent malicious code from being loaded into a system. This technique is particularly useful in mitigating DLL hijacking and other similar attacks.

**Implementation:**

1. **Default Configuration:**
   - In Windows Server 2012 and later versions, the restriction on loading remote DLLs is enabled by default.
   - For older systems such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, this feature can be enabled through a patch.

2. **Safe DLL Search Mode:**
   - Enabling Safe DLL Search Mode ensures that the system searches for DLLs in more secure directories (e.g., `%SYSTEMROOT%`) before looking in less secure directories (e.g., a user's home directory).
   - This can be configured via Group Policy:
     - **Path:** `Computer Configuration > [Policies] > Administrative Templates > MSS (Legacy): MSS: (SafeDllSearchMode) Enable Safe DLL search mode.`
   - The associated Windows Registry key for this setting is located at:
     - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\SafeDLLSearchMode`

By implementing these measures, you can enhance the security of your system and reduce the risk of DLL-based attacks.
