### I. Introduction

The 5th Workshop on Recent Advances in Intrusion-Tolerant Systems (WRAITS 2011), held in conjunction with DSN 2011, aims to continue the collaborative discourse on the challenges and innovative solutions for building intrusion-tolerant systems.

Modern computer-based information systems are increasingly distributed and interconnected, both physically and semantically. This interconnectivity introduces vulnerabilities and weak points that can be exploited. Recent high-profile breaches, such as those at RSA and Sony's online gaming network, highlight the critical need for robust security measures.

Intrusion tolerance is based on the premise that design, implementation, and operational flaws are inevitable in modern systems. It acknowledges that it is impossible to completely prevent or accurately detect all attacks and intrusions. Instead, intrusion tolerance seeks to develop technologies and techniques that enable distributed and networked information systems to continue operating through such attacks, providing a certain level of service. Intrusion tolerance can be seen as an intersection of fault tolerance and security, with an emphasis on dynamic and adaptive behavior. Unlike fault tolerance, intrusion tolerance faces intelligent adversaries, making adaptation crucial for system survival.

Previous workshops have focused on intrusion tolerance technologies and established it as a practical discipline combining software engineering, adaptive system development, advanced reasoning and analysis, and coordination and control of distributed mechanisms and resources. This year’s workshop is particularly interested in evaluating intrusion tolerance and its overlap with emerging information technologies. Specifically, we aim to assess the assurance provided by intrusion tolerance technologies and explore how emerging technologies like Web 2.0, semantic web systems, cloud computing, and service-oriented architectures challenge or enhance intrusion tolerance.

### II. This Year’s Workshop

The 5th edition of WRAITS features a keynote address by Michel Cukier and a collection of seven research papers. The keynote discusses the analysis of cybersecurity data (e.g., incidents, intrusion detection system alerts, network flows, and malicious activity against honeypots) to evaluate the security of organizational networks.

**Key Papers:**

1. **Continuous Mission-Oriented Assessment (CMA) of Assurance:**
   - **Authors:** Hurley et al.
   - **Summary:** This paper presents an innovative approach to assess the assurance provided by intrusion-tolerant systems at runtime.

2. **Combining Intrusion Detection and Recovery for Enhancing System Dependability:**
   - **Authors:** Nagarajan et al.
   - **Summary:** This paper addresses the issue of choosing one intrusion tolerance scheme over another using a ROC curve-based approach that considers the cost of successful intrusions and breaches.

3. **Managing Business Health in the Presence of Malicious Attacks:**
   - **Authors:** Zonouz et al.
   - **Summary:** This paper uses a game-theoretic format to discuss the cost of managing enterprise systems in the presence of attacks.

4. **The Time-Free Approach to Byzantine Failure Detection in Dynamic Networks:**
   - **Authors:** Lima et al.
   - **Summary:** This paper explores the detection of corrupt behavior in applications deployed in wireless and ad-hoc networks.

5. **A Cloud-Based Intrusion Detection and Response System for Mobile Phones:**
   - **Authors:** Houmansadr et al.
   - **Summary:** This paper addresses the emerging threat of intrusions and attacks on mobile phones, using cloud computing concepts for detection.

6. **Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection in Software as a Service:**
   - **Authors:** Nascimento et al.
   - **Summary:** This paper discusses an n-gram-based anomaly detection technique for large web-based systems, which are becoming common in many enterprises.

7. **From Byzantine Fault Tolerance to Intrusion Tolerance:**
   - **Author:** Bessani
   - **Summary:** This paper traces the connections between Byzantine fault tolerance and intrusion tolerance.
