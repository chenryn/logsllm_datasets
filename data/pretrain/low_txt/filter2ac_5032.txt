To prevent the enumeration of administrator accounts during User Account Control (UAC) elevation, which can lead to the disclosure of account names, you can disable this feature by modifying a specific Registry key. The key is located at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\CredUI\EnumerateAdministrators`.

Alternatively, you can disable this setting through Group Policy:
1. Navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **[Policies]** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Credential User Interface**.
2. Locate and configure the policy **"Enumerate administrator accounts on elevation"**.

By disabling this setting, you can reduce the risk of account name disclosure during UAC elevation.
