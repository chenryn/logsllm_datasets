### 7.2.1 Router FIB Limitations

The distribution of prefix sizes is crucial because each routed prefix requires an entry in a router's Forwarding Information Base (FIB). There is a risk that allocating all unused prefixes could overflow the FIBs. Our estimates indicate that there are approximately 0.78 million prefixes of /24 or larger, including both routed and unrouted space. Currently, more than 0.5 million prefixes are already routed, although a significant fraction remains unused.

In 2007, Juniper [30] stated that its M120 and MX960 routers had FIB capacities of about 2 million IPv4 routes. It was also noted that IPv4 FIBs with up to 10 million entries are feasible within a few years if demand exists. Additionally, FIB compression techniques can reduce the size of FIBs [30]. This suggests that it will be feasible to use and route all 1.3 million available prefixes. Even if unused prefixes are further subdivided, routing them all appears feasible, though some existing routers may require upgrades.

### 7.2.2 Estimated Years of Supply

As of July 2014, approximately 5.5 /8 networks of unallocated addresses remained [1], equivalent to 350,000 /24 networks or 90 million addresses. If all 4.4 million routed but unused /24 subnets could be reallocated, /24 networks would be exhausted by 2024 under the current growth trend of 0.45 million /24 subnets per year. Unused routed IPv4 addresses would be exhausted by 2023 given the current growth rate of 170 million addresses per year.

However, these overall estimates mask regional differences. Table 6 shows the available space (unallocated space plus allocated publicly routed unused space based on our CR estimates), the current average growth rate over our measured time period, and the predicted year when supply will run out for each Regional Internet Registry (RIR). For most RIRs, the number of years of IP supply is equal to or smaller than the number of years of /24 network supply. This is due to similar or higher IP growth rates compared to /24 growth rates, combined with significant numbers of unused IPs in used /24s. RIPE is an exception, with similar growth rates for IPs and /24s and significant supply in already used blocks.

At current growth rates, ARIN and RIPE have 14+ years of IP supply left, while AfriNIC has only 8–9 years, and LACNIC and APNIC have only 2–4 years of supply left. Any future reallocations between RIRs to ease local pressures would change these numbers, of course.

It seems unlikely that the entire IPv4 address space will ever be completely utilized. If the overall utilization of routed /24 subnets remains below, say, 75%, the current growth rates suggest four years of remaining supply overall. In this case, regions with tight supply, such as APNIC and LACNIC, would be exhausted within one year. APNIC stands out because its IP growth rate is much higher than its /24 growth rate, with unused IPs in used /24s being depleted soon. We expect a slowdown, and Figure 6 suggests it may have already begun. An open question is the large amount of unrouted IPv4 space, much of which has not been routed for years. Unused parts of the unrouted space might provide a short-lived increase in IPv4 supply.

Over the next one to two years, we expect IPv4 exhaustion to be increasingly felt, resulting in a brief growth in the IPv4 address market. Most organizations holding unused addresses do so for operational reasons—such as allowing expansion or flexibility, or in one case, as a /8 darknet—but some may sell them if the market price rises sufficiently. The numbers in this paper may guide how long they can expect to hold onto these addresses, assuming the market will collapse once IPv6 is widely adopted. However, selling a large block of IPv4 addresses could delay the implementation of IPv6, prolonging the IPv4 market.

### 8. Conclusions and Future Work

Our key contribution is the description and demonstration of a new statistical capture-recapture technique for improved estimation of the true population of both observed and unobserved (yet still active) IPv4 addresses from diverse sources of active and passive measurement data. This technique refines our community’s understanding of IPv4 address space exhaustion and consequent incentives for IPv6 adoption.

Data from nine sources over the past three years suggests 5.9 million used /24 subnets and 740 million used IPv4 addresses. Yet, our CR technique indicates a significantly higher 1.2 billion IPv4 addresses in use across 6.3 million /24 subnets, with usage growing at around 0.45 million /24 subnets and 170 million IPv4 addresses per year. Asia and Europe have the highest numbers of used IP addresses, while Africa and South America show the fastest growth.

Based on the overall estimates, at best, unallocated plus routed but unused addresses will last until 2023. More likely, if only 75% of routed /24 subnets could ever be used, supply will be exhausted by 2018. Moreover, Asia and South America are the two "pressure points" that will experience a shortage of addresses within the next one or two years.

Previous sales of IP addresses saw prices ranging from US$8 to $17 per IP, depending on the size of the blocks sold [31, 32]. At an average price of US$10 per IP address, the 4.4 million routed unused /24 subnets have a value of over US$11 billion. However, only a small fraction of these may be sold, so even if prices rise substantially, the eventual market value is likely to be smaller.

Our ability to collect more IP data for validating or improving our estimates, or potentially detecting more hosts (e.g., private servers), is limited by common privacy restrictions. We plan to explore an enhanced method [33] for securely applying CR to multi-source measurement data without revealing which IPv4 addresses each source contains.
