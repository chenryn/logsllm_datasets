# SITCH: Inexpensive, Coordinated GSM Anomaly Detection

## About Me
- **2000**: Started my technology career (I can get paid for this??)
- **2003**: Began working with Linux
- Transitioned into information security through systems and network engineering, integration
- Specialized in security tools and integration (SIEM, HIDS, etc.)
- Currently: R&D

## About You
- Background in systems and network engineering
- Interested in GSM threat detection
- Tinfoil hat not required… but not unwelcome!

## What We’re Covering Today
- Why Care?
- Current Threat and Detection Landscape
- Project Goals
- SITCH: MkI
- SITCH: MkII
- Service Architecture
- Future Plans
- Prior Art
- Q&A

## Why Care?
- Invasions of privacy are bad, even when they’re unnoticed.
- Industrial espionage costs money and jobs.

## Terminology
- **Software Defined Radio (SDR)**: Using software to perform signal processing in concert with an adjustable-frequency RF receiver
- **ARFCN**: Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number
- **BTS**: Base Transceiver Station
- **CGI**: Cell Global ID (MCC + MNC + LAC + CI)
- **MCC**: Mobile Country Code
- **MNC**: Mobile Network Code
- **LAC**: Location Area Code
- **CI**: Cell ID
- **IMSI**: International Mobile Subscriber Identity

## GSM Addressing

## Threat and Detection Landscape
- **Malicious Devices**
- **Indicators of Attack**
- **Existing Detection Methods**

### Malicious Devices
- **Hacked Femtocell**: Trusted part of the provider’s network; your phone doesn’t know it’s evil.
- **Evil BTS**: Handset will automatically associate, unable to assert trustworthiness.

### Indicators of Attack
- ARFCN over threshold
- ARFCN outside forecast
- Unrecognized CGI
- Gratuitous BTS re-association
- BTS detected outside of range

### Existing Detection Methods
- **Commercial Options**:
  - Pwnie Express
  - Bastille Networks
- **Open Source**:
  - Fake BTS
  - AIMSICD
  - Femto Catcher

## Project Goals
- **Inexpensive**: What can I get for $100?
- **Small footprint, low power requirements** preferred
- **Functional Targets**: Indicators of Attack (IOA) coverage
- **Centrally managed software and configuration**

## Hardware Setup
- **Raspberry Pi 2**
- **Logarithmic Antenna**
- **Odroids C1+ and XU4**
- **Intel NUC**
- **Intel Edison**
- **GSM Modem**
- **RTL-SDR**

## SITCH
- **Situational Information from Telemetry and Correlated Heuristics**

## SITCH Sensor MkI
- **Coverage**:
  - ARFCN over threshold: YES
  - ARFCN outside of forecast: YES
  - Unrecognized CGI: NO
  - Gratuitous BTS re-association: NO
  - BTS detected outside of range: NO
- **Price**: ~$100
- **Releasing MkI?**: No

## What’s wrong with MkI?
- Start Demo Here!
  - Confirm device registration
  - Image download starts

## Deployment Pipeline
- **Service-Side Software**:
  - **Logstash**: Inbound Information Processing, Alert delivery
  - **Elasticsearch**: Scan document retention
  - **Carbon/Graphite**: Time-series database, Statistical analysis of time-series data
  - **Kibana**: Browse scans
  - **Tessera**: Dashboard for Graphite
  - **Graphite Beacon**: Alert Generation
  - **Vault**: Secret management
  - **Resin**: Software Deployment
  - **Slack**: Notifications

## SITCH Service Architecture
- **SITCH Intelligence Feed**:
  - **OpenCellID Database**: MCC, MNC, Lat, Lon, Range
  - **Twilio**: MCC, MNC, CarrierName

## SITCH Sensor MkII
- **Return to Demo!**
  - Slack alerts
  - Tessera graphs
  - Kibana scan search
  - Resin logs

## MkI, MkII Summary
- **Coverage**:
  - ARFCN over threshold: YES (MkI), YES (MkII)
  - ARFCN outside of forecast: YES (MkI), YES (MkII)
  - Unrecognized CGI: NO (MkI), YES (MkII)
  - Gratuitous BTS re-association: NO (MkI), YES (MkII)
  - BTS detected outside of range: NO (MkI), YES (MkII)
- **Price**: ~$100 (MkI), ~$150 (MkII)
