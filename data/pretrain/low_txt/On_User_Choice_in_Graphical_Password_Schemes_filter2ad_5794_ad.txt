# Memorability of Passwords Over Time

## Figure 7: Memorability versus Time Since Password Change
- **Y-Axis:** Correct Login Rate (%)
- **X-Axis:** Time Since Password Change (days)
- **Data Points:** Each point represents the average of 100 login attempts.

### Observations:
- The graph shows a decline in the correct login rate as the time since the password change increases.
- This suggests that users find it more difficult to remember their passwords over time.

## Figure 8: Memorability versus Time Since Last Login Attempt
- **Y-Axis:** Correct Login Rate (%)
- **X-Axis:** Time Since Last Login Attempt (days)
- **Data Points:** Each point represents the average of 90 login attempts.

### Observations:
- The graph indicates that the correct login rate decreases as the time since the last login attempt increases.
- This suggests that frequent use of a password helps in maintaining memorability.

## User Behavior and Password Memorability

One potential reason for the relative difficulty in remembering "Story" passwords is that many users did not follow the suggestion to create a story. Nearly 50% of Story users reported choosing no story, instead employing alternative strategies such as memorizing the order of selected images. This often led to incorrect password entries due to misordering. For example, over 75% of incorrect password entries in the Story scheme consisted of the correct images in the wrong order. This is supported by user feedback:

- "I had no problem remembering the four pictures, but the original order."
- "No story, though having one may have helped to remember the order of the pictures better."
- "I could not remember... but the third try I found a sequence that I could remember. Fish-woman-girl-corn, I would screw up the fish and corn order 50% of the time, but I knew they were the pictures."

### Recommendations:
- **Avoid Ordered Selections:** Graphical password schemes should avoid requiring users to remember an ordered selection of images. Instead, a selection of k images from distinct sets of n images (as in the Face scheme) is generally more memorable.
- **Emphasize the Importance of Stories:** If a scheme relies on ordered selections, the importance of creating a meaningful story should be emphasized, as semantic meaning can enhance memorability.

## Category Selection by Demographics

### Table 6: Category Selection by Gender in Story
- **Categories:** Pop, Female, Male, Animals, Food, Children, Men, Objects, Nature, Cars, Women, Sports
- **Gender Breakdown:** Female, Male

### Table 7: Category Selection by Race in Story
- **Categories:** Pop, Asian, Hispanic, White, Animals, Food, Children, Men, Objects, Nature, Cars, Women, Sports
- **Race Breakdown:** Asian, Hispanic, White

### Observations:
- There are significant differences in category selection based on gender and race.
- These biases can affect the security of the password system, as certain categories may be more predictable.

## Conclusion

The graphical password schemes studied have the property that the password space can be exhaustively searched if an offline search is possible. Therefore, any use of these schemes requires mediation and confirmation by a trusted online system. Our study quantifies factors relevant to the security of user-chosen graphical passwords and advises against the use of systems like PassfacesTM without mitigating the effects of attraction and race. For certain populations, no limit on incorrect password guesses would suffice to secure the system.

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Prohibit or Limit User Choice:** Restrict the types of passwords users can choose.
- **User Education:** Educate users on better password selection practices.
- **Bias-Resistant Images:** Select images less prone to biases.

The Story scheme, while more secure, has some memorability issues. Further studies are needed to confirm the usability and security of unordered image selection and other approaches.
