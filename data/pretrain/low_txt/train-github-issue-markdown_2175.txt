When using Atom (version 0.138.0, installed via a zip download) on a German Windows 7 system with a German keyboard layout, the backslash (`\`) is typically entered using the `AltGr`+`ÃŸ` key combination. However, in Atom, this key combination does not produce the backslash character; instead, the keypress is ignored. Similarly, the `AltGr`+`q` key combination, which normally produces the at symbol (`@`), is also not recognized by Atom.
