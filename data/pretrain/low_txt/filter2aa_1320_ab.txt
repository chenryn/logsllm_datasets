# Lateral Movement Techniques and Indicators

## Tools
- **PAExec**
- **RemCom**
- **rcmd**
- **xcmd**
- **Impacket wmiexec**

## Indicators
### Windows Event Log
- **Event ID 4624: Logon**
  - **Type 2 (Interactive Logon):** If the attacker explicitly provides a different credential using the `-u` switch, Windows treats this as an interactive logon on the remote system.
  - **Type 3 (Network Logon):** When valid credentials are used, the account logon and logon events discussed previously also apply to this attack vector. If the attacker uses the currently logged-on user’s credentials, Windows will record the access on the remote system with the event "Network logon."

- **Event ID 4648: A New Process Has Been Created**
  - On the system initiating the connection, when the `-u` switch is used, an event 4648 is recorded. This event shows the account initiating the use of the credential in the Subject section, the credential provided with the `-u` switch in the "Account Whose Credentials Were Used" section, and the remote system targeted in the "Target Server" section.

- **Event ID 4697: A Service Was Installed in the System**
  - The executable may be uploaded with a random or explicitly provided name, or the Service File Name may be PowerShell run with a long, Base64-encoded command. If enabled, this event will also be logged in the Security event log, recording the service being installed on the system.

- **Event ID 7045: A New Service Was Installed**
  - The creation of the service generates this event in the System event log, complete with the name of the service created (Service Name field) and the executable that was used to create it (Service File Name field).

- **Event ID 7036: A Service Was Started/Stopped**
  - When the session ends, you may see this event in the System event log showing the PSEXESVC service entering a stopped state.

### Registry
- **Key:** `NTUSER.DAT\Software\Sysinternals\PsExec`
  - Where it sets the `EulaAccepted` value to 1. This key is named `PsExec` even if the attacker named the tool something else in an attempt to conceal its execution.
  - Example: Renaming `PsExec` to `ps64.exe`. Instead of focusing on the process name, look for the command parameters and the parent/child process association.

### Windows Admin Shares
- Windows systems have hidden network shares that are accessible only to administrators (e.g., `C$`, `ADMIN$`, and `IPC$`). These provide the ability for remote file copy and other administrative functions.
- Telemetry patterns include the use of `cmd.exe` with the names of shares such as `localhost\ADMIN$` or `127.0.0.1\ADMIN$`.

## Definitions
- **Lateral Movement**: Refers to the various techniques attackers use to progressively spread through a network as they search for key assets and data. It is usually the second step in a cyberattack.

## PowerShell
### Description
- Any action that can be taken on a Windows system can be taken through PowerShell, without the need for additional malware to be installed.
- **WARNING!** PowerShell is one of the most useful tools in the administrator’s arsenal for daily administrative tasks, baselining, and incident handling. Just as attackers have scripts like Empire to help do their jobs, defenders have frameworks like Kansa to help do theirs.

### Security Measures
- **Group Policy Path**:
  - **Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows PowerShell**
    - **Module Logging**: Logs pipeline execution events.
    - **Script Block Logging**: Captures de-obfuscated commands sent to PowerShell.
    - **Transcription**: Captures PowerShell input and output.

### Windows Event Log
- **Location**: `%SystemRoot%\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell%4Operational`
- **Event ID 4103**: Includes the user context used to run the commands. The Hostname field will show “Console” if executed locally or will show if run from a remote system.
- **Event ID 4104**: Shows script block logging entries. Logs full details of each block only on first use to conserve space. Will show as a “Warning” level event if Microsoft deems the activity “Suspicious.”

### PowerShell History
- **Location**: `%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt`
- **WARNING!** Confirm the location on a system by running the `Get-PSReadLineOption` cmdlet and checking the `HistorySavePath`.
- **MaximumHistoryCount**: Shows the number of lines that will be stored in the `consoleHost_history.txt` file before it starts overwriting older entries (the default is 4096).

### Network Activity
- **PowerShell Remoting**: Uses WinRM to establish connections to remote machines. Detection methods for WinRM also apply to PowerShell Remoting. PowerShell encrypts all remoting commands with AES-256 after the initial authentication.
- **Outbound Restrictions**: Implement outbound restrictions to keep systems that don’t need to initiate outbound PowerShell Remoting sessions from initiating outbound connections on TCP ports 5985 and 5986.
- **Common Ports and Encrypted Communications**: Utilizing common ports (TCP 80, 443, etc.), encrypted communications, making infrequent connections, and requesting benign-looking URIs.
- **Example URI's**:
  - `/login/process.php`
  - `/admin/get.php`
  - `/news.php`
- **Launcher String**: The following launcher string, `powershell -noP -sta -w 1 -enc`, is present by default in Empire HTTP listeners. While the launcher string can be easily changed, it is commonly unaltered by attackers.

## Credential Theft
### Description
- Once a client system is compromised, attackers will set to work to collect credentials from that machine.
- **WARNING!** The credentials do not need to be full username and cleartext password pairs. Attackers can steal hashed representations of passwords, load them into memory, and allow Windows passthrough authentication to handle authentication to other systems as an arbitrary user through pass-the-hash attacks.

### Indicators
- **Windows Event Logs**
  - **Domain Controllers**
    - **Event ID 4768**: Issuance of a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) indicates that a particular user account was authenticated by the domain controller.
    - **Event ID 4769**: A service ticket was issued to a particular user account for a specified resource. This event shows the source IP of the system that made the request, the user account used, and the service to be accessed.
    - **Event ID 4776**: NTLM-based authentication has occurred. While less common in a domain environment, NTLM may still be used for authentication.
    - **Event ID 4720**: A new account is created, either for a domain account or on the local system for a local account.
  - **Workstations**
    - **Event ID 4624**: A logon to a system has occurred. Type 2 indicates an interactive (local) logon, while Type 3 indicates a remote or network logon.
    - **Event ID 4625**: A failed logon attempt.
    - **Event ID 4672**: Recorded when certain privileges associated with elevated or administrator access are granted to a logon.
    - **Event ID 4776**: An NTLM-based authentication has occurred. On a non-domain controller, this indicates the use of a local user account.
    - **Event ID 4634/4647**: User logoff is recorded by Event ID 4634 or Event ID 4647.
    - **Event ID 5140**: A network share object was accessed, showing when a shared folder or other shared object is accessed.

### Registry
- **Key**: `HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript`
  - Registers the file name for the next stage malware.
