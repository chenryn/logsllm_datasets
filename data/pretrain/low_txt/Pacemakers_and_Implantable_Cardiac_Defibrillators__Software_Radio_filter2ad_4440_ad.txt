### Experiment: Changing the Patient Name on the ICD

To test the ability to change the patient name stored on the Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD), we used a programmer to replay traces. After an average of ten replays, more than one of which may have succeeded, we confirmed the successful change of the patient name using the programmer. We repeated this experiment several times, each time changing the name to a different value and confirming the change.

### Setting the ICD’s Clock

The ICD and the programmer each have their own clocks. The ICD's clock is used to record timestamps in its event log and can be set from a menu on the programmer. Using GNU Radio, we replayed traces in which the programmer sets the time or date on the ICD. We then confirmed in a new programming session that the ICD's clock had been successfully set. As with the patient name change, this attack succeeded after an average of ten replays, more than one of which may have succeeded.

### Changing Therapies

Therapies are the ICD’s responses to cardiac events. A commercial programmer can enable, personalize, or disable these therapies based on the patient's medical needs. We used GNU Radio to replay captures in which the programmer turns off therapies. With therapies turned off, the ICD does not respond to potentially dangerous cardiac conditions. After 24 replay attempts, more than one of which may have succeeded, we confirmed in a new programming session that all previously enabled therapies had been successfully disabled.

### Inducing Fibrillation

During implantation surgery, it is common for a physician to test the newly implanted ICD to ensure it can sense and appropriately treat ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib). The ICD has several testing modes to induce V-Fib, typically conducted with cardiologists standing by. After a physician puts the programmer in EP study mode, sets parameters, and confirms the study, the programmer sends commands to apply a low-energy shock to the patient's heart, inducing V-Fib. If automatic therapies are enabled, the ICD should immediately detect and treat the fibrillation.

We introduced a 100 Ω resistor between two defibrillation ports to measure the voltage applied during a command shock. Using our commercial programmer, we sent a 1.0 J shock across the resistor and measured the pulse's peak voltage at an average of 138.4 V over three trials. We then replayed the EP study command sequence via software radio. At least three of 30 replay attempts succeeded, causing similar voltage spikes averaging 137.7 V. We confirmed the ICD's last high-voltage therapy field changed to reflect the date and time of our last successful attack. We triggered command shocks even after disabling all automatic therapies.

### Power Denial of Service Attack

Our experiments suggest that the ICD could be forced into a mode of continuous wireless communication. A strong magnetic field causes the ICD to transmit telemetry continually, and the ICD responds to RF commands without a nearby magnet. While we have not measured the power consumption, it is possible that these operations decrease battery life faster than normal operation.

### Other Attack Vectors

As noted in our earlier work, there may be other attack vectors against IMDs, such as insecure software updates or buffer overflow vulnerabilities. We do not experiment with these in this work but note that such vulnerabilities could allow further adversarial control over the state and operation of an IMD.

### Zero-Power and Sensible Defenses for IMD Security and Privacy

Providing security and privacy for an IMD involves health risk factors and resource constraints. Traditional approaches could introduce new hazards. For instance, protecting an IMD with a cryptographic key may provide security but could hinder treatment in emergencies. Another risk is excessive power consumption by mechanisms not needed for the device's primary function. Effective security and privacy mechanisms should not drain the device's battery or introduce new failure modes.

Our design goals for zero-power approaches include:
1. Preventing or deterring attacks by both malicious outsiders and insiders.
2. Drawing no power from the primary battery to prevent denial of service attacks.
3. Making security-sensitive events effortlessly detectable by the patient.

### Zero-Power Notification

Our zero-power notification alerts patients to potentially malicious activities by audibly warning them. Our prototype, WISPer, uses a piezo-element driven by harvested RF energy. It chirps when receiving wireless requests, informing the patient of the interaction. Evaluation showed that the buzzing volume peaked at 67 dB SPL from a distance of 1 m, making it easily audible.

### Zero-Power Authentication

Our second defense implements a zero-power method for the IMD to verify it is communicating with a real commercial programmer. The approach uses a challenge-response protocol based on RC5-32/12/16. The programmer transmits a request, the WISP responds with its identity and a nonce, and the programmer returns a response. The WISP verifies the response and sets a GPIO high, indicating successful authentication.

### Sensible Key Exchange

Sensible key exchange combines techniques from zero-power notification and authentication for vibration-based key distribution, providing audible and tactile feedback to the patient. This approach ensures that the patient is aware of the key exchange process.

### Conclusion

While our prototypes show the feasibility of zero-power defenses, they are not final designs. Our research provides a foundation for creating, evaluating, and implementing new defensive mechanisms for future IMD designs.
