### Minimal Example of the Problem

- **App Component**: This component uses the `ContenteditableModel` component, which allows editing of a bound property. Changes are propagated to the parent component via two-way data binding (using `[( )]` syntax).
- **ContenteditableModel Component**: This component is capable of modifying the `text` property in the `App` component.
- **Expected Behavior**: The `OnChanges` lifecycle hook in the `App` component should be triggered when the `text` property is updated.

**Issue**: The `OnChanges` hook is not being executed in the `App` component, even though the `{{text}}` value is changing correctly.
