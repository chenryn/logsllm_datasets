2. **Recovery**:
   - **Message**: "SW_DA-1-RECOVERY~ 1-Alert: Dual-active condition detected: Starting recovery-mode all non-VSL interfaces have been shut down"
   - **Description**: A dual-active situation has occurred due to the VSL going down. The VSL has become inactive, and both chassis have taken over the role of the active virtual switch. To fix this condition, the standby virtual switch has become active and taken control of the network. All non-VSL interfaces on the original active virtual switch will be errdisabled or shut down.
   - **Category**: dual-active
   - **Action**: Attempt to determine the reason why the VSL has gone down and correct it. Once the VSL has been re-established, the original active virtual switch will reload.
   - **Note**: This message indicates that the system has entered recovery mode. This happens when the VSL links between the active and standby switches go down. VSL links going down will cause the active switch to shut down all physical interfaces and loopback interfaces except for the interfaces configured for VSL. Physical interfaces are errdisabled while loopback interfaces are operationally down. Any new interfaces configured for VSL will be removed from the errdisable state. Any new interfaces unconfigured from being VSL will be put in the errdisable state.
