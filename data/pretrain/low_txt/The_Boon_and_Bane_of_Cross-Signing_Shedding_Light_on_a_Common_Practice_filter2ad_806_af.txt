### OpenSSL and TLS Applications
The integration of OpenSSL should not necessitate any modifications to applications that use TLS. TrustBase [74] is a potential candidate for this purpose. Recent research also highlights the effectiveness of local revocation lists, such as OneCRL, even for the efficient revocation of leaf certificates [54]. Adopting such approaches as the default would significantly enhance the safety and robustness of the entire Web PKI.

### 7. Related Work
While there is extensive literature on various aspects of the PKI [2, 46, 56, 81, 87] and the TLS/HTTPS ecosystem [34, 48], most studies do not address or examine cross-signing. In their 2013 Systematization of Knowledge paper, Clark and Oorschot provide a comprehensive review of the issues in the Web PKI [28]. They note the problem of revoking CA certificates and mention that some CA certificates may lack the necessary information for revocation checks. Durumeric et al. observed a high occurrence of cross-signing among CA certificates in 2013 [35], but their analysis was limited to a general overview and a brief statement on the impact on root store coverage. Acer et al. [1] analyzed certificate validation errors in Chrome and found that missing cross-sign certificates in a presented certificate path can cause some errors, underscoring the importance of cross-signing for establishing trust in widely trusted stores. Roosa et al. [80] identified cross-signing as a mechanism that introduces intransparency in PKI systems, as CAs do not disclose cross-sign relationships when applying for inclusion in a root store. Since April 2018, CAs must report all intermediates that provide a path to a root in Mozilla’s root store and are not constrained to specific domain subtrees [60, 61]. Casola et al. [24] developed a method for CAs to automatically check policy compatibility before cross-signing. Our work goes beyond policies and provides guidelines for the safe operation of cross-signs.

### 8. Conclusion
Our longitudinal study demonstrates that cross-signing is a common practice in the Web PKI. We provide a classification of possible cross-sign patterns and analyze their use and effects on real-world communications. Cross-signs are used to bootstrap trust in new CAs, which played a significant role in the success of Let's Encrypt. They also improve trust-store coverage, allowing CAs to gain trust in stores where they are not directly trusted. Additionally, cross-signing facilitates a smooth transition to newer cryptographic algorithms, as seen in the case of SHA-2.

However, our work also highlights the challenges introduced by cross-signing, particularly the creation of unwanted trust paths. Cross-signing complicates the already error-prone process of certificate revocation, leading to numerous incomplete revocations. We show that introducing new cross-signs requires extensive checks to prevent accidental breaches of PKI boundaries. Cross-signing also makes it difficult for observers to determine if trust paths are legitimate or just remnants of past contractual relationships between CAs.

Based on our findings, we propose new best practices for cross-signing. We hope to initiate and guide discussions on new rules that preserve the benefits of cross-signing while mitigating its risks.

### A. Ethics of Data Collection
Our passive data collection effort has been approved by the respective responsible parties at each contributing institution. The data collection leverages existing network security monitoring infrastructure at the contributing institutions, run by their network security teams. We provide them with a short script (which they can examine) that extracts TLS data. The script only extracts non-privacy-sensitive data or anonymizes it before sending it to us. For example, it does not include client IP addresses; instead, it contains a seeded hash of the concatenation of the client and server IP addresses. The seed is site-specific and unknown to us. This approach allows us to track repeated connections without enabling us to track which sites a single client accesses. Additionally, we do not collect client certificates; we only collect certificates sent by Internet servers to clients.

### B. Details and Further Examples

#### B.1 WoSign & StartCom: Early Cross-Signing
As noted in Section 5.1.1, StartCom began cross-signing WoSign certificates years before being acquired by them, and cross-signing continued after the acquisition. Specifically, StartCom Certificate Authority cross-signed the Certification Authority of WoSign in 2006, but revoked the cross-signs in March 2017. However, a further cross-sign of WoSign CA Limited was not revoked until 2018. StartCom also issued the intermediate WoSign eCommerce Services Limited, which was cross-signed by Certplus in 2011. These cross-signs did not create undesired trust paths due to constraints by Mozilla and Google, but they indicate a close business relationship between StartCom and WoSign years before the acquisition in 2015.

This behavior continued post-acquisition: StartCom Certification Authority issued and Certification Authority of WoSign G2 cross-signed the new intermediate StartCom Class 3 OV Server CA.

#### B.2 Bootstrapping: Further Examples
Cross-signing enables CAs to bootstrap trust in certificates while waiting for their inclusion in root stores. We discussed several cases in Section 5.3. Here is a full list of CAs for which we identified bootstrapping cases: Comodo, USERTrust, DigiCert, VeriSign, Verizon, Cybertrust, Let's Encrypt, IdenTrust, WoSign, AffirmTrust, GlobalSign, Actalis, Starfield Services, Amazon, T-Systems, WellsSecure, Dell Inc., SECOM, TeliaSonera, Unizeto, CertiPath, Certipost, SCEE, Chunghwa Telecom, Carillon Information Security Inc., ORC PKI, TAIWAN-CA.COM Inc., Hongkong Post ARGE DATEN - Austrian Society for Data Protection, CNNIC, the U.S. Government, the Swiss Government, and the Belgium Root.

#### B.3 Expanding Trust and Alternative Paths: Further Examples and Comodo Details
As noted in Section 5.4, some root certificates are included in only some root stores, limiting the trust provided by a single issuer. Cross-signs by selected CA certificates can close these gaps by providing trust paths to uncovered root stores.

**Increasing Trust Store Coverage:** We found three XS-Certs that use cross-signing to increase their root store coverage. The intermediate XS-Certs Servision Inc., XiPS, and KAGOYA JAPAN Inc. were issued by GoDaddy’s ValiCert Class 1 Policy Validation Authority in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. The ValiCert certificate provides trust paths for Mozilla, Google, and Apple, but not for Microsoft’s root store. To expand the root store coverage, all three intermediates were cross-signed by the broadly trusted Security Communication RootCA1 of SECOM at the end of 2012, which validated issued certificates for the Microsoft ecosystem as well.

Furthermore, the ValiCert root was removed from the root stores of Mozilla and Google around 2014 and 2015 due to the deprecation of certificates using RSA keys with less than 2048 bits [11, 12]. The intermediates, however, remained trusted due to the cross-sign by SECOM. The same applies to Apple’s root store, which removed the ValiCert root in 2018. Thus, cross-signing not only provides broad trust coverage but also keeps intermediates operable in the face of trust-store removals of their issuers.

Unizeto not only cross-signed WoSign roots (cf. Section 5.1.1) but also provided SSL.com with trust on Apple devices. Specifically, Certum Trusted Network CA cross-signed the roots SSL.com Root CA RSA and SSL.com RV Root CA RSA R2. Both roots, created in 2016 and 2017, respectively, were not included in root stores before 2018. The cross-signs by Certum in 2018 extended trust to Apple’s root store, which did not include the roots before 2019.

**Fall-Back Trust Paths:** Cross-signs that increase root store coverage often also establish fall-back trust paths, providing alternatives for unexpected revocations. The SECOM cross-sign (Section B.3.1) provided trust paths for certificates of Servision, XiPS, and KAGOYA JAPAN after the originally issuing ValiCert certificate was removed from Mozilla and Google root stores due to its 1024-bit RSA key [11, 12].

Entrust maintains a small internal cross-signing interconnection to establish fall-back trust paths for already broadly trusted roots: Entrust.net Secure Server Certificate Authority cross-signed Entrust.net Certificate Authority and Entrust Root Certificate Authority. The latter furthermore cross-signed Entrust Root Certificate Authority - G2 and Entrust Root Certificate Authority - EC1. Beyond these internal cross-signs, Entrust also received external cross-signs by today’s members of the Digicert group (cf. Sections B.5.2).

Apart from its cross-signing to bootstrap new roots (cf. Section 5.3.3), GoDaddy also maintains internal XS-Certs which establish alternative trust paths for already well-trusted roots. In 2009, the bootstrapped Starfield Class 2 CA cross-signed Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority - G2. Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority added another cross-sign to this root XS-Cert. In 2014, Starfield Class 2 CA also cross-signed Starfield Root Certificate Authority - G2. Similarly in 2014, Go Daddy Class 2 Certification Authority cross-signed Go Daddy Root Certificate Authority - G2, establishing alternative trust paths. Beyond these internal cross-signs, Go Daddy’s ValiCert Class 1 Policy Validation cross-signed SECOM Security Communication Root CA1, again establishing fall-back trust paths for an already well-trusted root.

GlobalSign also creates fall-back trust paths via cross-signing. Besides its incompletely revoked XS-Cert GlobalSign Extended Validation CA - SHA256 - G2 (cf. Section 5.1.3), GlobalSign maintains four still valid cross-signs: AlphaSSL CA - SHA256 - G2, GlobalSign Organization Validation CA - SHA256 - G2, GlobalSign Domain Validation CA - SHA256 - G2, and GlobalSign CloudSSL CA - SHA256 - G3. The two cross-signing roots, GlobalSign Root CA and GlobalSign, provide broad trust coverage individually; hence the cross-signs establish alternative paths.

**B.3.3 Comodo’s Trust-Enlarging and Fall-Back Cross-Signs:** Comodo extensively uses cross-signing to interlink root certificates within and between its subsidiary CAs, as visualized in Figure 4. This interlinking is established by a few certificates that cross-sign several others. The broadly trusted AddTrust External CA Root cross-signed various root certificates of USERTrust and Comodo, establishing fall-back trust paths for them. Almost all these cross-signs also enlarge the root store coverage, compensating for a limited root store coverage of the cross-signed root. This effect is especially large for USERTRUST UTN-USERFirst-Client Authentication and USERTrust UTN-USERFirst-Object, as it adds trust paths for Mozilla, Android, and the grid PKI beyond the original coverage of only iOS, OSX, and Microsoft. Contrarily, COMODO ECC Certification Authority and COMODO RSA Certification Authority merely obtain new trust by the grid PKI. Nevertheless, they still benefit from the fall-back trust paths. Before USERTrust UTN-USERFirst-Hardware and USERTrust UTN - DATACorp SGC ceased their operation, their mutual cross-signs with AddTrust External CA Root also provided the latter with fall-back trust paths, naturally expanding to all its cross-signs. Similarly, the broadly trusted AAA Certificate Services root10 cross-signed three USERTrust roots, providing each with a further fall-back trust path.

Comodo’s intermediate XS-Certs COMODO EV SSL CA and COMODO EV SGC CA also benefit from fall-back trust paths established through cross-signing. Comodo’s very first intermediate XS-Cert, however, is LiteSSL CA, which Comodo created for Positive Software Corporation after acquiring it in 2005.

#### B.4 Switching Trust Anchor
The expiry of or changing trust in certificates requires CAs to establish new trust paths to keep affected but still trustworthy certificates valid. For example, if the issuing certificate will soon expire, the owner of an intermediate may request a different CA to issue a longer-lasting intermediate with the same subject and public key. Remember that we require certificates of a cross-sign to overlap by at least 121 days (cf. Section 3.1) and otherwise consider it as re-issuance. However, some trust changes happen years before the expiry of the original certificates:

Symantec’s GeoTrust Global CA issued an intermediate for UniCredit in 2012 and renewed it in 2015. In October 2016, Actalis cross-signed this certificate. However, the older GeoTrust-issued certs were revoked the day after this issuance, rendering this a switch to a new root rather than a typical cross-sign.

Similarly, the Spanish Autoridad de Certificacion Firmaprofesional CIF A62634068 moved from a soon expiring to a more recent root. Sertifitseerimiskeskus (SK), the partner of Estonia for ID products, used cross-signing to switch its AS Sertifitseerimiskeskus root (expiring in 2016) to the new EE Certification Centre. Interestingly, the cross-sign includes a SHA3 intermediate since 2015 but no cross-sign with SHA2, limiting clients without SHA3 capabilities to the use of a SHA1 trust path element.

#### B.5 Ownership Changes: Further Examples and Digicert Details
In Section 5.6, we showed that cross-signs frequently outlive ownership changes, which may lead to a lack of awareness of the cross-signs and oversight of problems. We provide further examples and a detailed view on the Digicert cases in the following.

**B.5.1 Entrust Datacard:** Entrust Datacard is another example with cross-signs that span an ownership change. In 2016, Entrust Datacard obtained control of Affirmtrust Networking and Affirmtrust Commercial, which were cross-signed by SwissSign Gold CA - G2.
