### Experience Analysis and Ontology Development

Experience analysis should provide valuable insights into the social and strategic aspects that are pertinent to the creation and deployment of formal ontologies. Additionally, it should offer useful criteria and methods for evaluating the effectiveness of ontologies in various applications.
