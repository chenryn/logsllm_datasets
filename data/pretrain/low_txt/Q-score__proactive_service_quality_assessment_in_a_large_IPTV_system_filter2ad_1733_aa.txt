## Abstract
In large-scale IPTV systems, maintaining high service quality while offering a wide variety of features is crucial. Traditional methods for assessing Quality of Experience (QoE) are often limited by the lack of direct metrics and delayed, noisy user feedback. This paper introduces Q-score, a proactive service quality assessment framework that accurately learns a small set of performance indicators most relevant to user-perceived service quality and infers service quality in a single score. Using data from a commercial IPTV provider, we show that Q-score can predict 60% of service problems with only 0.1% false positives. Through Q-score, we gain insights into various types of service issues, identify opportunities for proactive detection, and optimize customer care workforce allocation.

## 1. Introduction
IPTV technologies are transforming the global television industry by enabling new operators to provide innovative IP-based services. However, ensuring that IPTV services deliver a QoE equal to or better than traditional TV services is challenging. Traditional QoE assessment methods, such as subjective evaluations in controlled environments, are expensive and unreliable. User feedback, while valuable, is often incomplete, delayed, and biased towards negative experiences.

Operators need a proactive approach to comprehensively assess user QoE. This visibility is critical for detecting and responding to service issues before they escalate. Existing network monitoring tools do not directly measure customer perception of TV service quality, and deploying video monitoring to millions of customers is prohibitively expensive.

In this paper, we propose Q-score, a framework for proactive QoE assessment. Q-score uses network performance metrics to infer user QoE. It consists of two key components: (i) offline learning of the association between QoE and network performance metrics, and (ii) online computation of a single QoE score for individual users or groups. Q-score provides timely alerts, often several hours before users report issues to call centers.

### Q-score Design Challenges
1. **Associating QoE with Network Performance**: There is no natural association between network-level performance indicators and user-perceived QoE. Even domain experts find it challenging to identify key performance indicators.
2. **Lack of Timely, High-Quality User Feedback**: User feedback is inherently noisy, incomplete, and delayed, making it difficult to use for QoE assessment.
3. **Large Volume of Diverse Performance Measurements**: Network performance measurements vary in granularity and type, posing technical challenges in inferring QoE.

### Our Contributions
1. **Design and Implementation**: We design and implement a prototype Q-score system using a multi-scale spatio-temporal statistical mining technique to compute a single QoE score.
2. **Evaluation**: We evaluate Q-score using data from a large commercial IPTV provider and show it can predict 60% of customer service calls with 0.1% false positives.
3. **Applications**: We create three applications: (i) identifying important Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) associated with QoE, (ii) predicting poor QoE and generating alerts, and (iii) effective dimensioning of the customer care workforce.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 IPTV Service Architecture
Figure 1 provides an overview of an IPTV system. The architecture is hierarchical, with video content delivered via IP multicast from servers in the provider's core network to Set-Top Boxes (STBs) in home networks. Content is encoded, packetized, and sent through routers and switches in Intermediate Offices (IOs), Central Offices (COs), and Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) before reaching the STB.

### 2.2 Data Sets
We use data from a large U.S. IPTV provider, covering four time zones. The dataset includes:
- **Network Performance Indicators**: Collected from routers, switches, and STBs.
- **User Activity Indicators**: Logs of user activities such as power on/off, channel changes, and video stream control.
- **User Feedback**: Customer trouble tickets, anonymized to preserve privacy.

## 3. Q-score Design
### 3.1 Offline Learning Component
The offline component learns the association between QoE and network performance metrics using historical data. This involves feature extraction, normalization, and regression analysis.

### 3.2 Online Monitoring Component
The online component continuously monitors network performance and computes Q-scores for individual users or groups. It aggregates features and feedback over time and space to generate accurate QoE scores.

## 4. Performance Evaluation
Using data from a commercial IPTV provider, we show that Q-score can predict 60% of customer service calls with 0.1% false positives. This demonstrates the effectiveness of Q-score in proactive QoE assessment.

## 5. Applications
### 5.1 Identifying KPIs
Q-score identifies key performance indicators that are statistically associated with QoE.

### 5.2 Predicting Poor QoE
Q-score predicts poor QoE and generates alerts to the operations team, allowing for rapid response.

### 5.3 Workforce Allocation
Q-score helps in dynamically allocating repair personnel to service regions experiencing issues, improving root-cause diagnosis and rapid repair.

## 6. Related Work
We review related work in QoE assessment and highlight the unique contributions of Q-score.

## 7. Conclusions
Q-score provides a proactive and scalable solution for QoE assessment in large IPTV systems. It offers significant improvements in detecting and responding to service issues, leading to a better overall customer experience.
