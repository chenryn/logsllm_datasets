### Figure 13: TCP Performance Across Different Zones

**Figure 13: TCP performance on each zone across a 20 km stretch of road for three monitored networks.**

- **Networks**: NetA, NetB, NetC
- **Throughput (kbps)**:
  - 2000
  - 1500
  - 1000
  - 500
  - 0
- **Zones**: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45

In the absence of any knowledge about which network provides the best performance at the current location, clients with multi-SIM phones would either have to select a network randomly or conduct measurements to determine the network quality for all available networks.

### Location-Specific Information and Its Applications

The second application that can benefit from location-specific information is a Multi-Access Router (MAR) [4], a multi-network Internet gateway mounted on a vehicle that can aggregate bandwidth from all simultaneously connected networks. The scheduler in MAR stripes traffic flows to different network interfaces. While the authors in [4] suggest using location-specific network performance information to further optimize performance by intelligently mapping data requests to interfaces based on locality, we highlight the benefits of such a scheme over a simple multi-interface striping algorithm where all currently active requests from different clients are mapped onto different cellular networks in a round-robin fashion.

### Experiment Scenario

To illustrate the benefits of coarse throughput estimates for the above two applications, we consider the following experiment scenario:

- **Client**: Either a MAR gateway or a Multi-SIM phone.
- **Activity**: Placing back-to-back requests for a set of pages from the Internet while driving on a road stretch depicted in Figure 12.
- **Web Pages**: 
  - A pool of 1000 web pages with sizes between 2.8 KBytes and 3.2 MBytes, generated using SURGE [28].
  - Popular Web sites, downloading pages to a depth of 1 from their starting page.
- **Experiment Setup**: The car runs on the same road segment (Table 2) multiple times during the experiment.
- **Comparison**: Performance between a system where data is requested in a round-robin fashion on each network versus a system with a monitoring agent that uses GPS to determine the vehicle's location and selects the best network to minimize download latency.

### Results: Multi-SIM Improvements

- **HTTP Latency**: Averaged over ten runs (Table 6).
- **Improvement**: Decrease in HTTP latency by 30% by selecting the best-performing interface at a given location.
- **Web Page Latency**: Shown in Figure 14(a).
  - **Maximum Improvement**: Amazon.com webpage (32% improvement).
  - **Minimum Improvement**: Microsoft.com webpage (13% improvement).

### Results: MAR Performance Improvements

- **Download Latency**: Comparison between the two schemes.
- **Measurement**: Running the car with a MAR client with 3 interfaces on a 2.4 km segment of road (from zone 10 to 15 from Figure 13).
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **MAR-WiScape**: Uses network performance information.
  - **MAR-RR**: Maps client requests to interfaces in a throughput-weighted Round Robin fashion.
- **Improvement**: Decrease in HTTP latency by 32% compared to MAR-RR (Table 6, last two columns).

- **Well-Known Web Pages**: Results in Figure 14(b).
  - **Locality-Aware Scheme**: Improves performance by 37% over a naive round-robin scheme.

### Considerations and Future Work

- **Explicit Measurements**: Applications can estimate network performance through explicit measurements, resulting in steady measurement overhead on all network interfaces.
- **Client Traffic**: Applications like MAR would need to stop all client traffic, potentially hampering performance.
- **Client-Sourcing Base Approach**: Gathers data ahead of time and makes it available to potential clients at a low overhead.
- **System-Level Issues**: Energy efficiency, time to switch between links, and presence of client think time were not accounted for in the performance calculations.
- **Future Research**: Investigate the impact of these issues on achievable benefits.
