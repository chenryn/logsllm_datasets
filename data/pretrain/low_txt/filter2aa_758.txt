# Introduction to Hardware Hacking

### Why Hardware Hacking?
Hardware hacking often receives less attention than computer hacking, and I aim to change that. Specifically, I want to improve the reputation of hardware hacking by highlighting its value and accessibility.

### Definition of a Hardware Hack
A hardware hack is a creative modification or fix made to a piece of equipment that enhances its performance or enables it to perform functions for which it was not originally designed. The results of the hack do not need to be strictly 'useful' in the conventional sense. The term 'hack' can be used as both a noun and a verb:
- **Noun**: "That hack you made to your toaster was great!"
- **Verb**: "Let's hack your brother's TV set tonight to only tune in channel 13!"

### Why is Hardware Hacking Easier than Software Hacking?
When you purchase a piece of hardware, such as a toaster, you can open it up to see how it works. Repair manuals are often available, and your skills can benefit those around you by fixing household items. In contrast, when you buy commercial software, you cannot examine its inner workings because you only have access to the executable file, not the source code. This limits your ability to understand and modify its behavior. Open-source software is an exception to this rule.

### EE Basics
#### Passive and Active Parts
- **Passive Parts**
  - Resistors: Limit the flow of electrical current. Measured in Ohms. Follows the equation V = I x R.
  - Capacitors: Store electrical energy in the form of an electric field. Measured in Farads. Voltage, Current, and Capacitance follow the equation I = C dv/dt. Can be polarized and used to filter noisy circuits.
  - Inductors: Store energy in the form of a magnetic field. Measured in Henries. Voltage, Current, and Inductance follow the equation V = L di/dt. Used to filter out Radio Frequency (RF) Interference.
  - Transformers: Transfer energy via a magnetic field. The turns ratio determines the AC voltage. Used for signal isolation and voltage stepping.
- **Active Parts**
  - Transistors: Act as switches. Two basic types: Bipolar (current-controlled) and MOS (voltage-controlled).
  - Diodes: One-way gates. Types include standard, Schottky, and Zener. Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are also diodes with a forward voltage drop of 1.7V and above.
  - Integrated Circuits: Composed of many transistors.

### Cracking the Case
#### Tools and Techniques
- **Tools**
  - Small screwdrivers (Philips and flat head)
  - Torx drivers (star-shaped heads)
  - Hex drivers (hexagon-shaped heads)
  - Tweezers (for retrieving dropped screws and prying)
  - Dental picks and razor blades
- **Common Fasteners**
  - Screws
  - Plastic snaps
  - Glue
  - Double-sided tape
- **Tips for Opening Cases**
  - Clear a table top and use white paper to see dropped screws.
  - Ensure the device is unplugged and batteries are removed.
  - Carefully remove all screws, noting their locations on a diagram.
  - Gently pry open seams, looking for hidden fasteners.
  - Use a static wrist strap or touch a grounded object to prevent static damage to electronics.

### Building Circuits
#### Reading Schematic Diagrams
- Understand part references, power supply, ground, net names, and signal connections.

#### Breadboarding
- Utilize a plug board and 24-gauge solid core wire to build circuits without soldering. Useful for small, non-RF circuits.

#### Soldering
- **Irons**
  - Electric
  - Butane
- **Solder**
  - Tin/Lead
  - Lead-free
  - Silver
- **Accessories**
  - Tip cleaner (sponge or copper sponge)
  - Flux (rosin, water-soluble, no-clean)
  - Solder remover (wicks and suckers)

#### Perf Board
- A fiberglass board with evenly spaced metal-plated holes for building more permanent circuits.

#### Tools
- Wire strippers, wire, wire cutters, needle nose pliers, and other essential tools.

### Project Walk-Throughs
- **Hacked Toaster**
  - Modified the toasting element and added a mask for custom toasting patterns.
- **Electric Beer Mug**
  - Used a Pentium III cooling system to create a self-chilling mug, powered by a 12V cigarette lighter outlet or PC power supply.
- **LED Flashlight Conversion**
  - Converted a standard flashlight to an LED flashlight, focusing on the bulb replacement.

### Large Scale Hack Description
- **Blinkenlights**
  - An 8-story building turned into a giant display using individually controlled halogen lamps in each window.
  - Controlled by a Linux PC with a 192-channel parallel I/O card.
  - Over 5,000 meters of Cat5 cable used.
  - Photos courtesy of the Chaos Computer Club in Germany.

### A Renaissance in Hacking!
- Hardware hacking is easy, fun, and educational.
- It promotes recycling and reusing old equipment.
- Always be cautious when working with devices plugged into the wall or containing powerful motors.
- Go home today and start hacking something!
