### 7.8 Attack Resilience

In this section, we introduce a new attack method, which is an enhanced version of the coincidental-pattern attack described in Polygraph. We term this the "token-fit attack." This attack involves a hacker obtaining normal traffic with a similar token distribution as the normal noise in the suspicious pool. The hacker can then extract tokens from this normal traffic and intentionally encode them into a worm. By including different sets of tokens in different worm samples, the hacker does not increase the similarity between worm samples in terms of shared tokens but can increase the similarity of worm samples to the normal traffic noise in the suspicious pool. This degrades the quality of the generated signature.

To evaluate the resilience of Hamsa and Polygraph against this attack, we modified the ATPhttpd exploit to inject 40 different tokens into the variant part of each worm sample. These tokens were extracted from the normal traffic noise in the same suspicious pool. We tested both systems using a suspicious pool of 50 samples with a noise ratio of 550%. Over two trials, we found that Hamsa consistently produced correct signatures, as shown in Table 2. However, Polygraph failed to detect any of the polymorphic worms (100% false negative), although it did not produce any false positives.

### 8. Related Work

Early efforts in automated worm signature generation include Honeycomb [12], Autograph [10], and EarlyBird [24]. These systems use different methods to classify worm flows and normal traffic, but all assume that a worm will have a long invariant substring. This assumption does not hold for polymorphic worms, which do not share a sufficiently long common substring.

Recent research on polymorphic worm signature generation and related studies [4, 13, 14, 16, 26, 31] has led to several approaches. In Table 6, we compare Hamsa with these techniques based on the following metrics:
1. **Network vs. Host Based**: Network-based systems use only network traffic and can be deployed on routers/gateways.
2. **Content vs. Behavior Based**: Content-based detection relies on the content of the traffic, while behavior-based detection focuses on the behavior of the traffic.
3. **Noise Tolerance**: The ability to handle noisy data.
4. **On-line Detection Speed**: The speed at which the generated signature can be compared with network traffic.
5. **General Purpose vs. Application Specific**: Some schemes require detailed protocol/application specification knowledge.
6. **Provable Attack Resilience**: The system's ability to withstand specific attacks.
7. **Information Exploited**: The type of information used for detection.

**Polygraph [16]**: This system considers three methods of generating signatures: (1) set of tokens, (2) sequences of tokens, and (3) weighted set of tokens. As shown in Section 7, Hamsa significantly outperforms Polygraph in terms of speed and attack resilience.

**Position-Aware Distribution Signatures (PADS) [26]**: PADS combines signature-based and statistical anomaly-based approaches to detect variants of the MSBlaster worm. However, its accuracy suffers in the presence of noise.

**Nemean [31]**: This system uses protocol semantics to cluster worm traffic and reconstruct connection and session-level signatures. It requires detailed protocol specifications for each application and may fail to produce effective signatures in noisy environments.

**Control Flow Graph (CFG) Similarity [13]**: This approach generates fingerprints based on the structural similarity of CFGs. However, it can be evaded by using SED, and matching fingerprints is computationally expensive.

**TaintCheck [17] and DACODA [5]**: These systems dynamically trace and correlate network input to control flow changes to find malicious inputs. While useful for understanding worms and vulnerabilities, they cannot automatically generate signatures and are highly application-specific.

**COVERS [14]**: This system, based on address-space randomization, can detect and correlate network input to generate signatures. However, the signatures generated, though effective for server protection, cannot be used by NIDSes or firewalls due to potential evasion. COVERS is also application-specific.

**Malware Detection [4]**: This approach models malicious program behavior and detects code pieces similar to an abstract model. However, it is computationally expensive.

### 9. Conclusion

In this paper, we present Hamsa, a network-based signature generation system for zero-day polymorphic worms. Hamsa generates multisets of tokens as signatures and achieves significant improvements in speed, accuracy, and attack resilience over Polygraph. We prove that the multiset signature generation problem is NP-Hard in the presence of noise and design model-based signature generation algorithms with analytical attack resilience guarantees. The signatures generated by Hamsa can be easily deployed in IDSes such as Snort [22] or Bro [19].
