### Introduction

During the holiday season, the Apple iPhone remains one of the most popular models, as indicated by a 2017 chart from Newzoo. This popularity underscores the importance of understanding the security and privacy implications associated with these devices.

### Appendix

#### A. Nominal Gain Estimation

Figure 6 shows the estimated gyroscope nominal gain from two iPhone X devices. Both devices were at rest on a desk during data collection. To present the results more clearly, the figure only displays a small range of data. As shown in the figure, the difference between the estimated gyroscope nominal gain from these two devices is minimal. Therefore, the estimated nominal gain from one device can be used to estimate the gain matrix of another device. The figure also indicates that the degree of fluctuations around the nominal gain differs for these two devices, suggesting that their gain matrices are distinct and may serve as fingerprints.

#### B. Gain Matrix Estimations of an iPhone 5

The estimations of the gyroscope gain matrix of an iPhone 5 are shown in Figure 7. Here, the values in each column correspond to the nine gain matrix values estimated from one batch of data (five batches in total), subtracting the nominal gain (unit: 2^-16 dps).

#### C. Screenshots of the GYROID Proof of Concept App

Screenshots of the GYROID proof of concept app are shown in Figure 8.

#### D. Distribution of the GYROID

Results are presented in Figures 9, 10, and 11.

- (a) and (b) provide visual representations of the app's interface.

**Figure 9: Distribution of each element in the GYROID (nominal gain = 61 mdps)**
- This figure shows the distribution of each element in the GYROID.

**Figure 10: Q-Q plot of each element in the GYROID (nominal gain = 61 mdps)**
- If the distribution of a variable is normal, its Q-Q plot should appear linear.
