### E-Mail Address Usage

**Turnaround Time and Usage Period:**
- **Turnaround Spread (Hours):**
  - 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1,000
- **Usage Period (Days):**
  - 1, 10, 100, 1,000

**Distribution of Turnaround Times:**
- 80% of the pages show a spread of less than a day.
- 27% of the pages show a spread of 0 seconds.

**Usage Period:**
- 11% of addresses were used for less than a second.
- 17% of addresses were used for less than a day.
- 78% of addresses were used for less than a week.
- The longest observed usage was 1,068 days.

**Comparison with Search Engines:**
- Addresses advertised to search engines have slower turnaround times.
- 50% of addresses spammed within 11 days after a visit by a search engine bot.

### Geolocation of Harvesting IPs

**Top 10 Harvesting Countries:**
- 60.6% of all bot IPs are located in Germany.
- Majority of harvesting requests originate from AS3320 (Deutsche Telekom residential access lines).

**Spam Volume by Country:**
- Romanian and Bulgarian bots caused 72% of the received spam.
- German bots, making up 60% of distinct IPs, were responsible for only 10% of the spam.

### Fingerprinting: User Agent Strings

**User Agent String Usage:**
- 19% of classified hosts submitted user agent strings mimicking major search engines.
- 5% of hosts using the Google bot user agent do not originate from the Google AS.
- Java user agent (e.g., "Java/1.6.0 17") is still present and used by 3% of harvester hosts.
- These hosts account for 88% of page requests leading to spam and 55% of total spam.

**Case Study:**
- A personalized response was received 10 minutes after an inquiry, originating from a residential access line in the Netherlands.
- The IP matched the one that harvested the address a few days before, indicating the same entity conducted both harvesting and spamming.

### Address Presentation Method Robustness

**Webmaster Concerns:**
- How to display e-mail addresses on the web to prevent spam?
- Should they be presented in a user-friendly or obfuscated way?

This analysis provides insights into the behavior of bots, the geolocation of harvesting activities, and the usage patterns of harvested e-mail addresses. Further investigation is needed to understand the relationship between harvesting and spamming activities.
