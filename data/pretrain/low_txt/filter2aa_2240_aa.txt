### 1. Introduction

In recent years, web browsers have increasingly become a primary target for infection vectors on vulnerable hosts. Traditional vulnerability exploitation required attackers to scan for and remotely connect to vulnerable hosts (typically servers) to exploit them. In contrast, web browser vulnerabilities are commonly exploited when a user visits a malicious website.

Attacks on web browsers rely on malicious content being rendered by built-in interpreters (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, CSS) or vulnerable plug-in technologies (e.g., Flash, QuickTime, Java). These vulnerabilities expose the system to various exploit techniques and malicious code. Trend reports indicate that the number of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities has been increasing since 2000, reaching 89.4% of reported vulnerabilities in 2007. A growing percentage of these vulnerabilities are associated with web browsers.

Profit-driven cybercriminals have adopted web browser exploitation as a key vector for malware installation. To achieve widespread infection, criminals must either seed popular and high-traffic websites or use email spam to direct potential victims to web servers hosting malicious content. This method is known as a drive-by download, where the web browser navigates to a malicious page and covertly downloads and executes malware, typically trojans.

As this attack vector has gained popularity, there have been frequent reports of hundreds of thousands of websites being defaced, often through embedded iframes. These iframes include content from servers hosting malicious JavaScript code designed to exploit browser vulnerabilities and initiate drive-by malware downloads. Even reputable sites like un.org and .gov.uk have fallen victim to such attacks. In 2007, Google uncovered more than three million malicious URLs initiating drive-by downloads.

While several studies have focused on the scale of mass-defacements and malicious content, none have provided a quantitative analysis of the number of users at risk due to insecure web browser technologies. This paper quantifies the visible portion of the "Insecurity Iceberg" using passive evaluation techniques, estimating over 600 million users at risk in June 2008.

### 2. Data Sources and Methodology

The analysis and conclusions of this study depend on the breadth and scope of the data. While statistics on web browser market shares are available, the data sources used here are unique in scope, detail, and quality.

The data used to measure the global population of vulnerable web browsers was provided by Google and is a subset of non-personally identifiable data accumulated from Google's search and web application server logs from January 2007 to June 2008. With Google's search queries coming from more than 75% of internet users, our measurements are globally representative.

Our analysis aimed to establish the global scale of web browser-based insecurity. Unlike related "browser market share" studies, we used both major and minor version information and correlated it with known security patch release dates. Key points in our methodology include:

- **HTTP USER-AGENT Header**: We used the HTTP USER-AGENT header field, which contains information about the browser type, version, and operating system, to calculate the usage share of each browser version.
- **Unique Browser Installations**: We measured the number of unique web browser installations active on a given day, rather than the number of page hits or visits.
- **Patch-Level Analysis**: For Firefox, Safari, and Opera, we used minor version information to determine the specific patch level. For Internet Explorer, we relied on Secunia’s Personal Software Inspector (PSI) statistics.
- **Daily Uniqueness**: Each web browser was counted only once per host per day using Google's default cookie system to ensure uniqueness.
- **Data Points**: Week-day statistics were used for graphing and comparison purposes.
- **Correlation with Update Mechanisms**: We measured the dynamics of software version updates and compared results with available update mechanisms.

At no time during this study did the authors have access to personally identifiable information. Google takes user privacy seriously and automatically expires cookies after a limited period.

### 3. The Insecurity Iceberg of Internet Users at Risk

#### 3.1 Measurement of Browser Versions in Daily Use

Most commercial vendors of web browser technologies have made significant progress in making their products more resilient to common security threats. Their development life-cycles now include multiple levels of secure design and vulnerability testing, as well as new processes for handling externally discovered flaws. Most updates and patches for web browsers and third-party plug-ins incorporate new and vital security fixes.

For years, the software industry has promoted the best practice of always using the most recent version of installed software and promptly applying the latest patches. Failure to do so can lead to host infection and data loss.

Using the Google data set and a catalog of known vulnerabilities and security patches, we estimated the lower bound of the number of web browsers failing to apply patches. In mid-June 2008, the most commonly used browsers were Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) at 78%, Mozilla's Firefox (FF) at 16%, Apple's Safari (SF) at 3%, and Opera (OP) at 1%.

| Browser Type | IE | FF | SF | OP | Total |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|-------|
| Share of browsers in daily use in percent | 78.3% | 16.1% | 3.4% | 0.8% | 98.6% |
| Browsers in daily use in million (on the Internet worldwide) | 1103 | 227 | 48 | 11 | 1389 |

Table 1: Percentage of web browsers by type according to TheCounter.com, averaged from February 1st to June 18th, 2008. Absolute counts derived from the global internet user count of 1,408 billion users.

#### 3.2 Most Secure Browser

In this section, the most secure browser refers to the latest official public release of a vendor's web browser. Beta versions are not considered official releases.

We used the most recent major versions of Internet Explorer 7 (IE7), Firefox 2 (FF2), Safari 3 (SF3), and Opera 9 (OP9) as the benchmark for our most secure web browser measurements. Microsoft's Internet Explorer version 6, regardless of its patch level, is not considered the most secure version by experts.

| Latest Major Version | IE7 | FF2 | SF3 | OP9 | Total |
|----------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Release date of latest major version | 2006-10-18 | 2006-10-24 | 2007-10-26 | 2006-06-20 | - |
| Share of latest major version within browser type | 52.5% | 92.2% | 70.2% | 90.1% | 59.1% |
| Number of latest major version in million (worldwide) | 579 | 209 | 34 | 10 | 832 |

Table 2: Share of the latest major version within a given type of browser, as seen on Google’s search and application websites in the first week of June 2008. Absolute counts calculated using Table 1.

Analysis of the distribution of patches within the latest major version was used to measure the share of the most secure version for each browser type. For Firefox, Safari, and Opera, we used HTTP USER-AGENT information. For Internet Explorer, we relied on Secunia’s PSI statistics.

As shown in Figure 3, we found that at most 83.3% of Firefox users, 65.3% of Safari users, 56.1% of Opera users, and 47.6% of Internet Explorer users were using the latest most secure browser version between January 2007 and June 2008. For Safari, we considered the date range from December 2007 to June 2008, when Safari version 3 became widespread.

Despite Firefox's single-click integrated auto-update functionality, 16.7% of Firefox users continue to use outdated versions. Meanwhile, 43.9% of Opera users and 52.4% of Internet Explorer users rely on superseded versions.

While Table 2 represents a snapshot from early June 2008, Figure 2 shows how these usage shares have changed over time as users migrate to the latest major version of their preferred web browser.

It is noteworthy that it took 19 months from the initial general availability of IE7 (public release October 2006) to reach 52.5% proliferation. In contrast, 92.2% of Firefox users have migrated to FF2. The migration process is generally slow.
