#### Extended Abstract

Workflow management systems (WfMSs) have been supporting various types of business processes for over a decade. In e-commerce, suppliers and customers establish binding agreements or contracts that specify quality of service (QoS) parameters such as the products or services to be delivered, deadlines, product quality, and service costs. Effective QoS management is crucial for the success of organizations participating in e-commerce. Modern market conditions demand high standards of QoS, with well-defined specifications for products and services. Good QoS management leads to the creation of high-quality products and services, which in turn meet customer expectations and achieve customer satisfaction.

When services or products are created or managed using workflow processes, the underlying WfMS must be capable of accepting, predicting, monitoring, and controlling the QoS provided to customers. To achieve these objectives, the first step is to develop an appropriate QoS model for workflow processes.

QoS models have been developed for various domains, including networking, multimedia, and middleware. Our previous work on deploying workflow applications highlighted the need for QoS management in workflow processes. We also recognized that workflow processes have specific, domain-dependent requirements that must be considered when creating a QoS model. Other researchers have also identified the need for a QoS process model. A notable example is the DAML-S specification, which provides an ontology for semantically describing business processes (as compositions of Web services). This ontology facilitates process interoperability between trading partners in e-commerce activities and includes constructs for specifying QoS parameters such as quality guarantees, quality ratings, and degrees of quality.

While DAML-S has identified QoS as a key component for Web services and business processes, its current QoS model has limitations. One significant limitation is that every process requires QoS metrics to be specified by the user, and it does not provide a solution for automatically computing QoS metrics for processes based on the QoS metrics of their sub-processes.

To better understand the impact and scope of this problem, consider that workflows and processes often consist of tens to hundreds of sub-processes (also known as composite processes or network tasks). These processes can be represented using a tree structure, where the root node represents the main process, intermediate nodes represent sub-processes, and leaves represent atomic processes (or atomic tasks). We propose that QoS metrics should be specified for the leaves (atomic processes) whenever possible. Using an appropriate algorithm, the QoS values of the leaves can then be used to compute the QoS values for the intermediate nodes (sub-processes) up to the root node. While setting QoS for an atomic process can be complex, it is even more challenging to compute the QoS for a process composed of hundreds of sub-processes. Our work aims to address this challenge by automatically computing the QoS for processes based on the QoS attributes of atomic tasks.

A critical requirement for this methodology is that the quality dimensions in the QoS model must be computable, meaning there must be a function at each node of the process tree that can be applied to its children. Based on this observation, we developed a QoS model where all dimensions are computable. We investigated relevant work to determine the most relevant dimensions for our wQoS model and, based on previous studies and our experience in the workflow domain, constructed a model consisting of the following dimensions: time, cost, fidelity, and reliability.

We hope that this work will contribute to the development of Web service specification standards, as well as to the realization of E-services and processes through the composition of Web services.
