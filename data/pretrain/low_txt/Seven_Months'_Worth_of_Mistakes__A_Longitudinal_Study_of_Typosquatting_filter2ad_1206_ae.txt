### Typosquatting and Related Domain Abuse Techniques

Typosquatters exploit mistyped domain names to display advertisements, thereby generating revenue. Consequently, these networks can be held equally responsible for the damage inflicted on the legitimate domains that are being targeted. In addition to using ads as a monetization strategy, there have been documented cases where typosquatting domains have been used to distribute malware [9]. Nikiforakis et al. [20] demonstrated that typosquatting can also occur outside the browser's address bar, through remote JavaScript inclusions. Developers may mistype the domains of remote code providers, making their sites vulnerable to malicious script injections via the mistyped domains.

Szurdi et al. [23] recently investigated typosquatting registrations targeting .com domains in the "long tail" of the popularity distribution. They introduced a tool called Yet Another Typosquatting Tool (YATT), which uses passive and active domain features, such as DNS, WHOIS, and content information, to identify and categorize typosquatting domains. The authors used YATT to classify 4.7 million potential typosquatting .com domains derived from the Alexa top 1 million. Their findings indicate that, although the prevalence of typosquatting decreases for less popular authoritative domains, it remains at 40% near the Alexa 1 million rank, with an estimated 20% of all .com domains being typosquatting domains. The study also includes a longitudinal component, tracking domain registrations between October 2012 and October 2013 based on daily dumps of the .com zone file. Unlike our study, the content of these domains is not considered in the longitudinal analysis. When a new domain appears in the zone file, it is compared against the list of all potential typosquatting domains generated from the Alexa 1 million to determine if it is an active typosquatting domain. The authors found that typosquatting domains associated with popular authoritative domains change hands more frequently than other domains.

Vissers et al. [24] recently conducted a study on the ecosystem of domain parking services. While these services have been previously examined in the context of cybersquatting, this study focused specifically on the domain parking ecosystem. The authors discovered that between 1.63% and 9% of the investigated parking domains are typosquatting domains. Additionally, some parking service providers have a significantly higher ratio of typosquatting domains, with only one provider serving no typosquatting domains at all.

### Homograph Attacks

In domain-homograph attacks, attackers exploit the visual similarity between characters to trick users into believing they are interacting with a specific legitimate website when, in fact, they are interacting with a malicious one. This confusion can be used to convince users to submit their credentials and other sensitive information. Unlike typosquatting, homograph domains are often spread through spam emails and social networks rather than relying on user typing mistakes.

Gabrilovich and Gontmakher [10] showed that characters from non-Latin character sets that resemble Latin characters can be substituted to confuse users. For example, an attacker could register paypal.com using the Cyrillic letter "р" (Unicode U+0440), which looks almost identical to the Latin letter "p". Today, this type of attack is more challenging due to browser vendors reverting to the punycode format of URLs [4] when they detect potentially malicious domains.

Dhamija et al. [6] explored why phishing works and mentioned "visually deceptive text," such as bankofvvest.com (with two "v"s instead of a "w"). Holgers et al. [13] conducted a large-scale study of homograph attacks by gathering popular domains and searching for their homographed versions. Their results showed that, while the monetization strategies of homograph domains are similar to traditional domain squatting, the practice of registering homograph domains is significantly less common than typosquatting.

### Other Types of Domain Squatting

In 2011, Dinaburg proposed bitsquatting [7], a new form of domain squatting. He hypothesized that random bit-flips in failing hardware memory or memory operating outside normal temperatures could be exploited for domain squatting. Domain squatters can register domains with a one-bit difference from popular authoritative domains and capture traffic resulting from such erroneous bit-flips. Dinaburg registered 30 bitsquatting domains, such as mic2osoft.com, and recorded over 50,000 requests over an eight-month period. Later research confirmed that domain squatters have adopted this technique [18]. Recently, Nikiforakis et al. [19] discovered that domain squatters are also exploiting the sound similarity of words to create malicious squatting domains and attract users.

### Conclusion

Typosquatting has been known and studied for over 15 years, yet it remains a prevalent form of domain abuse. Our first content-based longitudinal study of typosquatting abuse has revealed several key findings:
1. Few trademark owners protect themselves by defensively registering typosquatting domains.
2. Over 75% of all possible typosquatting domains for short, popular authoritative domains are already registered, and typosquatters are increasingly targeting longer domains.
3. Typosquatters vary their monetization strategies over time.
4. Some companies choose not to renew their defensive registrations, allowing these domains to be re-registered by typosquatters.
5. Up to 50% of all typosquatting domains can be traced back to just four typosquatting page hosters.
6. Certain top-level domains are less prone to typosquatting due to their pricing and local registration and arbitration policies.

We hope this paper and the accompanying dataset, which is publicly available online, will serve as a new reference for the current state of typosquatting.
