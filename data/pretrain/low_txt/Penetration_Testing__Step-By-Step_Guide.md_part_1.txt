## Preface
Penetration testing is the practice of probing networks, systems, and applications to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. This process involves skilled ethical hackers who simulate real-world attacks to uncover weaknesses and provide detailed reports to the organization's information security team. Regular penetration testing is often required to maintain compliance with industry standards such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

This book is designed for individuals with no prior knowledge of penetration testing or ethical hacking. It serves as a practical, step-by-step guide to the techniques and tools used by ethical hackers. The guide is based on Kali Linux, a popular operating system for penetration testing, and assumes no prior knowledge of the platform. It covers all phases of penetration testing, from reconnaissance and scanning to gaining and maintaining access, and includes 73 hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.

### Who is This Book For?
This book is ideal for anyone interested in information security, ethical hacking, and penetration testing. It is particularly useful for beginners with little to no experience in the field, as well as for IT and information security managers who want to understand the threats to their systems and the measures needed to protect them. The book provides clear, easy-to-follow instructions and screenshots to help readers set up a testing environment and perform each penetration test.

### Ethical Considerations
This book teaches you to be a white-hat ethical hacker. The exercises listed can be harmful and illegal if performed in a real environment without proper authorization. Always obtain permission before conducting any penetration tests. Do not use the skills learned for illegal activities, and keep all data gathered during penetration testing confidential.

## Chapter 1: Lab Setup
This chapter will guide you through setting up the necessary environment to perform the exercises in the following chapters. You will need a laptop with at least 8GB of RAM and 64GB of disk space (Windows or Mac). The chapter will cover the installation of Oracle VirtualBox, Kali Linux, Windows 10, and Metasploitable, as well as the configuration of a USB Wi-Fi adapter.

### 1. Lab Setup Preparations
To complete the labs in this training course, you will need the following:
- **Host Machine**: Windows or Mac with at least 8GB of RAM (16GB recommended) and 80GB of disk space (250GB recommended).
- **Virtual Machines**: Three virtual machines will be installed.
- **External USB Wi-Fi Adapter**: Compatible with both the host machine and Kali Linux.

- **Download**: Register and download Metasploitable from [Rapid7](https://information.rapid7.com/metasploitable-download.html).
- **Install in VirtualBox**:
  - Open VirtualBox and click "New."
  - Name: Metasploitable, Type: Linux, Version: Ubuntu 64-bit.
  - Allocate 512MB to 1GB of RAM.
  - Choose "Use an existing virtual hard disk file" and select the .vmdk file.

#### 1.5. Installing Victim-2 Machine (Windows 10)
- **Download**: Microsoft provides several Windows 10 virtual machines available for download [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms).
- **Install**:
  - Download the Win10.ova file.
  - Right-click the file and choose "Open with VirtualBox."
  - Agree to the import settings.

#### 1.6. Installing VBox Extension Pack and Guest Additions
- **Extension Pack**: Enables file sharing, screen resizing, and other features.
  - Download and install from [VirtualBox Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/downloads).
- **Guest Additions**:
  - For Kali Linux, open the terminal and run the following commands:
    ```bash
    sudo apt purge virtualbox-guest-x11
    sudo apt autoremove --purge
    sudo reboot
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt dist-upgrade
    sudo reboot
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y virtualbox-guest-x11
    sudo reboot
    ```

#### 1.7. Configuring NAT in VirtualBox
- **NAT Network**: Allows communication between virtual machines.
- **Create NAT Network**:
  - Go to `File/Preferences/Network/Add New NAT Network`.
  - Configure the network settings for each VM under `Settings/Network`.

#### 1.8. Updating Kali Linux
- **Login**:
  - User: `kali`
  - Password: `kali`
- **Update**:
  - Open the terminal and run:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install terminator
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    ```
- **Root Login**:
  - To avoid using `sudo` for every command, set a root password and log in as root:
    ```bash
    sudo passwd root
    su
    ```
