**ATT&CK ID:** T1499.004  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Application or System Exploitation

Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities to cause an application or system to crash, thereby denying availability to users. While some systems are configured to automatically restart critical applications and services in the event of a crash, these systems can often be re-exploited, leading to a persistent denial of service (DoS) condition.
