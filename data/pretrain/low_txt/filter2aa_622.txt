## Introduction
- **A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words: Deep Neural Networks for Social Steganography**
- **The Evolution of Steganography**

## Covert Communication
- **Definition**: Any communication channel that can be exploited to transfer information in a manner that violates the system's security policy.
- **Source**: U.S. Department of Defense, Trusted Computer System Evaluation (DoD 5200.28-STD, 1985)

## Evolution of Steganography
- **Early Tools**: Simple, designed to exploit sensory weaknesses.
- **JPEG Embedding**: Many copycats with new features, greater focus on JPEG embedding.
- **Resilience**: Methods become more resilient to statistical attacks.
- **Multimedia**: Evolves into a viable method.
- **Steganographic File Systems**: Begin to emerge.
- **VOIP, RTP, and UDP Techniques**: Emerge along with decoys to complicate detection and recovery.

### Internet Era
- **Stego Apps Decoy Techniques (OpenPuff)**
- **Stealth Alternate Data Streams (NT)**
- **Weaponized CnC - Operation Shady RAT (McAfee)**
- **Protocols - VOIP, RTP, UDP => WiFi StegoStuffing, Bluetooth (Hosmer/Raggo - Wall of Sheep/Skytalks DC23 & 24)**
- **MP3 ID3 Metadata Exploitation (Hosmer/Raggo Skytalks DC24)**
- **SmartWatch SWATtackhide.py Tizen SDK (Mike Raggo - DEF CON 24 Demo Labs and Wall of Sheep)**

## Types of Steganography
- **Text/Linguistic Stego**: Using natural language.
- **Image Stego**: 
  - Spatial (e.g., LSB)
  - Frequency (DCT/DWT)
  - Metadata (varies by file type and versions - JPEG EXIF vs. JFIF)
- **Audio and Video Stego**
- **Protocols**
- **Use of Crypto with Stego**: Vigenere, base64, XOR, etc.

## DIY Social Steganography
- **Social Network Image Proliferation**:
  - 100+ hours of video uploaded per minute.
  - 4.75 billion pieces of content shared per day.
  - 500+ million tweets per day.
  - 80+ million images uploaded per day.
  - 5 billion +1’s per day.
- **Engagement**: Images produce 650% higher engagement than text alone.

### Social Stego in the Wild
- **White Hat**: Instegogram
- **Black Hat**: HAMMERTOSS

### Social Network Photo Targets
- **Profile Image**
- **Background Image**
- **Posted Images**
- **Photo Albums**
- **DM Images**

### Carrier Image File Types
- **Lossy v. Lossless Raster Compression**
- **DPI/PPI**
- **Common File Formats**:
  - JPEG (Lossy)
  - PNG (Lossless)
  - TIFF (Lossless)
  - GIF (Lossy)
  - BMP (Lossy)

### Trial and Error - Attempted Methods
- **Metadata Fields** (varies by image types - JPEG EXIF vs. JFIF, etc.)
- **LSB - Least Significant Bit**
- **Insertion**
- **Append after EOF Marker**
- **Pre and Post Upload**
- **Linguistic Steganography**

### High-Level Testing Workflow
- **Social Network Data Hiding Survivability**

## Deep Neural Networks for Social Steganography
- **Secretbook by Owen Campbell-Moore**:
  - Open-source Social Stego tool
  - Chrome Extension (2013)
  - Reverse-engineered Facebook’s lossy compression algorithm
  - Allowed for payloads of up to 140 characters in length

### Jamming Techniques
- **Server-side Image Upload Restrictions and Alterations**
- **Legal Concerns**:
  - Crime investigations
  - Trademark infringement
- **Common Image Upload Alterations**:
  - Recompression
  - Metadata stripping
  - Filetype conversion
  - Resizing

### Bulk Image Uploads/Downloads
- **Data Acquisition Made Easy**:
  - Permissive APIs for content creation
  - More content = more engagement = profit
- **Off-the-shelf Photo Aggregators**:
  - Facebook albums
  - Pinterest boards
  - Flickr sets
  - Google+ Collections

### Auto-Generating Data
- **Select 50k ImageNet Samples**
- **Automate Uploads and Downloads**
- **Compare Pixels Between Phases**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:
  - Proven great for computer vision tasks (object classification, facial recognition)
  - Pose as a regression task to locate optimally embeddable pixels
  - Model spec: Keras on top of TensorFlow (Python), Google GPU (8 vCPU Nvidia Tesla)

### Prototype Evaluation
- **More Robust, Less Detectable Transmission**
- **Learned Locations Correspond to Complex and “Busier” Areas**
- **Minimal Visual Dissimilarity**:
  - Distortion: peak signal-to-noise ratio
  - Capacity: byte survivability
- **Recovery Rates Worsen as Hidden Data Size Decreases**

## Data-Driven Red and Blue Teaming
- **InfoSec ML Historically Prioritizes Defense**
- **Data-Driven Social Engineering**:
  - SNAP_R: Fully Automated, 30-35% Accuracy
  - Spear Phishing: Highly Manual, 45% Accuracy
  - Phishing: Mostly Automated, 5-14% Accuracy

### Red Team ML Rising
- **Growing Number of Examples**:
  - Micro-targeted social engineering
  - Password cracking
  - Captcha subversion
  - AV evasion
  - Steganography
- **Offensive ML Easier Than Defensive ML**:
  - Labeling bottleneck - unsupervised
  - Success matters more for blue than red team
  - Retreating barriers to entry (open-source initiatives, cheap access to powerful machines)

### Mitigations
- **More Sophisticated and Dynamic Jamming Techniques**
- **Anomaly/Histogram Analysis - Increased Quantization**
- **Impermanence: Delete by Default**
- **Ephemeral Images (Snapchat)**
- **Steganalysis is Hard!**
- **Variance in Social Networks Adds Exponential Complexity to Identifying Existence of Stego and Recovery of Evidence**

## Summary and Questions
- **Social Networks and Image Hosting Services Can Be Used to Transmit Data Covertly**
- **Steganography Can Be Automated Despite Distorting Image Upload Side Effects**
- **Offensive AI is Cheaper and Easier to Implement Than Defensive AI**
- **Code Released Soon, PRs Welcome**
