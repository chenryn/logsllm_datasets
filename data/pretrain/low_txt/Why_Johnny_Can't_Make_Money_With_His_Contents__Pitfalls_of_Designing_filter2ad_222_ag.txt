#### Security Considerations
- **CWEs (Common Weakness Enumerations):**
  - **CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk**
    - The application stores sensitive information in cleartext in a file or on disk.
  - **CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**
    - The software transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.
  - **CWE-354: Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value**
    - The software does not validate or incorrectly validates the integrity check values or "checksums" of a message. This may prevent it from detecting if the data has been modified or corrupted in transmission.
  - **CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**
    - The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.
  - **CWE-454: External Initialization of Trusted Variables or Data Stores**
    - The software initializes critical internal variables or data stores using inputs that can be modified by untrusted actors.
  - **CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files**
    - Information written to log files can be of a sensitive nature and give valuable guidance to an attacker or expose sensitive user information.
  - **CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication**
    - A client/server product performs authentication within client code but not in server code, allowing server-side authentication to be bypassed via a modified client that omits the authentication check.
  - **CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data**
    - The software stores security-critical state information about its users, or the software itself, in a location that is accessible to unauthorized actors.
  - **CWE-654: Reliance on a Single Factor in a Security Decision**
    - A protection mechanism relies exclusively, or to a large extent, on the evaluation of a single condition or the integrity of a single object or entity in order to make a decision about granting access to restricted resources or functionality.
  - **CWE-656: Reliance on Security Through Obscurity**
    - The software uses a protection mechanism whose strength depends heavily on its obscurity, such that knowledge of its algorithms or key data is sufficient to defeat the mechanism.
  - **CWE-921: Storage of Sensitive Data in a Mechanism without Access Control**
    - The software stores sensitive information in a file system or device that does not have built-in access control.
