We should enhance the `preprocessing.Scaler` and `preprocessing.scale` utilities to support feature-wise scaling of sparse matrices to unit scale, without attempting to center the data first. This enhancement should be implemented in a manner consistent with the `RowNormalizer` refactoring, leveraging the same low-level Cython functions for consistency and efficiency.
