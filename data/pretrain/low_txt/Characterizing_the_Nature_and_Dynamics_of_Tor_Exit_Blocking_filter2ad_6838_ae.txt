### Proactive Blacklisting and Abuse Reduction for Tor

Over time, as the reputation of the Tor network improves, there may be a reduction in the need for proactive blacklisting. Our findings suggest that implementing privacy-sensitive abuse-reduction approaches for Tor could be beneficial.

From our analysis of email complaints, we identified the types of unwanted traffic that server operators find concerning enough to warrant sending a complaint. Among the types of abuse identified (detailed in §4), the majority—DMCA complaints—appear to be irrelevant for blocking purposes, as DMCA violators largely use peer-to-peer services. Furthermore, in our sample, these complaints are no longer common (see Table 2). Of the remaining complaints, nearly 90% related to large-scale abuse, such as excessive connection attempts, scanning, brute-force login attempts, and spam. While the rate of complaints might not be proportional to the rate of unwanted traffic, it provides insights into the most troubling forms of abuse exiting the Tor network. Our data also show that exit policies have no significant impact on reducing abuse complaints or the rate of discrimination against Tor users.

Given the substantial footprint of the observed abuse, future research should focus on developing tools to curb such abuse while preserving user privacy and the functionality of Tor. We envision Tor nodes using cryptographic protocols, such as secure multi-party computation and zero-knowledge proofs, to detect and deter users who generate large amounts of traffic in patterns indicative of abuse. For example, Tor could compute privacy-sensitive global counts of visits to each threatened domain and throttle exiting traffic to those that appear over-visited.

### Implications for Online Services

Combining our study results, we can contextualize the challenges facing both Tor users and online service operators: at most 182 email complaints per 100,000 Tor users, and over 20% of the top-500 websites blocking Tor users. Given that Tor users make purchases at the same rate as non-Tor users [6], this response may be excessive, and operators might consider less restrictive means of mitigating abuse. 

Operators can assist Tor in developing approaches to curb abuse or unilaterally adopt local solutions. For example, instead of outright blocking, servers could rate-limit users exiting from Tor for certain webpages (e.g., login pages). CloudFlare is currently developing a cryptographic scheme using blindly signed tokens to rate-limit Tor users' access to websites it hosts [39].

### Long-Term Solutions

We do not view IP-based blacklisting as a suitable long-term solution for the abuse problem. In addition to Tor aggregating users' reputations, IPv4 address exhaustion has led to significant IP address sharing. IPv6 may introduce the opposite problem: the abundance of addresses may make it too easy for a single user to rapidly change addresses. Therefore, in the long run, online service operators should shift to more advanced methods of curbing abuse, ideally ones that are compatible with Tor.

### Appendix

**A. Picking Threshold Values for Proactive Blacklisting**

We classify a blacklist as proactive if it enlists a large fraction of Tor exit relays within the first 24 hours of them appearing in the consensus. To determine the threshold for the fraction of Tor exit relays that, if blocked within 24 hours, we should consider the blacklist, we analyzed the value of the fraction for all blacklists. We found two blacklists: Snort IP and Paid Aggregator, which block 37% and 31% of all Tor exits within 24 hours, respectively. All other blacklists listed fewer than 5% of Tor IP addresses within 24 hours. This significant difference in behavior encouraged us to set the threshold at 30%.

**B. Classifying Exit Policies**

In this section, we describe our method for classifying the exit policies of all exit relays observed in 2015 and 2016. Since each relay could potentially have an arbitrary set of open ports (from the 65,535 possible ports), comparing the openness of exit policies is challenging. To simplify, we parsed the exit policy of each relay to extract the set of open ports and then computed the Jaccard similarity between the relay's open ports and each of the well-known exit policies that Tor supports (Default, Reduced, Reduced-Reduced, Lightweight, and Web). We classified a relay into one of the five categories based on the Jaccard similarity value. To ensure sufficient similarity, we classified the relay to the category of highest similarity, provided that the similarity value was at least 0.7. Only relays with a high enough similarity value with any of the well-known exit policies were considered for further analysis.

**C. IP Blacklisting and Relay Characteristics**

We trained a linear regression model to find the impact of relay characteristics, such as uptime, policy, and consensus weight, on the time a relay spends on reactive blacklists. The observed variable was the ratio of hours spent on the blacklist to the uptime of the relay. We trained the model on 20,500 exit relays' data (with feature scaling) and found that the coefficients learned for all the factors were extremely small (consensus weight = -0.00007, uptime = 0.009, policy = -0.00001). This indicates that these factors have very little impact on blacklisting of relays. It also suggests that changing to more conservative exit policies does not reduce the chances of relays getting blacklisted.
