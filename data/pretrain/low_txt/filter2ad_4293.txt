## Workshop Description

The workshop on Dependability and Robotics will cover the following key topics:

- Reliable sensing and control
- Fault-tolerant real-time processing
- Operability diagnosis
- Validation
- Fault location and isolation
- Decisional autonomy and exception handling
- Robustness of user-robot communication
- Networked operation
- Legal and liability issues
- Standards and their role today

A variety of application cases where robots closely interact with humans will be considered as study cases to highlight technical issues and societal impact. These include:
- Surgery
- Rehabilitation
- Personal assistance and personal robots
- Robotic guides and public-oriented services
- Hospital delivery

The workshop program will include invited technical presentations from both the robotics and dependability communities, as well as a panel discussion.

## Background

Robotic systems are complex machines controlled by software modules that implement basic functions such as real-time servo-loops and programs for supervision and action planning. These components are integrated within an architecture that defines the organization for robot operation.

### Dependability in Robotics

The issues of robustness and dependability in robotic systems have not received much attention in the general robotics community, except in very critical applications like assisted surgery. However, applications involving public-oriented service, assistive, and personal robots require close interactions with non-professional users, raising critical questions about physical safety and operational robustness. Both aspects can be addressed through the concept of dependability.

Other applications, such as space robotics and planetary exploration, also have similar concerns regarding dependability.

### Safety and Robustness

In industrial robotics, the workspace of machines and humans can be segmented. However, service and personal robots must, by definition, have physical contact and interaction with the user. The safety aspect is already a significant challenge in robotics research. A more difficult and far-reaching challenge is ensuring operational robustness, which is central to the concept of "intelligent" robots.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this workshop are to:

- Bring together researchers from the robotics and dependability communities to exchange views.
- Cross-fertilize their fields by reviewing the main technical challenges and research issues.
- Assess the research opportunities central to future critical developments.
- Foster research activity and international cooperation.
- Consider medium-term and long-term industrial applications.

## Topics Covered

The workshop will cover, but is not limited to, the following topics:

- Reliable sensing and control
- Fault-tolerant real-time processing
- Operability diagnosis
- Validation
- Fault location and isolation
- Decisional autonomy and exception handling
- Robustness of user-robot communication
- Networked operation
- Legal and liability issues
- Standards and their role today
