# Packing & the Friendly Skies
## By Deviant Ollam

### Introduction
You may have seen me before at various conferences and events, many of which I can’t drive to. In the past, my bags were frequently opened—sometimes not by the TSA. Now, I secure all my gear with heavy-duty padlocks, not TSA locks. This is allowed because I fly with firearms, which provides a higher level of security for my tech and other valuables.

### Why Fly with Firearms?
- **Easier than you think**
- **Relatively hassle-free**
- **Provides major security**

### Facts and the Law
- **Federal Standards**: Uniform across the U.S., but specifics can vary by airline. No one can abridge your rights.
- **Checked Bag Only, Unloaded**: This is a must.
- **Non-TSA Locks**: Only you have the key or combination.
- **Declared Upon Check-In**: Essential for compliance.

### Specifics About Packing
- **Hard Case**: Size can vary, but larger luggage can be used to leverage the law.
- **Ammunition Policies**: Vary by airline; check how it should be packed and the quantity allowed.
- **Bags May Not Be Opened Once Secured**: Unless you are present.
- **No Outside Indicator Labels**: Per 27 CFR 478.31 and 18 USC Section 922e.

### Procedure and What to Expect
- **Declare Your Firearm**: Do this properly at check-in.
- **Name Tags on Everything**: Inside and out.
- **Keep Cases Locked**: Better to be asked to open them multiple times than to send them unsecured.
- **Secondary Screening Area**: Be prepared for additional checks.
- **No Outside Labels**: U.S. federal law prohibits labels indicating the presence of a firearm.

### Extra Pointers
- **Be Clear When Declaring**: Avoid any ambiguity.
- **Stay Polite and Firm**: Know the rules and show them if needed (legal citation sheet available at deviating.net).
- **Peace of Mind Over Lost Luggage**: Prioritize security.

### International Travel Tips
- **Luggage Tagging**: Follow specific guidelines.
- **Clearing Customs**: Be aware of the process.
- **Interactions with Staff**: Stay polite and informed.

### Dealing with Hassles
- **Know the Rules**: Have legal citations ready.
- **Stay Polite, Stand Your Ground**: Be direct and confident.
- **Insurance Coverage**: Can vary, so check beforehand.
- **Weight Management**: Some flexibility is possible.
- **Inside Other Luggage**: Possible, but consider the benefits.

### What Counts as a Firearm?
- **Proper Guns, Flare Guns, Starter/Blank Pistols, Airsoft Pieces, Replica Weapons, Gun Parts, and Hardware**: The law defines "firearms" as those that expel a projectile by means of a combustible propellant. However, anything that looks like a firearm should be declared to avoid issues.

### Carrier Ratings
- **A, B, C, D (Maybe)**: Varies by carrier.

### Best Padlocks
- **Abus Granit 37/60**: $100
- **Abloy Protec 362**: $200+
- **Abloy Puck**: $90
- **Abus Diskus 20/70**: $35
- **Abloy PL321**: $25

### Personal Setup
- **81 mm Mortar Round Case**: $15
- **Heavy Hinged Hasp**: $10
- **Bolts with J-B Weld or Loctite**: $5
- **Ironclad Luggage**: $30
