### User Population and Personalization

Previous studies on user population and personalization have primarily relied on user surveys or active user participation, such as installing software on user machines [12, 11, 16, 14]. These studies found that 30% to 40% of users clear their cookies monthly. A separate study by Yahoo! [13] reported that 40% to 60% of users have empty browser caches, suggesting they also clear their cookies. Our findings align with these previous results, but our approach does not require user cooperation or special content setup.

### Host Mobility Studies

Host mobility studies have been conducted in the context of wireless [17, 27, 22, 25], ad hoc [24, 26], and cellular networks [19] to develop more accurate device movement models or to predict user locations. Simler et al. [35] analyzed user mobility based on login events to a university email server to generate synthetic traces. Recent work [33] proposed a technique for classifying IP addresses into home and travel categories to study host travel and relocation patterns in the U.S. By examining cross-domain cookies, our study focuses on normal host mobility patterns, enabling us to observe unusual phenomena and detect malicious activities.

### Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper, we conduct a large-scale exploration of common identifiers and quantify the amount of host-identifying information they reveal. Using month-long datasets from Hotmail and Bing, we demonstrate that common identifiers can track hosts with high precision and recall.

Our study also highlights the potential information leakage when service providers anonymize datasets (e.g., replacing IP addresses with IP prefixes) and release them to third-party collaborators or the public. For example, we show that hashes of browser information (i.e., anonymized UA strings) alone can be revealing when examined within a single network domain. Additionally, coarse-grained IP prefixes, when combined with hashed UA strings, achieve similar host-tracking accuracy to precise IP address information.

Our analysis suggests that users who wish to avoid being tracked should take more extensive measures than just clearing cookies. Uncommon behaviors, such as clearing cookies for each request, may instead distinguish a host from others. Users should consider modifying their user-agent strings (e.g., changing the default setting [10]), using proxies, and possibly employing sophisticated techniques like anonymous routing [37]. In some cases, combining several of these techniques, such as clearing cookies and using proxies or Tor, is necessary for effective protection.

Despite its privacy implications, our study demonstrates the security benefits of host tracking. Given the growing concerns over account hijacking and session hijacking, we anticipate that host fingerprinting and tracking techniques will help defend against such attacks in the future.

#### A. Tracking Stable Hosts

In the presence of NATs, proxies, and dynamic IP addresses, the mapping between a host and an IP address can be highly volatile. Service providers interested in fingerprinting stable hosts may trade coverage for accuracy. We show that the binding window length can serve as a confidence measure for this purpose.

Intuitively, stable and active hosts should have longer binding windows, making them easier to track than hosts that appear infrequently or change IP addresses often. Figure 10(a) shows the increase in precision and recall with longer binding windows using UA+IP as an example. However, as we impose stricter requirements on the binding window length, the percentage of fingerprints remaining decreases roughly proportionally, as shown in Figure 10(b). Half of the fingerprints have binding windows no longer than one week. Thus, we can explore a tradeoff between accuracy and coverage of tracking hosts using the binding window length as an adjustable parameter. Figure 10 suggests that using a binding window length of five days can achieve both high precision and recall without significant loss of coverage.

**Figure 10. Binding length and accuracy tradeoff.**

#### B. Non-returning Users

For the 101,427 "one-time" non-returning users observed only on the first day of the Search dataset, we are interested in whether this is because they stopped using the service or because they cannot be tracked. We expect users who leave the service to be less engaged than returning users. To test this hypothesis, we examine the average number of queries submitted by each CID and the percentage of CIDs that clicked on the query results. We compare these statistics between the set of returning users and the set of non-returning users, considering only churned new CIDs in this comparison.

Table 11 shows that returning users indeed appear to be more engaged, generating more queries on average and more likely to make clicks. Overall, 77.85% of the churned new CIDs belonging to returning users have clicks, while only 60.73% of the churned new CIDs from non-returning users have clicks.

**Table 11. The query and click behaviors of returning and non-returning users from the first day of the log.**

We further examine, for each CID, the percentage of search queries that resulted in clicks. For CIDs associated with returning users, Figure 11 shows a larger percentage of queries have clicks than CIDs associated with non-returning users. Half of the CIDs associated with returning users have clicks on 80% of their queries, while half of those associated with non-returning users have clicks on less than 50%.

**Figure 11. Cumulative distribution of the fraction of queries per CID that resulted in clicks.**

Another question of interest is whether users stop using the service because they are less active and have infrequent online activities. To quantify the degree of activity of the non-returning users, we measure the time interval and the number of login events between the last Bing search query and the last Hotmail login event that fall within the host's binding windows, shown in Figure 12. We find that though users in our data may have left the search service, many have continued online activities. More than 80% of these users are active even after 25 days (Figure 12(a)), and around 60% logged in more than 40 times (Figure 12(b)).
