### Infrastructure Monitoring and Log Management

Logz.io’s offerings are primarily based on open-source technologies. For storage, the company uses Prometheus-compatible M3DB for metrics and OpenSearch for logs and traces. OpenTelemetry is employed to collect trace data, which is then visualized using Jaeger. Initially, Logz.io focused on log monitoring built on Elasticsearch but has since expanded to cover broader monitoring and observability use cases.

In terms of critical capabilities, Logz.io scored below the mean across all categories, with its highest score in RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection). The quality of the open-source monitoring tools used by Logz.io is high, and the company has selected well-regarded projects with active communities to underpin its APM (Application Performance Monitoring) and observability solutions. However, Logz.io's scores were impacted by the large number of demonstration elements that were not attempted.

Logz.io’s APM and observability product is best suited for security operations use cases.

### ManageEngine

ManageEngine’s APM offering consists of two separate tools: ManageEngine Applications Manager (Version 15.4), an on-premises solution, and Site24x7, a SaaS-based deployment. As a subsidiary of Zoho Corp., ManageEngine shares some common code between these products, though they do not have feature parity. The ManageEngine portfolio also includes service desk, endpoint management, and identity management tools.

ManageEngine scored below the mean for all critical capabilities, with its highest scores in business analysis and IT service monitoring. Despite scoring lowest in RASP due to the lack of an integrated security offering, ManageEngine offers standalone security information and event management (SIEM) and security auditing tools within its broader portfolio.

Both ManageEngine products are best suited for small or midsize businesses (SMBs) and align well with the IT operations use case.

### Microsoft

Microsoft’s APM and observability product evaluated in this research is Microsoft Azure Monitor, part of the larger Azure cloud-based suite and available only as a SaaS solution. The APM and observability functionality in Azure Monitor includes Application Insights and Log Analytics.

Microsoft scored at or above the mean on all critical capabilities, with strong performance in business analysis and behavior analysis. Azure Monitor is tightly integrated with Microsoft’s development and operations tools, providing robust application debugging and distributed profiling capabilities. However, the product requires a high level of knowledge of both the product and the environment being analyzed, which can be a drawback.

Microsoft Azure Monitor integrates well with the vendor’s ecosystem, including Azure DevOps and GitHub, and extends bidirectional integration with many other popular DevOps tools. It lags in monitoring performance at endpoints and isolating performance issues caused by network traffic, which may require additional products.

Microsoft’s APM and observability offering is best suited for application owners/lines of business and DevOps/AppDev use cases.

TO includes more observability than APM features and is used by enterprises, startups, and service providers as a time-series-based monitoring platform. It supports OpenTelemetry distributed tracing for APM use cases.

VMware scored below the mean on all critical capabilities, with its strongest performance in application debugging and distributed profiling. Its lowest score was in business analysis due to the lack of native support for monitoring application user journeys. The absence of an integrated security option results in TO being marked “N/A” for RASP.

VMware is best suited for DevOps/AppDev and SRE/platform operations use cases.

### Context

With the increased adoption of hybrid and multicloud technologies to support digital transformation initiatives, APM and observability software solutions have become essential for a growing set of stakeholders in IT, software development, and business. These solutions help organizations improve user experience (UX), reduce mean time to repair (MTTR), enhance service availability, detect anomalous application behavior, and forecast future problems. They also provide critical data useful beyond IT operations, including insights into the impact of performance on customer behavior and business processes.

APM and observability software is part of an overall enterprise availability and performance monitoring portfolio, and its adoption becomes more important due to several factors:
- The growing trend and need for digital transformation, which emphasizes the health of applications and, by extension, the health of the business.
- Increasing application architecture and deployment complexity, including on-premises, hybrid, cloud-native, and multicloud deployments, along with the uptake of containers, Kubernetes, microservices, and serverless computing.
- The increasing velocity of application releases, configuration changes, and integrations.
- The large and varied number of potential endpoints from which enterprise business services are consumed.

### Product/Service Class Definition

APM and observability software solutions provide for the collection, aggregation, and analysis of data to assess application performance. These tools are increasingly tasked with solving complex issues in diverse and intricate application architectures—on-premises, in the cloud, and hybrid—using the APM critical capabilities identified in the Critical Capabilities Definition section of this research.

### Critical Capabilities Definition

**Business Analysis**
Business analysis identifies the health of the organization with respect to its key performance indicators (KPIs), including financial metrics. Business processes describe and track the flow and status of activities across the underlying infrastructure. This capability goes beyond performance and availability statistics, providing insight into lines of business (LOBs), including for digital marketers and application developers, on the efficacy of the services being offered. Metrics such as shopping cart abandonment rates, shopping cart conversions, and the financial value of transactions are key measures in this area.

**Root Cause Analysis**
Root cause analysis aims to determine the probable cause of a problem and construct a causality chain linking cause and effect. APM technology focuses on detecting and providing insight into root causes. The probable cause (e.g., a failure or degradation) is linked to the entities (e.g., applications, services, or infrastructure) that are affected or will be affected. This methodology helps differentiate between cause and effect and prioritizes repairs on the cause rather than addressing transient symptoms.

**IT Service/Infrastructure Monitoring**
This capability reflects whether agreed-upon commitments regarding responsiveness and uptime are being met. It includes identifying adherence to contracted service-level agreements (SLAs), operational-level agreements (OLAs), and service-level objectives (SLOs). These measures provide visibility to line-of-business and application owners, as well as to IT operations and DevOps teams, on the health of key services. The inclusion of infrastructure monitoring here reflects the sensitivity many organizations have regarding monitoring costs and agent sprawl. APM and observability solutions often presume compute instances or VM-level agents for collecting telemetry from applications, and collecting and analyzing infrastructure-level telemetry is increasingly expected.

**Application Debugging and Distributed Profiling (ADDP)**
ADDP is the process of identifying the sources of defects and errors in computer and program code and mitigating performance degradation. Application debugging is a primary activity of application developers and, sometimes, application support teams, in finding the causes of undesirable program effects. Distributed profiling focuses on identifying and localizing the sources of performance degradation across an infrastructure made up of applications, services, and machines.

**Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)**
RASP is a type of application shielding located on a workload or client endpoint that can identify vulnerable components at runtime and, in some cases, block attempts to exploit them. RASP features in APM and observability solutions offer an additional layer in a defense-in-depth strategy, rather than replacing other security solutions. This critical capability was introduced this year, so it is not unexpected that most vendors’ lowest scores were in this area.

**Behavior Analysis**
Behavior analysis facilitates the discovery and classification of user and application behavior by providing guided or ad hoc access to raw telemetry in a manner that supports iterative, hypothesis-driven, and exploratory analysis. This capability highlights the maturity of the observability component in APM and observability solutions.

### Use Cases

**IT Operations**
IT operations teams are typically responsible for keeping the infrastructure operating efficiently. Their areas of responsibility can vary widely, including specific silos such as the network team, server team, virtualization team, application support team, or cross-functional teams like a generalized monitoring team. Most use of APM and observability tools in traditional IT operations involves generalists tasked with quickly identifying problems through service monitoring and anomaly detection for early-warning notifications of performance issues.

**Security Operations**
Security operations are tasked with maximizing organizational resilience against business risks, threats, and exposure, and enabling prevention, detection, and response. Security operations are also responsible for the security operations center (SOC), which is the command, control, and response element for security-related events and incidents. Security operations is a new use case for APM and observability in this edition of the Critical Capabilities. Application vulnerabilities are responsible for many high-profile breaches and intrusions, and the trace telemetry collected by APM and observability solutions includes valuable security signals. The Log4Shell incident in late 2021, where a long-standing but recently discovered vulnerability was widely exploited, demonstrated the value of these security capabilities.

**Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM)**
DEM is associated with multiple roles in organizations that use APM and observability tools to understand application performance and usability characteristics. DEM technologies monitor availability, performance, and experience quality as end users interact with applications and supporting infrastructure. Users can be external consumers of a service (such as patrons of a retail website), internal employees accessing corporate tools (such as a benefits management system), or a combination of both. DEM technologies observe and model user behavior as a continuous flow of interactions in the form of user journeys.

**DevOps/AppDev**
DevOps release teams must rapidly assess the quality and effectiveness of recent releases to detect and diagnose issues quickly. This often requires in-depth data sourced from multiple, integrated tools. DevOps teams also help plan for future requirements and assess the impact of recently performed or planned application or infrastructure changes. Application developers increasingly make APM buying decisions due to changes in how IT teams support the development and deployment of applications.
