# Spatio-Temporal Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Models

## 1. Introduction
In this paper, we present several spatio-temporal role-based access control (RBAC) models based on the RBAC96 and ERBAC07 standards. We introduce a graph-based formalism to explain the semantics of RBAC96 and use it as a foundation for defining the semantics of our spatio-temporal models. This approach aims to address the shortcomings of existing spatio-temporal RBAC models, which suffer from poorly defined authorization semantics, complex and inadequate syntax, lack of compatibility with the RBAC96/ANSI-RBAC standard, and inconsistency.

## 2. Spatio-Temporal Enabling Conditions
### 2.1 Concrete Example
- **Concrete Domains:**
  - r1, r2, r3, r4, p1, p2, p3, p4
  - Spatial constraints: [(0,0), (80,30)]
  - Temporal constraints: 09:00-17:59, Always
- **Role Hierarchy:**
  - CB (Computing Building)
  - SR ∪ AO ∪ BO (Spatial Regions ∪ Access Objects ∪ Business Objects)

### 2.2 Graphical Representation
- **Figure 2: Spatio-temporal RBAC Example**
  - Illustrates the spatial and temporal enabling conditions for roles and permissions.
- **Figure 3: Graphical Formulation of ERBAC+**
  - Shows the spatio-temporal domains and their relationships.

## 3. Existing Work and Shortcomings
### 3.1 GTRBAC Model
- **Base Case and Circular Definitions:**
  - The base case for permission acquisition is not clearly defined, leading to potential circular definitions.
  - Enabling conditions on intermediate roles are ignored, causing conflicts in the specification.

### 3.2 Ray and Toahchoodee's Model
- **Spatio-temporal Constraints:**
  - Introduces spatial and temporal constraints on all components of RBAC.
  - Consistency issues arise when enabling conditions are applied to roles and permissions.

### 3.3 Other Related Work
- **Spatial Constraints in MAC and DAC:**
  - Studies have been conducted on spatial constraints in mandatory and discretionary access control models.
- **GEO-RBAC and GEO-HRBAC:**
  - Comprehensive spatial RBAC models that treat locations as objects and define role hierarchies based on location containment.
- **Contextual Information in RBAC:**
  - Various approaches, such as TeaM-based access control (TMAC) and context constraints, have been proposed to incorporate general contextual information into RBAC.

## 4. Proposed Approach
### 4.1 Flat RBAC+ST
- **Spatio-temporal Constraints:**
  - Encodes spatio-temporal constraints using flat RBAC+ST.
  - Avoids imposing enabling constraints on roles; instead, applies them to users and user-role assignments.
- **Graph-Based Formalism:**
  - Uses a graph-based formalism to define the semantics of RBAC96 and spatio-temporal models.
  - Simplifies the evaluation of access requests by pre-computing enabling conditions on the transitive closure of the RBAC graph.

## 5. Future Work
### 5.1 Spatio-temporal Separation of Duty
- **Formal Classification:**
  - Classify various spatio-temporal separation of duty constraints.
  - Propose efficient mechanisms for enforcing these constraints.

### 5.2 Extension to Partially Ordered Sets
- **Generalization:**
  - Extend the model to any partially ordered set of entity attributes, not just space and time.
  - Example: Security clearances associated with different security domains within an organization.
