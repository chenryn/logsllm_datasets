**Audit Report: Review of Web Applications Security and Intrusion Detection in Air Traffic Control Systems**

**KPMG Methodology**
KPMG's detailed methodology is documented in their report. The following summarizes the contractor’s scope and methodology:

1. **External Vulnerability Assessment/Penetration Test:**
   - Conducted using open-source (freeware) and commercial scanning software.
   - Performed through an Internet connection at KPMG Headquarters.
   - Based on OIG input, a total of 35 publicly accessible web application computers were included in the test.

2. **Internal Vulnerability Assessment/Penetration Test:**
   - Conducted using open-source and commercial scanning software.
   - Performed at FAA Headquarters.
   - Based on OIG input, a total of 35 internal web application computers were included in the test.
   - To minimize potential impact on ATC operations, a portion of the test was conducted at night.

**OIG Staff Visits and Interviews:**
- OIG staff visited the FTI Security Operations Control Center in Melbourne, Florida, and the DOT CSMC in Leesburg, Virginia.
- They interviewed center officials, examined available data related to identified cyber incidents, and reviewed intrusion-detection monitoring policies and procedures.

**Audit Period and Standards:**
- The audit work was performed between June 2008 and January 2009.
- The audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, which require planning and performing the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for findings and conclusions based on the audit objectives.
- We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

**Appendix A: Management Comments**

**Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Memorandum**

**Date:** April 16, 2009  
**To:** Rebecca C. Leng, Assistant Inspector General for Financial and Information Technology Audits  
**From:** Ramesh K. Punwani, Assistant Administrator for Financial Services/CFO  
**Prepared by:** Anthony Williams, x79000  
**Subject:** OIG Draft Report: Review of Web Applications Security and Intrusion Detection in Air Traffic Control Systems

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) appreciates the efforts of the Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) in the subject draft report, which will assist the FAA in identifying previously undetected weaknesses in the FAA web infrastructure.

**Cybersecurity Priorities:**
- Cybersecurity is a key component of the safe operation of the National Air Space System (NAS) and is a top priority for the FAA, as outlined in the FAA Flight Plan.
- The Air Traffic Organization (ATO) places the highest priority on maintaining a safe and secure Air Traffic Control (ATC) system.
- ATO recognizes that constant vigilance and effective, expeditious action are essential for addressing cybersecurity in ATC systems.

**Steps Taken by ATO:**
- Implementation of a comprehensive Information System Security (ISS) Program in support of FISMA requirements.
- Separation of NAS operational ATC systems from Mission Support and Administrative systems.
- Identification and prioritized fixing of cybersecurity weaknesses, with expedited processes for high-priority issues.
- Modernization of ATO cybersecurity through improvements in processes and technology.

**Network Infrastructure:**
- The FAA networking infrastructure consists of two major networks:
  - **FAA Administrative/ATC Mission Support (Admin/MS) Network:** Provides Wide Area Network (WAN) support to FAA services, except ATC operations.
  - **National Airspace System (NAS) Network:** Provides WAN services that support ATC operations. ATC systems are prohibited from directly connecting to the FAA Admin/MS Network or any other non-NAS network.

**OIG Findings and Recommendations:**
- The OIG report focuses on vulnerabilities associated with Admin/MS system assets.
- The OIG used commercially available scanning tools to assess the security of the Admin/MS elements of the ATO infrastructure, and vulnerabilities were identified.
- The FAA will address these vulnerabilities with diligence, prioritizing high and moderate risk vulnerabilities in public-facing websites and mission support services.

**Recommendations and Responses:**

1. **Ensure Compliance with Government Security Standards:**
   - **Response:** Concur. The FAA will ensure that all web applications used in ATC systems are configured in compliance with government security standards. The FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) NAS IP WAN has intrusion-detection-system (IDS) sensors deployed, and additional IDS sensors will be installed at identified demarcation points. Vulnerabilities will be addressed through the ATO Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Remediation Management process.

2. **Strengthen Patch Management:**
   - **Response:** Concur. The FAA will identify web applications with known vulnerabilities and promptly install relevant security patches. The ATO ISS Program Compliance/Audit Plan ensures that web applications are configured in accordance with DOT Secure Web Application Standards.

3. **Correct High-Risk Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Response:** Concur. The FAA will take immediate action to correct high-risk vulnerabilities and establish a timetable for remediation of all remaining identified vulnerabilities. The review of vulnerabilities will be completed by April 30, 2009, and a timetable for remediation will be developed by July 31, 2009.

4. **Resolve Differences with CSMC and Deploy IDS Monitoring Devices:**
   - **Response:** Concur. The FAA will meet with CSMC leadership to discuss and improve interactions. Actions are underway to complete the network of IDS monitoring systems, and additional IDS sensors will be installed at identified demarcation points.

5. **Establish Procedures for Timely Remediation of Cyber Incidents:**
   - **Response:** Concur. The ATO has implemented process improvements to reduce the number of open incidents and improve timely response to cyber incidents. The CSMC and ATO are working together to refine the process of identifying the criticality of information for event remediation, with a refined process to be developed by August 2009.

**Table 1: Internet-based and Internal Security Testing Results**
- 35 Internet-based or public use web applications were tested, revealing 212 high-risk, 169 medium-risk, and 1,037 low-risk vulnerabilities.
- 35 internal or FAA-use web applications were tested, revealing 551 high-risk, 335 medium-risk, and 1,553 low-risk vulnerabilities.
- In total, 70 web applications were tested, with 763 high-risk, 504 medium-risk, and 2,590 low-risk vulnerabilities found.

**Figure 1: Air Traffic Control Internet Protocol Based Network Infrastructure**
- The infrastructure primarily consists of the backbone FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure and several local area networks.
- ATC systems are hosted on local area networks at ATC facilities, which have connections to both FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure operational and mission-support networks.

**Table 2: Cyber Security Management Center (CSMC) Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) Sensor Coverage**
- For en route centers, 21 facilities have no IDS sensors on the ATC network but 5 on the mission-support network.
- For terminal radar approach control facilities, 166 facilities have no IDS sensors on the ATC network but 4 on the mission-support network.
- For airport traffic control towers, 512 facilities have no IDS sensors on the ATC network.
- For flight service stations, 33 facilities have no IDS sensors on either network.
- For the FAA Technical Center and Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, each has 1 facility with no IDS sensors on the ATC network but 1 on the mission-support network.
- For remote sites, the number of facilities is in the thousands, with no IDS sensors on either network.
- In total, excluding remote sites, 734 major ATC facilities have no IDS sensors on the ATC network but 11 on the mission-support network.
