### Load Measurement and Client Distribution

The load experienced by each Mesh Access Point (MAP) is quantified, and the distribution of clients across these MAPs helps in identifying "client hotspots." This information is crucial for deploying additional MAPs in high-demand regions to ensure an even distribution of load across all access points. In Figure 17, we present the average number of clients connected to each MAP over the study period. The MAPs are sorted in descending order based on the average number of clients. Our observations indicate that certain MAPs are significantly more popular than others, with the average number of clients ranging from around 7 to less than 1. The figure also displays the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles of the number of clients and the corresponding number of MAPs to which these clients are connected. For instance, approximately 50% of the clients are connected to the 40 most popular MAPs, which represent only 20% of the total deployed MAPs. Additionally, many MAPs in the mesh network are lightly loaded, with about 110 MAPs having an average of fewer than one user connected.

### Spatial Distribution of Clients

In Figure 2, we illustrate the spatial distribution of clients using the mesh network, where each MAP is represented by a circle. The size of the circle corresponds to the average number of clients connected to the MAP. This visualization clearly highlights the uneven distribution of clients across the coverage area. Notably, the most popular MAPs (those with a higher average number of clients) are concentrated in a specific region near downtown. Within this region, we observe the formation of several clusters, particularly in areas B2, B3, and B4. Area B2, which contains several student dormitories, explains its popularity. Area B3, known for its numerous coffee shops and restaurants, is also highly frequented. Area B4, featuring an open park with significant student activity, is another hotspot.

### Hop Count and Number of Clients

The distribution of clients across different hops in the network provides insights into the quality of the deployment. In a well-planned deployment, most clients should be within a few hops. If there are popular MAPs at higher hop counts, network planners may deploy a Root Access Point (RAP) in the area to reduce the hop count. Figure 9 shows the distribution of clients across different hops in the deployed mesh network. We find that approximately 15% of the clients are directly connected to RAPs, and among the other MAPs, the number of clients decreases with an increase in hop count. Specifically, about 85% of the clients are connected to the network within three hops. This distribution is similar to the distribution of MAPs (Figure 8), as a large fraction of the deployed MAPs are also at lower hop counts.

### Distribution of MAPs with High Packet Losses

We observed that some MAPs experienced packet error rates exceeding 35%. Further investigation revealed that these MAPs typically had very few clients connected to them. MAPs with similar packet error rates were often clustered together, indicating regions of high and low interference on the access links. For example, MAPs in area B4, which is an open park, experienced very low packet losses. Conversely, MAPs with higher packet error rates were clustered near area B3, where other WiFi networks caused significant interference.

### Related Work

This section summarizes previous research on wireless network deployments. A substantial body of work has been conducted on evaluating the performance characteristics of wireless networks. Studies by Kotz et al. [20, 21] use SNMP traces to analyze the performance of campus-wide WLAN networks, focusing on usage patterns and temporal variations. Aguayo et al. [11] report on the link-level characteristics of an 802.11b rooftop-based mesh network in an urban setting. Chebrolu et al. [12] and Sheth et al. [9] study outdoor mesh networks, but their work is applicable to rural settings. Our study, conducted on a commercial mesh network, presents results on the quality of deployment, application-level performance, and link-level characteristics.

Knightly et al. [9] highlight the importance of measurements in planning and provisioning mesh networks. Their deployment operates exclusively in the 2.4 GHz band, while ours uses both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The scale of our MadMesh network (250 nodes) is significantly larger than their 18-node deployment. Table 2 contrasts our study with prior work, emphasizing the unique features: a larger scale, dual-band operation, and commercial nature.

At the time of publication, two independent studies evaluated aspects of a metropolitan-area mesh network: Knightly et al. [22] estimated the coverage properties of the Google WiFi mesh network in Mountain View, CA, and Afanasyev et al. [23] analyzed usage characteristics for different device classes in the same network, focusing on application workloads, mobility patterns, and device popularity. These studies complement our work, providing a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of metro-area WiFi meshes.

### Conclusion

This paper presents the first systematic study of a commercial-grade wireless mesh network in an urban setting. We find that the planned backbone of the network performs better than the access side, primarily due to unmitigated interference in the 2.4 GHz spectrum. The study also provides valuable statistics on actual usage, which can inform future deployments to enhance profitability. We offer several lessons to improve future deployments, including better architectural design to mitigate interference, mechanisms to detect topology robustness, strategies to reduce route flapping, and the use of client feedback in network management.
