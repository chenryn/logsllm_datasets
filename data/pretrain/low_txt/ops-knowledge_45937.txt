To enable Remote Desktop Services on a Windows server, please follow these detailed steps:

1. **Log in with Administrator Privileges**: Ensure that you have logged into the Windows server with an account that has administrator privileges.
   
2. **Open Server Manager**: You can do this by searching for "Server Manager" in the Start menu or by right-clicking the Start button and selecting it from the context menu.

3. **Access Roles Section**:
   - In the left-hand pane of Server Manager, click on “Roles” to expand the roles section.
   - If you don’t see the “Roles” option, ensure that you are using a version of Windows Server that supports this feature (e.g., Windows Server 2012 or later).

4. **Add Remote Desktop Services Role**:
   - In the main Server Manager dashboard, look for the “Add roles and features” link and click on it.
   - This will open the Add Roles and Features Wizard. Click “Next” until you reach the “Select server roles” page.
   - Check the box next to “Remote Desktop Services”. A pop-up may appear asking if you want to add required features; select “Add Features” and then click “Next”.

5. **Select Role Services**:
   - On the “Select role services” page, check the boxes for “Remote Desktop Session Host” and “Remote Desktop Licensing”.
   - Click “Next” and then “Install” to begin the installation process.

6. **Complete Installation**:
   - Wait for the installation to complete. Once finished, you will be prompted to close the wizard.

7. **Configure Remote Desktop Services**:
   - After installation, return to the Server Manager dashboard. You should see a notification about configuring Remote Desktop Services.
   - Click on the notification to start the Remote Desktop Services configuration wizard. Follow the prompts to configure the settings as needed.

8. **Enable Firewall Rules**:
   - Ensure that port 3389 (the default RDP port) is allowed through the firewall. You can do this by opening the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security and adding a new inbound rule for port 3389.

9. **Test the Connection**:
   - Once the configuration is complete, start the Remote Desktop Services and attempt to log in remotely from another machine to verify that everything is working correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully enable and configure Remote Desktop Services on your Windows server.
