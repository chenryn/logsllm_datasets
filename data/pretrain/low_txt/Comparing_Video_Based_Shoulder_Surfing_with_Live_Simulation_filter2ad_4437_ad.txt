### Statistical Differences in NPAT Results

When examining the previously presented results for NPAT, we observe no significant differences when comparing within a collection method and authentication, specifically between left and right angles. This finding contrasts with prior research. However, it is important to note that the top observation angle was removed, and the two near and far angles were reduced to a single side angle (L or R). Given that the two comparable subsets are consistent, we can confirm that under H4-p, the live settings are well predicted by a comparable subset of video data.

### Passcode Properties (H1-r/H5-p)

Table 8 presents a direct comparison of each passcode used in the study, using single view data, along with the findings from proportionality tests between the live and video settings. We find that there are no significant differences for the PAT and NPAT codes. Only three PIN codes—5962, 159428, and 366792—show differences, with the live setting attacker performance being significantly better in each case. The spatial properties of these codes (detailed in Appendix B.2) do not suggest a single factor as the cause. Although both 5962 and 366792 are right-shifted PINs, multiple other features are at play, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.

Using a χ² test for within-collection method analysis across the passcodes, we find significant differences in the attacker success rate for both the live and video studies, for all authentication types. Post-hoc analysis reveals that none of the NPAT pairwise comparisons are significant, and only one set of PAT pairwise comparisons (743521 vs. 3157) is significant. Specifically, 743521 was the most challenging pattern to shoulder surf. For PINs, post-hoc analysis again shows that 159428 and 366792 have significant comparisons, particularly with PINs 7272 and 1955, which were among the easiest PINs to shoulder surf, compared to 159428 and 366792, which were among the most difficult.

Finally, we compare the impact of length on PAT. We do not see significant differences in success rates between 4- and 6-length patterns in the live study (χ² = 2.9, p = 0.09), but we do in the video study (χ² = 12.83, p < 0.001).

### Methodological Details

In our analysis, only data where the time taken to enter the passcode exceeded 1800 milliseconds was included, and the "top" angle was excluded. A 2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction was used, and the χ² statistic, p-value, and 95% confidence interval (δ95) of the difference between the proportions (live - video) are reported.

### Participant Feedback

One advantage of the live study is the ability to directly observe participants' strategies and the relative difficulties they encounter, as well as through post-hoc questions (detailed in Appendix A.2). While there is no direct comparison to the Aviv et al. prior work, we believe the strategies likely mirror those used by participants in the video study to some extent.

The most commonly reported strategy (n=16) was focusing on memorizing the passcode as it appeared and then writing it down immediately after it was completely entered. Only three participants reported strategies involving writing or physically mirroring the input gesture while it was happening. Other participants (n=2) described "chunking" PINs into larger numbers (e.g., "seventeen" versus "one-seven") in their first languages (Farsi and Chinese) to facilitate quick memorization. Five participants mentioned watching the readout field in the PIN conditions, while others preferred to watch only the finger gesture as it was performed.

Participants highlighted several factors that made PIN and grid passcodes challenging to record accurately. These included grid pattern shapes that crossed over themselves or contained knight moves (n=11, e.g., 743521 and 4572, Figure 4), long physical jumps between sequential PIN digits (n=3), and sequential digits that were physically close together (n=7). Ten participants reported that viewing from the right was harder because their view of the phone screen was partially blocked by the victim-proctor's thumb in a right-handed grip, which is supported by the data, particularly for NPAT results. Six participants also felt that glare from overhead lighting was sometimes an issue.

Other passcode features and conditions were described as helpful. Four participants mentioned that it was easier to memorize shapes that they could easily associate with a visual image, such as 136785 as a house or 842157 as a picnic table (Figure 4).

Finally, multiple observations of the same passcode were commonly deemed helpful for confirming or piecing together sequences, although one participant stated that it was easier to do this if both observations were made from the same side. This is supported by the quantitative data.

### Implications

#### Importance of Evaluating in Appropriate Settings

Researchers often prefer to perform studies examining observational attacks using video-based stimuli. While these studies are simpler to coordinate and control compared to live settings, they can lack realism and are considered a methodological substitute only when necessary [27]. Our findings suggest that researchers evaluating authentication interfaces should be aware that there is no substitute for testing in live settings, as the video baseline may greatly underestimate the threat of an attacker. The video baseline may serve as a method for a preliminary assessment.

#### Factors to Consider in Observational Attack Studies

While factors such as authentication type and repeated views can impact attack rates, as evidenced by our study, other factors are worthy of further investigation. Examples include the impact of observational angle and the spatial properties of passcodes and device screen sizes. Although significant differences in some of these factors could not always be detected, subjective feedback from participant observers suggested that these factors could make a difference in attacker success. Examining these in more detail, alongside gathering subjective data to identify reasoning, is recommended for researchers, as these factors may play a greater role than previously thought.

#### Care in Selection of Passcode

Our results suggest that specific types and properties of passcodes may be more susceptible to observational attacks, as identified through the comparison with live settings. Users should be aware that removing the feedback lines from pattern unlock interfaces may not provide the expected security benefits. Additionally, PINs are more susceptible to attack than previously identified by researchers performing video-based studies. This is also supported by our qualitative feedback, where participants noted that PINs with larger jumps were harder to attack, and for PAT/NPAT, those that are less "shape-like" (e.g., resembling a house-like shape) are harder for participants to remember.

#### Need for Training

As our findings highlight that observational attacks are more successful under specific conditions, security training for mobile device users can be developed to better understand the nature of observational threats, encouraging them to make better security choices. Some users may need to better understand what methods and parameters would provide resilience against high-probability multiple-view observation attacks mounted by "insider threats" [28]. Others might want authentication factors that are easier to use if they perceive less risk of observational attack. Better informing these choices could come in the form of interactive guidance/prompting when setting up devices.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we describe a study comparing video recreations of shoulder surfing to live simulation. We recreated a subset of the factors explored in the video study and attempted to confirm prior findings in this setting. We confirmed many of the prior claims regarding the video study, that authentication type, repeated viewings, observation angle, and passcode properties can affect attacker performance. We also confirmed that the video study forms a baseline for the live simulation; however, this baseline may be much lower than desired, with a difference of up to 1.9x. From these findings, we suggest that for researchers conducting shoulder surfing studies with video components, the data can form a baseline and be representative in many situations of what would occur in a live simulation. However, when possible, those results should be compared to a live simulation to get a fuller picture of the data and results.
