## Abstract
We present a method for identifying whether a Twitter account exhibits automated behavior in publishing tweets. This approach utilizes only the publicly available timestamp information associated with each tweet. After evaluating its effectiveness, we apply it to analyze the Twitter landscape, finding that 16% of active accounts show a high degree of automation. Additionally, 11% of accounts that appear to publish exclusively through the browser are, in fact, automated accounts that spoof the source of the updates.

## 1. Introduction
Twitter is a microblogging service allowing users to publish short status updates, known as tweets. With over 180 million monthly visitors generating 55 million tweets per day, user accounts and their updates are public by default, accessible via Twitter’s two application programming interfaces (APIs). The large user base, low privacy expectations, and easy-to-use API have made Twitter a target for abuse, ranging from spam and disruptive marketing tactics to more malicious activities like malware distribution and phishing schemes. Often, such abuse involves automation for actions like posting tweets, following users, and sending private messages.

Previous research on Twitter has focused on the properties of the social network, user characteristics, and social interactions, but not specifically on automation. In this work, we introduce a technique to determine whether a Twitter account uses automation to publish tweets, based on fine-grained periodicities in tweet timestamps. Our method can also detect legitimate accounts compromised by spammers using automation. We evaluate the test's effectiveness, discuss its limitations, and examine the prevalence of automation across various aspects of Twitter.

## 2. Background and Measurement Data
Tweets are short messages (limited to 140 characters) posted to a Twitter account using a browser, standalone application, API, or SMS. Each tweet includes the creation time and the source of the update. Users can subscribe to another account's tweets by following it, receiving updates through the main timeline on the Twitter website, third-party applications, or SMS. Accounts have two privacy settings: public (visible to all) and protected (visible only to approved followers).

Twitter's "Verified Account" program allows individuals and companies to confirm their identity, though it is limited to a select few. Twitter is a real-time communication service, featuring trending topics prominently to highlight current discussions. These trends are determined by algorithms and made available through APIs.

Twitter provides two APIs: the REST API for reading and writing data, and the Search API for querying tweets and obtaining trending topics. Authentication can be done using basic credentials or OAuth, allowing third-party applications to access user data.

For our study, we define an account that publishes a significant portion of its tweets automatically as a bot. We refer to human-generated tweets as manual or organic.

### Data Used in the Study
We used public data from 106,573 distinct accounts over three weeks in April 2010, focusing on public accounts. The REST API returns up to 3,200 tweets per account, with 200 updates per call. We analyzed a maximum of 300 tweets per account to avoid API timeouts. Each tweet includes a timestamp, follower count, privacy settings, client source, and verification status.

## 3. Detecting Tweet Automation
Our detector is based on the premise that highly automated accounts will exhibit timing patterns different from those of non-automated users. Specifically, human users post updates without regard to the exact second or minute, resulting in a uniform distribution of tweet times. Figure 1 shows typical timing graphs for human and automated accounts.

Automated accounts may exhibit non-uniform or hyper-uniform timing due to job schedulers, limits on tweet frequency, or delay-based automation. We use Pearson's χ² test to assess whether a set of update times is consistent with the expected uniform distribution. A p-value below 0.001 or above 0.999 indicates non-uniform or hyper-uniform behavior, respectively.

### Testing for Automated Behavior
We use a two-sided significance level of 0.001 (0.1%) to minimize false positives. For 300 timestamps, we use 60 bins; for fewer, we use 6 bins, excluding accounts with fewer than 30 tweets. We perform separate χ² tests for seconds-of-the-minute and minutes-of-the-hour, with a failure in either indicating automation.

## 4. Evaluating the Test
We lack ground truth for account automation, but initial evaluations of 18,147 accounts showed 975 with p-values < 0.001 and 15 with p-values > 0.999 for seconds-of-the-minute. For minutes-of-the-hour, 2,599 had p-values < 0.001 and 76 had p-values > 0.999. Manual examination confirmed clear non-uniform or hyper-uniform behavior, and hybrid accounts were identified using different applications for manual and automatic updates.

### False Positives and Negatives
False positives can occur due to legitimate organic use with non-uniform timing, such as a student posting between classes. False negatives are likely higher due to hybrid behavior and uniformly distributed automated accounts. Evasion is possible by mimicking organic posting patterns, but there is currently no incentive for automated accounts to do so.

## 5. Analyzing Twitter’s Landscape
Using the χ² test, we analyzed public tweets and accounts to determine the prevalence of automation. We sampled the public timeline and search results, and obtained accounts from static lists. Table 1 summarizes our results, showing varying degrees of automation across different facets of the Twitter landscape.

### Table 1: Automation Testing Results
| Category                | Total Accounts | Passed | Failed |
|-------------------------|----------------|--------|--------|
| Public timeline accounts| 19,436         | 15,330 | 2,817  |
| Public timeline tweets   | 18,331         | 14,790 | 2,475  |

Our analysis does not account for temporal variations in automation, which may require longer-term monitoring. Future work will address these considerations.
