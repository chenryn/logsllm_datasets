### Sound in Security Research

**Date:** August 2019  
**Title:** Sound Effects: Exploring Acoustic Cyber-Weapons  
**Organization:** PwC

#### Previous Work
- **Brown Note**
- **Paranormal Experiences** (Tandy, 2000; Parsons et al., 2008)
- **US Embassy in Cuba** (Leighton, 2018)

#### Acoustic Weapons - FAQs
- **Misunderstandings and Practical Issues** (Muhlhans, 2017; Vinokur, 2004; Altmann, 2001)
  - Threshold shifts are likely not of interest to attackers.
  - It is challenging to cause targeted, directional effects.
  - **Low-Frequency Noise (LFN):** High propagation, low directionality, and size restrictions.
  - **High-Frequency Noise (HFN):** Low propagation, size restrictions.
  - Close proximity and rapid diffusion are necessary (Bartholomew & Perez, 2018).

#### Our Experiment
- **Hypothesis:**
  - HFN and LFN may be imperceptible to a subset of the population.
  - Above certain levels, they may cause adverse effects.
  - Some consumer equipment can emit HFN and LFN.
  - An attacker could develop malware or attacks to:
    - Cause a device to emit HFN or LFN.
    - Emit these at levels exceeding maximum permissible guidelines.
    - Potentially cause adverse effects.

- **Experiment Outline:**
  - Develop attacks and malware to control volume and speaker output in consumer devices.
  - Play/stream tones at a set of high and low frequencies.
  - Measure output with a sound level meter.
  - Compare output to maximum permissible levels.

- **Ethics:**
  - No human subjects involved.
  - Ethics exemption granted by UCL Ethics Committee.
  - Full risk assessment conducted.
  - Safety precautions: ear defenders, anechoic chamber.
  - Brands, models, and code not released to minimize risk.

- **Attack Scenarios:**
  - **Employee Performance:** Attacker seeks to affect the performance of employees/staff.
  - **Organizational Impact:** Attacker aims to affect the performance of an organization at scale.
  - **Targeted Harassment:** Campaigns targeting specific individuals.
  - **Low-Grade Cyber-Weapons:** Potential use as low-grade cyber-weapons.

- **Test Environment:**
  - Tones embedded in various modes (local and remote).
  - Volume increased to 100% during the attack and then lowered to the original level.
  - **Windows PoC Malware:** Local and remote modes, volume control.
  - **PoC Android Malware:** Local and remote modes, volume control.
  - **Smart Speaker:** Known vulnerability to control audio, local network or DNS rebinding attack, Python script to scan and stream tones.
  - **Headphones:** Over-ear design, connected via Bluetooth, placed close to the sound level meter.
  - **Vibration & Bluetooth Speakers:** Vibration speakers with no diaphragm cone, paired over Bluetooth.
  - **Parametric Speakers:** Ultrasonic carrier waves, high-intensity directional audio, low profile and cost, directional properties.
  - **Vehicle-Mounted PA System:** Autoplays audio from an inserted storage device (USB/SD).

- **Additional Attacks:**
  - **HTML5 Audio Tag:** Autoplay on site visit, now disabled in some browsers.
  - **Manipulation of Audio:** Various methods to manipulate audio output.

- **Measurement:**
  - Class I sound level meters used for precision.
  - Devices placed in an anechoic chamber.
  - Sine wave tones played at 44.1kHz sample rate.
  - Each tone played for 10 minutes.
  - Surface temperature measured before and after the attack.
  - Z-weighting and proprietary high-pass filter weighting used for different frequency ranges.

- **Results:**
  - **High-Frequency Noise (HFN)**
  - **Low-Frequency Noise (LFN)**
  - **Other Results:**
    - Vibration speaker continuously fell over due to excessive vibration.
    - Smart speaker emitted a burning smell and was permanently damaged.

- **Disclosure:**
  - Reported to manufacturers who were responsive and cooperative.
  - Updates rolled out to address the issue.

- **Implications:**
  - **Headphones:**
    - Increasingly used, especially by young people at high volumes.
    - Device-agnostic, variations of laptop/phone malware could be adapted.
    - Only trigger sound when headphones are connected.
    - Audio manipulation attack could also succeed with headphones.
  - **Parametric Speakers:**
    - Attractive as portable, low-cost acoustic weapons.
    - Use in public may constitute significant health risks.
  - **LFN:**
    - Could be used to produce LFN consistent with annoyance.
