#### About the Talk

**Cloud Security Challenges and Benefits**
- Specifically, using IaaS automation and orchestration features to enhance security.

**Cloud Attack Vectors**
- Provider administration
- Management console
- Multi-tenancy and virtualization
- Automation and API
- Supply chain
- Side-channel attacks
- Insecure instances

**Anatomy of a Cloud Hack: The BrowserStack Story**
- Shell shock vulnerability on an unused server
- Found API key on the hacked server
- Used the API key to open a firewall rule and launch an instance
- Attached a backup volume to the instance
- Found database credentials on the backup device
- Connected to the database

**Micro-Services Architecture**
- DevOps and Continuous Delivery
- Reducing deployment times from hours to minutes
- Changing architecture and deployments
- Shorter billing cycles
- Google and Microsoft slashing cloud platform prices

**How to Ensure Security When Servers Live for 10 Minutes?**
- Patch management
- Maintenance windows
- Periodic vulnerability scanning
- Hardening

**Introducing Cloudefigo**
- Based on work by Rich Mogull from Securosis
- **Source:** [Cloudefigo GitHub](https://github.com/securosis)

**Cloudefigo Lifecycle**
1. **Server Launch**
   - Server loads security configuration
   - Server encrypts disk volumes
   - Server is scanned for vulnerabilities
   - Server moves to production

2. **Components**
   - Object Storage
   - Vulnerability Scanner
   - Cloud-Init
   - Configuration Management
   - IAM Roles
   - Volume Encryption

3. **Instant Lifecycle**
   - Launch
   - Update
   - Control
   - Scan
   - Production
   - Terminate

**Key Features**
- Each machine manages its own attributes (e.g., encryption keys, remediation vs. production groups)
- Dynamic IAM roles required during launch and production phases
- Root permissions for CloudInit execution
- CloudInit updates and upgrades software packages
- Installation of necessary software (Python, Boto, Chef Client, PyChef)
- Download configurations and scripts from S3
- Creation and attachment of a volume for application files and data

**Control and Encryption**
- Chef client registration with the Chef Management server
- Policy enforcement on the instance
- Key storage and management
- Dynamic S3 policies for secure key access

**Vulnerability Scanning**
- Automatic vulnerability scan launched by CloudInit script
- Analysis of scan results by Cloudefigo script
- Instance moved to production or remediation group based on scan results

**Production Phase**
- Least privileged role with read-only access
- Compensating controls for ongoing operations
- Alerts for unauthorized access key usage
- Setting CloudWatch alarms

**Termination**
- Server, attached volumes, and IAM role are terminated
- Data remains in backups/snapshots or provider storage
- Encryption keys deleted to ensure backup data remains inaccessible

**Wrapping Up**
- New software architecture and cloud applications disrupt traditional corrective controls
- Adopting new thinking to automate security
- Consider how security automation can help move your infrastructure forward, faster.
