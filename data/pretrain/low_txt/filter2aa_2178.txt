### Presentation Overview

**Introduction:**
- **Topic:** New concept for protecting data from memory scraping malware.
- **Live Demo:** The demo will run during the presentation, and we will check the results at the end.
- **Graphical Demonstration:** Available on Skimbad.com.
- **Source Code and EXE:** Available on GitHub.

**The Problem of Data Skimming Malware:**
- **High-Profile Cases:** Target breach with a 10% validity rate two years later.
- **Motivations:**
  - Carding and online ordering.
  - Duplicating cards for in-store use.
  - ATM cashouts using skimmed PINs.
  - Theft of resources (gas, food).
  - Theft of online services or licensed materials (digital movies, subscriptions).
  - Using card data to transfer money (Western Union runs).

**Data Exfiltration and Sale:**
- **Methods:**
  - USB devices to jump air-gapped systems.
  - Spear-phishing campaigns.
  - Classic hacking methods (USB, HID).
  - Batches sent to servers via POST requests.
  - Compiling dumps by BIN numbers and selling them on carding forums.
  - Validity rates typically over 98%.

**Initial Breach and Malware Loading:**
- **POS Terminal Breach:** Malware loads and sends swiped card data to a server.
- **Demo Setup:** All components run on one computer for demonstration purposes.

**Malware Detection:**
- **Custom Search Algorithms:** Differentiate credit card data from other data.
- **Other Uses:** Malware research.

**Approach to Stopping Breaches:**
- **Existing Solutions:** Current measures to stop skimming and data exfiltration.
- **New Concept:** Making batches unusable.
- **Random Credit Cards and Bins:**
  - How random card numbers are generated.
  - How random names are created.
  - Honeypot card numbers to detect breaches.
  - Anti-keystroke catching.

**Future of Malware and Countermeasures:**
- **Evolution:** Malware becoming smarter, detecting BINs from areas, and other methods.
- **Watchdog Protection:** Protecting against malware.
- **Making Batches Look Real:**
  - Covering legitimate credit cards with fakes.
  - Creating unscrubable fake batches.
- **Will Chip/Pin Stop Skimming?**

**Conclusion:**
- **Open Source Initiative:** Skimbad Software is free and open-source. Help make it better.
- **Integration:** This concept should be built into every POS system.

**Special Thanks:**
