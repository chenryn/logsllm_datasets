### Reflecting Small-Scale Changes in the Wireless Environment

Our model is designed to reflect small-scale changes in the wireless environment. However, the set of power levels must be recomputed for large-scale changes, such as transmitter mobility, the introduction of new physical obstacles, or new interference sources. We are investigating various triggering mechanisms to refresh the Model-TPC, although a simple strategy of refreshing the model every 10 minutes has proven effective in our indoor experiments.

### Experimental Evaluation of Model-TPC

To validate our model, we selected an existing algorithm [16] that uses transmit power control (TPC) to improve client throughput and spatial reuse. This algorithm increases the transmit power in steps and measures signal quality to determine the optimal power setting for a given client.

#### High-Level Operation

The algorithm starts with the lowest power level and performs normal data rate adaptation using Onoe [1], a standard data rate adaptation mechanism. Once the data rate stabilizes, the power level is increased, and the rate adaptation process continues. This process repeats until the transmitter reaches the maximum available rate or the highest power level.

#### Demonstrating Benefits

To demonstrate the benefits of our proposed model, we created a set of useful power levels through Model-TPC and restricted the algorithm to use only this set. We then compared the adaptation performance under two scenarios:
1. Using all possible power levels available from the wireless interface without Model-TPC.
2. Using the power levels provided by Model-TPC.

Model-TPC offers two main benefits:
1. **Faster Convergence**: It allows transmitters to converge more quickly to the best-suited power level in their operating environment.
2. **Higher Throughput**: By eliminating the need to explore many redundant power levels, which often result in poor throughput, the transmitters achieve higher overall throughput during the entire adaptation period. This is particularly important for mobile clients, which frequently need to adapt their transmission parameters, including power levels.

We illustrate these gains through our reference implementation of the algorithm in [16], both with and without Model-TPC.

### Experimental Setup

For the experiment, the setup was identical to the NLOS (Non-Line-of-Sight) scenario, with the transmitter using an Atheros card that has five validated power levels. The mobile client continuously transmitted data to a departmental server located at the position of receiver R2, as shown in Figure 2. The client roamed from locations T1 to T2 to T3, annotated in Figure 2 of our indoor WLAN deployment.

- **Initial Location (T1)**: The client had three feasible power levels (10mW, 20mW, and 40mW) as per Model-TPC.
- **Location T2**: The client moved close to the server (LOS), reducing its power level to 10mW to achieve a data rate of 54Mbps.
- **Final Location (T3)**: The client had four feasible power levels according to our empirical model.

We show the data rate and power adaptation process at T1 and T3. The adaptation at T2 is straightforward, with the client simply reducing power levels due to proximity to the server.

### Results

We present the cumulative distribution function of the instantaneous throughput (measured every 100 ms) for the two variants of the transmit power control algorithm in Figure 14. The results show that using Model-TPC to restrict power levels leads to higher instantaneous throughput for a significant part of the experiment, as illustrated in Figure 16.

- **Figure 15(a)**: Shows the adaptation behavior when all five power levels are used. The algorithm spends a significant amount of time testing redundant parameter values, impacting performance.
- **Figure 15(b)**: Shows the adaptation with Model-TPC, where convergence is much faster, especially at T1, where the difference between hardware and feasible power levels is more pronounced.

Model-TPC also provides better convergence when adapting from a high power level to a lower one, as seen at T2, by skipping redundant high power levels. Faster convergence reduces energy consumption and is crucial for mobile clients. Due to space constraints, we do not present the energy results in this section.

### Summary

Our experimental gains stem from the faster adaptation achievable when using Model-TPC as an input to power control. In our experiments, we compared the benefits when only five power levels were available from the wireless interface. The performance gains of Model-TPC would be even greater if more power levels were available, as it would increase the number of redundant channels that the transmitter would scan in a typical power control algorithm.

### Discussion

While our work focuses on indoor WLANs, it is relevant to cellular networks, where power control is a critical design parameter. Power control in cellular networks is used to reduce co-channel interference, manage voice quality, and handle fast fading and the near-far problem [11, 18]. However, cellular networks primarily operate in outdoor environments with less pronounced multipath effects. Additionally, cellular networks do not perform rate adaptation in the inner loop of power control, whereas data rate adaptation is an integral part of 802.11-based WLAN systems.

### Related Work

- **RF-Based Location Determination**: Mechanisms like those by Kaemarungsi et al. [13] use signal strength values for location fingerprinting in WLANs.
- **Feasibility Analysis**: Abdesslem et al. [9] describe hardware and software limitations that hinder the implementation of transmit power control mechanisms.

### Conclusions and Future Work

Multipath, fading, shadowing, and external interference make the implementation of power control mechanisms challenging. Our work shows that fine-grained power control is not effectively usable in a systematic manner. Instead, a few discrete power level choices (3-5) are sufficient for robust power control in typical indoor WLAN environments. We have built an empirical model to guide these choices, which can be used as a plug-in to previously proposed power control mechanisms.

Future work includes comparing NKLD with moment-based estimators for distinguishing between probability distributions and investigating various triggering mechanisms to refresh Model-TPC. We are also exploring location-specific power control approaches that can be implemented using a centralized controller in enterprise WLANs.
