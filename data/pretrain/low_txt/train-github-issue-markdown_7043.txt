### Environment Details
- **Dubbo Version:** master
- **Operating System:** Windows
- **Java Version:** 1.8

### Description
In the `ExtensionLoader` class, `EXTENSION_INSTANCES` is a `ConcurrentHashMap` with a default initial size. The number of extension classes provided by Dubbo exceeds 16. When the program starts, the map will need to be resized at least twice. 

To optimize performance, I suggest setting the initial capacity of `EXTENSION_INSTANCES` to 64. Additionally, other instances where `ConcurrentHashMap` is used should also be reviewed to ensure they have an appropriate initial size.
