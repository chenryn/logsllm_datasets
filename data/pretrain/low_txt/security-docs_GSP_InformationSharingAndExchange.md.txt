# Information Sharing and Exchange

The mission of Microsoft’s Government Security Program (GSP) is to build trust through transparency. Since its inception in 2003, the GSP has provided visibility into Microsoft's technology and security artifacts, allowing governments and international organizations to better protect themselves and their citizens. The Information Sharing and Exchange (ISE) offering facilitates the sharing and exchange of materials related to security threats, vulnerabilities, anomalous behavior, malware information, and security issues associated with Microsoft products and services. This offering leverages resources across the Microsoft environment to help governments safeguard citizens, infrastructure, and organizations.
