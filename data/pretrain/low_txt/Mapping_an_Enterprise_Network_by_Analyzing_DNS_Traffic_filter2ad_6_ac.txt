### Configuration and External Client Analysis
The number of external clients served by these hosts is very small, with fewer than 10 per recursive resolver, resulting in an average fraction near 0. Additionally, the number of external servers queried (numExtSrv) shows a reasonably high average value for recursive resolvers. Specifically, 14 and 4 hosts in the University and the research network, respectively, contribute to 84% and 80% of the total numExtSrv. This is expected as these hosts frequently communicate with public resolvers or authoritative name servers on the Internet.

### Mixed DNS Servers
Hosts classified as mixed DNS servers in both organizations exhibit a moderate value for the QryFracOut attribute: 0.57 for the University and 0.21 for the research network. This variation depends on their level of inbound and outbound DNS activity. In terms of external clients and servers, mixed servers fall between name servers and recursive resolvers. 

### Regular End-Hosts
Regular end-hosts generate only outbound DNS queries (QryFracOut equals 1), contact a small number of external resolvers, and are active for a shorter duration of time over a day (actvTimeFrac less than 0.5).

### Clustering Algorithm Output
Our clustering algorithm also generates a confidence level as an output, which can be used to measure the reliability of the classifier. If the attributes of an instance do not provide adequate information, the algorithm will classify it with a low confidence level. The average confidence level for the clustering results is 97.61% for both organizations, with more than 99% of instances classified with a confidence level greater than 85%. This indicates the strength of our host-level attributes, enabling the algorithm to cluster them with very high confidence.

### Server Clusters Over a Week
We now examine the performance of our clustering algorithm over a week. Figure 5 presents a heat map for server clusters. Columns list server hosts identified in Tables 2 and 3 (70 hosts in the University network and 22 hosts in the research network). Rows display the cluster into which each server is classified. The color of each cell represents the number of days (over a week) that each host is identified as the corresponding cluster—dark cells indicate a high number of occurrences (approaching 7), while bright cells represent a low occurrence closer to 0.

In the University network, we identified 42 name servers (H1 to H42 in Fig. 5(a)), most of which are consistently classified as name servers over a week, indicated by dark cells at their intersections with the bottom row. Among the 14 recursive resolvers (H43 to H56 in Fig. 5(a)), two are consistently classified as recursive resolvers, while the rest are classified as either mixed DNS servers or end hosts due to their varying activity. Lastly, 14 mixed servers (H57 to H70 in Fig. 5(a)) are consistently classified, though their behavior sometimes resembles that of a resolver or a name server.

Results from the Research Institute network are similar. Figure 5(b) shows that hosts H1-H12 are consistently classified as name servers, H13-H16 as recursive resolvers, and H17-H22 as mixed servers.

### Server Ranking
Our system discovered 5097 public-facing (non-DNS) servers in the University and 6102 at the Research Institute. However, only the top 368 and 271 of these servers, respectively, appeared in the answer section of more than 100 outgoing DNS responses over a day. Additionally, the top 6 ranked DNS servers in each organization contribute to more than 90% of outgoing queries and responses. Server ranking provides network operators with visibility into the criticality of their internal assets.

### IT Verification
IT departments of both organizations verified the top-ranked DNS resolvers, name servers, and non-DNS public-facing servers, as they are directly configured and controlled by the IT departments. We also revealed unknown servers configured by various departments, which were verified through reverse DNS lookup and IP range allocation by the IT departments. Interestingly, three of the name servers identified were implicated in a DNS amplification attack soon after, and IT confirmed that these were managed by affiliated entities (such as retail stores leasing space and Internet connectivity from the University). This highlights the use of our system in identifying and classifying assets whose security posture may not be directly controlled by network operators.

### Clustering of End-Hosts: NATed or Not?
To draw more insights, we applied our clustering algorithm to determine whether end-hosts are behind a NAT gateway or not (two clusters: NATed and not-NATed). In both networks, all WiFi clients are behind NAT gateways, and some specific departments use NAT for their wired clients. We verified our end-host clustering by reverse lookup for each enterprise network. Each NATed IP address has a corresponding domain name in specific forms configured by IT departments. For example, the University campus wireless NAT gateways are associated with domain names like "SSID-pat-pool-a-b-c-d.gw.univ-primary-domain," where "a.b.c.d" is the public IP address of the NAT gateway, and SSID is the WiFi SSID for the University campus network. Similarly, in the Research Institute, NAT gateways use names like "c-d.pool.rsch-primary-domain," where "c.d" is the last two octets of the public IP address of the NAT gateway.

On May 3rd, our end-host clustering showed that 292 and 19 end-host IP addresses were indeed NATed in the University campus and the Research Institute, respectively. We verified their corresponding domain names configured by their IT departments. The two clusters of end-hosts are primarily distinguished by the actvTimeFrac attribute—a NATed IP address (representing a group of end-hosts) is expected to have a longer duration of DNS activity compared to a not-NATed IP address (representing a single end-host). Some IPs with domain names of NAT gateways were incorrectly classified as not-NATed end-hosts due to their low daily DNS activity (less than an hour). Conversely, not-NATed end-hosts with long DNS activity (almost the whole day) were misclassified. Verifying end-hosts classified as NATed, 84.3% in the University campus and 86% in the Research Institute had corresponding domain names for NAT gateways allocated by IT departments. For end-hosts classified as not-NATed, 80.7% and 90.0% in the respective organizations did not map to any organizational domain names.

### Performance of End-Hosts Clustering Across a Week
Looking at the performance of end-hosts clustering over a week, 78.3% of end-hosts in the University campus were consistently labeled as NATed over 7 days. However, for the Research Institute, only 32.0% of NATed IPs were consistent across the entire week. 34.5% of IPs were absent on some days, and the remaining 33.4% were misclassified as not-NATed due to low activity (e.g., only active for 2 hours during a day).

### Related Work
DNS traffic has been analyzed for various purposes, ranging from measuring performance (e.g., the effect of Time-to-Live of DNS records) [3,7,13] to identifying malicious domains [2,8,9] and the security of DNS [5,10,11,14]. In this paper, we profiled the pattern of DNS traffic for individual hosts of two enterprise networks to map network assets to their function and identify their relative importance for efficient monitoring and security.

Studies related to malicious domains include [8], which inspects DNS traffic close to top-level domain servers to detect abnormal activity, and PREDATOR [9], which derives domain reputation using registration features to enable early detection of potentially malicious DNS domains without capturing traffic. From a security viewpoint, [5] studies the adoption of DNSSEC [1], highlighting that only 1% of domains have implemented this secure protocol due to difficulties in the registration process and operational challenges. [10,11] focus on authoritative name servers used as reflectors in DNS amplification attacks, and [14] reports that the amplification factor of DNSSEC is quite high (up to 44 to 55), whereas it is 6 to 12 for regular DNS servers.

DNS data can be collected from different locations (such as from log files of recursive resolvers [4,7] or authoritative name servers) or with different granularity (such as query/response logs or aggregated records). Datasets used in [5,10,11] contain DNS traffic for top-level domains such as .com and .net. We collect our data at the edge of an enterprise network, specifically outside the firewall at the point of interconnect with the external Internet. While using data from resolver logs can provide detailed information about end hosts and their query types/patterns, this approach limits visibility and may not be comprehensive enough to accurately establish patterns related to the assets of the entire network.

### Conclusion
Enterprise network administrators face challenges in tracking their assets and their network behavior. We developed an automated method to map internal hosts of an enterprise network by focusing on DNS traffic, which carries a wealth of information, constitutes a tiny fraction of total network traffic, and is easy to capture. By analyzing real-time live streams of DNS traffic from two organizations, we highlighted how DNS query and response patterns differ among recursive resolvers, authoritative name servers, and regular hosts. We then identified key DNS traffic attributes that can be extracted efficiently in real-time. Finally, we developed an unsupervised machine learning model that can classify enterprise assets and infer the type of an enterprise end-host (NATed or not-NATed). Our results have been verified with IT departments of the two organizations, revealing unknown knowledge.
