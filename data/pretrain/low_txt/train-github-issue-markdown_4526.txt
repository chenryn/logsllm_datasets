### Electron Version
12.0.5

### Operating System
Arch Linux

### Architecture
Other (please specify below)

### Last Known Working Electron Version
Not applicable

### Expected Behavior
Electron should not alter the default behavior of applications launched from within an Electron app.

### Actual Behavior
All Electron apps initiate additional third-party applications in xwayland mode. This results in conflicts for some applications. For example, if Firefox is already running and you click a link in an Electron app, Firefox will display the message: "Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To use Firefox, you must first close the existing Firefox process, restart your device, or use a different profile." This occurs because the xwayland version of Firefox cannot run inside a native Wayland session of Firefox.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Ensure you are in a Wayland session with xwayland support (e.g., GNOME). You can check this by running `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`.
2. Launch Firefox in Wayland mode using the command `MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 firefox`. (This may be the default on your distribution; you can verify this by checking the _about:support_ page after launching Firefox.)
3. Set Firefox as your default browser.
4. Launch an Electron application.
5. Click a link within the Electron application.
