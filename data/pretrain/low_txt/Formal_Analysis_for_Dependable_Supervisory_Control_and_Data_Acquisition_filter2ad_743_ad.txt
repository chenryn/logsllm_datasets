### Impact of the Problem Size

Figure 5(a) illustrates the execution time of the proposed resiliency framework for k-resilient observability verification, with respect to the problem size. The problem size is varied by considering different IEEE bus test systems. Since the SCADA system is randomly generated, we use at least three random inputs for each type of experiment, and each specific experiment is run at least five times. The execution time for each bus system is shown in Figure 5(a). We observe that the increase in execution time lies between linear and quadratic orders as the bus size increases.

For a specific bus size, the execution time differs between satisfiable (sat) and unsatisfiable (unsat) results, with the latter taking longer. A similar trend is observed for k-resilient secured observability verification (Figure 5(b)), although the time requirement is slightly higher. This is because the resiliency model needs to consider the constraints of secured communication, which increases the model size.

It is important to note that the problem size primarily depends on two topologies: bus topology and SCADA topology. The bus topology includes buses and power transmission lines, where the number of transmission lines has a quadratic order with respect to the number of buses. The SCADA topology includes Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), whose numbers are proportional to the number of buses. The number of communication lines also follows a quadratic order in terms of the number of SCADA devices. Therefore, the complexity of the problem generally has a quadratic upper bound with respect to the number of buses. However, an important feature of power grid networks is that the average degree of a node (or bus) is roughly 3, regardless of the number of buses in the system [9]. The degree of a node in the SCADA topology is also very low, which explains why the observed complexity is not strictly quadratic.

### Impact of the Hierarchy Level

We also analyzed the impact of the hierarchy level on the model execution time. Figures 6(a) and 6(b) present the evaluation results for the 14-bus and 57-bus test systems. The results show that the execution time decreases for satisfiable results but mostly increases for unsatisfiable results. This is because, with the increase in hierarchy, some RTUs become more important, and consequently, the threat space increases. As a result, the search time for a threat vector decreases. For unsatisfiable cases, the model needs to search the entire problem space, leading to increased execution time.

### C. Resiliency Analysis

#### Maximum Resiliency Analysis

We conducted experiments in different SCADA networks with respect to the number of measurements for the 14-bus system. The number of measurements is represented as a percentage of the maximum possible measurements for a bus system [10]. We varied the resiliency requirements with respect to the number of IED failures and RTU failures from smaller to larger values. The results show that the larger the number of measurements, the higher the maximum possible resiliency. Although this behavior depends on the SCADA network and the dependencies among the measurements, IEDs, and RTUs, we considered arbitrary SCADA systems as described in Section V-A. The results are shown in Figure 7(a). We find that an SCADA system can tolerate a larger number of IED failures than RTU failures. This is because RTUs are often responsible for multiple IEDs, and one RTU failure can have a larger impact compared to IED failures.

#### Resiliency Threat Space Analysis

In Figure 7(b), we show the threat space varying the hierarchy level for the 14-bus system. We observe that the higher the hierarchy level, the larger the threat space (i.e., the number of potential threat vectors). The increase in hierarchy creates more dependencies among RTUs and IEDs due to increased connectivity among RTUs. As a result, there is more scope for contingencies that can violate the resiliency specifications, leading to an increase in the threat space. Moreover, if we increase the resiliency specifications, the threat space becomes larger.

### VI. Related Work

The security policy misconfiguration and its verification have been extensively studied for over a decade [11], [12], [13], [14]. These approaches propose formal definitions of configuration anomalies and safe deployment of single or multiple security devices, and present algorithms to discover configuration inconsistencies. There are also several works on risk-based security configuration analysis. Risk analysis and security hardening using attack graphs have been proposed by several researchers [15], [16], [17]. However, these tools are designed for traditional networks and cannot be applied to smart grids, which require considering different cyber-physical operations and security controls.

A number of studies [4], [18], [19], [20] have focused on describing security and resiliency issues based on different attack scenarios. These works also describe the functional operations of smart grid components and provide guidelines for reliable and robust communication among them. They advise that energy providers or utilities should not be trusted without proper verification of implemented security measures. McLaughlin et al. [21] analyze security and privacy challenges in smart grid networks and present an approach for penetration testing on Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) systems [22]. They develop archetypal and concrete attack trees for energy fraud, denial of service, and targeted disconnect attacks. Rahman et al. [23] develop a formal model-based tool for end-to-end security verification of AMI in smart grids. However, these works do not analyze various misconfiguration problems and security controls in smart electric grid networks.

Wang et al. [24] present an artificial intelligence-based approach for analyzing risks in smart grid networks but do not consider network node, link, or communication failures and their effects on control procedures. Anwar et al. [25], [26] propose frameworks for modeling power grids and their control elements using first-order logic. These frameworks are only capable of evaluating power flows and overloading violations in smart grids. Several research works [6], [27] study false data injection attacks in power grids, discussing the undetectability properties of these attacks, which adversaries can use to bypass existing bad data detection algorithms. They consider different scenarios, such as limited access to meters, limited resources to compromise meters, and arbitrary or specific targets, assuming the adversary has complete or incomplete information about the grid. Rahman et al. [10], [28] present verification models for various Unobservable False Data Injection (UFDI) attacks with respect to attacker constraints and impact objectives. Yuan et al. [29] propose a variant of this kind of attack known as a load redistribution attack.

Although the above-mentioned research shows how stealthy attacks can be launched against control processes like state estimation, they do not model data deliveries, secured communications, or resiliency properties of the system under cyber-attacks or accidental failures. Therefore, there is still a need for modeling SCADA configurations and analyzing the security and resiliency properties. In this work, we address this need by developing a formal model for provably analyzing operational consistency, security, and resiliency in SCADA systems.

### VII. Conclusion

A smart grid contains a large number of cyber and physical devices, as well as various critical control mechanisms, leading to increased potential for security and resiliency vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present an automated formal framework for verifying SCADA resiliency, focusing on security configurations, controls, and resiliency requirements. We create a logic-based verification model and use SMT to solve it as a constraint satisfaction problem. Our proposed framework performs static configuration analysis to determine potential threats as violations to the smart grid security and resiliency requirements. We demonstrate the framework using a test configuration and show its efficacy. The scalability evaluation of the framework shows that the execution time is within 30 seconds for a SCADA system with 400 physical devices (IEDs and RTUs). In future work, we plan to consider the automated synthesis of necessary configurations for resilient SCADA systems satisfying the security and resiliency requirements.
