**Existing Attestation Schemes:**
Current attestation schemes typically focus on a single prover and verifier, which limits their effectiveness in efficiently verifying a large number of devices. To our knowledge, there is only one proposal that aims to attest multiple provers running the same software simultaneously [41]. This approach involves the verifier comparing integrity measurements from multiple provers rather than individually verifying each attestation report. In contrast, our proposed attestation scheme supports a large number of provers, whether they are running the same or different software, and distributes the verification of attestation reports across the entire swarm.

**Secure Boot:**
Secure boot ensures that a device's configuration is verified by the device itself, rather than by an external entity [2]. This process guarantees that only known and trustworthy software can be loaded onto the device. However, secure boot is limited to verifying software integrity at load-time. Attestation, on the other hand, enables the verification of system integrity at any point in time.

**Secure Data Aggregation:**
Secure data aggregation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) aims to reduce communication overhead by combining data from individual sensor nodes while preserving the authenticity of this data. Various approaches have been proposed, including those based on cryptographic techniques [8, 9, 28, 32, 40, 54], trust relations [39], and witness-based solutions [15]. These methods often require the entire swarm to share global keys [32] or involve computationally expensive asymmetric cryptography [28]. Additionally, most proposed aggregation techniques have high computational and communication complexities [10, 15, 37]. SEDA overcomes these limitations by aggregating attestation results in a manner similar to [31, 55], leveraging minimal hardware security features.

**Random Sampling:**
Similar to the statistical sampling approach discussed in Section 8, Secure Implicit Sampling [34] aims to detect whether some nodes in a sensor network failed to receive a broadcast message. The method involves a randomly chosen subset of nodes replying to the broadcast with authenticated acknowledgments. The security of this scheme is based on the infeasibility of an adversary (ADV) correctly predicting the randomly sampled subset.

**Sensor Networks:**
There is extensive literature on sensor and ad-hoc networks, covering topics such as secure key management [18, 53], secure routing [20, 57], and secure broadcasting [1, 49]. However, we are not aware of any work that specifically addresses the integrity verification of a large number of devices in this area.

### Conclusions
We introduced SEDA, the first efficient attestation protocol designed for device swarms, which are systems consisting of a large number of heterogeneous devices with dynamic topologies. We developed a security model for swarm attestation and demonstrated the security of SEDA against software-only attacks within this model. We also discussed potential directions for mitigating physical attacks on devices. The feasibility of SEDA was demonstrated on low-end embedded platforms through two concrete implementations based on recently proposed security architectures for embedded devices: SMART [16] and TrustLite [25]. Evaluation results show that SEDA is efficient for swarms of up to 1,000,000 devices. Key advantages of SEDA include:
1. Reduced overall protocol runtime.
2. Constant verifier overhead.
3. Lower and evenly distributed overhead.
Furthermore, the verifier does not need prior knowledge about the devices or their configurations.

**Future Work:**
Future research will focus on optimizing SEDA for highly dynamic swarms and minimizing required device assumptions by reducing the amount of code and data that need to be protected in hardware. Additionally, we plan to investigate scenarios where a subset of devices lack hardware security features and can only be attested via software-based techniques. Another future direction is to develop a swarm attestation mechanism capable of detecting code-reuse attacks.
