## Abstract

Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) have become a fundamental component of inter-domain routing over the past decade. Today, they offer their members access to hundreds, if not thousands, of potential peering networks. This paper explores the extent to which peering at large IXPs can provide reachability to prefixes and services. We analyze and compare Route Server snapshots from eight of the world's largest IXPs and conduct an in-depth analysis of bilateral and private peering at a single IXP using its peering LAN traffic and queries to carefully selected, nearby looking glasses. To evaluate the significance of the prefixes available via each peering type, we use two orthogonal metrics: the number of domains served by the prefix and the traffic volume that a large eyeball network egresses towards it.

Our results show that multilateral peering can cover approximately 20% of the routed IPv4 and 40% of the routed IPv6 address space. Many of these routes lead to out-of-continent locations reachable only via three or more AS hops, yet most IXP members primarily use "local" (i.e., single-hop) routes. Bilateral peering enables IXP members to reach more than half of all routed IPv4 and more than one-third of all routed IPv6 address space. These routes include almost all of the top 10,000 egress prefixes of our eyeball network, satisfying the reachability requirements of most end users. However, they miss up to 20% of the top 10,000 prefixes that serve the most domains, often belonging to large transit and Tier 1 providers.

## 1. Introduction

The Internet traditionally follows a hierarchical structure, with large transit providers (Tier 1 networks) at the top, exchanging traffic with each other without monetary compensation. This type of interconnection is commonly referred to as "peering."

IXPs allow physically close networks to exchange traffic via a shared layer-2 switching fabric, reducing unnecessary routing detours and overall latency. The largest IXPs now have hundreds to thousands of members (see Figure 1) and handle peak traffic volumes exceeding 10 Tb/s [4, 27, 38].

Different forms of peering have emerged due to varying negotiation positions. Bilateral peering involves a direct connection between two ASes via the IXP's switching fabric. Lower-tier networks have increasingly shifted transit traffic to new peering connections since the early 2000s, driven by cost reduction and potential latency improvements [2]. The rapid deployment of IXPs has further accelerated this trend.

To simplify operations, most IXPs offer Route Servers that redistribute routes received from one IXP member to all others via a single BGP session per member. This form of peering, involving more than two networks, is known as multilateral peering. Alternatively, networks can establish private peering sessions via dedicated cross-connects in the same colocation facility or through layer-2 transport for different facilities.

While peering is well-established, there is a lack of comprehensive insights into the routes available at large IXPs. This paper examines how different forms of peering translate into transit-free prefix reachability, characterizing and comparing multilateral peering routes at the Route Servers of the world's largest IXPs and estimating bilateral and private peering routes at one large European IXP (referred to as L-IXP). We assess the importance of these routes using two dimensions: the number of top domains served and the traffic volume egressed by a large European eyeball network.

**Contributions:**

- **Characterization of Multilateral Peering:** We analyze and compare Route Server snapshots from eight of the ten largest IXP peering LANs worldwide (Section 4). Key findings include: (1) only 10% of Route Server peers provide more than 100 routes, while 30% provide fewer than ten; (2) about half of the Route Server routes have a minimum path length of three ASes, and two-thirds lead to out-of-continent destinations; and (3) most large Route Servers have a prefix overlap of approximately 50%, with a 60-70% overlap in reachable IPs.
  
- **Characterization of Bilateral & Private Peering:** For one of Europe's largest IXPs, we infer routes available via bilateral and private peering (Section 5.1). We observe that many ASes use the switching fabric for additional transit sessions, which can influence our inferences. We developed a methodology to increase the coverage of relationship inference algorithms at IXPs and used the resulting relationships to isolate transit connections during the inference process. We also introduce a methodology to infer routes available via private peering based on the careful selection and querying of looking glass utilities.

- **Route Importance:** We compare the IPv4 and IPv6 routes available via multilateral, bilateral, and private peering against two top-10K prefix lists: one based on the number of served domains and one based on the traffic volume of a large European eyeball network (Section 6). We find that nearly all top-10k IPv4 prefixes are available via bilateral peering. For IPv6, we observe that prefixes serving many domains are often unavailable (up to 15%) or can only be obtained via private peering.

## 2. Background

### Interconnection Models

Interconnection agreements can be complex in practice, but the scientific literature generally categorizes them into two types: transit and peering.

- **Transit Agreement:** A customer pays a transit provider to deliver its traffic from its egress router to any IP.
- **Peering Agreement:** Two ASes, usually of similar size and with roughly equal traffic volume, forward each other's traffic without substantial financial exchange. They must negotiate the physical interconnection and infrastructure costs.

### Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)

IXPs provide a shared switching infrastructure to reduce the need for individual BGP peering sessions. These points are located in well-connected colocation facilities, which provide dedicated infrastructure for housing peering equipment. Previous work has shown that some large IXPs can theoretically reach 70% of all routed addresses [10], and remote peering is common, with up to 40% of members connecting via remote-peering at certain large IXPs [57].

### Types of Peering

- **Bilateral Peering:** A BGP peering session between two member ASes via the shared peering fabric. While legal processes and concerns of peering policy leakage can slow down the acquisition of partners, recent frameworks have been proposed to expedite this process [50].
  
- **Multilateral Peering:** IXPs provide Route Servers to facilitate multilateral peerings, reducing the number of BGP sessions needed for a fully-meshed topology. Some IXP members avoid Route Servers due to concerns about exposing their peering policies [23].

- **Private Peering:** Networks can establish private peering sessions via direct cross-connects, avoiding the IXP's peering fabric. This practice is preferred by large ASes for fine-grained control over their peering sessions.

This paper provides a detailed analysis of the reachability benefits and limitations of different peering types at large IXPs, offering valuable insights for network operators and researchers.
