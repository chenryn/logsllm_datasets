# Let’s Get Physical: Network Attacks Against Physical Security Systems
## Ricky “HeadlessZeke” Lawshae – Defcon24 – 2016

### Introduction
**About the Speaker:**
- **Security Researcher at TippingPoint**
- **IoT (drink!) Hacking Enthusiast**
- **Occasional Conference Presenter**
- **Former Installer of Physical Security Systems**

### Physical Security Overview
**Physical Security Devices:**
- **Access Control:** Card readers, door controls, biometric scanners, PIN pads.
- **Surveillance:** Video cameras, DVRs, motion sensors.
- **Alarms:** Fire alarms, tamper switches, smoke detectors.

### Deployment
**Deployment in Organizations:**
- **Ubiquitous Use:** Deployed by organizations of all sizes.
- **Network Integration:** Components are increasingly connected to the network for:
  - Alarm acknowledgment and camera monitoring.
  - Schedule and access changes.
  - Log and report retrieval.
- **Digital Transformation:** Physical security is becoming part of the Internet of Things (IoT).

### Embedded Devices
**Embedded Devices:**
- **Accessible via the Network:**
  - Protect valuable assets.
  - Present in every organization.
  - Should be secure, but often are not.

### Access Control
**Overview:**
- **Locking Mechanism:**
  - ID reader (magstripe, RFID, biometric, PIN pad).
  - Request to Exit (REX) signal.
  - Door contact (magnet or switch).
  - Lock or strike.
  - Door controller (contains schedules and access rules).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **ID Reader:**
  - RFID spoofing, brute force, biometric forgery.
- **REX:**
  - Trigger PIR sensor, pull inside handle.
- **Management Software:**
  - Vulnerable host, unsecured database.
- **Door Controller:**
  - Network-connected embedded device with complete control over door functionality.

**Door Controller Attacks:**
- **API Exposure:**
  - Forge or replay remote unlock commands.
  - Lack of encryption and authentication.
  - Example: PSIA standard used by manufacturers, allowing HTTP PUT requests to `accessOverride` URI.
- **Vulnerabilities in Running Services:**
  - Onboard management portal.
  - Default credentials or authentication bypass.
  - Command injection.
  - Old, unpatched services.
  - Proprietary services (good targets for fuzzing).

### Surveillance
**Overview:**
- **Video Camera:**
  - Hard-wired or IP-based.
- **DVR:**
  - Management and viewing software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Management/Viewing Software:**
  - Similar vulnerabilities as other software.
- **DVR:**
  - Modify or delete recordings, DoS to prevent recording.
- **Video Camera:**
  - Disable or DoS camera.
  - Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) video stream.

**MitM Video Stream:**
- **Protocols:**
  - RTP or MJPG, usually UDP with no encryption.
- **Techniques:**
  - Intercept, modify, and resend frames.
  - Loop playback by capturing and reinjecting frames with modified timestamps.
  - Replace stream with static or a single image.
  - Use OpenCV to find and replace faces.

### Alarms
**Overview:**
- **Fire Alarms:**
  - Smoke/fire detectors.
  - Alarm panel.
  - Suppression system.
- **Tamper Sensors:**
  - Simple switches and resistance measurement.
- **Motion Sensors:**
  - PIR and microwave (MW) sensors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Fire Alarms:**
  - Use vulnerable panel as a pivot point.
  - Cause false positives as a distraction.
- **Motion Sensors:**
  - DoS the sensor to prevent reporting.
  - Spoof any heartbeats.

### The Heist
**Components Involved:**
- Video camera
- Motion sensor
- Reader
- Door controller
- Target: Hope diamond, CEO’s credit card info

### Defense Strategies
**Network Segmentation:**
- VLANs and firewalls.
- Monitor networks for anomalous activity.
- Regular firmware updates.
- Clearly define ownership and responsibilities.
- Manufacturers need to be more open about security.

**Offense Strategies:**
- **Audit Before Deployment:**
  - Hack your own devices.
  - Use 3rd party resellers for devices and firmware.
- **Think Before You Link:**
  - Consider the necessity of each IoT device.
  - Think like an attacker to anticipate and mitigate risks.
