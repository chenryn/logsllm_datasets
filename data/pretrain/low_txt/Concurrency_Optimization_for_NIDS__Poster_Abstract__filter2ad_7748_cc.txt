### P-601: Metabolomics with Matrigel-based 3D Cell Culture: Analytical Challenges
**Presenting Author:**

**Co-Authors:**
- Gabriele Möller, Cornelia Prehn, Jerzy Adamski

**Abstract:**
Cell culture metabolomics is a versatile tool for understanding metabolic processes. Two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures are widely used due to their ease of manipulation but have limitations, such as non-physiological environments and loss of key functionalities like xenobiotic metabolism. Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures, supported by extracellular matrices like Matrigel, can overcome these limitations. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of combining Matrigel-based 3D cell culture with targeted metabolomics.

Hep G2 cells were seeded into Matrigel at varying densities. After solidification, the Matrigel-cell complexes were covered with culture medium and harvested by scraping in ice-cold 80% methanol. The samples were then disrupted using bead-based homogenization, centrifuged, and analyzed using the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQTM p180 Kit. Parallel analyses were conducted on 2D cultured cells and plain Matrigel samples.

Significant ion suppression was observed in Matrigel samples. Some metabolites, particularly lipids, showed higher concentrations in cell samples compared to Matrigel. Conversely, many amino acids and hexoses were more concentrated in Matrigel samples without cells, indicating diffusion from the culture medium into the matrix. Our data demonstrate that targeted metabolomics with Matrigel-supported 3D cell cultures is feasible, but the extracellular matrix causes significant contamination, posing a challenge for metabolomics experiments.

**Abstract:**
Molecular networking has become an essential bioinformatic tool for annotating non-targeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data. Available on the GNPS web-platform (http://gnps.ucsd.edu), molecular networking accelerates the annotation of molecular/spectral families by propagating spectral library matches across networks. However, MS-Cluster, which uses MS/MS spectral counts as a proxy for ion distribution, may not accurately estimate relative ion abundance, especially in single studies.

We introduce feature-based molecular networking (FBMN), a collection of computational tools integrated into a seamless LC-MS data processing pipeline on the GNPS web-platform (https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/featurebasedmolecularnetworking/). FBMN utilizes software with advanced graphical user interfaces (MS-DIAL, MZmine2, MetaboScape) and advanced computational libraries (OpenMS, XC-MS), serving both experimentalists, bioinformaticians, and software developers.

We benchmarked FBMN on dilutions of NIST serum samples, showing improved estimation of ion relative distribution and reduced spectral artifacts. These results were consistent across different instruments and sample types, indicating that FBMN offers significant advantages over MS-Cluster-based molecular networking. FBMN is proposed as a complementary tool to the robust, nearly parameterless MS-Cluster method, which is the only method capable of large-scale meta-analysis of non-targeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics datasets.

### P-603: A Comparison of Untargeted Metabolomic Methods Using 2.1 and 1.0 mm ID UHPLC Columns
**Presenting Author:**
- Annie Harwood-Stamper, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom

**Co-Authors:**
- Lukàš Najdekr, Mark R. Viant, Caroline A. Rowland, Warwick B. Dunn

**Abstract:**
Untargeted ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) metabolomics is widely used for various sample types. Standard methods employ columns with 2.1 mm internal diameters (ID) when sufficient sample volume is available. However, if sample volumes are limited (<10 µL), more sensitive analytical methods are required. Previous research has shown that smaller ID columns can increase sensitivity for some sample types, but complete characterization is lacking.

This study aimed to determine the influence of column ID on sensitivity and sample volume requirements by comparing 2.1 mm and 1.0 mm ID columns. Human plasma and urine were prepared in serial dilutions and analyzed using UHPLC columns with the same stationary phase composition and particle size. Three analytical assays were used: lipophilic reversed phase C18, aqueous end-capped reversed phase C18 for semi-polar metabolites, and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) for polar metabolites.

Results show that, following optimization, the 1.0 mm ID methods are more sensitive than the 2.1 mm ID methods for the same sample volume and are suitable for untargeted mammalian tear analysis.

### P-604: A Simple Strategy to Improve Data Quality in LC-MS-Based Metabolomics Studies of Human Urine
**Presenting Author:**

**Co-Authors:**
- Rosilene Cristina Rossetto Burgos, Pedro Luis Rocha da Cruz, Helio Tedesco-Silva Junior, Karina Helena Morais Cardozo, Valdemir Melechco Carvalho, Marina Franco Maggi Tavares

**Abstract:**
A significant challenge in LC-MS-based metabolomics is signal intensity variation due to the accumulation of sample components in the column and front parts of the MS system. We propose simple changes to improve data quality, tested on 176 urine samples from renal transplant patients. These changes include using a divert valve to direct the column effluent to waste during the initial and final stages of the chromatographic separation, combined with a longer column cleanup between injections.

The method was tested before and after introducing these modifications using an UPLC (Waters) and QExactive (Thermo), along with Skyline for data monitoring. Quality controls (QCs) showed significant improvements in peak area repeatability, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of selected metabolites decreasing from ~60% to ~10%. Similarly, RSDs of peak areas for internal standards spiked into individual urine samples improved from ~40% to ~10%. Calibrant solutions injected at the beginning and end of the sequence had more comparable signals after the modifications.

We recommend the use of a divert valve and extended column cleanup as simple modifications to improve data quality in metabolomics studies.

### P-605: High-Throughput Targeted Lipidomics Analysis of Dihydroceramide Desaturase-1 (DES1) Knockout Mice
**Presenting Author:**
- Mackenzie Pearson, SCIEX, United States

**Co-Authors:**
- Santosh Kapil Kumar Gorti, Trevor S. Tippetts, Scott A. Summers

**Abstract:**
Amide column chemistry was chosen for lipid class separation and to minimize isomeric interference. The target list of lipids is comprehensive, covering most major lipid classes and categories, with multiple reaction monitoring (MRMs) selected to cover lipids containing fatty acids with 14 to 22 carbons and 0 to 6 double bonds. The method is customizable, allowing new lipid categories, classes, and molecular species to be added to the MRMs list. This method provides quantitative measurement of over 1,150 different lipid molecular species in a rapid, highly reproducible manner.

The sMRM Pro Builder template streamlines the method optimization process, enabling the assignment of retention times, dwell weight optimization, and window size per MRM to enhance coverage and sensitivity. This optimization improved results, especially for low-abundant lipids. Liver and eWAT tissues were harvested from dihydroceramide desaturase-1 (DES1) knockout mice. DES1 is responsible for inserting the 4,5-trans-double bond into the sphingolipid backbone, converting dihydroceramide to ceramide. While both lipid classes are lower in abundance in the chosen tissues, this method shows significant changes in these lipid classes quantitatively. Lipid standards from 19 different classes served as internal standards, providing extensive lipid class coverage.

### P-606: A Novel Approach for Untargeted Plant Secondary Metabolic Profiling and Its Application to Studying Resistance-Related Metabolites in Maize
**Presenting Author:**

**Co-Authors:**

**Abstract:**
Secondary metabolites are the end products of complex metabolic pathways in plants, playing crucial roles in growth, development, and defense. Comprehensive identification of secondary metabolites is challenging due to their chemical diversity and tissue-specific and time-dependent accumulations. We developed a novel metabolic profiling method based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography−high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) to investigate secondary metabolites in maize.

A high-coverage MS/MS acquisition method was developed using segmented scans, and a multi-informational molecular network was constructed for comprehensive identification. The secondary metabolite composition of maize leaves, silk, and seeds was investigated. Tissue-specific accumulation of secondary metabolites was observed. Herbivore-induced alterations in secondary metabolites of maize silk were studied, revealing significant variations. Insect-resistant metabolites, such as benzoxazinones, terpenes, and hydroxycinnamic acid amides, were significantly accumulated, while flavonoids and flavonoid phytoalexins were decreased. These results demonstrate the utility of the untargeted metabolic profiling method for insights into secondary metabolite defense in crops.

### P-607: Deeper Level of Comprehensive Metabolite Quantitation with Data Independent Acquisition
**Presenting Author:**
- Baljit Ubhi, SCIEX, United States

**Co-Authors:**
- Zuzana Demianova

**Abstract:**
The major challenge in metabolomics is accurately identifying and quantifying hundreds of metabolites in a single run. Variable window SWATH acquisition has shown to identify a higher number of metabolites compared to traditional Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA), enabling broader metabolome coverage. We implemented a variable window SWATH acquisition method for enhanced quantitation of selected metabolites using MS/MS, with reduced matrix interferences and improved signal-to-noise ratios.

Using MS/MS fragments for metabolite quantitation provides better selectivity and sensitivity. Variable window SWATH acquisition provided quality quantitative data for metabolites in complex matrices. Complete full scan MS and MS/MS data are available in every SWATH file for improved identification. MS/MS quantitation often leads to lower detection limits due to improved signal-to-noise ratios. SCIEX OS software combines comprehensive qualitative and quantitative data analysis, making data processing easier and more efficient. SWATH acquisition on all detectable metabolites is successfully utilized for identification and accurate MS/MS level quantification of metabolites in urine.

### P-608: Automated High-Throughput Flux Analysis of Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma Cells Grown in vitro in Two and Three Dimensions
**Presenting Author:**

**Co-Authors:**

**Abstract:**
Cell lines are widely used to study disease and treatment. Monolayer (2D) cell cultures are commonly used, but they may not accurately recreate the in vivo environment. Spheroid (3D) cell cultures are considered more viable alternatives. H1299 cells were grown as 2D monolayers in Eagle’s media and as 3D spheroids in 2% pHEMA dissolved in ethanol. Following sample preparation, the samples were injected onto an LC-oaToF-MS system. The LC-MS fluxomics data were processed with an informatics pipeline for data transfer, conversion, peak detection, curation, natural abundance correction, and visualization.

Analysis of human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells indicated that the lactate fractional enrichment of the 13C3 isotopologue is significantly higher in spheroid versus monolayer cell cultures. Since 13C3-lactate is the major isotopologue produced from 13C6-glucose, the observations suggest that glycolysis is upregulated in spheroid cell cultures. Key intermediates in the TCA cycle had higher 13C2 isotopologues, suggesting a higher contribution of glucose to the TCA cycle via acetyl CoA in spheroid cell cultures.

### P-609: Meta-Analysis of Tracer-Biotransformation Experiments of Exogenic and Endogenic Isotopically-Labeled Tracer Compounds with LC-HRMS and MetExtract II
**Presenting Author:**
- Christoph Bueschl, IFA-Tulln, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences BOKU, Vienna, Austria

**Co-Authors:**
- Bernhard Kluger, Maria Doppler, Jacqueline Meng-Reiterer, Asja Ceranic, Rainer Schuhmacher, Rudof Krska

**Abstract:**
Tracer-based metabolomics studies have become more popular with the increased availability of isotopically-labeled tracers. By spiking a biological organism (e.g., plants, fungi, mammals) with these labeled tracers, virtually all biotransformation products can be detected under the tested experimental conditions. The TracExtract workflow combines LC-HRMS with the custom-tailored software MetExtract-II for the fully automated and untargeted detection of novel biotransformation products.

This work summarizes the results of several studies using mainly 13C-labeled tracers (e.g., mycotoxins, tryptophan, phenylalanine, methylation artifacts, and glucose). For example, 172 biotransformation products of phenylalanine in wheat plants infected with Fusarium graminearum, more than 50 novel detoxification products of mycotoxins in different cereal plants, and 88 sampling artifacts of methanol were successfully detected. The number of identified metabolites varied depending on the studied tracers. The automated, untargeted search for novel biotransformation products was very specific, resulting in few false-positives. The results demonstrate that isotopically-labeled tracers and the developed workflow are generic, highly specific, and can be applied to virtually any isotopically-labeled tracer without complicated experimental setups.

### P-610: Comparison of Methanol, Acetonitrile, and Ethanol with Respect to Solvent-Induced Artifact Formation in Biological Samples
**Presenting Author:**
- Bernhard Seidl, IFA-Tulln, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU), Austria

**Co-Authors:**
- Christoph Bueschl, Michael Sulyok, Rainer Schuhmacher

**Abstract:**
Organic solvents play a critical role in metabolomics experiments, ideally behaving inertly and not altering the metabolites. It has been shown that methanol extraction of plant material results in the formation of numerous solvent-induced artifacts. We investigated and compared artifact formation by acetonitrile, ethanol, and methanol. The filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei was cultivated in synthetic minimal liquid medium, and both the culture media supernatant and the fungal mycelium were extracted separately with each of the three solvents. Native and deuterated forms of the solvents were used, and the experiment was also performed on fully labeled 13C samples to classify metabolites of biological origin.

LC-HRMS data were searched for coeluting feature pairs with identical peak shapes and m/z values differing by exactly a multiple of the mass increment between 1H and 2H. Numerous artifacts induced by methanol were found, while ethanol- and acetonitrile-derived extracts also contained solvent-induced artifacts, albeit to a much lesser extent.

### P-611: Investigating Metabolic Flux in Central Metabolic Pathways Associated with Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 Mutations Using [1,2-13C2]Glucose
**Presenting Author:**
- Areesha Nazeer, University of Oxford, UK, United Kingdom

**Co-Authors:**
- John Walsby-Tickle, Edward Smith, David Hauton, James S.O. McCullagh

**Abstract:**
Isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations are found in various cancers, including glioma and acute myeloid leukemia, leading to the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). The mechanism of tumorigenesis is still not fully understood. [1,2-13C2] glucose was used as a tracer to quantify metabolic flux in LN18 IDH mutant (IDH1) and IDH wild type cells. Anion-chromatography coupled to a Q-exactive orbitrap MS system was used to measure glycolytic, pentose phosphate pathway, and TCA cycle metabolites and concomitant isotopomer distributions.

INCA was used to calculate flux values by minimizing the difference between measured labeling patterns and those simulated by the metabolic model with 95% confidence intervals. LN18 mutant cells showed altered flux through central metabolic pathways, with a high flux from α-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxglutrate and a decreased flux from α-ketoglutarate to succinate, fumarate, and malate. This indicates decreased oxidation of glucose in the TCA cycle compared to LN18 wild type cells. A decreased flux through PDH and an increased flux from pyruvate to lactate through LDH suggested broader metabolic reprogramming in IDH1 mutant cells. These metabolic alterations may help identify potential new therapeutic targets.

### P-612: Tracer-Based Metabolomics for Immune Cells: Exploring Central Carbon Metabolism in Human Natural Killer Cells
**Presenting Author:**

**Co-Authors:**
- Liesbeth Vereyken, Ian Strickland, Rob J. Vreeken

**Abstract:**
While immunotherapy is emerging as a successful alternative to classical drug therapy for diseases such as cancer and chronic infectious diseases, little is known about the fine-tuning between metabolism and functions of immune cells. Central carbon metabolism, providing energy, cellular building blocks, and precursors for cell signaling and epigenetic factors, is of key interest. To quantify central carbon metabolites and determine the relative contribution of specific metabolic pathways, we established a tracer-based metabolomic platform using stable isotopes and metabolic network modeling.

Human lymphoma NK-92 and leukemia KHYG-1 natural killer cells were fed with 13C6-glucose for 24 hours to reach isotopic steady state prior to metabolite extraction. A general analytical method for small molecules, amino acids, and organic acids was developed using an UPLC HILIC column system and a Q-Exactive HF orbitrap mass spectrometer. First experiments demonstrated incorporation of the 13C isotope label into downstream metabolites of glucose. This platform will be further validated by dissecting the various metabolic modes associated with different activation or inhibitory stimuli on NK cells in vitro and on (pre-)clinical samples of chronic infectious diseases (e.g., Hepatitis B, HIV).

### P-613: Glutamine and Nitrogen Metabolism in Cancer
**Presenting Author:**

**Co-Authors:**
- Safak Bayram, Guido Mastrobuoni, Christin Zasada, Stefan Kempa

**Abstract:**
Metabolic reprogramming is a required step during oncogenesis, triggered by the activation of oncogenes and loss of tumor suppressors. This leads to the activation of central metabolic pathways to support cell growth and proliferation. Glycolysis and nitrogen metabolism are enhanced to support the de novo biosynthesis of nucleotides, with nitrogen sourced from amino acids like glutamine or alanine or from free ammonium.

To quantify the usage and activity of metabolic pathways in vitro and in vivo, we developed pulsed stable isotope resolved metabolomics (pSIRM). This GC-MS-based technology enables the absolute quantification of metabolites and the determination of stable isotope incorporation. We are developing new methods using ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry to quantify the dynamics of nitrogen and carbon metabolism simultaneously. These new technologies aim to better characterize the metabolic mode of cancer cells and identify suitable therapeutic targets.
