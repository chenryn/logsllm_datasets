When attempting to delete files via the right-click menu in the sidebar, the deletion process does not complete successfully. After selecting "Delete" from the menu, a dialog box appears, asking if I want to move the file or directory to the trash. When I click "Move to Trash," no action is taken. The file remains visible in the sidebar and still exists on my filesystem.

I am using Linux (Debian) x64 with Atom version 0.126, but I experienced the same issue with versions 0.124 and 0.123.
