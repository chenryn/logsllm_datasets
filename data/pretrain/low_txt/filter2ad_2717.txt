**Abstract:**
Throughout the history of computer and network security research, privacy has often been equated with confidentiality, with the ultimate goal being mathematically provable anonymity. Despite significant advancements in cryptography and network security, which have enabled robust confidentiality controls over identity exposure in information systems, the majority of internet users remain deeply concerned about their privacy rights. They rightly believe that they are more exposed today than they were a generation ago. 

This raises the question: Have we failed to deploy the right security technology, do our laws fall short of addressing current privacy threats, or have business practices and social norms rendered privacy obsolete? While each of these factors plays a role, the primary failure in achieving robust privacy in the information age can be attributed to the long-standing conflation of privacy with confidentiality and access control.

To revitalize privacy protection, we need to shift our legal focus from rules limiting the disclosure of personal information to policies governing how personal information can be used. Technical efforts currently centered on access control and anonymization should be redirected towards measures that enhance transparency and accountability, ensuring that the use of personal information adheres to clearly stated policies that distinguish between proper and improper uses.
