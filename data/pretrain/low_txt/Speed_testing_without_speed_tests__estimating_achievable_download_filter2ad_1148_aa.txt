### Abstract
The speed at which real users can download content at different locations and times is a critical metric for service providers. This information helps in capacity planning and detecting network issues. However, current methods often rely on active "speed tests" that place a significant load on the network and may not accurately represent user experiences, especially in wireless networks where physical location impacts performance. This paper introduces a new technique to estimate achievable download speeds using only passively collected flow records. The method addresses the challenge of estimating steady-state TCP throughput by constructing a Throughput Index, which identifies flow types that accurately reflect achievable speeds. We demonstrate that our technique provides more accurate estimates than existing methods in a large 3G wireless network.

### Introduction
Achieving a high and stable throughput for TCP flows at any given time and location in a network, referred to as max-throughput, is a crucial metric for service providers. It helps in determining where additional capacity is needed and in identifying temporary network issues. The increasing popularity of multimedia downloads and streaming further emphasizes the importance of measuring max-throughput. However, the shift from wired to wireless access makes this estimation more challenging with traditional active measurements. This paper presents a novel technique to estimate max-throughput passively, demonstrating its accuracy in a large 3G wireless network.

Several active probing techniques exist to estimate available capacity, but they are often insufficient for estimating max-throughput, particularly in wireless networks where packet delays can be caused by factors other than congestion. The state-of-the-art approach involves periodically downloading large files from active probes, but this method has limitations: it adds extra load to the network, is costly to deploy and maintain, and does not capture the experience of real users at different vantage points.

This paper explores whether passive measurements of real flows within a network can provide sufficient data to estimate max-throughput. While passive measurements have been used for various network metrics, estimating max-throughput poses unique challenges. These include the inability to control the duration of TCP flows, the potential for throttling by content providers, and the impracticality of recording and analyzing every packet in a large network.

### Background
To evaluate our passive max-throughput estimation, we analyzed traffic traces from a large UMTS wireless network. The majority of our analysis uses traces collected from April 1-7, 2010, from an infrastructure that monitored all traffic on the Gn interface between Serving GPRS Support Nodes (SGSNs) and Gateway GPRS Support Nodes (GGSNs). The traces cover data traffic from all regions of the UMTS network within the Pacific and Central time zones, without personally identifiable information.

**Flow Records:**
- One flow record was collected every minute for a random 3% of users.
- Flows are distinguished by the (ipsrc, ipdst, sport, dport) tuple.
- Each record includes:
  - **Application:** The application protocol used.
  - **Content-Provider:** The service the flow is communicating with.
  - **Bytes:** Volume transferred during the 1-minute interval.
  - **Duration:** Time between the first and last packets.
  - **Total Bytes:** Volume transferred since the start of the flow.

**Device Categories:**
- Different handset types have varying maximum air interface speeds.
- This study focuses on downlink 3G flows from HSDPA category 6 devices, capable of 3.6 Mbps.
- Device type is identified by the Type Allocation Code in the GTP tunnel.

**Throughput Normalization:**
- All throughput values are normalized by an arbitrary constant for proprietary reasons.

### Methodology
Our goal is to estimate the average max-throughput over a given time interval for downloading from an unconstrained Internet source using passively collected TCP flow records. A simple approach would be to average the byte/duration values, but this does not account for factors like total flow size, application protocol, and content-provider. Our technique filters flow records to discard these effects.

**Why Not Measure All Large Flows?**
- TCP flows begin in a slow-start phase, gradually probing for available capacity.
- To measure max-throughput, we need to consider flows that have exited the slow-start phase.
- The volume transferred during slow-start depends on RTT and bottleneck capacity, which vary by flow.

### Contributions
- Our approach does not require packet traces and needs minimal online processing, making it scalable for large-scale monitoring.
- We validate our technique in a large 3G wireless network, finding a correlation coefficient of 0.88 with active probe measurements.
- We classify rate-limited content-providers and applications, revealing that nearly 60% of large flows are rate-limited and cannot reach peak network capacity.

### Conclusion
This paper introduces a new, passive technique for estimating achievable download speeds in a 3G wireless network. By constructing a Throughput Index, we identify flow types that accurately reflect max-throughput. Our method is validated in a large 3G network, showing higher accuracy compared to existing techniques. This approach is scalable and practical for real-world deployment, providing valuable insights for network management and optimization.
