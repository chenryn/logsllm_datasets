### Introduction to Exfiltration
**Definition:**
"Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of sensitive information from a targetâ€™s network to a location controlled by a threat actor." - Trend Micro

**Why Should You Care?**
- Data loss can be costly in terms of time, money, and mental well-being.
- Ever come across a credential dump on Pastebin?
- If you are reading this, you already care about security.
- 82% of respondents in a 2012 /r/netsec survey indicated that preventing data exfiltration is crucial for the security of their information systems.

### Esoteric Exfiltration Techniques
#### Masking Traffic with Normal Usage Patterns

#### Hiding Data in Known "Safe" Payloads
- **Status Updates:** Embed data in social media posts.
- **HTTP POST Payloads:** Conceal data within form submissions.

#### Staying Quiet and Within Normal Payload Sizes
- **Throttle Exfiltration Chunks:** Control the rate of data transfer.
- **Set Payload Sizes Based on Channel:** Adjust data size to match the communication channel.
- **Encode and/or Encrypt Chunks:** Protect data from detection and interception.

### Covert Channels and Their Locations
