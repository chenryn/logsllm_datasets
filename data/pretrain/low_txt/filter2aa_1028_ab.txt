### Overview of the Cyber Defense Exercise (CDX)

#### Admin/Root, SCADA PLC
- **Green Team**: Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI), Linköping, Sweden
  - Hosted most CDX infrastructure
  - 9 racks, each with 20 physical servers
  - BT nets designed by Green Team and White Team
  - 12 miniature factories, each equipped with a butane flame for "detonation"
  - Blue Teams and Red Teams accessed the game via OpenVPN

#### Blue Teams
- **Composition**:
  - 6 Blue Teams
  - Each team consisting of 6-10 personnel from Northern European governments, military, private sector, and academia
- **Network Configuration**:
  - Identical, pre-built, and fairly insecure networks
  - 20 physical PC servers and 28 virtual machines
  - 4 VLAN segments: DMZ, INTERNAL, HMI, and PLC
  - Many elements unpatched, vulnerable, misconfigured, with poor passwords and keys, and some pre-planted malware

#### Game Environment
- **Hardware**:
  - 2x 2.2GHz Xeon processors
  - 2 GB RAM
  - 80 GB HDD
  - 2 10/100Mbit Ethernet interfaces
- **Software**:
  - VMware Server 2.0.2 on Gentoo Linux
  - 2 segments: management and game

#### BCS SCADA Simulation
- **Simulation**:
  - Power generation company
  - Production, management, and distribution
  - GE PLCs and Cimplicity HMI terminals
  - Historian databases
- **Model Factories**:
  - 2 model factories per Blue Team network
  - Model Steam Engine
  - GE PLC

#### Network Hardening
- **Blue Team Preparation**:
  - No prior access to the CDX environment
  - Provided somewhat outdated network documentation
  - Allowed to install and modify existing software
  - Limited number and type of applications and services required
  - Prohibited from conducting offensive cyber attacks against other Blue Teams or the Red Team

#### Red Team
- **Composition**:
  - 20 volunteer "angry environmentalist hackers"
  - Attacks began slowly and intensified over time
  - No limits on hacker tools and techniques
  - Attacks confined to the CDX environment
- **Internal Structure**:
  - Four sub-teams: client-side, fuzzing, web app, and remote
  - Early access to the CDX environment for simulated reconnaissance

#### Visualization
- **Components**:
  - Network topography
  - Traffic flows
  - Chat channels
  - Team workspaces
  - Observer reports
  - Terrestrial map
  - Scoreboard

#### Red Team Campaign
- **Phases**:
  1. **Declaration of War**:
     - Hacker ultimatum: deface Blue Team websites
     - Message: "Cease operations and convert to green power... or face crippling cyber attack!"
     - Defaced 5 out of 6 sites within 30 minutes
  2. **Breaching the Castle Wall**:
     - Compromised one server in each Blue Team's DMZ and one INTERNAL workstation
     - Created a steady stream of incident reports
     - Example: live A/V feed from a Blue Team workspace within one hour
  3. **Owning the Infrastructure**:
     - Attempted to compromise as many DMZ and INTERNAL systems as possible
     - First day: 42 successful compromises, including web and email servers, and an MS-SQL SCADA report server
     - Balanced, sustained pressure on all Blue Teams
  4. **Wanton Destruction**:
     - Attacked and destroyed any Blue Team system
     - Not a wise decision, leading to issues in scoring and gameplay

#### Vulnerabilities and Exploits
- **Exploited Vulnerabilities**:
  - Publicly-known vulnerabilities (e.g., MS03-026, MS04-011, MS06-040, MS08-067, MS10-025)
  - Flaws in VNC, Icecast, ClamAV, SQUID3
  - Hacked web applications (Joomla, WordPress) using SQL injection, local/remote file inclusion, path traversal, and XSS
- **Other Techniques**:
  - Account cracking, online brute-forcing, DoS with fuzzing tools, password hash dumps, "pass-the-hash," Slowloris, NTP daemon and Squid3 DoS, SYN flood
  - Backdoors (e.g., Poison Ivy, Zeus, Optix, netcat, custom-made code)
  - Metasploit for deploying reverse backdoors
  - Crontab changes to drop firewall rules
  - One zero-day client-side exploit for most browsers

#### Successful Blue Team Strategies
- **Linux**:
  - AppArmor, Samhain, custom short shell scripts
- **Windows**:
  - AD group policies, CIS SE46 Computer Integrity System, KernelGuard, central collection of logs
- **All OSs**:
  - White/blacklisting, IP blocking, black hole routing

#### Goals and Outcomes
- **Goals Met**:
  1. Successful "live fire" CDX
     - Blue Teams experienced defending Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and SCADA
     - "Cyber terrorist" scenario explored
     - Minimal downtime reported
  2. International composition of teams
     - Over 100 personnel from more than 7 countries
     - Strengthened cross-border relationships

#### Lessons Learned
- **White Team**:
  - More manpower needed for communications, scoring, observation, and adjudication
  - One White Team member per Blue Team and two for the Red Team
  - Pre-CDX "mechanics" day to test connectivity and bandwidth
  - Clear rules and scoring
- **Client-Side Attacks**:
  - Consider "dumb users" or no client-side attacks to avoid wasting browser zero-days
- **Technical Issues**:
  - Avoid using VMware Server Console due to performance issues
  - Blue Teams should have some network administrative rights
- **Team Dynamics**:
  - Authoritative team leaders from the start
  - Lawyer on the White Team
  - No "wanton destruction" phase

#### Final Thoughts
- **Real-World Relevance**:
  - CDX challenges mirror real-world challenges
  - IT is complicated, dynamic, and evolving
  - Defenders may not see the same attack twice
  - The intangible nature of cyberspace makes victory, defeat, and battle damage highly subjective
