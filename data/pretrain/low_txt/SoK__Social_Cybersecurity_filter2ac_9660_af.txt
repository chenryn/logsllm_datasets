### Addressing the Social-Technical Gap in Security and Privacy (S&P) Systems

Individuals often adapt their ideal social behaviors to align with S&P settings or adjust their S&P behaviors to minimize social friction. However, as illustrated in Figure 1, there has been relatively little prescriptive systems work aimed at addressing this social-technical gap. Ignoring human social behaviors in the design of S&P systems can lead to maladaptive user behaviors that either reduce security, cause social friction, or both. Conversely, by designing S&P systems that account for and leverage human social behaviors, there is an opportunity to enhance both the efficacy and the widespread adoption of these systems.
