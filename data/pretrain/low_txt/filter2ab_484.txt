### Title: Automated Discovery of Deserialization Gadget Chains

Although the risks associated with deserializing untrusted data have been well-known for many years, unsafe deserialization remains a persistent and significant vulnerability. The attention on Java deserialization vulnerabilities surged in 2015 when Frohoff and Lawrence published a Remote Code Execution (RCE) gadget chain in the Apache Commons library. More recently, at last year's Black Hat conference, Muñoz and Miroshis presented a comprehensive survey of dangerous JSON deserialization libraries.

While much of the research and automated detection technology has focused on identifying vulnerable entry points—i.e., code that deserializes untrusted data—the process of discovering a "gadget chain" to exploit these vulnerabilities has largely remained a manual task. In this talk, I will introduce a novel technique for the automated discovery of deserialization gadget chains in Java. This approach enables defensive teams to rapidly assess the severity of a deserialization vulnerability and allows penetration testers to quickly develop working exploits.

At the conclusion of the presentation, I will also release a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) toolkit that implements this methodology. This toolkit has been successfully used to develop numerous deserialization exploits in both internal applications and open-source projects.
