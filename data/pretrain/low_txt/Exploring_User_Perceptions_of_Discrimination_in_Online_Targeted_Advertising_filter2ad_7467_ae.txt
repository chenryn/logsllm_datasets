### Ethical Considerations in Targeted Advertising

#### Introduction
The ethical use of targeted advertising has been a subject of numerous recommendations and policy documents [1, 18, 25]. Among these, only the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) policy document explicitly mentions discrimination as a potential, unethical consequence. Our research, along with prior studies that have highlighted instances of discrimination (e.g., [13, 37]), underscores the importance of considering discrimination in ad targeting. We found that 43% of respondents rated our discriminatory advertising scenarios as a significant or moderate problem. Specifically, in more problematic demographic scenarios, 53% of respondents viewed it as a significant or moderate problem, while even in less problematic behavioral scenarios, 34.2% did so. Therefore, we propose that guidelines, especially those issued by government agencies, should include explicit language about discrimination to address this common concern.

#### Key Findings
Our findings indicate that while respondents distinguish between behavioral and demographic targeting, they are not particularly concerned with whether an algorithm was involved in the outcome. This suggests that focusing on the algorithmic nature of the ad ecosystem may not be effective in addressing public concerns.

Our results represent a broad cross-section of users' opinions but do not provide normative guidelines for what is appropriate. Many forms of discrimination that may seem acceptable to the general public today may, in fact, be illegal, immoral, or unjust. Activists and advocates concerned about online discrimination can use our work as a starting point to better understand where more education, persuasion, and lobbying for new regulations may be most needed.

#### Regression Analysis
Table 18 presents regression results for ethical behavior by the end user (n=891), where an odds ratio (OR) greater than 1 indicates stronger disagreement that the end user behaved ethically.

| Factor         | OR   | CI            | p-value |
|----------------|------|---------------|---------|
| T-Asian        | 0.91 | [0.65, 1.27]  | 0.574   |
| T-Black        | 1.05 | [0.75, 1.47]  | 0.789   |
| Behavior       | 1.15 | [0.87, 1.51]  | 0.321   |
| Advertiser     | 0.94 | [0.71, 1.24]  | 0.656   |
| Human          | 0.91 | [0.69, 1.20]  | 0.509   |
| Age of respondent HS+ | 1.00 | [0.99, 1.01] | 0.566   |
| BS+            | 0.96 | [0.64, 1.44]  | 0.845   |
| R/E-Asian      | 0.68 | [0.46, 1.00]  | 0.051   |
| R/E-Black      | 1.90 | [0.97, 3.74]  | 0.063   |
| R/E-Hispanic or Latino | 1.57 | [0.97, 2.53] | 0.067   |
| SSI            | 1.30 | [0.76, 2.24]  | 0.340   |
|                | 1.03 | [0.76, 1.40]  | 0.839   |

#### Future Work
Our work addresses only a small portion of the critical topic of online algorithmic discrimination. Our results highlight an important distinction between users' perceptions of scenarios involving explicitly racial versus implicitly racial, online-behavior-based discrimination. However, we explored only web-history-based targeting, and future work may seek to explore whether users react similarly to other types of behaviors or if certain online behaviors are more sensitive.

Future research is also needed to explore reactions to discrimination based on factors other than race. Our initial pilot results suggested that users did not feel as strongly about topics such as pre-existing health conditions, at least in our advertising scenario. This should be explored in further detail in a wider range of scenarios.

Additionally, we only explored user perceptions of scenarios involving advertising discrimination, and only in the context of a potentially desirable ad (for a job). It would be interesting to explore whether reactions remain the same when the ad in question is potentially undesirable, such as related to bail bonds or drug-abuse treatment.

Related work [17, 35] has also shown evidence of discrimination in search results, pricing, insurance, and other services. Thus, future work could focus on exploring and comparing user reactions to discriminatory results in a variety of settings.

Finally, the concrete regression models described in Section 5.3 were not tested for predictive power against independent test data. Such validation would be valuable for those interested in accurately predicting people’s responses to cases of discrimination.
