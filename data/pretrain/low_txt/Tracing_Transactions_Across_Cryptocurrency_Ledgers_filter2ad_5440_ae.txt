### Transactions in a Small Time Period

We began by hypothesizing that transactions occurring within a small time window would likely be associated with trading bots. To test this, we searched for consecutive ShapeShift transactions involving the same currencies and carrying approximately the same value (with a 1% error margin). This initial search yielded thousands of such sets. To narrow down the results, we added the condition that there must be at least 15 transactions within a five-minute span, all involving the same currencies and carrying the same approximate USD value. This refined criterion resulted in 107 distinct sets.

### Refining Trading Clusters

After identifying these 107 trading clusters, we removed transactions that appeared to be false positives. For instance, in a cluster of 20 transactions where 19 were ETH-BTC and one was LTC-ZEC, we excluded the LTC-ZEC transaction. This left us with clusters of either a single currency pair (e.g., ETH-BTC) or two pairs sharing a common input or output currency (e.g., ETH-BTC and ZEC-BTC), suggesting either the purchase of a rising coin or the dumping of a declining one.

To further validate these clusters, we used our heuristic from Section 7.2 to check if the clusters shared common addresses. While we typically did not find this in UTXO-based currencies (due to the use of multiple addresses by most entities), in account-based currencies, we found that almost every cluster involved a specific address.

### Summary of Results

Our findings are summarized in Figure 6, which shows the most common currency pairs and the total amount exchanged by trading clusters using those currencies. The most frequent interactions occurred between popular currencies, with the exception of Monero (XMR) and SALT. Specifically, we identified six clusters of 17-20 transactions exchanging BTC for XMR and 13 clusters exchanging BTC for SALT, an Ethereum-based token. Each cluster contained between 16 and 33 transactions, totaling 258 transactions, each shifting exactly 0.1 BTC. These transactions originated from 514 different Bitcoin addresses. However, after applying our pass-through heuristic, we found that only two distinct SALT addresses were used to receive the output, indicating that this activity likely involved one or two entities.

### Usage of Anonymity Tools

Given the potential for ShapeShift to be used for money laundering or other criminal activities, we investigated the extent to which users attempted to hide the source of their funds. While using ShapeShift is already a form of anonymity, we focused on the combination of ShapeShift and "privacy coins" (Dash, Monero, and Zcash), which offer enhanced anonymity guarantees.

#### Impact of KYC Introduction

The introduction of Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements into ShapeShift had varying effects on the usage of privacy coins. For Zcash, the number of transactions using Zcash as the input currency averaged 164 per day before KYC and 116 per day after. Similarly, for Zcash as the output currency, the average decreased from 69 to 43 per day. Monero and Dash saw more significant declines. Monero's daily average as the input currency dropped from 136 to 47, and as the output currency, from 316 to 62. For Dash, the daily average as the input currency fell from 128 to 81, and as the output currency, from 103 to 42.

#### Analysis of Blockchain Data

Our analysis of blockchain data, focusing on the most popular currencies, is restricted to Dash and Zcash. We leave an exploration of Monero for future work.

### Zcash

Zcash's main anonymity feature is the shielded pool. Transparent Zcash transactions behave like Bitcoin transactions, revealing the sender, recipient, and value. However, when interacting with the shielded pool, this information is hidden to varying degrees. We considered three types of interactions between ShapeShift and the shielded pool:

1. **Direct Shift to Shielded Pool**: 29,003 transactions used ZEC as the output currency, with 758 having a z-address as the output, indicating direct transfer to the shielded pool. The total value put into the pool was 6,707.86 ZEC, or 4.3% of all ZEC received in pass-through transactions.
2. **Shift to t-Address and then to Shielded Pool**: 1,309 transactions involved putting money into the pool after shifting to a t-address. The total value put into the pool was 12,534 ZEC, or 8.2% of all ZEC received in pass-through transactions.
3. **Direct Transfer from Shielded Pool to ShapeShift**: 111,041 pass-through transactions used ZEC as the input currency, with 3,808 coming directly from the pool, totaling 22,490 ZEC, or 14% of all ZEC sent in pass-through transactions.

While the usage of Zcash's anonymity features was not a large fraction of overall Zcash usage in ShapeShift, there is clear potential to move large amounts of ZEC (over $10 million at the time of the transactions) by combining ShapeShift with the shielded pool.

### Dash

Dash's main anonymity feature is PrivateSend, a type of CoinJoin. A CoinJoin allows multiple users to send coins to different recipients in a single transaction, making it difficult to link inputs and outputs. In Dash, PrivateSend transactions are restricted to specific denominations (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 DASH) to prevent de-anonymization.

We identified three types of interactions:

1. **DASH Sent to ShapeShift from CoinJoin**: Out of 100,410 candidate transactions, 2,068 came from a CoinJoin, carrying a total of 11,929 DASH, or 6.5% of the total value across transactions with DASH as the input currency.
2. **CoinJoin After Receiving DASH from ShapeShift**: Out of 50,545 candidate transactions, only 33 were CoinJoin transactions, carrying a total of 187 DASH, or 0.1% of the total value across transactions using DASH as the output currency.

Revisiting our results on U-turns in Dash, we found that while 5.6% of U-turns used the same UTXO, 64.6% used the same address, suggesting additional on-chain transactions, often CoinJoins, between the two ShapeShift transactions. This indicates a genuine attempt to use Dash's privacy features, though it was ineffective due to the reuse of the same address.

### Conclusions

In this study, we characterized the usage of the ShapeShift trading platform over a thirteen-month period, focusing on the ability to link together the ledgers of multiple cryptocurrencies. Our techniques demonstrate the possibility of capturing complex transactional behaviors and tracing activity across ledgers, which has implications for criminals attempting to obscure their financial flows.
