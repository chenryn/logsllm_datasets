### Performance Analysis of Tunable Tor and Vanilla Tor

At selection level 0, Tunable Tor disregards router performance, prioritizing the equality of router selection. This results in a lower fraction of trials (62%) completing within one minute compared to higher selection levels. However, at selection level 5, Tunable Tor significantly outperforms vanilla Tor, with 69% of trials completing within one minute. At even higher selection levels, Tunable Tor consistently outperforms vanilla Tor. For instance, at selection level 15, 85% of trials complete within one minute.

To further analyze the long-tail statistics, Figure 6 presents the 90th percentile of transfer times for both known routers (those with available bandwidth data) and all routers (including those without bandwidth data) at various selection levels, as well as for vanilla Tor. The poor long-tail performance of vanilla Tor is evident, particularly during high load conditions, where routers that advertise their full capacity (as shown in Figure 1(a)) become overloaded, leading to degraded performance. In contrast, Tunable Tor avoids these overloaded routers, resulting in better performance at higher selection levels.

Figure 7 provides the mean transfer times with 95% confidence intervals for known routers at different selection levels, including vanilla Tor for comparison. The data shows that while the median time for vanilla Tor is only 35 seconds, the mean time is more than twice that, at 84 seconds. For Tunable Tor, the mean time decreases as the selection level increases, as expected.

### Anonymity Analysis

The proposed improvements aim to enhance resistance to subversion. One measure of this is the number of routers an intelligent attacker must compromise to have a high probability of compromising a tunnel. Intuitively, uniform router selection increases the number of required compromises, while skewed selection towards certain routers decreases it. To quantify this, we use the Gini coefficient, a measure of equality often used in economics. A Gini coefficient of 0 represents perfect equality (all routers chosen equally), while a coefficient of 1 represents perfect inequality (the same router always chosen).

Figure 8 shows the Gini coefficients for various selection levels and for vanilla Tor. Several observations are noteworthy: 
- The highest equality is at selection level 0, and the lowest at selection level 15.
- Uniform selection from all available routers (selection level 0) still yields a non-zero Gini coefficient due to the non-uniform presence of routers over time.
- All selection levels below 13 show a more balanced selection than vanilla Tor.

Comparing Figures 8 and 7, the tradeoff between performance and anonymity becomes clear, highlighting the need for users to choose the appropriate balance based on their needs.

To further examine the effects of selection inequality, Figure 9 plots the success of an attacker who controls a certain fraction of the top-performing routers. At high selection levels, a small fraction of compromised routers can significantly compromise tunnels. Conversely, at low selection levels, a much larger fraction of compromised routers is needed to compromise even a small fraction of tunnels. For example, at selection level 0, even if an attacker controls the top 10% of routers, the chance of a compromised tunnel is only 4%.

### Related Work

Our findings on the variability of Tor performance align with a comparative study of Tor and AN.ON [29], which also showed large standard deviations in bandwidth values. Bauer et al. [3] considered distributed probing as a defense against low-resource attacks but rejected it due to the extra load on the system and the potential for malicious nodes to falsely respond to probes. In our case, distributed measurements are performed opportunistically, imposing no extra load and corresponding to real traffic.

Several projects aim to optimize latency in anonymous communications. Sherr et al. [24] propose using geographic coordinates to create paths within selected bounds. Renner [21] developed a controller for Tor to select paths that minimize latencies. Extensions like the Tor button [26] and FoxTor [23] allow users to trade off performance and anonymity by selectively enabling or disabling Tor. Other work focuses on improving cryptographic operations [19, 15].

A peer-to-peer design where all users contribute forwarding capacity has been proposed to improve overall Tor performance [22, 10, 18]. However, Tor designers avoided this approach due to Sybil attacks [9], and existing peer-to-peer designs are either insecure [28, 4] or not scalable [10].

### Conclusions and Future Directions

In this paper, we proposed improvements to the existing Tor router bandwidth evaluation and router selection algorithms. These changes result in a more secure and performant Tor protocol, allowing users to select their preferred balance of performance and anonymity. Evaluations show that these changes can increase average throughput by almost three times with a modest decrease in anonymity, or they can drastically improve anonymity while maintaining similar throughput. Additionally, the proposed improvements reduce the long tail of the transfer time distribution, enhancing user-perceived performance.

Future work includes studying the whole-network effects of the proposed changes using a simulation of the Tor network, examining other aspects of the performance-anonymity tradeoff, and further investigating the observed characteristics of the Tor network.
