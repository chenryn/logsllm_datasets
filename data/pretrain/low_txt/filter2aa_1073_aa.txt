## The Modern Internet: The Price of Convenience

> "One can easily remain free of even the most intense political oppression simply by placing one’s faith and trust in institutions of authority."
> — Glenn Greenwald
>
> "When I am afraid, I put my trust in you."
> — Psalm 56:3

### A State of Trust

- **Technological Innovation**
  - Open source
  - Web and data standards
  - Shared protocols
  - Interoperability
- **Benefits**
  - Cost-effective applications
  - Faster time-to-market
  - Cross-domain content
  - Convenience

### A State of Convenience

- **Benefits**
  - Improved application usability
  - Google/Facebook login
  - Everything at our fingertips
  - Multiple devices linked to accounts
  - Simplification
  - Ease of cross-domain navigation
- **Concerns**
  - Privacy
  - Anonymity
  - Potential for abuse
  - Loss of control

### A State of Control

- **Questions**
  - Who owns our data?
  - Are we simply a source?
  - Are we greater than the sum?
- **Loss of Control**
  - Data retention and oversight
  - Legal compliance
  - Security breaches
  - Overall transparency
- **The Bottom Line**
  - We must address these issues to regain control.

### A State of Change

- **The Truth**
  - Convenience doesn’t require trust.
  - There is no need to give up control.
  - We have the power to change the world.
- **The Path Forward**
  - Become advocates for distrust.
  - Break the mold of old and stale thinking.
  - Create something secure and beautiful.
  - Open up the Internet for digital self-expression.

### A Brief History: From FTP to µTorrent

> "The increase of disorder or entropy is what distinguishes the past from the future, giving a direction to time."
> — Stephen Hawking, *A Brief History of Time*
>
> "Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves."
> — Aaron Swartz

### Centralized Model

- **Client-Server**
  - S/FTP
  - Usenet
  - IRC
  - File Systems (NTFS, Samba, NFS)
- **Web-Based**
  - MediaFire
  - Mega(upload)
  - RapidShare
  - Streaming (Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Go, Revision 3, Crackle, Hulu, Aereo (RIP))
- **Cloud Computing**
  - Microsoft Azure, OneDrive
  - Amazon Web Services
  - Google Drive
  - Dropbox

### Decentralized Model

- **Peer-to-Peer**
  - BitTorrent
  - Instant Messenger
  - IRC (DCC)
  - Napster
- **Content Distribution**
  - Rsync
  - Plex
  - Streaming (XBMC, Chromecast, DLNA)

### File Sharing Problems

- **Insecure**
  - Trusting a third-party source
  - Revealing your identity
  - Legality issues
- **Inflexible**
  - Availability everywhere at all times
  - Forced synchronization across all devices
  - Offline access
- **Inconvenient**
  - Watching shows you pay for
  - Antiquated revenue models (ads)
- **Unreliable**
  - Exclusive content and licensing disputes
  - Network outages
  - Insufficient seeders
- **Expensive**
  - Cloud storage (Dropbox, Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Go)
- **Unfair**
  - Varying usage patterns
  - Acquisition vs. Aggregation

### Hybrid Model

- **Inadequacy Breeds Innovation**
  - Niche market for solutions (VPNs, proxies, firewalls, Darknet, PeerBlock, Tor, local APs)
  - Addressing symptoms, not the root problem
- **Reinventing File Sharing**
  - Leverage the power of our Internet access
  - Create a hybrid model combining the best of centralized and decentralized models
  - Secure, anonymous, free, and accessible everywhere

### A Recipe for Change: From Lemons to Fruity Juice

> "If you want to achieve something, you build the basis for it."

> "The only way to keep a secret is to never have one."
> — Julian Assange

### 1) Authoritative Source

- **Overview**
  - Primary repository of trusted data
  - Give away the authoritative source and control of sensitive data
- **Data**
  - Foundation of file sharing
  - First to be secured, last to be compromised
  - Online data storage should never leave our control
- **Including**
  - Power to protect what’s ours
  - Certainty that data is protected
  - Choice to respond to attacks
  - Ability to remain anonymous
- **The Solution**
  - Take responsibility
  - Reclaim the authoritative source
  - Do what companies fail to do
  - Secure our data

### 2) Stateless Authentication

- **Overview**
  - What does it mean to authenticate?
  - Stateful (data storage, antiquated and unnecessary, reliance on trusted third parties)
  - Stateless (shared secret authentication, mutual coexistence by shared knowledge, no registration or data storage, dynamic encryption algorithms)
- **Benefits**
  - Redefine authentication
  - Create temporary trust
  - Social network shared secrets
  - No data storage
  - Transitory nature of stateless authentication
  - Quick alteration of dynamic encryption schemes

### 3) Modular Security

- **Overview**
  - Based on layered security
  - Division of authority and separation of duties
  - Double-blind (inability to store complete secrets)
- **Existing Applications**
  - Tempting targets for takedown
  - Single points of failure
  - Reveal too much information
- **Plausible Deniability**
  - Assume someone is always listening
  - Better to be paranoid than caught
  - They can’t audit what you don’t have
- **The Solution**
  - Multiple modules of defense resist penetration
  - Messages increase strength as they propagate
  - Each module is isolated, autonomous, self-sufficient, and resistant to attacks

By addressing these areas, we can reinvent file sharing and save cyberspace.
