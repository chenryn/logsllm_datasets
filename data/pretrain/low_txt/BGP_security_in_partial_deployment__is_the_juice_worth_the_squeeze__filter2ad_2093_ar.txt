### Insecure BGP and S*BGP Deployment Challenges

#### Introduction
Insecure BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is a well-known issue in the Internet's routing infrastructure. Section 3.1 of this document discusses the vulnerabilities associated with insecure BGP. However, it is important to assume that these vulnerabilities exist and to address them appropriately.

#### Non-Monotonicity and Security Examples
- **Non-Monotonicity Example:**
  - **Security Second (AS52142):** 
    - Victim: AS40426 (Pandora)
    - Attacker: Iranian ISP (AS12880)
    - Tokens: t2_100_cp_stub
  - **Collateral Benefit, Security Second (AS5166):**
    - Victim: AS40426 (Pandora)
    - Attacker: Iranian ISP (AS12880)
    - Tokens: t2_100_cp_stub
  - **Network Information:**
    - Telekomunikacja Polska S.A.
    - Cogent (AS174)

- **Collateral Benefits Example:**
  - **Security Third:**
    - Victim: AS40426 (Pandora)
    - Attacker: Iranian ISP (AS12880)
    - Tokens: t2_100_cp_stub
  - **Network Information:**
    - Yahoo! (AS10310)
    - Rostelecom Russia (AS12389)
    - ZAO N-Region Russia (AS34223)
    - State Institute of Info Tech Russia (AS3267)

#### Impact of Partially-Deployed S*BGP
- **Average Fraction of Sources:**
  - The metric changes, secure routes under normal conditions, secure routes after an attack, collateral damages, and collateral benefits are illustrated. Secure routes given to unhappy and happy nodes, as well as downgrades, are also considered.

- **Attack Analysis:**
  - An attack fails against fully-deployed S*BGP. However, [22] does not analyze the interactions between S*BGP and BGP during partial deployment (e.g., Table 3).
  - [8] includes cryptographic analysis of S*BGP in partial deployment, and an Internet draft [27] mentions protocol downgrade attacks. Neither explores the impact of attacks on partially-deployed S*BGP or the number and type of ASes harmed by such attacks.

#### Conclusion
- **Guidelines for Partially-Deployed S*BGP:**
  1. **Lightweight Simplex S*BGP at Stub ASes:** Deploying lightweight simplex S*BGP at stub ASes reduces deployment complexity without compromising overall security.
  2. **Consistent Routing Policies:** Incorporating S*BGP into routing policies in a similar fashion at all ASes avoids introducing routing anomalies like BGP Wedgies.
  3. **Deployment at Tier 2 ISPs:** Deploying S*BGP at Tier 2 ISPs can improve security, as deployments at Tier 1s may have limited impact.

- **Limited Security Benefits:**
  - On average, partially-deployed S*BGP provides limited security benefits over route origin authentication when ASes do not prioritize security first.

- **Future Work:**
  - We hope our work will highlight the challenges of partial deployment and drive the development of solutions to overcome them. One idea is to limit protocol downgrade attacks, which cause many negative results. For example, adding "hysteresis" to S*BGP can prevent an AS from immediately dropping a secure route when a better insecure route appears. Alternatively, creating "islands" of secure ASes that prioritize security first for routes between ASes in the island could be explored, without disrupting existing traffic engineering or business arrangements.
  - Other security solutions, such as origin authentication with anomaly detection and prefix filtering, could also be effective and easier to deploy based on the RPKI.
