### Proof of O(1) Amortized Shortcuts Maintenance Time

To complete the proof that the maintenance time for shortcuts is O(1) amortized, we need to show that a linear number of operations must occur before a linear-time recomputation of shortcuts is required. To achieve this, we can consider the effect of insertions and deletions as implicitly redefining the notion of a centroid to be more flexible than the standard "no subtree of size more than n/2 when the centroid is removed."

Specifically, let's hypothetically replace the notion of a centroid with that of a c-approximate-centroid: a node whose removal leaves subtrees with sizes no more than \( cn \) for some constant \( c \geq 0.5 \) (e.g., \( c = 3/4 \)). If we do this, our claim of O(log log n) performance would still hold, with only the constant factor behind the "O" notation changing.

Initially, before any insertions or deletions, the shortcuts are consistent with the rigid (i.e., n/2) notion of a centroid. When a recomputation of shortcuts is initiated, the shortcut edges violate every c-approximate-centroid notion. This means that, for a specific subtree with \( n \) nodes, a linear number of insertions and deletions must have occurred for the shortcuts to transition from being consistent with a rigid n/2 centroid to not being consistent with a (e.g.) (3n/4)-approximate-centroid. This completes the proof.

### More General Hierarchies

Although the previous section focused on trees, the basic ideas can be extended to more general hierarchies. In a more general graph, the notion of a centroid is replaced by that of a separator—a "small" subset of vertices whose removal leaves connected components of size no more than \( cn \) for some constant \( c = O(1) \).

Such separators are known to exist:
- A separator of size \( O(\sqrt{n}) \) exists for planar graphs [32].
- The entire recursive separator structure for such a graph can be computed in linear time [20].
- More general classes of graphs, such as those of bounded genus, also have small separators [19]. Bounded genus captures most RBACs (Role-Based Access Control), and even the class of genus zero (planar graphs) captures many commonly found "practical" RBACs.

### Conclusions and Future Work

In summary, we present the first solution to the problem of access control in an arbitrary hierarchy \( G \) with the following properties:
1. Only hash functions are used for a node to derive a descendant’s key from its own key.
2. The space complexity of the public information is the same as that of storing graph \( G \).
3. The derivation by a node of a descendant’s access key requires \( O(l) \) bit operations, where \( l \) is the length of the path between the nodes, for arbitrary hierarchies and \( \log \log n \) or less for trees.
4. Updates are handled locally and do not propagate to descendants or ancestors of the affected part of \( G \).
5. The scheme is resistant to collusion, meaning no subset of nodes can conspire to gain access to any node they cannot legally obtain.
6. The private information at a node consists of a single key associated with that node.

We also provided simple modifications to our scheme to handle Crampton’s extensions of standard hierarchies to "limited depth" and reverse inheritance [13], and gave shortcut schemes that significantly reduce key derivation time for tree hierarchies.

Future directions of this work include:
1. Extending our scheme to support temporal constraints.
2. Extending our scheme to support "limited depth" permission inheritance in access graphs that are not layered without adding virtual nodes and in a collusion-resistant manner.
3. Developing a more comprehensive shortcut scheme for general hierarchies.

The authors thank anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback on this work. We are also grateful to Nelly Fazio for her comments on the security proof of the scheme and her suggestions for improving its security. Her work, which shows the security of the scheme under key indistinguishability, will be included in the full version of the paper and reported elsewhere.
