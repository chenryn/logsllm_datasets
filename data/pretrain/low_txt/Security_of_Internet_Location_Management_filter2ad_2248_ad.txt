### 6.2. Limiting Damage

A node can protect itself from resource exhaustion attacks by setting a limit on the amount of resources (e.g., processor time, memory, and communication bandwidth) it allocates to such activities. When this limit is exceeded, communication must be prioritized. For example, a MIPv6 node that exceeds its resource limit should stop sending or accepting Binding Updates (BUs) and allow binding cache entries to expire. Although communication can continue via the mobile's home network, this is suboptimal. The node should attempt to resume normal operation aggressively once it believes the attack has ceased.

Ingress filtering at the local network can mitigate resource exhaustion attacks by making it easier to trace the attacker and filter out unwanted packets.

### 6.3. Favoring Regular Customers

The correspondent's local security policy can be defined to allow BUs from high-priority mobiles or those with which it has a long-term relationship or recent meaningful communication. This decision could be based on state information from upper protocol layers, though implementing this is challenging. In some common scenarios, it may be worthwhile to violate the layering principle. For instance, a web server could accept BUs from clients after successfully executing the TCP handshake. Similarly, the mobile may favor selected correspondent addresses, such as those with which the mobile user has explicitly initiated communication.

Updating existing entries in the Binding Cache can help maintain optimized routes during a DoS attack, although it is uncertain whether the existing cache entries belong to the most important mobiles or even authentic ones. Some indication of this can be inferred from the packet counts associated with the traffic flowing through each entry.

### 6.4. Balancing Message Flows

Reflection attacks can be discouraged and traffic amplification prevented by ensuring that the ingress filtering at the local network applies. The correspondent should only respond to the same address from which it received a packet, and only with a single packet of the same size. Reflection can be prevented only if the attacker's packets are filtered. Sometimes this can be achieved by rearranging messages, but it might be necessary to add new messages and pad existing ones with dummy data. The question is whether the cost of these protections is more acceptable than the threat created by reflection and a small constant factor of amplification.

Figure 2(c) shows the final version of our BU-authentication protocol with an additional message to balance the message flows. Note that the correspondent can remain stateless because it responds to message 1a with 2a and to message 1b with 2b, without associating the two exchanges. The exchanges are parallel, so the total time taken by the protocol is not significantly increased. (Indices i and j are needed to make the correspondent stateless.) The mobile, on the other hand, needs to receive both messages 2a and 2b before sending the authenticated BU.

### 7. The Right Level of Protection

We conclude this paper by discussing the criteria for selecting and comparing BU authentication protocols and the issues that arise when there are several alternative protocols.

#### 7.1. Prioritizing the Goals

It is essential to implement any protection mechanism if the security of other nodes or communication between other nodes depends on it. Therefore, preventing bombing attacks against third parties (Section 4.1) should have the highest priority when designing a secure location management protocol. In practice, this means making the return routability test (Section 4.2) mandatory. When only the node's own security and availability depend on a countermeasure, the decision can be left to each node. This is the case with most other resource-exhaustion attacks (Section 5) and, in fact, with the authentication of BU origin (Section 3). However, it is important to realize that if a server node does not require an adequate level of authentication from its clients, the service may become unusable under attack.

In MIPv6, binding updates are an optimization, and a node can always protect itself and others by not sending BUs or ignoring received ones. This means communicating always via the mobile's home network. This strategy can be followed when simplicity of implementation is the primary goal.

#### 7.2. Multiple Levels of Authentication

The computational and communicational capabilities of Internet nodes vary widely, as does the level of security they require. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a range of authentication protocols with different cost and security trade-offs. For example, closed high-security groups could use pre-established shared keys or a PKI, most nodes CGA authentication with return routability tests for DoS prevention, and low-end mobile devices a protocol based only on RR. However, care must be taken to accommodate multiple levels of protection so that the attacker cannot bid down to the lowest level.

In MIPv6, the decision about accepting or rejecting a BU is made by the correspondent. Therefore, the correspondent will always make the final decision about the required level of authentication for a particular mobile. It makes little sense for the correspondent to allow multiple levels of authentication for the same mobile node because the attacker could always tackle the weakest one. Thus, the mobile must either authenticate itself using the protocol chosen by the correspondent or give up binding updates. Protocol negotiation is counterproductive unless the mobile's choices can be strongly authenticated.

A technique similar to CGA addresses can be used to express the mobile's choice. The idea is to hash the list of acceptable protocols together with the mobile's public key and routing prefix when forming the interface identifier (i.e., the second half of the IP address). An alternative proposal is to reserve type bits in the IP address to indicate whether the address is cryptographically generated or of another type. Both techniques are based on the observation that if the mobile's choice of protocol is encoded into the IP address, the attacker cannot interfere with it.

It is worth noting that as long as bombing of third parties is prevented, different correspondents can make their choice of authentication strength independently. This is because a weak mechanism accepted by one correspondent will not help the attacker to redirect packets to or from correspondents that use a stronger protocol. The correspondent can also have a local policy that mandates a stronger (e.g., shared key authentication or PKI) or weaker (e.g., plain RR) level of authentication for a particular home address or range of addresses.

However, there is the risk that business reasons will force practically all IP nodes to use the weakest level of authentication that is mandatory to implement and use. For example, if many low-end mobiles only implement the weakest standardized protocol, virtually all correspondents will default to this mechanism, which would defeat the purpose of having any stronger protocol.

### 8. Conclusions

We described attacks against Internet location management protocols, with a particular focus on Mobile IPv6 binding updates. Some of these attacks are new in the sense that they had not been considered in the IETF Mobile IP Working Group before our threat analysis. Specifically, the flooding attack against third parties (Section 4.1) has been ignored in many Internet protocols that update location or routing information. We also suggested and analyzed mechanisms for protecting the protocol participants and third parties. The ideas presented in this paper formed the basis for the development of a secure location management protocol for Mobile IPv6, which uses only symmetric cryptography and follows the lines of Figure 2(c). We hope that this work will help to secure other Internet mobility protocols as well.
