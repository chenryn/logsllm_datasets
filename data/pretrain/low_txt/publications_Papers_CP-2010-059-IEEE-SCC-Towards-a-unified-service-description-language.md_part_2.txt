### 2. Service Level (R4)
The Service Level (SL) represents the quantitative and qualitative characteristics associated with a service, typically formalized in a Service Level Agreement (SLA). USDL supports the representation of these characteristics, which include:

- **Quantitative Characteristics**: These can be measured using concrete metrics such as service execution time, availability, performance, and reliability.
- **Qualitative Characteristics**: These specify the expected features of a service, such as non-repudiation and encryption.

USDL categorizes SL into four main classes:
- **Performance**: The time required to deliver a particular service.
- **Dependability**: The ability to deliver a service as intended based on SLA binding contracts.
- **Security**: The security level associated with the service execution, including aspects like authentication, integrity, confidentiality, and non-repudiation.
- **Rating**: A mechanism managed by marketplaces to establish trust and confidence between providers and consumers based on feedback from interest groups, communities, or experts.

### 3. Bundling (R2)
Bundling is a strategy where multiple services are offered as a single package. USDL supports two types of bundling:
- **Pure Bundling**: Consumers must buy all bundled services together.
- **Mixed Bundling**: Consumers have the option to buy bundled services or individual services.

Bundles in USDL can be associated with a process model that describes the preferred or advisable invocation order of services.

### 4. Marketing (R1, R3)
Marketing aims to create a mutually profitable and sustainable relationship between a provider and its consumers. In USDL, marketing is expressed through the following classes:
- **Pricing**: Indicates the possible pricing models for a service, including flat-rate, pay-per-unit, two-part tariff, variable tariff, and commission. Additional pricing models can be defined using USDL's extension mechanisms.
- **Documentation**: Provides official documentation available on the service, supplied by the provider or broker, and includes user guides, flyers, promotional campaigns, videos, programmer guides, brochures, etc.
- **Certification**: Attests that a provider has specialized skills, knowledge, and experience in a particular field, such as ISO 9000, PMI, and Microsoft certifications.

### 5. Extension Mechanisms (R5)
USDL includes extension mechanisms to accommodate domain-specific requirements. These mechanisms allow for the creation of new sub-perspectives (business, operational, and technical) and new properties. Measurement systems can be attached to extensions to associate physical quantities with new properties, enabling scoping and monitoring. For example, the telecommunication-specific property ASR (Answer-Seizure Ratio) can be associated with a new measurement system.

### 3.2. Operational Perspective
The operational perspective focuses on the elementary operations undertaken to provide a service, bringing beneficial change or added value to consumers. This perspective helps providers manage resource flows, define operations, and design resource provision layouts. Consumers can use this information to understand how service operations are choreographed, while providers can define how operations are orchestrated.

### 1. Operations (R3)
USDL uses a system theory approach to describe the operations of a service. Each operation has an input and output interface, forming a contract between the service and the outside world. Ports represent resources, allowing for abstraction from internal service intricacies and focusing on how service operations can be composed based on the resources manipulated. Operations can be classified as manual, automated, or automatic.

### 2. Classification (R3)
The Classification class allows associating a service and its operations with one or more categorizations based on standard or private industrial taxonomies. This mechanism enables service providers and marketplaces to classify services, making them easier for consumers to discover. USDL supports multiple classification schemes, including custom and standard systems like UNSPSC and NAICS.

### 3. Functionality (R3)
Functional descriptions provide information about what a service does, ignoring details on invocation and execution. USDL allows for natural language, keywords, and ontologies to describe functionality. This multifaceted approach ensures comprehensive and flexible functional descriptions.

### 3.3. Technical Perspective
The technical perspective references existing Internet standards for interacting with services and is divided into seven subsections: transport protocols, messaging protocols, metadata exchange protocols, security protocols, reliable messaging protocols, transaction protocols, and user interfaces. For example, a consulting service might use HTTPS and SMTP for transport, WS-EventNotification for messaging, WS-ReliableMessaging for reliable messaging, and Flex for the user interface.

### 3.4. USDL and Universal Descriptions
To enhance the metadata associated with business services, USDL introduces the concept of universal description (UDescription). This class allows adding domain-specific semantics, providing a complete solution to describe each USDL entity. A universal description includes a name, textual description, set of keywords, and ontological concepts. This approach enhances the description of suppliers, partners, and resources using syntactic and semantic knowledge.

### 4. Marketplace Applications
USDL has been applied in three projects at SAP Research, addressing multi-step process-based services, manual or automated services, and the management of services in a financial ecosystem. These applications highlight the importance of multiple views, non-functional conformance, and extensibility in service descriptions.

### 5. Related Work
USDL builds on various sources, combining technical and business-related service descriptions. It incorporates QoS attributes like availability, reliability, response time, and security parameters, and also supports comprehensive pricing models. USDL draws parallels with the management of service level agreements, serving as blueprints for service contracts.

### 6. Conclusions
Marketplaces operating in the Internet of Services (IoS) will drive a new "service industry" for provisioning, brokering, reselling, and operating business services. USDL addresses the need to formalize non-technical aspects of services, such as pricing, benefits, marketing, quality of service, and legal requirements. It also considers variability, strategic bundling, multiple views, non-functional conformance, and extensibility. USDL's applicability and suitability have been evaluated in three service marketplace use cases, with further evaluation planned.
