### Tamper-Proof and Isolated from the Operating System

Tamper-proof solutions that are isolated from the operating system (OS) are essential for secure one-time password (OTP) generation. However, such OTP solutions are typically based on Intel Core processors and are not available on ARM processors. TrustOTP aims to combine the flexibility of software tokens with the security of hardware tokens.

### Security Analysis of Mobile Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Alexandra et al. [21] analyzed potential attacks on mobile two-factor authentication (2FA) schemes and provided valuable high-level research directions to counter these attacks. Our work falls into the category of leveraging secure hardware on mobile platforms to provide a trusted user input/output interface to a trusted OTP application, even when the Rich OS and the trusted OTP application share the same touchscreen and display. We achieve this by using ARM TrustZone to isolate TrustOTP from an untrusted Rich OS.

### ARM TrustZone and Secure Computing Domains

ARM TrustZone technology can isolate a secure OS from a Rich OS, creating two distinct computing domains. This isolation ensures that untrusted applications in a compromised Rich OS cannot access secure applications in the secure OS [55, 15, 53, 33]. Several TrustZone-based systems, such as Mobicore/Trustonics [33], Trusted Logic [53], ObCs [40, 23], and KNOX [48], have been developed to enhance the security of mobile devices. For example, MobiCore/Trustonics [33] is a secure operating system for TrustZone-enabled ARM controllers, including ARM1176 or CortexA8/A9, and provides development tools called Trustlets for third-party application developers.

### Research Efforts on TrustZone

Numerous research efforts have focused on enhancing the capabilities of TrustZone. Jang et al. [37] built a secure channel between the normal and secure domains. Azab et al. [17] leveraged the secure domain to protect the integrity of the Rich OS kernel in real time. Sun et al. [51] performed reliable memory dumps of the Rich OS in the secure domain. Santos et al. [49] used TrustZone to build a trusted language runtime that supports the .NET Framework in the secure domain. Marforio et al. [43] proposed a new location-based second-factor authentication solution using smartphones as location verification tokens for point-of-sale transactions. Pawel et al. [22] combined TrustZone with a customized PANTA display processor [25] to provide trusted input and output, ensuring strong I/O isolation between the two execution environments. However, this approach may have compatibility issues and increase costs due to the need for a dedicated co-processor. Li et al. [41] provided a verifiable mobile ad framework to detect and prevent advertisement frauds, using a verifiable display technique similar to TrustOTP.

### Development and Emulation Frameworks

Winter et al. [56] developed a flexible software emulation framework for TrustZone development. Since major smartphone vendors lock the TrustZone in their commercial products to protect their OEM software, researchers often use development boards [29, 7, 19] or emulators [56] with TrustZone support enabled. Our prototype was built on a Freescale i.MX53 development board [29].

### Conclusions

We designed a secure OTP token solution called TrustOTP, which uses smartphones to achieve both the security of hardware tokens and the flexibility of software tokens. Our design can prevent all types of attacks from a malicious mobile OS and continue to display the OTP even if the mobile OS crashes. It is flexible enough to support various OTP algorithms and multiple OTP instances on a single smartphone. The solution requires no changes to the mobile OS and has minimal impact on its performance. A prototype demonstrated that TrustOTP operates efficiently with minimal additional power consumption.
