Although DeCaptcher does not pay PixProfit workers double the amount for solving these CAPTCHAs, it consequently increases its profit margin on the new CAPTCHA types.

**Figure 12: ImageToText Error Rate for Custom Asirra CAPTCHA Over Time.**

We designed a CAPTCHA suitable for use with standard solver image APIs. Figure 11 provides an example. The instructions "Find all cats" were written in English, Simplified Chinese, Russian, and Hindi at the top, as most workers speak one of these languages. We submitted this image every three minutes to all services over 12 days. ImageToText demonstrated remarkable adaptability to this new CAPTCHA type, successfully solving it 39.9% of the time on average. Figure 12 illustrates the declining error rate for ImageToText; as time progressed, workers became increasingly adept at solving the CAPTCHA. The next closest service was BeatCaptchas, which succeeded 20.4% of the time. The remaining services, excluding DeCaptcher, had success rates below 7%.

Coincidentally, while we were evaluating our own version of the Asirra CAPTCHA, on January 17th, 2010, DeCaptcher began offering an API method that supported it directly—albeit at $4 per 1,000 Asirra solves (double its base price). Microsoft had deployed the Asirra CAPTCHA on December 8th, 2009, on Club Bing. The demand for solving this CAPTCHA was apparently strong enough that DeCaptcher took only five weeks to incorporate it into their service. We then performed the same experiment using the new DeCaptcher API method and received 1,494 responses. DeCaptcher successfully solved 696 (46.5%) requests with a median response time of 39 seconds, about 2.3 times its median of 17 seconds for regular CAPTCHAs.

### 6.6 Targeted Sites

Customers of CAPTCHA-solving services target various websites. Using our worker accounts on Kolotibablo and PixProfit, the public worker sites of Antigate and DeCaptcher, respectively, we identified the targeted websites. Over 82 days, we recorded over 25,000 CAPTCHAs from Kolotibablo and 28,000 CAPTCHAs from PixProfit.

To identify the origin of these CAPTCHAs, we first grouped them by image dimensions. Most groups consisted of a single CAPTCHA type, which we confirmed visually. We then attempted to identify the websites from which these CAPTCHAs were taken. In this manner, we identified 90% of Kolotibablo CAPTCHAs and 94% of PixProfit CAPTCHAs.

Table 3 shows the top five CAPTCHA types observed on Kolotibablo and PixProfit, with the remaining identified CAPTCHA types (18 CAPTCHA types in both cases) representing 14% and 4% of the CAPTCHA volume on Kolotibablo and PixProfit, respectively. Both distributions of CAPTCHA types are highly skewed: on PixProfit, the top two CAPTCHA types represent 81% of the volume, with the top five accounting for 91%. Kolotibablo is not quite as concentrated, but the top five still account for 76% of its volume.

Clearly, the markets for these services differ. Although Microsoft is the most common target for both, PixProfit caters to CAPTCHAs from large global services (Google, Yahoo, AOL, and MySpace), whereas Russian sites dominate Kolotibablo (VKontakte.ru, Mail.ru, CAPTCHA.ru, Mamba.ru, and Yandex)—a demographic that correlates well with the observed worker fluency in Russian for Antigate (Table 2).

### 7. Discussion and Conclusion

By design, CAPTCHAs are simple and easy for humans to solve. Their "low-impact" quality makes them attractive to site operators who are wary of any defense that could deter visitors. However, this same quality has made them easy to outsource to the global unskilled labor market. In this study, we have shed light on the business of solving CAPTCHAs, showing it to be a well-developed, highly competitive industry with the capacity to solve on the order of a million CAPTCHAs per day. Wholesale and retail prices continue to decline, suggesting a demand-limited market. An informal survey of several freelancer forums indicates that workers in search of CAPTCHA-solving work greatly outnumber CAPTCHA-solving service recruitments.

One may well ask: Do CAPTCHAs actually work? The answer depends on what we expect CAPTCHAs to do.

**Distinguishing Computers and Humans:**
The original purpose of CAPTCHAs is to distinguish humans from machines. To date, no completely general means of solving CAPTCHAs has emerged, nor is the cat-and-mouse game of creating automated solvers viable as a business model. In this regard, CAPTCHAs have succeeded.

**Preventing Automated Site Access:**
Today, the retail price for solving one million CAPTCHAs is as low as $1,000. For well-motivated adversaries, CAPTCHAs are an acceptable cost of doing business when measured against the value of gaining access to the protected resource. Email spammers, for example, solve CAPTCHAs to gain access to webmail accounts from which to send advertisements, while blog spammers seek to acquire organic "clicks" and influence search engine results. Thus, in an absolute sense, CAPTCHAs do not prevent large-scale automated site access.

**Limiting Automated Site Access:**
However, it is short-sighted to evaluate CAPTCHAs in isolation. They exert friction on the underlying economic model and should be evaluated in terms of how efficiently they can undermine the attacker's profitability. A CAPTCHA reduces an attacker's expected profit by the cost of solving the CAPTCHA. If the attacker's revenue cannot cover this cost, CAPTCHAs as a defense mechanism have succeeded. For many sites (e.g., low PageRank blogs), CAPTCHAs alone may be sufficient to dissuade abuse. For higher-value sites, CAPTCHAs place a utilization constraint on otherwise "free" resources, below which it makes no sense to target them.

Taking email spam as an example, let us suppose that each newly registered webmail account can send some number of spam messages before being shut down. The marginal revenue per message is given by the average revenue per sale divided by the expected number of messages needed to generate a single sale. For pharmaceutical spam, Kanich et al. [14] estimate the marginal revenue per message to be roughly $0.00001; at $1 per 1,000 CAPTCHAs, a new webmail account starts to break even only after about 100 messages sent. Thus, CAPTCHAs naturally limit site access to those attackers whose business models are efficient enough to be profitable despite these costs and act as a drag on profit for all actors. MR. E reported that while his service had thousands of customers, 75% of traffic was generated by a small subset of them (5–10).

**The Role of CAPTCHAs Today:**
Continuing our reasoning, the profitability of any particular scam is a function of three factors: the cost of CAPTCHA-solving, the effectiveness of secondary defenses (e.g., SMS validation, account shutdowns, additional CAPTCHA screens, etc.), and the efficiency of the attacker's business model. As the cost of CAPTCHA solving decreases, site operators must employ secondary defenses more aggressively to maintain a given level of fraud.

Unfortunately, secondary defenses are invariably more expensive in terms of infrastructure and customer impact compared to CAPTCHAs. However, a key observation is that secondary defenses need only be deployed quickly enough to undermine profitability (e.g., within a certain number of messages sent, accounts registered per IP, etc.). Indeed, the optimal point for this transition is precisely the point at which the attacker breaks even. Before this point, it is preferable to use CAPTCHAs to minimize the cost burden to the site owner and the potential impact on legitimate users. While we do not believe that such economic models have been carefully developed by site owners, we see evidence that this kind of tradeoff is being made. For example, popular sites like Google now make aggressive use of secondary mechanisms to screen account sign-ups (e.g., SMS challenges), but only after a CAPTCHA is passed and some usage threshold is triggered (e.g., multiple sign-ups from the same IP address).

In summary, we argue that CAPTCHAs, while traditionally viewed as a technological impediment to an attacker, should more properly be regarded as an economic one, as witnessed by a robust and mature CAPTCHA-solving industry that bypasses the underlying technological issue completely. Viewed in this light, CAPTCHAs are a low-impact mechanism that adds friction to the attacker's business model and thus minimizes the cost and legitimate user impact of heavier-weight secondary defenses. CAPTCHAs continue to serve this function, but as with most defensive mechanisms, they become less efficient over time.
