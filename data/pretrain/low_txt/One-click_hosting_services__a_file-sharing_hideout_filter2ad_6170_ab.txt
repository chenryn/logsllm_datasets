# RapidShare: User Behavior and Traffic Analysis

## 1. Introduction
RapidShare, a one-click hosting (OCH) service, provides users with a download bandwidth ranging from 200-2000 kbps. Users can only perform one concurrent download at a time, and the maximum size of an uploaded file is 200 MB (recently increased from 100 MB). There is also a mandatory wait time between successive downloads. To encourage content uploads, RapidShare offers "points" to uploaders each time their content is downloaded. These points can be exchanged for Premium accounts or extra download capacity. This incentive system has enabled RapidShare to store a vast variety of content, including songs, movies, games, software, and books.

It is important to note that RapidShare is not responsible for any copyright violations due to illegal file sharing conducted using their infrastructure. Uploaders must declare that the uploaded content is not protected by copyright laws, and RapidShare is further legally protected by not offering any indexing or search facilities for the content they store.

## 2. Main Datasets
Table 1 summarizes the main dataset used in this study, referred to as our "client-side" traces. We collected flow traces in the IPFix format and HTTP packet headers at two monitoring locations:

- **Monitor1**: The main Internet access link of a National Research Network serving about 10,000 students and academics.
- **Monitor2**: The main Internet access link of a University campus network serving about 1,000 students and faculty.

Both monitoring points are located in Europe and have a user base primarily composed of university students. While these demographics may be biased, our analysis focuses on information that is unlikely to be influenced by age and location.

- **Monitor1** data cover about 4 months, with approximately 750 unique client IP addresses accessing RapidShare.
- **Monitor2** data cover about 5 months, with approximately 450 unique client IP addresses accessing RapidShare.

These numbers represent an upper bound on the number of actual RapidShare users, as some users may use DHCP. Identification of RapidShare flows was performed using the HOST header field of HTTP requests (searching for the string "rapishare.com"). Additional datasets are described later in the paper when first introduced.

## 3. Traffic Volume Analysis
In this section, we examine the traffic volume generated by OCH services, particularly RapidShare, in our client-side traces. We compare the traffic volume with Web, BitTorrent, and major video streaming services.

- In **Monitor1**, OCH services generate 3.32% of the total traffic volume, which is low compared to BitTorrent (44.5%) but a significant fraction (25%) of the total HTTP traffic (12.8%).
- In **Monitor2**, the fraction of OCH traffic is significantly lower.

Figure 2 shows the aggregate traffic rate downloaded from all OCH services in hourly intervals. The hourly rates vary widely, often reaching up to 10-20 Mbps, even though the long-term average is only about 1 Mbps.

RapidShare generates more than 80% of the OCH traffic volume in our traces. Figure 3 compares the average daily download rate of RapidShare with YouTube and GoogleVideo, showing that RapidShare generates more or comparable traffic volume than these major content providers.

Figure 4 shows the hourly traffic rate for Web and OCH traffic during a randomly selected week in September 2008 at Monitor1. OCH traffic follows a similar diurnal pattern to Web traffic, with less activity during evening hours and weekends.

## 4. Characterization of RapidShare Clients
This section focuses on the characteristics of RapidShare clients active in our two university traces.

### 4.1 Flow Sizes and Client Downloads
We analyze the flow sizes downloaded by RapidShare clients. Figure 5 shows the CDF of the download flow sizes for all RapidShare connections. 

- 50% of the flows are smaller than 700B at Monitor1 and 7KB at Monitor2.
- 90% of the flows are smaller than 150KB at both monitors.

Smaller flows likely correspond to web page accesses, failed/stopped downloads, or web page refreshes. The remaining 10% of the flows, which transfer more than 150KB, are likely actual downloads. We use a threshold of 150KB to distinguish between "content download flows" and "browsing flows."

Figure 6 shows the complementary CDF (C-CDF) of content download flow sizes. For larger flows, we observe significant drops at 100MB and 200MB, corresponding to the maximum upload file size limits enforced by RapidShare.

### 4.2 Daily Downloads per User
Next, we examine the number of daily content downloads per user. Most clients perform more than one download per day (57% at Monitor2), and only 23% of clients perform more than 10 downloads in the same day. Figure 7 shows the C-CDF of the daily number of content download flows per client at Monitor2, approximated by a Pareto distribution with a shape parameter of 0.66, indicating extremely large variability.

### 4.3 Premium vs. Free Users
RapidShare supports two user types: Free and Premium. Free users are limited in terms of upload flow sizes, concurrent downloads, and download throughput (throttled to 200-2000 kbps). Figure 8 shows the distribution of the average download rate per user, suggesting that most users are Free users, while a small fraction (around 12%) are Premium users, experiencing download throughput up to 14 Mbps.

### 4.4 File Popularity
We examine the files shared by RapidShare clients, focusing on the popularity of individual files. Figure 9 shows the popularity of each file as the number of clients that downloaded it. More than 75% of the files were downloaded only once, and very few files were highly popular. This suggests that caching RapidShare files close to clients would offer little benefit, supporting a centralized infrastructure.

### 4.5 Summary
Our results show that more than half of the clients perform more than one file download per day, mostly by non-paying users with download throughput up to 2 Mbps. A significant fraction (around 12%) is willing to pay for Premium service, experiencing download throughput up to 14 Mbps. The users' daily activity mainly involves downloading a small number of files, often corresponding to a single media object. The popularity of unique files differs significantly from traditional web browsing, suggesting that caching RapidShare content close to clients would offer little benefit.

## 5. Service Architecture
In this section, we explore the RapidShare architecture based on information from our client-side traces and active measurements, including the number of deployed servers, their network connectivity, geographical location, load balancing, and content replication strategies.
