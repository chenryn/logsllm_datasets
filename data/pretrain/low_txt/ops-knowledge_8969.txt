### Log Summary

This log chunk, spanning from 18:08:03 to 18:08:08 on October 18th, documents several recurring issues within the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Resource Manager (RM) communication. The key points are:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures:**
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component is unable to renew the lease for the client `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]`.
   - The failure persists for a duration of 186 to 191 seconds.
   - The system logs a warning and indicates that it will retry the lease renewal shortly.

2. **Address Changes:**
   - The system detects changes in the server address for both the HDFS and RM components.
   - The old address `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` is updated to `msra-sa-41:9000` for the HDFS server.
   - Similarly, the RM server's address changes from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`.

3. **Resource Manager Communication Errors:**
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempts to connect to the RM server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The connection attempts fail, and the system logs an error indicating the failure to contact the RM.
   - The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1 second between each attempt.

- **18:08:04:**
  - **RM Connection Retry:** The `RMCommunicator Allocator` retries connecting to the RM server at `msra-sa-41:8030` with a retry policy of 10 attempts and 1-second intervals.
  - **RM Contact Error:** The system logs an error indicating a failure to contact the RM.
  - **Lease Renewal Failure:** The `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 187 seconds.
  - **Address Change:** The HDFS server address changes again from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.

- **18:08:05:**
  - **Address Change:** The RM server address changes from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
  - **Lease Renewal Failure:** The `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 188 seconds.

- **18:08:06:**
  - **RM Connection Retry:** The `RMCommunicator Allocator` retries connecting to the RM server at `msra-sa-41:8030` with the same retry policy.
  - **RM Contact Error:** The system logs an error indicating a failure to contact the RM.
  - **Lease Renewal Failure:** The `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 189 seconds.
  - **Address Change:** The HDFS server address changes again from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.

- **18:08:07:**
  - **Address Change:** The RM server address changes from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
  - **Lease Renewal Failure:** The `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 190 seconds.
  - **Address Change:** The HDFS server address changes again from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.

- **18:08:08:**
  - **RM Connection Retry:** The `RMCommunicator Allocator` retries connecting to the RM server at `msra-sa-41:8030` with the same retry policy.
  - **RM Contact Error:** The system logs an error indicating a failure to contact the RM.
  - **Lease Renewal Failure:** The `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 191 seconds.
  - **Address Change:** The HDFS server address changes again from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.

### Conclusion

The log indicates a series of failures in lease renewal and resource manager communication, along with frequent address changes. These issues suggest potential network or configuration problems that need to be addressed to ensure the stability and reliability of the Hadoop cluster.
