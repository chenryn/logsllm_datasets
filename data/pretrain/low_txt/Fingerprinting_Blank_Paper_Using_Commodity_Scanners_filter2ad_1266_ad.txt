### Application of Our Technique

The practical application of our technique may not be immediately apparent. According to European police, over half of the works in international art markets are forgeries [19]. One family of art forgers managed to make $2 million before being caught. The ability of forgers to replicate individual brush strokes makes it increasingly difficult to authenticate paintings. In the most sophisticated forgeries, art verifiers often have to rely on the chain of custody to authenticate a work [20]. However, we believe that it would be challenging to duplicate the detailed features of the canvas, including the weave pattern. Therefore, applying a technique like ours to the canvas, particularly on its back side, could help detect art authenticity or forgery.

### Lottery Tickets

Lottery tickets share similarities with currency, but players do not need to be aware of the fingerprinting technique. To claim winnings, a lottery ticket must be verified by the lottery authority. The fingerprint of a winning ticket does not need to be printed on the document. Instead, fingerprints of all possible winning tickets can be privately maintained. Claimants must produce the actual winning ticket with a correctly verified fingerprint to collect their winnings.

### Product Packaging

The accurate identification of paper-based product packaging can also benefit from this technique. When inspecting cargo, customs officials often check the contents of packages to identify counterfeit goods. By authenticating the product's packaging, we can increase confidence in the package's contents. If the packaging is legitimate, the likelihood of the contents being authentic is much higher.

### Privacy Implications

The feasibility of paper-based authentication highlights some undesirable security risks. Since our method does not modify the paper, there is no way to detect whether a piece of paper has been fingerprinted in advance by an adversary. This challenges the traditional assumption that pieces of paper cannot be easily traced without distinguishing marks. Even unopened reams of blank printer paper could, in principle, be fingerprinted at the factory.

For example, in an optical-scan voting system, the secrecy of ballots relies on the assumption that individual paper ballots are indistinguishable. Our work shows that this assumption may not hold. A corrupt official could scan blank ballots in advance and record a unique fingerprint for each ballot. If ballots are distributed in a predictable order and the order of voters is recorded, ballots can be re-identified after the election. Moreover, because pre-scanning leaves no evidence, a rumor about such an attack would be difficult to disprove, making coercion and vote-buying more credible.

More generally, the ability to re-identify ordinary sheets of paper raises concerns about any purportedly private information gathering process that relies on paper forms. "Anonymous" surveys or reporting systems may not, in fact, be anonymous. While it has long been possible to track paper using subtle chemical markers or "invisible ink," these methods require special expertise and leave evidence of the attack. Our research shows that an attacker with only a commodity scanner can reliably re-identify paper without leaving any telltale marks.

### Conclusion and Future Work

Our work demonstrates that ordinary pieces of paper can be fingerprinted and later identified using commodity desktop scanners. This technique functions like a "biometric" for paper, allowing original documents to be securely and reliably distinguished from copies or forgeries. Two key questions remain for future work: 

1. In a threat model where the adversary has access to the original document and the fingerprint, it is uncertain whether a clever adversary can forge a copy with a high-resolution printer.
2. While we conjecture that our method can be applied to other materials such as fabric, more testing is needed to verify this, and special methods might be required for some materials.

These questions will be addressed in future research. Our results highlight the resolution capabilities of today's scanners. As scanner technology advances, it will capture even more detailed images of paper documents, eventually allowing individual wood fibers to be imaged clearly. The security of our methods against forgery will ultimately depend on the race between the resolution of printers that can create patterns on a page and the resolution of scanners that can observe these patterns.

#### Alternative Strategies for Fingerprinting and Verification

**Using Albedo vs. Normals:**
High-resolution scans reveal color variations and surface texture. An alternative approach is to use the albedo (color) of the page as the basis for a fingerprint. This method is simpler and faster, as it requires only a single scan. However, it may not resist forgers who use very light ink to print a desired pattern. Additionally, black ink introduces a bias in the dot products, requiring zeroing out of values outside the normal distribution. This provides an opportunity for forgers to deliberately zero out regions, making albedo-based fingerprints suitable for applications where some added risk of forgery is acceptable.

**Patch-Pair Comparisons:**
In the standard algorithm, the vector \( p \) contributes \( K \) bits to the overall fingerprint by taking the signs of the dot product of \( p \) and a series of ortho-normal template vectors. An alternate version considers the signs of the dot products of pairs of patches \( p \) and \( q \). For example, for 64 patches, each patch would participate in 63 bits, generating a total of 2016 bits. This approach is more robust against attacks, as any attack on a single bit affects multiple bits. However, the bits generated from all patch pairs are less independent than those generated by the template vectors, making the "template" scheme generally preferred.

**Short Fingerprints with No Error-Correcting Information:**
For applications requiring less security, fewer feature vector bits (e.g., 100 bits) can be used. An attacker, without the original, must guess among \( 2^{100} \) bit sequences, checking guesses against the hash. This leaves the naive authentication process with no error correction. A better approach involves flipping bits based on the likelihood that they have flipped, using a truncated normal distribution model. This method is simple to implement and provides no information to an attacker. However, it does not scale well to longer bit sequences and provides only probabilistic guarantees of running time, making it suitable for offline verification with fallback to online methods when necessary.
