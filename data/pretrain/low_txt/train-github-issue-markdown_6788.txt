### Current Behavior
I have two `<select>` elements bound to the same list. After changing the selection a few times, I noticed that items from the first `<select>` are being overridden by the selection in the second `<select>`. This issue occurs when testing different binding types on the `<select>` element, such as using `ngValue`, `value`, and a `change` event.

### Expected Behavior
The list instance should remain unchanged, regardless of the selections made in either `<select>` element.

### Minimal Reproduction
This behavior appears to be random. To reproduce the issue, you will need to change the selections in both dropdowns multiple times until both `<select>` elements contain only one duplicated object. 

A Plunker demonstrating this behavior on version 2.4.7 can be found [here](http://plnkr.co/edit/u4Owq7NeP5GMlUGrR9Oa?p=preview).

### Motivation / Use Case
This issue is encountered during testing and prototyping.
