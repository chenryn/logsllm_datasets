### HashGen and Hash_DRBG Overview

**HashGen** is a hash generating function utilized in the **Hash_DRBG** (Deterministic Random Bit Generator) algorithm, as defined in NIST SP 800-90A [26]. The DRBG generates a sequence of pseudorandom bits from an initial seed. If the seed has sufficient entropy and is unknown, the output of the cryptographic DRBG is unpredictable [10]. Kan et al. demonstrated that Hash_DRBG is secure when using an appropriate hash function, such as SHA-256 [16].

#### Algorithm 1: Identity Block Generation Process
**Input:** Initial values for \( V \), \( C \), and \( c \)  
**Output:** Next candidates block for temporary identity

1. `returned_bits` ← HashGen(\( V \))
2. \( H = \text{Hash}(0x03 || V) \)
3. \( V = V + H + C + c \)
4. \( c = c + 1 \)
5. `realloc_identity_block` = `returned_bits`
6. return `realloc_identity_block`

This algorithm is used for temporary ID reallocation. The variables are defined as follows:
- \( V \): Updated value during each call to the DRBG.
- \( C \): Constant value that depends on the seed.
- \( c \): Counter indicating the number of requests for pseudorandom bits.

If the block size is 256 bits, it can generate 8 outputs of 30-bit length with a single operation.

### M-TMSI and GUTI Generation

The M-TMSI (MME Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity) part of the GUTI (Globally Unique Temporary UE Identity) has a total length of 32 bits, but the two most significant bits are fixed for legacy network compatibility [2]. Therefore, 30 bits are needed from the Hash_DRBG. Using a CPRNG (Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator), we can generate a random GUTI while avoiding collisions as per requirement R3.

To check for preemption of a randomly generated temporal ID, a bitmap structure can be used. For 30-bit M-TMSIs, the MME needs 2^30 bins. A bitmap structure that can denote 8 bins with 1 byte requires 128 MB of memory. The occupancy can be checked via simple bitwise operations. Since Hash_DRBG can be based on SHA-256, the computational overhead is negligible [12]. Pre-generating a few M-TMSIs can reduce online generation overhead. For an MME with 40 million subscribers, the probability of generating a preempted value is negligible [12].

### Temporary Identifier Allocation in 3GPP

3GPP recognizes requirements R1, R2, R3, and R5. Solutions #7.23 and #7.24 in the 3GPP report [1] differ from our approach. These solutions bind KASME (the key shared between the MME and the subscriber) to generate the GUTI, which is unnecessary if a sufficiently random seed is used. For collision avoidance, Solution #7.23 suggests using MAC (Message Authentication Code), while Solution #7.24 proposes increasing the M-TMSI length to 64 or 80 bits. Both are costly and require major changes to UEs and MMEs, whereas our solution only needs a small MME update.

### Conclusion

Mobile network operators and standards have invested significantly in identity management to ensure subscriber confidentiality. However, incomplete specifications and incorrect implementations by carriers leave subscribers vulnerable to privacy leaks. We examined 28 carriers across 11 countries and identified three vulnerabilities: rarely changed temporary identities, predictable allocation logic, and lack of resilience to excessive allocation requests. We implemented smart attacks to locate victims and proposed a solution involving frequent updates of unpredictable temporary identities. Our solution can be deployed with minimal overhead, ensuring secure confidentiality for subscribers.
