Access-related data for employees is imported from log files generated by various vendor tools. This section includes:

- **Accounts**: View a list of correlated, uncorrelated, and soft link accounts. For each account, you can view the access-related information for a particular user on the selected data source.

### Resource Behavior Profiles
Behavior profiling analyzes user activities on a company network by collecting all user privileges, resources, and activities, establishing a baseline of normal behavior, and identifying abnormal or outlier behaviors. Behavior profiles are generated based on attributes in the data source, specified during policy creation.

- **Example**: For the policy "Rare Service Creation," if one service account is created on Windows per day, ArcSight UBA establishes a baseline of one daily for the resource. If two service accounts are created on Windows in one day, ArcSight UBA detects the rare behavior as an outlier and generates a violation.

#### Viewing Behavior Profiles
- **Select a Policy**: Choose a policy configured for the data source to view the behavior profile.
- **Type Dropdown**: Select options to view Resource Behavior, Account Behavior, and Account Names.
- **Note**: Menu options may vary based on the violation entity selected during policy creation.
- **Resource Behavior**: Shows baseline activities for the selected resource and any anomalies that deviated from the baseline over time.
- **Account Behavior**: Shows account behavior over time for the selected resource.
- **Account Names**: Shows the behavior profile for the account over time for the selected resource.
- **Time Range**: Select a time range (daily, weekly, monthly, day of week, or time of day) to view the behavior baseline.
- **Filter Data Points**: Click **All Attributes** to filter the data points on which to view the baseline. The baseline is defined as the maximum value for a valid cluster.

### Watch List
A watch list is a tool for closely monitoring entities based on inherent risks. It helps to monitor users, accounts, hosts, etc., that are deemed problematic and require special attention.

- **Examples**:
  - A user with an upcoming termination event.
  - A malware-infected account.

#### Managing Watch Lists
- **Access Watch Lists**: Navigate to **Menu > Views > Watch Lists**.
- **Select a Watch List**: From the left navigation panel, type text to filter the list or use the **Advanced Options** menu to search for a specific watch list. Click the delete icon to delete a watch list.

  - **(Optional) Location**: Enter a location for the members of the watch list.
  - **Click Add**: The entities will be added to the watch list.
- **Removing Members**: Select one or multiple users from the list of members and click **Remove Member(s)**.

### White List
ArcSight UBA uses white lists to specify entities that are exempt from monitoring by the application. You can create the following types of white lists for an entity:

- **Global**: The white list applies to the entity. The application will not flag violations for any policies running in the environment.
- **Targeted**: The white list applies to both the entity and a specific policy or policies. The application will not flag violations for specified policies.

#### Managing White Lists

- **View Available White Lists**: The left navigation panel displays the list. Type text to filter the list or use the **Advanced Options** icon to search.
- **Create a New White List**: Click **+** to expand the menu and click **Create WhiteList**. Complete the following information and click **Save**:
  - **Whitelist Name**: Provide a unique name for the white list. Example: `VIP Users`.
  - **Whitelist Entity Type**: Select an entity type (User, Activity Account, Resources, Activity IP, Violator).
  - **Whitelist Type**: Select from the dropdown (Global, Targeted).
- **Adding Members to White Lists**:
  - **Select a White List**: From the left navigation panel, click **Add Member(s)**.
  - **Complete Information**: In the **Add Member(s)** dialogue box, complete the following:

    - **Whitelist Forever**: Enable if the members will remain on the whitelist forever. Disable to enter an expiry date.
    - **Comments**: Enter comments about the whitelist or members.
    - **Reduce Risk Score**: Enable to reduce the risk score of the user. The selected user will be skipped next time they violate a policy. Disable to retain the user's risk score.
    - **Click Add**: Confirm by clicking **Yes** in the **Add Whitelist Confirmation** dialogue box.

### Lookup Tables
A Lookup Table is similar to an Excel table, functioning as an index for faster processing. The lookup function is used to find a one-row or one-column range (known as a vector) for a value and returns a value from the same position in a second one-row or one-column range.

- **Example**: An Excel spreadsheet contains Resources to Business Unit mappings required to populate the business unit name against the resources table in the application. You can use a pre-processor or a stored procedure to reference this spreadsheet to obtain the corresponding values for each resource name and then populate the resource table with the business unit name for each resource.

#### Managing Lookup Tables
- **Access Lookup Tables**: Navigate to **Menu > Views > Lookup Tables**.
- **View Imported Lookup Tables**: The left navigation panel displays the imported Lookup Tables. Type text to filter the list or click the delete icon to delete a Lookup Table.
- **View Data**: Click the name of the Lookup Table to view its data. You can perform a search on the data in any field.
