### Introduction
**Ezio Manzini and Eduardo Staszowski**

#### Research Notes
1. **Emerging Phenomenon:** 
   - A global trend is emerging where people are organizing to solve daily problems collaboratively, driven by social, economic, and technological factors. This connectivity enables new forms of organization and activism, leading to a wave of social innovations.
   
2. **Support and Recognition:**
   - These local social innovations need recognition and support to endure and spread. Public actions that facilitate peer-to-peer collaborations can lead to a new generation of collaborative public services, where end users become co-producers.

3. **Reshaping Public Services:**
   - The relationship between people and the public sector needs to be reshaped. Promising strategies include leveraging collaborations, using existing technologies creatively, and forming new organizations.

4. **Public Collaboration:**
   - Two promising paths for public service improvements are:
     - **People-Centered Approach:** Involving end-users more intensively in the research, prototyping, testing, and implementation of services.
     - **People-Led Services:** Engaging agencies and citizens in co-production, where users design and implement their own service programs with support from public agencies.

5. **Key Questions:**
   - How can emerging social networks influence public services and innovation policies?
   - How can innovation policies empower and direct these networks?
   - What role can design play in making these connections more effective?

These questions formed the basis for the "Public & Collaborative Thematic Cluster," a design research initiative started in October 2011 and promoted by the DESIS Network.

#### Design Schools and the Public Realm
1. **Role of Design Schools:**
   - Design schools can drive the diffusion of design for social innovation by generating new visions, defining and testing tools, and starting and supporting projects. They bring fresh ideas, have the tools to build prototypes, and foster critical thinking.
   - **Opportunities:** Fresh ideas, prototype building, and critical thinking.
   - **Limitations:** Timing and maturity issues when involving students.

2. **DESIS Network:**
   - The DESIS network and its labs offer possibilities to bring fresh ideas into social conversations, develop original research projects, and elaborate critical thoughts.

#### Open Questions
1. **How do public agencies change when people are considered part of the solution?**
   - DESIS Labs learned that empowering both the public and public agencies is crucial. The challenge is to shift the role of public agencies from service providers to active partners.

2. **Can social innovation trigger public sector innovations, and vice versa?**
   - Strong grassroots initiatives can attract support from public agencies, which can recognize and collaborate with them to promote innovations in public services and policies.

3. **Should we create experimental spaces for conceiving and prototyping new solutions?**
   - Public agencies could create "testing environments" where different actors can meet, interact, and develop prototypes. These spaces facilitate the transition from social inventions to mature enterprises and allow public agencies to experiment with new policies and governance tools.

### Box 1: DESIS Thematic Clusters
- **Definition:** Groups of design teams working on similar topics, aiming to discuss ongoing projects, compare tools and results, and start new joint initiatives.
- **Purpose:** To create focused design research environments where specific design knowledge is produced, a common language is built, and scenarios and solutions are developed.

### Box 2: "Public & Collaborative Thematic Cluster"
1. **Development:** The cluster developed from the observation that several design schools and DESIS Labs were already researching public services and related topics.
2. **Participants:** Parsons The New School for Design, Politecnico di Milano, Aalto University, Designmatters at Art Center College of Design, Carnegie Mellon University, Central Saint Martins, ENSCI, Institute without Borders, La Cambre, Mad Faculty, Malmö University.
3. **Hypotheses:**
   - The current economic and social challenges have resulted in a crisis of public sector organizations' ability to provide public services effectively.
   - Social innovations and people's collaborative attitudes can drive changes in public services.
   - Design-led innovation and practices hold disruptive potential for public sector organizations.
4. **Activities (2012-2013):**
   - Connecting and comparing ongoing research activities.
   - Sharing pedagogical tools and resources.
   - Promoting public lectures.
5. **Outcomes:**
   - Initial outcomes presented in this booklet, including reviewed and updated versions of papers discussed in Liège, Belgium, in October 2012.

Each author provides specific recommendations for designers, educators, civil servants, and policymakers based on their experiences.
