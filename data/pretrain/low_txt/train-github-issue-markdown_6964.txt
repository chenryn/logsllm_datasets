The `util` node module employs the `Object.create` method within its `inherit` function. However, in Internet Explorer 8 and earlier versions, `Object.create` is not defined. To ensure that `util` functions correctly in these browsers, a shim is required.

While not all features of `Object.create` available in JavaScript 1.8.5 can be fully emulated, the shim provided by MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) should suffice for the purposes of the `inherit` function.
