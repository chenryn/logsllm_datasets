### Unresolvable and Malicious IDNs

Our analysis revealed that 55% of Type-1 IDNs are unresolvable, 9% result in errors, 21% are parked, and 2% are empty. This suggests that most Type-1 IDNs are owned by opportunistic registrants. We also identified two domains (xn--bet365-n82p.com and xn--bet365-g37i416dc3e.com) that impersonate bet365.com and are involved in malware delivery.

### Summary of Findings

Exploiting the semantics of brand domains, attackers can create deceptive IDNs for malicious activities such as phishing. Although such attacks have not been widely reported, our detector has already identified 1,497 potentially malicious IDNs. While a few of these domains have been used for malicious activities, most remain inactive or in "sleep mode."

### Discussion

#### Recommendations

Our research has identified at least 6,241 malicious IDNs, some of which are actively being used and are highly deceptive to users. To address the issues surrounding IDN abuse, collaborative efforts from all stakeholders in the Internet ecosystem are necessary:

- **Registries**: Registries maintaining DNS zones should implement checks to ensure domain registration requests are not intended for malicious purposes. For example, a brand protection system deployed on three TLDs (e.g., .cn) performs resemblance checks on visual appearance, pronunciation, and semantics.
- **Registrars**: Registrars should avoid domain parking for abusive IDNs, which can reduce attackers' revenue from domain name fraud.
- **Browsers**: Our analysis of off-the-shelf browsers indicates that not all browser vendors correctly implement IETF guidelines. We recommend prompt code patches. Additionally, policies based on character set diversity are insufficient. Internet Explorer 11, for instance, alerts users when a domain name contains Unicode characters.
- **End Users**: Education is essential to help users understand the risks and to carefully check for indicators of deception.

### Related Work

#### Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)

Although IDN implementation has been in place for over a decade, there are only a few studies on this topic and its security implications. The homograph attack caused by IDNs has received the most attention from the security community. The first research on this issue was conducted by Tobias et al. in 2006, who analyzed a small amount of user network traffic to find IDNs impersonating Alexa's top 500 sites and measured their popularity and intent. Hannay et al. showed that homograph attacks were gaining traction among cybercriminals. Chris Larsen explored various ways IDNs are abused, including for malware distribution and botnet communications.

Our study is more comprehensive in terms of scale, observations, and identified attack vectors. By scanning zone files from major TLDs and iTLDs, we discovered over 1.4 million IDNs, significantly more than previous studies. We measured the entire IDN ecosystem, including hosting, registration, and usage. In addition to homograph attacks, our study uncovered new semantic attacks launched through IDNs.

#### Domain-Squatting

IDN attacks aim to confuse web users in recognizing domain names, hoping to hijack their web traffic, which can be classified as domain-squatting attacks. Previous studies have revealed different forms of such attacks, such as typo-squatting. Recent studies even show that configuration issues and hardware errors in users' machines can be exploited by attackers to harvest domain requests, known as bitsquatting. The semantic attack discovered in our research complements existing work in this area and suggests that the attack vectors in this category are not yet exhausted. While most reputable domains are targeted by this attack vector, the overall negative externalities for Internet users remain moderate.

#### DNS Abuse

DNS has long been abused by attackers to cover their infrastructures. They obtain domain names from registrars and link them to a wide range of cyber-criminal activities, such as blackhat SEO, malware, and spam. The research community has devoted significant effort to detecting such malicious domains, primarily through DNS analysis, URL analysis, and code analysis. Many studies focus on understanding the operational models behind these domains and how to protect DNS against abuse.

### Conclusion

To make the Internet more accessible to non-English speakers, the IETF initiated the IDN standard, and many registrars have opened up registration for IDNs. Our quantitative analysis shows that the number of IDNs has steadily grown over the years, with over 1.4 million IDNs now registered. However, their value to Internet users is far below expectations. Through stratified sampling analysis, we found that only 19.8% of IDNs deliver meaningful content, compared to 33.6% of ASCII domains. Moreover, visits to IDNs are far less frequent than non-IDNs under gTLDs like .com. 

What makes IDNs more problematic is that they enable new attack vectors, such as brand phishing. We discovered 1,516 IDNs resembling known brands, with at least 100 confirmed as malicious. There is a large pool of deceptive IDNs, with 42,671 IDNs capable of homograph attacks, most of which are unregistered. Additionally, IDNs can be designed to confuse users by padding keywords or translating English brand names, a phenomenon we call semantic attack. We discovered 1,497 IDNs using this method, with some brands (like 58.com) targeted by over 100 IDNs. We believe that the development of IDNs needs rectification, and all entities in the Internet, including registries, registrars, and Internet software providers, should contribute to this effort.
