### CAN-FD and Its Relevance

The introduction of CAN-FD (Controller Area Network with Flexible Data-Rate) in 2012 addresses the bandwidth limitations of traditional CAN. CAN-FD supports a higher data rate of up to 2.5 Mbit/s in the automotive sector [22] and allows payloads ranging from 8 to 64 bytes per message. This enhanced capability makes EASI (Enhanced Automotive Security Identification) relevant for various applications, including those that require increased bandwidth. Since the fundamental functionality of CAN remains unchanged, the proposed approach is also suitable for the next generation of CAN-based systems. The increased payload size results in more rising edges, which can be leveraged to reduce the sampling rate.

### Conclusion

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a promising technology for enhancing security in connected vehicles. The lack of sender identification in the widely used CAN bus system means that IDSs do not have access to crucial information about the source of messages. Even the evolution to CAN-FD, which will be introduced in the next generation of vehicles, does not address this issue. Therefore, the benefits of sender identification apply equally to both CAN and CAN-FD.

CAN is not limited to the automotive sector; it is also used in other fields such as automation, medical devices, and rail transport. The approach presented in this paper enables sender identification by analyzing differences in signal characteristics caused by hardware variations. Evaluation using a prototype and two production vehicles demonstrated that over 99.9% sender identification accuracy is achievable even with resource-constrained hardware. This is the first time that comprehensive signal characteristic-based classification has been shown to be feasible at low cost while meeting real-time requirements. This was achieved through significant simplifications of individual phases, reduced sampling rates, and minimal data processing.

Moreover, we were able to further enhance identification rates by focusing on the most informative signal characteristics. We also specified an update mechanism and demonstrated through simulations that it can adapt the model to potential changes. In addition to detecting attacks from compromised ECUs, the presented IDS can identify intrusions by unmonitored and additional ECUs. The system's robustness against attackers who can manipulate the voltage levels of compromised ECUs and the vehicle's energy supply was also demonstrated. A one-week test drive under varying conditions and active consumers confirmed the system's reliability.

Given that an attacker can control all vehicle functions once they gain access to internal communication, the approach presented here offers substantial potential for increasing the security and safety of connected vehicles. Overall, EASI is the first sender identification method that exploits comprehensive signal characteristics, enabling its implementation on a realistic automotive platform.
