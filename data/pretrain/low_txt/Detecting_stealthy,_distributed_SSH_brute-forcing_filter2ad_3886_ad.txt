### Analysis
The study of failing to authenticate is well-described using a beta-binomial distribution. This model allows us to tune the detector to balance an expected level of false positives against time-to-detection.

Using this detector, we studied the prevalence of distributed brute-forcing, which occurs frequently. For eight years of data collected at a US National Lab, we identified 35 attack campaigns that would have evaded detection by a pointwise host detector. Many of these campaigns targeted a wide range of machines and could have been detected using a detector with a site-wide view. However, we also found instances of stealthy attacks that were very difficult to detect except in aggregate.

We correlated attacks found at the site with data from other sites and found many appeared simultaneously at multiple sites, indicating indiscriminate global probing. However, some attacks lacked such global corroboration and clearly targeted only the local site. Some campaigns showed extensive persistence, lasting multiple months. Finally, we found that such detection can have significant positive benefits, as users sometimes choose weak passwords, enabling brute-forcers to occasionally succeed.
