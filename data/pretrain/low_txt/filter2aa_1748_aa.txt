## Chapter 1: Introduction to Java Application Server Administration

JBoss is a powerful, open-source Java-based application server widely used by Java 2, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) application developers. This document provides detailed instructions on configuring and using the JBoss application server in Mac OS X Server, enabling easy and reliable deployment of J2EE applications.

### Target Audience
This document is intended for system administrators, J2EE application assemblers, and developers. It assumes a solid background in system administration and J2EE technology. Familiarity with Mac OS X Server, especially using Terminal to issue shell commands, is required. Knowledge of database engines like MySQL is helpful but not mandatory.

### Document Structure
- **Chapter 2: Application Server Overview** - Provides an overview of JBoss for Mac OS X Server.
- **Chapter 3: Configuring Applications** - Explains how to perform tasks with the deployment tool, such as opening, configuring, and saving application archives.
- **Chapter 4: Configuring and Deploying Sun’s Pet Store** - Walks through configuring and deploying Sun’s Pet Store application in Mac OS X Server.
- **Chapter 5: Administering Application Servers** - Teaches how to manage JBoss instances running on one or more computers.
- **Chapter 6: Balancing User Load and Replicating Sessions** - Explains how to enable an application to be distributable among cluster nodes and configure HTTP load balancing for Pet Store using three computers.

## Chapter 2: Application Server Overview

JBoss is a popular, open-source Java-based application server based on the J2EE platform. It provides an affordable delivery system for enterprise applications. Applications that follow the J2EE standard can be deployed on other application servers, such as WebLogic, WebSphere, and JRun, with little or no modification. JBoss offers additional features beyond the J2EE standard, including support for clustering, session replication, mail, and security.

Mac OS X Server includes two easy-to-use, HTML-based tools for configuring J2EE applications:
- **Deployment Tool**: Allows you to open and configure application or component archives (EAR, WAR, JAR, SAR, etc.).
- **Management Tool**: Facilitates the management and monitoring of JBoss instances.
