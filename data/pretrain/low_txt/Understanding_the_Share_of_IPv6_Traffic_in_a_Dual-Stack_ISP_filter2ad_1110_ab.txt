### Network Data Collection and Processing

During the winter of 2015-2016, we implemented a custom tool built on top of the libtrace library [9] to process raw network data into two streams. The first stream consists of packet summaries, including packet size, source (SRC) and destination (DST) IP addresses, and port numbers. For TCP packets, we also save TCP flags, sequence (SEQ), and acknowledgment (ACK) numbers. The second stream captures full-sized DNS traffic packets (UDP port 53).

We then processed these packet summaries to obtain flow-level statistics by aggregating them into 5-tuples and expiring inactive flows after 3600 seconds. For TCP flows, we computed the time difference between the SYN and SYN-ACK packets to estimate TCP handshake times. Given our monitor's location within the aggregation network, these handshakes only capture wide-area delays (backbone RTTs) and do not include delays from the access- and home networks (see [33] for details). The dataset was collected, processed, and analyzed in an isolated and secured segment of the ISP's infrastructure. The toolset operates in an automated fashion, anonymizing line IDs and addresses before writing the annotated flows to disk. Table 1 summarizes the dataset collected for this study.

### DNS Transactions

We processed 141.9 million DNS transactions, where each transaction is defined as an A or AAAA request with a valid response. 69.6% of these entries were of type A, and 30.4% were of type AAAA. Among these DNS transactions, 0.6% of A requests and 36.0% of AAAA requests could not be resolved (empty response). The high ratio of unresolved AAAA requests is due to content that is requested for IPv6 but is still not accessible over IPv6 (see Section 2). 39% of the A requests were sent over IPv6, and 28% of the AAAA requests were sent over IPv4.

### Flow-Level Statistics

Table 1 provides a breakdown of the contribution of TCP and UDP traffic, dissected by IP version. Unsurprisingly, TCPv4 dominates in terms of traffic volume. However, the share of IPv6 is substantial (11.9%), especially when compared to older measurement studies at other vantage points [19, 46]. Web traffic accounts for 86.6% of the trace volume (13.5% over IPv6). We find that QUIC contributes 2.8% of the overall trace volume (39.5% over IPv6). When considering the relative UDP contributions over IPv4 and IPv6, the share of UDPv6 flows is well above the UDPv4 share. This bias is primarily introduced by DNS traffic: DNS accounts for 71.0% of all UDP flows, and 75.3% of DNS flows are sent over IPv6.

### Classification Coverage

We were able to associate up to 76.1% of the traffic with services using the flow-classification approach described in Section 3.2. While our coverage statistics are consistent with the base results reported in [35], they are lower than related methods because our method (i) does not use a warm-up period to account for already cached DNS RRs, (ii) relies on each subscriber’s own DNS traffic, and (iii) adheres to the TTL values included in DNS responses.

### A Dual-Stack ISP Perspective on IPv6 Traffic

#### 5.1 The Subscribers’ Side

We identified three classes of DSLs among the 12,900 subscriber lines:
- **IPv4-only:** Lines without IPv6 connectivity from the ISP (17.3%).
- **IPv6-inactive:** Lines provisioned with IPv6 connectivity but no IPv6 traffic (29.9%).
- **IPv6-active:** Lines with both IPv6 connectivity and IPv6 traffic (52.9%).

**IPv4-only Subscribers:**
These lines correspond to subscribers for whom the ISP has not yet activated IPv6 connectivity (e.g., old contracts). They contribute 12.0% to the overall trace volume. 26.6% of their traffic is exchanged with services available over IPv6. Some devices issue AAAA DNS requests, likely because some CPEs create a link-local IPv6 network. For 11.6% of the traffic related to IPv6 services, we observe a AAAA request. This indicates that many devices are prepared to use IPv6 connectivity, awaiting the ISP to take action.

**IPv6-inactive Subscribers:**
For 36.1% of the DSLs, we do not observe any IPv6 traffic, even though the ISP assigned IPv6 prefixes to the CPEs. One explanation is that the CPE has not been configured to enable IPv6 on the home network. Thus, the ISP provides IPv6 connectivity, but the end-devices only have internal IPv4 addresses (e.g., RFC1918) assigned from the CPE. Consequently, only 1.7% of the traffic from these subscribers can be associated with a AAAA request, likely because most devices suppress AAAA requests in the absence of a link-local IPv6 address. Other less likely explanations include devices not supporting IPv6 (e.g., Windows XP) or subscribers not contacting services available over IPv6. The latter is unlikely, as 24.1% of the traffic in this subscriber class is exchanged with IPv6-ready services.

**IPv6-active Subscribers:**
Subscribers in this category actively use the provided IPv6 connectivity. The share of IPv6 traffic for these subscribers is almost twice as high (21.5%) compared to the overall trace (11.9%). When only considering traffic exchanged between IPv6-active subscribers and services available over IPv6, the ratio is even higher (69.6%). However, 30% of the traffic exchanged between two IPv6-enabled hosts is carried over IPv4. This can be caused by end-user devices not requesting content over IPv6 (no AAAA RR) or choosing IPv4 over IPv6 due to happy eyeball implementation. When only considering traffic for which the client requested both IPv4 and IPv6 (A and AAAA), the share of IPv6 in this category rises to 85.1%. This implies that enabling IPv6 can rapidly increase the share of IPv6 traffic in dual-stack networks.

#### 5.2 The Service Providers’ Side

We next shift our focus from subscribers to services (FQDNs). We define three categories:
- **IPv4-only:** Services with only a valid non-empty A RR.
- **IPv6-only:** Services with only a valid non-empty AAAA RR.
- **IPv6-ready:** Services with valid and non-empty A and AAAA RRs.

**IPv4-only Services (only A RR):**
This set of services dominates the traffic share (47.9%). However, for 36.2% of this traffic, we observe a preceding AAAA request from the subscriber, indicating potential for serving this traffic over IPv6 if service providers enable IPv6.

**IPv6-only Services (only AAAA RR):**
We found around 500 services available only over IPv6, accounting for less than 0.1% of the traffic. Manual inspection reveals that most of them are connectivity checkers. Some service providers add strings to host names, which may appear as IPv6-only services (e.g., both `host.domain.org` and `hostv6.domain.org` have a AAAA RR, but only the former has an A RR).

**IPv6-ready Services (A and AAAA RRs):**
These services generate a significant amount of traffic (27.8%). However, since many subscribers in this dual-stack network cannot use IPv6, the actual share of IPv6 traffic within this class of services is only 38.6%.

### Barriers and Intent for IPv6 Traffic

As shown in Table 2, the upper bounds for IPv6 traffic share when looking at services and subscribers independently are roughly 2 and 4 times the actual IPv6 traffic share, respectively. Not all traffic in the cross-product of IPv6-active subscribers and IPv6-ready services is carried over IPv6. We next study the root causes leading to this lower-than-possible IPv6 share.

**IPv6 Barriers:**
Figure 2(a) illustrates why traffic related to IPv6-ready services is exchanged over IPv4. The top bar shows all traffic in the trace according to service availability. 27.8% of the traffic relates to services available over IPv6, but 61.4% of it is actually exchanged over IPv4 (middle bar). The bottom bar explains why data is exchanged over IPv4 instead of IPv6. Most of this traffic (70.5%) is carried over IPv4 because the subscribers do not use IPv6 connectivity at all (IPv4-only and IPv6-inactive). For the remaining traffic (generated by IPv6-active subscribers), the majority has no associated AAAA request, attributed to end-devices that do not support IPv6. For another 40% of the IPv4 traffic from IPv6-active subscribers to IPv6-ready services, we observe a AAAA request, likely due to the happy-eyeballs algorithm.

**IPv6 Intent:**
Figure 2(b) illustrates what fraction of the traffic of IPv4-only services (top bar) could be carried over IPv6. The middle bar depicts how much of this traffic is exchanged with each subscriber category, while the bottom bar shows the traffic characteristics for the IPv6-active subscribers. Specifically, we observe that end-user devices in the IPv6-active group issue AAAA requests, indicating an intent to use IPv6.
