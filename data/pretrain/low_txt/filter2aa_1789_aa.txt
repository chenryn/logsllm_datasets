# The World of Pager Sniffing and Interception

## Introduction
**Title: The World of Pager Sniffing and Interception: More Activity than One May Suspect.**

**Music:** The Cool Kids – "Gold and a Pager"
- **Note:** Play the music as attendees enter the room, then transition to the next slide.

### Context
Pager interception was once well-documented and widely practiced within certain groups. While I am not a trailblazer in this field, it is important to recognize that old technology is not necessarily bad technology. It is dated but still usable and interesting. This presentation aims to reintroduce pager interception with new ideas that may not have been available in the early to mid-1990s.

**Key Point:** Old tech is not bad tech; it is tried and tested.

## Inspirational Quotes
1. **"Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."**
   - Ralph Waldo Emerson

2. **"Everything that was or ever is began with a dream."**
   - Lava Girl

### Reflections on the Quotes
- **Quote 1:** Pager interception has been done before, but the challenge is to find new paths. Things evolve over time, and the opportunity to reinvent, rethink, and retool is open to all. Amateur SIGINT (radio monitoring) is an exciting and rewarding hobby.
- **Quote 2:** Don’t be afraid to think outside the box. Sometimes, unconventional ideas just work.

## Pagers: A Quick Look
### Are You Serious? It's Not 1993!
- **Common Misconception:** Pagers are outdated.
- **Reality:** Pagers are still used in various sectors:
  - IBM, DOC, FWD e-mails
  - SANDIA, Los Alamos Labs
  - DHS, Sports updating
  - DOT, Hospitals (patient details)
  - BOP, Teleconferences
  - And many more...

### Why Pagers?
- **Cost:** No longer a factor.
- **Signal Penetration and Strength:** Pagers often have better signal penetration and strength, filling gaps or "shadows."
- **Entertainment Value:** Once set up, you can enjoy hours of interesting traffic.
- **Useful Data:** Examples include telephone conference calls, sensitive messages, and personal information.

## Learning Objectives
### Refreshing on Pager Technology
- **Cap Codes, Protocols (POCSAG, Flex, Golay, Ermes)**
- **Laws Governing Interception and Decoding of Pager Traffic**
- **Data Slicers and Discriminator Taps**

### Basic SIGINT
- **Disciplines and Usage:**
  - Targeting
  - Coordinated Receivers
  - Signal Detection
  - Traffic Analysis

### Key Questions
- **How do pagers work?**
  - RF (Radio Frequency), message transmission via satellites and cell towers.
  - Common protocols: POCSAG and Flex.
- **CapCodes?**
  - Unique IDs; the unit activates only when it hears its ID/CapCode over the air.
- **Data Slicers?**
  - Convert analog and digital (FSK) signals.
- **Discriminator Tap?**
  - Baseband audio.
- **Is it illegal?**
  - Not always, but be responsible with the knowledge you gain.

## Pager Refresher
### The Rise and Fall
- **Rise/Fall:**
  - Cost and capabilities of cell phones have reduced pager usage.
- **Uses:**
  - Professional and personal communication.
- **US Protocols:**
  - POCSAG, FLEX

## Setting Up the Station
### Antennas
- **Receiving Range:**
  - 25-1300MHz for VHF and UHF signals.
- **Pre-Amp:**
  - Optional, but useful for other signal types.
- **Placement:**
  - Higher placement is ideal, but community restrictions may apply.

### Cables
- **Types:**
  - 1/8 inch, RG-58/59/8, RS 232 DB 9
- **Coaxial Cables:**
  - 50 ohm vs. 75 ohm
- **Source:**
  - www.allelectronics.com

### Decoding Software
- **Options:**
  - Windows: PDW, POC32, Radioraft
  - Linux: Multimon
  - DOS: Various options
- **Recommendation:**
  - Sample different applications to find what works best for you.

### Radios
- **PC Controlled vs. Non-PC Controlled:**
  - PC controlled: Remote operation
  - Non-PC: Lower cost
- **Choosing the Right Fit:**
  - **Cost:** Budget-friendly options like Pro-84 or BD 855 XLT.
  - **Mobility:** Consider your needs.
  - **Ease of Use:** Not all models are plug-and-play; choose based on your skill level.
