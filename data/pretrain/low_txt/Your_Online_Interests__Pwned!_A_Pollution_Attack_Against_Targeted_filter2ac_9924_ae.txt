### Ad Exchange and Re-marketing Script Security

Ad exchanges, such as DoubleClick, do not verify the domain in which re-marketing scripts are executed. This allows malicious actors to simply copy the JavaScript provided by the ad exchange and use it on any domain. To mitigate this, the re-marketing script should be bound to a specific domain, and at runtime, the script should check that it is running within the intended domain.

### User Control and Transparency

Some ad exchanges and networks provide users with the ability to inspect and modify their inferred online interest profiles or opt out of personalized ads [4, 5, 7, 13, 14]. However, users have limited visibility into how these profiles are generated or used to serve targeted ads [29]. Ad exchanges and networks should offer easy mechanisms for users to flag suspicious ads that do not align with their real interests. Additionally, users should be encouraged to manually adjust their online interests and explicitly exclude certain categories. For example, a user might want to disallow all health-related ads. In such cases, attempts by malicious actors to influence the user's profile with the health category would result in no ads from this category being targeted at the user.

### Impact of Immediate Profile Updates

A key factor in the success of these attacks is the immediate impact of pollution content on the user profile, allowing the attacker to benefit almost immediately. Ad networks can mitigate this by increasing the time between page visits and the impact on the user's profile. This delay can help by profiling users' interests across a larger set of websites they visit. However, this approach may conflict with the ad networks' need for accurate and timely inference of user interests, especially for re-marketing campaigns.

#### Online Advertising Economy and Tracking

The economics of online advertising, including the use of targeting based on user interests, is discussed in detail in [23]. Gill et al. [25] proposed a model to capture the effect of user profiles (or "intent") on the revenue of ad networks and publishers. They showed that blocking tracking, which eliminates targeted advertising, can decrease overall ad network revenue by 75%.

To build accurate user profiles, ad networks must track users as they browse the web. Several studies have measured the extent of user tracking and targeting by ad networks [29, 30, 33]. Rosner et al. [33] found that online tracking is widespread and covers a large fraction of user browsing behavior. Liu et al. [29] focused on Google's DoubleClick network and showed that interest-based targeting is prominent, with up to 65% of ad categories received by users being based on their inferred profiles.

In our work, we leverage the strong relationship between user interest profiles and the economics of online advertising to propose a method for polluting user interest profiles to increase publisher revenue.

#### Pollution Attacks

Pollution attacks have been shown to be effective in various contexts, such as influencing product recommendations on Amazon and video recommendations on YouTube [39]. While these attacks can influence user interactions with the polluted system, it is unclear whether the attacker can gain monetary benefits. Our work is the first to demonstrate a pollution attack that results in clear monetary value for the attacker.

#### Fraud in Online Advertising

Fraud in online advertising and countermeasures against it have been extensively studied [8, 16, 17, 20, 21, 31, 35–38]. Common fraudulent activities include click-spam networks and pay-per-view networks, which increase traffic to fraudulent publishers' sites to boost ad revenue. Click-spam networks generate fraudulent clicks to increase publisher income or deplete advertiser budgets. A recent study [21] found that click-spam accounts for 10-25% of clicks.

Pay-per-view networks artificially increase the number of ad impressions by framing the publisher's website within other websites in a camouflaged manner. These activities typically result in invalid traffic generation. A recent study [35] showed that a pay-per-view network can generate hundreds of millions of fraudulent impressions per day.

Existing online advertising frauds focus on increasing the volume of ad clicks or impressions but largely ignore the impact of user profiles. Our attack complements these existing mechanisms by enabling publishers to further boost revenue through participation in either type of network. Compared to existing fraudulent activities, which are susceptible to traffic analysis [35, 40], our attack is more resilient to current fraud detection methods.

### Conclusion

This paper introduces a new pollution attack on online targeted advertising that exploits the role of user interest profiles in the ad selection process. The attack uses novel mechanisms to pollute the profiles of users visiting a publisher's page, deceiving the ad exchange and advertisers to target more lucrative ads, thereby increasing the publisher's revenue. The proposed attack is validated and characterized for the two most common ad targeting mechanisms (re-marketing and behavioral targeting) through a real-world deployment. The study shows that the profile pollution attack is robust against diverse browsing patterns and online interests of users and is effective in drawing higher-paying ads, resulting in a significant increase in ad revenue.
