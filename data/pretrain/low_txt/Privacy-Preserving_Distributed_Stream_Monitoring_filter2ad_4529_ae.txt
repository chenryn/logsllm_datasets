### Varying Number of Violation Rounds and System Lifetime

The bound \( b \) on the number of violation rounds has two opposing effects on the system's lifetime. Increasing this bound allows the system to tolerate more local breaches (and the resulting synchronization rounds) before the privacy budget is exhausted. However, a higher bound also means that the privacy budget allocated for monitoring each sequence of silent rounds ending with a violation round will be smaller. This, in turn, introduces more noise into the monitoring process, increasing the likelihood and frequency of violation rounds.

Figures 16 and 17 illustrate the impact of different bounds on the number of violation rounds when monitoring the number of spam messages with thresholds \( T = 4800 \) and \( T = 5000 \), respectively. Similarly, Figure 18 shows the effect when monitoring the information gain of the "febru" feature with a threshold \( T = 0.002 \). The opposing effects of the number of violation rounds are evident in the decrease in system lifetime when the number of violation rounds is either too low or too high. The system lifetime peaks at a "sweet spot" where these opposing effects are balanced. Furthermore, when privacy constraints are weaker (i.e., \( \epsilon \) is higher), it is possible to sustain more violation rounds without a significant increase in false positives, leading to a longer system lifetime.

### Discussion and Future Work

In this paper, we demonstrated how communication-efficient distributed monitoring algorithms can be leveraged for privacy-preserving monitoring of a global condition over long periods. We provided theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm and experimentally evaluated the trade-offs between privacy constraints, system lifetime, and monitored thresholds. Beyond these direct trade-offs, we studied additional factors affecting the balance between privacy and system performance, such as error margins augmenting the monitored threshold and the bound on the number of violation rounds.

For future research, more sophisticated methods for violation recovery, such as local communication between nodes rather than global synchronization, could further mitigate privacy loss while monitoring the system. Prediction models that tailor safe zones to individual nodes [34], [35] also show promise in reducing the probability of local safe zone breaches, allowing for further increases in system lifetime. Additionally, once the window of processed elements advances beyond those contributing to violation rounds, the privacy loss from those rounds can be discounted. This opens the possibility of replenishing the violation round limit, extending the system lifetime within the given privacy constraint.
