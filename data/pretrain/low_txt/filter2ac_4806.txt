**Title: Botconf 2017 - The Wannacry Investigation: Unveiling the Initial Attack Vector**

On May 12, 2017, a highly virulent strain of ransomware known as Wannacry infected hundreds of thousands of computers, impacting organizations worldwide. While it is well-documented that Wannacry propagated using the EternalBlue exploit, there was limited information available about the initial attack vector. Tracing an attacker's activities back to their origin can provide critical insights into their methods and potential vulnerabilities. This proved to be the case with the first version of Wannacry (WannaCry 1.0).

In this presentation, we will walk through Symantecâ€™s comprehensive investigation into Wannacry. Our research uncovered links to previously identified malware families and tools used in the 2014 cyber-attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. These findings were instrumental in identifying the perpetrators behind the Wannacry attack.

By delving into the details of our investigation, we aim to shed light on the techniques and tactics employed by the attackers, and how these connections led us to uncover their identity.
