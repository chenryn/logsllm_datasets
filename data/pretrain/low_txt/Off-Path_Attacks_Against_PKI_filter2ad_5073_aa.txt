### Abstract

The security of Internet-based applications fundamentally relies on the trustworthiness of Certificate Authorities (CAs). We demonstrate, for the first time, that even a weak attacker, specifically an off-path attacker, can effectively subvert the trustworthiness of popular commercially used CAs. Our attack targets a CA that uses Domain Validation (DV) for authenticating domain ownership. By exploiting DNS Cache Poisoning, we trick the CA into issuing fraudulent certificates for domains the attacker does not legitimately own, binding the attacker’s public key to a victim domain.

### 1. Introduction

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a fundamental mechanism that facilitates Internet security and bootstraps cryptographic mechanisms. It provides procedures and technology for creating and managing digital certificates, which bind entities such as digital resources to cryptographic keys. These keys are used to establish security, including authentication and encryption, with Internet destinations.

Over the years, various PKI models have been proposed, designed, and standardized. The main difference between these models lies in the types of entities that can be certified, including clients, devices, and digital resources. A common challenge across all PKIs is the authentication of the entity to be certified.

In this work, we focus on the most widely deployed and used PKI on the Internet: the web PKI, which certifies ownership over domain names. We explore the security of the authentication techniques used by popular CAs to establish domain name ownership during the certificate issuance process. Correctly establishing domain ownership is critical for ensuring that services are trusted and communication with them is secure.

Ultimately, CAs vouch for the trustworthiness of a service by issuing a digital certificate that binds a domain name to the public key of the service. The certificate contains, among other things, the public key of the requesting server and the requested domain. The domain name within the certificate is a key element on which trust is built. The certificate is signed by the private key of the CA. The server then uses this certificate to prove its identity to clients on the Internet, who use the key in the certificate to establish a secure (encrypted and authenticated) connection to the server.

To validate that the server issuing the request owns and controls the domain for which it requests the certificate, most CAs use Domain Validation (DV). DV allows automated proof that the applicant owns a given domain name. The idea behind DV is that only the owner of the domain can receive and respond to communications sent to services within that domain.

In this work, we build on the attack presented in [1] and prepare a real-life demonstration against a popular and widely used CA with a victim domain controlled by us. Our demo is the first to weaponize DNS cache poisoning by off-path attackers in practice and to demonstrate it against a critical system like the web PKI. Prior to our work, off-path DNS cache poisoning was considered a theoretical threat.

Our demo shows that although PKI is supposed to provide security against strong Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attackers, the widely supported DV mechanism, which underlies the security of certificates issued within the PKI, is vulnerable to even weak off-path attackers. We show that off-path attackers can trick the DV process and issue fraudulent certificates for domains they do not own.

Our attack uses DNS cache poisoning to inject incorrect mappings into the caches of CAs. These mappings redirect the target domain to IP addresses controlled by the attacker. As a result, the CAs perform the DV process against attacker-controlled hosts rather than the real domain owner. We show how to overcome all challenges with an off-path attacker during the certificate issuance. Our results demonstrate that the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which is meant to provide security against strong MitM attackers, relies on a weak building block that can be circumvented by an off-path attacker.

### 2. Weaponizing Cache Poisoning to Subvert DV

In this section, we demonstrate an off-path attack that allows an attacker to impersonate a victim domain to a CA and cause the CA to issue a fraudulent certificate binding the attacker's public key to the victim domain. Our demonstration is based on the attack presented in [1] and describes the technical and practical challenges.

The attack leverages off-path DNS cache poisoning against the DNS resolver of the CA. During the attack, we inject a spoofed DNS record mapping the victim domain to attacker-controlled hosts, so that the DV checks performed by the CA are directed to the attacker's hosts.

For our demo, we set up a victim domain at `victim-org.info`. We will inject spoofed records redirecting a nameserver and email server in this domain to IP addresses controlled by the attacker. The attack is initiated with a DNS request, which the CA should send to the victim. The attacker then injects a DNS response with malicious records from a spoofed IP address (impersonating a victim nameserver). If the CA's cache does not have the records of the victim domain, injecting the DNS records is straightforward. Often, the victim's records are present in the cache, and in this case, the cached records need to be overwritten with new values supplied by the attacker. We present demonstrations of both scenarios (when the target records are cached and when they are not).

#### 2.1 DNS Request

To prevent attacks against DNS resolvers, networks are configured to block external requests from the Internet and serve only requests originated by internal clients or services. Since the off-path attacker is not on the same network as the attacked CA, we need to use alternative techniques to initiate communication with the CA's DNS resolver.

We trigger DNS requests by utilizing the CSR (Certificate Signing Request) uploading form. This causes the CA to initiate a DV process, which triggers DNS requests for the domain provided in the CSR—the target domain.

The attack is initiated with a DNS request. To succeed, the attacker must craft a correct DNS response before the authentic response from the real nameserver arrives.
