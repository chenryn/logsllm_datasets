## Abstract
Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) is a notoriously unreliable metric for predicting the performance of wireless links due to various factors. This unreliability complicates network operations, as it necessitates extensive testing and adaptation to optimize parameters such as transmission rate and power. In this paper, we present a novel method that accurately predicts packet delivery for commodity 802.11 NICs using only the channel measurements they provide. Our model leverages 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI) and an OFDM receiver model based on the concept of effective SNR. The model is simple, easy to deploy, broadly applicable, and highly accurate. It can predict packet delivery for 802.11a/g SISO rates and 802.11n MIMO rates, as well as for different transmit power and antenna configurations.

Our experimental results show that the transition regions for packet delivery are narrow (typically within 7 dB for 90% of the links). A key factor in this improvement is the use of effective SNR to capture frequency-selective fading, which is clearly observable in our testbeds. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has explored the use of effective SNR measures in 802.11 beyond simulations. Our model does not account for interference, but our measurements indicate that its estimate of interference-free link quality remains robust even in the presence of interfering transmissions. We also discuss methods to handle persistent interference.

Our approach is practical and can be applied to various classic problems, including rate adaptation, transmit power tuning, and channel and antenna selection. We demonstrate how our model can inform rate adaptation and present a rate selection algorithm that performs as well as the best 802.11a/g rate adaptation algorithms and extends this performance to 802.11n. Our algorithm uses the model to predict the highest rate for the channel and tracks the channel over time. We compare it with widely used algorithms like SampleRate and SoftRate through trace-driven simulations and show that it tracks the best rate nearly as well as possible, even for dynamic mobile channels. It performs exceptionally well for MIMO rates and supports enhancements such as transmit power trimming and antenna selection.

To the best of our knowledge, no other reported work on 802.11n rate adaptation has been evaluated on real 802.11 channels, and no other rate adaptation algorithms support these enhancements. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 motivates the need for better delivery predictions, Section 3 presents our model, Section 4 describes our experimental testbeds, and Section 5 evaluates our model. Section 6 uses simulation to study rate selection guided by our model, Section 7 discusses related work, and Section 8 concludes the paper.

## 2. Motivation

Existing methods for predicting packet delivery for a given link rely on the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) value, which is commonly used as a proxy for the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). However, RSSI is known to be an unreliable indicator. To motivate our research, we characterize the relationship between RSSI and packet delivery.

### 802.11 Setting
Our work applies to 802.11a/g/n radios that use coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). These radios operate on 20 or 40 MHz channels, which are divided into 312.5 kHz subcarriers. Each subcarrier sends independent data simultaneously, and convolutional coding and bit interleaving are used for error correction. The data rates depend on the combination of modulation and coding. Our experimental platform uses 802.11n radios operating on 20 MHz channels, and the single-stream 802.11n rates are shown in Table 1. The main innovation in 802.11n is the use of multiple antennas for spatial multiplexing, allowing multiple streams to be sent simultaneously for higher overall rates.

### Packet Delivery versus RSSI/SNR
Textbook analyses of modulation schemes provide the delivery probability for a single signal in terms of the SNR, typically expressed in decibels. This model holds for narrowband channels with additive white Gaussian noise and predicts a sharp transition region of 1â€“2 dB over which a link changes from extremely lossy to highly reliable. This makes SNR a valuable indicator of performance.

RSSI values reported by Network Interface Cards (NICs) give an estimate of the total signal power for each received packet. From RSSI, the packet SNR can be computed using NIC noise measurements. We generated performance curves using SNR for a real 802.11n NIC over a simple wired link with a variable attenuator and for a single transmit and receive antenna. The results for all single-antenna 802.11n rates are shown in Figure 1(a), where we observe a characteristic sharp transition region for packet reception rate (PRR) versus SNR. This behavior is desirable for a link metric to predict packet delivery.

In contrast, packet delivery over real wireless channels does not exhibit the same clear picture. Figure 1(b) shows the measured PRR versus SNR for three sample rates (6.5, 26, and 65 Mbps) over all wireless links in our testbeds, using the same 802.11n NICs. The SNR of the transition regions can exceed 10 dB, meaning that some links work well at a given SNR while others do not. There is no longer a clear separation between rates, which is consistent with other reported studies.

**Figure 1:**
- **(a)** A wired 802.11n link with variable attenuation shows a predictable relationship between SNR and PRR, with clear separation between rates.
- **(b)** Over real wireless channels in our testbeds, the transition regions for PRR versus SNR are much wider, with no clear separation between rates.
