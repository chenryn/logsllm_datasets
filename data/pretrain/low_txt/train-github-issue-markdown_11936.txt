### Environment Details
- Dubbo Version: 2.7.1
- Operating System: macOS
- Java Version: 1.8

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue
I am currently using the latest versions of Dubbo and Nacos. However, when I attempt to register a service with Nacos, it only appears in the `[public]` namespace, even when I explicitly specify a different namespace name.

### Question
Does Dubbo support the use of custom namespaces as defined by Nacos (version 0.8.0 and above)? 

### Additional Information
Nacos version 0.8.0 and later have introduced support for namespace parameters. 

Thank you for your assistance.
