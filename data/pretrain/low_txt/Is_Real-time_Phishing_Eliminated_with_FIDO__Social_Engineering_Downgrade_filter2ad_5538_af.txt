### Employee Onboarding Information

**Welcome to NanoTech!**  
We’re excited to have you join our team. At NanoTech, we are committed to protecting the company, our employees, and our customers' resources, internal and external networks, and sensitive data.

**Our Goals:**
- Safeguard NanoTech's confidential information, employee information, and our customers' confidential information.
- Ensure uninterrupted and efficient operations at NanoTech.
- Protect NanoTech against scammers, including phishing attacks.
- Comply with industry, regulatory, and customer requirements.

**Your Role:**
- Report any theft, loss, or unauthorized disclosure of NanoTech information.
- Report attempts to steal NanoTech information, including suspicious phishing emails.
- Adhere to copyright, trade secret, patent, and IP laws.
- Log off from your email account(s) at the end of your workday.

As part of your onboarding process, you will receive your work devices and credentials. If you have any issues, please reach out to the IT department.

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
You will be using two-factor authentication to access network resources, computer resources, and Google services. For authentication, you will need your password and your security key. If you lose your security key or if it is damaged, you can log into your account using other backup mechanisms, such as the Google Authenticator app already installed on your work phone. In case of loss or damage to the security key, please reach out immediately to the IT department to replace your key.

**Why FIDO Security Keys?**
A FIDO security key is a phishing-resistant two-factor authentication (2FA) device. FIDO keys use cryptography to provide two-way verification: it ensures that you are logging into the service you originally registered the security key with, and the service verifies that it is the correct security key. This provides superior protection compared to code-based verification, like SMS and one-time passwords (OTPs).

We have already registered your security key with your accounts. Start inventing!

Please sign here to indicate that you have read this information and agree to adhere to it.
