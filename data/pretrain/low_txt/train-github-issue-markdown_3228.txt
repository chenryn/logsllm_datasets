Before version r69, when a `SpotLight` or its parent was added to the scene, the `SpotLight.target` was automatically added to the scene as well. This is no longer the case.

As a result, changing the `SpotLight.target` no longer affects the direction of the light. To work around this, you should manually add the `SpotLight.target` to the scene. Once added, updating the `SpotLight.target.position` will change the direction of the light accordingly.
