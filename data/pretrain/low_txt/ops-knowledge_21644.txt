When managing Group Policy settings within an Active Directory environment, it is essential to understand which policies, if chosen to be set, must be configured within the Default Domain Policy. Your question focuses on identifying these specific policies.

### Policies That Must Be Set in the Default Domain Policy

While it is generally recommended to avoid modifying the "Default Domain Policy" GPO for simplicity and maintainability, certain policies, if you choose to set them, must be configured within this GPO. These include:

1. **Account Policies**:
   - **Password Policy**: This includes settings such as password complexity, minimum password length, and password history.
   - **Account Lockout Policy**: This includes settings such as account lockout duration, threshold, and reset time.

2. **Security Options**:
   - **Automatically log off users when logon time expires**: Ensures that users are logged off when their logon hours expire.
   - **Rename administrator account**: Allows you to rename the built-in Administrator account.
   - **Rename guest account**: Allows you to rename the built-in Guest account.

For Windows Server 2003-based domain controllers (and presumably for Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2), additional Security Options settings that must be set in the Default Domain Policy include:

- **Accounts: Administrator account status**
- **Accounts: Guest account status**
- **Accounts: Rename administrator account**
- **Accounts: Rename guest account**
- **Network security: Force logoff when logon hours expire**

### Best Practices

- **Avoid Modifying the Default Domain Policy**: It is generally best to leave the "Default Domain Policy" GPO as is and create new GPOs for additional settings. This approach helps maintain a clean and manageable environment.
- **Link Order and Inheritance**: Ensure that the link order of GPOs at the root of the domain is correctly set to apply the desired policies. The effective setting will be determined by the resultant set of GPOs based on their link order and inheritance.

### Conclusion

If you decide to set the policies mentioned above, they must be configured within the Default Domain Policy. However, for other settings, it is advisable to create and link separate GPOs. This approach will help you maintain a clear and organized Group Policy structure.
