## VoIP Insecurity
- **Why are VoIP Networks Insecure?**
  - Basic Attacks: Discovery, Footprinting, Brute Force
  - Call Initiation, Spoofing, CDR and Billing Bypass
  - SIP Proxy Bounce Attack
  - Fake Services and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
  - (Distributed) Denial of Service (DDoS)
  - Hacking Trust Relationships of SIP Gateways
  - Attacking SIP Clients via SIP Trust Relationships
  - Advanced Fuzzing

### Out of Scope
- RTP Services and Network Tests
- Management and Additional Services
- XML/JSON Based SOAP Services

## SIP and NGN Overview
- **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)**: Only for Signalling, not Call Transport
  - Extended with Session Discovery Protocol
- **NGN (Next Generation Network)**: Transition from TDM and PSTN
  - Technologies: SIP, H.248/Megaco, RTP, MSAN/MGW
  - Devices: Smart Customer Modems & Phones
  - Benefits: Easy Management
  - Concerns: Security is often overlooked

### SIP Services
- **Internal IP Telephony**
  - Components: SIP Server, Support Servers, SIP Clients, Factory/Campus, SIP over VPN, Commercial Gateways, Analog/Digital PBX
- **Commercial Services**
  - Components: Soft Switch, VAS, CDR, DB Servers, MSAN/MGW, PSTN/ISDN, Distributed MPLS, 3rd Party Gateways, SDP Servers, Customers, RTP, Proxy Servers, Mobile

## Common Misconceptions
- **Administrators Think... Root Doesn't!**
  - Isolated VoIP Network: Open Physical Access, Weak VPN or MPLS
  - Abusing VoIP Requires Knowledge: Viproy simplifies this
  - Most Attacks: Network-based, Toll Fraud, DDoS, Mobile Client Attacks, Phishing, Surveillance, VAS Abuse
  - Well-Configured Devices: Weak Passwords, Old Software, Vulnerable Protocols

## Viproy VoIP Pen-Testing Kit
- **Overview**
  - Viproy: A Vulcan word meaning "Call"
  - Features: Metasploit Modules, Custom Header Support, Authentication, New Testing Tools (Trust Analyzer, Bounce Scan, Proxy)
  - Modules: Options, Register, Invite, Message, Brute Forcers, Enumerators, SIP Trust Analyzer, Service Scanner, SIP Proxy, Fake Service, DDoS Tester

### Basic Attacks
- **Discovery and Identification**
  - Finding and Identifying SIP Services and Purposes
  - Discovering Available Methods and Features
  - Identifying Valid Target Numbers, Users, Realm
  - Unauthenticated Registration, Brute Forcing, Invite Without Registration, Direct Invite, Invite Spoofing
- **Response Analysis**
  - Collecting Information from Response Headers (User-Agent, Server, Realm, Call-ID, Record-Route, etc.)
- **Registration and Subscription**
  - Actions/Tests: Brute Force, Detecting Special TOs, FROMs, Trunks, Weak Passwords
- **Invite, CDR, and Billing Tests**
  - Actions/Tests: Brute Force, Testing Call Limits, Unauthenticated Calls, CDR Management, INVITE Spoofing

### Advanced Attacks
- **SIP Proxy Bounce Attack**
  - Scanning Inaccessible Servers via SIP Proxies
  - Viproy Module: UDP Port Scan
- **Fake Services and MITM**
  - Adding a Feature to Regular SIP Clients
  - Collecting Credentials, Redirecting Calls, Manipulating CDR or Billing
  - Semi-Automated Communication Sequence
  - Viproy Features: SIP Proxy, Fake Service, Fuzzing Support
- **Denial of Service (DoS) and DDoS**
  - Locking All Customer Phones and Services
  - DoS Vulnerabilities: Bogus Requests, Concurrent Registered User/Call Limits, Voice Message Box, CDR, VAS based DoS
  - Multiple Invite: Overloading SIP Server's Call Limits
  - Viproy Features: DOS and DDoS Modules
- **SIP Amplification Attack**
  - IP Spoofed Packets, SIP Server Responses to Victim
  - Viproy PoC DDOS Module
- **Hacking SIP Trust Relationships**
  - NGN SIP Services Trust Each Other
  - Steps: Finding Trusted SIP Networks, Sending IP Spoofed Requests
  - Business Impact: DoS, Crashing/Exploiting Inaccessible Features, Call Redirection
- **Attacking a Client via SIP Trust Relationships**
  - Buffer Overflow in FROM Field
  - Viproy SIP Trust Module: Simple Fuzz Support

### Fuzzing
- **Fuzzing Targets**
  - SIP Clients, Hardware Devices, IP Phones, Video Conference Systems, Desktop and Mobile Software, Special SIP Devices
- **Old School Fuzzing**
  - Request and Response Fuzzing, Static vs Stateful, Smart Fuzzing
- **Viproy Fuzzing Features**
  - Skeleton for Feature Fuzzing, Multiple SIP Service Initiation, Integration with Metasploit, Custom Header Support, Raw Data Send, Authentication Support, Future Enhancements
