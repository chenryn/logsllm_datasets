## Buzzword
A buzzword is a term or phrase that has become fashionable or popular, often used to sound technical or important and to impress people.

## Introduction to IoT
### What is IoT?
IoT, or the Internet of Things, refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity that enable them to connect and exchange data.

### Flashback: How It All Began
- **DIY Smart Home**: The initial goal was to make homes smarter through do-it-yourself (DIY) projects.
- **Many Smart Devices**: There are numerous smart devices available, and even traditional "dumb" devices can be made smart.

### Babylon of "Standards"
- **Physical Layer / Data Link**
  - Bluetooth
  - RS232, RS485, CAN, eBUS
  - WiFi, Ethernet
  - ZigBee
  - 433, 866 MHz
  - And many others

- **Transport / Application Layer**
  - Textual Data
    - JSON
    - HTTP
    - XML
  - Binary-Oriented Protocols
    - Proprietary Protocols

## Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
- **Publisher-Subscriber Model**
- **Payload Agnostic**
- **Topics Organized in Tree-Like Structure**
- **Wildcards for Subscribing**
  - `#` for all levels from here down the tree
  - `+` for any single level
- **Operates Through TCP on Port 1883**
- **Supports "Last Will" and Persistent Topics**

### MQTT Topics
- **Examples of Topics**
  - `/house/attic/light`
  - `/house/basement/door`
  - `/house/basement/light`

- **Tree-Like Organized Structure**
  - Subscription to `/house/+/light` delivers all light topics in any room.
  - Subscription to `#` delivers every topic published by anyone to this MQTT server/broker.

### MQTT Broker Use Case in "Smart Home"
- **MQTT Broker**
  - Sensors (switch, door contact, thermometer)
  - Actors (smart bulb, garage doors, heating unit)
  - Bridges (for dumb devices)
  - Business Logic (provided by server software)

- **Typical Implementation**
  - Various smart and dumb devices bridged to MQTT.
  - One namespace of topics spans the entire building.
  - Commonly used MQTT broker: Mosquitto.
  - Business logic provided by server software (e.g., Domoticz, openHAB, Home Assistant, MQTT Dash, Node-Red).

## Security Concerns
- **Passwordless Dashboards**
  - Many dashboards have no password set.
  - Approximately 45,000 MQTT servers are available to connect.
  - About 26,000 MQTT servers are open without any password set.
  - You can subscribe to `#` to access all topics.
  - Even with a password, vulnerabilities may still exist.

- **Rules of the House**
  - No exploits.
  - Use what is available.
  - Cause no harm.
  - Even if you are tempted to do so.

## Home Automation Systems
- **Domoticz and Home Assistant**
  - Provide business logic.
  - Offer frontend/dashboard.
  - Usually integrate with MQTT.

### Demo Time
- **Domoticz**
- **Home Assistant**
- **MQTT Dash**
  - Simple Android/IOS app.
  - MQTT-centric, simple UI that reflects state or controls devices.
  - Interesting concept of storing/loading whole configuration via a "persistent" topic.

- **OwnTracks (PwnTracks)**
  - Android and IOS application for creating GPS tracking logs.
  - Supports MQTT.
  - More concerning than unsecured cameras.

### Conclusion
- **Real-World Example of Poor Security**
- **Educate People about Security**
- **Opt-Out Security Choice**
- **Please, Do Not Store Passwords in Plaintext**
- **There Is Only One Security**

### Final Thoughts
- **Stop Saying IoT Security!**
- **MQTT for Garden Automation**
- **Risks Can Be High**
- **Go Ahead and Ask!**
