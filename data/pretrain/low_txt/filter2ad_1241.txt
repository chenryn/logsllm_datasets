## Abstract
This paper provides a preliminary analysis of Google+’s privacy features. We identified that Google+ shares photo metadata with users who can access the photograph, which may lead to privacy violations. Additionally, Google+ encourages users to provide other names, such as maiden names, which could facilitate identity theft. We also found that Facebook lists are functionally and logically a superset of Google+ circles, even though Google+ offers a better user interface. Finally, we compare the use of encryption and the depth of privacy controls in Google+ and Facebook.

## 1. Introduction
Google launched its latest social networking site, Google+, on June 28, 2011. According to comScore, an Internet traffic watcher, Google+ registered 25 million users in its first five weeks [16], motivating a close scrutiny. The current leader in the social networking market and key rival of Google+, Facebook, has over 750 million registered users [14]. Facebook users share more than 30 billion pieces of content (photos, videos, web links, notes, blog posts, etc.) every month.

Like other social networks, Google+ is used for sharing private information, including status updates, occupation, employment history, home and work addresses, contact numbers, relationship status, photos, and videos. As Google+’s market penetration grows, so will the amount of data shared by its users. With the vast amount of data produced on social networks, privacy is a widely discussed issue in both media and academia [3]. To address this, Google+ introduced "circles" as a new concept.

The use of social networks has led to the disclosure of embarrassing information, loss of employment, suspension from school, and blackmail [4]. Social networks are also used for social phishing attacks. Phishers harvest email addresses to find the real names and social network profiles of their victims [17]. This is possible because both Google+ and Facebook require users to use their real names and allow searches based on email addresses. Once the real names and social network profiles are found, phishers extract more information, including people in the circles (or friend list) of the victim, any comments, and events attended. This information is then used to craft personalized phishing attacks, known as social phishing [13]. Identity theft costs the US economy $15.6 billion annually [12]. Moreover, social network status updates have facilitated robberies, where owners announced their absence from their property [15]. The large amount of data is also of interest to advertisers and marketers. According to a survey by Social Media Examiner, over 92% of marketers use social networks as a tool [18].

Given these concerns, it is crucial and timely to analyze Google+ and identify any privacy-related issues. This is the main goal of this paper.

### Our Contributions:
- We provide a preliminary analysis of privacy in Google+. We identify that Google+ shares the metadata of uploaded photos, which could lead to privacy violations (Section 2.1). Additionally, Google+ encourages users to provide past addresses and other names, such as maiden names, which could be used for identity theft (Section 2.2).
- We compare Google+ circles (its main privacy feature) to Facebook lists. We show that, although Google+ circles have a better graphical user interface, they are logically and functionally a subset of Facebook lists (Section 2.3).
- We also make other comparisons between Facebook and Google+, including the use of encryption and the ability to disable comments and message sharing (Section 2.4).

## 2. Google+ Privacy
In this section, we present some privacy-related problems and features of Google+. We also make a comparison with Facebook, when applicable.

### 2.1 Google+’s Photo Metadata
When a user uploads a photo on Google+, some metadata, including the name of the photo owner, the date and time the photo was taken, and the make and model of the camera, are made available to those with whom the photo is shared. This set of information, particularly the date and time, may seem relatively innocent but could lead to serious privacy concerns. For example, in August 2007, a divorce lawyer in Pennsylvania proved a client's spouse was unfaithful using electronic toll records [9]. With the metadata revealed by Google+, a user might leak enough information to be legally held liable on similar accounts.

Similarly, the make of the camera could be another concern. High-end cameras cost thousands of dollars, and there have been incidents where victims were killed for their cameras. For instance, in May 2011, a Greek citizen, 44, was killed for his camera while taking his wife to the hospital for childbirth [19]. As an example, the metadata of publicly shared pictures from Google co-founder Larry Page's Google+ profile reveals that he used a Canon EOS 5D Mark II camera, worth approximately USD 2000, for his vacation photographs. This information could incentivize robbers.

### 2.2 Cities Lived In and Other Names on Profile
In the "About" section of personal information, Google+ encourages users to provide the names of cities they lived in and other names. In the text box for other names, they suggest "For example: maiden name, alternative spelling." This information, combined with messages, photos, and comments on social networks and other online sources, can be used to infer family relationships. If someone can link a profile to the profile of the mother and if the mother provides the maiden name, this could be used for identity theft, as the mother’s maiden name is one of the most widely used secret questions [5]. Furthermore, past addresses can aid attackers in such attacks.

### 2.3 Google+ Circles vs. Facebook Lists
Paul Adams, a former Google employee, introduced the concept of social circles [2]. These social circles form the foundation of Google+ circles. By default, Google+ includes four circles: "friends," "family," "acquaintances," and "following." Users can remove, rename, or add new circles. A user can add any of her contacts to one or more circles by a simple drag and drop. Figure 2 shows the graphical interface of Google+ circles. The intersection of two or more circles can be a non-empty set. A user can share content with a specific set of circles, all circles, extended circles (people in all her circles and all people in the circles of the people in her circles), or with the public. Google+ does not allow exceptions; if content is shared with a larger circle, there is no way to exclude any subset of that circle. Anything shared with the public is shared with all circles, including the family and friends circle, which might not be what the user intends.

Facebook, on the other hand, calls all user connections "friends." Friends can be divided into groups called "lists." There are no default lists, so any structure must be created from scratch. Content on Facebook can be shared with one or more lists, similar to Google+ circles. However, Facebook allows for exceptions. For example, a user can share a message with a list called "All" (containing all contacts) and still make the content invisible to a "CoWorkers" list, as shown in Figure 3. Recently, a Facebook application called "Circle Hack" [1] has been launched, providing the Google+ circles graphical interface for Facebook lists. This further proves that Facebook lists are logically and functionally a superset of Google+ circles.

### 2.4 Google+ vs. Facebook: Other Comparisons
Facebook uses an encrypted channel only for user authentication (login), while Google+ uses it throughout the connection. This makes it harder to launch a man-in-the-middle attack against Google+. Additionally, Google+ allows finer control over the content shared by a user. A user can disable comments on a post at any time and enable them later, which can be useful for calming heated discussions. Facebook, on the other hand, provides coarser control, allowing users to block a user from the entire wall but not on an individual content basis. Furthermore, Google+ allows disabling the resharing of content on a content-by-content basis, which is not possible in Facebook. Finally, Google+ allows users to edit their comments, with the timestamp of the last edit remaining visible. This is not possible in Facebook.

## 3. Related Work
Bradshaw identified the first privacy flaw in Google+ [7]. The flaw was that any content shared with a particular circle could be reshared with anyone by someone from those circles. Although resharing of information is always possible in the electronic world, the simplicity and provision of a share button without proper authorization is a privacy problem. This issue has since been fixed by Google+.

Privacy and potential threats in social networks have been widely studied in recent years. One of the earliest works on potential threats to individual privacy, including stalking, embarrassment, and identity theft, was done by Gross et al. [11]. Felt [10] presented a vulnerability in Facebook Markup Language that led to session hijacking. Bonneau and Dhingra independently presented conditional and limited unauthorized access to Facebook photos [6, 8].

## 4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we provided a preliminary analysis of Google+ privacy. We expressed concern that Google+ shares the metadata of the photos uploaded by its users and encourages users to provide other names, such as maiden names, which may help in identity theft. We also compared Google+ circles with Facebook lists and showed that the latter is a superset of the former, both logically and functionally, even though Google+ provides a better graphical interface. Finally, we provided other comparisons, including the use of encryption and the possibility of modifying comments at a later stage, between Facebook and Google+.
