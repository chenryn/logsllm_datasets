**ABSTRACT**

Service networks are a new and promising research field that aims to enhance our understanding of service-based systems. These networks, which are reconstructed from information available on the web and made freely accessible, can provide insights into the evolution of global service networks. By examining the relationships and dependencies among cloud computing and governmental services, we can develop more efficient and balanced infrastructures. The challenge lies in creating a novel perspective by connecting models representing these services into networks. Theories, methods, and applications developed in this field will enable us to understand, describe, explain, analyze, predict, and control the structure and behavior of global service networks.

**1. INTRODUCTION**

Networks play an increasingly important role in many fields, with the Internet, the World Wide Web, and social networks being integral parts of everyday life. Service networks, another class of networks, are of emerging interest as worldwide economies become more service-based and interconnected. A service network is formally represented as a graph structure, where nodes represent services and edges represent the relationships and dependencies between them. The concept of open service networks is particularly significant because their study and analysis can lead to new scientific discoveries about how service-based systems operate at a global scale. The engineering of service networks, as opposed to ad hoc constructions, can result in more purposeful and robust networks.

**2. MOTIVATION SCENARIO**

Consider the interconnected nature of today's financial service networks. These networks are highly interdependent, and any disruption in one service can have far-reaching consequences. For example, the 2008 economic crisis initiated in the U.S. led to problems in European markets and almost caused Iceland to go bankrupt. Leading financial services closed (e.g., Lehman Brothers investment bank), others merged, and new services emerged. The configuration and topology of financial service networks changed as a reaction mechanism. While local information was available to each financial institution, an overall view of the global network ecosystem was not accessible to regulators, which could have helped anticipate the catastrophe.

**3. BUILDING BLOCKS**

Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in the study of networks across various scientific fields, including sociology, biology, and physical systems like power grids. However, the field of service networks has received less attention. As observed by Chesbrough and Spohrer [4], the abundance of information about people, technological artifacts, and organizations has never been greater, nor the opportunity to configure them meaningfully into service relationships that create new value. Only now, with the maturity of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and service management, design, and engineering, can we create service networks. Open movements, such as open source and open innovation, bring the initiative to share information on services. Linked data enables the interlinking of data globally, while semantic Web technologies provide a platform for information integration. Business models contribute theories to understand the structure of service models, and network science sets the theoretical stage for service network analysis. Three recent developments—Service-Dominant Logic (SDL) [6], Linked USDL for service descriptions [2], and OSSR for relationship descriptions [1]—provide the foundations for the reconstruction of open service networks.

**4. IMPACT ON SOCIETY**

Understanding how services evolve as networks and the risks and benefits of different topologies is becoming increasingly critical for society. The impact of service network research can be compared to contributions in the areas of social networks and power grids. Three main entities would benefit from this research: governments, regulatory bodies, and organizations. Governments can use scientific data to pass more adequate legislation. Regulatory bodies can analyze service networks to detect topological patterns such as oligopolies, monopolies, or cartels in service markets. Organizations can use service network tools to analyze global supply-chain networks, enabling a better understanding of the dynamic behavior of these networks at a global scale.

**5. CONCLUSIONS**

Societies are becoming increasingly service-based and interconnected. As service networks emerge, their analysis will help us better understand how service structures evolve, grow, and change over time. Service network analysis can provide theories, models, techniques, and tools to contribute to this understanding. From a practical perspective, service networks can model the way cloud computing services are emerging and how they are structured in terms of relationships and dependencies. Information on these networks can lead to the construction of more robust infrastructures against failures, such as the recent outage of Amazon AWS, which affected hundreds of companies like Netflix and Heroku.
