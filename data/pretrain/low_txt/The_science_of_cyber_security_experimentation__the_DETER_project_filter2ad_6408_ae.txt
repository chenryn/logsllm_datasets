### Extending and Enhancing Prior Research

We will build upon the results of earlier topics by incorporating recent advancements from our current research. One key area of prior work that remains relevant is the management of risky experiments, which is a significant component of our future roadmap.

To implement the management approach outlined in Section 3.3, we need to:
1. Develop DeterLab facilities for experimenters to create and refine specifications of their experiment’s requirements for Controlled Internet Access.
2. Create automation tools to generate an experiment-specific gateway node. These tools must not only meet the experimenter’s requirements but also adhere to the constraints defined in the T1/T2 approach described in Section 3.3.

### Future Elaboration on Risky Experiment Management

The future elaboration of risky experiment management will depend on the outcomes of two ongoing research areas:
1. **Modeling and Specification Work (Section 4.3)**: This will provide essential elements for experimenters to define constraints and invariants on their experiment's communication via controlled internet access.
2. **Container Work (Section 4.2)**: This will enable DETER project research staff to create reusable building blocks for gateway implementation. Each block will include advertisements that assist the automation tools in constructing a container to serve as a gateway node, implementing the required controls for controlled internet access as needed by the specific experiment.

### Federation and Multi-Party Experiments

Another critical part of our research roadmap is the expansion of prior work on federation to support a new form of DeterLab experimentation: multi-party experiments. In these experiments, the experimental apparatus is built from sub-components federated to create the whole. Each participant (federant) has complete information about their own sub-component but only partial information about other sub-components. This form of experiment can model various cyber-defense scenarios, such as adversarial situations (e.g., red-team/blue-team exercises), realistic forensic or defense scenarios (e.g., attack information about the attacker), or collaborative defense efforts where separate organizations collaborate without full visibility into each other's operations.

Support for multi-party experimentation will leverage the current full-production federation capability in DeterLab and the results of several ongoing DETER research areas:
1. **Modeling and Specification Work (Section 4.3)**: To state constraints and invariants on activities of each party.
2. **Container Work (Section 4.2)**: Essential for scaling out each party’s sub-apparatus to realistic proportions needed for the types of multi-party experiments currently envisioned.

### Integrating the Pieces: Towards a New Experimental Cybersecurity Research Paradigm

Our current and future research roadmap provides the foundation for advancing DeterLab with new capabilities. Our focus is on extending DeterLab's capabilities and integrating new and existing functionalities. Integration is crucial, including functional integration with the new ELM workbench, but more importantly, integration into a new methodology for the experiment lifecycle. Five key phases of this lifecycle are illustrated in Figure 7:

**Figure 7: New Cyber-Security Research Methodologies**
1. A new methodology for specifying experiments, including model-based specification and elements of previous experiment descriptions.
2. New tools to fully flesh out the structure of an experiment, focusing on essential elements and abstractions.
3. New technology for realizing the conceptual structure of an experiment by embedding it in a subset of DeterLab’s real and virtual resources for computation and networking.
4. New facilities and controls that enable larger-scale and more flexible use of federated systems and domain-specific resources available via federation.
5. Across all these areas, new mechanisms and facilities to share experiment building blocks among experimenters, allowing them to accelerate their experiment-creation work using the results and knowledge gained from previous DeterLab work.

As we gain experience with this integration, we expect that both we and DeterLab experimenters will develop cybersecurity experimentation methodologies that can accelerate the pace of cybersecurity innovation and significantly improve the scientifically demonstrated effectiveness of innovations as they move from the lab into practical use.
