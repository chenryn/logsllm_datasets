## Abstract
Systems relying on satellite positioning techniques such as GPS are vulnerable to spoofing attacks, where attackers inject fake positioning information. With the increasing use of drones and their reliance on GPS for localization, these systems become attractive targets for attacks aimed at hijacking or disrupting air safety surveillance. The latest development in air traffic surveillance is the Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) system, which aircraft use to periodically broadcast their location, speed, and other environmental measurements. The OpenSky Network, an open research project, collects ADS-B reports and makes them available for research purposes.

This poster presents a concept for detecting and localizing spoofing devices by leveraging the information provided by a large-scale air traffic surveillance system. We utilize ADS-B reports collected by the OpenSky Network and present initial results on the effectiveness of localizing spoofing sources.

## 1. Motivation
GPS is widely used in applications that require positioning or timing information. However, GPS signals are neither authenticated nor encrypted, making the system vulnerable to signal spoofing attacks. In such attacks, an attacker transmits fake signals that mimic those from satellites but with higher power and different time delays. GPS receivers lock onto these fake signals instead of the authentic ones, leading to the injection of false positioning information into systems like drone navigation or aircraft systems. Affected aircraft will then broadcast this false information via ADS-B. By analyzing the fake information in ADS-B reports, we aim to extract data to determine the attacker's location, thereby enabling faster resolution of potentially devastating incidents.

## 2. Contributions
The poster outlines a concept for detecting GPS spoofing attacks and localizing the spoofing source using existing ADS-B infrastructure. Specifically, it introduces a novel technique for localizing GPS spoofing devices by correlating the fake positioning information in ADS-B messages. The poster also presents initial simulation results based on real-world air traffic control data from the OpenSky Network, demonstrating that using reports from at least four aircraft, it is possible to detect and localize spoofing devices by rapidly narrowing down the search radius.

## 3. Method
Our method leverages the position advertisements that aircraft periodically broadcast for air traffic control. We use the reported position information from spoofed aircraft and the timestamps generated by ground-based sensors. Unlike other works that focus solely on spoofing detection, our approach explores the possibility of localizing the spoofing source. Our method is lightweight and does not require modifications to GPS receiving devices, utilizing already available data collected in real-time by air traffic control authorities and online flight tracking services. Reports from multiple ground-based sensors can be used to detect GPS spoofing attacks and localize the spoofing source.

## 4. Spoofing Detection
Spoofing attacks can be detected on the logical level by cross-checking multiple position estimates from each aircraft or by comparing reported locations from multiple aircraft. The first approach checks if the actual position of the aircraft, resolved by other means like RADAR or multilateration, is within a certain range of the position reported via ADS-B. A significant discrepancy can indicate a spoofing attack. The second approach compares position reports from multiple aircraft, which should be similar if they are affected by the same spoofing attack. Violations of air traffic restrictions can also indicate an ongoing spoofing attack.

## 5. Spoofer Localization
Upon detecting a spoofing attack, we need to trace the source to stop the attack. Our localization approach is based on the observation that a spoofer affecting multiple aircraft has different distances to each aircraft. Using these distances, we can express the positions of the aircraft as a function of the distance to the spoofing source and the velocity of the spoofed GPS track. At ground stations, we receive ADS-B reports from all affected aircraft. These reports allow us to formulate relationships incorporating the actual position of the aircraft, the spoofed track velocity, and the current spoofer position. By estimating the position of the aircraft via methods like multilateration and calculating the spoofed track velocity from the time series of reported GPS positions, we can numerically solve multiple equations to determine the spoofer's position, assumed to be the same for all currently affected aircraft.

## 6. Results
Initial results suggest that we can narrow down the spoofer's location to a search space with a radius of a few kilometers, representing a significant reduction compared to the overall search space. For example, we were able to reduce the search radius to less than ten kilometers, compared to several hundreds or even thousands of square kilometers observed by the sensors. These results are based on conservative assumptions and are expected to improve further. Additionally, our method only requires the fake signals of four aircraft to start narrowing down the potential spoofer location, achieving reasonable search space reductions within a few minutes after the spoofing attack is launched.

## 7. Related Work
GPS is known to be vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks. The requirements for successful GPS spoofing attacks have been analyzed, and various techniques for detecting and localizing spoofing attacks in wireless networks have been proposed. Some approaches employ multiple sensors at separate locations to detect spoofing. However, these methods often require more specialized GPS receivers, increasing complexity and power requirements, which is a critical drawback given the long standardization processes in the aviation industry.
