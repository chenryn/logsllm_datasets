## Who We Are
- **360 Technology** is a leading Internet security company in China, specializing in anti-virus security software for PCs and mobile devices.
- **UnicornTeam (https://unicorn.360.com/)**, established in 2014, focuses on security issues in various wireless telecommunication systems.
- **Notable Research:**
  - Low-cost GPS spoofing (DEFCON 23)
  - LTE redirection attack (DEFCON 24)
  - Attack on power line communication (BlackHat USA 2016)

## Voice Solutions in LTE Networks
- **VoLTE (Voice over LTE):**
  - Based on IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)
  - The ultimate goal of network evolution
- **CSFB (Circuit Switched Fallback):**
  - Switches from 4G to 3G or 2G during voice calls
- **SV-LTE (Simultaneous Voice and LTE):**
  - Allows simultaneous voice and data transmission but at a higher cost and increased power consumption.

## Occasional Discovery
- While using OsmocomBB as a cellphone to access the GSM network, we encountered a problem. During debugging, we discovered that a fake paging response could establish a connection to the network.

## Normal 2G Call vs. CSFB
- **Normal 2G Call:**
  - AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement) is performed for every call.
- **CSFB:**
  - No authentication step is present, making it vulnerable to impersonation attacks.

## Vulnerability in CSFB
- **Principle:**
  - An attacker can enter the GSM network without proper authentication, similar to someone entering a door without a badge.
- **Exploitation:**
  - Attackers can send a Paging Response on the 2G network, impersonating the victim, and hijack the call link.

## Experiment Environment
- **Hardware:**
  - C118
  - OsmocomBB L1
  - OsmocomBB L2/3
- **Demo Videos:**
  - [Demo Video 1]
  - [Demo Video 2]

## Exploitation I – Random Hijack
- **Attack Steps:**
  1. Listen on the PCH channel.
  2. Extract TMSI/IMSI from the paging message.
  3. Forge a paging response with the extracted TMSI/IMSI.
  4. Check if the MSC accepts the paging response.
- **Why Network Sends Paging on 2G:**
  - When a cellphone is in 4G, the network sends a paging message in 4G LTE PCH using S-TMSI. In some cases, the network also sends paging messages on 2G, allowing the use of TMSI captured on 2G to respond to CSFB calls on 4G.

## Hijack Result
- **C118 (with no SIM card) successfully hijacked a call from 139920.**

## What Can an Attacker Do Further?
- **If the attacker answers the incoming call:**
  - The caller will notice an abnormal voice.
- **Information Gained:**
  - Victim’s TMSI or IMSI
  - Caller’s phone number

## Exploitation II – Get Victim’s Phone Number
- **During an ongoing call, sending a 'CM Service Request' does not trigger authentication, and the network responds with 'CM Service Accept'. This allows the attacker to make a call to another phone and obtain the victim’s ISDN number.**

## Targeted Persistent Attack
- **Using TMSI:**
  - Once the attacker knows the TMSI, they can persistently send Paging Responses with this TMSI, regardless of whether there is an actual paging request.
- **Using IMSI:**
  - If the attacker knows the victim’s IMSI and location, they can continuously send paging responses with the IMSI to hijack the victim’s link.
- **Using ISDN Number:**
  - If the attacker knows the victim’s phone number, they can call the victim, capture the TMSI, and then use it to launch the attack.

## Advanced Exploitation – Attack Internet Account
- **Login with Verification SMS:**
  - Some applications allow login with a phone number and verification SMS without a password.
- **Reset Login Password:**
  - Many internet applications use verification SMS to reset login passwords. The attacker can initiate a password reset and hijack the verification SMS.

## Constraints
- **No Access to SS7 Core Network:**
  - The attack does not require access to the SS7 core network.
- **No Fake Base Station:**
  - The attack does not require a fake base station.
- **Victim Online in 4G:**
  - The victim remains online in the 4G network and is unaware of the attack.

## Different Behaviors from Different Terminals
- **Some cellphones are more susceptible to hijacking than others.**
- **Jamming:**
  - Jamming is needed to cut off the connection between the victim’s cellphone and the network.

## Failure Analysis
- **Successful Hijack:**
  - The attacker receives the call after sending the Paging Response.
- **Link Holding:**
  - The call may be interrupted if the victim’s cellphone initiates a Location Area Update (LUA) procedure in 2G, breaking the attacker’s link.

## Countermeasures
- **For Operators:**
  - Improve CSFB authentication procedures.
  - Accelerate VoLTE service deployment.
- **For Internet Service Providers:**
  - Be cautious about PSTN authentication in two-factor authentication.
  - Enhance password reset procedures with additional personal information checks.

## GSMA CVD Program
- **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Programme:**
  - Focuses on open standards-based technologies used across the mobile industry.
- **Acknowledgment:**
  - UnicornTeam received recognition from the GSMA, and the vulnerability information has been shared with operators who are addressing the issue.
