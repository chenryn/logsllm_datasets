# Potential Changes to Microsoft Elements

Please note that Microsoft may have made changes to the elements described in this section since my research and reporting of the issue. For more information, refer to the following link: [AdSecurity.org](https://adsecurity.org/?p=4277).

## Updated Documentation
- [Microsoft Docs: Elevate Access for Global Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin)

### Key Points
- **Elevate Access API**: [GitHub - PowerZure](https://github.com/hausec/PowerZure)
- **Compromise Office 365 Global Admin**
- **(Office 365) Global Admin (Azure) User Access Administrator**

### Role Assignments
- **Hacker Account Added to User Access Administrator**
- **Azure RBAC Role Monitoring**
- **What About Removal?**
- **Get Azure Owner Rights!**
- **Virtual Machine Contributor**: This role allows you to manage virtual machines but not access them, nor the virtual network or storage account they are connected to. [More Details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor)
- **Add Attacker-Controlled Account to Virtual Machine Contributor**

### Role Hierarchy
- **(Office 365) Global Admin**
- **(Azure) User Access Administrator**
- **(Azure) Subscription Admin**

### Separation of Administration
- Companies often have two groups managing different systems:
  - One team manages Active Directory & Azure AD.
  - Another team manages servers on-premises and in the cloud (IaaS).
  - These teams expect exclusive control over their respective areas.

### Why is This Issue Important?
- Customers usually do not expect an Office 365 Global Administrator to have the ability to control Azure role membership.
- Microsoft documented the Global Administrator as an "Office 365 Admin," not as a potential Azure administrator.
- Office 365 (Azure AD) Global Administrators can gain Azure subscription role administration access by toggling a single switch.
- Azure lacks granular control over who can run commands on sensitive Azure VMs like Azure-hosted Domain Controllers.
- Once the "Access management for Azure resources" bit is set, it remains set until the account that toggled the setting changes it back.
- Removing the account from Global Administrators does not remove it from "User Access Administrator" access.

### Detection Key Points
- This setting cannot be detected on Azure AD user accounts using PowerShell, the portal, or other methods.
- No Office 365/Azure AD logging indicates that an Azure AD account has set the "Access management for Azure resources" bit.
- No (Azure AD/O365) Audit Logs clearly identify this change.
- The "Set Company Information" log shows success for the tenant name and the account that performed it, but only identifies a change in "Company Information" with no detailed modified properties.
- No default Azure logging was found after adding the account to the VM Contributor role in Azure.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Monitor** the Azure AD role "Global Administrator" for membership changes.
- **Enforce** MFA on all accounts in the Global Administrator role.
- **Control** the Global Administrator role with Azure AD Privileged Identity Manager (PIM).
- **Monitor** the Azure RBAC role "User Access Administrator" for membership changes.
- **Ensure** sensitive systems like Domain Controllers in Azure are isolated and protected, ideally using a separate tenant for sensitive systems.

### MSRC Reporting Timeline
- **September 2019**: Reported to Microsoft.
- **Early October 2019**: MSRC responds, stating the issue appears to be by design and documentation is being updated.
- **Mid-October 2019**: Sent additional information to MSRC after testing detection and potential logging.
- **Late January 2020**: Notified MSRC about submitting this as part of a larger presentation at Black Hat USA & DEF CON 2020.
- **Documentation Update**: June 2020.
- **MSRC Security Incident**: Still open as of July 2020.
- Microsoft is looking into reworking this functionality to address the identified shortcomings.

### Potential Impact
- An attacker could take control of Azure resources, remove accounts from all roles, and ransom the Azure environment, leading to a form of Azure Ransomware.

### Next Level Considerations
- **On-Prem Datacenter**
- **Azure**
- **AWS**
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- **Federation Server**

### Recommendations
- Given that cloud IaaS is similar to on-prem virtualization, cloud attacks are similar.
- Connection points between on-prem and cloud need careful consideration.
- Domain Controllers can be vulnerable, regardless of location.
- Authentication flows between on-prem and cloud (and cloud-to-cloud) can be vulnerable.
- Protecting admin accounts is even more critical in a cloud-enabled world.
