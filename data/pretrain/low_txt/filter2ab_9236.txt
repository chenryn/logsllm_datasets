**Title: EU-21 Security Industry Call-to-Action: The Need for a Cloud Vulnerability Database**

The shared responsibility model in cloud security is failing. Companies are struggling to manage the increasing complexity of cloud environments, while vendors and cloud providers often fail to provide clear identification, tracking, or severity assessments for vulnerabilities discovered in their platforms. Additionally, there is a lack of transparency, as cloud providers do not fully disclose details about the exposure, impact, or mitigation steps for these vulnerabilities.

Join the Wiz Research Team as they share their experiences and conclusions from the disclosure process, which uncovered several unprecedented cloud vulnerabilities in AWS, GCP, and Azure. In this session, we will review key learnings and insights from the OMIGOD, ChaosDB, and AWS IAM cross-account vulnerabilities that we identified.

We will also argue for the need to extend the current Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) model to better accommodate cloud-specific vulnerabilities. The current CVE model is inadequate for the unique challenges posed by cloud environments. We call on the security community to join us in advocating for this much-needed change.
