**Acceptable and Economically Justifiable Business Conduct**

The Court has not found any cases applying the *Murphy* standard outside the context of antitrust law, and Donnelly has not cited any cases applying it to copyright law.

**Liability for Copyright Infringement**

Generally, liability for copyright infringement does not require the infringer to have knowledge of wrongdoing. The Copyright Act allows for the award of damages even if the infringer was unaware and had no reason to believe their actions constituted infringement. 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2); see also *Coogan v. City of New York*, 2005 WL 2789311, at *4 (noting that damages may be increased for willful infringement and stating that a finding of willfulness “does not require that a defendant act with the ‘specific intent’ to violate the copyright protection”).

Similarly, courts have held that vicarious liability, even for corporate officers, does not require knowledge that the conduct is infringing. See *MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.*, 545 U.S. 913, 930 n.9 (2005) (vicarious liability may be imposed even if the defendant initially lacks knowledge of the infringement); *Fonovisa, Inc. v. Cherry Auction, Inc.*, 76 F.3d 259, 262 (9th Cir. 1996) (vicarious liability may be imposed even if the defendant was unaware of the infringement); *S. Bell Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Associated Tel. Directory Publishers*, 756 F.2d 801, 811 (11th Cir. 1985) (corporate officers are liable even if they were ignorant of the infringement); *Novell, Inc. v. Unicom Sales, Inc.*, No. C-03-2785 MMC, 2004 WL 1839117, at *17 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 17, 2004) (in determining the liability of corporate officers, it is immaterial whether such individuals are aware that their acts will result in infringement); *Foreverendeavor Music, Inc. v. S.M.B., Inc.*, 701 F. Supp. 791, 793 (W.D. Wash. 1988) (a corporate officer’s doubts about the plaintiff’s right to enforce copyright laws do not absolve him from liability for infringing copyrights).

**Donnelly’s Argument**

Donnelly argues, with some persuasive force, that he should not be held personally liable when he could not reasonably be expected to know that the Ninth Circuit applied copyright law to the copying of software into RAM. However, as shown by the cases cited above, knowledge is not required. The Supreme Court has noted that vicarious liability “allows imposition of liability when the defendant profits directly from the infringement and has a right and ability to supervise the direct infringer, even if the defendant initially lacks knowledge of the infringement.” *MGM Studios, 545 U.S. at 930 n.9*. In support of this statement, the Supreme Court cited *Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. v. H.L. Green Co.*, 316 F.2d 304, 308 (2d Cir. 1963), which provides a helpful explanation of the strict-liability policy of copyright law:

> “The cases are legion which hold the dance hall proprietor liable for the infringement of copyright resulting from the performance of a musical composition by a band or orchestra whose activities provide the proprietor with a source of customers and enhanced income. He is liable whether the bandleader is considered, as a technical matter, an employee or an independent contractor, and whether or not the proprietor has knowledge of the compositions to be played or any control over their selection.”

The principle extracted from these dance hall cases is sound. *Green* licensed one facet of its business to Jalen Amusement Company, retaining the ultimate right of supervision and a financial interest in the success of the record concession. Thus, *Green* was liable for unauthorized sales of “bootleg” records, even in the absence of an intention to infringe or knowledge of infringement. This principle of strict liability in copyright law is well-established, and courts have consistently refused to honor the defense of absence of knowledge or intention. *Shapiro, 316 F.2d at 307-08*; see also *Fonovisa, 76 F.3d at 261-64* (following *Shapiro* and referring to it as the “landmark case” on vicarious liability for copyright infringement).

**Application to Donnelly**

Donnelly clearly supervised the infringing and circumventing activities of MDY and profited personally from their success. Applying this well-established law, Donnelly is liable for MDY’s vicarious copyright infringement, contributory copyright infringement, and DMCA violations.

**Permanent Injunction**

Under 17 U.S.C. § 502(a), this Court is empowered to grant a permanent injunction “as it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.” *MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.*, 518 F. Supp. 2d 1197, 1208 (C.D. Cal. 2007). To obtain a permanent injunction under section 502(a), Blizzard must satisfy a four-part test: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction. *eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.*, 547 U.S. 388, 391-92 (2006).

Blizzard cites *MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.*, 991 F.2d 511, 520 (9th Cir. 1993), asserting that courts have routinely granted permanent injunctions when liability has been established and there is a threat of continuing violations. Dkt. #97 at 6. However, the Court agrees with other district courts that *MAI*’s two-part rule did not survive *eBay*. *MAI* should only be relevant to the extent it informs the *eBay* analysis. *Grokster, 518 F. Supp. 2d at 1209-10*; see *Designer Skin, LLC v. S & L Vitamins, Inc.*, No. CV 05-3699-PHX-JAT, 2008 WL 4174882, at *3 (D. Ariz. Sept. 5, 2008).

Blizzard further asserts that courts in copyright cases traditionally have held that irreparable harm is presumed. Dkt. #97 at 6. After *eBay*, however, the presumption of irreparable harm no longer inures to the benefit of plaintiffs. *The eBay Court plainly stated that [p]laintiffs ‘must demonstrate’ the presence of the traditional factors, and therefore have the burden of proof with regard to irreparable harm.* *Grokster, 518 F. Supp. 2d at 1211*; see *Designer Skin, 2008 WL 4174882, at *4* (citing *eBay, 547 U.S. at 391*); *Magna-RX, Inc. v. Holley*, No. CV 05-3545-PHX-EHC, 2008 WL 5068977, at *4 (D. Ariz. Nov. 25, 2008).

**Analysis of the Four-Part Test for a Permanent Injunction**

**A. Irreparable Injury**

Blizzard has established irreparable injury. While Blizzard can calculate the amount of money it spends annually to detect and eliminate bots from its game, it cannot determine the extent of damage caused by Glider to its reputation and customer goodwill. Blizzard received 500,000 customer complaints regarding bots in WoW between December 2004 and March 2008. The use of Glider gives players an unfair advantage and imbalances the in-game economy. The damage to Blizzard’s reputation and customer goodwill constitutes irreparable harm. *Rent-A-Center, Inc. v. Canyon Television & Appliance Rental, Inc.*, 944 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir. 1991) (intangible injuries, such as damage to ongoing recruitment efforts and goodwill, qualify as irreparable harm); *MySpace, Inc. v. Wallace*, 498 F. Supp. 2d 1293, 1305 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (harm to business goodwill and reputation is unquantifiable and considered irreparable).

**B. Remedies at Law**

This factor is closely related to the first. Because the damage to Blizzard’s goodwill and the loss of its customers caused by Glider cannot be calculated with any certainty, traditional legal remedies such as monetary damages are inadequate to redress Blizzard’s harm.

**C. Balance of Hardships**

On one hand, failure to enjoin the sale of Glider will result in a continuation of Blizzard’s injuries. On the other hand, enjoining the sale of Glider will put MDY out of business and eliminate a significant source of income for Donnelly. MDY and Donnelly argue that their hardship would be greater and urge the Court to deny a permanent injunction. However, where the only hardship that the defendant will suffer is lost profits from an activity shown likely to be infringing, such an argument merits little equitable consideration. *Triad Sys. Corp. v. Se. Express Co.*, 64 F.3d 1330, 1338 (9th Cir. 1995). Here, the conduct has been shown to be both tortious and infringing, making the hardship factor favor an injunction.

**D. Public Interest**

Congress has determined that the public interest is served by protecting the creative works of those who obtain copyright protection. Congress has concluded in the DMCA that the public interest disfavors those who circumvent technological measures designed to protect creative works. Although the public interest also favors creativity and open competition, MDY is not a competitor of Blizzard. MDY does not offer a competing computer game but persuades Blizzard customers to violate their contract with Blizzard for MDY’s financial advantage. The public interest may favor full and honest competition, but MDY ultimately is an exploiter, not a competitor.

**Conclusion**

The Court finds that all four requirements for a permanent injunction are satisfied. The Court will enter a permanent injunction against the continued sale, distribution, and servicing of Glider.

**Stay of the Injunction**

MDY and Donnelly argue that the Court’s decision may be reversed on appeal and that MDY should not be put out of business while the appeal is pending. Donnelly testified that even twelve months of injunction would put MDY out of business forever. The Court recognizes that MDY and Donnelly will ask the Ninth Circuit to overturn the RAM-copying and ownership holdings of *MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.*, 991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir. 1993). Because the parties have not briefed the stay of a permanent injunction, the Court will require the parties to file memoranda addressing that issue. The Court will not enter the permanent injunction until it has decided whether the injunction should be stayed pending appeal.

**Order**
