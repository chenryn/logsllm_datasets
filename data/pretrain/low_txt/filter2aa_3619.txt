# BSidesTLV 2019 CTF

This section contains various writeups for the [2019 BSidesTLV CTF](https://ctf19.bsidestlv.com). I participated as a member of the [JCTF team](https://jctf.team/), which secured second place in the competition. The final scoreboard is shown below:

The competition was highly competitive, with the battle for the top positions continuing until the very end.

Personally, I found the [DoSaTTaCK challenge](DoSaTTaCK.md) to be particularly enjoyable. It would be great to see more Denial-of-Service (DoS) based challenges in future CTFs.
