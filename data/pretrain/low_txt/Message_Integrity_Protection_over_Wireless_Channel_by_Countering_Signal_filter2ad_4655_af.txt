### Evaluation of M2 for Randomness in LoS Part

In this section, we evaluate the use of M2 to assess the randomness of the Line-of-Sight (LoS) component. In practice, a Type III attacker, who does not make any effort to estimate the channel, cannot implement M2. Therefore, when evaluating the attacker's performance, only M1 should be considered.

### Simulation Results and Analysis

The simulation results are presented in Figure 13. The key observations are as follows:

1. **Detection Probability at Low Correlation Coefficients**:
   - When the correlation coefficient \(\beta\) is small, the detection probability under M2 is lower than that under M1. This indicates that the variation in Channel State Information (CSI) decreases after subtracting the average value. For a subset of antenna modes, the radiation patterns are similar, and the LoS part can be approximated by the average CSI.
   - As \(\beta\) increases, the difference between M1 and M2 diminishes. For a smaller number of antenna modes, the radiation patterns become distinct, and the average CSI cannot be used to approximate the LoS part.

2. **Local Maximum Detection Probability**:
   - At \(\beta = 0.05\), the correlation coefficient \(r_{\bar{h}g}\) reaches a local maximum, leading to a local minimum in detection probability.

3. **Optimal Detection Probability**:
   - For \(0.08 \leq \beta \leq 0.26\), the detection probability under M1 remains optimal, regardless of \(r_{\bar{h}g}\). This implies that the variance of CSI dominates the detection probability, and the attacker cannot cancel any message.

4. **Stable CSI with One Antenna Mode**:
   - When \(\beta \geq 0.265\), only one antenna mode remains, causing the Reconfigurable Antenna (RA) to regress to a Deterministic Antenna (DA). This results in stable CSI, and in an ideal case, the attacker can completely cancel the message.

### Future Work

Future work will focus on applying the design methodology to defend against other types of attacks or enhance existing protection mechanisms in wireless systems, such as friendly jamming. Additionally, we plan to extend our defense framework to Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems.
