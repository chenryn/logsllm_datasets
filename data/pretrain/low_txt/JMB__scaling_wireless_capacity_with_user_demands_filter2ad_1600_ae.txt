### Figure 11: Diversity Throughput
**Throughput of a JMB client when using diversity with 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 APs. JMB can achieve close to the maximum rate even for a client that cannot receive any packets with 802.11.**

### 11.4 Diversity
As described in §8, in addition to providing multiplexing gains, JMB can also enhance throughput through diversity. In this section, we investigate the diversity gains provided by JMB.

#### Method
We placed several APs in random locations within the testbed and positioned one node at a client location, ensuring it had roughly similar SNRs to all APs. We then computed the throughput using both regular 802.11 and JMB. The experiment was repeated with the number of APs varying from 2 to 10, and the results were plotted for the range of operational SNRs of 802.11.

#### Results
Figure 11 shows the throughput of 802.11 and JMB as a function of SNR for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 APs. Notably, JMB provides significant gains over 802.11, especially at low SNRs. For example, a client with 0 dB channels to all APs (i.e., its received power from each AP is about the same as the noise) cannot achieve any throughput with 802.11. However, the figure indicates that, with 10 APs, such a client can achieve a throughput of 21 Mbps with JMB. Thus, using JMB for diversity can significantly expand the coverage range of an 802.11 deployment and alleviate dead spots. This is expected because, with JMB’s coherent diversity, using multiple APs to coherently combine the signal can provide a multiplicative increase in the SNR of \(N^2\) [39], resulting in significant throughput improvements in the low SNR regime.

### 12. Conclusion
This paper presents a system for joint beamforming from distributed independent transmitters. The key challenge in delivering this system is to perform accurate phase synchronization across multiple distributed transmitters. Key lessons learned from building and testing the system with real hardware include:
1. Estimates of frequency offset can be made accurate enough to predict (and hence correct) phase misalignment within an 802.11 packet; however, these estimates cannot be used across multiple packets due to large build-ups in phase errors over time.
2. Joint multi-user beamforming can be achieved by synchronizing the phases of all senders to one lead sender, without imposing any phase synchronization constraints on the receivers.

We believe that the design of JMB has broader implications than those explored in this paper. Specifically, several areas of information theory, such as lattice coding, noisy network coding, and transmitter cooperation for cognitive networks [26, 18, 23], assume tight phase synchronization across transmitters. We are optimistic that the algorithms presented in this paper can bring these ideas closer to practical implementation.

### Figure 12: Throughput Achieved Using JMB on Off-the-Shelf 802.11n Cards
JMB significantly improves the performance of off-the-shelf 802.11n cards at high (>18 dB), medium (12-18 dB), and low (6-12 dB) SNRs.

### Figure 13: Fairness Results
For all nodes in our testbed, JMB delivers a throughput gain between 1.65-2×, with a median gain of 1.8× across SNRs. This shows that JMB provides similar throughput gains for every node in the network.

### 11.5 Compatibility with 802.11
Finally, as described in §6, JMB is compatible with existing 802.11n cards. In this section, we investigate whether JMB can deliver significant throughput gains when used with commodity 802.11n cards. Since each AP and each 802.11n card in this system has 2 antennas, this experiment also verifies that JMB can provide its expected gains with multi-antenna transmitters and receivers.

#### Method
We placed 2 JMB nodes at random AP locations in the testbed and 2 802.11n receivers at random client locations in the testbed. For each topology, we computed the total throughput with 802.11n and with JMB. As before, we computed the 802.11n throughput by giving each transmitter an equal share of the medium. The experiment was repeated across multiple topologies and the entire range of SNRs.

#### Results
Figure 12 shows the total throughput with and without JMB at high, medium, and low SNRs. With two receivers in this experiment, the theoretical throughput gain compared to 802.11n is 2×. The chart shows that JMB delivers an average gain of 1.67-1.83× across all SNR ranges. Similar to the case with USRP receivers, the gains in the high SNR regime are larger than those in the low SNR regime.

We now investigate JMB’s fairness, i.e., whether JMB can deliver its throughput gains for every receiver in the network across all locations and SNRs. Figure 13 shows the CDF of the throughput gain achieved by JMB compared to 802.11n across all runs. The results show that JMB delivers throughput gains between 1.65-2× for all the receivers, indicating that JMB is fair to the receivers in the network.

### Appendix
#### A. Decoupling Measurements to Different Receivers
For simplicity, we focus on the example of two APs and two clients in Fig. 2. Let us consider a system where the channels, \(h_{11}\) and \(h_{12}\), to receiver 1 are measured at time \(t_1\), and the channels, \(h_{21}\) and \(h_{22}\), to receiver 2 are measured at time \(t_2\). For a subsequent transmission at time \(t\), the channels experienced by receiver 1 experience a rotation corresponding to the time \(t - t_1\), while the channels experienced by receiver 2 experience a rotation corresponding to time \(t - t_2\). In particular, the channel matrix experienced at time \(t\) can be written as:

\[
H(t) = \begin{pmatrix}
h_{11} e^{j(\omega_{R1} - \omega_{T1})(t - t_1)} & h_{12} e^{j(\omega_{R1} - \omega_{T2})(t - t_1)} \\
h_{21} e^{j(\omega_{R2} - \omega_{T1})(t - t_2)} & h_{22} e^{j(\omega_{R2} - \omega_{T2})(t - t_2)}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Recall that for JMB to perform distributed phase synchronization, we need to decompose \(H(t)\) into the form \(R(t) H T(t)\), where \(H\) is time-invariant, and the time-dependent matrices \(R(t)\) and \(T(t)\) are diagonal. The \(i\)-th diagonal entry of \(T(t)\) (similarly \(R(t)\)) depends only on parameters that the \(i\)-th AP (similarly \(i\)-th receiver) can estimate locally. The APs can then all use the time-invariant matrix \(H\) to calculate their beamforming signal and perform correction using the relevant entry of \(T(t)\).

We observe that \(H(t)\) can indeed be written in this desired form. Specifically, we can write \(H(t)\) as \(R(t) H T(t)\), where

\[
R(t) = \begin{pmatrix}
e^{j(\omega_{R1} - \omega_{T1})(t - t_1)} & 0 \\
0 & e^{j(\omega_{R2} - \omega_{T1})(t - t_2)}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
H = \begin{pmatrix}
h_{11} & h_{12} \\
h_{21} & h_{22} e^{-j(\omega_{T1} - \omega_{T2})(t_2 - t_1)}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
T(t) = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & e^{j(\omega_{T1} - \omega_{T2})(t - t_1)}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Note that \(H\) is now time-invariant as desired. The entries only depend on the oscillator offset between times \(t_1\) and \(t_2\). Slave AP \(i\) can easily compute this offset by using the reference channel, \(h_{\text{lead}}\), from the lead measured at times \(t_1\) and \(t_2\).

Further, note that the diagonal entries of the matrix \(T(t)\) only depend on the frequency offset of the corresponding slave AP from the lead AP, and hence each slave AP can, as before, observe the channel of the sync header, compute the oscillator offset using the channel measured at time \(t_1\) as reference, and correct its transmission appropriately.

Similarly, the diagonal entries of the matrix \(R(t)\) only depend on the frequency offset of the corresponding receiver from the lead AP, and hence each receiver can independently decode its packet as if it were sent from a single transmitter.

Intuitively, this scheme can be understood as the slave AP rotating its measured channel to receiver 2 back to the time \(t_1\) by multiplying \(h_{22}\) by \(e^{-j(\omega_{T1} - \omega_{T2})(t_2 - t_1)}\), and then performing all future channel corrections relative to the time \(t_1\). This is why it corrects by the time-dependent quantity \(e^{-j(\omega_{T1} - \omega_{T2})(t - t_1)}\) shown in \(T(t)\).
