When you click on the triple horizontal lines to expand the top bar, and then switch back to a full-size window, you may encounter an issue where dropdown menus no longer function as expected. 

To reproduce this issue in jsfiddle, it is recommended that you use two monitors. This is because the navigation does not transition smoothly from the mobile view to the desktop view.
