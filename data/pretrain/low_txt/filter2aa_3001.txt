# When Tapes Go Missing: Understanding the Risks and Mitigation Strategies

## Introduction
When data tapes go missing, it is crucial to understand the potential risks and the steps that can be taken to mitigate them. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the implications of lost or stolen data tapes, the cost of such incidents, data breach laws, and methods for recovering and protecting data.

### Key Points from Industry Experts
- **Robert Stoudt, IBM-ISS (PI:EMAIL)**:
  - "It is important for customers to note that these tapes cannot be read without specific computer equipment and software."
  - "The missing tapes require a tape drive to be read, and cannot be viewed from a PC."
- **President & CEO Hortica, Robert McClellan**:
  - "It is important for customers to note that these tapes cannot be read without specific computer equipment and software."
- **IBM Spokesman, Fred McNeese**:
  - "The administration continues to maintain that it does not believe the information has been accessed because it would require specific hardware, software, and expertise."

## Agenda

## Cost of Losing Media
### Impact on the Company
- **Trade Secrets**
- **Confidential Financial Information**
- **Customer Data**
- **Employee Data**
- **Company Image**

### Civil Damages
- **Tech//404® Data Loss Cost Calculator**: Estimates range from $1,000 to $21,000 per person.
  - [Calculator Link](http://www.tech-404.com/calculator.html)

### Case Study: Ohio
- **Akron Beacon Journal**: The state paid over $700,000 for identity theft protection services and an independent review.
- **Incident Details**: A tape was stolen from an intern's unlocked car, who had been designated to take the backup device home as part of a standard security procedure.
- **Administration Statement**: "The administration continues to maintain that it does not believe the information has been accessed because it would require specific hardware, software, and expertise."

## How Tapes Can Be Lost
- **Theft**
- **Lost in Transit**
- **End of Life/Discarding Media**
  - **Ebay**
  - **Corporate Auctions**
  - **Dumpster Diving**

### Case Study: E-Bay Purchased Tapes
- **Out of 20 DLT tapes purchased**:
  - 1 physically damaged
  - 2 data unreadable due to hardware
  - 5 were short erased
  - 12 were corporate backups

**Questions to Consider**:
- Do you securely erase your data?
- Do you securely destroy your tapes?

## Data Breach Notification Laws
### Disclaimer
- I am not a lawyer. Consult your legal counsel.

### US State Laws
- Each state with a Data Breach law defines:
  - **Personal Data**: Name, Address, SSN, CC, Biometrics, Driver License number, account number, etc.
  - **Encryption Exemption**
  - **Obfuscated Data Exemption**
  - **Timelines for Notifications**
  - **Allowed Methods of Notification**

- **VigilantMinds Law Matrix**: Summarizes laws by state as of February 2007.
  - [Matrix Link](http://www.solutionary.com/pdfs/vm/breach_matrix_feb07_email.pdf)

### US Federal Laws
- **Current Federal Laws**: Lax
- **Safe Harbor**: Allows companies to self-certify.
  - [Safe Harbor Link](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/)
- **Proposed Bills**:
  - Senate Bill 239 (Notification of Risk to Personal Data Act of 2007)
  - Senate Bill 1178 (Identity Theft Prevention Act)

### Other Countries
- **EU Privacy Directive 95/46/EC**: Harmonizes data protection legislation.
  - [Directive Link](http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/overview/index_en.htm)
  - [International Privacy Laws](http://www.informationshield.com/intprivacylaws.html)
  - [Search on Data Protection and Privacy Laws](http://www.privacyinternational.org)

## Recovering the Data
### Tape Drives and Recording Formats
- **Drives**: DLT, 8mm, 4mm, LTO, etc.
- **Recording Formats**: Helical scan, Longitudinal Recording, etc.

### Forensics
- **Papers**:
  - **Forensic Acquisition and Analysis of Magnetic Tapes** by Bruce J. Nikkel
    - [Paper Link](http://www.digitalforensics.ch/nikkel05.pdf)
  - **Tape Media Forensic Analysis**
    - [Article Link](http://www.expertlaw.com/library/forensic_evidence/tape_media.html)
- **Third-Party Services**:

### Challenges in Tape Forensics
- Not as simple or complete as HDD forensics.
- **DD Command**: Can create a 'near complete' image but misses slack space and EOD markers.
- **Drive Firmware**: Can prevent access to significant portions of media.
- **Short Erase and EOD Markers**: Defeatable with customized firmware.

### Steps to Baseline a Tape under Linux
- **Obtain Tape Information**: `tapeinfo -f`
- **Set Tape Block Size**: `mt -f setblk 0`
- **Acquire Copy of Data**: `dd if= of= bs=256k`
- **Repeat 'dd' to Image Every File on Tape Up to EOD**

### TAPECAT
- **Tape Utility Command**: Automates review of the tape, provides file size and data type information.
  - [TAPECAT Link](http://www.inventivetechnology.at/tapecat/)

### Using Original Backup Utility
- **Common Backup Software**: Amanda, ARCserve, TAR, ufsdump/dump, Windows NTBackup, Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM)
- **Cons**:
  - Cost of license
  - Not all applications can import rogue tapes

### Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM)
- **Unique Backup Solution**: Only performs incremental backups.
- **Database**: Tracks data's life on tapes.
- **No Built-in Method to Import Unknown Tapes**: If not in the database, it doesn’t exist.
- **TSM Expiration**: Old data is expired while new data is added, causing tape utilization to drop until reclamation threshold is hit.

### TSM Tape Layout
- **First File**: Tape Label using IBM871 character set.
- **TSM Data Files**: Example of data layout.

### Recovering TSM Tapes
- **AdsmTape**: Recovers client name, architecture, and file name using `dd | strings | grep`.
  - [Project Link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/adsmtape/)

### Introducing TSMtape
- **TSMtape**: Recovers files from Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) v5.x.
  - [Project Link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tsmtape)
- **Usage**:
  ```sh
  ./TSMtape [-R|restore]   
  or
  ./TSMtape [-A|--audittape]  
  ```
- **Options**:
  - `-h, --help`: Display help and exit.
  - `-A, --audit`: Output list of files stored on tape with supporting details in CSV format.
  - `-R, --restore`: Restore files.
  - `-v[vv]`: Print additional debugging information.

### TSMtape Output
- **Example**:
  ```sh
  ./TSMtape --restore /dev/st0 /etc/shadow /tmp/recovered
  ./TSMtape --audit /dev/st0 / /tmp/tapefiles.csv
  ```

## Mitigation
### Protecting Your Data
- **Inventory**: Know what data you have.
- **Data Encryption**: Client/server side, tape drive (LTO4).
- **Data Destruction Standards/Requirements**.

### Wiping/Erasing
- **The Eliminator 4000FS**: A belt-driven degausser for high-coercivity hard disk drives, Super DLT tape, and DLT IV tape.
  - [Product Link](http://www.periphman.com/degaussing/degaussers/4000fs.shtml)

### Complete Destruction
- **Do-It-Yourself Destruction**: Bash it, heat it, smelt it, microwave it, shred it.
