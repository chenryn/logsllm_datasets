### Limitations and Future Work

#### Potential Bias in App Selection
The selection of popular apps for our study may have introduced a bias, as participants are generally more familiar with these applications. This familiarity can lead to a reluctance to deny permission requests from these apps. To mitigate this, collecting data from a broader range of apps, including less frequently used ones, would be necessary. However, this would require a longer-term user study to gather sufficient data. Additionally, techniques to handle data sparsity will be essential.

#### Simplified Decision Modeling
Our prediction model currently considers only contextual factors that can be collected by users' smartphones. There are likely other contextual factors that are important but not included in our approach. Furthermore, non-contextual factors, such as psychological elements, also play a significant role in privacy decision-making [20].

#### Data Set Size
The current data set is not large enough to reliably train advanced machine learning models, perform participant clustering, or obtain a robust confidence metric. Therefore, we plan to conduct a more extended data collection campaign involving a larger number of participants.

#### Data Quality
We implemented measures to remove noisy decision data from our dataset (Section V). However, we cannot fully validate whether participants made decisions that accurately reflected their intentions. For example, some participants might have provided biased, fake, or random decisions, which could explain why certain participants are more difficult to predict.

### Conclusion

As the number of apps, data types, and permissions on mobile platforms continues to grow, users increasingly need better mechanisms to manage these permissions. Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques are already being employed for security purposes in mobile platforms like Android [58]. It is logical to extend these techniques to help users better control their privacy on mobile devices.

We introduced SmarPer, an advanced permission mechanism for Android, designed to address two key limitations of current mobile permission systems: the static nature of permission policies and the poor trade-off between privacy and utility. After initial training with decision data and corresponding contextual information, SmarPer uses machine learning to infer users' permission-decision patterns at runtime and automatically respond to future permission requests (not yet supported). Additionally, SmarPer offers "obfuscated" decisions to reduce the information revealed to apps while still providing some utility.

We deployed our SmarPer implementation to 41 users under realistic conditions, collecting their permission decisions and contextual information over approximately 10 days. Using a Bayesian linear regression approach, we achieved a mean incorrect classification rate (ICR) of 0.20 (±0.03), representing a 50% relative improvement over a static policy baseline. Our results indicate that our model can learn to predict users' decisions with good accuracy and that contextual information is crucial for this task.

For future work, we plan to expand our dataset of permission decisions to train more advanced models for improved accuracy. We will also evaluate exploration-exploitation trade-off methods to automate decisions at runtime, completing our SmarPer implementation and moving closer to automatic permission management in smartphones.

### Appendix A: Distribution of Decisions Per App

Table II shows the total number of decisions per app collected during our study (Section V). For each app, it also shows the distribution of decisions per data type (i.e., contacts, location, storage) and for each data type, the distribution of the type of decision (i.e., allow, obfuscate, deny). These numbers highlight the importance of selecting popular apps in our study to collect enough decision data within the allotted time; only 9 apps have more than 200 decisions.
