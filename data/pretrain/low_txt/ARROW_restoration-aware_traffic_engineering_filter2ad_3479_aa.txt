## Abstract
Fiber cut events can reduce the capacity of wide-area networks (WANs) by several terabits per second (Tbps). In this paper, we propose a system called ARROW to restore lost capacity by reconfiguring wavelengths from cut fibers to healthy ones. We address two key challenges that have made previous solutions impractical:

1. **Partial Restorability**: Our measurements show that, contrary to common belief, the lost capacity is often only partially restorable. This introduces a cross-layer challenge in Traffic Engineering (TE) that has not been previously considered: "Which IP links should be restored and by how much to best match the TE objective?" ARROW's restoration-aware TE system takes a set of partial restoration candidates (referred to as LotteryTickets) as input and proactively finds the best restoration plan.

2. **Reconfiguration Latency**: Previous work has not accounted for the reconfiguration latency of amplifiers, which can add tens of minutes of delay in practical settings. ARROW leverages optical noise loading to bypass amplifier reconfiguration, reducing the end-to-end restoration latency to eight seconds.

We evaluate ARROW using large-scale simulations and a testbed. Our results demonstrate that ARROW can support 2.0√ó‚Äì2.4√ó more demand without compromising 99.99% availability.

## 1 Introduction
Fiber cuts are significant disruptions in Wide-Area Networks (WANs) because each fiber carries several Tbps of traffic, and repairs can take a long time. Our analysis of failure tickets at Facebook shows that fiber cuts account for 67% of total downtime, with 50% of these events taking over nine hours to repair (Section 2).

Today, service providers mitigate the loss of capacity caused by fiber cuts through over-provisioning, pre-allocating extra capacity for failover paths using failure-aware Traffic Engineering (TE) and optical path protection. However, this approach is expensive. A more cost-effective solution is to reconfigure the wavelengths from cut fibers to healthy ones, allowing the associated router ports and transponders to continue carrying traffic. This concept, known as optical restoration, was proposed two decades ago but has not been widely deployed due to several challenges.

Our measurements of a global WAN with over 200,000 IP links and 1,000 optical fiber links show that 62% of fiber cuts require partial restoration because the remaining fibers do not have enough available spectrum to host all the wavelengths of the cut fiber. Therefore, a practical restoration system must choose which IP links to restore and by how much.

We demonstrate that simply maximizing the restored bandwidth from the optical layer‚Äôs perspective, without considering IP links‚Äô traffic demand, leads to sub-optimal throughput. Hence, an IP/optical cross-layer TE is needed to ensure the partially restored capacity is efficiently utilized to match the current traffic demand.

However, current TE schemes do not consider optical restoration for fiber cuts. Instead, they treat fiber cuts as fatal events. To incorporate partial restoration into TE, we propose ARROW (Agile RestoRation of Optical Wavelengths). ARROW addresses both algorithmic and system-level challenges, such as finding the best partial restoration plan and reducing the end-to-end restoration latency.

ARROW's TE formulation accounts for partial restoration candidates during hypothetical fiber cut scenarios and plans according to the best restoration plan proactively. It solves this problem in a two-stage approach:
1. **Offline Analysis**: Identifies potential restoration candidates (LotteryTickets) without considering instantaneous traffic demand.
2. **Online TE Formulation**: Solves for the current traffic demand to find the winning LotteryTicket for each hypothetical fiber cut scenario, enabling the network to react quickly.

An important practical consideration is the end-to-end reconfiguration latency. While Reconfigurable Optical Add Drop Multiplexers (ROADMs) are widely deployed, reconfiguring wavelengths causes optical power instability, leading to packet loss until amplifiers adjust their gain, a process that takes several minutes. ARROW leverages Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) noise sources to bypass this reconfiguration time, reducing the end-to-end restoration latency to eight seconds.

To evaluate ARROW, we built a production-level testbed with 4 ROADM sites, 34 amplifiers, and over 2000 km of fiber, emulating part of our production backbone. Our testbed demonstrates the feasibility of reconfiguring 2.8 Tbps IP capacity (14 wavelengths) within eight seconds. Extensive simulations show that ARROW supports 2.0√ó‚Äì2.4√ó more demand without compromising 99.99% availability, while requiring 2.8√ó fewer router ports and optical transponders.

## 2 Background and Measurements
To motivate our work, we investigate the impact of fiber cuts in a subset of Facebook‚Äôs WAN, which includes more than 200,000 IP links and 10,000 optical wavelengths traversing 1,000 optical fiber cables across the world.

### 2.1 Overview
Figure 1 illustrates the mapping between IP links and optical wavelengths in Facebook. Several router ports are grouped into one port-channel, representing an IP link and carrying several Tbps of traffic via multiple wavelengths. Flows are load-balanced across all interfaces of a port-channel. The aggregation device aggregates multiple grey router ports into tunable Dense Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (DWDM) transponders. ROADMs can dynamically reconfigure wavelengths to map to any fiber, but this feature presents challenges.

When a fiber is cut, the associated router ports and transponders become idle until the fiber is repaired. However, healthy fibers can be used to reconfigure the wavelengths traversing the cut fiber. For example, if fiber 2 is cut, IP link 2 goes down, causing wavelengths ùúÜ3 to ùúÜ6 and their corresponding transponders and router ports to become idle. Our goal is to reconfigure these idle wavelengths on fiber 1 and/or fiber 3, referred to as surrogate fibers. The decision of which surrogate fiber to choose and how much capacity to restore depends on several factors discussed later in the paper.

Figure 2 presents a high-level example of ARROW in action. The top row shows the network in a healthy state, with the middle column representing the mapping between the optical and IP layers. The purple IP link between A and C in Figures 2(b) and (c) is configured to pass light entirely in the optical domain, making it appear as a direct IP link from the IP layer‚Äôs perspective.

The second row in Figure 2 shows the status of the network after a fiber cut without ARROW. IP1 and IP2 become unavailable, and the IP layer operates with reduced capacity. In contrast, ARROW (third row) restores the IP-layer view by reconfiguring the wavelengths corresponding to IP1 and IP2 to traverse healthy fibers.

### 2.2 Impact of Fiber Cuts on IP Capacity
We studied 600 WAN-related failure tickets at Facebook over three years (March 2016‚ÄìJune 2019). Figure 3(a) shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the mean time to repair for all tickets categorized by their root cause. It indicates that 50% of fiber cut events last longer than nine hours, and 10% last over a day. Figure 3(b) shows the percentage of downtime for each category, with fiber cuts accounting for 67% of the total downtime.

Fiber cuts can occur due to various reasons, including accidental damage, extreme weather, and animal interference. To quantify the impact on IP-layer capacity, we analyzed fiber-related failure tickets. On average, 16 fiber cut events happen every month. Given that Facebook‚Äôs datacenter sites have multiple fibers between them, a fiber cut will reduce some capacity between site-pairs.

Figure 4(a) shows the time series of lost capacity between four site-pairs that suffered the most capacity loss between 2017 and 2018. Each peak represents a fiber cut, resulting in several Tbps of capacity loss. Figure 4(b) shows the CDF of lost capacity on all IP links caused by fiber cuts during the entire three years of our measurement. Each fiber cut event resulted in the loss of up to 8 Tbps of IP capacity, motivating us to investigate the potential of wavelength reconfiguration for restoration.
