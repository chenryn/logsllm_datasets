# Group Key Exchange Protocol without a Designated Group Manager

## 4.2. Unmanaged Groups

Centrally managed groups present several challenges:
1. **Single Point of Attack**: The group manager is a single point of failure, as it holds the group key and shared secrets with all members.
2. **Trust in Key Generation and Distribution**: The group manager is trusted to generate and distribute all group keys, which may not be suitable for many applications.
3. **Managerial Inflexibility**: The group manager cannot easily leave the group, as there would be no one left to manage it.

To address these issues, a family of group key exchange protocols (e.g., [12, 11]) has been developed to allow all members to equally participate in key generation, ensuring that all members are equally trusted. Our framework aims to authenticate this class of protocols as well.

### Modified Difﬁe-Hellman Key Exchange
Most group key-exchange protocols use a modified version of the Difﬁe-Hellman key exchange among group members [12, 11]. However, similar to the two-party Difﬁe-Hellman, while a shared secret can be established, the identity of the other party is not always known. These protocols typically assume that all group members participate in a shared public key infrastructure or have previously exchanged public keys [12].

Using pre-authentication over location-limited channels, these assumptions can be relaxed. A broadcast location-limited channel can be used to allow all group participants to publicly commit to their public keys. Group members can then proceed with their chosen group key exchange protocol over the wireless link using these authenticated keys. Figure 7 illustrates an example of such an exchange.

#### Asynchronous Joining and Key Revocation
Group members who join asynchronously can broadcast their key commitments over the location-limited channel to the rest of the group as they arrive. A randomly selected current group member can respond, ensuring mutual authentication. The chosen group key exchange protocol handles the details of updating the shared group key for new members and revoking keys of departing members.

## 5. Implementation

We have started experimenting with these protocols as part of a larger project investigating new paradigms for usable security. We have implemented the basic protocols in Java, providing a flexible substrate for exploring various pre-authentication methods discussed in this paper.

### Software Framework
We have built a software framework for using pre-authentication data to authenticate arbitrary key exchange protocols. This framework allows dynamic choice of the medium used for the location-limited channel, the public key algorithm for key commitments, and the final authenticated key exchange protocol over the wireless link. It assumes only a TCP/IP socket, enabling pre-authentication data to be used to authenticate secure connections over both wired and wireless networks.

Extending the framework to support a new location-limited channel type or a new key exchange protocol involves implementing a Java interface to provide a small amount of syntactic "glue." The framework includes both client and server components, offering developers the option to control data exchange at a low level step-by-step or to use simpler, higher-level interfaces. For instance, these interfaces provide server threads that can manage pre-authentication of multiple clients over the location-limited channel and control how pre-authentication data is used to authenticate those clients over the wireless link (e.g., serially or in a multicast configuration).

### Example Scenario
An example scenario using this framework involves a client (such as our email gizmo) initiating an authenticated channel, and a responding server. The server listens for connections on both the location-limited channel and the primary link, but only admits primary-link connections from clients who have performed pre-authentication on the location-limited channel.

We currently use IrDA [9] as the medium for the location-limited channel and are in the process of constructing a contact-mediated interface, with plans to expand to group authentication using audio. The client opens an IrDA connection to the server (generating an error if more than one potential IrDA endpoint is discovered). Over this connection, client and server exchange XML-encoded pre-authentication data containing a commitment to an ephemeral DSA public key, a "friendly name," and an IP address and port on which the server will be listening. This results in a payload of about 300 bytes in each direction, incurring minimal time overhead even on low-bandwidth channels.

With pre-authentication complete, the IR channel is closed, and the client extracts the server’s IP address and port number from the received data. The client then opens a normal SSL/TLS connection to the server on the primary link. Both sides use the information gained in the pre-authentication step (commitments to the public keys) to authenticate the newly opened channel. The client and server can now securely exchange any information over the primary (wireless) link.

## 6. Related Work

Our work addresses the problem of bootstrapping trust in networked environments. Traditional solutions (e.g., X.509 [7]) link a target to cryptographic information through out-of-band mechanisms, which are often inappropriate for wireless ad-hoc networks due to heavy setup and online server requirements.

### Trust and Key Management
Several approaches to trust and key management use out-of-band channels to authenticate key exchanges. For example, PGP’s web of trust [21] involves users obtaining public keys from insecure sources and verifying them through out-of-band communication (e.g., phone, mail, face-to-face conversation). Our approach uses the exchange of pre-authentication data for demonstrative identification and automatic authentication, whereas PGP links keys to email addresses and adds manual key authentication as a separate step.

### Ad-Hoc Wireless Networks
Recent proposals address bootstrapping trust in ad-hoc wireless networks. Bluetooth [3], in its most secure configuration, requires a PIN to bootstrap the first communication, which is burdensome for users and plagued by security flaws [10]. WEP, the link-layer security protocol for 802.11 [8], also has usability and security issues. Our proposal is more user-friendly and secure, relying on well-known and tested protocols for key exchange.

Stajano and Anderson [18] proposed the Resurrecting Duckling security model for secure transient associations in ad-hoc wireless networks. They suggest using a contact channel to establish a shared secret between a master and a slave device. Stajano later extended this model to peer-to-peer interactions [17]. Our work extends theirs by providing concrete details on the data exchanged and how to combine it with data sent over the wireless link. We use public key cryptography to take advantage of a wider range of privileged channel types and well-established key exchange protocols.

### Location-Limited Channels
Outside the security domain, location-limited channels have been used for accessing devices and services demonstratively. For example, Satchel/MobileDoc [15] from XRCE allows users to retrieve documents and "beam" them to printers or other PDAs. HP’s Cooltown project [13] uses infrared to send URLs of entities in a user’s surroundings. These efforts recognize the usability advantages of demonstrative identification but do not address security. Our proposal provides a way to add security seamlessly without increasing the demand on the user.

## 7. Conclusions

In this paper, we presented new schemes for peer-to-peer authentication in ad-hoc wireless networks. Building on previous work by Stajano, Anderson, and others, we explained how to use demonstrative identification for pre-authentication over location-limited channels. Our schemes do not require a public key infrastructure and solve the naming problem in traditional authentication systems. Key novel aspects include:

- **Use of Location-Limited Channels**: We propose using location-limited channels to bootstrap a wide range of key-exchange protocols.
- **Novel Location-Limited Channels**: We explore new media for location-limited channels, such as audio, infrared, and contact-based channels.
- **Concrete Pre-Authentication Protocols**: We provide a concrete recipe for augmenting existing key exchange protocols with a pre-authentication step.
- **Group Communication**: We employ broadcast characteristics of some media to pre-authenticate group communication over location-limited channels.
- **No Reliance on Public Key Infrastructure**: Our pre-authentication protocols can be used in place of a PKI when communicating parties are within close physical proximity.
