## Introduction
- **SAP Overview:**
  - SAP is a leading provider of business software.
  - Sensitive enterprise processes are often managed through SAP systems.
  - SAP security has become a critical concern.
  - Some components still lack comprehensive coverage.
  - Proprietary protocols are used in various SAP components.

- **Diag Protocol:**
  - The Dynamic Information and Action Gateway (Diag) protocol, also known as the "SAP GUI protocol."
  - It serves as the link between the presentation layer (SAP GUI) and the application layer (SAP Netweaver).
  - Present in every SAP NW ABAP AS.
  - Compressed but unencrypted by default.
  - Operates on TCP ports 3200 to 3298.

## Motivation and Related Work
- **Previous Research:**
  - Most previous work focused on decompression.
  - The inner workings of the Diag protocol remain largely unknown.
  - No practical tools for penetration testing exist.

- **Motivation:**
  - Limited understanding of the Diag protocol.
  - Only 2 out of approximately 2300 security fixes published by SAP since 2009 have addressed Diag-related components.

## SAP Netweaver Architecture and Protocols Layout
- **SAP Netweaver Architecture:**
  - Key concepts and components:
    - **ABAP:** SAP's programming language.
    - **Dispatcher and Work Processes (WP):**
      - Dispatcher: Distributes user requests across WPs.
      - Work Processes: Handle specific tasks (e.g., dialog, spool, update, background, lock).
    - **Dialog Processing:** A programming method used by ABAP that separates business programs into screens and dialog steps.

- **SAP Protocols Layout:**
  - **Proprietary Protocols:**
    - NI (Network Interface) Protocol
    - RFC (Remote Function Call)
    - Diag Protocol
    - Router
    - BAPI (Business Application Programming Interface)
  - **Standard Protocols:**
    - HTTP
    - SOAP
    - SSL

## Dissecting and Understanding the Diag Protocol
- **Approach:**
  - Black-box analysis.
  - No binary reverse engineering techniques were used.
  - System/developer traces enabled (GUI/app server).
  - Network and application traces analyzed.
  - Interaction with components (GUI/app server) to learn more.
  - Continuous improvement of test tools based on gained knowledge.

- **Protocol Structure:**
  - **NI (Network Interface) Protocol:**
    - DP Header (optional)
    - Diag Header
    - Compression Header (optional)
    - Payload (Diag Items)

- **Initialization:**
  - Two relevant protocol states: Not initialized and Initialized.
  - User context assigned in shared memory.
  - Started by the GUI application.
  - First packet is always uncompressed.

- **DP Header:**
  - 200 bytes long.
  - Two different semantics: IPC (inter-process communication) and Network.
  - Relevant fields: Terminal name, Length.
  - Only present during initialization (first packet).

- **Diag Header:**
  - Identifies different sessions using the same channel.
  - Compression and encryption flags.
  - Message type, info, and return code.

- **Compression:**
  - Enabled by default.
  - Uses Lempel-Ziv Adaptive Compression Algorithms (LZH and LZC).
  - Can be disabled by setting the `TDW_NOCOMPRESS` environment variable.

- **Payload:**
  - Various fixed and variable-length items (SES, ICO, TIT, DiagMessage, OKC, CHL, SBA, APPL/APPL4, etc.).

- **Security Highlights:**
  - Protocol version can disable compression.
  - Authentication performed as a regular dialog step.
  - Embedded RFC calls carried in both directions.

## Results and Findings
- **Packet Dissection:**
  - Wireshark plug-in written in C/C++.
  - Supports NI Protocol, Router Protocol, and Diag protocol dissection.
  - Decompression, DP header, Diag Header, and Compression Header dissection.
  - Identification and dissection of relevant Diag items.
  - RFC protocol dissector with basic coverage.

- **Packet Crafting:**
  - Scapy classes for SAPNi, SAPDiagDP, SAPDiag, and SAPDiagItem.
  - Proof-of-concept and example scripts for information gathering, login brute force, proxy/MITM, and Diag server.

- **Fuzzing Approach:**
  - Fuzzing scheme using Scapy classes, test case generation, delivery, and monitoring.
  - Windbg, XMLRPC, and synchronization for monitoring all work processes.

- **Vulnerabilities Found:**
  - 6 vulnerabilities released in May 2012 affecting SAP NW 7.01/7.02.
  - Fix available in SAP Note 168710.
  - Unauthenticated remote denial of service (CVE-2012-2511, CVE-2012-2512, CVE-2012-2612, CVE-2012-2513, CVE-2012-2514).
  - Unauthenticated remote code execution (CVE-2012-2611) with stack-based buffer overflow.

- **Attack Scenarios:**
  - Targeting application servers: Exploit mentioned CVEs, gather server information, and perform login brute force.
  - Targeting GUI users: Inject RFC calls, gather credentials, and perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

## Defenses and Countermeasures
- **Network Access:**
  - Restrict access to dispatcher service (TCP ports 3200-3298).
  - Use application layer gateways.

- **Encryption:**
  - Implement SNC client encryption for authentication and encryption.
  - Available for free at SAP Marketplace (SAP Note 1643878).

- **GUI Shortcuts:**
  - Restrict use of GUI shortcuts (disabled by default in SAP GUI > 7.20, see SAP Note 1397000).

- **WebGUI:**
  - Use WebGUI with HTTPS (SAP Note 314568).

- **Patching:**
  - Regularly patch (Patch Tuesday, RSECNOTE program, SAP Note 888889).
  - Patch CVEs affecting Diag (see CORE’s advisory and SAP Note 168710).

- **Testing:**
  - Regularly test the system for vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion and Future Work
- **Conclusion:**
  - Detailed protocol information now available to the security community.
  - Practical tools for dissection and crafting of protocol messages published.
  - New vectors for testing and assessing SAP environments.
  - Discussed countermeasures and defenses.

- **Future Work:**
  - Security assessment and fuzzing of GUI/app server.
  - Complete dissection of embedded RFC calls.
  - Full implementation of attack scenarios.
  - Integration with external libraries and exploitation tools.
  - Security assessment of SNC and coverage of encrypted traffic.
