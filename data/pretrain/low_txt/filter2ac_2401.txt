**ATT&CK ID:** T1072  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Software Deployment Tools

Adversaries may exploit third-party software suites, such as administration, monitoring, and deployment systems, that are installed within an enterprise network to facilitate lateral movement. These third-party applications and software deployment systems, including tools like Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), McAfee Host-Based Security System (HBSS), and Symantec Altiris, are often used for administrative purposes in the network environment. By gaining access to these tools, adversaries can leverage their existing permissions and capabilities to move laterally through the network, potentially compromising additional systems.
