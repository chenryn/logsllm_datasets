# History-based Access Control for XML Documents

## Abstract
In recent years, the transition from paper to electronic documents has brought about numerous advantages but also new risks. Electronic documents are more susceptible to theft and accidental deletion compared to their paper counterparts. To mitigate these risks, access control mechanisms have been developed to restrict access to only necessary users. This thesis focuses on a history-based access control model for XML documents, which are widely used due to their technical advantages.

Traditional access control methods define access rights for each object individually, which is error-prone and time-consuming. Advanced approaches derive access rights from the properties of objects, typically using their content. However, this thesis introduces the concept of "History," which records the creation and modification processes of objects. By incorporating this history, the access control model can more precisely define access rights based on the origin, creator, and previous content of the document.

This work presents a comprehensive model, system architecture, and security mechanisms for history-based access control in XML documents.
