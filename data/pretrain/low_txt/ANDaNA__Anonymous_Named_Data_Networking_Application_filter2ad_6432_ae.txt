### 6. Implementation and Performance

ANDaNA is implemented as an application-level service, consisting of a client "stack" (used by consumers) and a server program that runs on ANDaNA Anonymity Routers (ARs). Both components are written in C and interface with NDN through Unix domain sockets. Cryptographic algorithms are implemented using OpenSSL [42]. Hybrid encryption is achieved using RSA-OAEP [10] and AES+HMAC [15, 7], with the latter also used for symmetric encryption. We use SHA-256 for HMAC and 1024-bit and 128-bit keys for RSA and AES, respectively. Loose time synchronization between ANDaNA clients and servers is achieved using pool.ntp.org, a public pool of NTP servers.

The ANDaNA client encrypts interests from user applications. To hide all possible sources of de-anonymizing information, encryption is performed over the entire interest packet, including the name, scope, exclusion filters, and duplicate suppression string fields. Following NDN rules, ANDaNA ARs announce the ability to serve the root ("/") namespace and receive all traffic sent to or from the local NDN routing process. This allows traffic to be routed through ANDaNA by default, requiring no changes to existing applications. For more granular control, consumers can specify a different namespace, such as "/andana/". However, this would require privacy-seeking applications to explicitly direct their traffic to that namespace, similar to configurable proxy settings.

ANDaNA servers run as applications on NDN routers. Each server is responsible for its relay and session creation namespaces. The relay namespace is a globally routable namespace used for receiving both session-based and asymmetrically encrypted Interests. Clients using session-based encryption in ANDaNA must first establish symmetric keys with servers. To start a new session, a client sends an interest in the `createsession` namespace, which is registered by the server code as a sub-prefix of the relay namespace.

We deployed our prototype and conducted a series of tests on the Open Network Laboratory (ONL) [34]. ONL is a testbed developed by Washington University to enable the experimental evaluation of advanced networking concepts in a realistic environment. To ensure highly reproducible results, ONL provides reservation-based exclusive access to most of its host and network resources. All our experiments used single-core Linux machines with 512 MB of RAM and gigabit switches (one machine per switch).

We compared plain NDN and ANDaNA on a simple line topology with four switches and four Linux machines, each corresponding to an NDN node. Static routing was established between nodes. The first NDN node in the line topology acted as a consumer and ran `ccngetfile`, a small tool from the CCNx open-source library that retrieves data published as NDN content and stores it in a local file. We performed tests with 1, 10, and 100 MB files; each file was retrieved from the NDN repository of the machine at the other end of the line topology. Results for 10 MB files are summarized in Figure 1. Due to space constraints, all file retrieval results are illustrated in Appendix B. The results show that the computational overhead introduced by ANDaNA roughly doubles download times over plain NDN, assuming an almost-perfect world where ARs topologically align with the best path and link bandwidths are abundant.

To compare ANDaNA's computational overhead with a similar anonymizing tool, we deployed Tor over ONL and measured its overhead over TCP/IP. We measured the performance of TCP/IP baseline using five switches connected in a line and two Linux machines (one at each end): the first acting as a client (running `curl`), and the second as a server (running `lighttpd` HTTP server). Tor's performance was measured on a topology that closely mimics the TCP/IP baseline: five switches connecting three Tor relays, a client, and a server. To ensure a "line" topology, the Tor client was configured to use explicit entry and exit nodes, and DNS lookups were avoided by using IP addresses in all tests.

Before discussing the results, we mention some comparison details. NDN is a research project, and its code is optimized for functionality rather than performance. It provides content authentication through digital signatures, a computationally expensive feature not present in either TCP/IP or Tor. The NDN stack currently runs as a user-space application, in contrast to TCP/IP, which runs in kernel space. Finally, in all our experiments, NDN had to run on top of TCP/IP (rather than at layer 2) due to limitations of the underlying ONL testbed. Consequently, we believe a fair comparison between ANDaNA and Tor can only be achieved by focusing the analysis on the relative overhead imposed by each, over the network it is deployed on, i.e., NDN and TCP/IP, respectively.

Figure 1 shows the Round-Trip Time (RTT) for 10 MB of content over NDN (limited anonymity) and ANDaNA (full anonymity). Figure 2 compares the download times for 1, 10, and 100 MB files over Tor, ANDaNA-S (session-based), and ANDaNA-A (asymmetric encryption) with respect to their baselines. The left graph includes the time required to set up a Tor circuit and all ephemeral circuits for ANDaNA. For small to medium-sized files (1-10 MB), the overhead of ANDaNA-A is between 1.5× and 1.75×. As expected, ANDaNA-S exhibits lower overhead (1.45× to 1.7×) due to more efficient symmetric encryption. In comparison, Tor's download time for the same amount of data is between 2.3 and 7 times higher than that of TCP/IP, imposing significant overhead for content sizes that fit many typical web pages. ANDaNA is more efficient in anonymizing such traffic patterns. Large file transfers are more efficient with Tor, which increases the total download time by about 1.4 times, compared to 2.4 and 2.1 times for ANDaNA-A and ANDaNA-S, respectively.

The right-side graph in Figure 2 shows the relative speed of the three approaches without including circuit setup time. Our measurements show that the overhead of ephemeral circuit creation in ANDaNA-S is negligible. Since a new ephemeral circuit must be selected for every interest with ANDaNA-A, we report the same values from the previous graph. Results confirm that the overhead of circuit creation in Tor is significant when retrieving small-size content. Removing this initialization phase from the measurements significantly reduces Tor's overhead. However, the overhead of ANDaNA with respect to its baseline is still smaller than that of Tor for content up to 10 MB.

In absolute terms (comparing raw download times), Tor + TCP/IP performs better than ANDaNA + NDN in our testbed experiments. However, we believe that in a realistic, geographically-distributed deployment setting with limited-bandwidth links, ANDaNA + NDN would provide a significant performance advantage over Tor + TCP/IP due to its shorter (ephemeral) circuits. In other words, we anticipate that shorter circuits and content caching in ANDaNA + NDN would result in appreciably lower overall download times than Tor + TCP/IP in a global internet setting.

### 7. Conclusions and Future Work

Content-centric networking (CCN) represents a major transition from today's endpoint-focused networking. The NDN project is one of the most visible current research efforts aiming to bring CCN into the foreground as a possible future Internet architecture. Despite some privacy-friendly features and side effects, NDN poses interesting privacy challenges. This work presents an initial attempt to provide anonymity in NDN. The main contributions of this work are threefold: (1) exploration of privacy issues in NDN, (2) design of an anonymization tool—ANDaNA, and (3) its security analysis and performance assessment.

Since the entire NDN project (and, of course, ANDaNA) represent work-in-progress, one of the main goals of this paper is to solicit comments from the security research community. Additionally, since our work merely scratches the surface of privacy issues in CCN and NDN, several issues are left for future work, including:

- More performance experimentation with ANDaNA, especially in larger testbeds and under various traffic load/congestion scenarios. (This should lead to better code profiling and lower overhead.)
- A comprehensive directory service for effective large-scale distribution of up-to-date AR information.
- An in-depth study of both privacy and performance trade-offs in the use of asymmetric vs. symmetric ANDaNA variants.
- DoS mitigation measures, such as computational puzzles for circuit establishment.
- Red-teaming experiments to assess the realistic privacy attainable with ANDaNA.
- Modification of ANDaNA to support other emerging content-centric architectures and comparative experiments among them.
