### Collusion

In §IV-C, the analysis of RESIP traffic revealed that RESIP service providers Proxies Online and Geosurf shared 9 potentially unwanted programs (PUPs). This section further investigates the relationships among different RESIP service providers in terms of their shared RESIPs. We calculate the intersection rate (\(\frac{|A \cap B|}{|A|}\)) between the RESIPs captured from different service providers and define a stringent criterion to determine if a RESIP can be considered shared by two providers. Specifically, a RESIP is deemed shared only if it has been captured in the same hour by independent infiltrations on both providers' services.

As shown in Figure 8(c), we found several RESIPs spanning multiple RESIP service providers. The most popular provider, Luminati, shares 813 RESIPs with Proxies Online, 983 with Geosurf, 2,783 with IAPS Security, and 1,718 with ProxyRack. Given the significant overlap in RESIPs between Proxies Online and Geosurf, they are likely two brands of the same company. Additionally, IAPS is probably a reseller of Luminati, as most of its RESIP IPs originate from Luminati.

### Infrastructure Profiling

After identifying the infrastructure of RESIP services, including frontend websites/gateways and backend gateways, we conducted further profiling to find potential features for detecting these infrastructures. To this end, we first collected the IPs associated with these infrastructures by sending DNS queries from multiple locations to 48 identified domains, resulting in 915 IPs. We then performed periodic port scanning on these IPs and found that frontend and backend gateways tend to open many consecutive ports.

Specifically, Luminati has ports 23000-23999, 52225, and 52951 open for frontend gateways and ports 6861-7009 for backend gateways. Geosurf/Proxies Online have ports 8010-8237 for frontend gateways and port 11211 for backend gateways. ProxyRack opens ports 1200-1250 and 1500-1750 for frontend gateways. We also randomly scanned the IPs of popular web services and found that none of them open such unusual ports. These ports are related to different proxy services provided by ProxyRack and Geosurf/Proxies Online. However, the specific use of these consecutive ports by Luminati remains unclear.

### Case Study: Luminati

Luminati claims to be a network where users voluntarily contribute their network resources by installing client software such as browser extensions or Hola VPN. When we purchased their service, Luminati indeed performed a background check, requesting photo ID and explaining their traffic policy through a video chat (though only crawling Google is explicitly forbidden). Surprisingly, our findings indicate that Luminati:

1. Proxies through IoT devices that do not support Hola client software.
2. Likely resells services to other providers like IAPS, which conduct no background checks.
3. Involves RESIPs that host malicious content or are associated with suspicious domains.

Using our IP profiling infrastructure described in §III-A, we performed real-time device fingerprinting for newly captured RESIPs from Luminati and identified numerous IoT devices associated with Luminati's RESIPs, including webcams (4.31%), DVRs (1.93%), printers (0.13%), VoIP devices (0.09%), and NAS (1.24%). Since Luminati does not provide Hola clients for these types of devices, our findings contradict their claim of a network consisting solely of willing participants. Instead, IoT devices appear to be a significant source of RESIPs for Luminati.

Our findings in §IV-C and §V-B suggest that IAPS likely resells Luminati’s RESIP service. The PUP traffic logs show that our infiltration traffic from IAPS proxies was relayed by Hola clients controlled by Luminati. Furthermore, 66% of the RESIPs captured from IAPS were also discovered by our infiltration targeting Luminati during the same hour. IAPS conducts no background checks, accepts various payment methods including Bitcoin, and imposes no traffic restrictions. This allows IAPS users to potentially abuse Luminati’s network, even to the point of denying services for legitimate Luminati customers. We also found that 2.32% of Luminati’s RESIPs hosted malicious content or had suspicious domains resolved to them while acting as proxies. Examples include the scam site tummytickle.com and the drive-by-download site www.iwys.cc, with malicious samples including PUPs, Trojans, and exploit code.

### Discussion

#### Mitigation

Our measurements have identified numerous security issues, including compromised devices and the abuse of RESIP services for malicious activities. A key prerequisite for mitigating these issues is effective detection of RESIP services and RESIPs, which we plan to pursue in future work. We discuss potential features useful for detection.

1. **Detecting RESIP Services**: 
   - **Websites**: RESIP websites typically contain keywords such as "residential IP," "never blocked," and "HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS," which can be used by search engines or forum crawlers for automated content analysis.
   - **Frontend Gateways**: Often co-located with RESIP websites, sharing domain names or IP addresses. As described in §V, frontend gateways tend to open a large number of TCP ports to serve traffic with various proxy requirements.
   - **Backend Gateways**: Features for detection include opening a large number of TCP ports, globally distributed sources of DNS queries for low-reputation domains, and being co-located directly or indirectly with frontend gateways.

2. **Detecting RESIPs**:
   - Discovering RESIPs can be facilitated using detected backend gateways as "stepping stones" since RESIPs must communicate with these gateways.
   - The visiting patterns and targeted domains of traffic relayed by RESIPs may deviate from normal traffic, which can be considered in a detection scheme.

#### Datasets and Code Release

We will release related datasets and source code, as detailed in Appendix IX-C.

### Related Work

#### Dark Web Proxy

The security issues surrounding web proxy services have garnered increasing attention from researchers. Weaver et al. [81] conducted a measurement study to understand the purpose of free proxy services based on how they modify traffic. Chung et al. [58] studied a paid proxy service to uncover content manipulation in end-to-end connections. O’Neill et al. [72] measured the prevalence of TLS proxies and identified thousands of malware intercepting TLS communications. Carnavalet et al. [62] released security vulnerabilities in TLS proxies, allowing attackers to mount man-in-the-middle attacks. Recently, [80] and [73] showed the content modification behavior of Open HTTP proxy services and free HTTP/HTTPS proxy services.

In contrast to the above studies on web proxies and content manipulation, our research focuses on an emerging online gray business, RESIP services, and specifically on the abused RESIPs as attack intermediaries and collusive RESIP service providers.

#### Compromised Host Detection

The detection of compromised hosts has been a long-standing area of research. Techniques have been developed to analyze web content, redirection chains, and traffic patterns. For example, Borgolte et al. [56] developed a system to monitor the evolution of web content to identify infections using signatures generated from modifications. Other studies, such as JsRED [69], use differential analysis to automatically detect malicious redirect scripts. Shady Path [79] captures compromised hosts by analyzing their redirection graphs. Many studies also use traffic analysis via active or passive probing to detect compromised hosts. Our study performs best-effort identification and characterization of RESIPs using novel methods and compares RESIPs to other types of compromised hosts, revealing several challenges in accurately detecting RESIPs on today’s Internet.

#### Empirical Study of Botnets

Botnets have been extensively studied. For instance, Abu Rajab et al. [53] revealed structural and behavioral features of botnets, such as high churn rates. Collins et al. [60] studied the relationship between botnets and spamming activities. Zandbergen et al. [78] characterized the personal data theft behavior of the Torpig botnet. In contrast, our study focuses on RESIP services, which exhibit different characteristics from botnets in terms of hosts, users, and network behaviors, as detailed in §IV-D.

### Conclusion

RESIP services represent an emerging online gray business whose security implications have not been previously studied. In this paper, we report the first systematic research on this new service, using a suite of techniques to address the challenges in collecting RESIP host information and identifying illicit activities. Through infiltrating five representative services, we gathered over 6.2 million RESIP IPs and successfully profiled more than 500K hosts, identifying more than 200K IoT devices likely to be compromised to serve as proxies. By linking these IPs to PUP traffic data provided by our industry partner, we gained a rare insight into the operations of these residential proxies. Our study shows that RESIPs are often involved in illicit activities such as blackhat SEO, fast fluxing, phishing, and malware hosting. Our infiltration analysis also uncovered the hidden layer of their infrastructure and the collusion across different services. Unregulated RESIP services pose new threats to Internet users, and further research is needed to gain a more comprehensive view of these services and develop effective solutions to mitigate their security risks.
