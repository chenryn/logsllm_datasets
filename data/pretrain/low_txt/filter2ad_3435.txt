## 1. Introduction
The increasing power and interconnectivity of modern computer systems have enabled the storage and processing of vast amounts of data, making information accessible from anywhere at any time. This has led to an enhanced ability to collect, exchange, access, process, and link information. Consequently, there is growing awareness and concern about privacy issues, which have become a subject of public debate. The need for privacy-aware policies, regulations, and techniques is now widely recognized.
