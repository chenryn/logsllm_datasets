## Context for the Problem

All client virtual machines (VMs) in a multi-tenant environment are connected to a virtual version of a physical networking device. This raises the question: do Layer 2 network attacks that typically work on physical devices also apply to their virtualized counterparts?

### Key Points:
- Cloud services that rely on virtualized environments could be vulnerable.
- This includes data centers hosting mission-critical or sensitive data.
- These are not the only types of attacks from co-located VMs.
- An old lesson: you are vulnerable to those close to you.

## Key Question
What if a malicious tenant successfully launches a Layer 2 network attack within a multi-tenant environment?

### Consequences:
- Capture all network traffic.
- Redirect traffic.
- Perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
- Denial of Service (DoS).
- Gain unauthorized access to restricted sub-networks.
- Affect performance.

## Bottom Line
Our research demonstrates that virtualized network devices can be exploited in the same manner as physical devices. In some cases, these attacks can even leave the virtualized network and affect the physical networks they are connected to.

## Test Scenarios & Results

### Old Test Environment
- Built from salvaged components (RIP – you served us well!).
- Full system specifications are available in the white paper on the DEF CON 23 CD and on the DEF CON Media Server.

### New Environment
- Funded with $30K (thanks to Utica College).

#### New Hardware Specifications
- 1U SuperMicro server system.
- CPU: Intel Xeon X3-1240V3 Quad Core w/ Hyper-Threading.
- RAM: 32GB.
- Hard Drive: 500GB WD Enterprise 7200RPM SATA.
- 4 on-board Intel Gigabit network interface cards.

### MAC Flooding Attack
- Performance updates.
- Network diagram and performance metrics for Gentoo/Xen Bridged Interface and other platforms, including Cisco 2950 control.

### VLAN Hopping
- Used to gain unauthorized access to another Virtual LAN (VLAN) on a packet-switched network.
- Attacker sends frames from one VLAN to another that would otherwise be inaccessible.
- Two methods:
  - **Switch Spoofing**: Exploits Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) and Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP).
  - **Double Tagging**: Exploits the 802.1Q standard.

#### Switch Spoofing
- **CVE-2005-1942**: Bypasses port security via spoofed CDP messages.
- **CVE-1999-1129**: Injects 802.1q frames into another VLAN by forging the VLAN identifier.
- **Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)**: Allows automatic configuration of trunk ports on Cisco switches.

#### Double Tagging
- **CVE-2005-4440**: Bypasses network segmentation and spoofs VLAN traffic via a message with two 802.1q tags.
- **Consequences**: Attacker can send packets to a target VLAN, but the targeted system cannot respond back. Excellent for DoS attacks and one-way covert channels.

### ARP Spoofing
- Layer 2 network protocol used to map physical MAC addresses to logical IP addresses within a broadcast domain.
- **ARP Process**: Initiating system sends a broadcast request to the entire Layer 2 network to discover the Layer 3 address of another node.
- **Man-In-The-Middle (MitM) Attack**: Attacker intercepts and modifies traffic between two parties.

#### ARP Spoofing Mitigation
- **Cisco Switches**: Use DHCP snooping and Dynamic ARP inspection.
- **arpwatch**: Linux utility that monitors the network for changes in ARP activity.

## Conclusion: Virtual vs. Physical?
- Virtual networking devices can pose the same or even greater risks than their physical counterparts.
- The vulnerability varies widely across different systems.
- Lack of sophisticated Layer 2 security controls increases the difficulty in securing virtual switches against these attacks.

### Bottom-line Impact
- A single malicious VM has the potential to sniff all traffic passing over a virtual switch, affecting physically connected devices and compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of data in a virtualized multi-tenant environment.

### What Can Users Do?
- Educated users should question their hosting providers about the virtual switch implementations and their vulnerabilities.
- Audit the risk of workloads in the cloud or within multi-tenant virtualized environments.
- Consider/request extra security measures, such as increased use of encryption, service monitoring, and threat detection.

### Next Steps for Us
- Small team with improvements this year but more to do.
- Institute for apples-to-apples testing of virtualized environments.
- Looking for industrial partners to participate.
- More testing in production environments.
- Need more students funded to do testing (good educational value).
