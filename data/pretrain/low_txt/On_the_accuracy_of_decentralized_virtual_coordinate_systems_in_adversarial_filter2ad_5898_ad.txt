### Protection Against Malicious Nodes in Smaller AMP Datasets

Our solution provides protection for smaller-scale AMP (Approximate Multidimensional Projection) datasets against malicious nodes. However, as shown in Fig. 8(c), the system becomes overwhelmed when the percentage of malicious nodes is high (≥ 30%). This occurs because, with a high percentage of malicious nodes, each benign node is likely to have many malicious nodes in its reference set.

For instance, if 30% of the total nodes are malicious, the probability that at least 30% of the nodes in a reference set of AMP are also malicious is approximately 67%. This probability is nearly double that of King or Meridian under the same conditions, due to AMP's much smaller size (see Table 1).

### Tolerance to Malicious Coalitions

All defense mechanisms and protocols resilient to insider attacks have limitations regarding the number of attackers they can tolerate. We analyze the number of malicious colluding nodes that our outlier detection mechanism can handle using a reference set size of 64. Table 4 presents the number of malicious nodes in a reference set that, by colluding, can influence the spatial centroid calculation enough to bypass the detection mechanism. Nearly twenty malicious nodes (or 30% of the reference set size) are required for most attack types across the three datasets.

The deflation attack is more successful for AMP because the Round-Trip Times (RTTs) are less variable, and the virtual coordinate system creates one main cluster (Fig. 1(c)) that contains all the nodes. This explains why high percentages of malicious nodes (≥ 30%) can overwhelm our solution in AMP scenarios. In these cases, benign nodes are likely to have twenty or more malicious nodes in their reference set, which can cause the spatial centroid to shift and allow malicious updates to pass undetected.

We conclude that our defense method works well when the size of the malicious coalition is smaller than one-third of the total number of nodes in the reference set. This bound is consistent with the performance of other methods that tolerate malicious insiders (e.g., [10]).

### System Overhead

Our defense mechanisms do not introduce additional link stress, as they utilize information already being exchanged between nodes. The memory utilization for spatial correlation requires maintaining the most recent \( u \) updates. For temporal outlier detection, the memory usage consists of maintaining the temporal centroid. By incrementally updating the centroid, we do not need to maintain the entire history for each probed node but only store the mean, standard deviation, and count for each metric. The additional computational complexity is bounded by the number of nodes in the reference set, which is constant. The computation of temporal and spatial outliers is a constant-time calculation performed at each node when it updates its coordinate.

### Related Work

#### Attacks in Virtual Coordinate Systems

One of the few systems to consider actual malicious behavior is the PIC (Practical Internet Coordinates) [12] virtual coordinate system, which uses a security test based on the triangle inequality. Any node violating the triangle inequality above a certain margin of error is designated as malicious. However, RTT measurements often violate this inequality [27, 53, 31], degrading system performance when no attack is occurring. Kaafar et al. demonstrate the susceptibility of Vivaldi to attacks [21, 22].

We recently became aware of [20], developed simultaneously and independently of our work, which employs a set of trusted nodes as a reference set to analyze all node behavior for malicious patterns. The key difference is that our method does not require a trusted component in the network.

#### Coordinate System Error and Landmark Selection

Minimizing error in the system is an important area of research. The accuracy of such systems is greatly affected by landmark placement for centralized schemes and neighbor selection in decentralized schemes. A hierarchical approach can lead to better performance over non-hierarchical solutions [49]. Works by Lua et al. [31] and Zhang et al. [50] propose new metrics and measurements to more accurately embed distances in the coordinate system. These areas provide opportunities for further research, as our work could leverage these new metrics to place further constraints on attackers and create a more robust, accurate, and fault-tolerant system.

#### Use of Spatial and Temporal Correlations

The benefits of the Mahalanobis distance for statistical anomaly detection have been demonstrated in the context of network intrusion detection [45, 26]. Jiang and Cybenko [18] use temporal and spatial correlations to detect attack scenarios using a large amount of information from intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and different software logs. Unlike this general approach, our work focuses on virtual coordinate systems.

Correlations have also been used in wireless networks for detecting attacks [6, 42]. Huang et al. [6] use correlations between different features to identify attacks against wireless ad hoc routing protocols, while Tanachaiwiwat and Helmy [42] show how to augment sensor networks with spatio-temporal correlations to detect misinformation. In our work, the correlation is incorporated in-line with the coordinate computation and analysis is performed on real Internet datasets.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we studied attacks against the accuracy of virtual coordinate systems. We classified the attacks as coordinate inflation, deflation, and oscillation, showing that even a small number of attackers can severely degrade coordinate accuracy due to the epidemic nature of the attacks. We proposed using spatial-temporal correlation to perform outlier detection on updates received from malicious nodes and eliminate them from the coordinate computation process. By using analytical and empirical methods, we found that a spatial threshold of 1.5 and a temporal threshold of 4 produced low system error and maintained an acceptable false positive rate. Finally, we examined the limitations of outlier detection when a significant percentage of nodes are malicious and found that the method starts degrading when more than 30% of the nodes in a reference set form a malicious coalition.

Future work includes analyzing the relationship between reference set size and system size and the effect of our mechanisms on upper-level applications using virtual coordinate systems to estimate network measurements.
