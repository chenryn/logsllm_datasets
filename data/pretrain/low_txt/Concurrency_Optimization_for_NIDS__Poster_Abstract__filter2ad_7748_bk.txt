### Overall Summary and Optimization

**Overall, 54 primary and 13 secondary metabolites were selected as significantly discriminant (VIP > 1, p < 0.05). The grain milling process significantly affected titratable acidity (DOM 0, 5 > DOM 7 > DOM 9, 11) and amino nitrogen content (DOM 5, 7 > DOM 0, 9, 11) in the koji. In conclusion, rice substrate preprocessing between DOM 5–7 was potentially ideal, resulting in a product rich in distinctive nutritional and functional metabolites. This study highlights the importance of grain preprocessing steps for commercial koji production.**

**P-335: Mass Spectrometry-Based Untargeted Metabolomics and Alpha-glucosidase Inhibitory Activity of Reishi (Ganoderma lingzhi) during Growth Stages**

**Presenting Author: Dedi Satria, Kyushu University, Japan**

**Co-Authors: Dedi Satria, Sonam Tamrakar, Hiroto Suhara, Shuhei Kaneko, Kuniyoshi Shimizu**

**Abstract:**
Reishi (Ganoderma lingzhi) is a mushroom species known for its wide range of bioactivities. Analyzing metabolite changes during different growth stages is crucial for understanding the biosynthesis and bioactivity mechanisms. This study used mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics to analyze metabolic alterations across eight growth stages, from mycelium to post-mature. GC-MS and LC-MS analyses, along with multivariate analysis, were performed. Key markers included amino acids, organic acids, sugars, polyols, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and lanostane-type triterpenoids. These markers were correlated with alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, indicating that certain metabolites are involved in both growth and bioactivity.

**P-336: Comprehensive Metabolomic Analysis of Sesame Seeds**

**Presenting Author: Bo Mi Lee, Kookmin University, South Korea**

**Co-Authors: Eun Mi Lee, Byeung Kon Shin, Dong Jin Kang, Do Yup Lee**

**Abstract:**
Sesame seeds are rich in amino acids, essential fatty acids, carbohydrates, and hydroxy acids. Their nutritional characteristics are influenced by environmental and genetic factors. This study analyzed the metabolic profiles of sesame seeds from 29 Korean provinces, 5 Chinese provinces, and 4 other countries (Nigeria, Ethiopia, India, and Pakistan). Using GC-TOF MS and LC-Orbitrap MS, 243 primary and secondary metabolites were identified. PLS-DA models discriminated Korean sesames from Chinese and others, with VIP analysis prioritizing 7 key metabolites. ROC analysis validated the discriminant power (AUC 0.916–0.996). Korean sesames had higher amino acid abundances. Hierarchical clustering and pathway overrepresentation analysis identified region-specific metabolic pathways, including aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, galactose metabolism, and alanine-aspartate-glutamate metabolism. This study provides insights for controlled cultivation and authentication of sesame origin.

**P-337: Pigmented Sorghum Polyphenols as Potential Inhibitors of Amylolytic Enzymes: An In Vitro Study Combining Starch Digestion and Untargeted Metabolomics**

**Presenting Author: Gabriele Rocchetti, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Italy**

**Co-Authors: Gianluca Giuberti, Marco Trevisan, Luigi Lucini**

**Abstract:**
Polyphenols in pigmented sorghum (PS) flours were evaluated for their potential to modulate starch digestive enzymes. Five PS varieties were compared to white sorghum (WS) flour after cooking. Untargeted metabolomics revealed high distributions of flavonoids and phenolic acids, with greater tannin and kafirin contents in PS. PS flours showed higher resistant starch (RS) and lower starch hydrolysis index (HI) compared to WS. Multivariate statistics indicated that anthocyanins and flavanol equivalents were the most discriminant compounds. Kafirin, total tannin, and RS contents negatively correlated with HI, suggesting PS flours may be useful in formulating foods with functional properties.

**P-339: Untargeted Metabolomics for the Investigation of Fish Intake Biomarkers**

**Presenting Author: Xiaofei Yin, University College Dublin, Ireland**

**Co-Authors: Helena Gibbons, Gary Frost, Lorraine Brennan**

**Abstract:**
Accurate assessment of fish intake is challenging despite its health benefits. This study aimed to identify and validate fish intake biomarkers. Ten participants consumed increasing quantities of fish (88 to 412 g/day) for three days/week over three weeks. Fasting and postprandial urine samples were analyzed using 1H NMR spectroscopy and LC-MS. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), dimethylamine, and dimethyl sulfone were identified as biomarkers, showing significant dose-response relationships. TMAO levels were higher in fish consumers in the National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS) cohort, but overall correlation was poor. LC-MS analysis revealed increases in indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate after high fish intake. TMAO alone is insufficient to determine fish intake in a free-living population.

**Presenting Author: Hisami Yamanaka-Okumura, Tokushima University, Japan**

**Co-Authors: Akiyoshi Hirayama, Aina Imai, Hiroshi Tatano, Daisuke Kajiura, Tomoyoshi Soga, Masaru Tomita**

**Abstract:**
Citrus unshiu is a popular citrus in Japan, but no biomarkers for its consumption have been established. This study aimed to identify and compare metabolites in plasma and urine following the consumption of various foods. Eight healthy men participated in a randomized crossover trial, consuming apple, Citrus unshiu, broccoli, and seaweed. Metabolomic analysis using CE-TOFMS showed that Proline betaine concentrations were significantly higher in Citrus unshiu compared to other foods in both plasma and urine. Trans-Aconitate also increased in urine. Proline betaine was identified as a candidate biomarker for Citrus unshiu consumption.

**Co-Authors: Heon-woong Kim, Hwayoung Noh, Su-yeon Cho, Hyeon-jeong Kim, Sung-Hyun Lee, Marc Gunter, Heinz Freisling, Jeong Sook Choe, Augustin Scalbert, Jung-bong Kim**

**Abstract:**
Fermentation enhances the nutritional and functional properties of food by increasing bioactivity and bioavailability. This study aimed to identify flavonoid metabolites in fermented soybean (Cheonggukjang) and non-fermented soybean using an untargeted metabolomic approach. Ten participants consumed standardized meals of fermented and non-fermented soybeans in a cross-over intervention study. UPLC-DAD-QTOF/MS analysis identified 18 isoflavones, with higher levels of simple glycoside forms in fermented soybean. Fourteen metabolites, including glucuronides, sulfates, and sulfoglucuronides, were detected in urine and plasma. Genistein 4’,7-di-O-glucuronide levels were higher in plasma after fermented soybean intake. These results contribute to understanding the health effects of fermented foods.

**Presenting Author: Hyun Young Kim, National Institute of Crop Science, South Korea**

**Co-Authors: Hyeonmi Ham, Woo Duck Seo, Mi Ja Lee, Ji-Eun Ra, Hye-Young Seo, Kwang-Sik Lee, Ki-Chang Jang, Ki Do Park**

**Abstract:**
Elicitors like organic acid salts and UV light can enhance the synthesis of secondary metabolites such as policosanol in oat sprouts. Policosanol has antioxidant, cholesterol-lowering, and liver-protective properties. This study tested the effect of 0.1% sodium chloride, 0.1% acetic acid, and UV360 treatment on policosanol content in oat sprouts. GC/MS analysis showed that sodium chloride and acetic acid treatments increased policosanol concentration to 681.84 mg/100 g and 736.4 mg/100 g, respectively, compared to 554.8 mg/100 g in the control. UV360-treated sprouts also had higher policosanol content (651.4 mg/100 g). These treatments can significantly increase policosanol levels, enhancing the market value of oat sprouts as a functional food.

**P-343: Spot and Cumulative Urine Samples as Suitable Replacements for 24-Hour Urine Samples for Objective Measures of Dietary Exposure Using Metabolite Biomarkers**

**Presenting Author: Thomas Wilson, IBERS, Aberystwyth University, United Kingdom**

**Co-Authors: Isabel Garcia-Perez, Joram M Posma, Amanda Lloyd, Edward S Chambers, Kathleen Tailliart, Hassan Zubair, Manfred Beckmann, John C Mathers, Elaine Holmes, Gary Frost, John Draper**

**Abstract:**
Self-reported dietary intake is often inaccurate. This study aimed to evaluate spot and cumulative urine samples as replacements for 24-hour urine samples in monitoring dietary intake. Participants followed four different diets over 72 hours, and urine samples were collected daily. Metabolite fingerprinting using FIE-HRMS and 1H NMR, and quantitative analysis using LC-QqQ-MS, were performed. Classification models for diet discrimination in spot, cumulative, and 24-hour urine samples predicted dietary intake accurately. Cross-validation modeling showed that spot and cumulative samples are suitable replacements for 24-hour urine samples, providing a non-invasive method for assessing dietary patterns.

**P-344: Integrated Metabolomic and Metagenomic Analysis of Korean Traditional Alcoholic Beverages Using Nuruk**

**Presenting Author: Jang Eun Lee, Korea Food Research Institute, South Korea**

**Co-Authors: Jae Ho Kim**

**Abstract:**
Nuruk, a fermentation starter made from grains, is used in brewing Korean traditional alcoholic beverages. It contains microorganisms that degrade β-starch and produce ethanol. This study used integrated metabolomic and metagenomic approaches to profile the metabolites and microbial communities in beverages produced by three types of Nuruk. GC-MS and 1H NMR, combined with multivariate analysis, were used to obtain metabolomic profiles. Results indicated that volatile metabolites are influenced by microbial diversity, while non-volatile metabolites are affected by Nuruk ingredients. These findings provide insights into how metabolites and microorganisms in Nuruk affect beverage quality and support further research on fermented foods.

**P-345: Effects of Estrogen Deficiency on Metabolic Markers and Gut Microbiota in Ovariectomized Mice Fed Normal-Fat Diet**

**Presenting Author: Youngmin Lee, Department of Food and Nutrition, Seoul Women’s University, South Korea**

**Co-Authors: Jieun Jeong, Chi Young Yun**

**Abstract:**
Estrogen deficiency is associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. This study investigated the effects of estrogen deficiency on metabolic markers and gut microbiota in ovariectomized (OVX) mice fed a normal-fat diet. C57BL/6J mice were sham-operated or ovariectomized and assigned to groups: sham-operated (S-NF) and OVX (OVX-NF). After 5 weeks, liver and serum were analyzed, and fecal DNA was extracted. OVX-NF mice had increased liver and abdominal fat weight. Actinobacteria increased, and Firmicutes decreased in OVX-NF mice. Adiponectin levels negatively correlated with Firmicutes, and abdominal fat weight positively correlated with Actinobacteria. Changes in gut microbiota may be related to estrogen deficiency-induced metabolic disorders in postmenopausal women.

**P-346: Targeted Phenolic Metabolites of Purple Potatoes in Plasma and Urine of Healthy Men**

**Presenting Author: Johanna Jokioja, University of Turku, Finland**

**Co-Authors: Kaisa M. Linderborg, Mark Philo, Jasmine Percival, Paul Kroon, Baoru Yang**

**Abstract:**
Purple potatoes contain anthocyanins, which may have health benefits. This study aimed to investigate the phenolic metabolites in plasma and urine of healthy men after consuming purple potato acylated anthocyanins. Samples were cleaned using solid-phase extraction, and targeted metabolites were detected using LC-MS in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Anthocyanins were mainly petunidin and peonidin glycosides acylated to hydroxycinnamic acids. Results suggest that purple potato anthocyanins are metabolized into phenolic metabolites, such as phloroglucinaldehyde, hydroxybenzoic acids, and hydroxycinnamic acids, and their glucuronides and sulfates.

**Co-Authors: Jose David Piñeiro-Ramos, María Gormaz, Anna Parra-Llorca, Guillermo Quintás, Izaskun Garcia-Mantrana, María Carmen Collado, Máximo Vento, Julia Kuligowski**

**Abstract:**
The interaction between the gut microbiota, host, and diet in lactating mothers and their infants is a focus in nutrition research. This study used LC-HRMS to analyze urinary metabolic biomarkers in lactating mothers and their term and preterm infants. Urine samples were collected from 27 mothers, 29 term infants (25 receiving own mother’s milk, 4 formula), and 47 preterm infants (20 receiving own mother’s milk, 20 donor human milk, 7 formula). Principal Component Analysis and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis revealed characteristic patterns and significant differences in relative urinary biomarker concentrations. These results will be used to develop a quantitative LC-MS-based method for correlating biomarkers with Food Frequency Questionnaires and gut microbiome composition.
