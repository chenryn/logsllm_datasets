### Title: Botconf 2015 - Whose Phone Is in Your Pocket?

In late April, we discovered an Android malware that installs a backdoor with root privileges on infected devices. This malware is particularly prevalent in Russia, India, Ukraine, and Algeria, but its spread is not limited to these countries. Our research has revealed infection cases worldwide.

The malware is distributed through popular third-party app stores and was available for download on Google Play from May 22, 2015, to June 9, 2015, with an estimated 100,000 to 500,000 installations. The command and control servers for the backdoor are hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) clouds.
