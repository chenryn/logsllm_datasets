### Analytic Signal
- **Amplitude and Phase**: An analytic signal is characterized by its amplitude and phase.
- **Real and Imaginary Components (Negative Frequency)**: The analytic signal consists of real and imaginary parts, which can include negative frequencies.
- **Encoding More Information**: These components allow for the encoding of more information compared to a real signal.

### Quadrature Modulation
- **Sampling with Two ADCs**: Analytic signals can be sampled using two Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs).
- **Separation into Quadrature Components**: The baseband signal must first be separated into quadrature components (real and imaginary parts).
- **Mixing with Local Oscillators**:
  - **In-Phase Local Oscillator (I Channel)**
  - **Quadrature-Phase Local Oscillator (Q Channel)**

### Sample Rate
- **Two Components per Sample Time**: The analytic signal has two components (I & Q) per sample time.
- **Double the Bandwidth**: Negative frequencies effectively double the bandwidth.
- **Shannon’s Sampling Theorem**: The sampling rate directly determines the bandwidth. This results in a stream of complex samples (I/Q pairs) at the sample rate.

### SDR (De-)modulation
- **Complex Stream Processing**: The complex stream is passed through mathematical functions and state machines for (de-)modulation.
