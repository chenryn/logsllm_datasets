**Figure 16:** Left: The average of 888 CT scans' middle slices before scaling to a 1:1:1 ratio (black areas are candidate injection locations). Right: A full slice with an injected nodule.

**Figure 17:** Examples of where the attack failed in the blind trial. Left: A removal (FB) detected as ‘ground-glass’ cancer due to too much additive noise. Right: An injection missed due to human error.

**Figure 18:** CT-GAN used to inject brain tumors into MRIs of healthy brains. Similar to Fig. 7, Top: Context, Middle: In-painted result, and Bottom: Ground-truth. Showing one slice in a 64x64x16 cuboid.

**Figure 19:** Samples of injected (top) and removed (bottom) pulmonary nodules. For each image, the left side is before tampering and the right side is after. Note, only the middle 2D slice is shown, and the images are scaled to different ratios (the source scan).

**Figure 20:** All 32 slices from a sample injection before (left) and after (right) tampering with the CT scan.
