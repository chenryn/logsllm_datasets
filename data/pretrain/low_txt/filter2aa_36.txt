## Introduction
- A vacuum cleaning robot in your home has access to your Wi-Fi and can learn many of your personal habits.
- Who among you owns a vacuum cleaning robot? (Please note that we are referring to robots you own, not those belonging to neighbors or others online.)

### Motivation
- A vacuum cleaning robot is in your house, has access to your Wi-Fi, and knows many of your personal habits.
- Neato is one of the top vacuum cleaning robot models in the US.
- In Germany, Vorwerk, founded in 1883, sells a rebranded Neato model as their top robot vacuum cleaner.
- Vorwerk's VR300/VR200 models have won test comparisons in Germany.

## Responsible Disclosure
- During our experiments, some robots were harmed (we apologize for this).
- No customer data was leaked.
- Neato was informed and all issues were fixed in a timely manner.

## Contributions
- With all these security features, what could possibly go wrong?
- We bypassed the secure boot on a vacuum cleaning robot to extract its memory.
- Our key findings include:
  - Bypassing secure boot.
  - A QNX side quest.
- We also gained unauthenticated RCE (Remote Code Execution) on robots over the cloud.

### Secure Boot Bypass
- **Custom AM335x Chip (guessed by size factor)**
- **QNX 6.5 Image from Foundry27**: Bootable but crashes.
- **Steps**:
  1. Get QNX SDP.
  2. Modify the image.
  3. Skip hardware initialization.
  4. Reboot Neato system into custom image for cold boot attack.
  5. Print all RAM to the serial port.
- **Watchdog started by Pinky, Cleaning logic binary started by Brain.**
- **CVE-2018-20785**: Fixed in Neato BotVac Connected D7 4.4.0-72 in December 2018 and for Vorwerk sometime after January 2019.

### Secret Key
- **Generated when associating a robot with a user account.**
- **Known by**: Robot, app, and cloud components.
- **Individual key for each robot/user account relation!**
- **Used for authenticating commands to the robot.**
- **Header = Authorization: NEATOAPP [signature]**
- **String to sign = serial + date + message_body**
- **Signature = HMAC_SHA256(secret_key, string_to_sign)**
- **Source**: [Neato Robotics Developers](https://developers.neatorobotics.com/)

### RSA Key
- **Robots must initially send the secret key.**
- **Secret key not that secret**:
  - Several third parties know it.
  - Cannot be used to authenticate the robot in the cloud.
- **RSA Key used to authenticate robot to cloud.**
- **Header = Authorization: NEATOBOT [serial]:[signature]**
- **String to sign = serial + http_method + URI + date + body**
- **Signature = sign_rsa_sha256(string_to_sign, rsa_private_key)**

### Secret Key Entropy Reduction
- **Fabian found and analyzed this code.**
- **CVE-2018-19441**.
- **Entropy relies on the time of robot linkage**:
  - One year = 25 bits
  - One hour = 12 bits
- **Multiple offline attack scenarios exist.**

### RSA Keys for Robot Authenticity
- **Encrypted RSA keys in /var/keys.**
- **VendorPrivateKeyProduction sounds promising!**
- **Let’s do some string de-obfuscation!**
- **RSA key is the same for all robots.**
- **Impersonate arbitrary robots**:
  - Allows for multiple other attacks.
  - Example: Leak victim’s smartphone IP.
- **Nucleo does no longer get requests.**
- **Robot location is 1.3.3.7:42.**

### Unauthenticated RCE
- **Buffer overflow in Nucleo cloud connection daemon.**
- **Triggered with requests to https://nucleo.neatocloud.com:4443/vendors/neato/robots/[robot_serial]/messages.**
- **Overflow within parsing the authentication header**:
  - Unauthenticated RCE!
  - All services run as root.
- **Fix**: Authentication headers are validated on Nucleo.
- **CVE-2018-17177 and CVE-2018-19442**.

## Security Implications
### For Customers
- **Keep IoT products offline if possible.**
- **Update your robot.**
- **Hide your robot’s serial number.**

### For Connected Ecosystem Developers
- **Using RSA, RNG, hashing, secure boot, encrypted logs, and signed firmware updates sounds good...**
- **Review cryptographic key components and root of trust assumptions.**
- **Dissecting one of your products should not compromise the security of other products, i.e., similar keys.**
- **Test your security-relevant code in practice to uncover issues like the static secret key "random" function—check entropy before hashing.**
