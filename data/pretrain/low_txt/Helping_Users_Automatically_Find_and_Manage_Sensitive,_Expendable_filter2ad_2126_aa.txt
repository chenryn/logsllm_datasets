## Abstract
With the prevalence of data breaches, forgotten files stored in the cloud pose latent privacy risks. We take a holistic approach to help users identify sensitive, unwanted files in cloud storage. First, we conducted 17 qualitative interviews to understand the factors that make humans perceive a file as sensitive, useful, and worthy of either protection or deletion. Building on these findings, we conducted a primarily quantitative online study with 108 long-term users of Google Drive or Dropbox. Participants labeled and explained the sensitivity, usefulness, and desired management (keep, delete, or protect) of selected files from their accounts. For each file, we collected metadata and content features, creating a training dataset of 3,525 labeled files. We then developed Aletheia, a system that predicts a file's perceived sensitivity and usefulness, as well as its desired management. Aletheia outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 26% to 159%, achieving 79% accuracy in predicting users' desired file-management decisions. Notably, predicting subjective perceptions of usefulness and sensitivity led to a 10% absolute accuracy improvement in predicting desired file-management decisions. Aletheia validates a human-centric approach to feature selection for subjective security-related tasks and improves upon the state of the art in minimizing the attack surface of cloud accounts.

## 1. Introduction
Since the introduction of Dropbox in 2007, cloud storage has become a convenient and affordable way to retain files over time and sync them across multiple devices with minimal user effort. However, over time, some files lose their relevance. Crucially, files that are no longer useful may still contain sensitive information, creating risks due to data breaches, lost devices, and account takeovers [5, 53, 58].

The free versions of consumer cloud services provide gigabytes of storage, which can accumulate thousands of documents and media files over the years. While this policy frees users from the risks of lost USB sticks and crashed hard drives, it also causes potentially sensitive information to accumulate in a single place. Manual management of these files is too time-consuming and tedious to be practical, making automated assistance necessary.

While researchers have recognized the need for retrospective management of consumer cloud archives [24, 49], they have not proposed concrete techniques for identifying which files users should revisit. Similarly, although Microsoft recently added a "Personal Vault" [41] to OneDrive, deciding which files to put in such a folder remains a manual process. Given the subjective and human-centered nature of file management, understanding what makes a file sensitive and expendable is essential. Information rights management (IRM) [31] and data-loss prevention (DLP) [7, 18] have similar goals of preventing the unwanted disclosure of information, but our hypothesis was that the criteria for identifying sensitive and useless files would differ between corporate and consumer domains. For example, while industry focuses on identifiers like account numbers, consumers might consider files sensitive if they cast them in a negative light or violate their self-presentation. Our results validated this hypothesis.

In this paper, we present a multi-part approach to developing an automated inference pipeline that predicts the perceived sensitivity and usefulness of files stored in the cloud. Due to the highly subjective nature of these concepts, we first explored users' mental models through 17 qualitative interviews. We found that participants considered files sensitive for both objective reasons (e.g., financial data, personally identifiable information) and subjective reasons (e.g., intimate content). They also considered files useful based on recency of access, sentimentality, and relationships.

Subsequently, we constructed and evaluated classifiers through primarily quantitative user studies. A key challenge is that sensitive files are a minority class within cloud archives. To address this, we conducted two rounds of online user studies. In Round 1, we showed 75 participants files from their own Google Drive or Dropbox accounts, asking them to rate and explain the sensitivity and usefulness of each file. We trained a preliminary classifier using this data. In Round 2, we showed 33 additional participants files selected based on the preliminary classifier to further mitigate the class imbalance. With the combined data, we trained and evaluated Aletheia, which performs three prediction tasks: (i) whether a file is perceived as sensitive, (ii) whether it is no longer useful, and (iii) the desired file-management decision (keep, delete, or protect).

Aletheia substantially improves the state of the art for identifying files in the cloud that users are likely to perceive as sensitive and no longer useful. For predicting sensitivity, Aletheia showed an AUC improvement of 68% for documents and 153% for images over a classifier using only GDLP features. For predicting files as no longer useful, Aletheia’s AUC improvement was 26% for documents and 101% for images compared to the last modified classifier. Predicting participants' desired file management, the accuracy improvement was 49% over the most sensible baseline, a majority label classifier.

### 2.1 Risks of Online Data and Cloud Storage
The risk of data breaches is significant, with governments [11, 38] and academic researchers [14, 30, 34] highlighting the potential damages caused by malicious actors stealing private data. Researchers have evaluated how individuals perceive online privacy [21, 25], identifying associated risks [35] and the magnitude of those risks in various scenarios [10, 48, 57]. Entrusting data to a third party increases the risk of data breaches, which have become common [5, 53, 58, 58]. User-centered management of data retention has become a key part of online security.

Researchers have evaluated the risks of data breaches on multiple cloud storage systems [22] and the latent danger in the cloud compared to local storage [23]. Studies have also focused on user perceptions of inadvertent storage of sensitive data [9] and strategies for minimizing risk [32]. Complementary work has evaluated file-management practices [52, 56]. Recent user research has found that most users have forgotten-about data they wish to delete stored in the cloud [24]. Researchers have also studied users' mental models of cloud storage [4] and data retention [36, 45, 55]. We build upon these insights through user studies and classifier construction to automatically identify risky files in the cloud.

### 2.2 Data Sensitivity and Data-Leak Detection
Data sensitivity is subjective, and there is no universal definition. Extensive efforts have been made to detect and quantify potentially sensitive data in various contexts. Peddinti et al. used anonymous Quora posts to understand the sensitivity of questions in a Q&A forum [42], finding that, in addition to expected topics like religion, sex, and drugs, questions about emotions, relationships, and careers were also seen as sensitive. Researchers have also developed initial methods to detect potential nudity [47] and violence [37] in image and video files, which often indicate sensitivity.

Recent industry efforts have codified IRM and DLP methods for preventing data leaks [7, 18, 31]. While these efforts aim to prevent unwanted disclosures, the characteristics associated with file sensitivity and usefulness differ between corporate and consumer domains. Industry approaches focus on identifiers (e.g., bank account numbers), while consumers might consider a file sensitive if it violates their self-presentation. For instance, Google's Cloud Data Loss Prevention API [18] aims to classify and redact sensitive information from documents, primarily marketed to organizations. The API categorizes numerous personal and financial identifiers as sensitive, partially through regex matching. Additional industry IRM solutions [5, 31] use both regex matching and access-management frameworks to tag sensitive data, but they do not incorporate subjective perceptions of file sensitivity or usefulness into the decision process.

We use Google's Cloud Data Loss Prevention API as a baseline for comparison and as one source of features for Aletheia, but our approach takes a broader view of sensitivity. We began with a qualitative study to characterize perceptions of data sensitivity, incorporating this understanding into subsequent parts of our project. Augmenting the Google Cloud Data Loss Prevention API features with others that capture subjective characteristics substantially improved classification accuracy (Section 7).

### 2.3 Automated Management of Privacy
The large quantity of forgotten-about data in the cloud requires semi-automated inference to help users revisit potentially sensitive files [24]. Researchers have proposed techniques for automated management of privacy settings. For social networks, Fang and LeFevre proposed a "privacy wizard" for automatic inference of privacy settings [12], while Ghazinour et al. used collaborative filtering to recommend privacy settings [16]. There have also been efforts to build classifiers around user-level privacy scores [29] and privacy risk [60]. Similar research focuses on inferring sensitive attributes and identity matching in online platforms [15, 17, 26, 28, 59]. Some researchers have used classifiers to predict desired permissions for image files [51] and whether content should be private or public [13, 50]. To our knowledge, we are the first to develop a classifier for automated management of files in cloud storage, especially a classifier based on sensitivity ratings of private files collected from the owners of those files in user studies, as opposed to a third party rating publicly available files.

## 3. Approach
This section summarizes our approach (Figure 2) to automatically helping users find sensitive and unwanted files in the cloud. We elaborate on our process and high-level goals and explain how we addressed the associated challenges.

### 1. Understanding Sensitivity and Usefulness
For files in the cloud, terms like sensitivity and usefulness can have subjective interpretations that vary across individuals. To enumerate these perceptions, we first conducted qualitative interviews. These interviews were open discussions to encourage participants to highlight all possible file attributes associated with sensitivity and usefulness. Subsequently, we mapped these attributes to quantitative file features that can be collected programmatically. These interviews also influenced the design of our quantitative survey. Section 4 details these interviews.

### 2. Training Data Collection and Augmentation
A prerequisite for developing an automated classifier is collecting training features and labels. To this end, we performed a quantitative study of 108 long-term users of Google Drive and Dropbox. The study combined a user survey with automated collection of various features about participants' cloud accounts and files. These features included metadata provided by the cloud services and content features extracted from the files themselves. This data was used to train and evaluate our classifiers.
