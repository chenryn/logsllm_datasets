# Information Visualization and Security

## Introduction
- **Reference**: [Wikipedia - Information Visualization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_visualization)
- **Tool Overview**: Rumint 1.15
  - **Network Monitoring Mode**: The left pane provides a network monitoring view, and clicking on a small pane brings up a detailed analysis of the visualization.

## Malicious Visualizations
- **Basic Notion**: A malicious entity can attack humans through information visualization systems by:
  - Inserting malicious data into the data stream
  - Altering the timing of data
- **Assumption**: No alteration or modification of data from legitimate sources or stored in databases is assumed.

### System Model
- **Human Consumer**
  - **Communication Channel**
  - **Consumer Node** (RAM, Hard Drive, CPU)
  - **Short-Term Memory (STM)**
  - **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**
  - **Cognition** (Vision, Hearing, Speech, Motor)
- **Human Producer**
  - **Producer Node** (RAM, Hard Drive, CPU)
  - **Short-Term Memory (STM)**
  - **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**
  - **Cognition** (Vision, Hearing, Speech, Motor)

### Attack Vectors
- **Timing Vector**: Timing Attack
- **Data Generation Vector**: Data Insertion Attack
- **Attack Manifestations**:
  - **Displacement Attack (Memory)**
  - **Attack Fading (Memory)**
  - **Color Mapping Attack (Perception)**
  - **Motion Induced Blindness (Perception)**
  - **Optical Illusions (Perception)**
  - **Spatial Orientation Attack (Descent 3)**
  - **Trust Attack (Defacement)**
  - **Visual Information Overload (Perception)**
  - **Crying Wolf (Cognitive/Motor)**
  - **Human Attention Attack**
  - **Labeling Attack (Algorithm)**
  - **GUI Widget Attack (Interface)**
  - **AutoScale Attack/Force User to Zoom (Algorithm)**
  - **Precision Attack (Algorithm)**
  - **Data Threshold Attack**
  - **Occlusion (Visualization Design)**
  - **Jitter Attack**
  - **Jamming (Visualization Design)**
  - **Trust Attack (Phishing)**
  - **Data Insertion Attack (Data Generation and Communication)**
  - **Get You Fired Attack**

### Countermeasures
- Assume an intelligent and well-informed adversary.
- Design systems with malicious data in mind.
- Train users to be alert for manipulation.
- Validate data.
- Assume your infrastructure will be attacked.
- Design visualizations and systems that are resistant to attacks.
- If you can't defeat an attack, at least facilitate detection.
- Use intelligent defaults.
- Provide adequate customization.
