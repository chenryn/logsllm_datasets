This table summarizes protected search databases that have been developed and evaluated at scale. The "Supported Operations" columns describe the queries naturally supported by each scheme. The "Properties" and "Features" columns describe the system and available functionality. Finally, "Leakage" and "Performance" describe the whole, complex system, and are therefore relative (vs. the more precisely defined values for individual operations used earlier).

## Design and Management Considerations

When using protected search databases, many design decisions such as the schema and the choice of which indices to build must be made before data is ingested and stored on the server. If an index has not been built for a particular field, it cannot be searched without returning the entire database to the querier. In general, it is not possible to dynamically permit a type of search without retrieving the entire dataset.

Additionally, if the database malfunctions, debugging efforts are complicated by the reduced visibility into server processes and logs. More generally, protected search systems are more complicated to manage and do not yet have an existing community of qualified, certified administrators.

Throughout this work, we have identified a few transient limitations that can (and should!) be mitigated with future advances. Each potential user must make their own judgment as to whether the value of improved security outweighs the performance limitations.

## Conclusion and Outlook

Several established and startup companies have commercialized protected search. Most of these products today use the Legacy technique, but we believe both Custom and Obliv approaches will find their way into products with broad user bases.

Governments and companies are finding value in lacking access to individuals' data [159]. Proactively protecting data mitigates the (ever-increasing) risk of server compromise, reduces the insider threat, can be marketed as a feature, and frees developers' time to work on other aspects of products and services. The recent HITECH US Health Care Law [160] establishes a requirement to disclose breaches involving more than 500 patients but exempts companies if the data is encrypted: “if your practice has a breach of encrypted data [...], it would not be considered a breach of unsecured data, and you would not have to report it” [161].

Protected database technology can also open up new markets, such as those cases where there is great value in recording and sharing information but the risk of data spills is too high. For example, companies recognize the value of sharing cyber threat and attack information [162], but uncontrolled sharing of this information presents a risk to reputation and intellectual property.

This paper provides a snapshot of current protected search solutions. There is currently no dominant solution for all use cases. Adopters need to understand system characteristics and trade-offs for their use case.

Protected databases will see widespread adoption. Protected search has developed rapidly since 2000, advancing from linear time equality queries on static data to complex searches on dynamic data, now within overhead between 30%-500% over standard SQL.

At the same time, the database landscape is rapidly changing, specializing, adding new functionality, and federating approaches. Integrating protected search in a unified design requires close interaction between cryptographers, protected search designers, and database experts. To spur that integration, we describe a three-pronged approach to this collaboration:
1. Developing base queries that are useful in many applications.
2. Understanding how to combine queries to support multiple applications.
3. Rapidly applying techniques to emerging database technologies.

DBMSs are more than just efficient search systems; they are highly optimized and complex systems. Protected search has shown that the database and cryptography communities can work together. The next step is to transform protected search systems into protected DBMSs.
