### Table 3: Analyzing Leak Segments by UCLA Classes Transited

Previous work has encountered some evidence of poison filtering, noting that filtering rates increase with the degree of poisoned AS. However, these studies did not aim to describe the underlying filtering mechanism or measure which ASes filter poisons. For example, Birge-Lee et al. [2] and McDaniel et al. [28] used poisons as primitives for novel BGP attacks. Both studies observed filtering when attempting to poison large transit networks but did not examine the position or prevalence of such filtering.

Hlavacek et al. [12] introduced the DISCO system for preventing BGP hijacking. Although not designed to prevent route leaks, DISCO's approach is ideologically similar to Peerlock, emphasizing deployability and usability at the expense of some security guarantees compared to RPKI/ROV filtering. This line of thinking is informed by the historically slow deployment rates of security features that harden BGP, including BGPSec [47] and the RPKI [8], [31].

### Previous Work on BGP Poisoning

Previous work that relies on BGP poisoning often assumes:
1. Unpoisoned ASes will forward poisoned updates.
2. Poisoned ASes will drop such updates (see Section II-D).

For instance, Katz-Bassett et al.’s LIFEGUARD fault detection and remediation system [19], [20] employs poisoning to steer ASes around link failures. Smith and Schuchard’s Nyx defense [42] uses rerouting with poisons for DDoS/Link Flooding Attack mitigation. Anwar et al.’s path discovery technique [1] also leverages BGP poisoning.

While we found little evidence of general poison filtering, the prevalence of Tier 1/large transit network filtering could present an obstacle to these systems. Specifically, the assumption that unpoisoned networks will propagate poisons does not hold in all cases.

### Conclusion

This work combines the deployment of Peerlock/Peerlock-lite on the control plane with active Internet measurements in Section IV. We find substantial evidence for the deployment of these leak defense systems, especially in large transit networks, and measure a rise in Peerlock deployment within the peering clique during our experiments. While the range of protected networks is still narrow within our observation window, with most filters protecting only Tier 1 ASes, many of the most disruptive recent route leaks contain these networks. Defensive systems [42], [20], measurement techniques [1], and attacks [2] that may poison Peerlock-protected networks could inadvertently trigger these filters. Therefore, BGP simulators should account for the presence of Peerlock to faithfully reproduce control plane behavior.

We also examine how the position and prevalence of filtering impact leak propagation in the AS-level topology in Section V. Notably, we find that large ISPs play a major role in global leak dissemination, signaling that Tier 1 clique deployment of Peerlock alone is not sufficient to isolate leaks. Strategic placement of filters at these large transit providers, which account for fewer than 1% of all ASes, completely mitigates 80% of simulated Tier 1 route leaks.

The MANRS filtering guide encourages AS PATH filtering by member ISPs, particularly for screening customer advertisements, and gives Peerlock/Peerlock-lite as examples. However, these systems are not explicitly required, unlike IRR filtering (see [5] Section 4.1.1.1). Given the many indirect/direct customers these networks serve, ISPs are best equipped and incentivized to deploy effective filters. Moreover, neither Peerlock nor Peerlock-lite is technically complex or burdensome to configure. Therefore, we argue for broad application of these common-sense leak prevention techniques by ISPs as a meaningful step in securing inter-domain routing.

### Operator Engagement

This study’s preprint was posted to the NANOG and RIPE operator mailing lists in June and August 2020. While operator response was limited, email correspondence around the study yielded some helpful insights. One European AS operator claimed that at least one (and possibly additional) transit networks deployed techniques similar to Peerlock around 2007, roughly ten years before NTT’s codification of the method [18]. Separately, a Tier 1 network operator suggested that 1) differences in network automation sophistication could account for observed uneven filtering within the peering clique and 2) defensive filtering may have partially mitigated the Verizon/Cloudflare leaks detailed in Section II-B. This idea is supported by Cloudflare’s discussion on the incident [23]. Cloudflare identifies some networks that filtered the leaks (including ASes 1299 Telia, 2914 NTT, and 7018 AT&T). Bandwidth graphs presented in that post indicate little or no impact on Cloudflare-to-AT&T data plane operation, while Cloudflare traffic to leak propagator Verizon was drastically reduced for hours after the incident.

### Future Directions

Widespread adoption of Peerlock will likely depend on addressing scalability issues. Rule configuration currently requires non-standard, manual out-of-band communication between protector/protected ASes. Automating this process is a crucial step in extending Peerlock beyond core networks. Communities designating authorized upstreams for routes, as proposed in [16], could take the place of out-of-band communication. Alternatively, RPKI registration of direct/indirect customers [17] could distribute trusted topological information relevant to filtering.

### Appendix

**Update Propagation: Before (August 2019) and After (May 2020)**

Before and after conducting our control-plane experiments in Section IV, we performed simple tests to measure:
1. The time distribution for BGP update arrivals at RIPE/RouteViews collectors for normal and poisoned advertisements issued from PEERING.
2. The time distribution for unique ASes seen on AS PATHs in those updates. The latter is most critical for our experiments, as we build our filtering inferences from the presence/absence of ASes on update AS PATHs.

These tests consisted of an explicit /24 withdrawal followed by a one-hour waiting period, then a normal /24 advertisement. We listened for updates for the /24 at all BGPStream collectors, and recorded the arrival times of updates for the advertised prefix for one hour. We also noted when unique ASes were first seen on the updates’ AS PATHs. This process (withdraw, update, listen) was repeated five times. We conducted the same process with a poisoned /24 advertisement, for a total of 10 advertisements per experiment.

The results are shown below in Figures 12 and 13. About 80% of updates triggered by a normal or poisoned /24 advertisement that arrived within an hour were received within 30 minutes post-origination in the August experiment. In May, more than 95% of updates fell within this period. More importantly, for every experiment, all unique ASes seen on update paths over the hour listening window arrived within the first 25 minutes post-origination. Over 95% of unique ASes were seen within 7 minutes post-origination.
