I have reviewed the guide available at [this link](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Add-Flutter-to-existing-apps) and found it to be effective. Now, I intend to integrate the output files (framework and assets) into an existing iOS application. However, it appears that the simulator does not support Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation and instead runs in debug mode using a virtual machine (VM).
