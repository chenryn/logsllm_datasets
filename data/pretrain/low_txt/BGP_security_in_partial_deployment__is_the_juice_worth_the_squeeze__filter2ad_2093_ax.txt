### Rvi

**Proof.** The proof of this lemma follows a similar structure to the proof of Lemma B.2, using induction on the FCR (Forwarding Control Route) iteration.

#### Base Case: First Iteration
Consider the first iteration. Let \( v_i \) be the AS (Autonomous System) chosen at this iteration, and let \( v_j \) be a next-hop on a route in \( v_i \)'s BPR (Best Path Route) set. Observe that either \( v_j = d \) (the destination) or \( v_j \)'s route was fixed in FSCR (Forwarding Secure Control Route). If \( v_j \) were not fixed, it would have been selected in FCR before \( v_i \). By Lemma B.5 (and the fact that \( d \)'s route is trivially fixed), under S*BGP convergence, each such \( v_j \)'s route will stabilize at some point. From that point onwards, \( v_i \) will repeatedly select \( R_{v_i} \) (as argued similarly in Lemma B.2).

#### Inductive Step
Assume that for every AS chosen in iterations 1 through \( r \), the statement of the lemma holds. Let \( v_i \) be the AS chosen at iteration \( r + 1 \) of FCR. Consider \( v_i \)'s BPR set at this time and an AS \( v_j \) that is \( v_i \)'s next-hop on some route in \( v_i \)'s BPR set. Notice that \( v_j \)'s route must either have been fixed in FCR at some iteration in \{1, ..., r\} (if \( v_j \) has a shorter perceivable customer route than \( v_i \)) or in FSCR (if \( v_j \) has a secure customer route to \( d \)). By the induction hypothesis, at some point in the S*BGP convergence process, \( v_j \)'s route converges to \( R_{v_j} \) for every such AS \( v_j \). As before, from that point in time onwards, \( v_i \) will repeatedly select \( R_{v_i} \).

### Lemma B.7

**Under S*BGP routing, the route of every AS added to I in FPeeR (Forwarding Peer-to-Peer Route) is guaranteed to stabilize to the route \( R_{v_i} \).**

**Proof.** The proof is identical to that of Lemma B.3.

### Lemma B.9

**Under S*BGP routing, the route of every AS added to I in FPrvR (Forwarding Provider-to-Provider Route) is guaranteed to stabilize to the route \( R_{v_i} \).**

**Proof.** We prove this lemma by induction on the number of FPrvR iterations, following a similar structure to the proof of Lemma B.2.

#### Base Case: First Iteration
Consider the first iteration. Let \( v_i \) be the AS chosen at this iteration, let \( v_j \) be a next-hop of \( v_i \) on some route \( R \) in \( v_i \)'s BPR set, and let \( Q \) be the suffix of \( R \) at \( v_j \). Observe that either \( Q \) is a customer/peer route, in which case \( v_j \)'s route was fixed before FSPrvR, or \( Q \) is a secure provider route, in which case \( v_j \)'s route was fixed in FSPrvR. Using Lemma B.8 and an argument similar to that in the proof of Lemma B.2, we can conclude that \( v_i \)'s route will indeed converge to \( R_{v_i} \) at some point in the S*BGP routing process.

#### Inductive Step
Assume that for every AS chosen in iterations 1 through \( r \), the statement of the lemma holds. Let \( v_i \) be the AS chosen at iteration \( r + 1 \) of FPrvR and consider \( v_i \)'s BPR set at this time. Let \( v_j \) again be a next-hop of \( v_i \) on some route \( R \) in \( v_i \)'s BPR set, and let \( Q \) be the suffix of \( R \) at \( v_j \). Observe that if \( Q \) is a provider route, then \( v_j \)'s route must have been fixed in either FSPrvR or in FPrvR at some point in iterations \{1, ..., r\}. If \( Q \) is either a customer route or a peer route, \( v_j \)'s route must have been fixed in either FCR or FPeeR. By the previous lemmas and the induction hypothesis, under S*BGP convergence, every such \( v_j \)'s route will eventually converge to \( R_{v_j} \). Therefore, \( v_i \)'s route too will converge to \( R_{v_i} \).

### B.5.3 Correctness of Algorithm for Security 1st Model

The proof that our algorithm for the security 1st model outputs the S*BGP routing outcome in this model follows from the combination of the lemmas below. The proofs are almost identical to those for the other two models and are therefore omitted. Let \( R_{v_i} \) be the route from \( v_i \) induced by the algorithm's computed next-hops.

**Lemma B.10.** Under S*BGP routing, the route of every AS added to I in FSCR is guaranteed to stabilize to the route \( R_{v_i} \).

**Lemma B.11.** Under S*BGP routing, the route of every AS added to I in FSPeeR is guaranteed to stabilize to the route \( R_{v_i} \).

**Lemma B.12.** Under S*BGP routing, the route of every AS added to I in FSPrvR is guaranteed to stabilize to the route \( R_{v_i} \).

**Lemma B.13.** Under S*BGP routing, the route of every AS added to I in FCR is guaranteed to stabilize to the route \( R_{v_i} \).

**Lemma B.14.** Under S*BGP routing, the route of every AS added to I in FPeeR is guaranteed to stabilize to the route \( R_{v_i} \).

**Lemma B.15.** Under S*BGP routing, the route of every AS added to I in FPrvR is guaranteed to stabilize to the route \( R_{v_i} \).
