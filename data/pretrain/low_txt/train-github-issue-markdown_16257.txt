### Issue Description

When searching for "AUTO_STYLE," the search results return two API entries, both of which link to the same API page. Further investigation using the API search also reveals two entries: one in the core module (which is deprecated) and another in the animations module.

Interestingly, both pages display the same contentâ€”the content for the `AUTO_STYLE` in the animations module. The information about the deprecated `AUTO_STYLE` in the core module is missing. However, the browser address bar shows different paths for each entry.

There is an API filter for deprecated items, indicating that we intend to show deprecated objects in the API search. The issue here is that the non-deprecated content from the animations module is being displayed on the deprecated core module link.

This may be a symptom of a deeper problem with API pages that have the same title. While it is unusual, but not impossible, for two different modules to have an object with the same name (as is the case with `AUTO_STYLE`), the content should be distinct. I suspect that a bug is causing the last-generated content to be assigned to all links with the same title.
