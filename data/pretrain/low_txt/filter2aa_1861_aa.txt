### Slide 3
**Content Overview**
- This presentation contains some mathematical and statistical concepts.
- We will discuss Statistics and Machine Learning (also known as Predictive Analytics).
- We will keep technical details to a minimum, but additional information will be provided in the slide notes and handouts.
- Let's proceed with the presentation.

---

### Slide 4
**Odds and Las Vegas**
- It's fitting to discuss odds, given that we are in Las Vegas.

---

### Slide 5
**Goal: Improve the Odds**
- Our goal was to improve the likelihood of finding users who are more likely to respond to a relatively simple Twitter bot.
- While it would be interesting to predict susceptibility with high accuracy, our aim was more modest.
- As Eric Siegel states in his book, "Predictions need not be accurate to score big value."
- Reference:
  - Siegel, E. (2013). *Predictive analytics*. Hoboken, N.J.: Wiley.

---

### Slide 6
**Realistic Expectations**
- I want to be upfront: the improvements we achieved may not seem very exciting.
- However, for those interested in machine learning and prediction, the results should still be of interest.

---

### Slide 7
**Tim Hwang**
- Does anyone know who this person is? This is Tim Hwang.

### Slide 8
**Social Bots Competition (2011)**
- In early 2011, I discovered a fascinating competition hosted by Tim Hwang and the Web Ecology Project.
- The competition involved creating social bots to interact with a set of 500 unsuspecting users.
- References:
  - 5-minute video overview: [http://ignitesanfrancisco.com/83e/tim-hwang/](http://ignitesanfrancisco.com/83e/tim-hwang/)
  - Winner's blog post: [http://aerofade.rk.net.nz/?p=152](http://aerofade.rk.net.nz/?p=152) (@AeroFade on Twitter)

**Winning Bot Strategy:**
- Created a lead bot called @JamesMTitus
- Followed all 500 target users immediately
- Tweeted random messages every 2-3 hours
- Posted pictures of "cute cats" from Flickr to a blog, which auto-tweeted to James' timeline
- Used secondary bots to follow the network of the 500 users and their followers to test for follow-backs
- Expanded the network across mutual followers to increase visibility

---

### Slide 9
**Competition Participants**
- Three teams participated and were given the same 500 users to target.

---

### Slide 10
**Target Users**
- The 500 targets shared a common interest in cats (the animals, not the musical).

---

### Slide 11
**Scoring System**
- Teams gained points for:
  - +1 point for a follow back
  - +3 points for a social response
- Teams lost points for:
  - -15 points if the bot was suspended by Twitter

---

### Slide 12
**Blood Sport for Internet Nerds**
- The competition was described as "blood sport for internet social science/network analysis nerds."

---

### Slide 13
**Results**
- Two weeks later, the winning team achieved 701 points, 107 mutual follow-backs, and 198 social responses.

---

### Slide 14
**Research Focus**
- Most research has focused on identifying bots, but less attention has been given to detecting users likely to be fooled by bots.

---

### Slide 15
**Importance of User Detection**
- Detecting users likely to be fooled by bots is important for raising awareness and seeking solutions.
- This point was raised by Yazan Boshmaf in the paper "Design and Analysis of a Social Botnet."
- Reference:
  - Boshmaf, Y. (2012). *Design and Analysis of a Social Botnet*. [http://lersse-dl.ece.ubc.ca/record/277/files/COMNET_Socialbots_2012.pdf](http://lersse-dl.ece.ubc.ca/record/277/files/COMNET_Socialbots_2012.pdf)

---

### Slide 16
**Our Study (2012)**
- During our 2012 study on Twitter usage and the Dark Triad of personality, we incorporated a side project to look at social bots.
- Reference:
  - Sumner, C., Byers, A., Boochever, R., & Park, G. J. (2012). *Predicting Dark Triad Personality Traits from Twitter usage and a linguistic analysis of Tweets*. 11th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, 2012, pp. 386-393. [https://www.onlineprivacyfoundation.org/research_/PredictingdarkTriadPersonalityTraitsfromTwitter.pdf](https://www.onlineprivacyfoundation.org/research_/PredictingdarkTriadPersonalityTraitsfromTwitter.pdf)

---

### Slide 17
**Research Questions**
- Are some users more naturally predisposed to interacting with social bots?
- Does personality play a role in this predisposition?

---

### Slide 18
**Increasing Response Odds**
- Is it possible to use machine learning to increase the odds of getting a response from a Twitter user?

---

### Slide 19
**Reducing Suspensions**
- By targeting users more likely to respond, social bot creators can reduce the chances of account suspension (Twitter Jail).

---

### Slide 20
**Who Cares?**
- The obvious question is, "Who cares?" We will explore this in depth, but here is a high-level summary.

---

### Slide 21
**Stakeholders: Marketeers**
- Marketeers looking to increase their Klout (or Kred) score for a brand might focus on users more likely to interact with them.
- This strategy can be useful for building a brand (real or fake), but it can also lead to some users receiving more spam than others.

---

### Slide 22
**Stakeholders: Propagandists**
- Propagandists and AstroTurfers can find users most likely to help propagate their message or give credence to the bot account.

---

### Slide 23
**Stakeholders: Social Engineers**
- Social engineers can use easily obtainable features (Klout score, number of friends/follows) to build models in tools like Maltego.
- Example: Highlighting users in a social graph who are more likely to engage in conversation.

  - Huber, M., Kowalski, S., Nohlberg, M., & Tjoa, S. (2009). *Towards automating social engineering using social networking sites*. Computational Science and Engineering, IEEE International Conference on, 3:117–124.

---

### Slide 24
**Privacy Implications**
- The privacy implications of social bots are well described in Erhardt Graeff's 2013 paper.
- Reference:
  - Graeff, E. (2013). *What We Should Do Before the Social Bots Take Over: Online Privacy Protection and the Political Economy of Our Near Future*. Media in Transition 8, Cambridge, MA, May 3-5.

---

### Slide 25
**Social Network Providers**
- Social media sites are getting better at detecting bots, so an effective bot strategy involves reducing the chances of suspension.

### Slide 29
**Definition of Social Bots**
- "A social bot is a piece of software that controls a user account in an online social network and passes itself off as a human." (Wagner et al., 2012)
- Reference:
  - Wagner, C., Mitter, S., & Strohmaier, M. (2012). *When social bots attack: Modeling susceptibility of users in online social networks*. [http://www.markusstrohmaier.info/documents/2012_MSM12_socialbots.pdf](http://www.markusstrohmaier.info/documents/2012_MSM12_socialbots.pdf)

**Social Bot Objectives:**
- Make friends
- Gain trust
- Influence

### Slide 30
**The Sybil Attack (2002)**
- John R. Douceur, Microsoft Research
- Social bots are sometimes referred to as "Sybils," a term used in the 2002 paper "The Sybil Attack."
- Reference:
  - Douceur, J. R. (2002). *The Sybil Attack*. [http://www.few.vu.nl/~mconti/teaching/ATCNS2010/ATCS/Sybil/Sybil.pdf](http://www.few.vu.nl/~mconti/teaching/ATCNS2010/ATCS/Sybil/Sybil.pdf)

---

### Slide 31
**Evolution of Bots**
- Chatterbots have been around since the 1990s, but we focus on social media bots.
- First Generation: Basic bots (e.g., fake followers)
- Second Generation: Smarter, more sophisticated bots
- Reference:

---

### Slide 32
**Fake Followers**
- Early bots were primarily used to make accounts appear popular with fake followers.
- These bots remain popular and lucrative, but they are relatively simple.
- Reference:
  - [http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/fake-twitter-followers-becomes-multimillion-dollar-business/](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/fake-twitter-followers-becomes-multimillion-dollar-business/)

---

### Slide 33
**Spam Bots**
- Traditional spam bots are still prevalent.
- Reference:
  - Grier, C. (2010). *@spam: The Underground on 140 Characters or Less*. [http://imchris.org/research/grier_ccs2010.pdf](http://imchris.org/research/grier_ccs2010.pdf)

---

### Slide 34
**Amusing Bots**
- Some bots are designed for humor.
- Example: Kevin thanks the Universe.

---

### Slide 35
**Humorous Interactions**
- The Universe responds to Kevin.

---

### Slide 36
**Climate Change Bots**
- Bots like @AI_AGW respond to climate change deniers.
