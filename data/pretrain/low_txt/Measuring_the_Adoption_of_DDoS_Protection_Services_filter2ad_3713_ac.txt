### Data Smoothing and Anomaly Handling

To smooth out shorter and smaller anomalies, we calculate the median reference count over a time window of several weeks. Larger anomalies are manually cleaned. This process helps in distinguishing between always-on and on-demand usage. Figure 5 illustrates the combined growth of the nine providers relative to the start of our dataset, covering approximately 50% of the global domain namespace. The overall expansion of the involved zones is also depicted. A clear trend in the adoption of DDoS Protection Services (DPSs) is evident, primarily driven by Cloudflare, DOSarrest, Incapsula, and Verisign (refer to Figure 3). Other providers, such as F5 Networks and CenturyLink, contribute to occasional decreases (e.g., the dip in March 2016). As shown, DPS use has grown by 1.24× over 1.5 years, exceeding the overall expansion of 1.09×, from about 140 million to 152 million domains.

### Application to .nl and Alexa Top 1M

We applied the same procedure to our six-month dataset for .nl and the Alexa Top 1M. Figure 6 displays the results. For .nl, a growth trend of 10.5% against 1.8% is observed, and for Alexa, the growth is 11.8%.

### Third-Party Anomalies

We traced many of the larger anomalies to on-demand or always-on use by third parties, and in one case, to a DNS issue at a third party. Here are a few examples:
- **Incapsula:**
  - **Wix:** Repeated swings of millions of domain names, such as the peak in April 2016 involving 1.76 million names.
  - **SiteMatrix:** Increase in June 2016, involving about 170,000 domain names.
- **Verisign:**
  - **ENOM and ZOHO:** Changes of up to 700,000 domains.
- **Cloudflare:**
  - **Namecheap:** Anomaly in February 2016 involving ~247,000 domains.
- **Akamai:**
  - **Sedo Domain Parking:** Trough on November 22nd, 2015, involving ~716,000 domains.
- **CenturyLink:**
  - **Domain Management Platform:** Significant drop in February 2016, involving ~355,000 domains.

### Daily Fluctuations and Repeated Anomalies

To study if repeated anomalies involve the same set of domain names, we analyzed the daily flux per provider in terms of first seen and last seen domain names. This method ensures that if protection is turned on and off several times for a set of names, the names involved will contribute to influx at most once and to outflux at most once. Figure 7 shows the delta of first seen and last seen counts in two-week time windows. Repeated anomalies can be traced to the same sets of domain names. For example, the large influx for Incapsula in March 2015 indicates that many of the same domains were involved in the anomalous plateau starting in May 2015. Over time, some providers, like Cloudflare, contribute more gradually to DPS adoption, as their influx is spread out.

### On-Demand Use

Our analysis of larger anomalies shows that many can be traced to on-demand use, while some are suspected to be always-on domains due to only an upward or downward edge. Since our measurement period is finite, it is challenging to determine if an opposing edge can be found outside this period. To gain more insight into dynamic behavior among the various providers, we estimate sets of on-demand domains based on showing at least three peaks over 1.5 years. Figure 8 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of peak occurrences. For providers with highly anomalous day-to-day behavior, the majority of peak occurrences are short-lived (i.e., P(duration <= days) = 0.8). Neustar, for example, has 80% of all peaks lasting four days or fewer, likely due to their hybrid always-on solution where traffic is not continuously diverted to the cloud.

### Conclusions

This work demonstrates significant growth in the adoption of DDoS Protection Services in over 50% of the global domain namespace we studied. The relative growth of 1.24× over 1.5 years surpasses the overall expansion of 1.09× of the considered namespace (.com, .net, and .org). Our methodology can be used to analyze how domains divert traffic to a DPS and whether optional services (e.g., name server protection) are used. We reveal differences in the use of protection methods among providers, even when they support similar services. Some providers have a small percentage of domains using delegation, potentially leaving parts of a domain’s DNS infrastructure susceptible to DDoS attacks. Finally, our results show that a large contribution to the user base and adoption of DPS providers is made by third parties, such as web hosters and domainers. These players can activate or deactivate DDoS protection for millions of domains from one day to the next, either by leveraging the DNS to divert traffic or by having the DPS announce one or multiple IP prefixes.
