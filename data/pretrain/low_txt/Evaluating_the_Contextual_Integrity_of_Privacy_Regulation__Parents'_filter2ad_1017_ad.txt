### Individual Privacy Concerns and Income

Research on privacy concerns has yielded mixed results. Some studies suggest that individuals are less concerned about privacy [24, 33], while others report that high-income individuals are more likely to engage in privacy-preserving behaviors [41]. Still, other studies find no significant income effect on privacy concerns [57].

### Limitations of the Survey

Our survey, limited to parents, does not capture the perspectives of other stakeholders, such as school and daycare teachers or extended family members, who also purchase internet-connected toys for children. These groups may have different privacy norms and are also subject to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Their opinions and interests should be reflected in children’s privacy regulations. Additionally, we did not inquire whether our respondents belonged to communities with less common privacy norms. Our respondent panel, drawn from across the United States, likely underrepresented smaller demographic groups.

Furthermore, all respondents were parents living in the United States, as COPPA applies only to products sold in the U.S. This means their views are influenced by American attitudes toward privacy, which may differ from those of parents in other countries. Future research should apply the CI survey method used in this paper to evaluate the alignment between privacy norms and regulations in non-U.S. contexts.

### Goals of Privacy Regulation

Using CI surveys to evaluate privacy regulation assumes that the primary value of such regulation is to align data collection practices with privacy norms. This approach implicitly argues that the purpose of privacy regulation is to reflect these norms, which may not always be the case, especially for majority populations. For instance, privacy regulation might aim to protect minority or vulnerable populations. In such cases, surveys of all affected individuals might reflect a majority view that does not value the norms or understand the situation of the target population. CI surveys can still be useful, but care must be taken to identify and recruit respondents from differentially affected populations to uncover discrepancies between the regulation and the norms of these groups.

Additionally, some regulations may be designed to change existing norms. In these instances, CI surveys will initially show that the regulation does not match current privacy expectations. However, CI surveys can be valuable for longitudinal measurements to track whether the regulation has the desired effect on privacy norms over time.

### Discussion and Future Work

We hope this study serves as a template for future work using contextual integrity to analyze current or pending privacy regulations for policy or systems design insights. This section discusses our COPPA findings and presents suggestions for future applications of our method by policymakers, device manufacturers, and researchers.

#### COPPA Insights and Concerns

Previous research indicates that parents actively manage information about their children on social media platforms to avoid oversharing [2] and that owners of IoT home appliances view most data collection by these devices as inherently unacceptable [3]. We expected these domains to overlap, leading to skepticism about smart toy data collection, even with COPPA restrictions. Surprisingly, it seems that the COPPA criteria generally assuaged parents’ privacy concerns.

While we are encouraged that COPPA generally aligns with parents’ privacy expectations, we are concerned that the existence of COPPA may give parents an unreasonable expectation that their children’s data is protected. Parents familiar with COPPA were less critical of smart toy information flows. Several online services and internet-connected toys have been found to violate COPPA [6, 43], and many more non-compliant toys are likely available for purchase. The broad information collection guidelines in COPPA leave room for technical implementations that adhere to the letter of the law but still compromise children’s privacy. This underscores the need for continued work by regulators and researchers to identify toys that place children’s privacy at risk and for parents to maintain a healthy skepticism before purchasing any particular toy.

Variations in information flow acceptability across recipients corroborate previous work [58] indicating that privacy norms are deeply contingent on the perception of entities that collect online data. COPPA distinguishes between first- and third-parties but does not further categorize data recipients. This increases the flexibility of the law but raises the potential that some recipients, viewed as completely unacceptable by privacy norms, could still legally access children’s data. Incorporating a more contextual framing of entities could improve the ability of future regulations to prevent unwanted data collection practices.

#### Further Policy Analysis Applications

The CI survey method is not limited to COPPA. Follow-up studies focusing on different regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act, and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), could provide similar insights into the acceptability of information flows for their target populations. As most privacy regulations encompass information transfer or exchange, the theory of contextual integrity is an appropriate framework for this research. Such studies would also allow for cross-regulatory analysis to find common factors affecting the alignment with privacy norms.

The CI survey method could be incorporated into the policymaking process. Policy formulation and resource allocation could be guided by surveying a wide variety of information flows allowed under current regulation and identifying egregious or unexpected norm violations that require attention. Policymakers could test whether previous regulatory approaches will be applicable to new innovations by conducting surveys with CI parameters describing new technologies and existing regulations. Policymakers could also perform A/B tests of policy drafts with different stipulations and/or language by conducting multiple parallel surveys with varying CI parameters. These and other use cases would improve quantitative rigor in data-driven policy development and facilitate the design of regulations responsive to the privacy norms of affected populations.

#### Systems Design Applications

The application of CI surveys to guide systems and product design is covered in detail in our previous work [3]. To summarize, device manufacturers can conduct CI surveys to determine whether information collection practices of devices or new features under development will violate consumer privacy norms. This allows modifications during the design process to prevent consumer backlash and public relations debacles.

Applying CI surveys to evaluate privacy regulation can also yield valuable insights for systems research and development. For example, learning that parents value the ability to revoke consent or delete information motivates research into verifiable deletion of cloud data from IoT platforms. Such insights are especially relevant as neither privacy norms nor regulations are necessarily tied to technical systems feasibility. Discovering that a particular CI parameter value is crucial to privacy norm adherence could launch several research projects developing efficient implementations or correctness proofs. We expect future applications of the CI survey method will generate many such results.

### Conclusion

Increased interest in data privacy has spurred new and updated regulations around the world. However, there are no widely accepted methods to determine whether these regulations actually align with the privacy preferences of those they seek to protect. Here, we demonstrate that a previously developed survey technique [3] based on the formal theory of contextual integrity (CI) can be adapted to effectively measure whether data privacy regulations match the norms of affected populations. We applied this methodology to test whether the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act’s (COPPA) restrictions on data collection by internet-connected “smart” toys align with parents’ norms. We surveyed 195 parents of children younger than 13 about the acceptability of 1,056 smart toy information flows that describe concrete data collection scenarios with and without COPPA restrictions.

We found that information flows conditionally allowed by COPPA are generally viewed as acceptable by the surveyed parents, in contrast to identical flows without COPPA-mandated restrictions. These are the first data indicating the general alignment of COPPA to parents’ privacy norms for smart toys. However, variations in information flow acceptability across smart toys, information types, and respondent demographics emphasize the importance of detailed contextual factors to privacy norms and motivate further study.

COPPA is just one of many U.S. and international data privacy regulations. We hope that this work will serve as a template for others to adopt and repeat the CI survey method to study other legislation, allowing for a cross-sectional and longitudinal picture of the ongoing relationship between regulation and social privacy norms.
