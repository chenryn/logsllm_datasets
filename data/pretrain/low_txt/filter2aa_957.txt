## What We’re Covering Today
- Why Care?
- Current Threat and Detection Landscape
- Project Goals
- SITCH: MkI
- SITCH: MkII
- Service Architecture
- Future Plans
- Prior Art
- Q&A

## Why Care?
- Invasions of privacy, even if unnoticed, are harmful.
- Industrial espionage can lead to significant financial and job losses.

## Terminology
- **Software-Defined Radio (SDR)**: Uses software to process signals in conjunction with an adjustable-frequency RF receiver.
- **FCCH (Frequency Correction Channel)**
- **ARFCN (Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number)**
- **CGI (Cell Global ID)**: Composed of MCC (Mobile Country Code), MNC (Mobile Network Code), LAC (Location Area Code), and CI (Cell Identity)
- **IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)**

## GSM Addressing
- Explains how devices are addressed in the GSM network.

## Threat and Detection Landscape
- **Malicious Devices**
- **Indicators of Attack**
- **Existing Detection Methods**

### Malicious Devices
- **Hacked Femtocell**: A trusted part of the provider’s network, but your phone cannot detect its malicious intent.
- **Evil BTS (Base Transceiver Station)**: Your handset will automatically connect, unable to verify the BTS's trustworthiness.

### Indicators of Attack
- ARFCN over threshold
- ARFCN outside forecast
- Unrecognized CGI
- Gratuitous BTS re-association
- BTS detected outside of range

### Existing Detection Methods
- **Commercial Options**:
  - Pwnie Express
  - Bastille Networks
- **Open Source**:
  - Fake BTS
  - AIMSICD
  - Femto Catcher

## Project Goals
- **Cost-Effective**: Aim for a solution under $100.
- **Compact and Low-Power**: Small footprint and low power consumption.
- **Functional Targets**: Comprehensive coverage of Indicators of Attack (IOA).

## Tested Hardware
- Some of the hardware tested for the project.

## Functional Targets
- ARFCN over threshold
- ARFCN outside of forecast
- Unrecognized CGI
- Gratuitous BTS re-association
- BTS detected out of range

## SITCH Sensor MkI
- **Results**:
  - ARFCN over threshold: YES
  - ARFCN outside of forecast: YES
  - Unrecognized CGI: NO
  - Gratuitous BTS re-association: NO
  - BTS detected outside of range: NO
- **Price**: ~$100
