**Title: Black Hat Asia 2020: Engineering Cybersecurity for a Nationâ€”Lessons from Cars and Sanitation in Singapore**

Defending a nation is fundamentally different from protecting a corporate network. As Singapore aspires to become a Smart Nation, it must shift the paradigm of cybersecurity to achieve this goal. This transformation will require challenging some deeply held mental models:

- Should cybersecurity be considered a public good?
- Is cybersecurity primarily an engineering problem or a policy issue?
- Should users bear sole responsibility for cybersecurity?
- Should cybersecurity be viewed as a cost or a benefit to companies?

Addressing these dilemmas and examining how other sectors, such as automotive and sanitation, have tackled similar challenges, can help us define a new, more effective approach to cybersecurity in Singapore.
