### Future Work and Open Questions

1. **Further Justification of Generalizability**:
   - To further justify the generalizability of our recovery method, we will expand the scope of sporadic operations tested. In addition to the five operations used in the current evaluation, other sporadic operations such as uninstallation can be utilized to test POD-Recovery's generalizability and its ability to meet various recovery requirements.

2. **Testing on Other Cloud Platforms**:
   - We will conduct additional testing of POD-Recovery on other public cloud platforms, such as Windows Azure and Google App Engine. These platforms are similar to AWS in terms of cloud resource provisioning and log information generation, which will help confirm the applicability of POD-Recovery to a broader range of public clouds.
   - Additionally, we will explore ways to tailor POD-Recovery for private cloud platforms. Given that some companies use their own private clouds, which may not fully satisfy the required assumptions of POD-Recovery, we aim to develop a tailored version to cater to these environments.

3. **Exploration of More Cloud Benchmarking Tools**:
   - The evaluation of recovery actions should not be limited to the TPC-W benchmark, which is representative of typical three-tier web applications. As cloud applications within industries have evolved beyond this model, we will introduce a variety of cloud benchmarking tools to more comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of our recovery methods.

4. **Open Questions for Future Work**:
   - **Assumption Validity**: To what extent do our assumptions and conditions hold for non-cloud distributed systems?
   - **Relaxing Assumptions**: How can the assumptions be relaxed to make non-intrusive recovery systems more broadly applicable?
   - **Methodology Adaptation**: How can our recovery methodology be readjusted and extended to cater to various and complex real-world business needs?
   - **Emerging Research Topics**: What potential research topics arise from the findings of our current research?
