The system also measures signal strength, but it does so by exploiting the physical movement of on-body sensors rather than capturing the signal over a range of frequencies. 

The study in [6] is related to our work as it proposes a method for robust key establishment among on-body sensors within a body area network using the human body channel. Key establishment is directly related to our problem statement, which is secure device pairing. However, their approach differs from ours, as the authors suggest injecting an artificial voltage signal below the action potential level of the human body to construct a covert communication channel. Their scheme uses electrical field propagation within the human body for communication that is secure against an outside eavesdropper.

Similar to the aforementioned paper, most research on the security of body channel communication and body area networks focuses on implantable and body-worn medical sensors. While our problem statement is substantially different from medical sensors and on-body devices, there are some similarities, particularly the fact that the human body can serve as a transmission medium. Some on-body or implantable medical devices use body channel communication to transmit and receive sensor readings, either to and from each other or to establish communication with an external device used for monitoring and programming the implantable devices. An extensive survey and overview of the literature on the security and privacy of body area networks and implantable medical devices can be found in [25].

We divide the remainder of the related work into two categories: (a) alternatives for secure device pairing and (b) applications of body communication published in literature outside of system security.

**a) Secure Device Pairing:**
Prior research has yielded numerous methods for implementing secure device pairing. Most of these methods involve the user authenticating information interactively and augmenting the device pairing process with an out-of-band channel to mitigate man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Various types of auxiliary channels have been proposed, such as the visual channel [22], the audio channel [31], or gesture-based channels [5], [21], [24]. Some approaches combine different out-of-band channels; for example, the proposal in [2] uses both the acoustic and vibration channels to reduce the risk of side-channel attacks. The authors mask the keying material transmitted via vibrations by actively injecting noise on the audio channel. Depending on the platform and available sensors, many combinations of auxiliary channels are possible. For instance, in Augmented Reality headsets, it is feasible to combine the visual channel with a gesture-based channel, as suggested in [29].

In terms of usability, we believe that gesture-based approaches, such as the one presented in [24], are most similar to the idea presented in this paper. The authors of [24] present a device pairing solution for smartphones where the user must perform a hand gesture to point their phone in the direction of the target device. We consider such an approach comparable to touching two electrodes, which is required for our protocol to work. However, most gesture-based solutions need to explicitly capture and understand the user's intention signaled by their gesture. Therefore, the gesture needs to be sensed by the devices, often requiring another auxiliary channel for that purpose (e.g., the audio channel in the case of [24]). Our solution, on the other hand, does not require recording any movements or gestures and has the advantage of using only one auxiliary channel—the human body.

Finally, a comprehensive comparison and survey of various secure device pairing methods can be found in [16]. Additionally, the study in [15] examines the influence of user perception, security needs, and other factors on the choice of device pairing methods.

**b) Applications of Body Channel Communication:**
The work most related to this paper in terms of application scenario is probably [20], which presents a system that allows a user to "wear" a unique key and unlock devices by simply touching them. The system consists of a wristwatch-like device that acts as a transmitter and houses a signal electrode. The electrode is in permanent contact with the user's skin around the wrist and emits data encoded in an electrical signal every time the user touches a receiver electrode with their finger. Via capacitive coupling, the data is transmitted to the receiver, which might be embedded in a door, smartphone, or remote control device. Although this novel unlocking mechanism bears a lot of potential in terms of usability, the paper does not draw conclusions about the security of such a system.

Another interesting, albeit non-security-focused, work is [28], which presents a near-field-sensing transceiver for intra-body communication between two or more devices and individuals. The proposed transceiver features an electric-field sensor suitable for the fields generated by the human body when subjected to an electric signal. The authors' experiments include two transceivers communicating with each other through one and two human bodies.

**X. Discussion**

**A. Body Position**
Body position and geometry can affect measurements, as shown in Section VIII-A. We designed and conducted experiments for two different body positions (seated and standing) to estimate how much the attenuation of the received signal varies. The study in [19] found that for different test subjects, the two positions exhibited an attenuation of the same magnitude, which aligns with our results. The authors tested several other body poses and even body movements and reported that the attenuation changes by around 5 dB for a transmission distance of 120 cm. Therefore, we conclude that body position has an insignificant impact on the use of capacitive coupling for our device pairing protocol.

**XI. Conclusion**
In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to device pairing that builds upon the core idea of using intra-body communication. We presented a protocol that allows two devices to securely agree on a mutual secret by sending messages through the body of a person who is in physical contact with both devices. Incorporating the human body as a transmission medium provides a communication channel that the devices can utilize to quickly and securely perform key confirmation without the need for certificates or shared knowledge. Moreover, the human body channel allows the devices to extract physical properties that are distinctive to this communication channel. We showed that these channel characteristics are sufficient to determine, with high probability, whether a message has traveled from one device to the other via the body channel. Most importantly, our experiments documented that the human body channel cannot be interfered with from the outside as long as there is a distance of at least 50 cm between the external signal source and the person pairing the devices.

Considering the increasing number of electronic devices we use daily, the problem of bootstrapping secure communication between two unauthenticated devices will arise more frequently. We believe that our device pairing protocol is an attractive solution to this problem and enables even novice users to pair devices with a task that requires very little involvement other than the touch of two electrodes.

Finally, our paper leaves the interesting question for future work: whether intra-body communication could be used to enhance security in other protocols, such as user authentication methods.
