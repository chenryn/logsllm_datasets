### Key Management

This paper does not address the well-known challenges of key management. Using a shared secret (referred to as \( K_m \) above) is reasonable for a prototype implementation, but large-scale deployment of shared key material—across implanted devices, hospitals, clinics, ambulances, and IMD programmers—may pose an unacceptable risk due to the ease with which an unauthorized party could decrypt transmissions if they obtain the key material. Although our recommendation to store \( K_m \) in secure hardware partially mitigates this risk under certain threat models, the simple scheme described above fails to address key revocation. This makes it unsuitable for scenarios where key material might be compromised. However, the proposed system remains no less secure than the open-access model of conventional systems.

An approach such as SKEYS [9] or key regression [6], with periodic updates of programmer keys, might mitigate the time window during which an attacker can use compromised keys, without significantly altering the overall model. Additionally, the offline nature of the transactions that need to be secured—such as an ambulance reaching an ICD patient in a remote setting—further complicates key management and revocation.

In the context of medical devices, security-related design choices must balance security, privacy, safety, and efficacy [10]. An ideal key management scheme for this context, which we present as an important open problem, must provide security and support privacy without hindering the operation of medical devices that are already known to provide safe and effective treatments.

### Zero-Power Sensible Key Exchange

We now present a key-distribution technique that complements both of our previous defensive techniques: distribution of a symmetric cryptographic key over a human-perceptible sensory channel. The primary goal is to allow the patient to detect a key exchange while it occurs.

#### Approach

The programmer initiates the protocol by supplying an unmodulated RF carrier signal that powers the passive component of the IMD. The IMD then generates a random value to be used as a session key and broadcasts it as a modulated sound wave. The amplitude of this sound wave is such that it can be easily received and demodulated by a reader with a microphone in contact with the patient’s body near the implantation site, but it cannot be heard over background noise at any appreciable distance from the patient, at least not without dedicated sensing equipment. The close proximity required ensures patient awareness and consent to the authentication attempt. Once the key exchange has been performed, RF communication can safely occur over a longer range without fear of eavesdropping.

#### Evaluation

We implemented our key exchange mechanism on the WISP using a 4 kHz carrier frequency. To effect key exchange, we used the same modulation scheme currently in use by our reader (2-FSK). We achieved a baud rate of 310 Bd, permitting transmission of a 128-bit nonce in 0.4 seconds. The components performed key exchange without drawing power from a battery, and the exchange was clearly audible, measuring 75 dB SPL through a human hand. When the microphone was not in contact with the skin, the sound pickup was too low to be measured on our meter (< 60 dB SPL). In our ad hoc experiments, transmission of the key was easy to feel with the hand but difficult to hear at a distance.

While these preliminary measurements show the plausibility of making eavesdropping difficult, further work is necessary to understand the relationship between sound levels and the ability to eavesdrop. Furthermore, an adversary may attempt to eavesdrop on the electromagnetic emanations [14] of the electrical components that generate the sound rather than on the sound itself. Radio shielding in the form of a Faraday cage or the use of non-electromagnetic, optical links between security-sensitive modules may help to reduce these unintended emanations. An alternative approach for sensible key exchange might be for the programmer to transmit the key to the IMD over an audio channel, or for the final key to be derived from keys sent in both directions.

### Conclusion and Future Work

Our investigation shows that an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is potentially susceptible to malicious attacks that violate the privacy of patient information and medical telemetry and may experience malicious alteration to the integrity of information or state, including patient data and therapy settings for when and how shocks are administered. Moreover, standard approaches for security and access control may not always be suitable for IMDs due to tensions between security (e.g., access for pre-authorized parties only) and safety (e.g., access for previously unauthorized parties in emergency circumstances) [10]. Our three new methods for zero-power security (zero-power notification, zero-power authentication, and sensible key exchange) implemented on a prototype are steps toward mitigating this tension without simultaneously drawing power from a battery.

#### Reflections on Existing and Next-Generation IMD Technologies

Evaluating the security and privacy of an IMD requires skills from many disciplines, including security, cryptography, cardiology, signal processing, radio communications, and antenna design. Next-generation IMDs, which may incorporate greater communications capabilities and be more networked, should not rely solely upon external mechanisms like firewalls on external devices and controlled distribution of commercial programmers. Firewalls on wireless programmers or Internet-connected at-home monitors do not immediately protect the wireless links themselves and may not protect the integrity of communications. Controlled distribution of programmers cannot prevent insider access, and the availability of software radios can make the possession of a commercial wireless reprogrammer unnecessary. In essence, device manufacturers should not view external devices, like commercial programmers, as part of the trusted computing base for IMDs.

Additionally, the trend toward increasing nominal read range allows flexible home monitoring for better safety but also increases the exposure of devices to attacks from nearby adversaries. Finally, for economic and safety reasons, certain IMDs typically contain non-rechargeable batteries and require surgery for replacement. Conventional approaches for security and privacy may facilitate trivial denial-of-service attacks against these batteries.

#### Future Directions and Open Problems

Critical systems that rely on computing devices are already designed with great care. When these systems include wireless computing devices, additional precautions are necessary to ensure that the computing devices appropriately balance safety with convenience and do not introduce unacceptable risks. Medical device design is one such situation. Our research into implantable cardioverter defibrillators has demonstrated failure modes that do not appear to be addressed by some present-day design strategies and certification processes.

Our work leaves open several research problems. While there are a few obvious minor next steps, our research calls for broader and innovative action. In concert with Halperin et al. [10], this work highlights the need for a principled and deeper investigation into prevention mechanisms, detection mechanisms, audit mechanisms, deterrents, and methods that enhance patient awareness and ensure consent. Moreover, a fundamental challenge will be to develop methods that appropriately balance security and privacy with traditional goals such as safety and effectiveness. Our work provides a foundation for these explorations, on top of which we hope to see much subsequent innovation. Such innovations will become more crucial as the technologies and capabilities of implantable medical devices continue to evolve.
