To reduce operational costs, members of large Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) often egress the majority, if not all, of their high-volume destination traffic via (mostly bilateral) peering connections, while using transit for low-volume but domain-heavy prefixes. Notably, between 25% and 50% of the top-10k prefix lists can be reached via multilateral peering. This finding underscores the importance of Route Server connections, especially for new IXP members.

### 6.3 Missing Routes

To identify which routes were unavailable, we mapped normalized prefixes to Autonomous Systems (ASes) using a longest-prefix match on the previously mentioned IP-to-AS dataset from CAIDA. We further classified each origin AS using CAIDA’s AS Classification dataset [15]. We refined this classification using lists of Tier 1 Networks [77] and Hypergiants [12].

Figure 18 illustrates the number of missing normalized prefixes (y-axis) originated by ASes of different classes (x-axis) for IPv4 (bottom) and IPv6 (top). For IPv4, most of the missing /24 prefixes belong to content providers/hypergiants. Specifically, more than half of these prefixes in both classes are attributed to Amazon's AS14618 and AS16509. Notably, most of the missing prefixes for Amazon do not see any peering LAN traffic (regardless of the business relationship) throughout our measurement period. Since many of these prefixes are unique to the traffic-based prefix ranking, we suspect that our vantage point has access to routes announced via private peering on dedicated connections, thus remaining hidden from the peering LAN.

Excluding Amazon, the most prominent class for both IPv4 and IPv6 is Transit ASes. The individual contributions by single ASes are more uniformly distributed; out of the 61 and 231 total ASes contributing to the IPv4 and IPv6 Transit AS class, the top ASes contribute no more than 21 and 29 prefixes, respectively. Additionally, we observe that the vast majority of the prefixes belonging to Transit ASes are only present in the domain-based top list but not in the traffic-based top list. In summary, our observations suggest that ASes can offload high-volume prefixes to peering links by joining an IXP, but they still require transit to reach the heavy tail of (potentially low-traffic) domains.

### 6.4 Limitations

Next, we discuss the limitations and the generalization of our findings:

**Multilateral Peering:**
We analyzed Route Servers of different IXPs based on separate snapshots generated over seven days. Thus, our observations may be biased by sequences of high-frequency updates, as described by Ariemma et al. [5]. However, discussions with some IXP operators who provided Route Server snapshots indicated no unusual behavior during the snapshot period. Nevertheless, a single snapshot might miss unstable routing information, as many prefixes can only be seen when aggregating updates over time.

**Bilateral Peering:**
Our analysis of bilateral peering reachability relied on sampled peering LAN traffic data and inferred business relationships. While we used an entire week of traffic data to partially overcome the problem of missing traffic for existing routes, we likely still missed some routes due to either genuine lack of traffic or small amounts of traffic not captured by the sampling algorithm. Although we improved the coverage of inferred business relationships, we cannot guarantee the correctness of the business inference algorithm. Both algorithms have been shown to provide high-quality inferences on public data [33,47], but their performance in our context could be impaired [64].

**Private Peering:**
For inferring private peering routes, we used a very small set of looking glasses and queried them restrictively. Our findings regarding summed reachability should be considered a lower bound. If we had a significantly higher number of vantage points and could trigger queries at a high rate, the number of private peering prefixes would increase, leading to higher estimates for total achievable reachability.

**Regional Importance Bias:**
The datasets used to infer peering relations and qualify the importance of IPs and prefixes (see Sections 5 and 6) are biased towards the European service region. While it is necessary for the conducted analysis to compare reachability at IXPs and relevance (ISP data set and DNS) in the same region, this may not apply to other regions. Different cultures may exhibit unique eyeball behaviors, leading to different prefixes in the lower part of the top-10k ranking. Address resolution is often location-skewed (e.g., due to DNS load balancing), so our domain-based ranking is likely biased towards normalized prefixes primarily used in the European region. While unmatching biases (e.g., comparing American top lists to European IXP) may lower overall top list coverage, we do not expect considerable differences.

### 7 Discussion

Our results suggest that networks peering at one of the larger IXPs can indeed move most traffic to bilateral peerings, yet (especially for IPv6) not all prefixes serving a high number of domains are reachable via peering. While assessing the quality of available peering relationships (i.e., capacity and latency guarantees) goes beyond the scope of this work, previous studies have hinted at certain benefits [2]. For example, Schlinker et al. [69] showed that latencies for 10% of Facebook's traffic can decrease by up to 10ms when switching from transit to peering routes.

The ability to serve many high-volume prefixes via bilateral peering at IXPs is strongly correlated with the observation that Hypergiants—large content providers such as Google, Facebook, or Amazon [12]—interconnect at tens (if not hundreds) of IXPs (see PeeringDB). According to Pujol et al. [65], these relatively few Hypergiants can be responsible for up to 80% of all ingress traffic of large eyeball networks.

Similar to Hypergiants, the routes of many lower-tier networks are also available via peering. Broadly announcing their routes allows them to reduce the volume of ingress traffic delivered via some of their transit providers. Over time, this approach can transform an asymmetric traffic ratio into a symmetric one, enabling these networks to re-negotiate their previous transit providers into peering relationships.

In contrast, many domain-based top prefixes belong to large transit providers and Tier-1s. To reach these prefixes, IXP members often still rely on transit.

**Large Networks and Hypergiants:**
These entities have established thousands of peering connections [6] and use sophisticated traffic engineering strategies [70,78] among those connections. Their egress traffic mapping is automated, making the addition of new peers straightforward, leading to constant growth of their peering edges and a continuous reduction in dependence on transit connections.

**Small (Access) Networks:**
These networks often rely on a few border routers operated manually by a small group of network engineers. Adding new bilateral peers poses a challenge in terms of resources and network complexity. Despite our findings, many such networks may only peer with a Route Server and a few carefully selected bilateral peers. For them, the reduced supplier cost that comes with sophisticated peering is often not worth the increased operational complexity.

**Medium-Sized Networks:**
(e.g., smaller national service providers) fall between these two extremes. While many have not yet automated their egress traffic mapping or peer acquisition, they are typically run by competent IT staff capable of anticipating the benefits of a particular peer. Transitioning from a few expensive yet feature-rich routers to a distributed fleet of cheaper routers (with potentially partial visibility) can allow these networks to quickly scale their peering edge, taking full advantage of the opportunities provided by large IXPs.

### 8 Conclusion

In this paper, we analyzed the routes available via multilateral, bilateral, and private peering. For multilateral peering, we analyzed Route Server snapshots from eight of the world’s largest peering LANs and showed that most of their routes lead to out-of-continent locations via three or more AS hops. While remote peering might be a major contributor to the geographic distance of Route Server destinations, we observed that both close and distant IXP members provide lengthy, unattractive routes to the Route Server. Comparing these findings to peering LAN traffic, obtained through a collaboration with one large IXP, we saw that mostly one-hop routes saw substantial traffic. In fact, 25% and 77% of IPv4 and IPv6 Route Server prefixes with at least four hop long paths saw no traffic at all. This indicates that even though Route Servers provide many routes, most IXP members only make use of local routes.

We then used two heuristic-based methodologies to infer bilateral and private peering routes from the IXP’s peering LAN traffic. During our inferences, we carefully isolated transit connections established over the peering LAN—a phenomenon previously reported by Ager et al. [1]. Based on our inference, we observed that at least 19.8%, 57.1%, and 57.4% (37.3%, 37.4%, 37.8%) of all routed IPv4 (IPv6) address space can be reached at our IXP via multilateral, bilateral, and private peering, respectively. These results provide practical contrast to the 70+ % reachability theoretically calculated by Böttger et al. [10]. Finally, we show that almost all of the top 10k egress prefixes of a large European eyeball network can be reached via bilateral peerings. In contrast, up to 15% of top 10k domain-serving prefixes cannot be reached via any type of peering at our IXP. Notably, most of these prefixes belong to large transit and Tier 1 providers.
