## SCADA Industry
**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

### Marketplace Overview
- Primarily focused on the sale of ICS (Industrial Control Systems) equipment over software sales.
- Active merger and acquisition activity.
- Highly regionalized.

**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

## What is the Human Machine Interface (HMI)?
- The main hub for managing and operating control systems.
- Collects data from the control systems.
- Provides a visualization of the system architecture.
- Alarms operators and sends notifications.
- Should be operated on isolated and trusted networks, though this is often not the case.

**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

## Why Target the Human Machine Interface (HMI)?
- To control the targeted critical infrastructure.
- To harvest information about the system architecture.
- To disable or deceive alarm and notification systems.
- To physically damage SCADA equipment.

## Malware Targeting HMI Solutions
- **Stuxnet**
  - First malware created to target ICS environments.
  - Abused vulnerabilities:
    - Siemens SIMATIC STEP 7 DLL Hijacking Vulnerability (ICSA-12-205-02)
    - Siemens WinCC Insecure SQL Server Authentication (ICSA-12-205-01)

- **BlackEnergy**
  - Ongoing sophisticated malware campaign compromising ICS environments.

## ICS-CERT
- An organization within the Department of Homeland Security.
- Focus areas:
  - Responding to and analyzing control systems-related incidents.
  - Conducting vulnerability and malware analysis.
  - Providing onsite incident response services.
  - Coordinating the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities and associated mitigations.
- In 2015, ICS-CERT responded to 295 incidents and handled 486 vulnerability disclosures.

## Critical Infrastructure Attacks
**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

### Targeting Water Utilities
- Compromised an internet-facing AS/400 system responsible for:
  - Network routing.
  - Manipulation of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).
  - Management of customer PII and billing information.
- Altered settings related to water flow and the amount of chemicals in the water supply.
- Four separate connections to the AS/400 over a 60-day period.
- Actors' IP addresses linked to previous hacktivist activities.

### Targeting Power Plants
- On December 24, 2015, Ukrainian companies experienced unscheduled power outages affecting over 225,000 customers.
  - Caused by external malicious actors.
  - Multiple coordinated attacks within 30 minutes of each other.
- Used remote administration tools and/or remote industrial control system (ICS) client software to control breakers.
- Deployed KillDisk to overwrite Windows-based human-machine interface systems, disrupting restoration efforts.

### Targeting Railway and Mining Industry
- Malware similar to the power incident was found in attacks against a Ukrainian railway and a Ukrainian mining company (November–December 2015).
- Overlap between the samples found in the Ukrainian power incident and those used against the Ukrainian mining company.
  - Malware leveraged: BlackEnergy/KillDisk.
  - Shared infrastructure and naming conventions.

## Prevalent Vulnerability Types
**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

## Current State of HMI Solutions
- Not built with security in mind.
- Have not benefited from the evolution of secure SDL (Software Development Lifecycle).
- Mitigations against advanced attacks are often disabled (e.g., ASLR, SafeSEH, Stack Cookies).
- Poor design and developer assumptions.
- Lack of understanding of real operating environments.
  - Not on isolated or trusted networks.
  - Continually being interconnected.

## Common Problems with HMI
- Memory Corruption
- Credential Management
- Insecure Defaults
- Authentication/Authorization
- Injection
- Other

### Injections
- 9% of identified vulnerabilities.
- Common vulnerability types:
  - SQL Injection
  - Code Injection
  - OS Command Injection
  - Command Injection
- Zero Day Initiative case study: Cogent DataHub Gamma Command Injection, Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.

**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

### Cogent DataHub Case Study
- ICS-CERT states: "An attacker can turn on an insecure processing mode in the web server, which subsequently allows the attacker to send arbitrary script commands to the server."
- Identifiers:
  - CVE-2015-3789
  - ZDI-15-438
  - ICSA-15-246-01
- CVSS: 7.5
- Disclosure Timeline:
  - 2015-06-02: Reported to vendor
  - 2015-09-08: Coordinated release
- Credit:
  - Discovered by: Anonymous
  - Disclosed by: Zero Day Initiative

**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

### Cogent DataHub Overview
- Gamma is DataHub’s scripting language.
- A dynamically-typed, interpreted programming language designed for rapid development of control and user interface applications.
- Syntax similar to C and C++, but with built-in features that make it suitable for developing sophisticated real-time systems.

**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

### Attacker-Supplied Script Evaluation
- Flaw exists within the `EvalExpression` method, allowing execution of attacker-controlled code.
- Remotely accessible through the AJAX facility, listening on TCP port 80.
- Supplying a specially crafted Gamma script allows for the execution of arbitrary OS commands.

### Vulnerable Code
- [Code Snippet]

**Copyright 2016, Trend Micro Inc.**

### Exploitation Steps
1. Send a request to any Gamma script to load necessary libraries.
2. Call `AJAXSupport.AllowExpressions` and set `allow_any_expression` to `True`.
3. Call `AJAXSupport.EvalExpression` method and pass in the script to be executed.
