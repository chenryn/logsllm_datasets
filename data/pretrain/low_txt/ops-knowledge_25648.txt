I have a CherryPy web application running on a virtual Ubuntu Linux server and am in the process of migrating it to a second, more powerful server. Both servers seem to have CherryPy 3.2 installed; I used `apt-get` to install it on the new server. However, the newer server does not appear to have the `auth_digest` module, which I use for authentication. This module is present in the CherryPy egg on the older server.

**How can I update my copy of CherryPy on the new server to include this module?**

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, I downloaded the latest CherryPy source tarball (which appears to be a minor version or two more recent than what is available via `apt-get`). Then, I used the `setup.py` script included in the tarball to install CherryPy. This newer version includes the `auth_digest` module, thus solving the problem.
