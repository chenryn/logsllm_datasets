### Monitoring Techniques for Runtime Analysis of Web Process Execution

#### 70. Web Services and Workflow Systems
Web services can be orchestrated with hard-coded applications or through workflows. Workflow management systems (WfMS) are capable of integrating business objects to set up e-services (web services) in a remarkably short time and at a low cost.

**Workflow Management System (WfMS):**
- **Definition:** A system or set of tools that completely defines, manages, and executes a workflow or web process.
- **Integration:** Business objects can be integrated to create e-services quickly and cost-effectively.

#### 71. Web Processes and Workflows
**Comparison:**
- **Web Processes/Workflows Components:**
  - Route
  - Decision
  - People/Role
  - Information
  - Routing rules
  - Decisions
  - Participants
  - Information

**Example:**
- **Organization A, B, C:**
  - Tasks: t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8
  - Activities: Set_Data, DB_Access, Manager, Lab Tech, GET_Seq, Lab TechII

**A Workflow Management System (WfMS):**
- **Definition:** A system or set of tools that completely defines, manages, and executes a workflow or web process.

#### 72. Processes
**Abstract Representation:**
- A process is an abstract representation of a business process.
- **Example:**
  - **BarnesBookPurchase Process:**
    - **Organization A, B, C:**
      - Tasks: t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8
      - Activities: Setup, Test Quality, Get Sequences, Sequence Process, Prepare Sample, Prepare Clones, Assembly, Processing Report

#### 73. Process Execution
- **Execution:**
  - Once the design of a process is completed, it can be executed.
  - **Methods:**
    - Hard-coded applications
    - Workflows
  - **Enactment:**
    - Workflows are enacted using a WfMS or other process orchestration technology.

**WfMS:**
- **Definition:** A system or set of tools that completely defines, manages, and executes a workflow.

#### 74. Process Composition Challenges
- **Challenges:**
  - Discovery of web services
  - Integration of web services
  - End-to-end process analysis
  - Correctness/validation
  - Performance

#### 76. Web Services: Discovery and Integration
**Introduction:**
- E-services (web services) are the next wave of internet-based business applications.
- **Authors:**
  - Jorge Cardoso, Christoph Bussler, Amit Sheth, Dieter Fensel
  - Affiliations: LSDIS Lab, University of Georgia, Oracle Corporation, Universit√§t Innsbruck, Semagix, Inc.

**Discovery and Integration:**
- **Discovery:**
  - Locate web services with desired functionality, operational metrics, and interfaces.
- **Integration:**
  - Resolve structural and semantic differences to facilitate interoperability.

**New Requirements:**
- **Discovery:**
  - Analyze thousands of web services.
  - Evaluate Quality of Service (QoS) metrics.
- **Integration:**
  - Ensure interface interoperability.
  - Resolve structural and semantic heterogeneity.

**Our Approach:**
- Use ontologies to describe web services and their interfaces.
- Employ a QoS model to describe operational metrics.

**Road Map:**
- Web Service Specification
- Interface Specification
- Quality of Service (QoS)
- Web Process/Workflow Composition
- Discovery
- Integration

**Semantic Specification:**
- Importance of web services recognized by academia and commercial organizations.
- **Specification Languages:**
  - Declarative and structured data (e.g., WSDL, XLANG)
  - Semantic orientation (e.g., DAML-S)

**DAML-S:**
- **Introduction:**
  - Upper ontology for web services.
  - Supports process description, service advertisement, discovery, selection, composition, interoperation, invocation, execution, and monitoring.
- **Ontologies:**
  - Service Profiles
  - Process Models
  - Service Grounding

**Service Profile:**
- Details about a service, including inputs, outputs, preconditions, and effects.

**Web Services Interfaces:**
- **Enhancement:**
  - Associate inputs and outputs with ontological concepts to resolve structural and semantic heterogeneity.
- **Mapping:**
  - Increase the description of interfaces by associating them with ontological concepts.

**What is an Ontology?**
- **Definition:**
  - A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse.
  - Includes terms, definitions, and inter-relationships to impose structure and constrain interpretations.

**Examples:**
- Coordinates{x, y}
- Area {name}
