### Urban/Metropolitan Area A-89
**January 2007**
**Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards**

#### Tactical Interoperable Communications Peer Review

The Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) Peer Review identified several areas for improvement in the Urban Area (UA). Specifically, the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are not standardized across the UA, and a specific time for training on these SOPs has not been identified. While the UA has implemented the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) more than six months ago across all disciplines, some deficiencies were observed during an exercise, such as the late designation of a Communications Unit Leader.

**Recommendations:**
- **Standardize Regional Policies:** Develop and agree upon regional policies, practices, and procedures.
- **NIMS/ICS Compliance:** Ensure that regional SOPs for command and control are NIMS/ICS-compliant.
- **Training and Exercises:** Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs, including communications unit implementation, to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Intermediate Implementation**

#### Multi-Agency Communications

While multi-agency communications occur daily within the UA's shared systems, Dallas/Fort Worth officials reported challenges with multijurisdictional/multicounty interoperability. The After Action Report highlighted the lack of designated interoperability talk groups during the TICP validation exercise, leading to technical and procedural issues.

**Recommendations:**
- **Channel Programming:** Ensure correct interoperability channels are programmed into gateways and that radio channel programming documentation is available.
- **Regular Testing:** Continue to regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional communications interoperability resources.
- **Exercise Inclusion:** Include communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

**Technology Overview:**
- The UA uses VHF with both analog and Project 25 (P25)-compliant radio systems, UHF for the City of Dallas, and 800 MHz band with M/A-COM and Motorola 800 MHz trunked equipment.
- The Department of Justice has implemented a two-channel interoperability system consisting of VHF P25-compatible repeaters in Dallas and Fort Worth.
- Several gateways and consoles are available for patching communications resources in the UA.

Due to frequency limitations, significant changes to interoperable communications are currently limited. The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCT COG) aims to expand TICP to surrounding counties and smaller jurisdictions, including schools, universities, hospitals, and secondary public safety answering points. They also plan to create more mutual aid talk groups on the Fort Worth 800 MHz trunked system.

### Houston, TX
**January 2007**
**Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard**

#### Summary
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures:** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

**Houston Urban Area (UA)**
- Includes the City of Houston and five surrounding counties: Harris, Montgomery, Fort Bend, Brazoria, and Galveston.

#### Governance: Intermediate Implementation

The Houston UA Working Group Executive Committee established the Regional Interoperable Communications Committee (RICC), which advises on interoperable communications issues. However, decision-making authority in the governance structure is not clearly defined in the TICP. Strategic planning is critical as the region upgrades its 800 MHz system and migrates to a 700 MHz system.

**Recommendations:**
- **Formal Charter:** Establish a formal charter to clarify roles and responsibilities.
- **Agreements:** Document and formalize agreements among participating agencies.
- **Strategic Planning:** Develop and document a strategic plan for approval by all participating agencies.
- **Long-Term Funding:** Develop a long-term funding strategy for sustainable interoperable communications.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation

The TICP provides the first formal regional communications SOPs for the Houston UA. The UA has implemented NIMS/ICS through an executive order and ensured mandated training and certification. Exercise evaluators noted the effective use of NIMS/ICS during the TICP validation exercise.

**Recommendations:**
- **Documentation and Training:** Document and distribute regional communications interoperability SOPs and conduct regular training.
- **Advanced Training:** Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage: Established Implementation

Multi-agency communications in the Houston UA are primarily provided through two major shared systems: the Harris County 800 MHz and the City of Houston UHF. A permanent fixed gateway links these systems, and the TICP validation exercise demonstrated effective command and line-level communications. However, broader inclusion of state and federal agencies would enhance interoperability.

**Recommendations:**
- **Interoperability Component:** Continue to include interoperability as a component in all future exercises and day-to-day activities.
- **Inclusion of Agencies:** Consider including additional state and federal agencies in future exercises and daily use.

**Technology Overview:**
- The Harris County 800 MHz system supports the most users.
- The City of Houston operates on a large, conventional UHF system and routinely communicates with other agencies.
- Several mobile gateways and many channels can be connected via console patches, and radio caches are available.
- The Harris County 800 MHz system is being upgraded to a Project 25 700/800 MHz integrated voice and data system.

### San Antonio, TX
**January 2007**
**Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard**

#### Summary
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures:** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Intermediate Implementation

**San Antonio Urban Area (UA)**
- Includes the City of San Antonio, Bexar County, Comal County, and the cities and jurisdictions within those counties.

#### Governance: Intermediate Implementation

The San Antonio UA Working Group (SUAWG) was established in October 2005 and has a formalized communications subcommittee. The UA has a mix of formal and informal partnerships, including a regional mutual aid agreement involving 71 agencies and the U.S. Department of the Army. A strategic plan for interoperable communications is under development, but a finalized plan acceptable to area first responders is still pending.

**Recommendations:**
- **Formal Charter:** Distribute a formal charter to clarify roles and responsibilities.
- **Agreement Review:** Establish processes to review and update agreements every 3 to 5 years.
- **Strategic Plan:** Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan with participant approval.
- **Funding Strategy:** Identify long-term sustainable funding for communications interoperability.
- **Champion Leadership:** Identify champions to support the regional strategic plan and involve senior government leadership.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation

The San Antonio UA incorporated existing communications interoperability policies, practices, and procedures into the TICP. Despite distributing and training on the SOPs, participants experienced procedural problems during the TICP validation exercise. The UA has implemented NIMS/ICS within the last year and is making efforts to attain NIMS compliance.

**Recommendations:**
- **Update TICP:** Ensure the TICP is updated and aligned with regional communications interoperability SOPs.
- **Develop and Distribute SOPs:** Develop and distribute regional communications interoperability SOPs and conduct regular training.
- **Training and Exercises:** Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.
