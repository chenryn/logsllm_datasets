### Nominal STC Vdd and Safe Operating Points

The nominal supply voltage (Vdd) in standard threshold conditions (STC) is sufficiently high to ensure a safe operating point across all tiles. There is no need to adjust the Vdd of individual tiles based on their VddM IN. While the general trends observed under near-threshold computing (NTC) are similar to those under STC, the performance loss (measured in millions of instructions per second, MIPS) incurred by single-voltage-single-frequency (SVSF) operation is significantly less.

### VII. Model Validation

#### 1. Validation of Model Parameters
Our initial validation of VARIUS-NTV involves verifying the parameters used and comparing the results with an experimental chip. VARIUS-NTV builds on the VARIUS variation and timing error model, which was calibrated using experimental data from Friedberg et al. [17] and Razor [16], and validated with error rates in logic and memory [37].

To validate the new VARIUS-NTV formulas, we first examined the threshold voltage (Vth), which is a complex function of Vdd, effective channel length (Leff), and other technology parameters. We obtained a version of the 12nm Predictive Technology Model (PTM) from Yu Cao at Arizona State University [32]. We compared the Vth values generated by VARIUS-NTV to those generated by the BSIM analytical model [5] and HSPICE. The Vth values from VARIUS-NTV closely matched those from both HSPICE and BSIM, with less than 1% error over the designated Vdd range. The primary source of discrepancy is the accuracy of modeling the drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) effect.

Next, we used the Vth values from VARIUS-NTV to generate values for gate delay and static power. We compared these values to HSPICE measurements of a FO4 inverter chain. The delay and static power scaling trends of VARIUS-NTV followed HSPICE within a 10% error margin for our Vdd range.

#### 2. Comparison to Silicon Measurements
To further validate VARIUS-NTV, we compared its outputs to the variation measurements from Intel’s 80-Core TeraFLOPS processor [11]. For this, we experimented with a 12mm × 20mm chip that mimics the TeraFLOPS processor, where each core (referred to as a tile) has two floating-point units, a 3KB instruction memory, and a 2KB data memory. According to the chip micrograph, the 80 cores are organized into 10 rows and 8 columns. To match their technology parameters, we adapted VARIUS-NTV to a 65nm CMOS technology with a nominal Vdd of 1.2V.

Figure 8 in [11] shows the measured variation in core frequency (fMAX) for the 80 cores of a single die at 50°C and Vdd = 0.8V. At 0.8V, the authors report a ratio of the highest core frequency to the lowest core frequency of 1.62.

We replicated the conditions of these measurements to the extent possible. We generated VARIUS-NTV frequency maps for 100 sample dies, assuming a (σ/µ)Vth of 5% for the 65nm technology, with an equal contribution of random and systematic variation. The histogram of the resulting ratios of the highest core frequency to the lowest core frequency, as generated by VARIUS-NTV, is shown in Figure 10(a). The histogram indicates that VARIUS-NTV produces an average value of approximately 1.48 for the frequency ratio, with a 95% confidence interval of (1.452, 1.483).

Figure 10(b) shows the frequency distribution of the cores in one of the dies, as generated by VARIUS-NTV at 0.8V. For this particular die, the ratio of the highest core frequency to the lowest core frequency is approximately 1.4, which is very similar to the data presented in Figure 8 of [11].

### VIII. Related Work
Several microarchitectural models analyze the impact of process variations on the frequency and power of processors and memories at a level useful to microarchitects. These include works by Humenay et al. [20], Liang and Brooks [25], Marculescu and Talpes [27], Romanescu et al. [35], and Sarangi et al. [37] (on which this work builds). However, these models apply only to STC and not to NTC.

A few papers provide a good description of the challenges and issues at NTC [7], [13], [28]. There are many other works related to evaluating the impact of process variation, mostly in STC environments. Some of the most relevant works include:

- Humenay et al. [20] demonstrate that within-die (WID) process variations lead to considerable performance and power consumption asymmetry among the cores in a chip multiprocessor (CMP). They propose per-core adaptive body biasing (ABB) and adaptive supply voltage (ASV) to minimize such asymmetry.
- Donald and Martonosi [12] analyze core-to-core power variations in a CMP due to WID variation and propose turning off cores when they consume excessive leakage power to maximize chip-wide performance/power.
- Herbert and Marculescu [18] examine the impact of core size on the throughput of a fixed-area chip in the presence of WID variations. They find that smaller cores (thus more cores per chip) running at independent frequencies (f) lead to higher throughput than larger ones.
- Li and Martinez [23] propose optimizing the number of active cores and their Vdds and fs jointly while running a workload on a CMP, applying dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) chip-wide rather than independently per core.
- Rangan et al. [33] propose a throughput-driven scheduling scheme to ensure that a variation-affected chip performs very close to a perfect chip operating at the average frequency of the former.
- Rotem et al. [36] analyze the impact of single and multiple voltage and frequency domains in a CMP environment, considering power delivery limitations. They propose a clustered topology to maximize performance.
- Teodorescu and Torrellas [39] examine the impact of process scheduling in the context of a manycore with variation and provide heuristics to schedule the workload for performance or power efficiency.

### IX. Conclusion
To address process variations at the architecture level in NTC, this paper presents the first microarchitectural model of process variations for NTC, called VARIUS-NTV. This model extends an existing variation model for STC and models how variations affect the frequency and power consumed by cores and memories in an NTC manycore, as well as the timing and stability faults in SRAM cells at NTC. Key aspects include:

- Adopting a gate-delay model and an SRAM cell type tailored to NTC.
- Modeling SRAM failure modes emerging at NTC.
- Accounting for the impact of leakage in SRAM failure models.

We evaluated a simulated 11nm manycore at both NTC and STC. Our results showed that expected process variations induce higher differences in frequency and power at NTC than at STC. For example, the maximum difference in tile frequency within a chip is approximately 3.7x at NTC and only 2.3x at STC. We also evaluated different core-tiling organizations and configurations of on-chip Vdd- and f-domains, showing that variation management is more crucial at NTC. Finally, we validated our model against an experimental 80-core prototype chip.
