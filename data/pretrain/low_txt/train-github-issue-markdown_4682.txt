- I commit to helping with one of the options listed above.

### Example Code
- No code is provided, as this is a documentation correction (possibly).

### Description
In the FastAPI documentation, under the "Python Types/Pydantic models" section, it states:
> Pydantic is a Python library to perform data validation.
>
> You declare the "shape" of the data as classes with attributes.
>
> And each attribute has a type.
>
> Then you create an instance of that class with some values, and it will validate the values, convert them to the appropriate type (if necessary), and give you an object with all the data.

However, the Pydantic documentation, in the "Models" section, notes that:
> Pydantic is primarily a parsing library, **not a validation library**. Validation is a means to an end: building a model which conforms to the types and constraints provided.

Given this, the FastAPI documentation could be revised as follows:
> Pydantic is a Python library to perform data parsing.
>
> You declare the "shape" of the data as classes with attributes.
>
> And each attribute has a type.
>
> Then you create an instance of that class with some values, and it will parse the values, convert them to the appropriate type (if necessary), and give you an object with all the data.

I did not submit a pull request immediately because I believe the current wording may have been chosen for clarity. However, I think it is important to be technically accurate.
