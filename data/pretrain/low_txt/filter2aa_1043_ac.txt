### Commission Will Be Generally Incapable of Policing Noncompliant Devices

#### D. The Commission Must Implement an Effective Enforcement Regime

The Commission has a longstanding, legally mandated obligation to protect incumbent licensed services from interference. Therefore, if the Commission authorizes TV band devices to operate on an unlicensed basis in the band, it must implement an effective enforcement regime. As previously discussed, once these devices are released into the market, the Commission will have limited power to prevent interference through regulatory means. In the absence of a regulatory solution to the problems that arise after unlicensed devices are released, the Commission must impose proper technical requirements.

The Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPRM) fails to address any means by which the Commission might enforce the prohibition on unlicensed devices interfering with licensed services. At a minimum, the Commission should require TV band devices to be connected to the Internet and incorporate an automatic identification and shutoff function so that the device would cease operation if it is determined to be causing interference. The successful development of such a technological enforcement regime, which requires further study and development, is essential to protect the public’s over-the-air television service.

### Given the Many Interference Concerns and the Lack of Sufficient Enforcement Mechanisms, the Commission Should Proceed Cautiously with Proposals to Allow TV Band Devices to Share the Broadcast Spectrum

In light of the severe interference that new TV band devices may cause to the viewing public, the Commission must proceed cautiously. At a minimum, certain safeguards and limits, as described below, must be placed on any device allowed to operate in the television spectrum. These protections include:

- An absolute prohibition on personal/portable devices.
- Use of a robust and reliable geolocation method to keep TV band devices from operating within the protected contour of co-channel and adjacent-channel television stations.
- Adoption of stricter out-of-band emission limits.
- Exclusive licensing of TV band devices.

Further information about these protections and the additional work needed to achieve them is detailed below.

At the outset, the adoption of these baseline safeguards is fully consistent with the Commission’s goal of providing new broadband services, especially to rural and underserved areas of the United States, which MSTV and NAB fully support. Notably, it is through fixed broadband access that the Commission can further this goal; personal/portable devices will not deliver broadband access to rural families. If the Commission’s proposal to allow TV band devices to operate in the spectrum is truly about solving the broadband problem in America, especially for rural areas, the Commission will be able to accomplish this goal by authorizing the operation of fixed devices while fully protecting the American public’s over-the-air television service.

#### A. By Authorizing Only Fixed TV Band Devices to Operate, Accompanied by Proper Protections, the Commission Can Promote a Broadband Plan Without Endangering Television Reception

MSTV and NAB understand that IEEE 802.22 will propose a fixed operation approach that incorporates key protections aimed at preventing the four types of interference discussed above in Section III. As a general matter, MSTV and NAB urge the Commission to formulate rules implementing IEEE 802.22’s plan for fixed devices.

These protections should include a prohibition on the operation of devices within the contour of both co- and first adjacent channels. Such a prohibition can only be achieved through a rigorous combination of geolocation (using GPS), professional installation of the fixed TV band devices, and frequency sensing (which is utilized as an added, and not the sole, protection and which also would help prevent interference with cordless microphones). To implement geolocation, the Commission must require fixed devices to utilize outdoor antennas, given that GPS is not reliable indoors.

Additional research and testing will be necessary to implement a geolocation protection system. Importantly, the key to geolocation is access to a reliable database. Thus, a correct, post-transition database will be necessary for all stations, including LPTV, translators, and cable head ends. While the Commission has proposed a final DTV Table, that table will continue to be revised up until the transition to DTV. Of course, there will also be ongoing changes in station parameters once the transition is complete, necessitating a means of keeping the database up to date. Moreover, the transition for Class A, LPTV, and TV translator stations will not be completed by February 18, 2009. Accordingly, there may be considerable movement in channel use for several years after the transition, and devices will have to protect both analog and digital operations of Class A, LPTV, and TV translator operations during this period. As also discussed in Section III, proper out-of-band emission limits will need to be determined and adopted; the Part 15.209 emission limits are ineffective at preventing interference.

#### B. Personal/Portable Devices Are Not Compatible with Existing Operations in the Broadcast Spectrum

The Commission’s decision in this proceeding to permit only fixed low-power devices to operate in the broadcast spectrum was certainly the proper course of action. Personal/portable devices, defined as devices that operate independently of a base station, such as mesh networks and WiFi cards, are extremely problematic and should not be allowed to operate in the television band because the Commission will be unable to ensure that harmful interference to licensed services does not occur.

Simply put, no method exists today (or in the foreseeable future) to prevent interference from personal/portable devices to consumers’ reception of DTV services. For example, IEEE 802 has not conducted any studies on this issue, as it was beyond the scope of the Project Authorization Request which created the IEEE 802.22 Working Group, nor has any other IEEE 802 working group examined this issue. Therefore, there are currently no suggested rules for how portable/personal devices would be able to operate without causing harmful interference.

As discussed above in Section III, MSTV’s study showed significant co- and adjacent channel interference from personal/portable devices operating at 100 mW. Sensing alone will be ineffective, as demonstrated, to prevent any devices (fixed or personal/portable) from operating within the protected contour of a co- or adjacent channel. But because of the limitations of GPS, the geolocation method proposed to keep fixed devices from operating within a station’s co- or adjacent channel’s contour does not work on indoor consumer devices. Once such operation occurs, it could prevent reception of DTV signals for miles. Out-of-band emissions would also have a serious effect on reception, as the personal/portable devices would often operate in very close proximity to consumers’ television sets, in comparison to the outdoor operation of fixed devices.

Moreover, the enforcement problems described in Section IV would be particularly acute in the context of personal/portable devices. Wide diffusion of such devices is to be expected; just as today, 2.4 GHz unlicensed devices can be found in many homes, personal/portable TV band devices could proliferate throughout neighborhoods and businesses. Unlike fixed devices, which would be professionally installed, there can be no reliable means of knowing where a personal/portable device ends up once it is sold to a consumer. The inability of the Commission to effectively oversee the proliferation of personal/portable devices will create greater economic incentives for manufacturers to make products that exceed the Commission’s requirements, as occurred in the satellite radio space. Similarly, the abovementioned problems with aftermarket products designed to boost power will be even more profound.

In light of the unique and currently insurmountable challenges posed by the introduction of personal/portable devices into the broadcast spectrum, the Commission should not authorize any such devices at this time. Risking the public’s new digital television service to promote these devices would be particularly inappropriate given their lack of connection to the goal of improved broadband access, which can be achieved through careful introduction of fixed devices.

#### C. Only Exclusively Licensed TV Band Devices Should Be Allowed to Operate in the Broadcast Spectrum

MSTV and NAB appreciate the Commission’s willingness to consider the relative benefits of licensed uses of any “white spaces” that may exist. The Commission has correctly recognized that an unlicensed system is not the only possible way to authorize spectrum sharing in the television spectrum. In fact, as discussed below, a licensed white space regime would carry numerous public interest benefits—accountability, efficiency, and public remuneration—that would be lost forever by an unlicensed devices regime. Depriving the public of the benefit of new, licensed spectrum is even more inappropriate given the large swaths of unlicensed spectrum that the Commission has made available on an unlicensed basis in recent years.

First, a licensed system would address one of the biggest problems with an unlicensed system: accountability. That is, if a device operating in licensed “white space” were to interfere with the public’s access to free, over-the-air television, the licensee responsible for the spectrum used by that device could be identified and made accountable for remedying the problem. Assuming that some TV band devices will be allowed to operate within the broadcast spectrum, the only effective way to ensure that incumbent services will be protected is through a licensing system.

Second, a licensed system will also most efficiently make use of any available “white spaces” that may exist. Unlike an unlicensed regime, in which there is no mechanism to control the number of devices that operate simultaneously and the resulting “noise” from such operation, a licensed user has an incentive to decrease noise so that the noise floor of the spectrum does not rise to harmful levels and thereby prevent the licensee’s full exploitation of the “white spaces” spectrum. In contrast, in an unlicensed regime, manufacturers have an incentive to maximize their use of the spectrum without concern for the aggregate effect on the white space at issue. This incentive results in a “tragedy of the commons” whereby noise from multiple unlicensed devices transmitting in the same spectrum with inefficient technology eventually degrades the ability of all users to benefit from the spectrum. In licensed “white space,” the same entity would control the spectrum used by television services and the TV band devices and would consequently design all devices to operate using non-interfering technology.

Third, a licensed system benefits the economy and American taxpayers more effectively than an unlicensed system. With the adoption of Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, Congress made clear its intent that the Commission should auction new licenses for commercial use of the spectrum. Therefore, if TV band devices were to operate on a licensed basis, the Commission would auction licenses and receive revenues from the proceeds of the auction. In designing a system to auction new licenses for commercial use, Congress has asked the Commission to keep in mind, among others, the goals of “promoting economic opportunity” and “recovery for the public of a portion of the value of the public spectrum resource made available for commercial use and avoidance of unjust enrichment through the methods employed to award uses of that resource.”

The recent Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum, which grossed $13.9 billion, speaks to the public benefits of licensing. Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the auction of television channels 52 through 69 will raise at least $10 billion; auctioning of “white spaces” in channels 2 through 51 could produce similar results. These additional amounts would be lost, however, if the Commission chooses to allow TV band devices to operate in the broadcast spectrum on an unlicensed basis. These benefits to the economy and American taxpayers lend further support to MSTV’s position that licensing the television “white spaces” is the proper course of action.

Finally, the Commission should not allow unlicensed operation in the television band and risk interference with licensed services because the Commission has already provided adequate spectrum for the use of unlicensed devices. Within the so-called “beachfront” spectrum below 3 GHz, the Commission has already allocated over 100 MHz of spectrum to unlicensed uses. In addition, at the urging of unlicensed device manufacturers, the Commission in late 2003 expanded the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) band, which already had a 300 MHz-wide unlicensed allocation, by 255 MHz of spectrum. As a result, unlicensed devices in the U-NII spectrum have access to 555 MHz of spectrum. The Commission rightly characterized its decision to expand the U-NII band as “a significant increase in the spectrum available for unlicensed devices across the overall radio spectrum.”

Indeed, proponents of unlicensed devices appear to offer inconsistent rationales. The argument for using TV spectrum is that it has superior propagation characteristics. This would support using spectrum for unlicensed services, such as rural broadband, which can harness efficiencies of wide areas. In this regard, IEEE 802.22 has offered a fixed service approach to meet this need. However, the advantages of greater coverage are not needed for most personal and portable devices. For example, in-home wireless networking can utilize spectrum above 1 GHz to cover the short ranges typically needed for most home wireless network systems. In fact, such frequencies will be more efficient since they allow for greater frequency reuse. Thus, the justification for using the TV band—greater propagation—seems to be lacking as applied to many personal and portable devices. Consequently, other bands, which do not have the risk of interference, would appear to be more appropriate.

In light of the overabundance of underutilized unlicensed spectrum, the Commission has no cause—even if it had the authority—to allow unlicensed devices to interfere with licensed services. Sufficient spectrum is available for new unlicensed services; the Commission need not put the public’s licensed radiocommunications infrastructure at risk. The “white spaces” that exist in less densely populated areas should instead be auctioned on an exclusively licensed basis.

### Conclusion

No less than the future of the public’s television service is at stake in this proceeding. Accordingly, MSTV and NAB respectfully urge the Commission to adopt the above-described protections before authorizing any new devices in the broadcast spectrum.

**Analysis of Various Interference Mechanisms Affecting Television Reception from TV Band Devices**

**By Robert Eckert**

**Introduction**

This engineering statement has been prepared on behalf of the Association for Maximum Service Television (MSTV) as part of its comments in response to the Commission’s First Report and Order and Notice of Further Proposed Rulemaking (Docket 04-168) on Unlicensed Operation in the TV Broadcast Bands. Specifically, this statement addresses the types of interference that should be considered when developing technical rules to protect the existing licensed service from interference. The statement also provides a methodology to calculate interference and establishes minimum separation distances needed to protect TV reception from interference. The statement finds that unlicensed devices in the TV bands, particularly personal/portable devices that are uncontrolled and can be located and operated anywhere, pose a significantly greater threat of interference to TV viewers. The statement also briefly describes the difficulty of co-channel sensing within a DTV station’s contour.

**I. Types of Interference**

Interference to DTV reception can occur due to a number of different mechanisms. “TV band devices” and Part 15 unlicensed devices cannot cause interference and must protect all TV operations against a number of different types of interference. Specifically, there are four basic types of interference such devices can cause to DTV receivers. They are: (1) co-channel interference; (2) adjacent channel interference; (3) out-of-band interference; and (4) interference from taboo channels and unwanted intermodulation products. A brief description of these various interference mechanisms and how they relate to TV band or unlicensed device operation are described below:

**a. Co-channel Interference Considerations**

Co-channel interference in the context of the DTV service comes from distant undesired signals of the same 6 MHz bandwidth as that of the desired signal. In the case of TV band devices, the Commission did not explicitly state in the instant rulemaking proceeding that the TV band or unlicensed device bandwidths would match that of the DTV service. However, it appears likely that unlicensed TV band devices will tend to use channels of about the same 6 MHz width as DTV and in a corresponding sequence. It also appears that these devices will employ modulation techniques producing the same relatively flat and noise-like spectrum signature emitted by DTV transmitters. To the extent that emissions are similar, much of the testing and analysis that have generated protection requirements in the DTV service can be applied to determine requirements for low-power TV band device or unlicensed operation. In particular, after some prototype TV band devices become available and are tested, it may be found that the desired-to-undesired signal ratio adequate for co-channel DTV operation applies equally to DTV reception in the presence of co-channel signals from unlicensed or TV band devices.

**b. Adjacent Channel Interference Considerations**

Adjacent channel interference poses a special problem for the use of unlicensed devices in the TV bands. Just as in the DTV service, adjacent channel interference would come from undesired signals of equal bandwidth either immediately above or below the desired signal in frequency. In the case of operation of adjacent channels in the DTV service, the FCC established a DTV Table of Allotments that authorized adjacent channel operations at specific locations chosen to minimize interference throughout DTV stations’ service areas. Such a methodology cannot be applied to TV band device or unlicensed device operation, where the location of such devices cannot be precisely controlled. Calculations show that unlicensed transmitters or TV band devices of only 100 mW can produce a field strong enough to interfere with adjacent channel DTV receivers at 30 meters and beyond. Therefore, the only safe approach is to preclude unlicensed devices from operating in adjacent channel DTV service areas. This means the “white space” for any particular channel excludes areas of adjacent channel DTV service as well as co-channel service areas. Allowance must be made for the possibility that the device is being used at a point where the signal of an active DTV station on an adjacent channel is weak. This weak signal condition is expected near the edge of DTV service areas but may also occur well inside due to shadowing. Consequently, the proposed Part 15 rules for unlicensed rules must define an available channel as one distant from both co- and adjacent channel of a DTV station, i.e., outside the TV station’s contour by some appropriate distance.

**c. Out-of-Band Emission Interference Considerations**

Emissions adjacent to each side of the operating 6 MHz channel are not ordinary out-of-band emissions to be treated as haphazard unintentional radiation. Instead, the rules in Section 15.209 must explicitly recognize the limited (120 kHz) bandwidth of CISPR quasi-peak measurements of out-of-band emissions. Supposing that the CISPR measurement is reasonably accurate in determining the power of noise-like signals in 120 kHz, the total power in a flat noise-like signal of 6 MHz is 17 dB greater, and that is a key parameter in determining the potential for out-of-band channel interference. Measurement procedures by whatever means should obtain all the significant data that could be obtained using a spectrum analyzer.

In addition, the total power in a wide range of frequencies in the vicinity of a consumer’s TV reception system will generally increase the noise level, affecting channels beyond the first adjacency. This is particularly applicable to situations involving many unlicensed transmitters, especially in view of the envisioned popularity of the personal/portable TV band devices being proposed. By itself, this factor could wipe out DTV service on channels that might otherwise be considered unaffected. The possibilities for apparent noise power accumulation over many frequencies from many locations should be considered in revising the rules for out-of-band emissions in Section 15.209. Limits should be established so that the results of allowing unlicensed devices in the TV bands can be monitored in terms of the number and location of devices.

**d. Intermodulation Interference Considerations**

Interference potentially harmful to DTV reception can also arise due to intermodulation between various signals, weak and strong both within and outside the desired DTV channel, that may be presented to DTV receivers. Interference of this type occurs in the receiver itself and is more likely in DTV receivers sold today than in the high-quality prototype DTV receivers used to develop the DTV planning factors. For example, an image of an otherwise ignorable first-, second-, or third-adjacent DTV channel can be made to fall on the desired signal by intermodulation with narrow-band spurious emissions by unlicensed devices. While intermodulation is almost certainly present in real situations, the effects on DTV receivers have not been tested in a way that could lead to quantitative criteria for interference protection. Some new information in this regard is available from recent tests conducted by the CRC, and additional information may become available because the Commission has directed its laboratory to test contemporary DTV receivers with interfering signals from second- and third-adjacent channels and beyond. These projects offer a good opportunity for an investigation that might at least set some bounds on the degree of desensitization that can be caused by intermodulation in real situations. Such real situations involving DTV transmissions alone exist today. If it is found likely that appreciable interference is created by this mechanism, it will be necessary to design special restrictions on the use of unlicensed devices to eliminate this type of interference.

**II. White Space and Protection Ratios**

Assuming that the transmissions of unlicensed TV band devices will have a spectrum signature very much like that of DTV, many of the quantitative criteria used for the mutual protection of DTV stations can be applied to the introduction of unlicensed devices. These quantitative criteria are found in the subpart of FCC Rules governing Television Broadcast Stations. The rules in that subpart place limitations on transmitting facilities and specify the locations where specific channels are assigned or available. Similar rules of a quantitative nature must be created for unlicensed devices if they are allowed in TV bands. This entails defining boundaries of the “white space” available for use of specific channels and the technical characteristics of devices that will be allowed on such channels.

To get a clear idea of how unlicensed devices may be used, it is helpful to analyze the process of determining white space. A determination based on the protection ratios established in FCC Rules at §73.623(c) will tend to make unlicensed use conform to the protection rules already established for the DTV service itself. There are two elements to this determination: first, the service contours of individual stations, and second, the distance that must be maintained between unlicensed devices and TV receivers that may be located on the service contour.

Assuming that TV band devices are allowed to operate wherever they do not cause interference with either co-channel or adjacent channel TV service (as stated previously, operation of such TV band devices is not feasible within the co-channel or adjacent channel TV service area), the following procedure is necessary to determine whether a particular channel is available at a particular geographical point. Presumably, the determination would be made with computer assistance. A table is prepared of the separation distances between the point of interest and the service contour of every co-channel and adjacent channel DTV station. The smallest of these distances is examined, separately, for each of the adjacent channels and for the candidate unlicensed device channel. All three of these distances must, of course, be positive; that is, the point of interest must lie outside all service contours of any of the three channel types, co-channel, lower adjacent, and upper adjacent. Finally, protection ratios and power limitations imposed on unlicensed devices determine whether the device is far enough from TV receivers that may be located on these service contours. It is not enough, for example, that the candidate unlicensed device channel is assigned to serve Baltimore or Annapolis when proposing use of unlicensed operation in Washington, DC. The possibility of an error of this kind indicates the importance of establishing rigorous procedures for creating channel availability tables for unlicensed devices.

To align with the rules governing DTV service, minimum distances to service contours should be determined by reference to the D/U ratios of §73.623(c). These D/U ratios are –28 dB and –26 dB respectively for interference from lower and upper adjacent channels. In the case of the lower adjacent channel, for example, this means that interference is considered to occur at the service contour when the undesired signal is more than 28 dB stronger than 41 dBu. Note that these considerations involve a considerable degree of precision, attainable for operation of unlicensed devices at fixed locations, but requiring an extra margin of decibels in case sensing alone is relied upon by smart devices.

The criteria for co-channel operation are different in nature because any small co-channel signal power will overwhelm receivers located at the service contour. In the DTV service and interference model on which §73.623(c) is based, co-channel emissions of almost any magnitude raise the noise level sensed by receivers at the service contour to a value exceeding the minimum signal-to-noise requirement. The DTV picture will abruptly be lost at that point. Therefore, unlicensed devices operating co-channel must be completely out of range, and the out-of-range distance should be conservatively chosen to prevent interference possibilities.

**a. Required Separation Beyond Service Contours**

Consider the following situation. An unlicensed TV band device is at a geographical point determined to be outside the noise-limited service contour of a particular DTV station. The device must also be so far out of range that its co-channel emission does not increase the apparent receiver noise level. Refer to the table of distances to various field strengths, below. According to the table, to keep the free space interference field 20 dB below the desired DTV signal would require a separation of 600 miles, even though 20 dB is nowhere near enough. It is obvious that obstacles on the horizon would normally provide an effective shield, and a lesser distance will be adequate. Radio propagation models like those used to calculate contour distances could be used. However, those models involve statistical concepts such as percentage of location and time, are not well supported by data except at confidence limits near 50%, and are inappropriate in the present application where confidence approaching 100% is needed. A practical separation requirement must nevertheless be established, and it makes good sense to base this on line-of-sight considerations. The line-of-sight distance between antennas both at rooftop height is about 15 miles, and the distance from a hand-held device to a rooftop antenna is about 10 miles. Assuming that the device is 15 miles outside all co-channel DTV service contours, a further check must be made to protect adjacent channel DTV. FCC rules at §73.623(c) indicate that DTV stations are protecting one another’s service provided that adjacent channel fields are less than 67 dBu and 69 dBu respectively for interference from lower and upper adjacent channels. From the table of distances to various field strengths, it is found that this level of protection will be achieved by requiring that 4 Watt EIRP devices stay at least 3 miles from the contour of an adjacent channel TV station.

**DISTANCE TO VARIOUS FIELD STRENGTHS BY FREE SPACE PROPAGATION**

| Field Near TV Receiving Antenna | Distance from Isotropically Radiated Power of 4 Watts |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 21 dBu                           | 976,316 m (607 km / 377 miles)                       |
| 41 dBu                           | 97,632 m (60.7 km / 37.7 miles)                      |
| 67 dBu                           | 4,893 m (3.04 km / 1.89 miles)                       |
| 69 dBu                           | 3,887 m (2.42 km / 1.5 miles)                        |

**Significance of Field Strength Values:**
- 21 dBu: 20 dB below the smallest DTV signal that will provide a picture at the noise-limited contour.
- 41 dBu: Smallest DTV signal that will provide a picture at the noise-limited contour.
- 67 dBu: Maximum field from DTV transmitter on upper adjacent channel that does not cause interference.
- 69 dBu: Maximum field from DTV transmitter on lower adjacent channel that does not cause interference.

**b. Calculating Interference**

The table below describes a procedure for calculating the interfering power that would be produced by RF sources in the TV bands. The effects indicated in steps 5, 6, and 7 assume that the interference power is noise-like with an approximately flat spectrum over 6 MHz.

Note that interference fields produced by 4 W or 4000 mW sources are very great. One consequence of this is that such sources must be located well outside the service contours of both co-channel and adjacent channel DTV stations.

Also note that even though a device may be outside co- and adjacent channel contours, it will almost certainly be inside the contour of one or more DTV stations, specifically those using channels removed by 12 or more MHz. Inside DTV service contours, the directionality of TV receiving antennas will play a role in reducing interference.
