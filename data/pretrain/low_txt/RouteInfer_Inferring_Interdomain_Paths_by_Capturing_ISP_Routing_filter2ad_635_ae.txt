### Components and Their Benefits
The two key components of our algorithm, the 3-layer policy model and the route decision model, significantly enhance its overall performance. Compared to single-policy models, our 3-layer policy model increases accuracy by up to 133%. Additionally, our route decision model, which is based on learning-to-rank techniques, outperforms default policies by up to 313% in predicting route decisions. Our analysis of the inferred policies and the route decision model reveals that most Autonomous Systems (ASes) set prefix policies for Content Delivery Network (CDN) ASes. Most violations of the standard preference rule are related to peer-to-peer (p2p) links in European Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).

### Security of Internet Routing
Many studies on the security of Internet routing rely on a complete and accurate Internet routing map. However, existing works often use standard policies that perform poorly in generating such maps. Prior research [49] has shown that success in simulations does not necessarily translate to real-world success. Therefore, in future work, we will focus on analyzing the changes and impacts on these security systems after obtaining a more accurate Internet routing map.

### The Influence of Bias
The bias in BGP routing data is a common challenge in large-scale Internet measurement studies, as this data is collected from a limited number of vantage points. In this section, we investigate how the accuracy of RouteInfer varies with the distance to vantage points. We define the distance to vantage points as the minimum routing hop count. For example, if there are two paths, AS1-AS2-AS3-AS4 and AS5-AS6-AS7-AS3-AS8, with AS1 and AS5 as vantage points, AS3 is 2 hops from AS1 and 3 hops from AS5, making the distance 2 hops. We split the routing data into a training set and a test set, using the training set as input for RouteInfer and the test set to evaluate the accuracy of inferred paths. Paths in the test set are classified by their distance to vantage points. The results, shown in Fig. 18, indicate that as the distance increases, the accuracy also increases, suggesting that bias has little impact on RouteInfer's performance.

**Fig. 18.** Distance to vantage points vs. accuracy

### Convergence Time
RouteInfer simulates the process of routing decisions and announcements in the Internet. We need to wait for the simulation to converge to obtain inferred paths. In this section, we analyze the convergence time of one simulation. The results, shown in Fig. 19, indicate that the convergence time ranges from 2.62 seconds to 6.35 seconds, with an average of 4.28 seconds.

### Intuition of Choosing Routes from High-Tier ASes
In this section, we explain why we believe route decisions are influenced by the tier of the next-hop AS. We focus on Tier-1 ASes and ASes connected to Tier-1 ASes. Similar to the experiments in Section 3, we split the BGP routing data into a training set (90%) and a test set (10%). The training set is used to infer business relationships between ASes, which are then used to infer paths. The test set checks the accuracy of the predicted route decisions. For Tier-1 ASes, about 50.09% of incorrect predictions occur because the Tier-1 AS chooses a route from a Non-Tier1 AS according to standard policies, rather than another Tier-1 AS. For ASes connected to Tier-1 ASes, about 58.04% of incorrect predictions occur for the same reason. These findings suggest that many Tier-1 ASes prefer routes from other Tier-1 ASes, and ASes connected to Tier-1 ASes may also prefer routes from Tier-1 ASes.
