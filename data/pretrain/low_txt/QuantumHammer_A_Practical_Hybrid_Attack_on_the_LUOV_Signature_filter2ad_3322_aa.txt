## Abstract

Post-quantum cryptographic schemes are expected to replace existing public-key schemes in billions of devices within a decade. To facilitate this transition, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) is conducting a standardization process. Multivariate signatures are one of the main categories in NIST's post-quantum cryptography competition. Among the four candidates in this category, the LUOV and Rainbow schemes are based on the Oil and Vinegar scheme, first introduced in 1997, which has withstood over two decades of cryptanalysis. Beyond mathematical security and efficiency, resistance against side-channel attacks is a major concern in the competition. The current sentiment is that post-quantum schemes may be more resistant to fault-injection attacks due to their large key sizes and lack of algebraic structure. We show that this is not true.

We introduce a novel hybrid attack, QuantumHammer, and demonstrate it on the constant-time implementation of LUOV currently in Round 2 of the NIST post-quantum competition. The QuantumHammer attack combines a bit-tracing attack enabled via Rowhammer fault injection and a divide-and-conquer attack that uses bit-tracing as an oracle. Using bit-tracing, an attacker with access to faulty signatures collected using Rowhammer can recover secret key bits, albeit slowly. We employ a divide-and-conquer attack that exploits the structure in the key generation part of LUOV and solves the system of equations for the secret key more efficiently with a few key bits recovered via bit-tracing.

We have demonstrated the first successful in-the-wild attack on LUOV, recovering all 11,229 key bits with less than 4 hours of active Rowhammer attack. The post-processing part is highly parallel and can be trivially sped up using modest resources. QuantumHammer does not make any unrealistic assumptions, only requires software co-location (no physical access), and therefore can be used to target shared cloud servers or in other sandboxed environments.

## 1 Introduction

The emergence of quantum computers will render traditional public-key schemes such as RSA and ECC insecure. Shor's algorithm [41] will be able to break the underlying hard factorization and discrete log problems. Quantum computers will also affect symmetric-key cryptosystems, but their impact can be mitigated by mildly increasing key sizes. For instance, using Grover's search algorithm [20], one may brute force a 128-bit secure system in 2^64 iterations. In general, Grover's algorithm reduces the complexity of symmetric-key schemes from O(N) to O(√N), where log2(N) is the security level in bits. Hence, doubling the key size may be a solution to retain the security level.

The US NIST has recently started a competition for quantum-secure public-key cryptosystems for digital signatures, Public-Key Encryption (PKE), and Key-Establishment Mechanisms (KEMs) [33]. In the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Standardization process [1], 26 schemes passed the first round and are currently competing in the second round, of which 9 are digital signature schemes. The evaluation criteria consist of three major components: security, cost, and performance, along with algorithm and implementation characteristics.

Based on the underlying hard problems, the submissions are divided into five broad categories: lattice-based, code-based, hash-based, isogeny-based, and multivariate schemes. These categories have different characteristics with varying key sizes and performances. Multivariate schemes are known to be very efficient for resource-constrained devices but have large key sizes. Under this category, there are four signature schemes: GeMSS, LUOV, MQDSS, and Rainbow. MQDSS is based on the Fiat-Shamir construction, and GeMSS is a faster variant of QUARTZ. Lifted Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar (LUOV) is an improvement of the Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar (UOV) scheme with smaller public keys. Rainbow is an extension of UOV with an additional oil layer.

A number of side-channel attacks have been performed on PQC schemes. Bruinderink et al. [8] performed the first side-channel attack on lattice-based signature schemes in 2016, specifically a flush and reload attack on BLISS. The attack was extended to BLISS-B by Pessl et al. [36]. Both of these attacks targeted the Bernoulli and CDT sampling. An extension to this work was presented by Bootle et al. [6], which managed to recover 100% of the secret key compared to only 7% in the previous work [17]. Another side-channel attack by Ravi et al. [37] achieved existential forgery, targeting Dilithium, a lattice-based signature scheme.

A more recent timing attack focused on the error-correcting codes used in lattice-based schemes by D'Anvers et al. [12] in 2019. Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) attack has also been shown to be effective by Park et al. [34] on Rainbow and UOV. The early timing attacks motivated efforts to design constant-time discrete Gaussian samplers, i.e., [25, 26, 49]. Many of the NIST submissions, including LUOV, provided constant-time implementations to eliminate any passive side-channel attacks. The NIST Round 2 version of LUOV, specifically added a random salt for every message and required randomly generated vinegars to defend against side-channel and fault injection attacks.

A more recent noteworthy work by Ding et al. [13, 15] presented a (purely) algebraic attack, i.e., the subfield differential attack. Without any side-channel information, the attack managed to significantly reduce the security level of LUOV. Specifically, for LUOV-8-58-237, the complexity is reduced from 2^146 to 2^105, which is lower than the minimum security level criteria established by NIST for the post-quantum competition. The updated version of LUOV now uses finite fields GF(2^r), where r is a prime, rendering the subfield differential attack inapplicable [44].

There is some research aimed at evaluating the resilience of post-quantum schemes against fault attacks. Genet et al. [19] have demonstrated a fault attack on a hash-based digital signature scheme SPHINCS. Another differential fault attack was introduced by Bruinderink et al. [9] on deterministic lattice signatures. Espitau et al. [16] have presented fault attacks on lattice-based signature schemes BLISS, GLP, PASSSign, and Ring-TESLA. Blindel et al. [4] have also applied fault attacks on lattice-based signature schemes, namely BLISS, ring-TESLA, and GLP. Ravi et al. [38] have presented fault attacks on lattice-based schemes NewHope, Kyber, Frodo, and Dilithium. This research is based on hardware faults like electromagnetic fault injections and clock glitches. Post-quantum schemes are more difficult to attack via side-channel or fault attacks due to their massive keys and lack of algebraic structure. Collecting KBytes through slow bit-flips or leakages observed by the attacker over extended durations is impractical since it is highly unlikely for a victim to be present and continuously running the target cryptographic primitive. Therefore, small side-channel leakages and fewer faults may not entirely break the scheme. On the other hand, these schemes are based on strong post-quantum (conjectured) hard problems that have withstood years of cryptanalysis. Here we opt for a different attack strategy, i.e., we analyze LUOV using a combination of fault injections while simultaneously targeting the algebraic structure. Hence, we follow a hybrid attack strategy.

### 1.1 Our Contribution

We have discovered a practical technique that recovers all secret key bits in LUOV. QuantumHammer proceeds by injecting faults, collecting faulty signatures, followed by a divide-and-conquer attack. The faults are achieved using a realistic software-only approach via a Rowhammer attack. In summary, in this work:

1. **Bit-Tracing Technique:** We introduce a simple technique that uses faulty signatures to mathematically trace and recover key bits. Each faulty signature yields a key bit. While not efficient, the technique gives us a tool that we then amplify the efficiency of our attack using an analytical approach.
   
2. **Analytical Attack:** The analytical attack exploits structures in the generation of the public key using a small number of recovered key bits (using a modest number of fault injections). The complexity of attacking the overall multivariate system is reduced to a number of much smaller MV problems, which are tractable with modest resources using brute force.
   
3. **Software-Only Attack:** Our attack is software-only, i.e., we do not assume any physical access to the device. This also permits remote attacks on shared cloud servers or in browsers. We assume that the memory module is susceptible to Rowhammer and that faulty signatures can be recovered.
   
4. **End-to-End Rowhammer Attack:** Earlier fault attacks on post-quantum schemes assumed hypothetical faults. We present a successful end-to-end Rowhammer attack on a constant-time AVX2-optimized implementation of the multivariate post-quantum signature scheme LUOV.
   
5. **Full Key Recovery:** We have demonstrated full key recovery of 11,229 bits for LUOV-7-57-197 in less than 4 hours of online Rowhammer attack and 49 hours of offline post-processing.
   
6. **Applicability:** This attack is applicable to all variants of the LUOV Scheme currently competing in Round 2 of NIST’s competition, including the updates [44] after Ding et al. attack [15].

### 1.3 Related Work

On Rainbow-like schemes, Ding et al. [14] introduced an algebraic Reconciliation attack as an early work in 2008. Afterwards, as for fault attacks on multivariate schemes, only a few results exist: In 2011, Hashimoto et al. [23] worked on Big Field type and Stepwise Triangular System (STS) including UOV and Rainbow. In 2019, Kramer et al. [30] also worked on UOV and Rainbow, extending the earlier work. We will only discuss UOV and Rainbow in this section and not the Big Field type schemes. Reconciliation is an algebraic attack, whereas the other two works assume physical fault attacks, first introduced by Boneh et al. [5] but with no details on fault injection techniques. Kramer et al. claimed that randomness of vinegar variables and the layers in Rainbow provide good protection against fault attacks. These studies consider the following attack scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Algebraic Attack
In this scenario [14], a purely algebraic attack improves on brute force without assuming any physical fault or side-channel information. The aim is to invert the public map P by finding a sequence of change of basis matrices. P is decomposed into a series of linear transformations, which are recovered step by step, significantly reducing the security level.

#### Scenario 2: Central Map
This scenario assumes that a coefficient of the secret quadratic central map F has been faulted. By signing randomly chosen messages with the faulty F' and verifying the signatures with the correct public key P, partial information about the secret linear transformation matrix S can be recovered using δ = S ◦ (F' − F) ◦ T, where T is another secret linear transformation matrix. As (F' − F) is sparse, S can be partially recovered. At least m - 1 faults are required to recover some part of the secret key matrix S, where m is the number of equations in the system. Both [23] and [30] assume that the attack can induce faults in either S, F, or T and provide the success probabilities of hitting the central map F. Kramer et al. [30] refute a claim made earlier by Hashimoto et al. [23] and claim that UOV is immune to the fault attack on the central map because the attack is recovering part of S and not T, which is not present in the UOV scheme.

#### Scenario 3: Fixed Vinegar
This scenario assumes that the attacker can fix part of randomly chosen vinegar variables from (x_v-u+1, ..., x_v), where u is the number of vinegar variables fixed out of total v vinegar variables during multiple signature computation sessions. After that, message/signature pairs are generated and utilized to recover the secrets. n - u + 1 pairs are needed to recover part of T. As the attack recovers partial information about T, it is applicable to both the UOV and Rainbow schemes but still not sufficient to recover the secret key.

Shim et al. [40] have recently presented an algebraic fault analysis attack on the UOV and Rainbow schemes. They assume a similar scenario of fixed (reused) vinegar but also include two more scenarios: revealed and set to zero vinegar.
