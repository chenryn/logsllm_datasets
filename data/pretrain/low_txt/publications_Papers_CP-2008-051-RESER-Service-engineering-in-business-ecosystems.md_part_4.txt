### Concepts and Methodologies of Recent Years

Recent years have demonstrated that theoretical foundations without tool support often fail to gain widespread acceptance. This is due to two primary reasons:

1. **User Accessibility**: Tool support reduces the entry barrier for users by providing guidance and assistance. In cases involving highly complex problems, such tools are essential as they help users manage intricate information and structures.
2. **Validation and Feasibility**: Tool support serves as an initial validation of concepts and methodologies by proving their feasibility and identifying potential issues.

### Implementation of the ISE-Framework in the ISE-Workbench

Given these considerations, we decided to implement the ISE-Framework within the ISE-Workbench. The model-driven approach of ISE necessitates a set of model-based tools corresponding to each ISE-layer. These tools are based on a common formalism, enabling automatic model transformations via a model transformation engine. Additionally, features like integrated validation, common persistency, and model federation can be applied. The workbench is built on the Eclipse platform, with the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) serving as the foundation for model definition and collaborative modeling, aligning with the requirements of service engineering in business ecosystems.

### Tool Selection and Integration

Using the constraints of Eclipse and EMF, we selected several existing tools, including:
- A graphical BPEL-Toolset
- A graphical BPMN-Editor
- Graphical UML-Tools

The ISE-Workbench will also provide an entry point to the ISE-Framework by visualizing the model selection and path through the ISE-layers. It guides users through the development process, visualizes model dependencies, and offers automatic support for managing model dependencies using model transformation. This work is based on a standard language for model transformation rule specification, such as Query, View, and Transformation (QVT), provided by the Object Management Group (OMG).

### Benefits of the ISE Methodology

As the concept of e-services is still in its early stages, there are no established methodologies specifically tailored for e-service engineering. Consequently, pioneers in this field often develop e-services in a manual, ad hoc, and error-prone manner, leading to disorganized, delayed, and over-budget projects. The ISE framework addresses these challenges by providing key design practices and artifacts for e-service planning. The benefits of the ISE methodology include:

- **Active Engagement**: All stakeholders, such as business strategists, business architects, IT analysts, and IT developers, actively participate in the e-service development to ensure that business objectives are met. ISE supports these stakeholders by offering specific perspectives on e-service development.
- **Model-Based Approach**: The ISE framework uses a set of models to describe or specify e-services' structure, functionality, and behavior. Each model is assigned to specific stakeholders and dimensions, allowing for the visualization and synchronization of dependencies. Changes in one model trigger updates in related models.
- **Compliance with Regulations**: ISE's reliance on formal models ensures that e-services comply with relevant laws, policies, and regulations. For instance, ISE provides information on billing, payment, security, and confidentiality, facilitating easy checks on financial and security policies.
- **Technology Standardization**: E-services must conform to existing standards to ensure compatibility with data, applications, services, communications, integration, and security. The models created within ISE and the main output of ISE are sets of technical standards, making the formal models independent of specific technological choices and platforms.
- **Clear Semantics**: ISE employs two constructs to provide clear semantics for e-services: models and a business ontology. The set of models offers strong semantics due to their high level of familiarity and standardization. The business ontology allows for the construction of a common vocabulary of concepts, shared across perspectives and dimensions, and accessible to all models.

### Conclusion and Future Activities

The ISE methodology involves various stakeholders, including business developers, business analysts, IT analysts, and IT developers. Business developers typically work with semi-formal information on strategic issues, while IT developers focus on formal models for implementation. The ISE methodology is characterized by three main features:
1. **Support for Different Perspectives**: The new methodology supports different perspectives according to the varying needs of stakeholders.
2. **Formal Models for Methodical Approach**: Formal models are assigned to each perspective to ensure a methodical approach to e-service development.
3. **Consistency Across Perspectives**: Consistency in e-service development is achieved by transforming the content of a model from one perspective to another and vice versa.

To further improve the ISE methodology, the underlying model-driven framework needs to be evaluated in different contexts, such as:
- Entrepreneurs vs. large organizations
- Simple vs. complex (networked) e-services
- Heterarchical vs. hierarchical networked partner organizations

Future evaluations may lead to the extension of the ISE methodology to include innovation and runtime phases, supporting the full e-service lifecycle.
