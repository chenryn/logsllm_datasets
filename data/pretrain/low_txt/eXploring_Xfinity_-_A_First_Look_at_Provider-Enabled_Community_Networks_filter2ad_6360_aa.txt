## Abstract
Several broadband providers have been offering community WiFi as an additional service for existing customers and paid subscribers. These community networks provide Internet connectivity on the go for mobile devices and a way to offload cellular traffic. Instead of deploying new infrastructure or relying on organized community resources, these provider-enabled community WiFi services leverage the existing hardware and connections of their customers. Over the past few years, there has been significant growth in their popularity and coverage, with some municipalities and institutions considering them as the basis for public Internet access.

In this paper, we present the first characterization of one such service—the Xfinity Community WiFi network. We examine the performance and availability of this service from the perspectives of both the home-router owner and the public hotspot user in urban and suburban settings between September 2014 and 2015. Our results highlight the challenges of providing these services in urban environments, considering the tensions between coverage and interference, large obstructions, and high population densities. Through controlled experiments, we measure the impact on hosting customers, finding that in certain cases, the use of the public hotspot can degrade host network throughput by up to 67% under high traffic on the public hotspot.

## 1. Introduction
The rapid growth in the number of mobile devices and our increasing dependence on them and the services they support have created a high demand for Internet connectivity on the go. Several large network providers, including Comcast, Time Warner, British Telecom (UK), and Orange (France), have started addressing this demand by deploying millions of WiFi hotspots around the globe, either as a free service to existing customers or as an additional source of revenue.

Instead of deploying new infrastructure or relying on the resources of an organized community, these provider-enabled community WiFi services leverage the existing hardware and connections of their customers for coverage. In these networks, residential and commercial customers' access points broadcast an additional public hotspot SSID to bootstrap coverage of the community WiFi network. Despite their rapid growth and extensive media coverage, there is a lack of understanding of the effective value of these community network services for consumers and the impact, if any, of their use on the residential customers they rely upon.

In this paper, we present the first characterization of a provider-enabled community WiFi network, focusing on the Xfinity Community WiFi. Xfinity WiFi is the largest such network available in the U.S., with over 10 million devices as of July 2015. From the perspectives of both the home router owner and the public hotspot user, we characterize the coverage, availability, and performance of this service under various geographic and temporal contexts, over three weeks in 2014 and six weeks in 2015. We performed controlled experiments to measure the impact of concurrent access to both the home network and the public Xfinity WiFi hotspot. Our results highlight the challenges of providing these community WiFi services in urban and suburban settings, considering the tensions between coverage and interference in high population densities.

### Key Findings
1. **Growth in Xfinity WiFi Network:** We found significant growth in the Xfinity WiFi network in all measured areas during our study period. Much of this growth was in the number of access points starting to broadcast in the 5 GHz band, particularly in our urban environment, where 45% of access points use 5 GHz (compared to only 15% in the suburban setting).
2. **Challenges in Connectivity:** Despite the higher number of Xfinity WiFi access points, connecting to these access points for Internet connectivity was challenging. After examining signal strength and interference in each environment, we found much lower signal strength and higher interference levels in the urban setting compared to the suburban one, which partially explains the observed differences in connectivity and performance.
3. **Performance Degradation:** We found significant performance degradation of the hosting customer’s home network, with throughput reaching half of the maximum attainable throughput for 4 Mbps traffic on the public WiFi. This appears to be caused not by the additional traffic on the link, but rather by the competition with the hosted public WiFi hotspot network for the same radio device and spectrum.

## 2. Community WiFi Networks
There has been growing interest in providing public WiFi access from the private sector, civil organizations, and end users. For example, the Electronic Frontier Foundation is one of many sponsors of the Open Wireless Movement, aimed at creating a network of volunteer-supported free and open wireless Internet. Several router manufacturers are equipping routers with additional "Guest" WiFi access points, allowing public access while isolating public from home traffic. FON offers access to a virtually global WiFi network of "foneros" that support guest users in exchange for free roaming and/or revenue from paid users.

Several municipalities around the world, sometimes in cooperation with the private sector, have also begun providing free or fee-based access to city-wide wireless networks. Chicago, for instance, is developing the Chicago Tech Plan to build a model for cities and technology for smart communities. Other examples include early efforts such as the MIT RoofNet and MadMesh, and Google's public WiFi in Palo Alto, CA.

Recently, Internet service providers such as AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner, British Telecom (UK), and Orange (France) have also started to offer public WiFi hotspots for their existing customers. For example, AT&T provides both existing cellular and broadband customers with access to a nationwide network of WiFi hotspots, labeled `attwifi`, located at AT&T retail locations and partnered businesses.

### 2.1 Xfinity WiFi - A Provider-Enabled Community WiFi
On June 10th, 2013, Comcast announced its plans to create millions of WiFi APs available to its customers through a neighborhood hotspot initiative. The company started enabling a second `xfinitywifi` SSID broadcast in their existing customer gateways to act as a publicly accessible hotspot. The uniqueness of this model comes from its customer-supported-and-provider-enabled approach, which allowed Comcast to bootstrap hotspot coverage by leveraging the provided routers of existing commercial and residential customers.

Since then, the service has grown to include over 10 million public hotspots in the U.S. All Comcast users with XFINITY Internet Performance tier and above can connect to these hotspots for free, while non-Comcast customers can purchase an XFINITY WiFi Access Pass with different hourly, daily, and weekly durations.

## 3. Characterization of Xfinity WiFi Network
To understand the challenges of providing community WiFi services in urban environments, we conducted a series of experiments in Chicago's central business district (The Loop) and in Evanston, one of its northern suburbs. We designed our experiments to capture the experience of public users, taking measurements from public areas surrounding Xfinity WiFi access points. In the following paragraphs, we use results from a series of such experiments conducted over the course of a year to discuss (i) the coverage of Xfinity WiFi, (ii) its availability as a usable Internet connection, and (iii) its performance to users. Motivated by the poor connectivity and performance we observed in urban Chicago, we investigate possible causes, including radio interference and signal strengths of deployed access points.

### 3.1 Data and Methodology
We measured the coverage, availability, and performance of Xfinity WiFi using an instrumented Samsung Galaxy S4 to continuously scan for available APs, recording their signal strength, BSSIDs, and channel, along with the device’s current GPS location. When an available `xfinitywifi` SSID was found, the tool attempted to connect to the one with the strongest received signal strength (RSSI). Upon successful association and authentication, it conducted network performance measurements using the Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT).

We conducted our experiments in two geographic areas: one in the high-density urban environment of Chicago, IL, and one in a mix of residential and low-density commercial areas in Evanston, IL. Each area covers a similar surface—4×4 block area (0.13 sq. mi) in Evanston and 6×4 block area (0.15 sq. mi) in Chicago. We took our measurements at three separate times between 2014 and 2015: in September 2014, April 2015, and September 2015. In each instance, we canvassed each area, walking the same path in 2-hour intervals both in the morning and evenings to capture peak and non-peak hours. Unless otherwise specified, the results presented for availability and network performance come from the September 2015 dataset.

### 3.2 Deployment and Coverage
We measured the growth in deployed Xfinity WiFi access points in both locations between September 2014 and September 2015, noticing a significant growth in both areas in the number of observed access points. While Evanston gained more overall access points, Chicago saw a much larger relative increase. Between September 2014 and 2015, the number of Xfinity WiFi hotspots in urban Chicago increased more than 7 times (from 22 to 164), while the number of hotspots in suburban Evanston nearly doubled (from 181 to 342). Despite the large growth, we still observed twice as many access points in Evanston than in Chicago in our final measurement.

Aside from the overall growth in the number of access points, we observed a higher proportion of new 5 GHz band deployments over the year. Similar to the results from total access points, we observed a much higher growth rate of 5 GHz hotspots in Chicago (around 45%) compared with suburban Evanston (15%). Deploying hotspots using the 5 GHz radio band in urban environments may be driven by the assumption of lower radio interference.

Geographic coverage was determined by dividing each measured area into a grid of cells—each cell an area of 0.001 degree latitude by 0.001 degree longitude—and searching for the presence of Xfinity WiFi access points in each. In September 2015, we found access points in over 70% of areas in downtown Chicago and over 90% of areas in Evanston.

### 3.3 Availability
The utility of community WiFi networks depends not only on the presence of an access point but also on the ability of clients to successfully connect to them. There are many reasons why a client could see the service SSID but be unable to connect, such as low signal strength. In this section, we discuss results from our measurements of service availability, defined as the percentage of Xfinity WiFi access points that one can successfully connect to during an experiment.

Overall, despite the extensive coverage and high density of the Xfinity WiFi hotspot network, we found the service to be typically unavailable, with our measurement device unable to connect to the majority of access points—56% in Evanston and 87% in downtown Chicago. Table 1 summarizes these findings, organized by measurement location and radio band.

| Location | 5 GHz | 2.4 GHz | All |
|----------|-------|---------|-----|
| Chicago (urban) | 3840 (71) | 442 (56) | 4282 (127) |
| Evanston (suburban) | 49 (39) | 2316 (286) | 2365 (325) |

We find that Xfinity WiFi in Evanston displayed much higher availability compared to downtown Chicago. Of 124 APs we attempted to connect with in Chicago, we were only able to connect with 10 (13%) 2.4 GHz and 8 (16%) 5 GHz hotspots. In Evanston, we successfully connected to a significantly higher fraction of access points—66 (44%) 2.4 GHz and 13 (33%) 5 GHz networks.

There can be many external factors that explain the poor connectivity in urban areas. We investigated how signal properties of these access points affected our availability results, looking at the RSSI of devices we issued connect requests to. Figures 2a and 2b display the distribution of maximum signal strengths observed for the set of Xfinity WiFi access points found in each radio band.

We noted a higher presence of Xfinity WiFi hotspots with strong signal strength (broadcast RSSI) in suburban Evanston than in urban Chicago, which partially helps explain the higher service availability observed in Evanston. The impact of low signal strength on availability is clearly illustrated in Figure 2c, which shows the number of successful connections compared to the total attempts for 5 GHz access points in Chicago at different signal strengths. The steep drop-off of successful attempts with decreasing signal strength—including the 4% success rate of 5 GHz APs with RSSI less than 80—explains much of the low availability seen in this setting.

### Investigating Wireless Properties
After observing the low availability of Xfinity WiFi access points in urban Chicago, we further investigated whether other factors, such as interference, contributed to the poor performance.
