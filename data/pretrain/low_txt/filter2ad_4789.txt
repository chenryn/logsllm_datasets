### Message from the PDS Program Chair

**Peter Kemper**

Welcome to the 2013 Performance and Dependability Symposium (PDS) in Budapest!

The PDS is a highly respected international forum for researchers and practitioners to present innovative, high-quality results in the analysis and assessment of computer systems and networks. These assessments focus on performance, dependability, and security. The scope of the symposium encompasses a wide range of systems, from small embedded devices and hardware components to large-scale networked systems and infrastructures. The properties of interest include various aspects of performance, dependability, and security, with assessment methods ranging from empirical and experimental studies to sophisticated mathematical modeling.

This year, we received 113 submissions from 20 countries, including 95 regular papers, 11 practical experience reports, and 7 tool descriptions. These submissions covered a broad spectrum of research and practical applications in the field.

The review and selection process adhered to the rigorous standards set by the DSN (Dependable Systems and Networks). Every effort was made to ensure that submissions were evaluated solely based on their scientific merit. A double-blind review process was employed, ensuring that reviewers did not know the authors or their affiliations throughout the selection process. Each paper received three to five reviews in two rounds. The first round, consisting of three reviews, served as a preselection phase. Authors had the opportunity to provide feedback and address questions raised by the reviewers before the PC (Program Committee) meeting. Discussions among reviewers took place online to resolve any open issues. The authors' rebuttals and the reviews were thoroughly discussed through the START conference management system and during the PC meeting at the University of Maryland on February 18-19, which was attended by 32 PC members.

The selection process was highly competitive, with only 25 papers accepted: 22 regular papers, 2 practical experience reports, and 1 tool description. The overall acceptance rate was 22%.

I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all the authors who submitted their work to PDS. I believe that the reviewing process provided valuable feedback to all, regardless of the final decision. I also express my deep gratitude to the 40 PC members who dedicated their time and expertise to ensure the quality of the reviewing and selection process. I am equally grateful to the external reviewers for their outstanding assistance. The PC members and reviewers provide an invaluable service to our community, making PDS the premier venue for presenting solid and strong results in our field.

I would also like to thank the DSN General Chair (András Pataricza), the DSN Steering Committee Chairs and Vice-Chairs (Neeraj Suri and Rick Schlichting in 2012, Roberto Baldoni and Paulo Verissimo in 2013) for their support. The cooperation with the DCCS Program Chair (George Candea) was both stimulating and effective. Special thanks go to Michel Cukier for sharing his experiences as the PDS PC Chair in 2012 and for his kind support in hosting the PC meeting at the University of Maryland. Several SC and many PC members provided valuable feedback and guidance, particularly Peter Buchholz, Susanna Donatelli, Mohamed Kaâniche, and Bill Sanders, whom I gratefully acknowledge here.

Thank you for attending this year's DSN. I hope you find the program intellectually stimulating and that you have reserved some extra time to enjoy the historical and cultural highlights of Budapest.
