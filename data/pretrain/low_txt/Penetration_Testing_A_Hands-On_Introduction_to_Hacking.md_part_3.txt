### Company’s Core Business Activities, Mission, Vision, and Legal Requirements

Identifying all critical business processes, data, and data flows within a company is a foundational step in risk management. This process involves compiling a detailed inventory of all IT systems (including equipment, networks, applications, interfaces, etc.) that support the company’s critical business processes and data from an IT perspective. This task is time-consuming and can be challenging, as it is easy to overlook certain systems that, while not directly supporting critical processes, are nonetheless essential because other systems depend on them. This inventory is fundamentally important and serves as an excellent starting point for a risk assessment exercise.

### Information Security Program Goals

One of the primary goals of an information security program is to define what is necessary to preserve the desired levels of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a company’s IT systems and data. Business process owners should clearly define their objectives, and the role of information security professionals is to implement and test measures to ensure these goals are met.

### Determining Actual Risk

There are several methods to determine the actual risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a company’s systems. One effective approach is to conduct a technical assessment to evaluate how easily an adversary could compromise the desired security levels. This includes assessing the potential for undermining confidentiality, breaking system integrity, and interfering with system availability, either through direct attacks or by targeting users with access to these systems.

### The Role of Penetration Testing

This is where a penetration tester (pentester, ethical hacker, or similar) becomes crucial. A skilled pentester combines knowledge of system design, construction, and maintenance with the ability to find creative ways around defenses. They play a vital role in identifying and demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of a company’s information security posture.

### Who This Book Is For

If you are interested in becoming a penetration tester or if you are a systems/network administrator looking to enhance your understanding of system security, this book is tailored for you. It covers the more technical aspects of penetration testing, starting with the initial information-gathering process. You will learn how to exploit vulnerable networks and applications, delve deeper into the network, and assess the potential damage that could be inflicted.

### Unique Features of This Book

This book stands out because it is not just a compilation of tools and options. It takes a practical, hands-on approach, designed around a lab environment with virtual machines and vulnerable applications. This allows you to safely practice various pentesting techniques using publicly available free tools.

### Structure and Content

Each chapter begins with an introduction and includes one or more hands-on exercises. These exercises will help you understand how vulnerabilities can be discovered and exploited. You will also find helpful tips and tricks from experienced professional pentesters, real-life scenarios, proven techniques, and anecdotes from actual penetration tests.

### What You Will Learn

- **Using Metasploit Framework**: Exploit vulnerable applications and use a single hole in a system’s defenses to bypass perimeter protections, dive deeper into the network, and exfiltrate data.
- **Bypassing Antivirus Programs**: Perform efficient social engineering attacks using tools like the Social-Engineer Toolkit.
- **Wi-Fi Network Security**: Understand how to break into a corporate Wi-Fi network and assess the risks associated with bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies.
- **Exploit Development**: Learn the basics of writing your own exploits, including finding vulnerabilities, exploiting them with common techniques, and even writing your own Metasploit module.
- **Mobile Hacking**: Assess the security of mobile devices using the Smartphone Pentest Framework.

- **Chapter 1**: Setting up a small practice laboratory.
- **Chapter 2**: Basics of using Kali Linux and Linux operating systems.
- **Chapter 3**: Basics of programming.
- **Chapter 4**: Introduction to the Metasploit Framework.

### Part II: Assessments

- **Chapter 5**: Gathering data about the target.
- **Chapter 6**: Searching for vulnerabilities.
- **Chapter 7**: Capturing sensitive traffic.

### Part III: Attacks

- **Chapter 8**: Exploiting network vulnerabilities.
- **Chapter 9**: Attacking password management.
- **Chapter 10**: Leveraging client-side attacks.
- **Chapter 11**: Combining client-side attacks with social engineering.
- **Chapter 12**: Bypassing antivirus software.

### Part IV: Post-Exploitation

- **Chapter 13**: Post-exploitation techniques.
- **Chapter 14**: Assessing the security of custom web applications.
- **Chapter 15**: Assessing the security of wireless networks.

### Part V: Exploit Development

- **Chapters 16-19**: Writing your own exploits, including finding vulnerabilities, exploiting them, and writing Metasploit modules.

### Part VI: Mobile Hacking

- **Chapter 20**: Assessing the security of mobile devices using the Smartphone Pentest Framework.

### Conclusion

This book does not cover every aspect of information security, but it provides a solid foundation and hands-on experience to get you started. It is an honor to be part of your journey into the exciting and rapidly developing field of information security. I hope this book inspires you to continue your studies and become an active member of the community.
