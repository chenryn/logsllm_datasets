I believe that Bootstrap should incorporate icons into alert messages (such as errors, warnings, and informational messages) by default. The inclusion of icons in these alerts would significantly enhance web accessibility, aligning with the WCAG 2.0 guidelines. Icons can be particularly beneficial for colorblind users, as they provide an additional visual cue to help interpret the message.

Recently, Drupal addressed a similar issue, and you can find their discussion here: [Drupal Issue #874370](http://drupal.org/node/874370).

I understand that this suggestion may overlap with issue #54, but I propose revisiting it, especially since icons are now available in version 2.0. However, upon reviewing the current icon set, I did not find any that seem suitable for alert messages. Perhaps we could explore alternative solutions to address this need.

I am eager to hear your thoughts on this matter.
