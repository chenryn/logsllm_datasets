### Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards

#### Overview
The three elements—Governance, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and Usage—each have their own measures. The results of these measures are displayed using Harvey Ball representations, as illustrated to the right. Since each urban/metropolitan area has already developed and exercised a Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP), the minimum score is set at a quarter of a Harvey Ball, representing "Early Implementation," rather than an empty Harvey Ball.

#### Summary Definitions of Interoperable Communications Maturity Levels
The following definitions provide an understanding of what each urban/metropolitan area generally demonstrated in achieving a given maturity level:

- **Advanced Implementation**
  - **Usage:** First responders regularly and seamlessly utilize interoperability solutions. The region demonstrated successful multi-agency communications during exercises, including state, federal, and support organizations.
  - **SOPs:** Regional SOPs, reviewed through the TICP process, are in place and regularly used by included agencies. NIMS procedures are well established among all agencies and disciplines. All procedures were effectively utilized during exercises.
  - **Governance:** Decision-making bodies proactively look to expand membership to ensure representation from broader public support disciplines and other levels of government, while updating their agreements and strategic plans on a regular basis.

- **Established Implementation**
  - **Usage:** First responders use interoperability solutions regularly and easily. The region demonstrated successful multi-agency communications during exercises, which may have included state, federal, and support organizations.
  - **SOPs:** Existing regional SOPs were reviewed and included in the TICP and are in use by included agencies. NIMS-compliant command and control has been instituted by all agencies and disciplines in the region. Despite minor issues, all SOPs were successfully demonstrated during exercises.
  - **Governance:** Formal agreements outline the roles and responsibilities of a decision-making group, which has an agreed-upon strategic plan that addresses sustainable funding for collective, regional interoperable communications needs.

- **Intermediate Implementation**
  - **Usage:** First responders use interoperability solutions regularly and demonstrated the ability to achieve multi-agency communications despite some challenges during exercises.
  - **SOPs:** Some existing SOPs were incorporated in the TICP, and steps have been taken to institute these interoperability procedures among included agencies. Formal NIMS/ICS procedures are in place, but understanding varies among agencies leading to some issues during exercises.
  - **Governance:** Some formal agreements exist, and informal agreements are in practice among members of a decision-making group. Regional strategic and budget planning processes are beginning to be put in place.

- **Early Implementation**
  - **Usage:** Interoperable communications solutions are rarely used for multi-agency communication, and difficulties were encountered in achieving interoperability during exercises.
  - **SOPs:** Region-wide SOPs were developed and formalized for the first time through the TICP but have not been disseminated to all included agencies. Some elements of NIMS/ICS procedures for command and control are in place, but understanding varies among agencies and was an area of difficulty during exercises.
  - **Governance:** Decision-making groups are informal and do not yet have a strategic plan in place to guide collective communications interoperability goals and funding.

#### Progress to Date with Tactical Interoperable Communications
Since its establishment in 2002, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been working to improve interoperable communications. From FY 2003 through FY 2006, more than $2.9 billion in grant assistance was provided to state and local agencies for equipment and projects to enhance communications interoperability. Programs such as the Interoperable Communications Technical Assistance Program (ICTAP) and SAFECOM have developed tools and expedited technology standards development, testing, and evaluation to assist public safety agencies in planning and implementing communications systems.

However, as DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff noted in his May 8, 2006, speech to the Tactical Interoperable Communications Planning Conference, public safety still has immediate communications interoperability requirements that need to be identified and rapidly met. Barriers to interoperable communications are both technical and operational, requiring agencies to examine governance, procedures, training, exercises, and usage in addition to addressing technology and disparate communications systems.

Beginning with the FY 2005 grant cycle, the Grant Programs Directorate (G&T) began providing urban/metropolitan areas with operational planning and exercise support within the framework of multijurisdictional, multidiscipline incident response. The scorecard marks the culmination of two years of planning and exercising tactical interoperable communications capabilities.

#### Key Achievements
Through the development of the TICP, validation exercises, and scorecard development, all 75 urban/metropolitan areas have achieved the following:
- **Regional Communications Committee (TICP Requirement)**
- **Regional Equipment Inventory (TICP Requirement)**
- **Regional SOPs (TICP Requirement)**
- **Communications Focused Exercise (Validation Exercise)**
- **Identified Communications Gaps and Recommendations (Scorecard & After-Action Report)**

These achievements represent significant progress in enhancing tactical interoperable communications across the nation's urban and metropolitan areas.
