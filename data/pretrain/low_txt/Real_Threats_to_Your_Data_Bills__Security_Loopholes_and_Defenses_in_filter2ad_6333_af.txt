### Figure 15: Average CPU Usage of Secure MDC at the UE and Gateway

**Figure 15(a): User Equipment (UE)**
- **CPU Usage (%)**: 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0
- **Status of Secure MDC at UE**: Disabled, Enabled, Triggered

**Figure 15(b): Gateway**
- **CPU Usage (%)**: 40, 30, 20, 10, 0
- **Number of Connection Requests (K)**: 0, 60, 30, 90, 120, 150

**Description:**
Figure 15 illustrates the average CPU usage of the Secure MDC at both the UE (a) and the gateway (b) under different states (i.e., disabled, enabled, and triggered). Each CPU usage slice is 200ms. In each test, we collect a 5-minute trace for the first two states and all samples when our extra processing is triggered.

- **UE CPU Usage:**
  - The UE consumes about 4% CPU usage whether our defense is enabled or disabled.
  - Upon event detection, the CPU usage climbs to 9.2% (average) but only occupies a single slice. This CPU usage is to trigger a process that issues a request or feedback to the gateway.

- **Gateway CPU Usage:**
  - Similar CPU usage patterns are observed at the gateway.
  - The overhead by our defense module is low and affordable.
  - We further run scaling tests at the gateway, plotting the average CPU usage with respect to the number of connection requests when our components are enabled. The CPU usage increases linearly with the number of active connections, indicating that our solution works well with edge routers in the network.

### Impact of Spamming Rate

**Figure 16: Overcharging Volumes with Respect to Spamming Rates**

- **OP-I (a) and OP-II (b)**
  - **Overcharge Volume (Oversubscription Rate)**
    - **w/ Secure MDC**
    - **w/o Secure MDC**
  - **Source Rate (Kbps)**: 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000

**Description:**
Figure 16 shows that our defense can effectively stop spamming as the spamming rate increases. The overcharge volume increases slightly due to communication delay to the gateway.

### Latency Measurement

**Figure 17: Latency of an Explicit Request Over 24 Hours**

- **Latency (ms)**
  - **Implicit**
  - **Explicit**
- **Hour of Day**: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21

**Description:**
Figure 17 measures the latency of sending an explicit request to the gateway using our prototype. The latency is approximately 100ms in our tests.

### Related Work

Several recent studies have assessed the MDC system in cellular networks [21, 22, 27, 28, 36]. These studies primarily explore accounting inaccuracies in normal use or under attacks. Specifically, [28, 36] study the accounting inaccuracy in the presence of weak or no wireless connectivity, user mobility, and policy misconfigurations by operators. Other studies exploit vulnerabilities related to transport-layer traffic (TCP retransmission [21, 22]) and application-layer traffic (DNS, VoIP, and phishing links [27]). These studies provide ad-hoc solutions to secure the MDC system. Unlike these, our work examines vulnerabilities along all three AAA dimensions, stretches several new and practical attacks, and provides comprehensive solutions. We have not seen similar solutions to authentication and authorization in the literature. Some studies [23, 32] focus on pricing schemes, which are related to MDC but orthogonal to the AAA issues we address.

Research on the performance and security aspects of cellular networks has been active in recent years [1, 9, 18, 24, 26, 29–31, 33–35, 38]. These studies cover three broad areas:
1. **Vulnerabilities in Cellular-Specific Technologies:**
   - ID leakage via SIM/USIM card hijacking [1]
   - AKA loopholes in user authentication [9, 26]
   - Battery drain via MMS pushing [31]

2. **Internet Technology in Cellular Networks:**
   - NAT and firewall policies over cellular carriers [38]
   - TCP hijacking attacks [29, 30]
   - Impact of cellular botnets [34]
   - Malicious traffic from one large operational carrier [24]

3. **Interaction Between Cellular Technologies and Data Services:**
   - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks via SMS [18, 33]
   - Generalized DoS attacks [35]

Security and privacy of mobile devices and applications is another active research area [11, 13, 17, 37, 39], independent of the MDC system in this work.

### Conclusion

In this work, we conduct a systematic security analysis of the MDC system in cellular networks. We uncover vulnerabilities in every subsystem of authentication, authorization, and accounting. Simple attacks can be effective, and many cellular operators may still be unaware of such security weaknesses. Our study highlights the fragility of the networked system from a security standpoint, despite the long-term operational success of cellular data charging.
