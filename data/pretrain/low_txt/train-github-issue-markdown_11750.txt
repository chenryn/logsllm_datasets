As illustrated in the attached image, the Markdown syntax highlighter currently recognizes and processes underscores (_) and asterisks (*) within code blocks. I believe these characters should be ignored if they appear within an indented code block.

This issue does not occur when using fenced code blocks. However, indented code blocks are more convenient for my workflow. I hope this is the appropriate place to report this concern.

I am currently using Atom version 0.189.0.
