## SYMBOLIC VERIFIABILITY BY KREMER ET AL.
### APPENDIX A

In this section, we focus on the verifiability definition by Kremer et al. [35], who divide verifiability into three sub-properties:

- **Individual Verifiability:** A voter should be able to check that his vote belongs to the ballot box.
- **Universal Verifiability:** Anyone should be able to check that the result corresponds to the content of the ballot box.
- **Eligibility Verifiability:** Only eligible voters may vote.

Since the proposed formal definition for eligibility verifiability is rather long and technical, we will focus here on individual and universal verifiability.

### A. Model

In symbolic models, messages are represented by terms. Kremer et al. model protocols as processes in the applied-pi calculus [5]. A voting specification is a pair \((V, A)\) where \(V\) is a process that represents the program of a voter, and \(A\) is an evaluation context that represents the (honest) authorities and the infrastructure. All voters are implicitly assumed to be honest.

### B. Individual and Universal Verifiability

We can express the definitions of Kremer et al. independently of the execution model, which slightly extends their definitions.

The symbolic verifiability definition by Kremer et al. [35] assumes that each voter \(V_i\) performs an individual test \(\phi_{IV}^i\), and that observers perform a universal test \(\phi_{UV}\). The individual test \(\phi_{IV}^i\) takes as input the voter's vote and all his local knowledge (e.g., randomness, credentials, and public election data) as well as a partial view of the ballot box (which should correspond to his ballot). The universal test \(\phi_{UV}\) takes as input the outcome of the election, the public election data, the ballot box, and possibly some extra data generated during the protocol used for the purposes of verification. These tests should satisfy the following conditions for any execution.

**Definition 11 (Individual and Universal Verifiability):** A voting specification \((V, A)\) satisfies individual and universal verifiability if for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\),

1. \(\forall i, j : \phi_{IV}^i(b) \land \phi_{IV}^j(b) \Rightarrow i = j\)
2. \(\phi_{UV}(B, r) \land \phi_{UV}(B, r') \Rightarrow r \approx r'\)
3. \(\bigwedge_{i=1}^n \phi_{IV}^i(b_i) \land \phi_{UV}(B, r) \Rightarrow c \approx r\)

where \(c = (c_1, \ldots, c_n)\) are the choices of the voters, \(b\) is an arbitrary ballot, \(B\) is the (content of the) bulletin board, \(r\) and \(r'\) are possible outcomes, and \(\approx\) denotes equality up to permutation.

**Condition (1)** ensures that two distinct voters may not agree on the same ballot, i.e., no clash occurs. **Condition (2)** guarantees the unicity of the outcome: if the observers successfully check the execution, there is at most one outcome they may accept (up to permutation). Finally, **Condition (3)** is the key property: if all tests succeed, the outcome should correspond to the voters' intent. Since all voters are assumed to be honest, the implication \(c \approx r\) in Condition (3) can be described by the goal \(\gamma_0\).

**End-to-end honest verifiability:** Let the goal \(\gamma_{IUV}\) be the sub-goal of \(\gamma_0\) in which all voters produce pairwise different ballots. Then, individual and universal verifiability by Kremer et al. (Definition 11) can essentially be characterized by the fact that the protocol PKRS is \((\gamma_{IUV}, 0)\)-verifiable by the judge \(J\).

To see this, first observe that the judge \(J\) as defined above outputs "accept" if and only if the condition \(\bigwedge_{i=1}^n \phi_{IV}^i(b_i) \land \phi_{UV}(B, r)\) in Condition (3) evaluates to true. As we already pointed out, the implication \(c \approx r\) in Condition (3) describes the goal \(\gamma_0\). Condition (1) stating that there are no clashes between the ballots of honest voters is also satisfied in \(\gamma_{IUV}\) by definition. Thus, for a protocol that achieves individual and universal verifiability according to Definition 11, the probability that the judge \(J\) in PKRS accepts a protocol run in which \(\gamma_{IUV}\) is not fulfilled is negligible (\(\delta = 0\)), i.e., we have \(\Pr[\pi \not\vdash \gamma_{IUV}, (J: \text{accept})] \leq \delta = 0\) with overwhelming probability as in Definition 1.

## SYMBOLIC VERIFIABILITY BY CORTIER ET AL.
### APPENDIX B

In this section, we study the symbolic verifiability definition by Cortier et al. [18]. Cortier et al. also define different notions of verifiability: individual, universal, and end-to-end verifiability. They prove that under the assumption of an additional property called "no clash," individual and universal verifiability imply end-to-end verifiability in their symbolic model.

### A. Model

As in [35], the definitions of Cortier et al. are cast in a symbolic model. That is, messages are represented by terms, and protocols are defined as symbolic processes. Additionally, Cortier et al. assume that voters reach several successive states denoted as follows:

- **Vote(i, c, cred):** The voter \(i\) with credential \(cred\) is willing to cast a choice \(c\).
- **MyBallot(i, c, b):** The voter \(i\) has prepared a ballot \(b\) corresponding to the choice \(c\).
- **VHappy(i, c, cred, B):** The voter \(i\) with credential \(cred\) has cast a choice \(c\) and is happy with the content of the ballot box \(B\).

Cortier et al. [18] also assume a judge that checks whether a result \(r\) corresponds to a ballot box \(B\) and reaches a state \(JHappy(B, r)\) whenever this is the case.

After the casting and before the tallying, some ballots may be removed because they are invalid (e.g., due to flawed signatures or zero-knowledge proofs) or simply because some voters have voted several times and only the last vote counts. This yields a "sanitized" list of ballots \(B_{san}\).

### B. Individual Verifiability

Intuitively, individual verifiability by Cortier et al. holds true if whenever honest voters perform the checks prescribed by the protocol, then their ballots belong to the ballot box.

### C. Discussion

Definition 11 is tailored to a specific tally: the outcome of the election has to be the sequence of the votes. Moreover, the definition assumes that the ballot of the voter can be retrieved from the ballot box, which does not apply to ThreeBallot, for example. The main restriction is that all voters are assumed to be honest.

By Condition (3), the goal \(\gamma_0\) is guaranteed only for protocol runs in which all voters successfully verify their ballots (and the universal test is positive). For the other runs, the outcome can be arbitrary. However, the assumption that all honest voters verify their ballot is unrealistically strong. Therefore, even though this definition uses the strong goal \(\gamma_0\), this assumption makes the definition weak.

### D. Casting in the KTV Framework

**Protocol PKRS:** The set of agents \(\Sigma\) consists of the voters, the bulletin board \(B\), the judge \(J\), and the remaining participants.
