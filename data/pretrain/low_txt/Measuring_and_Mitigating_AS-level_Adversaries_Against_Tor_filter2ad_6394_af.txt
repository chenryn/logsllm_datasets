### VI. DISCUSSION

In this section, we compare the Astoria Tor client with the hypothetical perfect Tor client and discuss how Astoria can be augmented and improved with recent and ongoing developments from the network measurement community.

#### A. Comparing Astoria and the Perfect Tor Client

Here, we highlight some of the limitations of Astoria when compared to the idealized perfect Tor client. Many of these limitations apply to any AS-aware client. The perfect Tor client is capable of simultaneously achieving three conflicting goals:

1. **Defend Against Network-Level Attackers:**
   - The perfect Tor client can prevent compromise from network-level attackers by constructing circuits that are resilient to traffic correlation attacks.
   - While the standard Tor client largely ignores such adversaries, Astoria addresses them by using efficient path-prediction tools to avoid relays that enable correlation attacks. However, Astoria does not currently handle active network-level adversaries that exploit BGP dynamics. Additionally, Astoria cannot precisely predict the paths used for communication with each Tor relay, relying instead on reasonably accurate estimates.

2. **Defend Against Relay-Level Attackers:**
   - Given the volunteer-driven nature of the Tor network, it is crucial for the perfect Tor client to defend against both passive and active attackers who control a fraction of the relays.
   - This involves (1) constructing circuits so that the probability of an adversarial pair of relays occupying the entry and exit hops is low, and (2) ensuring no single relay can conclusively link the source and destination of the circuits.
   - Although the standard Tor client mitigates many relay-level threats, AS-aware clients like Astoria face challenges. The use of entry guards, while effective, reduces the number of safe circuits that AS-aware clients can build. Furthermore, AS-aware circuits inherently leak some information about the source and destination. Our analysis in Section V-D shows that, on average, Astoria circuits are safe from de-anonymization due to these leaks.

3. **Maintain Performance and Load-Balancing:**
   - The perfect Tor client must perform load-balancing to ensure no single set of relays is overloaded while providing reasonable performance for all users.
   - In Section V, we demonstrated that Astoria performs load-balancing similarly to the standard Tor client, with only slightly slower page-load times. The increased page-load times are primarily due to (1) the computational cost of path prediction and (2) the loss of the ability to pre-emptively construct circuits. While (1) is unavoidable, there are interesting research questions regarding (2), such as whether smart caching and predictive circuit construction for popular destinations could significantly improve performance.

#### B. Improving Path-Prediction Accuracy

Measuring the potential threat of correlation attacks is challenging because it requires measuring both forward and reverse network paths between the client, entry, and exit nodes, and the destination. To address this, we use an up-to-date map of the Internet's topology, augmented with inferred business relationships between networks and a model of routing policies to infer network paths.

Modeling interdomain routing is complex, and we take care to avoid common pitfalls, including complex business relationships (e.g., ASes acting as customers in one region and peers in others) and sibling ASes (multiple ASes controlled by a single organization). Sibling ASes are particularly relevant, as they may share information to perform correlation attacks. Despite these efforts, accurate path prediction remains an open challenge. In a related study, we validated the accuracy of our approach and found that measured paths follow the model 65-85% of the time [10]. Therefore, our results should be considered as estimates of the threat.

We note that novel path measurement tools, such as Sibyl [17], are on the horizon. These tools consider richer vantage point sets than previous work (e.g., PlanetLab used by iPlane [28] vs. RIPE Atlas [35] used by Sibyl). An interesting future direction is determining how such measurement planes can be integrated into a Tor client, either in an offline mode or via a secured querying interface.

### VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have leveraged highly-optimized algorithmic simulations of interdomain routing on empirically-derived AS-level topologies to quantify the potential for correlation attacks where an adversary can leverage asymmetric Internet routing and collude with others within the same organization. Our results show that a significant number of Tor circuits are vulnerable to AS- and state-level attackers.

To mitigate these threats, we developed Astoria—an AS-aware Tor client. Beyond providing a high level of security against these attacks, Astoria also maintains performance within a reasonable distance from the current Tor client. Unlike other AS-aware Tor clients, Astoria considers circuit construction in the worst case, i.e., when no safe relays are available. Additionally, Astoria is designed to ensure that all circuits created by it are load-balanced across the volunteer-driven Tor network.

Our work highlights the importance of applying current models and data from network measurements to inform relay selection, protecting against timing attacks. Astoria also opens multiple avenues for future work, such as integrating real-time hijack and interception detection systems (to fully counter RAPTOR [39] attacks) and understanding how new measurement services can be leveraged by a Tor client without compromising anonymity.
