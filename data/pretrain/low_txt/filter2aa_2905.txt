### Inspiration – "System Intruder"
"Well… There's malware on the interwebs. They're pwning all your systems, snatching your data up. So hide your cards, hide your docs, and hide your phone, 'cause they're pwning er'body out there!" – Zero Cool

### Introduction – Why give a "Freakshow"?
Exploits have become commodities, and malware fuels the business of crime. As Zero Cool put it, "They're pwning er'body out there!"

---

### Introduction – What’s this about?
This is the third iteration of this talk:
- **2009**: KeyLogger, MemDumper, Video Poker, Sniffer
- **2010**: MemDumper, Logon Credentials Stealer, Sniffer, Client-Side (PDF Malware)

New Targets This Year:
- Your Grocery Store
- Your Favorite Bar
- Your Work
- Your Smart Phone

### Evolution of Malware

**2009**
- Sloppy malware developers
- Just "testing the waters"
- No covert file system placement
- Noisy output files
- Easily detected using Task Manager

**2010**
- Started to use "tricky" names for executables
- Located in "system" folders
- Output still mainly in plain text and written to disk
- Advanced tools can easily detect them
- Automated exfiltration in certain instances

**2011**
- Malware developers have grown up
- Completely subverting process analysis tools
- Many instances of ZERO data storage
- When data is stored, it is ENCRYPTED
- More efficient methods resulting in a small footprint
- Automation is "everywhere they want to be"

### Evolution of Malware – Network Sniffers

| Year | Notables |
|------|----------|
| 2009 | Obvious filenames, plain text output (.cap extension), attacker's FTP credentials in executable |
| 2010 | Filenames matched Windows system files, output compressed and password-protected, nightly auto-exfiltration functionality appeared |
| 2011 | No output on disk, malware utilizes buffers (one to sniff, one to export), real-time data exfiltration, encryption/encoding of output data |

---

### Evolution of Malware – Memory Dumper

| Year | Notables |
|------|----------|
| 2009 | Malware kit required 3 executable files, no anti-forensics capabilities, plain text output in "system" folders |
| 2010 | Single executable, kernel rootkit, plain text output in "system folders" |
| 2011 | Return of 3 executable files, but output file: time-stomped after each update, encrypted |

---

### Evolution of Malware – Advanced Techniques
- Anti-forensic features are built into malware.
- Stolen data is stored encrypted, with advanced encryption algorithms.
- Automated exfiltration features are built-in so attackers don’t have to keep coming back.
- Data commonly exported on port 80, which is usually allowed for outbound access in most organizations.
- Time-stomping is common.
- Malware often appears as a DLL injected into critical processes.

### Sample SL2010-161 – Kameo

**Vitals**
- Code Name: Best Supporting Actor
- Filename: Kameo.exe
- File Type: PE 32-bit
- Target Platform: Windows

**Key Features**
- Minimal file and registry activity.
- Sniffs magnetic stripe data of credit cards and stores it in buffer XYZ.
- In a separate thread, sends data in buffer XYZ to hacker server via port 80.
- Exported data is encoded to defeat monitoring tools.
- No storage of intercepted data on disk at any time.

**Victim**: Your Grocery Store

**Demo**: [Demo]

### Sample SL2011-014 – Memory Dumper

**Vitals**
- Code Name: Son of Brain Drain
- Filename: Winboot.exe
- File Type: PE 32-bit
- Target Platform: Windows

**Key Features**
- Installed as a Windows service.
- Invokes two other processes: one dumps memory of processes, the other parses data.
- Malware executables are time-stomped to OS install time.
- Output file is time-stomped despite regular read/writes.
- Output file is encrypted.

**Victim**: Your Favorite Bar

**Demo**: [Demo]

### Sample SL2011-026 – Webcheck.dll

**Vitals**
- Code Name: Napoleon's Victory
- Filename: Webcheck.dll
- File Type: Win32 DLL
- Target Platform: Windows

**Key Features**
- 10KB DLL injected into explorer.exe.
- Packed so strings can’t be read.
- Monitors a specific process and records data processed by it in a hidden and encrypted file.
- At 2am, data is FTP’ed to the attacker’s server.
- Outgoing file is encrypted and has a .zip extension but is not actually a zip file.

**Victim**: Your Work

**Demo**: [Demo]

### Sample SL2011-039 – Android Malware

**Vitals**
- Code Name: ZiTFO (aka Zitmo)
- Filename: zitmo.apk
- File Type: Android Package
- Target Platform: Android

**Key Features**
- Registers an intent filter looking for SMS_RECEIVED events.
- Sets this filter with a priority of 1000 (highest).
- Prevents everything else from seeing SMS messages.
- Sends the content of the message to the attacker’s website.
- Does NOT perform any form of content analysis.
- Attackers likely collect a lot of junk texts.
- Appears on the phone as a package by Trusteer called "Rapport," used by banks to prevent this type of SMS interception attack.

**Victim**: You

**Demo**: [Android Demo]

### Conclusions
- **Windows Malware**: Has matured significantly over the last three years.
- **Mobile Malware**: Is just beginning but is a rapidly growing area.
- **Future Predictions**:
  - iOS/Android Malware with advanced features
  - Mobile DDoS and Spam Bots
  - Malware focused on stealing corporate credentials
