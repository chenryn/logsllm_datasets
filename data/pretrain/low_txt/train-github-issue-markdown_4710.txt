Please review the attached test case. The conversion from `String` to `Set` works correctly in version 3.0.5, but fails in version 3.0.6. In the newer version, the elements are being converted to the collection type rather than the type of the collection's elements.

The specific revision and bug that caused this issue are discussed in the forum thread referenced below.
