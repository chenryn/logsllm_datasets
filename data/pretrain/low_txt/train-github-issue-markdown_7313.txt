### Problem Description
In the Chrome Developer Tools network tab, when you right-click an item and select "Open in new tab," it appears that nothing happens. Specifically:
- No action is visible in the user interface.
- No relevant information is logged to the command line.
- The expected `new-window` event is not triggered.

### Proposed Solution
I propose that the "Open in new tab" option should trigger the `new-window` event on the `devToolsWebContents` (or possibly the `webContents` itself). This would allow Electron developers to handle this event in the same manner as other `new-window` events.
