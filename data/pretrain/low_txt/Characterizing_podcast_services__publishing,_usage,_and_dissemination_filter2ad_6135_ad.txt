### Dissemination Methods for Podcast Episodes

The buffer of users can act as relays, propagating podcast episodes to other users. The choice of dissemination method is influenced by several factors, including the rate and cost of downloads, and the users' tolerance to delays. For instance, are users willing to play podcast episodes immediately after publication, or can they wait until they have a direct Internet connection?

If users have a high delay tolerance, typically more than one day, the most economical and efficient method for downloading podcast episodes is through a direct Internet connection, such as at home. However, for time-critical content like news or sports podcasts, users may need to rely on 3G cellular networks or peer-to-peer (P2P) assisted communication.

It is worth noting that many 3G wireless providers offer push-based services for broadcasting news, such as live sports updates. However, the volume of information broadcasted through these services is limited and much lower than the typical volume of podcast episodes. Downloading podcast episodes through 3G networks can be costly, especially in roaming situations. Providers like Sprint and AT&T typically impose a monthly download cap, often around 5 GB, with significantly lower limits (a few hundred MB) when roaming. Therefore, users may prefer free P2P-assisted systems for downloading podcast episodes, especially if they subscribe to multiple podcasts.

### Investigating Peer-to-Peer Assisted Podcast Dissemination

In this section, we explore the opportunity and feasibility of P2P-assisted podcast dissemination. We first examine user delay tolerance for playing podcast episodes, the typical volume of episodes users need to download over a month, and the feasibility of device-to-device communication. Specifically, we investigate whether device-to-device contact times are sufficient to transfer one or several typical podcast episodes.

#### User Delay Tolerance

To understand the delay tolerance of users, we analyze the virtual age of podcast episodes, which is the difference between the publish time and the first play time by distinct users. Figure 29 shows the distribution of virtual ages, indicating a median virtual age of around 10 days. This suggests that users are generally delay-tolerant, with a significant portion of episodes being played a month or longer after publication. Interestingly, playing on mobile devices typically occurs sooner after the publish time compared to personal computers.

Figure 30 further refines this analysis by removing biases due to high-rate publish podcasts and popular podcasts. The median of median virtual ages over podcasts remains around 10 days (11.73 days), consistent with the observations in Figure 29.

We also examined whether the episodes of more popular podcasts are played sooner than those of less popular ones. Figure 31 shows the virtual age versus the total number of subscriptions, revealing that the mean virtual age remains roughly constant across a wide range of subscription numbers. This lack of bias with respect to podcast popularity is an important observation.

#### Volume of Downloads

To evaluate the volume of podcasting content that needs to be downloaded by a typical subscriber, we computed the download rate per user. Figure 32 shows the distribution of the download rate per user, measured in bytes per week, with a median download rate of about 65 MB per week. This corresponds to approximately 2 to 3 files, given that the typical file size is in the range of 20 to 30 MB. Figure 33 confirms this, showing the distribution of the download rate in files per week, with a median download rate of about 1/4 GB per month. A significant portion of users have a download rate ranging from 10 MB to 1 GB per week.

Given the data caps imposed by wireless service providers, transferring large volumes of podcast content through 3G networks can be costly. Therefore, P2P-assisted systems may be more attractive, especially for users who subscribe to multiple podcasts.

#### Feasibility of Device-to-Device Communication

For P2P-assisted dissemination, we consider the efficiency of device-to-device communications. Table 5 shows the required contact durations for transferring a 20 MB file under different transfer rates. Standard physical transfer rates suggest that transferring a 20 MB podcast file may take a few hundred seconds, which exceeds typical contact durations. This indicates that file slicing into smaller chunks may be necessary to improve the utilization of contact transfer opportunities.

### Related Work

Previous studies on podcasting services have been limited. Banerjee et al. [3] were among the first to examine the characteristics of podcasts by downloading content from 875 podcast streams. They analyzed properties such as file sizes, release times, and proposed a model for file generation. Our study differs in both the set of properties examined and the scale of the podcasts analyzed.

Cha et al. [9] conducted a study of user-generated content on YouTube and Daum, focusing on content popularity and observing the Pareto principle. While our analysis confirms this for podcast content, our focus is on push-based podcast services, contrasting with the pull-based model of YouTube.

Lenders et al. [12] proposed an architecture for a P2P-assisted podcast dissemination system for mobile devices and examined several device-to-device content dissemination strategies through simulations. Our work differs in that it is based on real-world data from a podcasting service, allowing us to evaluate the actual benefits and feasibility of P2P-assisted dissemination.

### Conclusion

This paper presents an exhaustive statistical analysis of current podcast services, using a 70-day trace from the Zune podcast social service. We characterized the statistical properties of podcasts, including their publishers, types, content, sizes, and release frequencies. We also investigated the popularity of podcasts and how users subscribe to them based on their popularity. Our findings indicate that current podcasts are often consumed long after their release, suggesting that efficient dissemination is feasible even with sporadic Internet access. This observation may change in the future with the increasing popularity of interactive podcasts.
