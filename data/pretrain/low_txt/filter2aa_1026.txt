### Why Build an EV?

Currently, there are limited production electric vehicles (EVs) available. Converting an existing internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle to an EV can be a practical and rewarding alternative. Building your own EV offers several benefits:
- **Pioneering the EV Movement:** Be part of the growing trend towards sustainable transportation.
- **Recycling and Reuse:** Give new life to a vehicle that might otherwise end up in a junkyard.
- **Immediate Availability:** Don't wait for mass-produced EVs; build one yourself.

A typical EV conversion can achieve a range of 30-60 miles per charge, which is sufficient for most daily commutes. Studies show that 80% of commuters travel less than 40 miles per day, and 50% travel 20 miles or less. 

**Environmental and Financial Benefits:**
- **Zero Emissions:** EVs produce no tailpipe emissions.
- **Cleaner Full Fuel Cycle:** When considering the full cycle of electricity generation, EVs are up to 99% cleaner than gasoline and diesel vehicles.
- **Lower Operating Costs:** EV owners enjoy significantly lower fuel and maintenance expenses.
- **Reduced Oil Dependence:** EVs help decrease our reliance on fossil fuels.

### Steps Involved in an EV Conversion

This overview provides a high-level framework for converting an ICE vehicle to an EV. For more detailed information, please refer to the resources and links provided in the next section.

1. **Determine Your Driving Needs:**
   - **Range:** The distance you travel in a single day.
   - **Vehicle Type:** Family car, commuter vehicle, utility vehicle, or racing car.

2. **Select an EV Kit:**
   - Look for an EV kit suitable for your chosen vehicle. Kits typically include all necessary components except batteries.
   - **Cost Estimate:**
     - **Conversion Kit:** $4,000-$6,000
     - **Batteries:** $700-$1,200, depending on the number required.

3. **Prepare for the Conversion:**
   - Ensure you have access to the proper tools, supplies, and a suitable workspace.
   - You may need to rent equipment like engine hoists and contract out welding work.
   - Seek advice and assistance from experienced EV builders.

4. **Familiarize Yourself with EV Components:**
   - Common batteries for EV conversions are lead-acid, specifically 12-volt sealed batteries.

5. **Safety First:**
   - Any project involving automobiles and tools has inherent risks. Be aware of potential hazards to prevent damage to the vehicle and serious injury.

6. **Remove ICE Components:**
   - Remove the internal combustion engine and related components to make room for the EV system.

7. **Install EV Components:**
   - Install the motor, battery box, and batteries.

8. **Wiring and Controls:**
   - Install the wiring for the propulsion (traction pack), auxiliary power system (12-volt system), traction pack charging system, displays, and controls.

9. **Safety Testing:**
   - Test the battery charger, check the wiring and fuses, and ensure all connections are secure.
   - Take the vehicle for a test drive and experience the quiet, smooth ride.
   - Show off your newly converted EV!
