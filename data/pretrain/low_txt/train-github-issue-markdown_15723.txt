I recently returned to the HTML/CSS and jQuery sections to complete some of the new challenges added in the latest update. However, after finishing a challenge and clicking "Next," the system directs me to a lesson I have already completed (the next one in the sequence) rather than the next incomplete lesson. Additionally, it gives me credit for completing the lesson again, which is reflected in the "Items Completed" count in the corner.

**Issue:** I am receiving credit for lessons that I have already completed in the past when I redo them.
