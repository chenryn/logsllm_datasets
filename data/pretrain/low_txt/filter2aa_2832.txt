## Introduction to the Teensy
- **Origin**: Initially covered by Adrian Crenshaw (irongeek)
- **Evolution**: Transformed into a penetration testing tool at Defcon last year
- **Capabilities**: Emulates any keyboard and leverages full character sets with on-board storage
- **Variants**: Teensy, Teensy++, Customized Motion Sensor Teensy (thanks to Garland)

### Basic Usage
- **Binary to Keyboard-Acceptable Characters**: Convert binary data to hex or base64 for transmission.
- **Conversion Back to Binary**: Use PowerShell to convert hex back to binary when written to a file via the Teensy. PowerShell is integrated into Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7 and cannot be removed.

### Challenges
- **File Size Limitation**: The Teensy++ could not handle large files after conversion to hex or base64.
- **Alternative Solution**: Use `shellcodeexec` for DEP/NX enabled systems, which stores shellcode as +rwx and supports alphanumeric encoded payloads.

### Demo
- **Steps**:
  1. Compile `shellcodeexec` and convert to hex.
  2. Create a meterpreter reverse_tcp via alphanumeric shellcode.
  3. Execute `shellcodeexec` and launch the shellcode into memory without touching the disk.

### Additional Features
- **SDCard Mount**: Soldered an SDCard mount to the Teensy, allowing the transfer of larger files onto the system.

## Broadband over Power Lines (BPL)
### Overview
- **Standards**:
  - IEEE 1901-2010: Broadband over Power Lines
  - IEEE 1675-2008: Broadband hardware installation
  - G.hn: Competing standard (used by AT&T)
  - X10, Crestron, Lutron, Z-Wave
- **New Tools Release**: New tools for leveraging BPL in penetration testing
- **Future Developments**: Ongoing projects in development

### BPL Characteristics
- **Speeds**: 500KB to 135MBPS (home plug certification)
- **Usage**: Ethernet over power lines, primarily for home networking but also used in some corporate environments
- **HomePlug AV Specification**: Increased peak data from 14 MBPS to 200 MBPS
- **Smart Grid Infrastructures**: Uses HomePlug PHY for smart grid communications

### Understanding BPL
- **Design**: Normal wiring systems are designed for AC power transmission.
- **Drawbacks**: Limited capacity for higher frequencies.
- **Security**: Most home/corporate security uses 56-bit DES.
- **Frequencies**: Corporate use typically transmits at 1.6 to 80MHz, while home use is 20 to 200kHz.
- **Applications**: Car network communications, HVAC systems, security systems, and more.

### PHY Smart Grids
- **Long-Range Transmissions**: Network signals through multiple power lines.
- **Low-Cost Implementation**: Used by virtually every country.
- **Wired and Wireless**: Supports both wired and wireless transmissions.
- **Standardization**: The PHY Alliance and Zigbee Alliance have collaborated to create a single standard.

### Home Ethernet over Power
- **Encryption**: Supports DES (default off) or AES.
- **Device Support**: Allows multiple devices to plug in for power over Ethernet.
- **Penetration Testing**: Excellent for penetration testing scenarios.

### Real-World Scenario
- **Physical Penetration Test**: Place a BPL device near a company within the corporate environment.
- **Access Points**: Find exposed power jacks inside or outside the organization to perform the test.

## Home Automation
### Overview
- **Main Standards**:
  - X10 (60 Hz over powerlines)
  - Z-Wave (900 MHz)
- **Other Standards**:
  - Crestron
  - Lutron (433 MHz)
  - Zigbee (2.4GHz, 915 MHz, 868 MHz)
  - Insteon (dual band powerlines and RF)

### Home Automation Basics
- **Usage**: Used in large businesses, homes, and other facilities.
- **Interconnectivity**: Provides automated responses based on predefined criteria.
- **Growth**: Gaining momentum in most organizations.

### X10 Basics
- **Usage**: Highly used in home automation.
- **Communication**: Devices communicate through power lines and some RF.
- **Equipment**: HVAC, motion sensors, lights, cameras, security systems, doors.

### Drawbacks of X10
- **No Encryption**
- **Limited Devices**: Only 256 devices allowed
- **Interference**: Can experience heavy interference

### X10 Codes
- **All Units Off**: 0 0 0 0
- **All Lights On**: 0 0 0 1
- **On**: 0 0 1 0
- **Off**: 0 0 1 1
- **Dim**: 0 1 0 0
- **Bright**: 0 1 0 1
- **Extended Code**: 0 1 1 1
- **Hail Request**: 1 0 0 0
- **Hail Acknowledge**: 1 0 0 1
- **Pre-set Dim**: 1 0 1 x
- **Status is On**: 1 1 0 1
- **Status is Off**: 1 1 1 0
- **Status Request**: 1 1 1 1

### X10 Kit
- **Testing**: Jammer/sniffer using Arduino

### New Tool Releases
- **X10 Blackout** (Social-Engineer Toolkit v2.0):
  - Jams X10 signals to prevent security systems from triggering.
  - Illegal if used via RF, but hypothetically possible.
- **X10 Sniffer** (Social-Engineer Toolkit v2.0):
  - Sniffs all X10 traffic and sends information.
  - Can trigger on certain events, e.g., jamming security systems.
  - Currently writes to external storage, with plans to send data via text messages.

### Z-Wave
- **Mesh Networks**: Communication between devices.
- **AES Support**: Not widely used.
- **Jamming**: Simple and can cause significant disruptions.
- **Sniffing and Injection**: Easy to develop Z-Wave-based sniffers and injectors.
- **Data Injection**: Ability to inject seamless data, including replay of camera feeds.

### AES Encryption Exposure
- **Pairing**: During initial pairing, the AES initialization key can be captured, allowing decryption and tampering.
- **Non-Compliance**: Does not follow FIPS-compliant transmission of AES keys.

### Coming Soon
- **Z-Wave Sniffer**: Based on Z-Wave initialization encryption keys.
- **Sniffer and Injector**: Send information to Z-Wave systems.
