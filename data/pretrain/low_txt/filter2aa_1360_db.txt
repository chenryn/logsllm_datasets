### Interview

**Username Search and Email Discovery:**
When conducting a username search, I frequently uncover confirmed email addresses from several years prior. These emails open up new possibilities when input into our search tools. In 2019, I discovered an otherwise unknown email address associated with my target username. This email had been used to post on a hacking forum in 2002. The only identifiable information was "JohnDoe." This new email account was linked to a unique password within the Myspace breach data. By searching this password, I identified additional email accounts in other breach datasets. Further searches within Usenet data revealed the true name of my target. Everyone makes a mistake eventually.

**Investigating News Figures:**
Whenever I come across a serial killer, active shooter, or any other deranged individual in the news, I check for their presence in old newsgroups. If the subject was tech-savvy in the 1990s, I often find interesting evidence that is missed by most news media.

**Ransomware and Stealer Logs:**
- **Google Search Queries:**
  - `site:https://app.hacknotice.com "onion"`
  - `"stealer logs" "download"`
  - `"stealer logs" "Azorult"`
  - `"stealer logs" "Vidar"`
  - `"stealer logs" "Redline"`
  - `"stealer logs" "Raccoon"`

These queries should lead you to the best URLs for accessing relevant information. Additionally, the following Google search can help you find pages on the Hack Notice website that announce ransomware publications:
- `site:https://app.hacknotice.com "ransomware"`

Opening these pages will display a notice of ransomware intrusion. Clicking the title of the article will present the Tor URL, which may contain the stolen data. Clicking "View Original Source" on this new page will attempt to open the Tor URL in your browser. I have discovered terabytes of data using this method. While I could dedicate another chapter to identifying valuable ransomware data, I must stop here. If you have made it this far, you have the skills to continue your own journey into ransomware exposure.

**Real-World Application:**
In 2021, I was investigating an unknown person harassing one of my clients. The individual was using a throwaway email address that seemed impossible to trace. It was not present in any breach data. However, it appeared in my stealer logs, which included a device name similar to `Desktop-u3ty6`. Searching this device identifier revealed dozens of email addresses and passwords used on that machine. This quickly led me to identify the suspect as a 15-year-old kid. Further investigation confirmed that his computer became infected after downloading a pirated version of antivirus software. The irony.

**Stealer Logs:**
If you found historic breach credentials valuable, recent stealer logs should be even more exciting. These are text files containing usernames, email addresses, passwords, browser autofill data, IP addresses, screen captures, and system details from computers infected with a virus. If you download pirated software from shady websites, there is a good chance it is infected. When installed, malicious files begin monitoring your daily activity and upload collected data to rented servers. Criminals then sell this data online. Since the passwords are fresh, they are more likely to be accurate with current credentials. This presents a terrible situation for victims but an amazing opportunity for investigators. Use the following Google queries, but be cautious as they often lead to shady criminal marketplaces requiring an account to see download links:
- `"stealer logs" "download"`
- `"stealer logs" "Azorult"`
- `"stealer logs" "Vidar"`
- `"stealer logs" "Redline"`
- `"stealer logs" "Raccoon"`

**Disk Space Warning:**
If you replicate all these steps within a VM allocated with a small disk (less than 100GB), expect to run out of space. For regular data breaches and leaks, consider a dedicated Linux host. Using an external drive can lead to frustration, complications, and slow queries. The methods presented can be conducted in any operating system with the proper utilities installed. I use a dedicated Linux laptop with a 4TB SSD internal drive for my data collection. My queries are fast, and I never worry about disk space. My Linux OS provides protection from malicious software, and this machine is never used for online investigations.

**IntelTechniques Breaches & Leaks Tool:**
This final search tool combines most of the online search options mentioned throughout the chapter. The breach data resources are categorized based on the target data (email, username, etc.). The last feature allows you to enter any found password and immediately generate MD5, SHA1, and SHA-256 hashes for further research. Figure 28.05 displays the current view.

**OSINT Methodology:**
This section covers workflow, documentation, and the ethics of online investigations. We present numerous document templates and workflow diagrams, available for digital download at the following URL. I rely heavily on Jason Edison, a 20-year veteran of a major U.S. police department and an official IntelTechniques OSINT instructor. Most of the content in this section is from him, though I maintain the first-person usage of "I."

**Receiving the OSINT Mission:**
The first step in most investigations is what we in law enforcement refer to as "intake." This involves receiving a mission assignment from a supervisor or a request for investigative support. For those in the private sector, this might be accepting a contract investigation from a client or conducting a security assessment. Examples of OSINT requests include:
- Threat Assessments (Individuals)
- Threat Assessments (Events)
- Target Profiles (Individuals)
- Target Profiles (Organizations)
- Subscriber Identification/Account Attribution

**Triage:**
Triage is the practice of assessing a situation to determine the best approach. A common mistake in OSINT investigations is rushing without a clear plan. Take time to ensure you are on a productive path. Key considerations during the triage phase include:
- Clarifying the mission objectives
- Considering legal service and preservation letters
- Deconfliction with other agencies

**Note-Taking and Key Questions/Goals:**
- Find the real name associated with PI:EMAIL
- Find any home and/or work addresses for PI:EMAIL
- Using Chrome, Google search PI:EMAIL

By staying organized and having a repeatable process, you can ensure a professional and effective investigation.
