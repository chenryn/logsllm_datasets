# Presentation: Legal and Ethical Considerations in Security Research

## Disclaimer
- This presentation is not legal advice about your specific situation.
- This presentation does not create an attorney-client relationship.
- While these approaches are designed to reduce risk, they cannot eliminate it.

## Overview
- Types of Risks to Researchers
- Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Disclosure Options
- Risk Mitigation for Selling Exploits
- Your Goal: Be a Harder Target

## Risks in Disclosing or Selling Research
### Examples:
- You discovered how to view other people’s utility bills by altering the HTTP query string.
- You found that your neighbor’s WiFi is using the default password.
- You broke the cryptography protecting media.
- You developed a more advanced Remote Access Trojan (RAT).

Many of the same risks apply in these scenarios.

## What Are We Talking About?
**Techniques:**
- Information related to both exploits and vulnerabilities that enable another party to:
  - Obtain unauthorized access to a computer.
  - Deny access to others.
  - Cause permanent or temporary damage to a computer or network.

## When Is There Risk?
### Threats of Legal Action Before Conference or Disclosure
- **Chris Paget (IOActive) at Black Hat 2007**
- **Princeton Prof. Felten at USENIX 2001**

### Injunction Barring Disclosure Before Conference or Disclosure
- **Megamos at USENIX 2013**
- **MIT - Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority at DEF CON 2008**

### Legal Actions Initiated After Conference or Disclosure
- **Cisco - Michael Lynn (ISS) at Black Hat 2005**: Civil lawsuit filed after the talk.
- **Dmitry Sklyarov at DEF CON**: Taken into custody in Las Vegas after the presentation.

## Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
- **Accesses “without authorization”**
- **“Exceeds authorized access”**
- By deployment or development effort

### Key Questions
- Are you connected to the internet?
- Are you accessing a remote system?
- Do you have permission to access that system?

### Conspiracy to Violate the CFAA
- Risk enhanced by social media

### CFAA Risk Example Cases
- **Criminal Prosecution:**
  - **Nestor (exploited video poker bug)**: CFAA charge dropped.
  - **Nosal (terms of use)**: No CFAA violation, 9th Circuit.
  - **Aaron Swartz (spoofed MAC address)**
  - **Andrew Auernheimer (conspiracy to script HTTP queries to public API)**
  - **U.S. v. Schaffer**: "Conspiracy to hack a honeypot may still violate the CFAA."
- **Civil Prosecution:**
  - Available on the same grounds to private parties.

### Risk Mitigation: CFAA
- **18 U.S.C. §1030(a)(1)**: Avoid knowingly accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access.
- **18 U.S.C. §1030(a)(2)**: Avoid intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access.
- **Avoid Unintentionally Creating Knowledge and Intent:**
  - Do not direct technique information to someone you suspect or should know is likely to use it illegally.
  - Be careful in providing “support.”
  - Consider not providing technique information directly to any individuals and limit distribution to websites only.
  - Do not promote the disclosure on forums known to support or promote illegal activity.
  - If published on a website, consider disabling comments to avoid the possibility of users discussing illegal use on your site.
  - Do not maintain logs.

## Risk Mitigation: Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)
- **Goal**: Avoid a TRO.
- **Factors**:
  1. Will the requestor suffer irreparable harm if the TRO does not issue?
  2. Will there be even greater harm to the researcher if the TRO does issue?
  3. The public interest.
  4. Likelihood the requestor will ultimately prevail.

### Strategies
- Avoid use of copyrighted material.
- Be aware of any pre-existing relationships with possible targets of the technique (e.g., Terms of Service, End User License Agreement, Non-Disclosure Agreement, Employment Agreements).
- Necessity of risk mitigation depends on the nature of the research.
- If research techniques were questionable, do not publish the identity of the target system.

## Disclosure Options
### Option #1: Disclose to Responsible Party
- **High Risk**:
  - If techniques used were questionable.
  - If planning to present at a conference or publish (TRO).
- **Low Risk**:
  - If submitted anonymously and OPSEC is good.
  - If to a bug bounty and no questionable techniques used.

### Option #2: Disclose to Government Authority
- **High Risk**:
  - If techniques used were questionable.
  - If anonymity is desired.
- **Low Risk**:
  - If submitted anonymously and OPSEC is good.

### Option #3: Pilot TTP Disclosure Program
- **Researcher discloses vulnerability to a trusted third party (TTP attorney) only.**
  - Maintains attorney-client privilege.
- **TTP discloses vulnerability to responsible party.**
- **TTP [does | does not] publish the vulnerability on behalf of the researcher after y days.**
- **Researcher can remain anonymous [temporarily | permanently].**
- **Researcher maintains control of the disclosure process.**

## Selling: The Current Situation
### The NDAA Senate Bill
- **Interagency Process**: To control the proliferation of cyber weapons through unilateral and cooperative export controls, law enforcement activities, financial means, diplomatic engagement, and other appropriate means.

### The NDAA Committee Report
- **Global Black Market and Gray Market**: Dangerous software is actively traded.
- **Developing Definitions and Categories**: For controlled cyber technologies, addressing dual use, lawful intercept, and penetration testing technologies.

### The European Directive
- **Article 7**: Tools used for committing offenses.
- **Whereas (16)**: Motivated by the need to avoid criminalization where tools are produced and put on the market for legitimate purposes, such as testing the reliability of IT products or the security of information systems.

## Selling: Risk Mitigation
- **Create Dual-Use Tools**: Example: Copy II Plus.
- **Know Your Buyer**: Avoid embargoed countries (EU, US, UN).
- **Ask for Assurances from the Buyer**.
- **Use Disclaimer Language**:
  - Compliance with Law: Customer acknowledges that the software can be configured to obtain access to information using penetration techniques that may cause disruption. The customer agrees to use the software only on devices under their authorized control and to comply with all federal, state, and local laws.
  - Prohibition of Use: The customer agrees not to use the products for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including the development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missile, or chemical or biological weapons.
