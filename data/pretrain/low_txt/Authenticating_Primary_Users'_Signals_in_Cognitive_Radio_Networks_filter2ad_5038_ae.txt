### 3. Trade-off Between Probability of False Alarm and Probability of False Negative

We analyze the trade-off between the probability of false alarm (PFA) and the probability of false negative (PFN) by examining the relationship between these probabilities and the detection thresholds. The results are summarized in Table II. To achieve a PFA of 0.05, the PFN is less than 0.3188, which is a relatively loose upper bound. In our experiment, we approximate the helper node using the node closest to the primary user, leading to an unnecessarily long distance between the primary user and the helper node. Consequently, the PFN in our experiment is larger than it needs to be. Notably, for k = 1, all PFNs are less than 0.0241, as the threshold range is quite narrow (between 0.6282 and 0.6816) when 0.05 ≤ PFA ≤ 0.2. Similarly, for k = 2, all PFNs are less than 0.0240.

**Table II: Trade-off Between PFA and PFN**

| PFA (k = 0, 1, 2) | PFN (k = 0) | PFN (k = 1) | PFN (k = 2) |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 0.05             | ≤ 0.3188     | ≤ 0.0241     | ≤ 0.0240     |
| 0.1              | ≤ 0.2319     | ≤ 0.0241     | ≤ 0.0240     |
| 0.15             | ≤ 0.1063     | ≤ 0.0241     | ≤ 0.0240     |
| 0.2              | ≤ 0.0821     | ≤ 0.0241     | ≤ 0.0240     |

### VIII. Implementation

To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach, we implemented a prototype using Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRPs) based on GNUradio [1]. Although USRPs may not fully replicate multipath properties due to low bandwidths, low power, and short-range communication, the prototype still demonstrates the feasibility of integrating cryptographic signatures and link signatures for authenticating primary users' signals in cognitive radio networks (CRNs).

**USRP and GNUradio Overview:**
- **USRP**: A radio frequency (RF) front end with analog-to-digital (AD) and digital-to-analog (DA) converters, capable of sampling rates up to 64 Mb/s (input) and 128 Mb/s (output).
- **GNUradio**: A software toolkit for implementing software-defined radios on external RF hardware and commodity processors.

**Experimental Setup:**
- **Hardware**: One USRP connected to a Lenovo X61 laptop (1.80 GHz Intel Core Duo CPU) and another USRP connected to a DELL machine (3.40 GHz Intel Pentium 4 CPU) via USB 2.0 links.
- **Software**: Both computers run Linux (Ubuntu 9.04) and GNUradio (version 3.2.2). The USRPs use XCVR2450 daughter boards as transceivers.
- **Applications**: Helper node and secondary user applications implemented using the GNUradio toolkit, installed on the laptop and DELL machine, respectively.

**Helper Node Application:**
- Generates signed packets using MD5 as the one-way function and RSA as the cryptographic signature algorithm.
- Modulates the signed packets into physical layer symbols using differential binary phase-shift keying (DBPSK).
- Filters the symbols through a pulse shape filter to convert them into baseband signals.
- Transmits the baseband signals to the USRP, which converts them into RF signals and sends them over the wireless channel.

**Secondary User Application:**
- Down-converts the received RF signal into a baseband signal.
- Demodulates the baseband signal using a DBPSK demodulator.
- Verifies the cryptographic signature and reconstructs the transmitted signal.
- Computes the 512-point complex Fourier transform (F1) of the baseband signal and the transmitted signal (F2).
- Calculates the link signature by multiplying F1 with the conjugate of F2 and performing an inverse Fourier transform.

**Experimental Parameters:**
- Packet length: 75 bytes
- Bit rate: 2 Mbit/s
- Carrier frequency: 5 GHz
- Transmitter and receiver positions: Initially 5 meters apart, then moved to 0.5 meters and 15 meters away from the original position.

**Results:**
- Measured link signatures show that the signatures at the old position and position a are mixed, while the signature at position b significantly deviates from the others, consistent with our analytical results (Figure 16).

**Computational Overhead:**
- We tested the computation time for generating and verifying signatures, computing Fourier transforms, and inverse Fourier transforms.
- The transmitter sends 1,000 packets every 0.1 seconds, and the computation times are recorded (Table III).

**Table III: Computation Time (Milliseconds)**

| Operations                | Time Range (ms) | Average (ms) |
|---------------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Signing                   | 0.1699 - 0.0239 | 0.0441       |
| Verification              | 0.4519 - 0.0781 | 0.1288       |
| Inverse Fourier Transform | 0.7310 - 0.2190 | 0.2920       |
| Fourier Transform         | 1.4000 - 0.4200 | 0.5612       |

### IX. Related Work

Primary user detection has been extensively studied, with traditional techniques including energy detection and feature detection. These methods can fail in hostile environments where attackers mimic primary user signals. Recent approaches, such as RSS-based location distinction, have limitations and require multi-node collaboration. Our work integrates cryptographic and wireless link signatures, achieving higher accuracy and addressing technical challenges in CRNs.

### X. Conclusion

In this paper, we developed a novel approach for authenticating primary users' signals in CRNs, conforming to FCC requirements. Our approach integrates cryptographic and wireless link signatures, using a helper node to enable secondary users to verify primary user signals. Theoretical analysis, experimental evaluation, and a prototype implementation on USRPs indicate that our approach is a promising solution for authenticating primary users' signals in CRNs.

### Appendix

In this appendix, we explain how we compute the link signature of the stored κ + 1 samples using the methodology proposed in [23].

Let \( r = [r(0), \ldots, r(\kappa T_r)] \) denote the samples of the received signal \( r(t) \), where \( T_r \) is the sampling rate. Based on the demodulation results, the secondary user can recreate the transmitted signal \( s(t) \). Let \( s = [s(0), \ldots, s(\kappa T_r)] \) denote the corresponding κ + 1 samples of the transmitted signal \( s(t) \).

Let \( R(iT_r) \) and \( S(iT_r) \) be the discrete Fourier transform of \( r(iT_r) \) and \( s(iT_r) \), respectively. According to [23], the link signature \( h = [h(0), \ldots, h(\kappa T_r)] \), which are the κ + 1 samples of \( h(t) \), can be calculated as:

\[
h(iT_r) = \frac{1}{P_s} F^{-1}(S^*(iT_r) R(iT_r)),
\]

where \( F^{-1}(·) \) denotes the inverse discrete Fourier transform, \( S^*(iT_r) \) is the complex conjugate of \( S(iT_r) \), and \( P_s = S^*(iT_r) \cdot S(iT_r) \).
