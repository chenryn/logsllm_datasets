### Title: Blackhat US-19: HTTP Desync Attacks: Smashing into the Cell Next Door

**Abstract:**

HTTP requests are traditionally viewed as isolated, standalone entities. In this session, I will introduce techniques that allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to break through this isolation and splice their requests into others. Using these methods, I have been able to manipulate the web infrastructure of numerous commercial and military systems, deliver exploits to their visitors, and earn over $50,000 in bug bounties.

**Session Overview:**

Through a series of case studies, I will demonstrate how to subtly alter victims' requests to redirect them to malicious endpoints, trigger harmful responses, and capture sensitive credentials. Additionally, I will show how backend reassembly can be used to exploit the trust placed on the frontend, gain maximum privilege access to internal APIs, poison web caches, and compromise even the most trusted login pages.

This type of attack is one for which the web is largely unprepared. Although documented over a decade ago, its reputation for complexity and potential collateral damage has led to it being largely ignored, allowing the web's vulnerability to grow. By applying fresh ideas and new techniques, I will reveal a vast landscape of vulnerable systems, ranging from large content delivery networks to custom backends.

To address this legacy, I will share a refined methodology and open-source tools for black-box detection, assessment, and exploitation, with minimal risk of collateral damage. These tools and techniques will be developed from core concepts, ensuring that you leave the session equipped to create your own desync techniques and tailor (or thwart) attacks against your target of choice.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Understand the mechanics of HTTP desync attacks.
- Learn how to detect and assess vulnerabilities in web systems.
- Gain practical knowledge on exploiting and mitigating desync attacks.
- Access to open-source tools and methodologies for secure web development.

Join me to explore the depths of this underappreciated but highly impactful attack vector.
