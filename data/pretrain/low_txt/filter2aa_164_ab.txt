# Introduction

Hello! I’m Tim Warner, and I am excited to guide you through the world of the Raspberry Pi. My goal is to get you excited about this $35, credit card-sized computer.

You might be wondering, "What can you do with a $35 computer?" Let's explore some popular Raspberry Pi projects:

- **Picade Arcade Cabinet (http://is.gd/i4YwQ2):** A tiny, fully-functional arcade machine.
- **Pi in the Sky (http://is.gd/4niEMV):** A camera-equipped Raspberry Pi sent into the upper atmosphere via a weather balloon.
- **Streaming Music Jukebox (http://is.gd/oqec3H):** An inexpensive wireless music broadcasting machine.
- **Raspberry Pi Keyboard Computer (http://is.gd/tvmgC8):** A full computer packed into the form factor of a keyboard.
- **DeviantArt Picture Frame (http://is.gd/i7ED9w):** An interactive frame that dynamically displays artwork from DeviantArt.
- **Pi-Powered Bitcoin Miner (http://is.gd/DrpJ7A):** A small rig for participating in Bitcoin mining.
- **FM Radio Transmitter (http://is.gd/tS52Yb):** A low-power, portable FM radio.
- **KindleBerry Pi (http://is.gd/73iVz4):** A Raspberry Pi using an Amazon Kindle as a monitor and terminal.

This book is filled with tasks that provide guided experience in setting up, configuring, troubleshooting, and building projects with your Raspberry Pi. I strongly suggest working through as many tasks as possible.

By the end of this book, you will not only be able to discuss the Raspberry Pi intelligently but also have a solid foundation in practical, applied computer science.

## Who Can Use This Book

- **Students and Teachers:** The Raspberry Pi was designed for educational purposes. Its open architecture and low price point make it an excellent platform for learning about computer hardware with minimal risk.
- **Hardware and Software Hackers:** Those who want to leverage the Pi to achieve personal or business goals, with or without additional hardware and software.
- **Tech Enthusiasts:** DIYers who prefer to build their own solutions or improve upon existing ones.

## How to Use This Book

I hope this book is easy to read, but a few elements are worth explaining:

- **URLs:** I use the is.gd URL shortening service to make long URLs more manageable. These URLs are case-sensitive, so ensure you type them exactly as shown.
- **Margin Notes:** The book contains special margin notes to highlight different types of information, such as tips, warnings, and important points.

Feel free to reach out if you have any feedback or questions. Happy hacking!
