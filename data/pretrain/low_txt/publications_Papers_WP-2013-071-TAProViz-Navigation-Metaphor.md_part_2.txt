**Table 1. The TAM-based survey students took (M = Median)**

The items in this survey were adapted from the original TAM article [4] and validated in a pilot study involving two researchers. The wording was adjusted to make the survey specific to process navigation. All items were measured using a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from "Strongly Disagree" (1) to "Strongly Agree" (7). One item was worded negatively to reduce response bias. The order of items was shuffled to minimize monotony.

### 3.2 Setup and Procedure

The subjects were students from the Department of Informatics Engineering at the University of Coimbra. Prior to the experiment, the students had completed a one-semester introductory course on Information Systems Management. In the final week of classes, they were asked to provide their opinions on the use of process navigation as a tool for managing process models in the future.

The concept of a process navigation system was introduced to the students using user interface (UI) mockups created with Microsoft PowerPoint. The experimenter administered the survey in class, showing four UI mockups (see Figure 3 for an example). Each mockup was presented on a separate slide, and the functionality of the system was explained. The entire explanation lasted approximately 10 minutes.

After ensuring that all participants understood the UI mockups, the experimenter briefly introduced the format of the survey and distributed it. The survey was identical for all subjects, and no textual descriptions of the mockups were provided. Once each subject received the survey, they were instructed to begin filling it out. The experimenter remained in the room throughout the experiment to ensure there was no collaboration among the subjects. Participants were free to leave once they finished, and all surveys were completed within 15 minutes. There were no time limits.

**Figure 3. Example of a mockup shown to subjects based on the prototype implemented (see Section 4).** The mockups included additional elements marked with a star, such as a bar showing KPIs, icons, and improved visual outlines of next steps.

### 3.3 Subject Characteristics

A total of 14 Master's degree students participated in the survey, which was conducted at the end of a 14-week semester. During the first four weeks of the semester, students were taught Business Process Management (BPM), including state diagrams, workflow nets, Petri nets, tasks, activities, cases, and control flow. For the remainder of the semester, ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) process models were also covered. By the time the survey was completed, students had a good understanding of BPM. The sample consisted of 7% female and 93% male students, aged between 22 and 26 years. All students were from the Computer Science department. No tests for color blindness or visual acuity were conducted.

### 3.4 Analysis and Findings

Prior to analyzing the survey, guidelines for screening missing data and outliers were followed. The 14 usable questionnaires were examined for missing data, and a few missing values were found. The mean of existing values was used to generate replacement values for the missing data. Given the small sample size, no further tests were conducted.

Descriptive statistics showed that subjects rated the process navigation approach highly in terms of PU, PEOU, ATU, and BI. The most common responses to these items were "I Strongly Agree," "I Agree," and "I Somewhat Agree." Table 1 shows the median of the answers. The results suggest that subjects agree with the usefulness and perceived ease of use of the metaphor, as the median for most questions was 6, indicating "I Agree." Subjects also had a positive attitude toward using a system implementing the metaphor and believed that if such a system existed, they would use it.

These insights into the navigation metaphor provide a good starting point for developing a prototype. However, this preliminary study needs to be replicated with a larger sample size to achieve greater statistical significance.

### 4. First Prototype

The primary objective of the prototype was to further study how mobile workers perceive a navigation system for processes. While the TAM survey results were influenced by the interpretation of the navigation metaphor, the prototype allows for a more direct study of the metaphor's perception. For example, we can visualize arbitrary cases for process workers on their Android devices (see Figure 3) and observe their reactions. Additionally, we can show or hide context information, such as data availability or current 'traffic,' and investigate the effects of its presence or absence on mobile workers. Different scenarios can be specified using a desktop application and sent on demand to connected Android front-ends. Consequently, all front-ends report user reactions (e.g., a direction sign was touched) back to the desktop application. However, since we initially wanted to explore the effects of applying the navigation metaphor to process management on mobile devices, the desktop controller application does not yet include a workflow engine that automatically derives the next situation. Instead, the simulation is manually controlled, and situations can be defined dynamically or loaded from configuration files.

**Figure 4. Basic steps of the simulation as implemented by the prototype.** The process begins with the launch of the controller application on a PC, which must be connected to the same network as the mobile devices or reachable via its IP address. The simulation front-end is then started on Android-powered mobile devices. Upon starting, the front-end establishes a connection to the controller. The simulation supervisor can load a specific workflow case, update it, and transmit it to connected front-ends. If a new situation is needed, the supervisor can create it using the controller application. It is important to note that the controller is not intended for process modeling but allows for creating single tasks with a graphical user interface.

Upon receiving a specific case, the front-ends set up the corresponding visualization. Subjects can examine it, interpret the labels and descriptions, and decide what to do next by interacting with their device (e.g., touching a label). This decision is sent back to the controller and visualized for the supervisor, who then switches to the next situation in the workflow.

Even though the architecture and basic simulation process were implemented simply, they allow for studying important results relevant to the interaction of agents in a distributed, mobile workflow execution environment. First, the prototype demonstrates our concept of visualizing a workflow instance using the navigation metaphor. It has limited flexibility, providing a detailed view of a specific case but not an overview of the entire process instance. Second, it highlights the need to consider the interaction between concurrently acting workflow agents more closely. Although agent selection and notification are standard features in modern workflow management systems, the mobile scenario adds complexity, as agents may be temporarily disconnected from a central server. Work may start and finish without notifying the server. Lastly, the front-end only provides task information to users; real data is not yet transmitted. Therefore, the controller receives notifications about task selections but no updates on the status of data or other workflow resources.

### 5. Related Work

The applicability of the car navigation metaphor to workflow systems was first discussed in [12]. Our work takes this a step further by exploring how it can guide the development of mobile workflow solutions.

Hipp et al. [7] suggested navigating through large process models using Google Earth. Unlike our work, their navigation is static and does not visualize process instances. Their approach treats large processes as maps and adds zooming functionalities. Effinger [5] developed a 3D Flight Navigator for visualizing process models. While the idea is interesting, it primarily enables 3D representation of models, and the benefits of a 3D view, except for hierarchical visualization of subprocesses, are unclear. Poppe et al. [11] constructed a prototype for remote collaborative process modeling using virtual environments. Their system relies on Second Life, a head-mounted display, and enables BPMN modeling. Although their work contrasts with ours, as we focus on navigating process models and instances, their findings are relevant, as preliminary data indicates that users interact well with virtual environments. Vankipuram et al. [14] used virtual world replay to visualize critical care environments. Our approach is distinct, as we target metaphors with high user acceptance for navigation on mobile devices.

Hackmann et al. [6] presented a BPEL execution engine (Sliver) that supports a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop PCs. Their work demonstrated that mobile devices can host sophisticated workflow/groupware applications. Leoni and Mecella [10] described a distributed workflow management system for mobile devices (Windows Mobile platform) using BPEL for execution logic. Their application follows traditional task list behavior, providing a screen for managing assigned tasks.

### 6. Conclusion

Research indicates that new workflow paradigms for mobile devices can be inspired by the TomTom metaphor. We have established an isomorphism between navigation and workflow systems, aggregating mappings in three categories: (1) topology of route networks, (2) connectivity of maps, and (3) landmarks. An acceptance evaluation determined that end-users would likely use a workflow system implementing a car navigation metaphor. Encouraging results led to the implementation of a first prototype. We believe that the isomorphism will enable users to apply their driving knowledge to workflow management, facilitating the navigation of process models and instances. Future work will focus on implementing additional features and conducting a more comprehensive system evaluation.
