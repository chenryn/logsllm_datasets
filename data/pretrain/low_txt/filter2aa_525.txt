# Presentation: Hack Any Website
**Defcon 11 – 2003 Edition - Alexis Park, Las Vegas, USA**
**Presenter: Grégoire Gentil, CEO and CTO of Twingo Systems**
**Date: August 2, 2003**

**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL**

## Agenda
- Overview of the Attack
- Demos
- General Analysis
- Technical Analysis
- How to Defend?
- Conclusion
- Questions and Answers

---

### What Can You Do When You Want to Steal Money?
- **Option 1:** Attack the bank directly.
  - *Caveat:* Security can be very robust.
- **Option 2:** Attack the bank's customers.
  - This approach is often more effective due to weaker individual security.

### What Can You Do When You Want to Hack a Website?
- **Option 1:** Attack the server.
  - *Caveat:* Security measures like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-virus software can make this difficult.
- **Option 2:** Attack the clients.
  - This is the focus of today's presentation.

---

### Demos
- **Demo 1:** Dynamic modification of the content of a webpage.
  - Example: Modify the homepage of a media website.
- **Demo 2:** Dynamic modification of the JavaScript on a webpage.
  - Example: Alter the features of the list view in a webmail service.

---

### Scope of the Security Vulnerability
- **Requirements:**
  - Internet Explorer 4.0 and Windows 95 or later.
  - DLL registration via an executable run once with "Power user" privileges.
- **Context:**
  - Over 90% of Google requests come from Windows-Internet Explorer, as per Google Zeitgeist.
  - Many privilege escalation and code execution vulnerabilities have been discovered, allowing attacks without user intervention.
- **Implications:**
  - The attack is highly generic and can lead to numerous malicious scenarios.

---

### Advantages of the Attack
- No modifications required on the targeted server.
- Utilizes a feature developed and supported by Microsoft.
- The installed DLL is undetectable by anti-virus software.
- The attack can be personalized for specific clients or targeted at a single client.

### Introducing Browser Helper Objects (BHOs)
- **Implementation:**
  - As COM in-process DLLs loaded by Internet Explorer.
  - Initialized by the browser, which passes its IUnknown pointer to the BHO.
  - Also implemented in Windows Explorer.
  - Refer to Dino Esposito's article “Browser Helper Objects: The Browser the Way You Want It” in MSDN for more details.

### Accessing the Interface of the Browser
- **IObjectWithSite Interface:**
  - `HRESULT SetSite(IUnknown* pUnkSite)`
    - Receives the IUnknown pointer of the browser and stores it for future use.
- **IConnectionPoint Interface:**
  - `HRESULT Connect(void)`
    - Connects to the browser via an IConnectionPoint interface to intercept events.
- **Event Handling:**
  - `STDMETHODIMP Invoke(DISPID dispidMember, REFIID riid, LCID lcid, WORD wFlags, DISPPARAMS* pDispParams, VARIANT* pvarResult, EXCEPINFO* pExcepInfo, UINT* puArgErr)`
    - Handles specific events, such as `DISPID_DOCUMENTCOMPLETE`, to access and modify the document object.

### Registering and Installing the Component
- **Steps:**
  - Register the DLL using `regsvr32.exe myBHO.dll`.
  - Create a key in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Browser Helper Objects` with the GUID of the component.
  - The next instance of Internet Explorer will automatically load the BHO.

---

### Possible Defenses
- **Disable BHOs:**
  - Enumerate and analyze BHOs from the registry.
  - Main drawback: BHOs can be useful, such as the Acrobat plug-in and Google toolbar.
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Microsoft could enhance BHO support in future versions of Internet Explorer.
  - Implement tags to disable BHOs for specific web pages.
  - Develop an authentication system to disable non-approved BHOs.

---

### Conclusion
- The attack can be selective and personalized.
- Users should not trust what they see, especially on untrusted computers.
- Regularly check BHOs installed on your computer using tools like BHOWatcher.
