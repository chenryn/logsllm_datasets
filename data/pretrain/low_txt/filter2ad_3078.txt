## Abstract
We present a machine learning-augmented Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing system that infers Shared Risk Groups (SRGs) from link failure history. For an initial link failure matching an SRG, it predicts subsequent Link State Advertisements (LSAs) corresponding to that SRG, thereby improving convergence and recovery times during multiple network failures.

## 1. Introduction
As part of the Future Internet Research and Experimentation (FIRE) initiative within the European Seventh Framework Programme, the ECODE (Experimental COgnitive Distributed Engine) project [1] designs, evaluates, and experiments with cognitive routing system functionality using online distributed machine learning techniques.

In this demonstration, we consider concurrent failures under the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF [2]) link state routing protocol. We developed and implemented a Machine Learning Engine (MLE) that clusters and data-mines multiple network failures from locally received OSPF routing information sequences. The MLE predicts LSAs for future concurrent failures and coordinates with OSPF to speed up convergence and connectivity recovery. The MLE is integrated into the router architecture as part of the control plane (Fig. 1). This experiment uses the ECODE cognitive routing platform, based on the eXtensible Open Routing Platform (XORP) [3].

## 2. SRG Inference
Layered networks often suffer from concurrent upper-layer failures of multiple links (the shared risk group or SRG) caused by the failure of a single lower-layer resource. While SRG information might seem derivable from the current network configuration, in reality, IP link topology is often constructed on top of different network layers and domains. For example, IP links may be carried over optical channels provided by different operators leasing fibers in the same physical duct, making SRG disjointness a challenging problem. Additionally, simultaneous failures can trigger multiple successive routing table recomputations.

In this work, machine learning is used to identify and predict SRGs from statistical information embedded in LSAs, without prior knowledge of SRGs. The XORP OSPF module's process flow between LSA reception and routing table recomputation was modified to allow interaction with the MLE module (Fig. 2).

## 3. Demonstration
SRG inference is demonstrated in an emulated OSPF area augmented with the machine learning component. The setup visualizes network connectivity by displaying a graph model of the network and SRG information on one screen (Fig. 3). A second screen shows the output of several video streams transported over the network, allowing spectators to verify the impact of multiple link failures on network connectivity. We compare standard OSPF, which offers slow, piecewise recovery of connectivity, with SRG inference-augmented OSPF, which reroutes and recovers all links in an entire SRG simultaneously. A video of the demonstration is available [6].

## 4. Results
Figure 4 shows packet traces obtained when applying the proposed technique to recover three video streams. The streams are routed over different paths, visiting a set of spread-out links in two SRGs. Recovery times for normal OSPF (top three traces) and SRG inference-augmented OSPF (bottom three traces) are shown. Initially, both SRGs are failed and recovered once, allowing the SRG inference algorithm to learn their existence. Both cases show normal OSPF reconvergence, with the three streams recovering one by one as the failures in each path's links are detected. Note that the SRG2 link corresponding to end-to-end connectivity for stream 1 is detected locally through a hardware alarm, yielding faster detection than the Hello protocol-based neighbor discovery seen for the other streams. When the SRGs are failed again, the SRG inference scenario shows simultaneous recovery of the streams as the first LSA arrives. When one of the failing links in an SRG is detected locally, all SRG links and thus all streams benefit from this fast detection, allowing for sub-25 ms recovery in the demonstration setup.
