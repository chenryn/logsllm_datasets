As systems become increasingly interconnected with a diverse range of other systems and environments, architects will find it more challenging to meticulously plan interactions among system components. This is because an increasing number of these interactions will involve foreign and potentially unanticipated systems or components. Consequently, humans will be less capable of installing, configuring, optimizing, maintaining, and integrating large, complex, and heterogeneous computing systems. They will also struggle to respond quickly and decisively to a rapidly changing and often conflicting set of demands.

To address these significant challenges, systems need to be designed to be self-managing. Self-managing systems automate all phases of the lifecycle of complex computing systems, from installation to runtime maintenance and optimization. This workshop will provide a forum for a select group of participants to explore new paradigms, system designs, and algorithms for self-managing computing systems.

We invite papers on topics including, but not limited to:
- Self-managing storage, peer-to-peer architectures, and grid architectures
- Economic models for self-management
- Biological models for self-management
- Self-managing transaction systems
- Adaptation to human errors
- Limits and dangers of relying on self-managing systems
- Decision algorithms
- Data mining, statistics, and other analytic techniques

Workshop attendance is open to all attendees registered for DSN-2003. We welcome participation from professionals with diverse backgrounds who can contribute to advancing the technology and understanding of the workshop's subject.
