### Network Activity and Power Consumption Analysis

#### Network Activity
- **Bytes in/out per Client (Figure 7a)**: This figure shows the number of bytes sent and received by a single client when sending a whisper message to a varying group size. The x-axis represents the group size, and the y-axis represents the number of bytes.
- **Incoming Bandwidth (Figure 7b)**: This figure illustrates the incoming bandwidth at the server as the number of bytes received per second.
- **Outgoing Bandwidth (Figure 7c)**: This figure illustrates the outgoing bandwidth at the server as the number of bytes sent per second.

**Observations**:
- Increasing the group size does not significantly increase the number of received bytes compared to a group with only two members. This indicates that the overhead increase due to recipient group size is minimal compared to the SSL connection overhead.
- The Twitsper server sends a confirmation to the user, making the bytes out independent of the recipient group size. In contrast, the TCM server must send whispers to each recipient, leading to a higher number of Direct Messages and increased SSL connection overhead.

#### Power Consumption
- **Comparison of Power Consumption (Figure 8)**: This figure compares the power consumption of Twitsper and a popular Twitter client (TweetCaster) during a single message send and home screen refresh.
- **Total Energy Consumption (Figure 9)**: This figure breaks down the total energy consumption (in mJ) for different components (interface, LCD, CPU, 3G, and other).
- **Client Energy Consumption (Figure 10)**: This figure shows the energy consumption per day on an Android phone for an average Twitter user who sends 10 messages per day and has 200 followers.

**Observations**:
- Twitsper offers higher CPU utilization and lower bandwidth requirements but consumes more energy than the TCM client, especially when the fraction of private messages (f) is large or group sizes are big.
- Despite this, the energy consumption overhead with Twitsper is minimal for small groups and a small fraction of private messages. The energy consumed per client ranges from 1.9 J to 2.5 J, which is less than 0.005% of the energy capacity of typical batteries (10 KJ).
- The majority of the energy consumed is by the user's interaction with the phone's display, rather than the message sending process itself.

### Conclusions
- **Privacy Controls**: For users of popular OSNs, improved privacy controls can be achieved without explicit support from the OSN provider. Twitsper demonstrates that it is possible to offer fine-grained private group messaging on Twitter while preserving Twitter’s commercial interests.
- **Future Work**: We plan to implement similar fine-grained privacy controls on other OSNs like Facebook and Google+ using their APIs. The positive feedback received for Twitsper suggests that its adoption and follow-ons may persuade OSN providers to offer better privacy controls to their users.
