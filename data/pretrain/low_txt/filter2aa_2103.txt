# The Core Problem with Authentication and How to Overcome It

## Author: Jason M. Pittman

### Introduction
In this discussion, we will delve deeply into the philosophical underpinnings of authentication, particularly focusing on modern password-based systems. We will explore the theoretical flaws in current authentication methods, examine future possibilities, and propose a new approach to address these issues.

### Modern Authentication
#### Current State
- **Authentication Methods**:
  - **Something you know** (e.g., passwords)
  - **Something you have** (e.g., tokens)
  - **Something you are** (e.g., biometrics)
  - **Combinations** (e.g., two-factor authentication)

- **Password Usage**:
  - **High Penetration**: Passwords are the most common form of authentication.
  - **User Base**: A significant portion of the digital population uses passwords.
  - **Historical Context**:
    - **1961**: MIT CTSS introduced the first computer password.
    - **1978**: Morris invented crypt(3), enhancing password security.
    - **Key Trends**:
      - Transition from single-user systems to networked operating systems.
      - Web 2.0 and the Digital Era led to an explosion in authentication needs.

- **User Behavior**:
  - **Multiple Passwords**: Many users manage multiple passwords.
  - **Survey Data** (SafeNet/Rainbow Technologies, 2003):
    - 1-2 passwords: 17.7%
    - 3-4 passwords: 34.4%
    - 5-6 passwords: 18.4%
    - 7-8 passwords: 5.6%
    - 8 or more: 23.9%

- **Usage Patterns** (Florencio & Herley, 2007):
  - Users type a password approximately 8 times a day.
  - Users typically retain about 6.5 passwords.
  - Each password is shared across 3-4 accounts.

- **Pittman’s Law of Passwords**:
  - The number of passwords per user roughly doubles every four years.

### Failures and Threats
- **User Dissatisfaction**:
  - 80% of users prefer alternatives to passwords (Infosecurity Europe Survey, April 2004).

- **Perceived Threats** (TriCipher Survey, July 2005):
  - Keyloggers (35%)
  - Password Sharing (26%)
  - Phishing (12%)

- **Security Breaches**:
  - Over 43% of security breaches are related to authentication (Camelot Network Security & Privacy Study, June 2001).
  - Approximately 60% of attacks involve authentication (The State of IT Security, July 2003).

- **Recent Compromises**:
  - HBGary, RSA, InfraGard, and others have experienced breaches starting from or resulting in the disclosure of authentication data.

### The Fundamental Problem
- **Indirect Identity Assertion**:
  - Current authentication methods, including passwords, rely on indirect forms of identity assertion.
  - Software makes the identity assertion on behalf of the user, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

- **Cognitive and Visual Alternatives**:
  - Cognitive passwords (Allendoerfer & Pai, 2005)
  - Proactive passwords (Vu et al., 2007)
  - Visual/Graphical passwords (Renaud & De Angeli, 2009)

- **Biometrics**:
  - Biometric systems still often rely on software middlemen, which can be exploited by threats like keyloggers.

- **Philosophical Flaw**:
  - Authentication was an afterthought in system design.
  - The essential model has expanded without addressing the core issue.
  - Blaming users for poor practices does not solve the underlying problem.

### Future of Authentication
#### Long-Term Vision
- **Thinking Ahead**:
  - Consider the next 20, 30, or 40 years.
  - Exponential growth in technology (Kurzweil and Vinge).

- **Transhumanism**:
  - **Full Transhumanism**:
    - Immersive nanotech, machine housing, sentient machines.
  - **Partial Transhumanism**:
    - Semi-sentient machines, genetically engineered materials, non-immersive nanotech.

- **Direct Assertion Authentication**:
  - Remove the middleware and create a direct interface between humans and computing systems.
  - Examples from popular culture:
    - **The Matrix**: Direct neural interfacing and visual authentication.
    - **Surrogates**: Bio-physiological interfaces and visual authentication between avatars.

- **Technological Feasibility**:
  - Companies like Intendix and Emotiv are already developing technologies for direct brain-computer interfaces.
  - Future research should focus on creating systems that accept direct assertions of identity.

- **Potential Threats**:
  - New types of keyloggers that capture bioinformation.
  - Exploitation of biological vulnerabilities.
  - Malware that mimics and exploits these new interfaces.

### Conclusion
- **Research Questions**:
  - Why is modern authentication flawed?
  - Why aren’t researchers addressing these issues?

- **Research Goals**:
  - Develop a theoretical approach for future authentication.
  - Address the fundamental flaw in current authentication design.
  - Ensure that the new approach is secure and user-friendly.
