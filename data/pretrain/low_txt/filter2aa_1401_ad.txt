### Chapter 2: Setting Up Share Points

#### Setting Up a Drop Box
A drop box is a shared folder with specific permissions, allowing anyone to copy files into it, but only the owner can read or access those files.

**Note:** Drop boxes should only be created within AFP (Apple Filing Protocol) share points. AFP is the only protocol that automatically changes the ownership of any file placed in the drop box to match the owner of the drop box. For other protocols, the file's original ownership remains unchanged, even if the original owner no longer has access to the file once it is inside the drop box.

**Steps to Create a Drop Box:**
1. **Create the Folder:**
   - Within an AFP share point, create the folder that will serve as the drop box.
   
2. **Configure Permissions:**
   - Open Workgroup Manager and navigate to the "Sharing" section.
   - Select the "Share Points" tab and choose the folder you created in the AFP share point.
   - Click on "General."
   - Set "Write Only" privileges for users who can copy items into the drop box.
     - To create a drop box for a specific group of users, enter the group name (or drag the group from the "Users & Groups" drawer) and select "Write Only" privileges from the "Group" pop-up menu.
     - To create a drop box accessible to everyone, select "Write Only" privileges from the "Everyone" pop-up menu. For enhanced security, it is recommended not to allow access to everyoneâ€”set "None" for the "Everyone" privileges.
   - Click "Save."

**From the Command Line:**
- You can also set up a drop box using the `mkdir` and `chmod` commands in Terminal. Refer to the "file services" chapter in the command-line administration guide for more details.

### Using Workgroup Manager with Mac OS X Server Version 10.1.5
Workgroup Manager is available only on Mac OS X Server version 10.2 or later. If you need to use Workgroup Manager to edit account information on a Mac OS X Server version 10.1.5, you must remotely access that server from a computer running Mac OS X Server version 10.2 and log in as a root user.

**To Log In to a Remote Server as a Root User with Workgroup Manager:**
1. **Select the Domain:**
   - In Workgroup Manager, choose the shared domain of interest from the domain pop-up list below the toolbar.
   - Alternatively, you can select "View Directories" from the "Server" menu.
   
2. **Log In:**
   - Use a root user name and password to log in.
   - If you are not logged in as a root user, you cannot make changes using Workgroup Manager.

**Recommendation:**
- It is advisable to upgrade servers on your network to use Mac OS X Server version 10.2 or later for better compatibility and functionality.

### Chapter 3: AFP Service

This chapter provides instructions on setting up and managing AFP (Apple Filing Protocol) service in Mac OS X Server.

#### General Information
AFP service allows Macintosh clients to connect to your server and access folders and files as if they were located on their own computers. AFP service uses version 3.1 of AFP, which supports features such as Unicode file names and 64-bit file sizes. Unicode assigns a unique number to every character, regardless of language or operating system.

#### Kerberos Authentication
AFP service supports Kerberos authentication, a network authentication protocol developed at MIT to provide secure authentication and communication over open networks. In addition to the standard authentication method, Mac OS X Server utilizes GSSAPI (Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface) to support Kerberos v.5. You can specify the authentication method using the Access pane of AFP service settings. For more information on setting up Kerberos, refer to the Open Directory administration guide.

#### Automatic Reconnect
Mac OS X Server can automatically reconnect idle or sleeping Mac OS X clients. When clients become idle or go to sleep, the server disconnects them to free up resources. However, the server can save client sessions, allowing them to resume work on open files without data loss. Configure this setting in the Idle Users pane of the AFP service configuration window.

#### Find by Content
Mac OS X clients can use Sherlock to search the contents of AFP servers. This feature enforces privileges, ensuring that only files to which the user has access are searched.

#### AppleTalk Support
The new Apple file service no longer supports AppleTalk as a client connection method. While Mac OS X Server advertises its services over AppleTalk, clients using AppleTalk must connect to the server via TCP/IP. Refer to the sections on "Mac OS X Clients" and "Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9 Clients" for more details.

#### Apple File Service Specifications
- **Maximum number of connected users:** Unlimited (hardware dependent)
- **Maximum volume size:** 2 terabytes
- **TCP port number:** 548
- **Log file location:** `/Library/Logs/AppleFileService`
- **Rendezvous registration type:** afpserver

#### Setting Up AFP Service
If you allowed the Server Assistant to start AFP service during the installation of Mac OS X Server, no further action is required. However, you should verify that the default service settings meet your needs. The following sections guide you through configuring the Apple file service settings.

**Configuration Steps:**
- **General Settings:** Set information that identifies your server, enable automatic startup, and create a login message for AFP service.
- **Access Settings:** Set up client connections and guest access.
- **Logging Settings:** Configure and manage logs for AFP service.
- **Idle Users Settings:** Configure and administer idle user settings.

**Starting AFP Service:**
- Open Server Admin and select AFP in the Computers & Services list.
- Click "Start Service" to make AFP share points available to your client users.

**Managing AFP Service:**
- **Checking Service Status:** Use Server Admin to view the status of AFP service, including whether it is running, throughput, number of connections, and whether guest access is enabled.
- **Viewing Service Logs:** Use Server Admin to view the error and access logs for AFP service.
- **Stopping AFP Service:** Important: Stopping AFP service may cause connected users to lose unsaved changes in open files. Follow the steps to stop the service after warning users.
- **Enabling NSL and Rendezvous Browsing:** Register the service with Network Service Locator (NSL) and Rendezvous to allow users to find the server by browsing.
- **Enabling AppleTalk Browsing:** Enable browsing with AppleTalk to allow Mac OS 8 and 9 users to see your servers and other network resources.
- **Limiting Connections:** Set the maximum number of client and guest connections to prevent performance issues.
- **Keeping an Access Log:** Set up access logging to record when users connect, disconnect, open, create, or delete files and folders.

**From the Command Line:**
- You can also configure and manage AFP service settings using the `serveradmin` command in Terminal. Refer to the "file services" chapter in the command-line administration guide for more information.
