### USDL Models and Service-Consumer Mapping

USDL (Unified Service Description Language) models are mapped into services, denoted as \( S(t) \), and consumers, denoted as \( C(t) \). Each service system's USDL model includes a value proposition communicated to customers. This value proposition encompasses the attractive elements or preferential attachments that make the service appealing.

The perceived value of a service is determined from the consumer's perspective, as they compare it with alternative services. For simplicity, we assume that the value proposition is uniform across all service systems and is based on the service price, calculated using a `usdl-price:PricePlan3`.

### Market Share Calculation and Evolution

To forecast the evolution of a service network over time, we use the following function to calculate the market share of each service:

\[ \text{MS}(s_i) = \frac{\text{degree}(s_i)}{m} \]

where:
- \(\text{degree}(s_i)\) is the number of relationships established by service \( s_i \) with service consumers.
- \( m \) is the total number of relationships established between providers and consumers.

Over time, customer preferences may change, leading them to switch from one service system to another. To monitor these changes in an Open Semantic Service Network (OSSN), OSSR (Open Semantic Service Relationship) data need to be regularly accessed and retrieved. Since OSSR have a validity timestamp, optimization mechanisms can be implemented to reduce traffic and enhance algorithm efficiency.

### Market Share Evolution Over Time

Figure 3 illustrates the market share evolution over time. Assuming the (re)constructed SN topology shows the market share at \( t = 3 \) as depicted in Figure 3, the question is: What will happen to the market in the future if the conditions remain unchanged (i.e., the value propositions of \( s_i \) stay the same and \( m \geq c \))?

According to the Bass model [26], the leading service system will reach a fixed-point market share given by:

\[ \text{MS}(s_i, t) = \frac{1 - e^{-bt}}{1 + ae^{-bt}}, \quad 0 \leq t \leq 9 \]

where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants.

Figure 3 shows that out of four provided services, three initially increase in market share, reach a peak, and then decline as the leading service accelerates due to the preferential attachment effect. Eventually, all but one service leave the market, resulting in a monopoly. Such forecasts are crucial for regulatory bodies like the European Commission, which aim to prevent monopolistic markets.

### Analytical Analysis of OSSN

In our second evaluation, we explored the suitability of dynamic OSSN for modeling system dynamics. Instead of analyzing causes and effects in isolation, we consider service networks as systems composed of interacting parts (see Section 6).

Once an OSSN is created from distributed service models, cause-effect diagrams can be derived for the network. For example, Figure 4 shows service systems \( S_i \), \( S_j \), and \( S_k \), with directed edges illustrating internal and external relationships.

#### Tragedy of the Commons Archetype

Causal relationships connect KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) from different services and within services. The pattern represented by this OSSN is known as the "Tragedy of the Commons" archetype. It hypothesizes that if two services \( S_i \) and \( S_j \) overuse the common/shared service \( S_k \), it will become overloaded or depleted, leading to diminishing benefits for all providers.

To increase net gains, both providers increase the availability of service instances. As the number of instances increases, the margin decreases, necessitating even more instances. This increased stress on the availability of service \( S_k \) can lead to its collapse or inability to respond as needed. Consequently, services \( S_i \) and \( S_j \) can no longer fully operate, and the net gain is significantly reduced for all parties involved, as shown in Figure 4.b).

#### Stock and Flow Diagrams and Causal Loop Diagrams

To better understand the dynamics and structure of the service network, stock and flow diagrams and causal loop diagrams should be considered. These provide the basis for quantifying and simulating the behavior of the service network over time. For a detailed description of dynamic systems and their representation, see [9].

While further evaluation is needed, the initial results show that the proposed extensions to USDL and OSSR provide the necessary mechanisms for conducting an analytical analysis of dynamic OSSN.

### Conclusions and Future Work

Network science has contributed significantly to social networks and the World Wide Web, but the concept of service networks is relatively new and presents unique challenges. They are large-scale, open, dynamic, highly distributed, and aim to model worldwide service-based economies. In this paper, we used General System Theory to identify requirements for developing dynamic OSSN, an important extension to static OSSN.

We adapted USDL and OSSR to enable the representation of dynamic service networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these extensions, we evaluated their applicability for evolutionary and analytical analysis of dynamic OSSN. The results are promising, as they constitute the first steps towards developing algorithms to simulate and understand service-based economies.

For future work, we plan to complement the analysis of GST with the Viable System Model (VSM) proposed by Stafford Beer, to provide an additional theoretical conceptualization for OSSN. We also plan to conduct a more comprehensive validation by creating a working example to illustrate the applicability of the OSSN model and apply it in a case study with primary data. Action research will provide the foundations for validation and establishing a warranted belief that the OSSN model can contribute to the understanding, analysis, and design of service systems.
