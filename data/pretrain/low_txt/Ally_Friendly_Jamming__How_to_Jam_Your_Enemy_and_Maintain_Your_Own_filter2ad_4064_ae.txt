### Predicting and Removing Ally Jamming Signals

To predict the ally jamming signals in the received samples, we first estimate these signals and then subtract them from the received samples. This process allows us to determine the remaining ally jamming power. The percentage of jamming power removed by the authorized receiver depends on the number of ally jamming samples used for estimation. Intuitively, as the channel changes over time, using the same estimated channel coefficients for too many samples degrades the quality of the estimation, resulting in less jamming power being removed.

Figure 14 illustrates that the authorized device can remove between 99.2% and 99.6% of the ally jamming power when the length of the estimated samples increases from 1,000 to 14,000. In other words, the vast majority of the ally jamming signal power can be effectively removed.

### Macro-Evaluation

In this section, we use the TX On Samples. We adjust the transmitter's gain and the ally jammers' gains to achieve different JSRs (Jamming Signal Ratios). The authorized receiver first detects the transmissions, recovers the transmitted signals, and then streams them into the demodulation blocks. In contrast, the unauthorized receiver demodulates the received samples directly.

**Figure 15: Macro-evaluation.**

**BER (%)**

As the JSR increases, the BER of the unauthorized receiver quickly rises to about 50%, which is comparable to random guessing. In contrast, with the ally jamming signal removal techniques, the authorized receiver maintains a BER close to 0 until the JSR exceeds 17 dB.

When the JSR increases, the packet loss rate at the unauthorized receiver quickly reaches 100%, while the packet loss rate at the authorized receiver remains close to 0 until the JSR reaches 16 dB. Unauthorized devices can attempt to use Error Correction Code (ECC) to tolerate errors, but with a BER close to 50%, it is unlikely to significantly reduce the packet loss rate.

### Preliminary Evaluation of Ally Friendly Jamming

We also conducted a preliminary evaluation of ally friendly jamming against unauthorized devices equipped with DSSS-based anti-jamming capability. In this experiment, we used the IEEE 802.11b protocol running at 1 Mbps on unauthorized devices, which uses DSSS with an 11-bit Barker code for spreading and despreading [29]. Specifically, we used two laptops with 802.11b wireless adapters operating in DSSS mode as unauthorized devices and another laptop connected to a USRP N210 board as the ally jammer. All three devices were approximately 2 meters apart. We set the USRP to 2.452 GHz and the 802.11b wireless adapters to the same frequency (channel 9). We adjusted the ally jammer's gain to match the transmit power of the 802.11b transmitter. We tested the packet loss rate at the 802.11b receiver side for different jamming symbol rates. (Note that higher symbol rates cover a wider spectrum.)

**Figure 16: Jamming DSSS devices (ksps: kilo symbols per second).**

- **Symbol Rate of Ally Jammer (ksps)**
  - 0
  - 100
  - 200
  - 300
  - 400
  - 500
  - 600
  - 700
  - 800
  - 900
  - 1,000
  - 1,100

- **Packet Loss Rate (%)**
  - 100
  - 80
  - 60
  - 40
  - 20
  - 0

Figure 16 shows that when the symbol rate for the ally jammer exceeds 600 ksps, communication between the 802.11b DSSS devices is disabled. Note that although the 802.11b DSSS mode is designed for wireless communication under interference, it is not intended as a strong anti-jamming solution. Further in-depth evaluation is necessary to understand the performance of ally friendly jamming against powerful anti-jamming communication schemes.

### Related Work

**IMD Shield [12]** is the most closely related work to ours. As discussed in the introduction, IMD Shield cannot achieve ally friendly jamming. We do not repeat it here.

Our work is generally related to research on interference cancellation and suppression. Zigzag recursively applies interference cancellation to obtain interference-free signals from colliding ones [13]. Another Interference Alignment and Cancellation (IAC) technique was proposed to enable collaborative Access Points (APs) in MIMO LANs to decode more packets by controlling transmitted signals with proper vectors [14]. 802.11n+ was proposed to use "antidote" signals to nullify the transmitted signals from other nodes to enable multiple access to wireless channels [19]. An implementation of successive interference cancellation (SIC) for ZigBee on software radios was presented in [15], which can decode concurrently transmitted packets. Moreover, SAM [41] provides a chain-decoding technique to decode concurrent frames. All these techniques assume regular modulated signals are transmitted and perform interference cancellation accordingly. Unfortunately, when the ally jamming signals mimic random noise, none of them can be used due to challenges in synchronization and channel estimation. Our proposed techniques address these issues and advance interference cancellation techniques to the next level.

Ally friendly jamming is also related to wireless jamming and anti-jamming research. For friendly jamming studies, Sankararaman et al. studied strategies for allocating friendly jammers to create wireless barriers to prevent eavesdropping [36]. Other literature (e.g., [27], [35], [44]) uses friendly jamming to block responses or unauthorized queries to protect particular wireless devices. For jamming and anti-jamming techniques, jamming attack models and several ways to detect jamming attacks have been studied in [45]. Game-theoretic models have been developed for jamming and jamming defense [37], [46]. Spread spectrum techniques such as DSSS and FHSS have traditionally been used for anti-jamming wireless communication. In recent years, researchers have identified some weaknesses of such schemes due to shared keys and developed enhanced schemes, including Uncoordinated FHSS and its variations (e.g., [20], [38]–[40]), Uncoordinated DSSS and its variations (e.g., [21], [24], [32], [33]), and novel coding techniques (e.g., [5], [42]). Several filter design jamming mitigation techniques have also been proposed [8], [9]. All these works are complementary to our results in this paper.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we presented ally friendly jamming, a mechanism that jams unauthorized wireless communication while maintaining legitimate communication. Ally friendly jamming is achieved by properly controlling the ally jamming signals using secret keys shared among authorized devices and the ally jammers. We analyzed the properties of ally friendly jamming, implemented a prototype system, and performed a series of experimental evaluations. Our results demonstrated that the proposed techniques can effectively disable unauthorized wireless communication and allow wireless communication between authorized devices.

Future work includes enhancing the robustness of the ally friendly jamming technique, investigating its capability against unauthorized anti-jamming devices, and defending against adversarial jamming attacks.
