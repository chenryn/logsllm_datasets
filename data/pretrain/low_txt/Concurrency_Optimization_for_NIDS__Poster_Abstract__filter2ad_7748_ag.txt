**Title:** No Transporters, No Transport: Assessing the 'Real' (Natural) Substrates of Xenobiotic Transporters
**Presenting Author:** Douglas Kell, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom
**Co-Author:** Steve O’Hagan

**Abstract:**
Contrary to textbook assertions, bilayer flux through intact cell membranes is negligible, and hydrophobicity is often a poor indicator of permeability. The natural substrates of xenobiotic transporters are frequently unknown. We compare several molecular fingerprint encodings for marketed small-molecule drugs, evaluating their rank order based on Tanimoto similarity to the most similar endogenous human metabolite from Recon2. For most drugs, the rank order varies significantly with the encoding used and somewhat when Tanimoto similarity (TS) is replaced by Tversky similarity. However, for approximately 10% of the set, with a Tanimoto similarity of ~0.8 or greater, the similarity coefficient is relatively robust. This suggests that a Tanimoto similarity of 0.75-0.8 or higher genuinely indicates significant structural similarity in the drug-endogenite space. The majority of these molecules are similar to natural products.

**Title:** Spatial Isotope Tracer Metabolomics to Study 13C Labelled Metabolite Distribution in 3D Tumor Spheroid Cell Culture
**Presenting Author:** Prasad Phapale, EMBL, Germany
**Co-Authors:** Mariia Naumenko, Karin Mitosch, Theodore Alexandrov

**Abstract:**
Tracer-based studies in 2D cell cultures do not provide information about spatial aspects of metabolism, neglecting spatio-molecular gradients and the 3D microenvironment characteristic of tissues and tumors. Multicellular tumor spheroids in 3D cell cultures are established in vitro models to mimic primary tumors. Studying the distribution of isotope-labeled metabolites in spheroids can provide valuable spatial insights into 3D tumor metabolism. Here, we present a method combining 13C6-glucose as a tracer in 3D cell culture and untargeted LC-MS/MS analysis to map central carbon metabolism spatially across different layers of spheroids. HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells were cultured for 10 days in Nunclon SpheraTM plates. Metabolites and lipids were extracted from each layer and the respective culturing medium for untargeted metabolomic profiling using our high-resolution LC-MS/MS-based EMBL-MCF platform (protocols available online at https://www.embl.de/mcf/metabolomics-core-facility/protocols). Preliminary results show the highest incorporation of 13C-label in layer 1 and the lowest in layer 3. The number of carbons labeled for pyruvate, succinate, sugar phosphates, other glycolytic metabolites, and amino acids decreases from layer 1 to layer 3. The necrotic core, containing dead cells, had the least incorporation of the 13C label, suggesting diffusion of labeled metabolites across layers. Our results indicate that this method is useful for investigating spatial aspects of metabolic fluxes in a tumor spheroid model.

**Title:** Microengineered Human Blood Vessel for Next-Generation Drug Discovery
**Presenting Author:** Abidemi Junaid, Systems Biomedicine and Pharmacology, LACDR, Leiden University, Netherlands

**Abstract:**
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with cardiovascular complications, including heart failure. To identify early prognostic factors for heart failure in CKD, we aim to explore the association of circulating plasma factors with microvascular integrity. Current 2D models with cultured endothelial cells lack sufficient complexity to assess the functionality of microvascular endothelial-pericyte interactions, leading to a reliance on pre-clinical animal models for ischemia/reperfusion injury. We developed a microfluidics-based, 3D 'microvessel-on-a-chip' platform that models patient-specific human microvessels and allows quantitative and parallel testing of microvascular leakage. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured to generate microvessels-on-a-chip. The layout of the microfluidics platform was modified to measure microvascular leakage of fluorescently labeled albumin using high-resolution time-lapse fluorescent microscopy. In this small volume platform, we measured critical metabolites in disease progression using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics. Additionally, we developed an approach to test plasma samples of patients suffering from vascular diseases for the presence of destabilizing factors such as thrombin or TNF-alpha. Our platform may serve as a unique tool for microvascular destabilization studies and the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat cardiovascular complications. Plasma samples with a destabilizing profile may predict ongoing microvascular rarefaction and the risk of cardiovascular complications.

**Title:** Stable Isotope-Resolved Metabolomics (SIRM) Defines DEK Oncogene-Driven Metabolic Reprogramming in 3D Epidermal Organoids
**Presenting Author:** Sara Vicente-Muñoz, NMR-Based Metabolomics Core Facility, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, United States
**Co-Authors:** Marie C Matrka, Miki Watanabe, Marion G Brusadelli, Kaylin Earnest, Andrew N Lane, Lindsey E Romick-Rosendale, Susanne I Wells

**Abstract:**
The DEK oncoprotein is amplified and overexpressed in many malignancies, including squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) originating in keratinocytes of the human epidermis. Our previous work on 2D cell models demonstrated that DEK overexpression reprogrammed metabolism at the level of aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation without proliferative gains, indicating that DEK drives metabolic reprogramming. Engineered 3D epidermal organoids, which mimic stratified human epidermis, show induction of hyperplasia by DEK overexpression and a significant shift in steady-state metabolism. To reconstruct global metabolic networks in 3D models of human epidermis, we applied stable isotope-resolved metabolomics (SIRM) on epidermal organoids. The goal was to define DEK-driven metabolic pathways and specific enzymes and their roles in enabling and sustaining oncogenic phenotypes. Normal immortalized keratinocytes were transduced with either control or DEK overexpression vector, placed into 3D organoid culture conditions for 13 days, and then incubated with 13C6-glucose for an additional 24 hours before collection and metabolite extraction. NMR spectroscopy was used to determine positional isotopomers in downstream metabolites. Media aliquots were collected post-isotope addition to quantify 13C6-glucose consumption and de novo production of labeled metabolites. Incorporation of 13C6-glucose validated SIRM feasibility in this system; we observed numerous 13C-labeled metabolites, including lactate, alanine, glutamine, and glutamate. Comprehensive analyses of DEK-overexpressing versus control organoids defined reprogrammed pathways, including glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and glutathione metabolism. Current experiments aim to target therapeutically relevant enzymes for the prevention of DEK-dependent SCC development and progression.

**Title:** Metabolomics as a Quality Control for the Production of Chondrogenic Microtissues Towards Characterized Endochondral Bone Regeneration
**Presenting Author:** Niki Loverdou, Prometheus, Division of Skeletal Tissue Engineering, KULeuven, Belgium
**Co-Authors:** G. Nilsson Hall, K. Bernaerts, B. Ghesquiere, G. Carmeliet, I. Papantoniou, L. Geris

**Abstract:**
The use of 3D microtissues is becoming a standard for bone tissue engineering approaches, as this format allows for cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Considering the role of metabolism as a key regulator of stem cell fate and the high sensitivity of metabolomics, this study aims to identify metabolic quality attributes indicative of a functional cartilage intermediate tissue-engineering construct. LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) tracer analysis was conducted to investigate metabolic alterations during chondrogenic differentiation of spheroids of hPDCs (human periosteum-derived stem cells). 13C-labeled glucose, glutamine, serine, and aspartate were used, as these metabolites showed significant differences between the time points of interest in a prior exometabolomics study. Samples were analyzed at day 0, day 14, and day 21, representing the proliferating, prehypertrophic, and hypertrophic states, respectively. Our tracer analysis results showed progressive 13C glucose enrichment in palmitate from 0% at day 0 to 8% at day 14 and 22% at day 21, suggesting activation of fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, we observed 13C glutamine enrichment in proline from 0% at day 0 to 20% at day 14 and 42.5% at day 21, and a similar trend of 13C glutamine contribution to hydroxyproline (from 0% at day 0 to 35% at day 14 and 38% at day 21). The consecutive stages of chondrogenic differentiation of hPDCs are characterized by specific metabolic adaptations, highlighting the importance of previously unexplored metabolic pathways such as fatty acid and glutamine metabolism for chondrogenic differentiation.
