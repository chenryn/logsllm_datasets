### Appendix

#### A. Malware Type

According to McAfee's virus naming convention, malware names consist of a prefix and suffix. The prefix specifies the type of file or platform the malware targets (e.g., JS, PDF, W32) or its "class" (e.g., Adware, Backdoor, Exploit, KeyLog). The suffix(es) designate variants of a malware, the byte size of the binary, or additional information about its type. In our McAfee dataset, there are 9,577 unique malware names. By stripping away the suffix, we are left with 1,097 unique malware names.

The top two malware names, encountered by 5.47% and 1.73% of the hosts, respectively, are "Artemis" and "Generic." The former is not a malware family but McAfee's name for those detected heuristically. The latter seems to be a generic detection that lacks additional information. Excluding these two, the encounter rates of the top 20 malware are shown in Figure 12. The shading of the boxes denotes the encounter rate for that malware in that country. Rows (and columns) are sorted according to a hierarchical clustering algorithm to minimize the Euclidean distance between adjacent rows (and columns).

**Figure 12:** The encounter rate in each country for the top 20 malware. The top ten countries with the most number of malware-encountering hosts are plotted.

Some patterns emerge from Figure 12. First, the malware encountered differs by geographic location. Some can be found in all countries (e.g., "RDN/Generic," "Generic Downloader"), while others are specific to certain locations (e.g., Autorun malware and worms in India and Egypt, and exploits in Western countries). Secondly, the diversity of malware in each country varies widely. Hosts in India encountered more than 300 different malware, while those in the U.K. only encountered 72. This suggests that the difference in the encounter rate per country may be partially due to the abundance of malware and the types of malware in that region.

To gain further insight into the categories of malware, we leverage the "class" information assigned by McAfee. The class keyword, e.g., Adware, Backdoor, Exploit, when available, is included in the prefix of the malware name. We find the malware class present in around 29.23% of the McAfee reports. Figure 13 shows the encounter rate of each malware class in each country.

**Figure 13:** The encounter rate of each malware class in each country. The top ten countries with the most number of malware-encountering hosts are plotted.

The top malware class, "Exploit," is encountered by 3.67% of the hosts. It seems to be especially common in India, Brazil, and South Korea, who share a similar makeup of malware classes. China stands out as having the highest "Dropper" encounter rate, perhaps due to the abundance of custom, free software available online in that region.

**Findings:**
- Malware types differ by geographic location, with some targeting specific regions while others are common to all countries.
- Exploits are the most common malware class in our dataset, particularly prevalent in India, Brazil, and South Korea.
- Droppers are mostly found in China, possibly related to the abundance of custom, free software available online in that region.
- Exploits primarily target vulnerabilities in JavaScript and Java, though a non-trivial fraction of hosts also encountered PDF exploits and those targeting the Windows Shell.

#### B. File System Location Categories

We group McAfee reports into the following categories based on the paths of detected malicious files:

- **External Drives:** The file was found on high-lettered drives (i.e., F and above) or is named "autorun.inf" located directly in the root directory of the drive. Even though personal machines can have multiple internal, physical drives, enterprise-owned PCs were placed under a relatively restrictive configuration policy. All were shipped with identical configurations except in special cases. Employees were also not given administrator privileges on their machines by default. As a result, the vast majority of hosts have only drives C and D.
- **Temporary Files:** The file was found under a temporary folder in the application directory (e.g., "C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Local\Temp"). This folder is commonly used to store secondary downloads by an initial infection.
- **Web Cache:** The file was found in the browser's cache, e.g., in the "Temporary Internet Files" directory, or the "cache" folder under the browser's directory. In this case, the malware likely arrived on the victim through drive-by downloads.
- **Download:** The file was found on the user's desktop or in the default folder storing downloaded files (e.g., "C:\Users\User Name\Downloads"). This is often associated with intentional downloads performed by the user.
- **Application:** The file was found under the applications data directory, which stores user-specific application information, including configuration files, default templates, etc. An example directory path is "C:\Documents and Settings\User Name\Application Data\."

#### C. Additional Related Work

In addition to the studies discussed in Section 5, several other studies have been conducted that deserve mention, albeit using different methodologies and providing less directly comparable results.

- **Regional Differences:**
  - Caballero et al. [2] observed families of malware preferentially delivered to the U.S. and Europe, and others exclusively targeted to a single country.
  - Kleiner et al. [6] examined the impact of socio-economic factors in a country or region on malware infections. They also found countries that implement policies for investigating and prosecuting cybercrime offenses to have a lower infection rate.

- **Internet-Wide Studies:**
  - Numerous studies have investigated the characteristics of malware proliferation by studying traffic sent by apparently infected machines (scans, spam, denial-of-service packets, etc.) on the public Internet.
  - For example, Collins et al. [5] demonstrated the tendency of malware infections to cluster within the same networks (identified by CIDR blocks) over time and how this tendency can be used to predict where such infections will likely occur in the future.
  - Ramachandran and Feamster [10] and Xie et al. [15] studied spam feeds to quantify, at the granularity of autonomous systems, where spam bots most often arise; the Xie et al. study further noted that the top five autonomous systems by this measure are all Internet service providers that offer residential network access.
  - Zhang et al. [22] found that "mismanaged" autonomous systems, such as those that have open DNS resolvers, lack egress filtering, allow untrusted HTTPS certificates, etc., are more likely to be responsible for malicious activities.

- **User Behavior:**
  - Ethnographic studies focused on other online behaviors and threats include:
    - Sheng et al. [11] used Mechanical Turk to evaluate how gender, age, technical knowledge, risk perception for financial investment, and prior exposure to anti-phishing training impacted susceptibility to phishing attacks in a role-playing exercise.
    - Milne et al. [7] studied the relationships of both participant self-efficacy and demographics (e.g., age) to the participants' online behaviors.
    - Lee [2] conducted an epidemiological study in an academic environment and determined that the employees' department and job type are indicative of their susceptibility to targeted phishing attacks.
    - Onarlioglu et al. [9] found that non-technical users demonstrated an ability comparable to that of security experts in averting frequently encountered threats but performed poorly at detecting more unusual and sophisticated ones.

- **Server Compromises:**
  - Vasek and Moore [14] explored factors relating to the compromise of web servers. Specifically, they quantified the relationship between compromise and the type of web server, type of content management system (CMS), hosting country, and secure administration practices demonstrated on the website using logistic regression models.

#### D. Employee Job Types

In this section, we summarize each job type introduced in Section 3.3, including the fraction of all users with that job type and a brief description of the job type.
