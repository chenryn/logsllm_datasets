## Abstract
Live streaming has become one of the most popular internet activities. Recently, there has been a significant increase in free live streaming (FLS) services that provide unauthorized broadcasts of live events, attracting millions of viewers. These opportunistic providers often have modest network infrastructures and monetize their services through advertising and data analytics, raising concerns about performance, quality of experience (QoE), and user privacy. In this study, we measure and analyze the behavior of 20 FLS sports sites on Android smartphones, focusing on packet-level, video player, and privacy aspects. Additionally, we compare FLS services with two legitimate online sports networks. Our results show that FLS sites suffer from scalability issues during highly popular events, deliver lower QoE than legitimate providers, and often use obscure and/or suspicious tracking services. Therefore, caution is advised when using FLS services.

## 1. Introduction
In 1995, Progressive Networks (now RealNetworks) broadcast the first live sports streaming event on the Internet, featuring a baseball game between the Seattle Mariners and the New York Yankees [26]. Since then, the widespread adoption of smartphones and the emergence of mobile internet technologies (4G, 5G, and LTE) have enabled users to watch live events from anywhere with ease. Mobile video streaming, including live streaming, currently accounts for 75% of total mobile data traffic [6]. This high demand for video streaming presents both an opportunity and a challenge for network service providers.

For users, the Quality of Experience (QoE) for video streaming is crucial [10]. QoE can be measured subjectively, where human viewers rate video sessions on a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) scale, or objectively, by collecting information from different protocol layers and using mathematical models to estimate QoE [27]. Several studies have mapped network-level Quality of Service (QoS) parameters to user QoE [23]. This paper focuses on network-level and video QoS parameters that impact QoE.

The growing popularity of live sports streaming has led to the emergence of many free live streaming (FLS) sites. However, using these unauthorized and unregulated providers raises concerns about QoS, QoE, and user privacy. For instance, these FLS sites may lack adequate network infrastructure to deliver scalable services, leading to poor QoS and QoE. Furthermore, many FLS sites recoup operational costs through advertising and data analytics, raising concerns about the collection and use of user-level information.

Previous research efforts have focused on blocking live broadcasting sites [21, 29] or detecting security leaks in FLS sites [25]. Despite these efforts, many internet users still seek out these free sites, and the number of FLS sites and users continues to grow [1].

In this paper, our premise is that users should be aware of the trade-offs associated with video streaming sites, including performance (i.e., QoS and QoE) and security and privacy. We study live sports streaming from both free and legitimate sites, providing insights into how video providers deliver their services and the QoS provided. Based on these insights, users can make better-informed decisions about using these services.

The research questions in our work are:
- What are the performance characteristics of FLS providers?
- What is the network and video QoS provided by FLS services?
- Are these services scalable for popular events?
- What privacy risks are associated with these services?

To study live sports streaming, we collected network traffic measurement datasets from several FLS sports sites during NHL, NBA, NFL, and UEFA (soccer) games in the 2019–2020 season. We customized an existing mobile video streaming measurement tool [18] to capture video streaming sessions from different viewpoints. We also compared FLS results with two popular monthly-paid service providers (TSN and DAZN).

The main contributions of this paper are:
- A network traffic measurement study of FLS sports sites during selected NHL, NBA, NFL, and UEFA games in the 2019–2020 season.
- Measurement and analysis of the delivered network and video QoS for FLS services on a smartphone.
- Comparison of live video streaming from FLS websites with two well-known monthly paid online sports networks.
- Investigation of privacy concerns when using FLS services on smartphones.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background on FLS. Section 3 describes our experimental methodology, measurement environment, and data collection process. Section 4 presents our measurement results. Section 5 summarizes prior related work. Section 6 concludes the paper.

## 2. Free Live Streaming
Free Live Streaming (FLS) services provide an infrastructure that allows internet users to watch live events for free. Users can access live streams (often without the owner’s permission) without registration [13]. In these services, channels are not cataloged or listed in directories and are not searchable via the website. Instead, channel owners usually share links in online social network communities to reach viewers. One example is Reddit, a popular online social network where users discuss, share, and rate web content.

There are five major players in the FLS ecosystem:
- **Media Providers**: Provide and stream the media content.
- **Channel Providers**: Receive live streams from media providers and serve them to users.
- **Aggregators**: Provide a list of available streams for users to browse.
- **Advertisers**: Support the above three entities through ads and overlays.
- **Users**: Watch their favorite live stream events found via the aggregators [1].

Sports streaming services are popular and constantly evolving [25, 30]. In this paper, we study web-based sports FLS services from a vantage point in Canada.

## 3. Measurement Methodology
Analyzing live video streaming on smartphone devices faces many challenges [8]. Video streaming characteristics such as QoE must be observed to understand user reactions. Multimedia streams may be encoded using different video codecs, and devices may receive different resolutions and bitrates depending on screen size, location, end-to-end network status, and membership type. Processing and analyzing captured traffic is another challenge due to the volume of network traffic involved. Encryption further complicates measurement and analysis.

We used MoVIE [18], an open-source mobile video streaming analyzer, to capture and analyze live video sessions on an Android smartphone. MoVIE provides a multi-level view of video streaming by intercepting and analyzing all incoming and outgoing network traffic. MoVIE analyzes video streaming at the packet-level, flow-level, and video player level. We extended the existing MoVIE tool by adding a Privacy View component to its Traffic Interceptor component. We leveraged EasyList [2] from the ad-blocker community to investigate generated flows for potential ads, trackers, and malicious connections.

### 3.1 Experimental Setup
We set up a controlled measurement environment to capture transmitted packets, flows, and video player activities during live streaming events. Table 1 shows our system specifications. The mobile device and PC were connected to the same WiFi access point. We ran MoVIE on a Linux PC using MITMproxy [7] to intercept network traffic and Wireshark to capture traces of the internet traffic generated by the smartphone. MoVIE captured all video player activities using an Android application that exploits the Google Chrome media feature.

| **Device** | **OS** | **CPU** | **Cores** | **RAM** | **Video Player** |
|------------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Smartphone | Android 8.1.0 | 2.15 GHz | 4 | 4 GB | Google Chrome v71 |
| PC | Ubuntu 18.4 | 3.6 GHz | 8 | 8 GB | Google Chrome v79.0.3945 |

All video streaming sessions were streamed using the Google Chrome browser. We performed a factory reset to ensure no other software or previous experiments impacted our results. We updated the OS and pre-installed apps to the latest versions and cleared the browser history and cache before each streaming session. During each session, the Chrome browser played video streams on the smartphone, while Wireshark and MoVIE captured network traffic at the packet level. For each FLS website, we captured a video streaming session of 1–5 minutes in duration.

Since MITMproxy v4.0 cannot decrypt HTTPS traffic from an updated Android device, we rooted the Android mobile device using the Magisk tool. Rooting allowed us to install the Charles proxy certificate in system mode. Finally, we installed a CA Certificate on the mobile device. Charles proxy [3] version 4.2.8 was installed on the PC to capture and decrypt all SSL connections generated from the smartphone, providing more data for privacy analysis.

Once the measurement environment was set up, we started the data collection tools on the PC and the video streaming on the mobile device. After capturing all network traffic, we used MoVIE to analyze the data.

### 3.2 Data Collection
To collect our dataset, we focused on FLS websites shared in sports-themed sections on Reddit. We monitored these forums during the NHL, NBA, NFL, and UEFA Champions League 2019–2020 season to find popular FLS providers.

Reddit has subreddits, which are like web forums where users discuss and share content. Subreddits are openly accessible, and shared content is not limited to registered users, members, or friends. Ayers et al. [1] analyzed data from Alexa and SimilarWeb [4] and observed that the Reddit community receives up to 86 million visits a month from users looking for sports streams.

We observed that free sports streams are usually aggregated and shared in a few popular subreddits. Users can like or dislike shared FLS websites, and those with more likes rise to the top of the webpage, attracting more visitors. Although there are approaches to automatically crawl and discover aggregator websites using online search engines [1], most FLS pages are not reachable via search engines, and service providers delete pages after events. For these reasons, we manually selected the top-5 most popular FLS websites based on user votes for each of NHL, NBA, NFL, and UEFA events.

To compare the performance of FLS services with legitimate providers, we considered several features from the packet-level to the application-level. Since streaming sports events are geo-restricted and specific sports events are available only through specific online sports channels within each region, we subscribed to two Canadian online sports channels. The main sports provider in Canada is TSN (The Sports Network), which holds the Canadian rights to the top sports events. We also studied DAZN, a relatively new sports streaming service in Canada.

Our collected dataset includes the top-5 popular (according to user likes) FLS websites in four popular sports, as gathered from the Reddit community, along with the two subscription-based sports streaming services. All videos were captured with the experimental setup mentioned in the previous subsection. We analyzed the captured data of an NBA game in December 2019, the NFL SuperBowl in February 2020, a UEFA playoff game in February 2020, and an NHL game in March 2020. All captured events occurred before the global shutdown of sports events due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. All captured network data, video streaming logs, and player activities are available online [17]. We used the traceroute command to determine the geographic locations of streaming sessions. Generally, UEFA events were streaming from European countries, while NBA, NHL, and NFL events were streaming from North America. However, some FLS sites use CDNs, making it difficult to determine their originating locations.

## 4. Measurement Results
To gain a comprehensive view of FLS, we evaluated video streaming from four different viewpoints: Network QoS, Video QoS, QUIC, and privacy.

### 4.1 Network Quality of Service (QoS) Analysis
Most FLS providers record live events from a legitimate streaming service and broadcast them simultaneously [1], making the quality of these services uncertain. To evaluate the network QoS provided by FLS websites, we analyzed the packet-level traffic transferred during the streaming sessions.

#### Throughput
Several studies have proposed intelligent throughput-aware bitrate selection and adaptation algorithms for video players to improve QoE in adaptive streaming techniques [32]. These algorithms predict throughput and determine the bitrate for the next chunk of the video. High throughput variation can result in quality switches or stalls during playback [15].

Figure 2(a) shows boxplots of the average throughput for FLS and legitimate providers. Legitimate sites had throughputs of 4–9 Mbps, compared to 1–6 Mbps for FLS sites. FLS throughputs were higher for NFL and NHL sites and lower for UEFA and NBA sites. FLS sites faced problems during popular games, such as the 2019 NBA Finals, where a Canadian team won the championship for the first time in NBA history. During this event, FLS websites could not always deliver video, and some rejected new users with the message "Viewer limit reached." Table 2 in the Appendix provides further details for each service provider, and time-series graphs of throughput are available on our project website [17].

#### Delay
Network packet delay is an important performance characteristic of a computer network [3, 28]. We used ping to estimate the average delay of service providers, setting the ping packet size based on the average packet size of a video streaming session. We conducted the ping test during the games when the server was broadcasting and users were streaming. As shown in Figure 2(b), the average network delay for FLS sites tends to be much higher and varies more widely than legitimate sites, though it depends on their geographic location (e.g., some NHL streaming sites are in Calgary). Table 2 in the Appendix presents more detailed results for each service provider.

#### Packet Loss
We used the ping flood technique to study packet loss. We observed that packet loss for legitimate websites is about 0%, while it is between 1% and 4% for FLS providers. Higher packet loss can indicate network problems. Zennaro et al. [33] observed that packet loss below 1% is good, 1%–2.5% is acceptable, 2.5%–5% is poor, 5%–12% is very poor, and packet loss in excess of 12% is bad. Their observations showed that above 5% packet loss, video conferencing becomes irritating and incomprehensible. The number of packet losses for each streaming site is shown in Table 2 in the Appendix.

### 4.2 Video Quality of Service (QoS) Analysis
In this section, we analyze the video QoS for our sports streaming websites.

#### Startup Time
Startup time is the elapsed time between when the user requests a video stream and the start of playback. This metric includes network delays (e.g., RTT, DNS, CDN) and the initial buffering delay [9]. Previous studies have shown that startup time is important, though it has a small impact on QoE [20, 34]. As shown in Figure 3(a), legitimate websites start playing a video about 1 to 2 seconds faster than FLS sites. We observed 8 to 16 seconds of startup delay when streaming from NBA FLS providers.

#### Broadcast Delay
Broadcast delay is an intentional delay (often 7 seconds) inserted by live broadcasters to prevent mistakes or unacceptable content during live events. To calculate the real-time broadcast delay, we used information from two auxiliary websites to determine the actual time elapsed in a sports game: FlashScore.com and Bet365.com. FlashScore.com provides the fastest live and detailed stats of thousands of competitions in more than 30 sports, and Bet365 is one of the world's leading online gambling companies, covering over 30 different sports. As shown in Figure 3(b), DAZN had a broadcast delay of around 12 seconds for UEFA competitions. FLS services delivering UEFA games had between 1 and 4 minutes of broadcasting delay. This delay could be due to the time required for recording and broadcasting the video. Due to the nature of live sports events, immediacy is extremely valuable. In general, live events streamed from FLS websites are not always truly "live" streams.

Some FLS websites, particularly NHL aggregators, have a broadcasting delay of around 30–35 seconds. By reviewing video player activities, we observed that these FLS services use channel providers like Wstream or Vimeo to deliver live streaming while recording videos. We also used the traceroute tool to locate the source of streaming but found that these channel providers use CDNs like Akamai to deliver videos to users. Pandey et al. [24] also noted the use of Akamai CDNs by 4 of 12 illegal sports and news streaming providers studied. The most likely reason for using CDNs is to reduce latency for users.

#### Visual Quality
This metric indicates the average video resolution received by the video player, especially when the streaming rate and quality level are dynamically adapted to the available bandwidth, such as in DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) [31]. In our experiment, the two legitimate websites and several FLS websites (except NBA providers) provide HD video quality. However, we observed that the transferred data for the same duration of the same video streaming on a legitimate website is higher than on FLS websites.

#### Quality Switches
The number of quality changes is another video QoS factor that affects QoE [23]. The number of quality switches is calculated by counting the number of video resolution changes over the duration of the video session. We observed that 11 out of 20 FLS sites experienced two or more quality switches. We also found that a few FLS providers did not switch to lower resolution when necessary, leading to stalling and rebuffering.

## 5. Related Work
Previous research has focused on blocking live broadcasting sites [21, 29] or detecting security leaks in FLS sites [25]. Despite these efforts, many internet users still seek out these free sites, and the number of FLS sites and users continues to grow [1]. Our study complements this work by providing a comprehensive analysis of FLS services, including network and video QoS, scalability, and privacy concerns.

## 6. Conclusion
In this paper, we conducted a network traffic measurement study of 20 FLS sports sites during the 2019–2020 season, focusing on packet-level, video player, and privacy aspects. We compared FLS services with two legitimate online sports networks and found that FLS sites suffer from scalability issues during highly popular events, deliver lower QoE than legitimate providers, and often use obscure and/or suspicious tracking services. Our findings highlight the need for caution when using FLS services. Future work will focus on developing methods to improve the QoE and privacy of FLS services.
