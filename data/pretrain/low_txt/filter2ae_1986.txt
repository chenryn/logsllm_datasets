### Introduction
Adobe ColdFusion is a commercial rapid development platform that can provide Flash remote services or serve as a backend server for Adobe Flex applications. On June 11, 2019, Adobe released a [security bulletin](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/coldfusion/apsb19-27.html) to address several critical vulnerabilities in Adobe ColdFusion, including a command injection vulnerability (CVE-2019-7839) reported by Moritz Bechler. On June 26, 2019, Moritz Bechler published [details](https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/38) of the remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2019-7839) on Bugtraq. This vulnerability arises from defects in the JNBridge component, which is enabled by default in ColdFusion.

### Affected Versions
- ColdFusion 2018 Update 3 and earlier
- ColdFusion 2018 Update 10 and earlier
- ColdFusion 11 Update 18 and earlier

### Exploitation Details
Due to the nature of the `java` project, graphical user interface (GUI) tools cannot be used. However, command-line tools are still viable. Below are the steps to exploit the vulnerability:

1. **View the Usage of `jnbproxy.exe`**
   ![Usage of jnbproxy.exe](https://images.seebug.org/content/images/2019/08/6e1642cb-c290-4e81-9560-1fc5ea666340.png-w331s)

2. **Generate the Required `runtime2.dll` Based on the Usage**
   ```sh
   jnbproxy /d C:\logDemo /cp C:\ColdFusion9\jnbridge\jre\lib\rt.jar /host localhost /n runtime2 /nj /pd n2j /port 6085 /pro b /pp C:\ColdFusion9\lib java.lang.Runtime java.lang.Process java.io.BufferedReader java.io.InputStreamReader java.lang.System
   ```

3. **Obtain `JNBShare.dll`**
   Fortunately, a version (v5.1) of `JNBShare.dll` has been collected and can be found via a Google search.

4. **Execute the Attack on Remote ColdFusion 9 (Windows) and Retrieve Command Execution Results**
