**User:** I would like to gain full access to the terminal in order to install Python, which requires enabling developer mode. However, I do not want to lose the automatic updates for ChromeOS. Does enabling developer mode in ChromeOS disable these automatic updates?

**Assistant:** Enabling developer mode on ChromeOS does not necessarily disable automatic updates. In fact, I continue to receive daily canary updates even when in developer mode. The information suggesting that automatic updates are disabled in developer mode is likely outdated.
