### Latency Measurement Using the Tor Network

To measure latency, we conducted tests using the actual Tor network. Specifically, we measured the latency with and without Tor between 10 geographically distributed machines and the top 200 university websites as reported by Alexa. To ensure that DNS lookup times did not influence the results, we resolved the URLs of these sites in advance. We chose university websites because they are less likely to redirect traffic based on source addresses, unlike popular commercial sites.

As shown in Figure 8(b), users of LAP (Low-Latency Anonymity Protocol) experience significantly lower latency compared to Tor users. Specifically, 90% of LAP requests complete in less than one second, while more than 99% of Tor requests take longer than one second.

### Throughput Evaluation

We evaluated the impact of LAP on throughput using Netperf 2.5.09 with synthetic traffic of varying packet sizes. Figure 8(c) illustrates the average throughput for both LAP-disabled and LAP-enabled systems. Our observations indicate that throughput increases with packet size in both cases. However, the throughput for LAP-enabled systems is slightly lower than for LAP-disabled systems, as LAP requires additional processing time. Nevertheless, the difference in throughput is minimal, especially when the packet size exceeds 1 KByte. This result confirms that LAP has a negligible impact on router performance.

Additionally, we compared the throughput between LAP and Tor using a small testbed that included LAP and a private Tor network with three Tor relays. In this setup, four machines were connected via 1-Gbps links, each serving a specific role: source, destination (file server), intermediate machine running three Tor relays, and a Tor directory server. We measured the average throughput of a client machine downloading a 10-GB file from the file server for both LAP and Tor. The results showed that the average throughput for Tor was 50.79 Mbit/s (σ = 1.41), while for LAP it was 939.50 Mbit/s (σ = 32.76), indicating a significant improvement in throughput with LAP.

### Summary

The overhead imposed by LAP is minor, making it suitable for practical deployment. While there is a slight decrease in throughput, LAP significantly enhances anonymity in current IP networks.

### Related Work

#### Anonymity Protection Schemes
The most closely related schemes for anonymity protection, such as "Tor Instead of IP" [14] and AHP [7], are described and compared in the security analysis section (Section VII).

#### High-Stretch Anonymity Systems
In Chaum’s mix network [8], layer-encrypted messages are sent through a list of mixes, which can buffer, reorder, and decrypt/encrypt messages to defend against a global eavesdropper. However, the delays and reordering make it impractical for real-time communication.

Onion routing systems, such as Tor [1], enable low-latency, bi-directional anonymous communication by sending layer-encrypted packets through indirect and unpredictable cryptographic circuits [37]. Unlike mix networks, onion routing systems are designed to defend against local attackers or government-class adversaries that observe only a fraction of the network. Under certain realistic attacker scenarios, onion routing systems are more secure than mix networks [38].

Tarzan [39] explores onion routing in a peer-to-peer setting, and ANDaNA [40] adopts Tor in content-centric networking. However, onion routing systems still suffer from high latency due to high path stretch. To reduce Tor’s latency, new relay selection algorithms have been proposed, considering relay geolocations or link characteristics in addition to relay bandwidth [4], [41]. Further studies are needed to understand their impact on existing attacks against Tor.

Researchers have also explored solutions without layered encryption. For example, Information slicing [42] achieves source and destination anonymity through multi-path and secret sharing but operates on overlays and suffers from noticeable latency. Crowds [43] leverages a crowd of users to collaboratively remove the trace of the real requester, and Hordes [44] exploit inherent crowds within multicast groups for receiver anonymity. Both Crowds and Hordes significantly stretch end-to-end paths.

#### Low-Stretch Anonymity Systems
Using a single anonymous proxy, such as anonymizer.com [45], results in low path stretch. However, users must trust a remote proxy to hide the linkage between sender and receiver, and the proxy can become a single point of failure.

Censorship-resilient systems like Decoy routing [46], Telex [47], and Cirripede [48] rely on ISPs to redirect traffic to blocked destinations. Although they also require enlisting ISPs for protection, they place trust in remote ISPs to defend against strong adversaries monitoring local networks.

#### Attacks on Anonymity Systems
Several researchers have studied passive and active attacks on anonymity systems. Passive attacks involve de-anonymizing traffic by observing side-channel information such as packet timing [49], clock skew [35], and unique system state [50], [51]. However, such attacks often fail to scale or rely on information leaked from higher-layer protocols. Active attacks, such as DoS, can accelerate traffic correlation. By clogging the network and monitoring latency changes, an attacker can identify Tor entry nodes [20], [21] and locate Tor users [22]. LAP can mitigate DoS-based attacks by selectively publishing encrypted paths.

Low-latency anonymity systems are inherently vulnerable to timing and traffic analysis [22], [23], [52], as an adversary can easily correlate the traffic patterns of a sender and a receiver. Since our goal is to provide topological anonymity, we consider temporal side-channel attacks as future work.

### Conclusions

Current anonymous communication systems achieve a high level of anonymity against strong attackers but at the cost of high communication latency, in-network computation, and storage state. This high latency significantly slows down the Internet browsing experience.

Reducing this overhead would make anonymous communication more usable. Many users can live with a relaxed attacker model, trusting their local ISPs but wanting protection from tracking by distant ISPs and websites. Given this weaker attacker model, we aim to provide source and destination anonymity, session unlinkability, and location privacy with minimal overhead, comparable to non-anonymous communication.

Our approach is simple yet effective: by leveraging encrypted packet-carried forwarding state, ISPs that support our protocol can efficiently forward packets towards the destination, further camouflaging the source or destination address or its location. Although encrypted packet-carried forwarding state is not currently supported in IP, we design simple extensions to IP to enable this technology. This approach is particularly relevant in future network architectures.

This new approach in the design space of anonymity protocols can be used in conjunction with other techniques, such as Tor, to prevent one Tor node from learning its successor. Despite having weaker security properties than Tor, LAP provides a significant benefit in providing topological anonymity and is practical for all communication.
