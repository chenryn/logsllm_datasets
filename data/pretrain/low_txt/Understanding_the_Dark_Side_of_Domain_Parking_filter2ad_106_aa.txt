**Abstract:**
Domain parking is a lucrative business generating millions of dollars in revenue. However, it is also one of the least regulated sectors, with parked domains frequently linked to illicit online activities. This paper presents the first systematic study on the "dark side" of domain parking, using a novel infiltration analysis method. By controlling traffic sources (crawlers), start nodes (parked domains), and end nodes (advertisers and traffic buyers), we were able to observe the entire monetization process. Our analysis revealed the presence of click fraud, traffic spam, and traffic stealing. We further examined these issues across 24 million monetization chains collected over 5.5 months, confirming that some parking services derive up to 40% of their revenue from illicit activities. Our findings underscore the need for better regulation of domain parking.

**Introduction:**
Imagine you are a domain owner with several unused domain names. One option is to "park" them with a domain parking service to earn additional income. When web users accidentally type these domain names into their browser, the parking service displays ad-laden pages, and the generated revenue is split between the service and the domain owner. This monetization model is a multi-million-dollar industry, offering a unique marketing channel through underdeveloped or reserved domains. However, with millions of parked domains, the security implications and potential involvement in illicit activities remain unclear. Prior research suggests that malicious domains often end up being parked, raising concerns about the quality of traffic and potential fraudulent activities. Despite these suspicions, it has been challenging to determine the extent of such activities due to the lack of transparency in parking services' operations.

**Our Study:**
In this paper, we present the first comprehensive exploration of the dark side of domain parking. We developed an innovative methodology to infiltrate parking services by purchasing and parking a set of domains, while continuously exploring parked domains with our crawlers. On the receiving end, we launched ad campaigns and purchased web traffic through associated networks. By carefully tuning parameters, we connected the dots, observing complete monetization chains. Our analysis confirmed the presence of click fraud, traffic spam, and traffic stealing. For example, our ad campaigns were charged for "click" traffic generated by our crawler, which never actually clicked on any ads. Additionally, only a portion of the visits through our parked domains was reported to our domain-owner's account, even though all were billed to our ad account.

To further analyze the scope and magnitude of these issues, we fingerprinted confirmed illicit monetization chains and used these features to identify similar activities in 24 million visits to parked domains. Our findings indicate that even leading parking services are involved in illegitimate operations, although such activities were present in only about 5% of the observed traffic. The motivations behind these opportunistic attacks may include monetizing less reputable domains or compensating for revenue losses. An economic study estimated that these illicit activities can account for up to 40% of the total revenue for some parking services.

**Contributions:**
- **New Methodologies:** We conducted the first systematic study of illicit activities in parked domain monetization, made possible by new methodologies that allowed us to infiltrate parking services and collect complete monetization chains.
- **New Findings:** Our study revealed the presence and pervasiveness of illegitimate operations, including click fraud, traffic spam, and traffic stealing, affecting most leading parking service providers. These activities can account for up to 40% of their total revenue.

**Parked Domain Monetization:**

**2.1 Background:**
- **Domain Parking:** A parked domain is a registered domain name temporarily used as an ad portal to profit from its traffic. The domain owner typically parks the domain with a parking service, which gains control over the domain and its traffic. The most common way to do this is through DNS settings, where the parked domain's Name Server (NS) or Canonical Name record (CNAME) points to the parking service.
- **Monetization Options:** The primary monetization options for parked domains include search advertising and direct navigation traffic. In search advertising, the publisher (parking service) serves textual ads relevant to the domain names, and the revenue is shared between the publisher and the ad network. Direct navigation traffic (PPR) involves redirecting type-in traffic to related domains, ultimately benefiting traffic buyers.

**2.2 Ecosystem and Illicit Monetization:**
- **Ecosystem Overview:** Figure 2 illustrates the domain parking ecosystem, showing the flow of traffic from parked domains to advertisers and traffic buyers. Table 1 lists some of the most popular parking services, many of which rank among the top 100k by Alexa. Our analysis of data collected from leading parking services reveals the significant role they play in the domain industry and the suspicion of illicit activities within this ecosystem.

**Conclusion:**
Our study highlights the need for better regulation of domain parking to address the widespread illicit activities that can significantly impact the revenue and reputation of parking services. Future work should focus on developing more robust detection and prevention mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the domain parking ecosystem.
