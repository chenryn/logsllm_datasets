### 6. Ongoing Extension to the Approach

The current implementation of our detection mechanism is relatively straightforward, with the assumption that there is no message loss at the global detector. In our ongoing research, we are developing more realistic variations of the detection model. These variations will incorporate potential message loss due to mobility and noise, and we aim to understand the detection behavior under such conditions.

Several architectural challenges are being addressed:
1. **Scalability**: In realistic scenarios, a single global detector may not be sufficient. We are exploring the use of a set of cooperative detectors that can collectively cover the entire MANET, even under varying conditions.
2. **Promiscuous Monitoring**: Promiscuous monitoring in noisy MANET environments is unreliable. An alternative approach involves deploying cooperative detection agents on all nodes, which exchange messages containing the necessary local minimum information.
3. **Cost Metrics**: We are conducting detailed studies of various cost metrics, including bandwidth usage, latency effects, and false positive and false negative rates under different scenarios. This includes examining temporary inconsistencies in the new distributed detection architecture.

These extensions are being developed under the cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture proposed in [30]. Additionally, we are extending authentication techniques, such as TESLA [7], for the authentication of forwarding messages. This will help us resolve the assumptions in our model and enable its implementation in more realistic platforms.

### 7. Related Work

Most Intrusion Detection System (IDS) approaches for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) focus on detecting malicious packet dropping, which includes both routing and data packets. Here, we briefly review these approaches, as this intrusive behavior is one of several that can disrupt MANET routing.

- **General Packet Drop Detector**: A general packet drop detector for MANETs is described in [18].
- **Statistical Approach**: Rao and Kesidis [9] present a statistical approach using estimated congestion at intermediate nodes to detect malicious packet dropping.
- **Reputation-Based Systems**: Approaches in [1], [2], and [5] use reputation systems to identify and exclude misbehaving nodes.
- **Distributed Firewall Mechanism**: Ramanujan et al. [10] propose a system to detect, avoid, and recover from attacks targeting the routing function in ad hoc networks.

The case for a cooperative IDS architecture for MANETs was first made by Zhang and Lee [14], focusing on anomaly detection. More recent work by Huang and Lee [3] presents a cooperative cluster-based architecture, though its effectiveness in the dynamic MANET environment remains uncertain. Subhadhrabandhu et al. [29] evaluate strategies for placing IDS modules, while Sterne et al. [30] develop a cooperative intrusion detection architecture tailored for MANETs.

**Secure Routing Approaches**:
- **Cryptographic Approaches**: Several cryptographic methods, such as those in [4], [7], [13], [11], and [8], propose authentication protocols for secure routing. For example, Ariadne [4] uses the TESLA protocol [7] to secure the DSR routing protocol.
- **IDS Approaches**: These monitor routing control messages for signs of intrusive behavior. Gwalami et al. [17] use a stateful analysis of AODV control packet streams based on the State Transition Analysis Technique (STAT) [24]. Other works, such as [6] and [12], focus on specific routing protocols like AODV.

### 8. Conclusion

By analyzing the OLSR routing specification, we define normal OLSR routing behavior and list possible attack mechanisms from a single attacker. Based on this, nodes correctly establish and maintain their routing tables using Hello and TC messages. We develop constraints on these messages to ensure the integrity of the routing tables. The proof of satisfaction of these constraints is provided, and we implement the constraints and example attacks on the Glomosim simulation platform.

In future work, we aim to implement and deploy the model for more realistic MANET scenarios. This includes:
1. **Message Exchange Model**: Developing a model to allow distributed detectors to have the required minimum local routing information through message exchange.
2. **Enhanced Model**: Enhancing the model to handle message loss, delay, and false alarms.
3. **New Constraints**: Adding new constraints to monitor the forwarding behavior of OLSR TC messages and normal unicast packet forwarding.

Our final goal is to address all assumptions in the model for a realistic implementation.
