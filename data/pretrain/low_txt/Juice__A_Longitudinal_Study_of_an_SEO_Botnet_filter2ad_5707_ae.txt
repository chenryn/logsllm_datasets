### Time and Categorization of Redirection Chains

Time is a critical metric for understanding the duration a site remains part of the redirection chain. Using data from the Trajectory redirection crawler, we categorized the redirection chains that lead users from poisoned search results to various scams employed by the GR botnet to monetize traffic. Specifically, we selected redirection chains that:

1. Originated from one of the doorway pages.
2. Contained more than one cross-site redirection.
3. Occurred while mimicking a Microsoft Windows user running Internet Explorer.

As discussed in Section 5.4.2, the majority of redirect chains observed while mimicking a non-Windows user generally led to the RivaClick pay-per-click affiliate program. We manually clustered the redirection URLs based on similar URL characteristics, such as the same PHP file with the same HTTP GET parameters and arguments. For example, although `http://model-seil.ru/afro/index.php` and `http://softwarename.ru/protect/index.php` appear to represent two separate hosts, they resolve to the same IP address.

After clustering, we constructed a network graph starting from doorways and ending at different kinds of scams. This graph allows us to trace the scams where the botmaster was an affiliate.

### Shifts in Scam Targeting

Previous research has noted that SEO campaigns generally shift between different affiliate programs over time [19]. Therefore, for this analysis, we arbitrarily divided the redirect chains by the month when the chain was observed. Figure 9 shows the relative breakdown of the types of scams that the redirection chains take users to. The "misc" category refers to crawls that we could not classify, such as redirections that ultimately led to the Google search page, and "error" are crawls that returned an HTTP error code or screenshot.

We identified two distinct periods of scam targeting, with the transition coinciding with the 2011 fake AV takedown [8]. Early on, from April through August, the botnet redirected the majority of poisoned search results to fake AV programs, presumably due to their profitability [17]. We also observed varying amounts of redirection chains leading to counterfeit pharmaceutical programs, including GlavMed, Mailien, and RX-Partners, though these were not as prevalent as fake AV. From June through August, there was an increase in the proportion of search results directed to `movdl.com`, a pirated media affiliate program. However, redirection chains to `movdl.com` ceased in September.

After the fake AV takedown, the botmaster significantly changed the targeted scams. In September, the intermediary node that sent traffic to the remaining fake AV program began sending traffic to a drive-by download affiliate program. This target was also temporary, as by October, the botnet updated the SEO kit to version OEM and redirected the majority of the traffic to OEM affiliate programs (TheSoftWareSellers and OEMPays), which continued until December when the GR botnet stopped redirecting. Throughout this period, pay-per-click remained a steady safety net, and we explore it in more detail next.

### RivaClick Traffic Affiliate Program

Recall from Section 3.3 that we downloaded past versions of the SEO kit. While crawling these past versions, we found that the SEO campaign was actively redirecting users to the URL:
```
http://www.rivasearchpage.com/?aid=2277&said=0&n=10&q=[query]
```
This URL leads to a feed of URLs for the RivaClick Traffic Affiliate Program. RivaClick operates similarly to other internet advertising platforms. Advertisers buy traffic for specific topics of interest, usually determined by the user's query string, and publishers sell traffic. RivaClick groups advertisers' links into a feed, which is provided to publishers who receive commissions on click traffic to links from the feed. An important difference between RivaClick and other advertising platforms is that RivaClick provides few guarantees about the quality of the traffic being sold, allowing publishers to dump traffic obtained through search result poisoning.

Based on the URL extracted from a previous SEO kit and the HTTP GET parameters from the URL, it appears that the botmaster is an affiliate of RivaClick with ID 2277. With this affiliate identifier, we retroactively examined poisoned search results from the Trajectory crawler starting in March 2011. One pass of the search crawler captures the entire redirect chain for poisoned search results, from the doorway, through all intermediary hops, to the landing page. In this section, we focus on redirect chains that landed on RivaClick.

Figure 10 shows the quantity of poisoned search results funneled into RivaClick per day for the four most frequently seen affiliates: 810, 1678, 2277, and 2504. Because we found these affiliates performing search result poisoning, we assume they are running similar black hat SEO campaigns. Therefore, we compare the four affiliates to provide a sense of the relative size of the GR botnet and its peers and competitors in terms of the number of search results leading to RivaClick. The GR botnet, as affiliate 2277, redirected a small but steady number of search results to RivaClick for much of 2011, but then significantly increased results to RivaClick starting in October 2011 after the fake AV takedown. Meanwhile, the other affiliates showed more bursty patterns. Affiliate 1678 directed a small burst from April–May, and 2504 directed a burst from July–August. Finally, 810 redirected bursts from March–June, with a maximum of 1,231 on June 2. As a result, it appears that 2277 is a long-lasting, relatively mid-size SEO affiliate of RivaClick.

Figure 11 focuses more closely on affiliate 2277. The Trajectory search crawler visited each poisoned search result while mimicking three different browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer running on Windows, Mozilla Firefox running on Mac OS X, and Mozilla Firefox running on Linux. These three visits enabled us to analyze the traffic segmentation policy employed by the botmaster based on browser and operating system. Indeed, it appears that such demultiplexing occurred from March through September. As seen in Figure 11, only Mac OS X and Linux traffic led to RivaClick. Starting in August, when the botmaster could no longer monetize Windows traffic through fake AV scams, traffic from all platforms was redirected.

### Conclusion

Overall, we find that with modest resources, the GR botnet can be very effective in poisoning search results, becoming the dominant source of poisoned results for months at a time. We have observed two types of interventions against the SEO botnet. The first targets the botnet directly, its infrastructure (compromised sites), and vector (poisoned search results). Given that sites remain compromised for months, cleaning up sites has not been effective at undermining the botnet; indeed, even when we explicitly notified site owners about the malware, few reacted or responded. Google, however, is more responsive, tagging poisoned search results within a couple of days—but that window is still presumably effective for the botmaster given the intensity of the SEO activity. The second intervention undermines monetization and appears to be much more effective. With evidence of the importance of a "killer scam" in monetizing and driving innovation in SEO campaigns, we observe substantially more activity from the botnet when the fake anti-virus market is stable, whereas the botmaster scrambles to monetize traffic when the fake anti-virus market is in flux and the GR botnet becomes relatively idle. Undermining monetization appears to be a potent response to these types of attacks.
