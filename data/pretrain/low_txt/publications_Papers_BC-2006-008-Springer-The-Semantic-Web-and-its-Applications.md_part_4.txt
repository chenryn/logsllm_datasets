### Another Well-Known Life Science Ontology: MGED

The Microarray Gene Expression Data (MGED) ontology is a well-known life science ontology. It provides standardized terms in the form of an ontology, organized into classes with properties, for annotating microarray experiments (MGED 2005). These terms offer unambiguous descriptions of how experiments are conducted and enable structured queries of experimental elements. Standardized terminology is crucial for comparing different experiments, as it ensures consistency in describing experimental setups, mathematical post-processing of raw measurements, genes, tissues, and samples. The adoption of common standards by the research community facilitates the development of systems for managing, storing, transferring, mining, and sharing microarray data (Stoeckert, Causton et al. 2002).

If all microarray experiments conducted by different research groups were stored with the same structure in the same type of database, data manipulation would be relatively straightforward. However, in practice, different research groups have varying requirements, necessitating mappings and translations between different existing formats (Stoeckert, Causton et al. 2002).

### Semantic Web Processes and Their Applications

Software programs that utilize the MGED ontology can generate forms for annotation, populate databases directly, or create files in established formats. Researchers can use the ontology to annotate their experiments, while software developers can implement practical applications.

### Conclusions

Since its inception, the World Wide Web has primarily allowed computers to understand web page layouts for display purposes, without accessing their intended meaning. Now, the Web has evolved beyond just a medium for publishing data and documents; a web resource can be a component of the deep web (e.g., a queryable database) or a service that wraps an application. The semantic Web aims to enrich the current Web with a layer of machine-understandable metadata, enabling the machine processing of information and services. The semantic Web is not a separate entity but an extension of the current Web, where information and services are given well-defined meanings, thereby enhancing cooperation between computers and people. The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) has been actively working on defining open standards such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language) to facilitate the creation of the semantic Web, which is also important for e-commerce and e-science, involving the sharing of services and integration of intra- and inter-business processes (Berners-Lee, Hendler et al. 2001).

To fully appreciate the objectives of semantics and the semantic Web, it is essential to understand the role of semantics in science and computer science. Heterogeneity in data arises from differences in syntax, representation (e.g., format or structure), and semantics. Dealing with heterogeneity has been a key challenge since the advent of data exchange and sharing between computers and applications. The ease of publication and sharing of data and services on the Web, and the scale involved, has made this problem more significant. Among the various types of heterogeneity, semantic heterogeneity is particularly problematic, arising from disagreements about the meaning, interpretation, or intended use of the same or related data. One approach to addressing semantic heterogeneity is to rely on the technological foundations of the semantic Web, specifically by defining the meaning of data terminology using ontological concepts to clarify relationships and differences (Kashyap and Sheth 1996).

The theories, methodologies, algorithms, and technologies associated with the semantic Web make this approach a strong candidate for solving many problems faced by current systems. Areas such as Web services, tourism information systems, digital libraries, and bioinformatics are exploring the potential of semantics and ontologies to address integration and interoperability issues. For example, semantic Web services are an evolution of the syntactic definition of Web services and the semantic Web. By mapping concepts in a Web service description to ontological concepts, users can explicitly define the semantics of a Web service for a given domain. This enables the construction of queries using ontological concepts, leading to more relevant search results than keyword or attribute-based matching algorithms. Additionally, developing mappings for exchanging messages between services participating in a process can yield even more significant advantages (Sheth 2001).

### Questions for Discussion

**Beginner:**
1. Why is the search provided by Google, Yahoo!, and MSN not semantic?
2. Why and how can metadata help in dealing with unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data?

**Intermediate:**
1. Why do almost all semantic metadata efforts involve textual data? Does it make sense to have an ontology of icons or symbols?
2. What would it take to represent concepts found in the natural world, such as compounds and molecules?
3. Distinguish between database schemas and ontologies in terms of conceptual models, representation languages, intentions, uses, and development methodologies.
4. List various techniques used for metadata extraction from different computer science areas.
5. What are the differences in metadata for Web resources that are data versus services?
6. How would Amazon benefit from the use of a product ontology?

**Advanced:**
1. Discuss how you would define the quality of an ontology.
2. Distinguish between ontologies (representation, extraction/population, etc.) when modeling human activities (e.g., travel, financial services, sports, entertainment) versus natural phenomena and sciences (e.g., earthquakes, complex carbohydrates, protein-protein interactions, cancer research).

### Practical Exercises

1. Identify unstructured, semi-structured, and structured documents on the same subject matter, such as news about a football game. Develop a small ontology related to this subject matter and annotate each document.
2. Obtain at least one RDF(S) and one OWL ontology and load it using an ontology editor (e.g., Protégé).
3. Look up a tool or service on the Web for annotating web pages and web services.
4. Take a web page on a news site. Design a small ontology related to the subject matter or domain of that page. Write syntactic, structural, and semantic metadata for that page.
