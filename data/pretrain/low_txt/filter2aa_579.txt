## 8. Adjacency Discovery
- Importance in Network Topology
- Methods and Techniques

### Adjacency Discovery Example
- **Registrar**:
  - Supports network/domain X
  - Part of domain
  - Registrar domain certificate
  - Generates 3072-bit RSA key
  - Sends public key
- **Enrollee**:
  - Enrollee domain certificate
  - Receives public key from Registrar

## 9. Secure Channel
- Establishment Process
- Security Protocols
- Verification and Authentication

### Registrar Configuration
```plaintext
autonomic registrar
domain-id ERNW.de
whitelist flash:whitelist.txt
CA local
no shut
autonomic
```

### Enrollee Configuration

## 11. Are You in Control?
- Evaluating Autonomic Network Security
- Mitigating Risks

## 12. Autonomic Network: Under the Hood
- Deep Dive into Internal Mechanisms
- Troubleshooting and Maintenance

## 13. Channel Discovery (Detailed)
- Multiple Sessions on Channel Discovery

## 14. Adjacency Discovery (Detailed)
- Multiple Sessions on Adjacency Discovery

## 15. Secure Channel (Detailed)
- Additional Sessions on Secure Channel
- Security Enhancements

## 16. Live Chat Support
- Interaction with Support Team
- Issue Reporting and Resolution

### Example Interactions
- **Me**: Hi, I connected 2 nodes from 2 different domains and they built the secure channel!
- **Support**: Thanks for reporting, we created BugID CSCvd15717. We will check with the BU for that.
- **BU Response**: Both nodes have a certificate signed by the same CA, so they can connect.
- **Me**: Wait, what about different domains? This shouldn't be possible.
- **Support**: We will add a feature to check domains in the future!

### Other Issues
- **Me**: Hi, I can’t revoke the certificate of one of the accepted nodes.
- **Support**: Revoking certificates is not supported on local CA. We created CVE-2017-6664 for this issue.

- **Me**: The attacker can reset the secure channel remotely, and the information is in plain text.
- **Support**: We created CVE-2017-6665 for this issue.

- **Me**: If the attacker resets the channel multiple times, the node eventually crashes.
- **Support**: We created CVE-2017-6663 for this issue.

- **Me**: The attacker can crash the registrar by sending invalid enrollee IDs.
- **Support**: We created CVE-2017-3849 for this issue.

- **Me**: The attacker can perform a "DeathKiss" attack.
- **Support**: We created CVE-2017-3850 for this issue.

## 17. Identified Vulnerabilities and CVEs
- **CSCvd15717**: Cross-domain secure channel establishment
- **CVE-2017-6664**: Certificate revocation issue
- **CVE-2017-6665**: Remote secure channel reset
- **CVE-2017-6663**: Node crash due to repeated channel resets
- **CVE-2017-3849**: Registrar crash due to invalid enrollee IDs
- **CVE-2017-3850**: DeathKiss attack
