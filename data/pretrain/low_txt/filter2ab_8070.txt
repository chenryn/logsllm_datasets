**ATT&CK ID:** T1003.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** LSASS Memory

Adversaries may attempt to access credential material stored in the process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). After a user logs on, the system generates and stores various types of credential materials in the LSASS process memory. An adversary with administrative or SYSTEM-level privileges can harvest these credentials and use them for lateral movement by employing alternate authentication methods.

### Key Points:
- **Target:** Credential material stored in LSASS process memory.
- **Prerequisites:** Administrative or SYSTEM-level privileges.
- **Objective:** Harvest credentials to facilitate lateral movement.
- **Method:** Use alternate authentication material.

This technique is often used in conjunction with other tactics to gain unauthorized access to additional systems within the network.
