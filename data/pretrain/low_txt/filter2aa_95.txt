### Why Airport Security Can’t Be Done FAST

**Authors: Semon Rezchikov, Joshua Engelman, Morgan Wang**

**Introduction**

Hello, DEFCON 19 attendees!

In this document, we have compiled an outline of the information we gathered and a detailed list of our sources for further reading on the Future Attribute Screening Technology (FAST) program. This includes related programs such as MALINTENT, Hostile Intent, and SPOT. We believe this format will be more useful than our presentation slides, which were primarily visual aids and not comprehensive.

Our sources are categorized as follows: articles on SPOT, criticism of FAST, the legality of FAST, base rate fallacy, articles on FAST, government documents, and information on SDS (the Israeli version of FAST). All documents are in the public domain and can be accessed through creative Googling.

### Outline

#### FAST - Future Attribute Screening Technology
- **Run by**: DoD’s Behavioral Research Unit
- **Description**: A series of rooms equipped with biometric scanners that analyze physiological signs while someone is questioned to detect potential hostile intent. Essentially, it is a high-tech polygraph test.
- **Development**: Draper Labs appears to be the primary developer based on available information.

#### Related Projects
- **Project MALINTENT**: The overarching project aimed at detecting malintent.
- **Hostile Intent**: The specific technology designed to detect malintent.
- **FAST**: A practical, trailer-based implementation of malintent detection technology.

#### Historical Context
- **Paul Ekman**: Conducted extensive research on microexpressions and believed that deception detection could be reliable with proper training.
- **SPOT (Screening of Passengers by Observational Training)**: A TSA program based on Ekman’s research, training agents to read faces. Despite costing over $212 million annually, there is no evidence it has led to the conviction of a terrorist. Most convictions are related to other crimes like drug dealing.

#### How FAST Works
- **Process**:
  1. A person enters a FAST trailer at an airport.
  2. They are scanned by various sensors:
     - BioLIDAR for cardiovascular/respiratory data
     - Infrared camera for stress
     - Normal camera for pupil dilation, reddening, and facial expressions
     - Motion detectors for gait analysis
  3. They are asked a set of questions (e.g., "Are you planning to detonate a bomb in this airport?").
  4. If flagged as suspicious, they are re-scanned. If flagged again, they may be taken for further questioning or arrested.

#### Issues
- **False Positives**:
  - Large-scale systems must have very low false positive rates. Even a 0.1% rate would result in many innocent people being flagged due to the rarity of terrorists. FAST's false positive rates range from 1% to 17%.
- **Research Methodology**:
  - Subjects were instructed to act "shifty and evasive," which is not a reliable way to calibrate the system.
  - Baseline biometric measurements are unclear, and sick individuals may skew results.
- **Hacks**:
  - Using individuals with chronic illnesses or taking beta-blockers to manipulate biometric readings.

#### Legal Considerations
- **Fourth Amendment**:
  - **Plain View Doctrine**: Allows searches using senses and sense-enhancing tools (e.g., aerial surveillance, drug-sniffing dogs).
  - **Thermal Imaging Cameras**: Not allowed without a warrant (Kyllo v. United States).
  - **Administrative Search Exception**: Applies to current airport security measures.
  - **Medical Privacy Laws**: FAST involves medical-like examinations, potentially violating patient confidentiality laws.
- **Conclusion**: While FAST might initially pass government legality checks, it could face significant legal challenges from skilled lawyers.

#### Suspect Detection Systems (SDS)
- **Cogito**: An Israeli-developed biometric system similar to FAST. Results have been published.
