### Interoperability and Strategic Priorities

Despite the awareness of interoperability issues among elected officials and public safety executives, the Urban Area (UA) must take proactive measures to ensure that interoperability remains a political and fiscal priority. 

**Recommendations:**
- **Expand Participation:** Include federal and tribal agencies in the decision-making process.
- **Formalize Agreements:** Document, formalize, and implement necessary interoperability agreements (e.g., Memoranda of Understanding [MOUs]). Reference all applicable agreements in the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) and store them in an accessible format.
- **Engage Regional Responders:** Ensure the participation of all potential regional responders in the strategic plan.
- **Align Planning Efforts:** Coordinate local, state, and federal strategic planning to meet regional interoperability needs.
- **Funding Strategy:** Incorporate a regional interoperability funding strategy into the strategic plan, considering various funding models beyond grants to leverage local, regional, and statewide efforts.
- **Promote Interoperability:** Advocate for broader acceptance of communications interoperability as both a political and fiscal priority at the UA and state levels.

### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Established Implementation

The Kansas City UA’s TICP is based on existing SOPs, including discipline-specific mutual aid channel procedures that have been in place for several years. Officials noted that the TICP provided a regionwide focus on communications interoperability SOPs. Although the SOPs were finalized shortly before the TICP validation exercise, the UA has begun disseminating these policies to the included agencies. Some issues with SOPs (e.g., not including major city agencies' SOPs for mutual aid responses in their home area) were raised during the validation exercise, but the use of interoperable equipment was largely successful. The UA is also implementing the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS), which was effective at the sites where it was required during the exercise.

**Recommendations:**
- **Standardize SOPs:** Continue to standardize SOPs regionwide (e.g., activation procedures).
- **Disseminate SOPs:** Distribute SOPs beyond the TICP to participating agencies.
- **Training and Exercises:** Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs, ensuring NIMS/ICS compliance for all participating first responder agencies.

### Usage: Established Implementation

The Kansas City UA uses multiple shared systems for multi-agency communications interoperability, achieved through gateways and state and federal mutual aid channels. Successful tactical interoperable communications were observed during the TICP validation exercise, although some difficulties were encountered. Personnel overcame these issues, such as using radio caches when gateway activation problems occurred. While agencies demonstrated familiarity with mutual aid channels, inconsistent naming conventions caused confusion. Future tests should consider testing users outside their coverage area and involving additional state, federal, and support organizations.

**Recommendations:**
- **Involve State and Federal Agencies:** Include state and federal agencies in training and exercises.
- **Plan for Regionwide Events:** Train for a regionwide event involving disparate systems and users working outside their coverage area.
- **Incorporate Interoperability:** Add communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

### Technology Overview

The Kansas City UA has various 800 MHz, 700 MHz, VHF, and UHF radio communications systems. Interoperability is achieved through cached radios, gateways, shared channels, and shared systems. The UA plans to establish a multiband (800 MHz, 700 MHz, VHF, and UHF) regionwide radio communications system called RAMBIS, with infrastructure operating in simulcast mode. The default configuration will interconnect calling channels for 800 MHz, VHF, and UHF, acting as crossband repeaters. Channels designated TAC1 and TAC2 for all bands will be interconnected.

### St. Louis, MO: Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

**Summary:**
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Intermediate Implementation

**Governance: Intermediate Implementation**

The St. Louis Area Regional Response System (STARRS) was formed before the TICP process and includes state and federal agencies, actively recruiting new members throughout the UA. STARRS has four subcommittees (technical, channel programming, training and exercises, and planning/TICP), but steps should be taken to formalize the group’s authority and influence through an official charter. Individual organizations currently develop and maintain their own budgets and procure communications equipment based on agency-specific needs. The majority of current funding is through grants, and the UA is developing an interoperability strategic plan beyond the operational focus of the TICP.

**Recommendations:**
- **Publish a Charter:** Consider publishing a charter for the STARRS group.
- **Review Agreements:** Review agreements (e.g., MOUs) every 3 to 5 years and after significant events or system upgrades.
- **Develop a Strategic Plan:** Encourage the development and implementation of a strategic plan with participant approval and alignment with local and state strategic planning efforts.
- **Long-Term Funding:** Develop a long-term (3 to 5 years) interoperability funding strategy.
- **High-Level Involvement:** Involve high-level officials (e.g., mayor, city council member) with political and fiscal authority to focus on interoperability.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Established Implementation**

The St. Louis UA has communications equipment policies and procedures developed by the State Interoperability Executive Committee and the Department of Justice (DoJ) 25 Cities project. These policies were used to create the TICP, and SOPs were distributed during the TICP Implementation Workshop. However, further steps are needed to disseminate regional communications interoperability policies and procedures to all public safety agencies. The UA has been practicing NIMS/ICS for more than a year but experienced command and control issues during the TICP validation exercise.

**Recommendations:**
- **Distribute SOPs:** Disseminate regional communications interoperability SOPs to all stakeholders and ensure consistency with regional, statewide, and interstate planning efforts.
- **Training and Exercises:** Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance for all participating first responder agencies.

**Usage: Intermediate Implementation**

The St. Louis UA appears capable of employing interoperable communications capabilities, such as radio caches, shared channels, gateways, and shared systems. During the TICP validation exercise, there were difficulties, including misuse of shared channels and audio level issues preventing the establishment of a gateway patch.

**Recommendations:**
- **Expand Interoperability Methods:** Expand methods of interoperability to include more than commercial services like cellular telephones.
- **Regular Testing and Exercises:** Regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional communications interoperability resources to improve operational proficiency.
- **Include Interoperability in Exercises:** Add communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

### Technology Overview

The St. Louis UA is served by a mix of conventional VHF, UHF, and 800 MHz trunked systems. Approximately 80% of public safety users operate in the VHF band. The County of St. Louis uses a conventional VHF system, while the City of St. Louis operates an 800 MHz trunked system. St. Clair County is transitioning to a countywide P25-compliant, 800 MHz, trunked system. The most common method of interoperability is sharing channels in the VHF band, with some agencies using console patches. Three interoperable communications initiatives are underway, including the deployment of a “network switch” in the city of St. Louis, the development of a high-capacity microwave backbone, and the creation of a permanent cross-banded system under the DoJ 25 Cities project.

### National Capital Region: Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

**Summary:**
- **Governance:** Advanced Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Advanced Implementation
- **Usage:** Advanced Implementation

**Governance: Advanced Implementation**

Interoperability in the National Capital Region (NCR) UA is overseen by a hierarchy of formalized committees, headed by the Senior Policy Group at the executive level. The Washington Council of Governments’ Joint Police and Fire Communications Committee addresses specific technical and operational policies. Agreements among agencies are largely in place and are being compiled, with steps taken to ensure regular review. An established strategic plan for voice communications is being updated to include wireless data communications and additional state and federal agencies. The NCR UA has successfully used funding to address regional communications interoperability needs, notably through the joint acquisition and implementation of a cache of 1,250 NCR radios.

**Recommendations:**
- **Federal Involvement:** Investigate means to more formally involve federal agencies and define their roles and responsibilities.
- **Systematic Process:** Establish a systematic process to develop and review agreements (e.g., usage agreements, MOUs) at least every 3 to 5 years and after significant events or upgrades.
- **Support Statewide Interoperability:** Build on the UA’s success to support statewide interoperability throughout Virginia and Maryland.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Advanced Implementation**

The policies for use of the NCR UA shared systems, the Metropolitan Interoperability Radio System (MIRS) fixed gateway system, and the NCR radio cache are well-established and effectively documented in the TICP. The UA used the TICP to enhance and disseminate these policies to all included agencies. The UA also documented communications assets using the CASM tool. NIMS/ICS has been in place for more than a year and is proficiently used, particularly by the fire community. NIMS/ICS was effectively used during the TICP validation exercise, including the successful deployment of the Communications Unit and Communications Unit Leader (COML).

**Recommendation:**
- **Continued Training and Exercises:** Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance for all participating first responder agencies.

**Usage: Advanced Implementation**

The NCR UA conducts multidiscipline and multijurisdictional communications across the area daily. The well-established use of shared systems by primary first responders and the proficiency in using MIRS and the regional radio cache for outside agencies were seamlessly demonstrated during the TICP validation exercise. The UA verified that personnel could achieve interoperable communications using fixed gateways with responders from Prince George’s County, which does not use an 800 MHz system. Communication was also achieved with multiple state and federal agencies.

**Recommendation:**
- **Future Exercises:** Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises and include agencies outside the defined UA.

### Technology Overview

The NCR UA has 25 separate communications systems serving public safety agencies in the District of Columbia, northern Virginia, and Maryland. Most suburban northern Virginia and Maryland public safety agencies (except those in Prince George’s County, Maryland) use separate but interconnected 800 MHz Motorola SmartZone™ systems. Regional interoperability is primarily achieved through shared systems, fixed gateways, shared channels, talk groups, and cached radios. Fixed gateways interconnect the NCR Police Mutual Aid Radio System, the Fire Mutual Aid Radio System, and National Public Safety Policy Advisory Committee channels. Mobile gateways are used on an incident-specific basis. The NCR UA anticipates migrating existing radio systems to a P25-compliant system, with Alexandria and Arlington, Virginia, and Prince George’s County, Maryland, expected to upgrade their systems. Other jurisdictions will need to make similar upgrades to ensure effective communications. In the long term, the NCR UA is considering expanding to include Baltimore, Maryland, and Richmond, Virginia, requiring the extension of regional radio systems and interoperability capabilities.

### Omaha, NE: Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

**Summary:**
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Intermediate Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

**Governance: Intermediate Implementation**

The Omaha UA works well together, though few formal processes are in place. Agreements consist of a combination of formal and informal partnerships, and the governing body referenced in the TICP does not have formal state or federal participation. The TICP process highlighted the need for a strategic plan, and Omaha officials have begun this development. Regional leaders have made communications interoperability a funding priority, using general funds and bonds for equipment and operations. The UA is encouraged to consider long-term funding strategies beyond the current bond initiative to achieve interoperability objectives.

**Recommendations:**
- **Formalize Participation:** Formalize state (i.e., Nebraska Emergency Management Agency) and federal (e.g., FBI, Department of Defense) participation within the UA’s communications groups.
- **Regular Meetings and Recruitment:** Continue to meet regularly and proactively recruit new participants from additional agencies representing various levels of government and public support disciplines.
- **Establish Agreements:** Identify all necessary participants and establish regional agreements (e.g., MOUs) as appropriate.
- **Strategic Plan Development:** Encourage full development of the strategic plan and obtain acceptance from all participants.
- **Enhance Funding Strategy:** Consider enhancing the regional communications interoperability funding strategy to include long-term (3 to 5 years) funding sources beyond bonds and grants.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Intermediate Implementation**

The TICP provides the first regional communication SOPs for the Omaha UA, built on prior procedures among individual agencies. Although most agencies were represented in the TICP, few steps have been taken to disseminate these policies. The shared system and console patch infrastructure have simplified interoperability policies, but formal SOPs remain critical. The Omaha UA did not consistently demonstrate SOPs during the TICP validation exercise (e.g., deactivation of gateway patches did not follow TICP procedures). The UA is in the process of implementing NIMS/ICS and has had some problems integrating these command policies.
