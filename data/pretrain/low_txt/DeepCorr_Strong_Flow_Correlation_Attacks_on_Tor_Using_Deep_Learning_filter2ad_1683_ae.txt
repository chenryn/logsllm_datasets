**Traffic Analysis and Flow Correlation Attacks**

Malicious Autonomous Systems (ASes) can exploit their control over significant portions of internet traffic, placing them in an ideal position to perform flow correlation attacks. To mitigate this threat, several proposals have suggested new relay selection mechanisms for Tor that reduce the likelihood of interception by malicious ASes [2, 5, 39, 51, 68, 70]. However, none of these alternatives have been deployed by Tor due to their negative impacts on performance, costs, and privacy. We argue that designing practical AS-aware relay selection mechanisms for Tor is a promising avenue to defend against flow correlation attacks.

### 7. Conclusions

We have designed a flow correlation system, called DeepCorr, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems in correlating Tor connections. DeepCorr leverages an advanced deep learning architecture to learn a flow correlation function tailored to Tor's complex network, as opposed to previous works that used general-purpose statistical correlation metrics. Our results show that with adequate learning, DeepCorr can correlate Tor connections (and thereby break its anonymity) with accuracies substantially higher than existing algorithms, using much shorter lengths of flow observations. We hope that our work highlights the escalating threat of flow correlation attacks on Tor, particularly with the rise of advanced learning algorithms, and calls for the deployment of effective countermeasures by the Tor community.
