### Scanner Operation and Beep Codes
- **Startup:** The scanner beeps once upon startup.
- **Shutdown:** During shutdown, the scanner beeps three times.
- **Failure Modes:**
  - If there are any failure modes, the scanner will either beep continuously or not at all.

### Election Setup and Voting Process
- **Setup:**
  - Election judges set up the check-in tables, poll books, and voting booths.
  - The election started on time.
- **Voting Experience:**
  - The election proceeded smoothly with only minor glitches.
  - An SVST (Scantegrity Verification Support Team) member assisted polling officials in resolving an issue with their poll books (not provided by Scantegrity).
  - Some voters initially had difficulty using the scanner and privacy sleeve, requiring assistance from election judges who also faced some challenges.
  - After an explanation by the Chair of the Board of Elections, the use of the scanner improved significantly.

### Ballot Issues and Resolution
- **Scanner and Privacy Sleeve:**
  - A few ballots had issues with the privacy sleeve, which did not release the ballots properly. One ballot was significantly mangled but still scanned correctly.
  - Seventeen ballots had lines that prevented the scanner from reading the votes, and one ballot had manipulated alignment marks, making it unreadable.
  - Images of all unreadable scans were saved, allowing for manual entry of these votes.
  - Many of the seventeen problematic ballots had a line in the same location, suggesting a foreign substance on the ballot.
  - These issues did not affect the overall vote count.

### Random Ballot Selection and Verification
- **Random Selection:**
  - Ms. Coney randomly selected about fifty ballots, uniformly distributed across wards, and exposed the confirmation codes for all options.
  - Copies of each ballot were made and signed by the Chair of the Board of Elections.
  - Neither Ms. Coney nor SVST members interacted with voters during this process.

### Voter Turnout and Ballot Management
- **Increased Voter Turnout:**
  - Towards the end of the day, following NPR coverage, the polling station saw a significant increase in voter turnout, with long lines extending outside the polling room.
  - The SVST prepared to print more ballots, but this was not necessary. The number of printed ballots was nearly twice the number of voted ballots.
- **Absentee and Early Voting:**
  - Absentee and early voted ballots were scanned after the polls closed.
  - The scanners were then shut down, and the chief judge opened each lock box, set all USB sticks to read-only mode, removed two USB sticks (leaving the third with the scanning netbook), and re-locked the lock box.
  - Our team received one USB stick for the ERM (Election Result Management) system, while the other was kept by the city.

### Election Results and Announcement
- **Results Generation:**
  - At approximately 10 PM, trustees used Scantegrity code to generate results without provisional ballots.
  - The Chair of the Board of Elections announced the results to those present at the polling place, including candidates, their representatives, and voters. This announcement was also televised live by the local TV station.
  - Confirmation codes and the election day tally were posted on the Scantegrity website.

### Post-Election Activities
- **Final Results:**
  - On the next day, around 2 PM, results including verified provisional ballots were published.
  - Takoma Park representatives announced a tally without provisional ballots the night before and followed with the final tally that included verified provisionals.
  - The final Meeting 3 results were published on November 4th just before midnight.
  - Registered voters: 10,934; Votes cast: 1,728 (15.8%).
  - The city-certified final tally for each contest is provided in Table 1.

- **Hand Count and Certification:**
  - A hand count was performed by representatives from both the SVST and Takoma Park.
  - The Chair of the Board of Elections certified the results of the hand count to the City Council at 7 PM on November 5.
  - The hand count and the Scantegrity count differed slightly due to the ability of officials to better determine voter intent during the hand count.
  - For example, in the mayoral race, the scanner count was 646 votes for Schlegel, 972 for Williams, 15 for write-ins, and 90 uncast. The certified hand count totals were 664 for Schlegel, 1,000 for Williams, and 17 for write-ins.
  - The discrepancy was caused by voters marking ballots outside the designated areas, which, while not read by the scanner, are considered valid votes under Takoma Park law.

- **Post-Election Audit:**
  - During Meeting 4 on November 6 at 6 PM, trustees used Scantegrity-written code to reveal all codes on voted ballots and to verify everything for all non-spoiled or non-voted ballots.
  - Trustees responded to pseudo-random challenges generated by stock market results at closing on November 6.
  - All data was published on November 7th around 9 AM.
  - Dr. Adida and Dr. Zagórski independently confirmed that Scantegrity correctly responded to all digital challenges and that the tally computation audit data was correct.
  - Both made available independently-written code on their websites for voters and others to check the tally computation commitments.

- **Confirmation Codes and Complaints:**
  - The period for complaints regarding the election, including missing confirmation codes, expired at 6 PM on November 6.
  - The Scantegrity website recorded 81 unique ballot ID verifications, with about 66 (almost 4% of total votes) performed before the deadline.
  - The SVST was informed that at least a few voters checked codes on auditor websites.
  - Scantegrity received a single complaint from a voter who had trouble deciphering a digit in the code. The voter requested clearer printing of codes in the future.
  - All codes for all voted ballots were revealed after the dispute resolution period and verified by two independent auditors, Dr. Adida and Dr. Zagórski.

- **Print Audits:**
  - Dr. Zagórski provided an interface for Ms. Coney to check the commitments opened by Scantegrity in Meeting 4 against the candidate/confirmation-code correspondence on the ballots she audited.
  - In her report, she confirmed that the correspondence between confirmation numbers and candidates on all the printed ballots audited by her was correct.

- **Follow-Up:**
  - The Board of Elections and an SVST representative met several weeks after the election to discuss opportunities for improvement.
  - Both sides were largely satisfied with the election, and conversations have begun regarding the use of Scantegrity in the next municipal election in November 2011.

### Surveys and Observations of Voter Experiences
- **Timing Data:**
  - Two helpers, not part of the Scantegrity team, timed 93 voters as they completed the voting process.
  - Voting times ranged from 55 seconds to 10 minutes, with a mean of 167 seconds and a median of 150 seconds.
  - Older voters generally took longer than younger voters.
  - Most of the time was spent marking the ballot.
  - The average voting time was significantly faster than in the April 2009 mock election, where voters took approximately 8 minutes on average due to scanning delays.

- **Election Day Comments:**
  - As voters left the precinct building, members of the Scantegrity team and a usability expert solicited comments.
  - Common responses included "It was easy."
  - Many voters did not understand the online verification process and the need to write down the codenumbers.
  - Later in the day, verbal announcements were made to inform voters about the new system and the verification option, which seemed to have a positive effect.

- **Survey of Voter Experiences:**
  - Voters were invited to fill out two one-sided survey forms: a field-study questionnaire and a demographics questionnaire.
  - The field study asked voters about the voting system they just used, with most answers on a seven-point Likert scale.
  - Fifty-one voters wrote comments, often pointing out confusion about various aspects of the process but with no consistent theme.
