## What is Hybrid Cloud?
- **Definition:** A blend of on-premises infrastructure combined with cloud services.
- **Typical Setup:** On-premises infrastructure integrated with cloud-hosted infrastructure (IaaS) and services (SaaS).
- **Security Concerns:** Connection points between on-premises and cloud environments often lack adequate security measures.

### Hybrid Cloud Scenarios
- **On-Premises AD with Office 365 Services (SaaS):** 
  - Office 365 hosts mailboxes, while authentication is performed by on-premises Active Directory.
- **Cloud Datacenter:**
  - Extending the datacenter to the cloud using Azure and/or Amazon AWS (IaaS).
- **On-Premises AD with Cloud-Hosted AD as Resource Forest:**
  - Establishing a trust between on-premises AD and cloud-hosted AD.
- **Other Combinations:**

## The Cloud & Virtualization
- **Conceptual Understanding:** The cloud is effectively virtualization.
- **Cloud Provider Architectures:**
  - **Amazon AWS:** Uses XEN and more recently (2018) Amazon’s Nitro (based on KVM core kernel) to host VMs.
  - **Azure:** Leverages a customized version of Hyper-V (core) for Azure VMs.
  - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Uses KVM for virtualization.
- **Cloud Fabric:** Connects virtualization components with orchestration, storage, and networking.

## Compromising On-Premises Domain Controllers
- **Physical DCs:**
  - Physical access
  - Out-of-band management (e.g., HP iLO)
  - Check for port 2381 on servers for iLO web service (indicative of a security risk if accessible from the same network).

### Example Command:
```powershell
Test-NetConnection $IPAddress -Port 2381
```

- **Airbus Security Findings:**
  - New exploitation techniques allowing compromise of the host server OS through DMA.
  - RCE vulnerability in iLO4 feature enabling read-write access to host memory and injection of payloads into the Linux kernel.
  - Vulnerability in the web server to flash backdoored firmware.
  - Use of DMA communication channel to execute arbitrary commands on the host system.
  - Logic error (CVE-2018-7113) in the kernel code for integrity verification, exploitable to break the chain-of-trust.
  - Go scanner available to discover vulnerable servers running iLO: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/airbus-seclab/ilo4_toolbox)

- **Virtual DCs: VMware:**
  - Compromise VMware administration
  - Gain access to accounts with VMware access to virtual DCs
  - Compromise systems running vCenter (Windows or appliance)
  - Identify ESXi Root account password to compromise ESXi hosts
  - Directly connect to virtual DCs using the VIX API (via VMware Tools)

- **Virtual DCs: Hyper-V:**
  - Compromise members of the “Hyper-V Admins” group
  - Compromise the server hosting Hyper-V
  - Compromise local admin account on the Hyper-V server
  - Compromise accounts with GPO modify rights to the OU containing Hyper-V servers

## Cloud-Hosted/Managed Active Directory
- **Overview:**
  - AD environment provisioned per customer by the cloud provider
  - Fully managed AD by the cloud provider
  - Customer does not have Domain Admin rights or direct access to Domain Controllers
  - Available on Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform

### AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory
- **Configuration:**
  - 2 DCs running Windows Server 2012 R2
  - Default domain Administrator account in the “AWS Reserved” OU
  - First account “Admin” with full rights on the customer OU
  - Customer OU created with rights delegated to AWS Administrators
  - Default domain password policy, with the ability to modify 5 pre-created Fine-grained password policies
  - Decent DC auditing policy, but no Kerberos audit policies

### Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Managed AD)
- **Configuration:**
  - 2 DCs running Windows Server 2012 R2
  - Default domain Administrator account “dcaasadmin”
  - Initial admin account is an Azure AD account
  - Customer OUs: AADDC Computers & AADDC Users
  - 1 Fine-Grained Password Policy (FGPP)
  - Authenticated Users can add computers to the domain
  - Event auditing on Managed AD Domain Controllers not configured via GPO

### GCP Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory
- **Configuration:**
  - 2 DCs running Windows Server 2019 Datacenter
  - Default domain Administrator account disabled
  - 2nd domain admin account “cloudsvcadmin”
  - First account is customer-created (“setupadmin”)
  - Default domain password policy, with the ability to create Fine-grained password policies
  - Event auditing on Managed AD Domain Controllers not configured via GPO

### Common Themes in Managed AD
- No customer Domain Admin or Domain Controller rights
- Custom OUs provided for customer use
- Delegation groups provide AD component management capability
- Default Domain Password Policy, adjustable via Fine-Grained Password Policies
- Slightly different approaches to achieve similar capabilities

### Attacking Managed AD
- Determine the Managed AD environment (OU and group names)
- Focus on delegation groups and membership
- Identify default customer admin account
- Enumerate privileged group membership
- Managed AD typically used and managed by Application Owners who may not realize their rights
- DC auditing may not be configured to detect malicious activity

## Attacking Hybrid Cloud Components
