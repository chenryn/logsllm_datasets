### Scale Differences and Delay Behavior

It is noteworthy that each delay curve exhibits well-behaved characteristics beyond a certain point. These points correspond precisely to the inflection points in the rate curve, meaning that for a given value of κ, the effects of delay become problematic only when there are fewer than κ underutilized channels. This behavior appears to be a direct consequence of the simplified channel selection approach, as underutilized channels will almost always be available for sending data according to epoll, thus the implementation rarely needs to wait for additional channels to become available.

### High-Bandwidth Channels

Our final experiment aims to push the system and implementation to their limits to determine how long they can sustain near-optimal rates as the available bandwidth increases. Specifically, we seek to identify the point at which the bottleneck shifts from channel capacity to other factors. To achieve this, we return to the Identical setup and gradually increase the channel rate from 100 Mbps to 800 Mbps in increments of 25 Mbps. The multichannel rate is measured at each step using iperf, similar to the first experiment.

First, we set parameters κ = μ = 1 to fully maximize the multichannel rate. As shown in Figure 6, this configuration results in performance leveling off around 750 Mbps total, or when the individual channel capacity reaches approximately 150 Mbps. To complement this, we conduct another round of experiments with μ = 5 and varying values of κ, where the overall multichannel rate will be lower for the same total amount of traffic. Interestingly, even though the threshold has a minimal impact on the rate during normal operation, it significantly affects performance once the system and implementation are pushed to their limits. Large κ values cause the protocol to fall short of optimal much sooner than small values.

### Conclusion

Understanding the inherent privacy and performance trade-offs of any network privacy approach is crucial. In this work, we have presented a rigorous model of multichannel secret sharing protocols in real networks, including a corresponding privacy measure. From this model, we derived formulas and programs to calculate optimal privacy and performance metrics based on the properties of individual channels and the protocol parameters. Benchmarks on a reference implementation demonstrated the utility of our model, validated the accuracy of our analysis, and showed that multichannel secret sharing protocols can be efficiently implemented. Given these results, we can now make strong statements about the achievable privacy and performance of this class of network privacy protocols.
