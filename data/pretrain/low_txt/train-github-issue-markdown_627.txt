### Issue Description

When downloading the Flutter gallery app from the Google Play Store and opening the Date and Time picker example, the "OK" and "Cancel" buttons are not rendered correctly on small-screen devices due to the screen size.

I was able to reproduce this issue in my own implementation of the Date and Time picker demo.

### Additional Information

This issue only occurs on small-screen devices. When I open the Date Picker dialog on a device with a screen size of 5 inches or larger, everything is rendered correctly.
