**Abstract:**
Using a comprehensive set of Internet cartography methods and novel applications, we have conducted an extensive active measurement-driven study of the topology of U.S. regional access ISPs. We employed state-of-the-art techniques in various combinations to address the geographic scope, scale, and architectural complexity of these networks. In addition to vantage points from research platforms, we utilized public WiFi hotspots and mobile devices in transit to gain the necessary visibility for thorough mapping. Our observations revealed diverse approaches to aggregation and redundancy across links, nodes, buildings, and hierarchical levels. One key finding is the significant variation in latency from some Edge COs to their backbone COs, which has implications for end users of cloud services. Our methods and results can inform future analyses of critical infrastructure, including disaster resilience, the persistence of the digital divide, and the challenges facing 5G and edge computing.

## 1 Introduction
Regional access networks are a critical part of an ISP's infrastructure, bridging millions of users' last-mile access links to the nearest backbone routers, often hundreds of miles away, to reach the Internet. These networks strategically aggregate traffic to balance reliability and performance against the cost of providing connectivity over large regions. Fiber cuts or other hardware failures can lead to large-scale outages spanning neighborhoods, counties, or entire states. To mitigate such risks, ISPs provide redundancy within and across levels of aggregation. However, regional access networks are often opaque, making it challenging for researchers to quantitatively study their role in the evolving ecosystem.

In this paper, we present a measurement-driven exploration of regional access network topologies, focusing on aggregation and redundancy as the foundations of scalability. Building on advances in Internet measurement methods and tools over the past two decades, we first demonstrate the ability to infer the topologies of different regional access networks using only active measurements. We then conduct measurement campaigns to compare how major U.S. wireline (Comcast, Spectrum, AT&T) and mobile (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile) ISPs incorporate aggregation into their regional access network topologies. Our analysis reveals insights into the propagation of large correlated last-mile link failures, sources of edge computing latency, and performance limitations of metro-area fiber networks.

## 2 Background
### 2.1 Evolution of Access Networks
Access networks must balance reliability and performance against the cost of deploying and operating infrastructure. An additional challenge is achieving these goals at scale, in terms of market size and geographic scope, while adapting to technological and industry changes. The primary architectural mechanism for achieving this scale is aggregation. Regional networks aggregate traffic through a hierarchy of Central Offices (COs) and routers. Edge COs aggregate traffic from thousands of last-mile links, while Aggregation COs (AggCOs) aggregate traffic from multiple Edge COs. Backbone COs (BackboneCOs) aggregate traffic from AggCOs and sometimes Edge COs, providing transit services via the ISP's backbone network or other ISPs.

### 2.2 Mobile Access Networks
Mobile regional access networks leverage wireline access networks to provide mobile Internet access over a large geographic area. These networks consist of two halves: the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the mobile packet core. Mobile devices communicate wirelessly with base stations, which aggregate user traffic over existing wireline networks and hidden mobile-specific AggCOs. These AggCOs bridge the RAN to the mobile packet core, which terminates at one or more Packet Gateways (PGWs) in Edge COs. Edge COs in mobile networks are the primary location for deploying low-latency, high-bandwidth IP-based edge services.

All mobile Internet traffic traverses both the wireline regional access networks and the mobile packet core. To understand the aggregation and redundancy of mobile networks, it is essential to also understand the wireline network. By mapping the wireline providers' regional networks, we gain insight into the limitations of the RAN. In this paper, we mapped both the wireline and mobile networks of AT&T and the cable providers that provide backhaul for all major mobile carriers.

### Mapping Wired Networks
In 2002, Spring et al. developed Rocketfuel to construct router-level maps of individual networks using focused traceroutes, alias resolution, DNS hostnames, and BGP routing tables [45]. They used Rocketfuel to map ten transit networks, and subsequent researchers used these maps to study interior routing [41], path inflation [64], and methodological discussions [68, 75]. In 2007, Mao et al. developed NetworkMD [43], an approach to diagnose and debug network problems by combining active and passive measurements.
