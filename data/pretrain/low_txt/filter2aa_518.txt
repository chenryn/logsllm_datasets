#### Quotations
- **Attorney General Janet Reno (May 25, 2000)**
  - "Let's do something about it."
  - "I think any time you expose vulnerabilities, it's a good thing."

- **John L. Moss, CEO of S2 Security (January 1, 2004)**
  - "When hackers put viruses on your home computer, it's a nuisance; when they unlock doors at your facility, it's a nightmare."

### EDAC Technology Overview
- **Trends**
  - Shift from proprietary solutions to IP-based systems
  - Convergence with IP video and other building systems (e.g., HVAC, elevators, alarms)
  - Cost savings, integration, and increased capabilities
- **Vendors**
  - S2 Security
  - Honeywell
  - HID Global Vertx
  - Ingersoll-Rand
  - Bosch Security
  - Reach Systems
  - Cisco Systems (Richards Zeta)
  - Brivo
  - DSX Access
  - RS2 Technologies
  - Synergistics

### EDAC Deployment
- **Common Observations**
  - Managed by building facilities personnel
  - Often neglected or forgotten
  - Long lifecycles (5-10 years)
- **Distance from IT Security**
  - Physical security is often not considered part of IT
  - Patching, upgrades, and maintenance are frequently overlooked
  - Policies for passwords and logging are not always applied
  - Third-party local service contractors often handle hardware configuration

### EDAC Architecture
- **S2 Security NetBox**
  - **Overview**
    - Developed by S2 Security
    - Over 9,000 systems installed worldwide (schools, hospitals, businesses, LEA facilities, etc.)
    - Sold under multiple brand names:
      - Linear (eMerge 50 & 5000)
      - Sonitrol (eAccess)

### S2 Security NetBox: Information Gathering
- **Preparation and Information Gathering**
  - S2 Security case studies and press releases
  - Online research (Google, Lexis-Nexis, ABI-Inform)
  - Example: Determined from http://tinyurl.com/s2mysql
    - Uses Samba client, MySQL (MyISAM), Lineo Linux distribution (similar to Zarus)
    - Processor: ARM Core IXP 425 chip @ 533 MHz
    - Development time: 15 months from design to first customer shipment
    - S2 Security had limited experience with open source
    - MySQL stores reports, user information, customized features, facility diagrams, and more

### NetBox Components
- **HTTP Server**
  - GoAhead Webserver (TCP/80)
  - Poor choice with multiple CVEs (e.g., CVE-2003-1568, CVE-2002-2431)
  - No vendor response to reported vulnerabilities

- **MySQL/Postgres**
  - MySQL server listening on TCP/3306
  - Outdated SQL versions (MySQL 4.0 for version 2.X, Postgres for 3.X)
  - End of download for older versions

- **NmComm**
  - Service listening on TCP/7362
  - Performs multicast discovery of nodes
  - Coded by S2 Security, patent issued December 15, 2009

- **FTP/Telnet**
  - Cleartext protocols used for management and DB backups
  - Poor security documentation

- **Features**
  - Additional options (elevators, HVAC, burglar, VoIP)
  - Increases complexity and attack surface
  - View floorplans

### Vulnerabilities and Exploits
- **Unauthenticated Reset (VU#571629)**
  - Remote, unauthenticated factory reset via crafted URL

- **Unauthenticated Access to Backup (VU#228737)**
  - Unauth attacker can download DB backups
  - Nightly DB backup is hardcoded CRONJOB
  - Predictable naming convention with timestamp
  - Backup DB contains all system data

- **Extraction of Administrator Hash**
  - Affects NetBox 2.X (MySQL) and 3.X (Postgres)
  - Trivial to crack, giving admin access

- **Pwnage: Doors and Cameras**
  - Open any door (immediately or scheduled)
  - Backup file contains IP camera information (name, IP address, admin username, and password)

- **Pwnage: DVRs**
  - User/pass to DVRs in backup DB
  - Poor setup guides recommend default credentials

### Fingerprinting
- **Remote Identification**
  - MAC OID registered to S2 Security
  - Nmap service fingerprint submitted (nmap 5.20)

### Recommendations
- **For Vendors**
  - Conduct security evaluations on products
  - Provide secure deployment guides
  - Tighten third-party integration
  - Improve logging, HTTP, FTP, and Telnet security

- **For Customers**
  - Demand better security from vendors, resellers, and service contractors
  - Manage EDAC like any other IT system (patching, change management, security reviews)
  - Isolate eMerge system components (VLANs, MAC auth, VPN, restrict IP, etc.)
