### Background: PLCs Turn Rogue
- **Stuxnet (Anonymous Author)**
  - Exploited a vulnerable Siemens Step7 engineering station/WinCC HMI client.
  - Injected a rogue control program and tampered with HMI outputs.
- **Rogue7 (Biham, et al.)**
  - A Python script impersonating an engineering workstation.
  - All S7 PLCs from the same model and firmware version share the same key.
- **Doors of Durin (Abbasi, et al.)**
  - Achieved arbitrary code execution on the Siemens S7-1200 PLC bootloader.
  - Identified that Siemens S7 firmware uses the Adonis kernel.
- **The Race to Native Code Execution in PLCs (Keren)**
  - Demonstrated remote arbitrary code execution on Siemens S7-1500.
  - Exploited a memory protection vulnerability to escape the control program sandbox.

### ICS Architectures Are Evolving
- **New Requirements from PLC Vendors:**
  - Agility and flexibility.
  - Preservation of existing IP and technology.
  - Solution: Software PLCs.
- **New PLC Architecture:**
  - **Generic Functions:** GP OS – updatable and flexible, using standard hardware.
  - **Legacy Functions:** Proprietary OS – closed and hardened.
  - **Virtualization:** Isolation and separation.

### Siemens ET 200SP Open Controller
- **Introduction:** January 2015.
- **Features:**
  - Combines PLC functionality with a PC-based platform using virtualization.
  - Isolation between Windows and control logic.
  - Supports Windows updates and reboots without interrupting control logic.
  - The controller continues to work even if Windows crashes.
- **Device Under Test (DUT):** CPU 1515SP PC2.

---

### The Quest: Investigating the Boot Process
- **Boot Sequence:**
  - BIOS → GRUB Bootloader → 1st Stage VMM → 2nd Stage VMM → SWCPU → Windows Embedded.
- **Observations:**
  - VMM binary, GRUB configuration, and CPU.elf files are accessible from Windows.
  - Read-write by admin.

---

### Finding the ELF Decryption Code
- **Decompression/Decryption Function:**
  - Found through static analysis, which was very complex.
  - Debugging using the Int3 debugger.
  - Successfully decrypted the swcpu in memory but could not export it for further analysis.

---

### Stealing the Vault
- **Success!**
  - Moved the vault to a powerful attack environment.
  - **Execution Environment:**
    - VMM is an x86 binary, run on standard Linux (Ubuntu).
    - Challenges: different execution environments, hypervisor vs. user mode, proprietary VMM runtime library vs. standard CRT.
    - Solution: Dynamic binary instrumentation using Intel Pin.
    - Replaced VMM functions and added custom code to decrypt the VMM.

---

### Unlocking the Vault
- **Decryption Loop:**
  - Instrumented the VMM to start from a specific instruction, replace VMM functions, and add custom code.
  - Used Intel Pin to run the VMM decryption.
- **Environment Setup:**
  - Input, stack, temp buffer, function pointers, and output buffer.
- **Revealed Firmware:**
  - Initial research shows that SWCPU is based on the Adonis Linux.
  - Contains more than the basic kernel and PLC code, including standalone libc.so, openSSL, and a tar archive with a MIPS ELF.

---

### Mitigations
- **Separate the Key from the Code:**
  - Prevents decryption with PIN.
- **Secure Boot, TPM, DM CRYPT:**
  - Prevents INT3 debugging and static code reversing.
  - Prevents Ubuntu booting.

---

### Customer Impact
- **Firmware Leakage:**
  - Exposes the full Simatic S7 product line via exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
  - An attacker with admin rights on the Windows VM can replace the PLC firmware with a crafted rogue firmware.
  - Full details shared with Siemens.

---

### Summary
- **Siemens PLC Market Share (2019):** 31%
- **Deployment:**
  - Power plants, water facilities, transportation systems, nuclear reactors.
- **Issues:**
  - Firmware leakage.
  - Exposure to known unpatched vulnerabilities.
  - Design flaw with no easy solution.

---

### Message to the Community
- **Secure Binding to Hardware and Large-Scale Key Management:**
  - Tough operational problems.
  - Challenge to the security and research community.
  - Important as ICS architecture shifts from walled garden to open and cloud-oriented environments.
  - A solution is crucial.

---

### Message to Customers
- **Assets Owners:**
  - Demand the security you need from ICS vendors.
  - Generic security features may not meet your full requirements.
