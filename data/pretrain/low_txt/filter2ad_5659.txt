## Abstract

Graphical password methods rely on human experience and hand selection, which are not well-quantified metrics, to evaluate the appropriateness and confusion of challenge images. In this paper, we propose using Chinese characters for authentication, as their entropy can be up to 9.65 bits, significantly higher than other languages. We present an algorithmic framework for user authentication and provide empirical results from a study conducted at a university. The advantages of our framework include low storage overhead, no reliance on personal experience or hand selection, no predefined dictionary of likely choices, and ease of reference by personal-style cues.

Our study shows that the number of participants who prefer our framework is comparable to those who favor graphical passwords, with a notable difference in the backgrounds of the two groups. This suggests that our framework and graphical passwords can serve as candidate authentication methods for users with different backgrounds. Additionally, we measure user preferences for patterns and find a slight preference for the 3×3 grid over the circle pattern. While the proposed framework prescribes the challenge characters, users have the option to define their own challenge characters.

## 1. Introduction

Password-based authentication is the dominant technology for confirming the identities of legitimate users. Textual passwords, composed of upper- and lower-case letters, digits, and special symbols, are widely used in conventional authentication systems. As an alternative, graphical password methods have been proposed to enhance usability [8, 1, 5, 6, 7].

Graphical authentication techniques are particularly useful for non-typewritten input devices such as mice, styluses, and touch screens. A classic example is PassFaces [8], where users select faces they are attracted to. To avoid exposure of selected images, Dhamija and Perrig [5] used random art to generate abstract images. Kawagoe et al. [6] proposed a tag association-based graphical password, where a set of images is determined from a large collection using user-registered pass-terms.

The type of images used strongly influences security. For example, if photographs are used, users' choices may be correlated with race or gender. Even for non-photographic images, attributes like attractiveness, intensity, hue, and background color can influence choices. Graphical password methods require collecting and storing candidate images, which relies heavily on human experience and manual control to filter out simplistic or weak images. There is no well-quantified metric to evaluate the appropriateness and confusion of images, making it challenging to distinguish pass images from decoy images.

In this paper, we propose using Chinese characters for authentication, with an entropy of up to 9.65 bits [12], much higher than other languages. We present an algorithmic framework for authentication and conduct an empirical analysis at a university. The advantages of our framework include:

- Low storage overhead (only 2 bytes per character)
- No reliance on personal experience or hand selection
- No predefined dictionary of likely choices
- Ease of reference by personal-style cues (e.g., Pinyin, stroke count, words)

Empirical analysis shows that the number of participants who prefer our framework is similar to those who favor graphical passwords, with a significant difference in the backgrounds of the two groups. Our framework and graphical passwords can serve as candidate authentication methods for users with different backgrounds. We also measure user preferences for patterns and find a slight preference for the 3×3 grid over the circle pattern.

## 2. Our Algorithmic Framework

Chinese characters are logograms used in the writing of Chinese and some other Asian languages, constituting the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world. There are tens of thousands of Chinese characters, with 2,500 common characters and 1,000 less-common characters [2]. The entropy of Chinese characters is 9.65 bits [12], significantly higher than other languages (e.g., 4.03 bits per letter in English [10]). Frequency lists of Modern Chinese characters are readily available [11].

In our framework, a user's password is composed of an iteration of \( k \) (e.g., \( k = 6 \)) rounds, each containing a distinct set of \( n > 1 \) characters. For instance, \( n = 9 \), and characters are placed randomly in a 3×3 grid. Characters in the same round should have similar frequencies to avoid trivial or weak characters. We recommend using the top 9k most commonly used Chinese characters \( c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{9k} \) [11]. Each Chinese character requires only 2 bytes of storage.

During password setup, the user is shown \( k \) successive 3×3 grids, each containing 9 characters. For the \( i \)-th round (\( i = 1, \ldots, k \)), characters \( c_{9i-8}, \ldots, c_{9i} \) are presented. The user selects \( p \) (e.g., \( p = 2 \)) characters from each round as elements of their password. Therefore, characters are unique and do not appear more than once for a given user.

During authentication, \( m \leq k \) out of \( k \) sets of characters are shown to the user. The characters of each set are the same as in the registration step but in randomly permuted positions. If the user correctly identifies all the characters belonging to their password, they are authenticated successfully.

Our framework does not rely on personal experience or hand selection but on the statistical analysis of the Chinese language. The characters selected can be easily referenced by personal-style cues (e.g., Pinyin, stroke count, words) to distinguish pass characters from decoy characters. Using \( m = 3 \), \( n = 9 \), and \( p = 2 \) provides \( \binom{9}{2}^3 \) combinations, implying a 1 in 46,656 chance of guessing the password at random. For comparison, the four-digit PIN used globally on ATM networks has a 1 in 10,000 chance of being guessed [8].

Our framework includes countermeasures against observer attacks. First, the positions of characters in each round are randomized. Second, the size of the user's password \( k \) is larger than the number of challenge rounds \( m \), and the probability that an observer sees the same characters after one observation is \( \frac{1}{\binom{k}{m}} \), making impersonation difficult. Lastly, combined with masking (characters in a grid are overwritten with a common mask foreground) and limited authentication attempts, it is extremely difficult for an observer to learn the password as the user clicks on them.

While the proposed framework prescribes the challenge characters, it can be implemented using user-defined challenge characters. In this case, the user first registers their password, and the framework chooses decoy characters with similar frequencies for each character from the password.

## 3. User Acceptance

Our framework is useful when input devices do not permit typewritten input. To check user acceptance, we conducted a pen-and-paper survey to gather statistical information about the framework and patterns.

### 3.1 Participants

We recruited 98 Chinese undergraduate and graduate students from different departments of a university. 51 participants were from Liberal Arts colleges (Humanities and Social Science, Foreign Languages, Business, and Social Development), and 47 were from Science and Engineering colleges (Information Science and Technology, Resources and Environmental Science, Finance and Statistics, Life Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry). All data collected was anonymized.

### 3.2 Results

A main purpose of our user study was to determine user acceptance of the proposed framework. We gave participants two options: our framework and a similar framework with images (e.g., faces). 45 out of 98 participants chose our framework, with 14 from Science and Engineering colleges and 31 from Liberal Arts colleges. The remaining 53 participants chose images, with 33 from Science and Engineering colleges and 20 from Liberal Arts colleges (Figure 3).

**Figure 3: Participant Preferences**
- **Framework Choice**: 31.11% from Science and Engineering colleges, 68.89% from Liberal Arts colleges
- **Image Choice**: 37.74% from Liberal Arts colleges, 62.26% from Science and Engineering colleges

While the number of participants choosing the proposed framework and those opting for images is similar, the backgrounds of the participants differ significantly. Participants from Liberal Arts colleges are twice as likely to choose the framework, while those from Science and Engineering colleges prefer images. Thus, our framework and graphical passwords can be used as candidate authentication methods for users with different backgrounds.

Next, we identified the preference of participants for authentication patterns. We compared two patterns: (a) 3×3 grid and (b) circle (Figure 4). 55 out of 98 participants chose the grid pattern, with 49.09% from Science and Engineering colleges and 50.91% from Liberal Arts colleges. The other 43 participants chose the circle pattern, with 41.86% from Science and Engineering colleges and 58.14% from Liberal Arts colleges. There is a slight preference for the 3×3 grid over the circle pattern.
