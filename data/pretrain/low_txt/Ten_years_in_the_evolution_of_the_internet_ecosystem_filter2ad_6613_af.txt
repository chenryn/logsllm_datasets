### Attractiveness and Repulsiveness in Provider Dynamics

The relationship between the attractiveness at time \( t \) and the repulsiveness at time \( t + l \) (where each lag \( l \) corresponds to 3 months) reveals a significant pattern. For a large number of providers, strong attractiveness is typically followed by strong repulsiveness after a period of 3 to 9 months. Several factors may contribute to this effect. We hypothesize that some providers initially attract many new customers through advertising and promotions. However, these providers may struggle to retain their new customers, leading to significant repulsiveness a few months later. This could be due to customers frequently changing providers, especially in the case of Content and Access Hosting Providers (CAHPs), or due to follow-up advertising and promotions from competitors.

### Conjectures on the Evolution of Peering

Given the limited visibility of peering links through RouteViews and RIPE routing tables, we do not delve deeply into the detailed evolution of peering relationships in this paper. Instead, we present some preliminary results, which should be considered as unproven conjectures about the evolution of peering. These observations will need to be re-examined in future studies when the research community has better access to peering link data.

**Figure 20: Median Number of Peers for Each AS Type Over Time**

- **LTP (Large Transit Provider)**
- **CAHP (Content and Access Hosting Provider)**
- **STP (Small Transit Provider)**
- **EC (Edge Customer)**

The median peering degree is used instead of the average because the latter is heavily influenced by a single LTP provider (AS13237) with over 200 peers. ECs and STPs have median peering degrees of zero. Notably, the median peering degree of CAHPs has increased significantly since 2003, from 2 to 10. This increase is expected for LTPs, as they require many peering links for global reachability. CAHPs, on the other hand, are incentivized to create many peering links to reduce their transit costs paid to upstream providers, thereby increasing their revenues from content, access, or hosting fees.

**Figure 21: Number of PP Links of the Most Common Types**

- **CAHP-CAHP**
- **LTP-CAHP**
- **EC-CAHP**
- **STP-CAHP**
- **LTP-LTP**
- **STP-LTP**
- **STP-STP**

The number of peering links involving CAHPs (CAHP-CAHP, EC-CAHP, STP-CAHP) increased significantly between 2001 and 2005, with a persistent growth rate thereafter. The exception is LTP-CAHP links, which have remained almost constant since 2003. The highest growth rate is observed for CAHP-CAHP and CAHP-STP links, likely because content and hosting providers aim to get as close as possible to the destinations or sources of their traffic. Another observation is that the number of STP-LTP peering links has remained almost constant over the last 5-6 years, possibly due to the restrictive peering policies of most large transit networks. These findings support the anecdotal evidence that content and access providers are becoming dominant players in the peering ecosystem, primarily due to their open peering policies, while transit providers have selective or restrictive policies, peering out of necessity rather than choice.

### Related Work

Over the past decade, significant research has been dedicated to characterizing the AS-level topology of the Internet. One of the most cited papers, by Faloutsos et al. [15], argued that the Internet AS-level topology is "scale-free." However, Chen et al. [9] challenged this view, showing that the degree distribution, while heavy-tailed, does not strictly follow a power-law distribution. Tangmunarunkit et al. [34] suggested that the heavy-tailed degree distribution could be attributed to the heavy-tailed AS size distribution. Most previous measurement studies focused on static topological properties, such as degree distribution and clustering, and did not examine the evolution of the topology over time.

A recent study by Leskovec et al. [22] measured the average degree and effective diameter of the Internet AS graph, concluding that the AS graph is densifying. Other studies [23, 32] examined the evolution of the Internet topology from 1997 to 2001, observing exponential growth in the number of ASes and links. Siganos et al. [32] noted that a rich-get-richer form of preferential attachment leads to exponential growth in the number of edges. Magoni et al. [23] found exponential growth in the number of ASes and links during the same period.

The observation that the degree distribution follows a power-law led to the development of several topology generation models, such as the preferential attachment model by Barabasi et al. [2]. Extensions and variants of this model were proposed [3, 36, 39], and Park et al. [28] compared different growth models for Internet topology. Recent work has attempted to incorporate economic factors into the evolution of the Internet topology, as seen in [31, 35].

Earlier descriptive models received criticism for focusing on degree distribution and clustering while ignoring important features like hierarchy and the presence of different types of links (transit versus peering). Newer models view the Internet topology as the outcome of optimization-driven activities of individual ASes. Chang et al. [6, 7] modeled AS interconnection practices and the behavior of ASes in different economic roles. A recent editorial [17] emphasizes the need to further understand the dynamics of the AS topology. Norton [25] and Economides [13] discuss the economic and competitive interests influencing peering and transit connectivity in the Internet.

Several studies have highlighted the incompleteness of topologies inferred from publicly available routing data [8, 10, 18, 24, 37]. Zhang et al. [37] and He et al. [18] have made notable contributions to capturing more of the Internet topology. Zhang et al. [38] investigated the impact of route monitor selection on topology inference and AS path prediction, finding that publicly available BGP data are reasonably accurate for these applications. Oliveira et al. [27] addressed the challenges of distinguishing genuine link births and deaths from those caused by routing transients.

### Conclusions

Our study measures the evolution of the AS-level topology over the last 10 years, focusing on growth, rewiring, four distinct economic/business classes of ASes, and customer-provider links. Key findings include:

- The Internet has experienced two growth phases: an initial exponential phase up to mid/late-2001, followed by a linear phase.
- The average path length remains constant, indicating network densification.
- Approximately 75% of link births are associated with existing ASes, and about 80% of link deaths are due to rewiring.
- ECs contribute most to overall growth, while the average multihoming degree has increased significantly for STPs, LTPs, and CAHPs.
- CAHPs are the most active in rewiring, while ECs are the least active.
- We introduced metrics for attractiveness and repulsiveness, finding positive correlations with customer degree and a 3-9 month lag between strong attractiveness and repulsiveness.
- The number of attractors and repellers shows an increasing trend.
- Regional growth indicates that the European market for access/hosting/content and transit providers will soon surpass North America, reflecting a shift in the Internet ecosystem.

We have provided conjectures to explain the observed densification, high activity of CAHPs, and the incentives driving AS connections. Future work should focus on validating these conjectures and modeling the provider and peer selection process for each AS type to better understand the dynamics of the AS-level topology and the impact of various strategies.
