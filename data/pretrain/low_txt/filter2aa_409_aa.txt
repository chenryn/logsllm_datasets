## Agenda

1. **Why Microsoft Exchange Server?**
2. **Exchange Server Attack Surface Overview**
3. **From a Domain Account to Arbitrary Mailbox Takeover**
4. **From a Domain Account to Exchange Server RCE**
5. **Lateral Movement & Privilege Escalation**
6. **Conclusion & Takeaways**

### Why Microsoft Exchange Server?

- **One of the most famous mail servers in the world**
  - Stores large amounts of sensitive corporate information (emails, attachments, contacts, calendars, etc.)
- **Highly integrated with Microsoft Active Directory**
  - Authentication
  - Mailbox, User, and Group management
  - Exchange Server configuration
- **High-privileged AD objects**
  - Installed by Enterprise Admins/Schema Admins
  - The Exchange Windows Permissions group has WriteDACL rights on the Domain object (fixed in 2019)

### Exchange Server Attack Surface Overview

- **Client Access Services**
  - HTTPS endpoints
  - POP3, IMAP, SMTP
  - Unified Messaging
- **HTTPS endpoints**
  - OWA, ECP, RPC, EWS, MAPI, API, ActiveSync, PowerShell, Autodiscover, OAB

### Historical Vulnerabilities

- Most historical vulnerabilities exist in ASP.NET code running on IIS Server.

### Architecture and Attack Surface

- **Front End:**
  - HTTP Proxy
  - OWA/ECP/MAPI/EWS/â€¦
- **Back End:**
  - IIS Server
  - Windows Server
  - Exchange Server
  - Other services (POP3, IMAP, SMTP, UM, etc.)

### From a Domain Account to Arbitrary Mailbox Takeover

#### The UNC Feature

- Many ECP operations/PowerShell Cmdlets support the UNC feature:
  - `Export-ActiveSyncLog`
  - `Import-ExchangeCertificate`
  - `New-ExchangeCertificate`
  - `Export-ExchangeCertificate`
  - `New-MailboxExportRequest`
  - ...
- Triggers SMB connection:
  - Exchange Server runs with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
  - NTLM authentication with XLAB\Exchange1$ (Machine Account)

#### What Can We Do with the SMB Connection / NTLM Authentication?

- **NTLM Overview:**
  - Embedded challenge-response style authentication protocol
  - Protocols using NTLMSSP: NTLM over SMB, HTTP, LDAP, MSRPC, etc.
  - NTLM relay attack

#### NTLM Relay Attack 101

- **Victim:**
  - Authenticates to an attacker-controlled service
- **Attacker:**
  - Relays the NTLM authentication to a vulnerable service
- **Attacked Target:**
  - Accepts the relayed NTLM authentication

#### Exploit

- **Trigger NTLM authentication of XLAB\Exchange1$**
- **Preconditions for NTLM relay attack:**
  - Authentication: Are there any vulnerable services as targets?
  - Authorization: Does the machine account have special privileges on these services?

### Exchange Server (on-premise) Endpoints

- **Endpoints and Description:**
  - `/owa`: Outlook Web App, Web Form
  - `/ecp`: Exchange Control Panel, Web Form
  - `/mapi`: MAPI over HTTP, Kerberos, NTLM
  - `/EWS`: Exchange Web Services, Kerberos, NTLM
  - `/Rpc`: Outlook Anywhere, Kerberos, NTLM, Basic
  - `/Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync`: ActiveSync, Basic
  - `/Powershell`: Exchange PowerShell Cmdlets, Kerberos
  - `/Autodiscover`: Client application configuration, Kerberos, NTLM, Basic
  - `/API`: REST API, Kerberos, NTLM
  - `/OAB`: Offline Address Book, Kerberos, NTLM

#### NTLM Reflection

- **Can we relay the NTLM authentication back to Exchange1?**
- **CVE-2018-8581 SSRF + NTLM reflection:**
  - Disabled NTLM reflection on Exchange Server
  - Remove `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\DisableLoopbackCHECK`

### Two Exchange Servers

- **Common situation in enterprise environments:**
  - Load balancing with multiple Exchange Servers
  - Relay NTLM authentication to HTTPS endpoints on another Exchange Server

### Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA)

- **Channel Binding:**
  - NTLM authentication protection on TLS channel
  - Calculates a Channel Binding Token (CBT) based on the TLS certificate and the user's NT hash
- **Default Configuration:**
  - CBT in NTLMSSP over SMB are all zero by default
  - EPA is disabled on these Exchange endpoints by default

### Exchange Server Machine Account

- **ExtendedRights ms-Exch-EPI-Token-Serialization:**
  - All members of the Exchange Servers group have token serialization rights on all Exchange Servers in the AD

### EWS Impersonation

- **EWS creates security access tokens based on:**
  - Users with token serialization rights can impersonate other Exchange users
- **Impersonation:**
  - Set `UserSid` in `SerializedSecurityContext` to impersonate other users
  - Use LDAP or `impacket/exchanger.py` to get `UserSids`
  - Supports almost all operations supported by Outlook (FindFolder, FindItem, GetItem, CreateItem, GetAttachment, UpdateInboxRules, InstallApp, etc.)

### The Printer Bug

- **Found by @tifkin_ from SpecterOps:**
  - Print System Remote Protocol (MS-RPRN)
  - Printer Spooler Service enabled by default
  - `RpcRemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotificationEx` API: `pszLocalMachine` can be set to a UNC path
  - Any domain users/computers can force REMOTESERVER$ to establish SMB connections with any machine

### The Exploit Chain

- **Exchange1:**
  - XLAB\attacker triggers XLAB\Exchange1$ NTLM authentication
  - Relays the NTLM authentication to EWS on Exchange2
  - Logs in successfully as XLAB\Exchange1$
  - Impersonates PI:EMAIL
  - Reads mails, downloads attachments, sends mails, etc., as PI:EMAIL

### Patches

- **April 2021 Patch:**
  - Breaks the exploit chain by no longer allowing machine accounts to log in to Exchange endpoints
- **Fixed in July Patch Tuesday:**
  - Assigned CVE-2021-33768

### Conclusion

- **Arbitrary Mailbox Takeover:**
  - A normal domain account can escalate to full mailbox access and potentially RCE on Exchange Server.
