# Exploitation of Heap Vulnerabilities in VMware

## Introduction
This document outlines a method for exploiting heap vulnerabilities in VMware, specifically focusing on overwriting the `mRecvBuf` total size and defeating Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). The exploitation process involves sophisticated heap manipulation techniques to achieve arbitrary address writes.

## Exploitation Steps

### Step 1: Overwrite the Total Size of `mRecvBuf`
- **Objective**: Overwrite the `TotalSize` field of `mRecvBuf`.
- **Method**: Use the function `e1000_overflow_write_size_0xa0(0x130)` to perform an out-of-bound write.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  e1000_overflow_write_size_0xa0(0x130);
  ```

### Step 2: Defeat ASLR
- **Objective**: Bypass ASLR to reliably exploit the vulnerability.
- **Method**:
  - **Heap Padding with Info-Set**: Use `info-set guestinfo.XXX A*0xa0` to pad the heap with known data.
    ```c
    info-set guestinfo.XXX A*0xa0;
    ```
  - **Overwrite Heap Memory**: Overwrite the heap memory after the DnD Buffer with known patterns.
    ```c
    DnD Buffer
    BBBBB...
    AAAAA...
    Free
    AAAAA...
    Free
    DnD v3
    Free
    Free
    AAAAA...
    AAAAA...

    Free
    AAAAA...
    Free
    Free
    The leak heap
    BBBAA...
    Free
    Free
    ```
  - **Confirm Heap Leak**: Use `info-get guestinfo.XXX` to check if the overflowed heap can be leaked.
  - **Leak Vtable**: Continue overwriting the heap until the vtable of DnDv3 is leaked.
    ```c
    DnD Buffer
    BBBBB...
    BBBBB...
    BBBBB...
    BBBBB...
    BBBBB...
    DnD v3

    AAAAA...

    The leak heap
    BBBBB...
    struct DnD_V3 {
        void * vtable;
        ...
    }
    ```

### Step 3: Arbitrary Address Write
- **Objective**: Achieve arbitrary address write by overwriting `mRecvbuffer` in DnD v3.
- **Method**:
  - Overwrite the `mRecvbuffer` in DnD v3 with a fake structure.
    ```c
    DnD Buffer
    BBBBB...
    BBBBB...
    BBBBB...
    BBBBB...
    BBBBB...
    Fake DnD v3
    Free

    AAAAA...
    AAAAA...

    AAAAA...

    Free
    The leak heap
    BBBBB...
    struct DnDTransportBuffer {
        ...
        buffer = 0x41414141;
        totalSize = 0x1000;
        ...
    }
    ```

## Potential Problems
- **Failure Scenarios**:
  - **DnD Buffer Behind Structures**: If the DnD Buffer is located behind other structures, the overwrite may fail.
    ```c
    DnD v3
    Free
    Free

    Free
    Free
    Free
    DnD Buffer
    Free

    Free
    Free
    ```
  - **Allocated Chunk Before DnD v3**: If the chunk before DnD v3 is already allocated, the overwrite may fail.
    ```c
    Allocated
    DnD v3
    Free

    Free
    ```
  - **No Leak Chunk Between DnD v3 Buffer and Structure**: If there is no free chunk between the DnD v3 buffer and the DnD v3 structure, the leak may fail.
    ```c
    DnD Buffer
    DnD v3
    Free
    AAAAA...
    Free
    AAAAA...

    ```

## Conclusion
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - Even low-quality vulnerabilities can be exploited using sophisticated heap manipulation techniques.
  - Cracking VMware's virtual machine is becoming increasingly difficult due to:
    - Shallow and high-quality bugs being addressed by VMware and the research community.
    - Continuous removal of exploitation-friendly objects by VMware.
    - The need to understand internal mechanisms to exploit low-quality bugs.
