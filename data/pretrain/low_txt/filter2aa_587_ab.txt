### Importance of Data Sufficiency
It is crucial to note that the findings for individual justices carry varying weights. For a justice who rarely speaks during oral arguments or is new to the court, even a seemingly clear pattern may not warrant a strong conclusion due to insufficient data.

### Overview of Justices
This section provides an overview of the findings for each justice. The first part includes a scorecard with a brief numerical summary of the justice's record on the court. The second part presents an analysis of the oral argument data for cases in which the justice participated.

### Methodology
The oral argument transcripts identify the speaker of each utterance. For this analysis, no distinction was made between different types of utterances (e.g., questions, comments, jokes). It was assumed that every time a justice spoke, it was to ask a question. Questions were categorized into three classes based on the identity of the last party to speak: the petitioner, the respondent, or a current fellow justice. Questions directed at justices no longer on the court were excluded.

Cases where the justices' voting records or the advocates' roles were not available were also excluded from the analysis, as it would be impossible to link the justices' votes with their behavior during oral arguments.

### Anthony Kennedy
**Scorecard:**
- **Cases During Tenure:** 2057
- **Voted with the Majority:** 1802
- **Voted with the Minority:** 188
- **Did Not Participate:** 65
- **Majority Opinions Authored:** 214
- **Concurrences Authored:** 192
- **Dissents Authored:** 185
- **Joined Another Justice’s Opinion:** 169

**Discussion:**
Justice Kennedy's reputation as a swing vote is supported by his voting with the majority in over 87% of the 2,057 cases heard by the Supreme Court since his appointment. In 5-4 decisions, each of the five majority votes is equally decisive. Justice Roberts has a similar majority voting rate. The term "swing vote" must therefore imply a less predictable vote on policy or ideological grounds.

Of the 2,057 cases, 734 were included in the oral argument study. Over these cases, Justice Kennedy spoke 8,753 times: 4,378 times to the petitioner, 3,837 times to the respondent, and 438 times to another sitting member of the court. He is a very even-handed questioner, with only a slight bias in favor of speaking to the petitioner. His even-handedness extends to writing special opinions, with 51% concurrences and 49% dissents.

**Questioning Patterns by Vote:**
Justice Kennedy shows a slight tendency to ask more questions of the petitioner in cases where he votes for the respondent. However, this is not a reliable metric. For example, in *Maryland v. Pringle* (2003), he asked 20 questions of the petitioner and one of the respondent, and voted for the petitioner. Similarly, in *NASA v. FLRA* (1999), he voted for the respondent after asking the respondent 19 questions and the petitioner two.

At this level of analysis, Justice Kennedy remains one of the most inscrutable members of the court, as his questioning behavior does not reliably predict his vote.

### Antonin Scalia
**Scorecard:**
- **Cases During Tenure:** 2230
- **Voted with the Majority:** 1834
- **Voted with the Minority:** 383
- **Did Not Participate:** 13
- **Majority Opinions Authored:** 229
- **Concurrences Authored:** 341
- **Dissents Authored:** 382
- **Joined Another Justice’s Opinion:** 278

**Discussion:**
As the senior member of the court, Justice Scalia has left a substantial statistical trail. He consistently votes with the majority (82.3%) and is a prolific author of both dissents and concurrences. He has written more of each than he has majority opinions, making him the second most likely justice to submit a written opinion (42.9%).

Justice Scalia is an active participant in oral arguments, speaking 17,954 times across 754 arguments, averaging nearly 24 questions per argument. He shows a slightly stronger tendency to side with the petitioner (60.6%). In cases where he votes for the petitioner, his questioning pattern is almost a mirror image of his questioning in cases where he votes for the respondent.

**Questioning Patterns by Vote:**
Most justices tend to ask more questions of the party they will not support. For Justice Scalia, this is a reliable indicator. In the 40 cases where he asked more than 25 questions of the petitioner, he voted for the respondent only 10 times. Conversely, in the 40 cases where he asked more than 27 questions of the respondent, he voted for the petitioner only 7 times. In 67 cases where the questions were evenly distributed, he voted for the petitioner 60 times (89.5%). Thus, Justice Scalia's vote can be inferred with some confidence from the distribution of his questions.

### Clarence Thomas
**Scorecard:**
- **Cases During Tenure:** 1546
- **Voted with the Majority:** 1230
- **Voted with the Minority:** 298
- **Did Not Participate:** 21
- **Majority Opinions Authored:** 153
- **Concurrences Authored:** 222
- **Dissents Authored:** 296
- **Joined Another Justice’s Opinion:** 283

**Discussion:**
Justice Thomas's speech patterns at oral arguments are limited. He has spoken in only 12 cases, asking a total of 37 questions, with 30 directed at the respondent. This small sample size makes it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions. In cases where he spoke, he voted for the petitioner 8 times (75%), but this may not be indicative of any particular bias.

However, Justice Thomas is highly vocal in written opinions, having written an opinion in 671 of the 1,525 cases in which he participated (44%), making him the court's leader in submitting written opinions.

### Elena Kagan
**Scorecard:**
- **Cases During Tenure:** 34
- **Voted with the Majority:** 10
- **Voted with the Minority:** 4
- **Did Not Participate:** 20
- **Majority Opinions Authored:** 3
- **Concurrences Authored:** 0
- **Dissents Authored:** 2
- **Joined Another Justice’s Opinion:** 5

**Discussion:**
Justice Kagan's record is notable for her high rate of non-participation (58% of cases). Of the 14 cases she has heard, only 13 were eligible for the oral argument study. As the court's newest member, there is limited data, but her behavior differs from that of her colleagues.

She has voted for the respondent in eight of the 13 cases studied, while most justices show a preference for the petitioner. Justice Kagan tends to ask more questions of the petitioner regardless of her vote. While it is too early to claim significance, she is bucking the court's trends.

Interestingly, despite her high non-participation rate, she has written three majority opinions out of ten majority votes, indicating a dynamic where fewer cases lead to more frequent opinion assignments.

### John G. Roberts, Jr.
**Scorecard:**
- **Cases During Tenure:** 325
- **Voted with the Majority:** 285
- **Voted with the Minority:** 27
- **Did Not Participate:** 7
- **Majority Opinions Authored:** 38
- **Concurrences Authored:** 17
- **Dissents Authored:** 25
- **Joined Another Justice’s Opinion:** 33

**Discussion:**
Justice Roberts spoke in 265 cases suitable for inclusion in this study. He voted for the petitioner 173 times (65%) and for the respondent 93 times (35%). He asked a total of 2,475 questions of petitioners (average of 9.34) and 2,777 questions of respondents (average of 10.48).

**Questioning Patterns by Vote:**
In cases where Justice Roberts votes for the respondent, he asks an average of 11.1 questions of the petitioner and 9.66 of the respondent. In cases where he votes for the petitioner, he asks an average of 10.9 questions of the respondent and 8.4 of the petitioner. This supports the theory that he has a mildly antagonistic questioning style, asking more questions of the party against whom he will vote. This correlation is weaker than observed with other justices.

Justice Roberts sides with the majority in over 90% of his votes, slightly higher than Justice Kennedy's percentage. The number of questions he asks is weakly correlated with the outcome of the case, though this does not establish a causative relationship. Litigants may still find it useful to count the questions he asks of each side to gauge the potential outcome.

### Ruth Bader Ginsburg
