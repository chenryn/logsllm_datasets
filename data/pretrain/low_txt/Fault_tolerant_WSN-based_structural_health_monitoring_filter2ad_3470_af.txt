### Faulty Sensor Node Handling and Mode Shape Interpolation

After the faulty sensor nodes have been removed, the corresponding mode shape values for these nodes no longer exist. The absence of these values in the mode shapes can adversely affect the accuracy of damage detection. To address this, cubic spline interpolation [22] is employed to estimate the missing mode shape values. Since this technique is only applicable to 2D curves, the mode shapes for the upper and lower sides of the middle span are interpolated independently.

For the upper side sensors, the mode shape values for the identified faulty sensors #3, #9, #15, and #27 are estimated. For the lower side sensors, the mode shape values for sensors #36 and #48 are estimated. Figures 20 and 21 illustrate the interpolated mode shapes and their curvatures for the upper and lower side sensors, respectively. Damage is located at points with high mode shape curvatures. In Figure 20, damage is detected at locations corresponding to #12 and #13. In Figure 21, damage is detected near #41 and #42. These damage locations align well with the simulated damage locations.

### Implementation

The effectiveness of the proposed methods is tested through a real-world implementation. To meet the high requirements of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications, a specialized wireless sensor node called the SHM mote was designed. This tailored sensor node includes an Imote2, a sensor board, and a radio-triggered wakeup & synchronization unit (see Fig. 22(a)).

The test structure consists of 12 floors, with SHM motes deployed on each floor to monitor the structure's horizontal accelerations under hammer strikes (see Fig. 22(b)). Although the SHM motes can form a complete network under normal conditions, we use the network topology shown in Fig. 22(c) to test the clustering algorithms. The SHM motes run a modified version of TinyOS and are configured to sample the accelerometers at a frequency of 256 Hz.

Structural damage is simulated by releasing a support ring on the third floor (see Fig. 22(b)). Additionally, sensors on the 5th and 8th floors are loosened to generate faulty readings. The goal is to detect the structural damage in the presence of these two faulty sensor nodes.

### Clustering and Damage Detection

The first step is clustering. Given the relatively simple lab structure, the 12 deployed SHM motes can be considered part of the same substructure. Using the two clustering methods proposed, the same clusters are generated and illustrated in Fig. 22(d). This clustering is performed offline on a laptop computer before the test.

Through a gateway mote connected to the computer, cluster heads (CHs) in the two clusters (#4 and #9) are designated. Each SHM mote extracts the natural frequency set and sends it back to the corresponding CH and the gateway. Figure 23(a) shows the identified natural frequency sets in the first cluster. Figure 23(b) illustrates the standard deviation (std(Ns)) over the first four iterations in the frequency matching process. It is observed that std(Ns) drops sharply after deleting sensor #5, while remaining stable after deleting other sensors. Thus, sensor #5 is labeled as faulty. Another faulty sensor node, #8, is also successfully detected in another cluster.

- (b) Std(Ns) after each iteration

After detecting and isolating the faulty sensor nodes, the mode shapes for each cluster are estimated using the ERA algorithm. In this test, mode shapes corresponding to the natural frequency set {4.12 Hz, 21.4 Hz} are extracted in both clusters and sent back to the gateway. Here, the mode shapes at the healthy sensor nodes are first interpolated and then double-differentiated to obtain the mode shape curvatures. Figure 24 illustrates the mode shape curvatures. By examining the curvatures, damage is detected at #3, which matches the correct damage location.

### Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant scheme for WSN-based SHM systems. This scheme can detect structural damage even in the presence of faulty readings. Through clustering, the redundancy in the natural frequency sets is minimized. Faulty sensor nodes are detected via natural frequency matching, and the mode shape curvatures of the remaining nodes are used to detect structural damage. The proposed scheme efficiently integrates faulty sensor detection and structural damage detection, allowing for the disambiguation of structural damage from sensor faults. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated through both simulation and real-world implementation.
