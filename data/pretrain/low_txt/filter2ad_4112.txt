## Abstract
The 6th ACM Cloud Computing Security Workshop (CCSW 2014) was held in conjunction with the 21st ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2014) on November 7, 2014, at The Scottsdale Plaza Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona, USA. Cloud computing, a new paradigm for utility computing, involves the aggregation of virtualized resources managed by service providers and dynamically allocated to tenants on demand. While this paradigm transforms the IT industry and enables cost-effective business applications, it also raises significant security and privacy challenges. The CCSW workshop series focuses on these challenges and the research opportunities they present.

## 1. Introduction
Cloud computing has revolutionized information and communication technologies, redefining how data is stored, retrieved, processed, and shared. It provides an elastic, scalable, and highly virtualized environment, enabling modern applications through large-scale, parallelized architectures. Although the economic benefits of cloud computing are well-recognized, this model introduces unique security and privacy requirements. As cloud computing becomes more widely adopted, ensuring the security, privacy, and availability of operations, components, and systems is increasingly critical.

## 2. Scope
CCSW 2014 is the sixth in a series of workshops organized in conjunction with the ACM Computer and Communications Security (CCS) conference. The workshop aims to explore the security and privacy challenges posed by cloud computing and to foster the development of practical solutions. It provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss and exchange ideas on all aspects of cloud-centric and outsourced computing security.

### Topics of Interest
- Practical cloud security solutions
- Practical cryptography for cloud security
- Secure cloud resource virtualization
- Network virtualization
- Secure data management outsourcing
- Practical privacy and integrity for outsourcing
- Foundations of cloud-centric threat models
- Secure and verifiable computation outsourcing
- Remote attestation mechanisms in clouds
- Sandboxing and VM-based enforcements
- Trust and policy management in clouds
- Secure identity management mechanisms
- Cloud-aware web service security paradigms
- Cloud-centric regulatory compliance
- Business and security risk models in the cloud
- Cost and usability models and their interaction with security in clouds
- Scalability of security in global-size clouds
- Trusted computing technology and clouds
- Binary analysis of software for remote attestation and cloud protection
- Cloud network security (DoS defense, IDS)
- Security for cloud programming models
- Energy/costs/efficiency of security in clouds

## 3. Program
CCSW 2014 received thirty-six high-quality submissions, of which twelve were selected by the program committee through a rigorous review process. Each paper was reviewed by three or four members of the program committee, depending on whether a program committee member was a co-author. The accepted papers cover a wide range of areas in cloud security, including secure cloud storage, secure computation, key management, and cloud system security. The workshop also includes four invited sessions, three keynote talks, and one memorial session.

### Keynote Talks
- **Joanne Martin**, CISO and VP for IT Risk, IBM: "Securing Cloud Environments for Enterprise Computing"
- **David McGrew**, Fellow, Cisco: "Privacy vs. Efficacy in Cloud-based Threat Detection"
- **Bryan D. Payne**, Director of Security Research, Nebula: "Reducing the Cost of Security in the Cloud"

### Memorial Session
Organized by Elaine Shi, this session celebrates the life and contributions of Emil Stefanov to cloud computing security. Titled "Emil Stefanov: Bridging the Theory and Practice of Cloud Computing Security," the session features discussions by Srini Devadas, Ari Juels, and Zygmunt Pizlo on Emil's most impactful work.
