# Encoding Policy

The encoding policy in Azure Data Explorer defines how data is encoded, compressed, and indexed. This policy applies to all columns of stored data. A default encoding policy is applied based on the column's data type, and a background process automatically adjusts the encoding policy if necessary.

## Scenarios

We recommend maintaining the default policy unless specific scenarios require customization. Modifying the default column encoding policy can help fine-tune the performance and cost (COGS) trade-off. Here are some examples:

- **String Columns for Specific Value Queries**: The default indexing for `string` columns is optimized for term searches. If you only query for specific values in the column, you can reduce COGS by simplifying the index using the `Identifier` encoding profile. For more information, see [the string data type](../query/datatypes-string-operators.md).

- **Non-Query Fields or Slow Search Requirements**: Fields that are never queried or do not require fast searches can disable indexing. Use the `BigObject` encoding profile to turn off indexes and increase the maximum value size in dynamic or string columns. This is useful for storing HLL values returned by the `hll()` function.

## How It Works

Changes to the encoding policy do not affect data that has already been ingested. Only new ingestion operations will be performed according to the updated policy. The encoding policy can be set at the column level, table level (affecting all columns in the table), or database level.
