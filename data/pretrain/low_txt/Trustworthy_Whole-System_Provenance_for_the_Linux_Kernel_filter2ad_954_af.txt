### Provenance Collection and Information Flow Control

Provenance collection is a form of information flow monitoring that, while related to traditional areas of study, is fundamentally distinct. Due to space constraints, our detailed discussion on Information Flow Control (IFC) systems is provided in our technical report [8].

### Conclusion

In this work, we have introduced LPM, a platform for creating trusted, provenance-aware execution environments. Our system imposes as little as 2.7% performance overhead on normal system operations and can respond to queries about data object ancestry in tens of milliseconds. We have utilized LPM as the foundation for a provenance-based data loss prevention system that can scan file transmissions to detect the presence of sensitive ancestors in just tenths of a second. The Linux Provenance Module Framework represents a significant advancement for both provenance- and security-conscious communities.
