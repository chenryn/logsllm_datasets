# Analysis of Network Topology Generators: Degree-Based vs. Structural

## 4. Link Value Rank Distribution

### Figure 4: The link value rank distribution (x-axis on linear scale)
- **(a) Canonical**
- **(b) Measured**
- **(c) Generated**

#### Normalized Link Rank
- **0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1**

#### Topologies
- **Mesh, Random, Tree, AS, RL, PLRG, Tiers, TS, Waxman**

#### Observations
From these groupings, we make two important observations:
1. **Structural Generators and Hierarchy**:
   - The structural generators (e.g., Tiers, TS) construct a much stricter form of hierarchy than is present in the measured graphs. This suggests a possible explanation for why they do not qualitatively match the measured networks by our topology metrics (Section 4).
   
2. **PLRG and Hierarchy**:
   - PLRG qualitatively models the hierarchy present in AS and RL graphs, even with policy routing accounted for. This resolves our paradox to some extent. Although not explicitly hierarchically constructed, PLRG does capture the moderate hierarchy in our measured networks. A question remains: what aspect of PLRG graphs is responsible for this hierarchy? We address this in the next subsection.

## 5. Correlation between Link Usage and Degree

To better understand the hierarchical structure of these graphs, we compute the correlation between a link’s value and the lower degree of the nodes at the end of the link. A high correlation between these two indicates that high-value links connect high-degree nodes. Figure 5 shows the correlations for the nine networks under consideration.

### Figure 5: Correlation between minimum degree and link value

#### Key Points
- **PLRG**: 
  - Extremely high correlation.
  - No explicit structure built into the graph.
  - High-value links connect high-degree nodes.
  - Long-tailed power-law degree distribution leads to numerous high-degree nodes (hubs), and high-value links (backbone links) connect these hubs.
  
- **Random Graph**:
  - Relatively high correlation.
  - No explicit structure.
  - Limited degree distribution, resulting in limited hierarchy.
  
- **Tree**:
  - Lowest level of correlation.
  - Hierarchy comes from the deliberate structure, not the degree distribution.
  - Leaves have lower degrees, and associated links have the lowest values.
  
- **AS and Waxman**:
  - Relatively high correlation.
  
- **Mesh, TS, Tiers, and RL**:
  - Relatively low levels of correlation.
  - Hierarchy in structural generators (Tiers, TS) arises from the deliberate placement of links, similar to the Tree.
  - Higher correlation in AS compared to RL, suggesting that the hierarchy in AS is more related to node degrees, while in RL it is due to deliberate link placement.

### Summary
- **Degree-based Generators**:
  - High correlation between link value and node degree.
  - Hierarchy arises from the long-tailed degree distribution.
  
- **Structural Generators**:
  - No such correlation.
  - Hierarchy arises from explicit construction.
  
- **RL Graph**:
  - Less correlation, indicating deliberate construction despite similar link value characteristics to PLRG.

## 6. Discussion

We began this paper by questioning the widely accepted belief that degree-based generators, by matching the degree distribution of the Internet, are superior to structural generators. We argued that it is more important for topology generators to capture the large-scale structure of the Internet rather than just reproducing local properties like the degree distribution. Our goal was to determine which family of generators—structural or degree-based—better captures these large-scale properties.

### Preliminary Results
- **Degree-based Generators**:
  - Capture the large-scale structure of measured networks well according to our metrics.
  - Significantly better than structural generators.
  - Hierarchy in measured networks is looser and less strict, well captured by degree-based generators.
  - Hierarchy arises from the long-tailed degree distribution, with backbone links connecting high-degree nodes.
  
- **RL Graph**:
  - Hierarchy is not highly correlated with degree, indicating deliberate link placement.
  
- **AS Graph**:
  - Higher correlation with degree, suggesting hierarchy is more related to node degrees.

### Conclusion
These results should not be interpreted as obviating the use of structural generators. Our focus has been on large-scale structures, and smaller topologies (less than 100 nodes) may benefit from structural generators. Structural generators might also be more appropriate for models incorporating bandwidth, topology, or geography.
