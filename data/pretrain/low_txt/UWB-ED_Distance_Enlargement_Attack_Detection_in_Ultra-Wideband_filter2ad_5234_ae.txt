# UWB-ED: A Technique for Detecting Distance-Enlargement Attacks in UWB Ranging Systems

## 1. Introduction
Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging systems are vulnerable to distance-enlargement attacks, where an adversary attempts to manipulate the perceived distance between two devices. This paper introduces UWB-Enhanced Detection (UWB-ED), a technique designed to detect such attacks. UWB-ED is deployable on existing off-the-shelf receivers and does not require additional infrastructure.

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Probability Model
The probability of an adversary's failure is calculated using a probabilistic model, as shown in Figure 15. The scenarios are run with specific parameters {α, β, r} as indicated in the figure captions. For example:
- **Figure 15(a)**: α = 20, β = 204
- **Figure 15(b)**: α = 15, β = 158

### 2.2 Simulation Results
Simulations validate the probabilistic model, showing that the simulated probabilities follow similar patterns and are within the same range. The results indicate that channel conditions, such as path loss, noise, and multipath interference, do not significantly affect the system's performance and security.

## 3. Attack Scenarios
### 3.1 Adaptive Attacks
An adversary can adapt its attack strategy by dynamically adjusting the number of pulses (k) based on the resultant energy. However, this attack fails because the adversary cannot control the resultant pulse phase. Injecting excessive energy into Binβ exceeds the threshold Γ, while injecting into Binα does not guarantee annihilation due to unpredictable phases.

### 3.2 Varying Energy Levels
To achieve perfect signal annihilation, an adversary might inject a single high-energy pulse instead of multiple low-energy pulses. However, multiple pulses in Binβ have a higher chance of evading the Robust Code Verification check, and any leftover energy in Binα will be counted towards the overall aggregate, thus hindering the adversary's efforts.

### 3.3 Influencing Γ through Distance Shortening
Instead of directly enlarging distances, an adversary might first mount a distance-reduction attack to trick the devices into using a higher Γ. It is essential to complement UWB-ED with distance-reduction detection techniques to ensure accurate distance verification.

### 3.4 Influencing the Number of Pulses, n
An adversary can inject a low stream of noise-like energy, but this reduces the amount of energy it can use strategically to prevent code detection. Since Γ is set beforehand, it is not influenced by the adversary.

## 4. Integration with Standards
### 4.1 IEEE 802.15.4z
The IEEE 802.15.4z enhanced impulse radio task group is defining physical layer improvements for secure and precise ranging. UWB-ED is a potential candidate for enlargement detection in 802.15.4z, adhering to the low pulse repetition frequency (LRF) mode and supporting non-coherent receivers up to 100 meters.

### 4.2 5G New Radio
The 3GPP technical specifications groups are designing 5G New Radio technology, which aims to include secure and precise ranging. UWB-ED can be integrated with 5G, allowing for beamforming and coherent receivers, and achieving long distances without the transmission power restrictions of UWB.

## 5. Conclusion
UWB-ED is the first known technique to detect distance-enlargement attacks against standard UWB ranging systems. It is readily deployable for current off-the-shelf receivers and requires no additional infrastructure. Evaluation shows that the verification code structure prevents signal annihilation and allows for longer symbol lengths, making UWB-ED a suitable candidate for practical applications, such as in 802.15.4z and 5G.
