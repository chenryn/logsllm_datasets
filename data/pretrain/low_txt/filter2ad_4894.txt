## Abstract
This workshop summary provides a brief overview of the "Architecting Dependable Systems" workshop, held in conjunction with DSN 2007. The primary goal is to foster cross-fertilization between the dependability and software architecture communities. We believe both communities will benefit from clarifying previously tested approaches, whether successful or not, to avoid reinventing the wheel.

## 1. Introduction
The workshop continues an initiative that began five years ago, bringing together the international communities of dependability and software architectures. The first workshop on Architecting Dependable Systems was organized during ICSE 2002. Since then, six workshops have been organized, and three books have been published [1]. This series has proven to be a fertile ground for both communities to clarify previous approaches, promoting new research areas while avoiding redundancy.

The main focus of this series is to address the structuring, modeling, and analysis of dependable software systems at the architectural level. During DSN 2007, the underlying theme will be "Architecting Critical Infrastructures."

## 2. Architecting Dependable Systems
A significant challenge is building dependable systems from existing undependable components and systems that were not originally designed to interact with each other. These components and systems may not provide access to their internal designs and implementations and can evolve independently of the overall system. Therefore, the delivery of correct service and the justification of this ability must be obtained from these components and systems.

Architectural representations are effective in understanding broader system concerns by abstracting away from system details. Thus, there is a trend to address dependability at the architectural level rather than late in the development process. Reasoning about dependability at the architectural level can be approached from different perspectives:

- **Architectural Description Languages:** These, or a combination of different notations, can be used to model systems' architectures in terms of their components and connectors. Adaptors can also be included to prevent architectural mismatches.
- **Verification and Validation Techniques:** Model checking, theorem provers, and fault injection are employed to ensure that faults have been removed from the architectural representation. Traditional testing and inspections are also performed to verify that the implementation fulfills the architectural specification.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Since it is difficult to remove all faults from a system, provisions must be made at the architectural level to tolerate residual faults. This includes structuring rules and incorporating existing fault-tolerance techniques into architectural abstractions.
- **Architectural Evaluation:** The impact of architectural decisions on system failure should be analyzed. Architectural fault injection and stochastic modeling are some of the means used and being developed for this purpose.

## 3. Workshop Objectives and Topics
The aim of the workshop is to bring together the dependability and software architecture communities to discuss the state of research and practice in addressing dependability issues at the architectural level. We invite submissions from both industry and academia on all topics related to software architectures for dependable systems. These include, but are not limited to:

- **Rigorous Design:** Architectural description languages, formal development, architectural views, support for evolution, integrators (wrappers) for dependability, fault assumptions, and patterns.
- **Verification & Validation:** Architectural inspection techniques, theorem proving, type checking, model checking, architecture-based fault injection, conformance testing, and simulation.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Redundancy and diversity at the architectural level, confinement, monitoring, dynamically adaptable architectures, exception handling, architectural mismatches, and support for self-healing, self-repairing, and self-stabilizing systems.
- **System Evaluation:** Assurance-based and run-time checks of dependability models, tradeoffs between dependability and cost, and architectural support for adaptable fault tolerance.
- **Enabling Technologies:** Model-driven architectures, component-based development, aspect-oriented development, and middleware.
- **Application Areas:** Safety-critical systems, critical infrastructures, mobile systems, service-oriented architectures, and embedded systems.

## 4. Workshop Program

### 4.1. Keynote Speaker
Professor Wolfgang Emmerich, head of the Software Systems Engineering group at University College London, will be our keynote speaker. He is well-known for his work on middleware-based distributed software architectures and will speak on "The Dependability of Web Service Architectures."

### 4.2. Architecting Critical Infrastructures
This year, we will focus on the theme of critical infrastructures. Public health, economy, security, and quality of life heavily depend on the resiliency of various critical infrastructures, including electrical power, telecommunications, transportation, and more. Addressing current and future problems in these sectors is of paramount importance. A considerable amount of time will be devoted to this topic, with discussions centered around this area.
