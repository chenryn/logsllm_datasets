## Abstract

Intrusion detection is an area of increasing concern in the Internet community. In response, numerous automated intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been developed, both commercial (e.g., Real Secure) and open-source (e.g., SNORT). However, there is currently no standardized way for these IDSs to communicate with each other or with a common manager.

To address this issue, the Intrusion Detection Working Group (IDWG) was chartered under the auspices of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). IDWG has published specifications for a standard alert format (IDMEF) and a standard transport protocol (IDXP). These specifications, however, remain largely theoretical until they are adopted by the community. This forum will discuss issues related to the community adoption of the IDWG specifications, with a particular focus on their implementation and use.

### IDMEF Overview

IDMEF (Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format) is a message format designed for IDS-generated alerts, using XML as the underlying encoding. The alert format includes fields for all the important information found in the current set of alerts generated by a large subset of available intrusion detection systems. Only through implementation and experience will the community be able to determine if the IDMEF specification is both complete and reasonable.

### IDXP Overview

IDXP, the IDWG transport protocol, is a specific implementation of a new IETF application-level protocol, BEEP (RFC 3080). Implementation experience is needed to convince the community that IDXP is appropriate as a transport protocol.

### Forum Agenda

The forum will begin with a quick overview of the IDMEF and IDXP standards. This introduction will be followed by presentations from implementers and vendors discussing their experiences with both IDMEF and IDXP. The presentations will focus on:

- The reference implementation of IDMEF
- The reference implementation of IDXP
- The IDMEF plugin for SNORT
- The development of an IDMEF-based IDS manager
- Related commercial activities
