### Improved Text

To ensure that devices are on the same local network, it is essential to have a measurement tool that combines the user-friendliness of existing web-based tools with the precision of command-line tools. The web-based tool should reliably record the time for a single round-trip and potentially reduce Windows-specific overhead and noise by leveraging the W3C Navigation Timing API [1]. This API provides web applications with detailed information about the time taken for each stage of an HTTP query-response pair. However, its use is contingent on server permissions, which are currently not granted by RIPE Atlas anchors and probes. We plan to discuss this possibility with the RIPE team. Additionally, we will address the privacy concerns associated with active geolocation from web applications, as this capability could be considered a privacy leak in web browsers. We intend to engage with browser vendors on this issue.

RIPE Atlas anchors typically reside on subnetworks with more stable and less congested connectivity to the global backbone compared to their local counterparts. This can lead to overestimation of the distance packets can travel from an anchor, based on round-trip time measurements to other anchors. While overestimation only increases uncertainty in predicted locations, underestimation can result in failure (as discussed in Section 5.1). Quantifying this source of error is crucial.

We are considering integrating additional measurement constellations, such as the CAIDA Archipelago [6] and PlanetLab [37], into our landmark set. This would enable us to compare delay-distance relationships across different constellations and within a single constellation, thereby investigating the degree of overestimation. These additional constellations would also enhance our landmark coverage outside Europe and North America. Although these constellations are primarily concentrated in the "developed world," each new landmark significantly improves sparse networks [16].

### Uncertainty and Continents

Uncertain prediction regions may span multiple countries or even continents. Since a prediction region is always contiguous, we expect uncertainty among groups of neighboring countries, but which groups? We briefly examine this question with a pair of confusion matrices, one for continents and the other for countries. All data is for the proxies, not the crowdsourced test hosts.

**Figure 22: Confusion matrix among continents**

**Figure 23: Confusion matrix among countries. Blue tinting marks groups of countries on the same continent.**

The lines separating continents are somewhat arbitrary. For this analysis, we chose to include Mexico with Central America, Turkey and Russia with Europe, all of the Middle East with Africa, and all of Malaysia and New Zealand with Oceania.

Intercontinental uncertainty is as expected: Europe/Africa/Asia, Asia/Oceania/Australia, North/Central and to a lesser extent South America. The country matrix, however, reveals that just about every country within a continent can share a prediction region; the exceptions are more interesting. Many southern African countries seem more likely to be confused with Asia than their neighbors, and not just the Indian subcontinent, but all the way to Japan. Similar effects appear for Oceania. This may reflect neighboring countries or islands in these areas not being directly connected, only through a more developed hub.
