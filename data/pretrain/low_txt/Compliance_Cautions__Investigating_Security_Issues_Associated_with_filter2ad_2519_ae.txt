### Enhancing the Overall Environment

E4, similar to E1, commented that he could only assess CIP 007-6 if the standard was followed precisely as written, with no additional considerations (Appendix B). Given his broader understanding of the compliance framework, E4 rated each issue as less likely to occur. 

One of the issues E4 rejected pertains to the loophole in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 concerning patch management. E4 stated that "each item in the [system] baseline needs a source identified or evidence that a source no longer exists." In his experience, he had never encountered an external source that could provide a trusted, proprietary patch. However, E4 acknowledged that if a component is no longer supported or a source no longer exists, it is highly likely that the component will remain unpatched against future publicly-disclosed vulnerabilities.

### Log Retention Issue

E4 confirmed the log-retention issue we identified in Section 4.3, attributing the known gap between log retention and investigation windows to two primary factors. First, the specification accounts for the limited log retention capacity on most devices within a Bulk Power System (BPS) environment. Second, most administrators and BPS owners are unwilling to connect to and aggregate event logs on an external platform. Adding an additional device for logging increases the number of devices an attacker can exploit and introduces another potential target for financial sanctions.

### Responsibility for Tasks

E4 also confirmed the risks associated with not specifying a responsible party for tasks, a trend our researchers identified, and referenced the Duke Energy fine as an example. He noted that the best additional defense for mitigating the issues we identified is to upgrade system components to more modern devices that can implement up-to-date best practices, such as multi-factor authentication, strong passwords, and limiting login attempts. As with P1075 and PCI DSS, organizations that only meet the minimum requirements will not be able to take advantage of these defenses. E4 confirmed that while some facilities exceed this "minimum baseline" and systematically replace obsolete devices, others follow the standard exactly as written.

### Additional Security Concerns

E4 described additional security concerns that our auditors did not identify. NERC CIP security controls apply to BPSs based on the amount of power produced, creating three tiers of compliance: the highest tier of power producers must adhere to all security controls, while lower tiers must comply with decreasing subsets. E4 believes this allows attackers to use publicly-available information to target facilities with fewer security controls. Therefore, he argues that NERC should standardize controls across all facilities to mitigate the targeting of smaller stations.

Additionally, E4 stated that the zero-defect culture and high fines associated with NERC’s sanctions program can incentivize minimal-effort security. Organizations that undertake additional security precautions beyond NERC CIP mandates may discover vulnerabilities that would not otherwise be identified. NERC levies fines for non-compliance even when organizations self-report such vulnerabilities, potentially punishing them for transparency. E4 believes this behavior inhibits information sharing across the power sector and collectively lowers security for all facilities. He argues that NERC could reverse this trend by eliminating fines associated with self-reporting and providing “credits” to organizations that contribute to the overall health of the power sector.

### Log Aggregation Center

When discussing log retention, E4 recommended that all facilities should contribute to a common log aggregation center, where security professionals could conduct in-depth security-breach investigations spanning all NERC-compliant facilities.

### Reporting Findings

We made an effort to disclose our findings responsibly. Compliance standards typically have a request-for-comment (RFC) period for submitting comments, concerns, and recommendations during a fixed window. During this study, none of the standards we assessed had an open RFC, and we found no clearly defined channel for reporting security concerns, either directly to affected organizations or at the federal level. Using our partners as mediators, we turned over all of our findings to the IRS; the PCI Security Standards Council; a contributing author of the NERC CIP standards (E4); the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT); the MITRE Corporation’s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) team; and the Department of Homeland Security. We had varying levels of success with these disclosures, as described below.

### IRS P1075

We contacted the IRS, NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD), US-CERT, and the MITRE Corporation to disclose our P1075 findings. US-CERT was the first organization to respond; their technicians concluded that “CVEs are assigned for specific vulnerabilities in implementations. Each issue that requires a ‘separate patch’ can get a CVE [58].” We argued that each of the recommendations we provided are “patches” for the vulnerable portions of the compliance standards, but US-CERT stated that the “patches” must be tied to a specific piece of software. Both NIST NVD and the MITRE Corporation indicated that compliance documents are outside their scope of responsibility, with MITRE stating “that a reasonable person can conclude that IRS Publication 1075 was never intended to have a level of abstraction that was sufficient to direct secure coding [36].” Contradicting this argument, our partners at NYC3 confirmed that auditors are indeed using P1075 as a line-by-line checklist to confirm controls at granular levels, such as access control lists on firewalls.

### PCI DSS

Unlike P1075, we successfully disclosed our findings to members of the PCI SSC. We established a memorandum of understanding with a PCI SSC member organization, which provided our findings to the PCI DSS v4 Working Group. We received notification that our recommendation for improving the “Network Segmentation” section of PCI DSS has already been implemented in Version 4, prior to the opening of their RFC submission window. This change will apply PCI DSS guidelines to the entire networked environment, not just an isolated subnet with cardholder data. Additionally, the v4 Working Group is considering incorporating all feedback associated with our ambiguous specification findings.

### NERC CIP 007-6

Expert E4, after providing feedback, noted that our recommendations would be included at future working groups for CIP revisions. However, it will be years before the next CIP update (potentially taking our recommendations into account) is released. Additionally, our partnered organization for CIP disclosure is incorporating our feedback into a comprehensive evaluation of electric grid security.

### Federal-Level Recognition

To address problems with federal-level compliance standards, we met with representatives from the NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) to discuss our findings. We highlighted that IRS P1075 Section 9 (which contains 49% of the P1075 security concerns we discovered) is copied from older versions of NIST SP 800-53. NCCoE offered to incorporate our findings into future document revisions. In ongoing revisions, NIST acknowledged in draft SP 800-53v5 that organizations may inherit risk when implementing mandated security controls, corroborating many of our study's findings.

Next, we contacted the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Protection and Programs Directorate. Several personnel within the Federal Network Resilience Division expressed interest in assisting with our findings; however, the DHS Office of External Affairs for Cybersecurity and Communications directed our contacts to cease communication and did not provide any alternative mechanisms for disclosure.

### Discussion and Conclusion

Our study provides the first structured evaluation of security issues within digital-security compliance standards. We find that using compliance standards as checklists, with “by-the-letter” implementation of security controls, can create security concerns. Our systematic approach identified security issues spanning multiple root causes and varying levels of risk (shown in Table II). In this section, we discuss common issues across the audited compliance standards, potential mitigations, recommendations for reconsidering compliance programs, and opportunities for future work.

### Common Issues

Some common issues are apparent in our findings. All standards we assessed exhibit under-defined processes and vague writing. While issues of vague writing may not seem immediately dangerous, they have important implications when standards are treated like point-by-point checklists. Many issues stem from passive voice, creating ambiguity about who is responsible for specific actions. Using active voice to construct compliance controls is a best practice that helps eliminate uncertainty and ensure there is a responsible party for requisite actions. If it is not feasible to eliminate passive voice, standards authors could include supplemental best-practice recommendations for identifying responsible personnel. The standard might also require each implementing organization to create a written plan identifying who is responsible for each requirement.

Further, we observed that numerous compliance controls did not have clear deadlines for action. Compliance standards should define expected periodicity (e.g., every 30 days) or thresholds for action (e.g., within 12 hours of an event). These issues with deadlines are especially concerning given that many problems are only mitigated during an immediate run-up to a compliance audit.

Terms such as “when feasible” and optional guidelines create confusion about what is actually required and may provide an illusion of more security than what is actually provided. We recognize that this wording reflects practical limitations, but categorizing clearly insecure systems as “compliant” simply because there is no feasible alternative is counterproductive. Instead, compliance standards could adopt a third category that does not punish the affected organization but still indicates to administrators and auditors that the situation is suboptimal and further precautions are needed. We also recommend moving optional guidelines into supplemental documents separate from mandatory compliance.

Each compliance standard has weak controls for user-access review and revocation procedures. To mitigate insider threats, compliance standards could mandate frequent review of active user accounts and access termination before formally notifying an employee who is terminated.

Lastly, and perhaps most concerning, none of the compliance standards we assessed have mechanisms for reporting security concerns. Without a direct line of communication with a governing body, many discovered security concerns will remain unaddressed. The lack of a centralized CVE database-like construct for reporting problems with compliance standards affects both governing bodies and compliant organizations. Governing bodies do not have a reference for common mistakes when developing compliance standards, meaning issues are likely to repeat across multiple standards. Additionally, this lack of transparency prevents industry-wide alert notifications for issues within a compliance standard. A centralized repository would also present an opportunity to recommend additional best practices to build upon compliance and mitigate any reported gaps.

### Recommendations

Our work highlights difficulties that can arise when compliance standards are used as checklists, regardless of their original intent. This approach seems inevitable when a standard is associated with potentially large penalties for non-compliance, but little or no incentive for going beyond the minimum requirements. This state of affairs suggests a need for rethinking the compliance paradigm more broadly.

First, authors of compliance standards should consider that their standards might be used as an audit checklist. Whenever possible, guidelines should be broadly applicable across a particular domain but concrete enough that line-by-line compliance will provide meaningful security. Writing guidelines that achieve this ideal is difficult and may sometimes be impossible; standards authors should explicitly consider tradeoffs between generalizability and secure implementation when making choices. Providing supplemental documents describing potential issues could help standards implementers manage resulting risks.

Secondly, authors should identify opportunities to craft compliance standards that improve audits beyond checklist assessments and consider an organization’s overall security culture. Provisions for a rewards program could incentivize organizations to bolster security. For example, organizations that take proactive measures beyond minimum requirements or publish digital security lessons learned could receive some limited safe harbor against future sanctions. As discussed during our audit of NERC CIP standards, an organization that responsibly discloses and remedies a vulnerable condition is still liable for financial sanctions. Allowing organizations to self-report issues with less fear of sanctions could incentivize better behavior and increase transparency, with potential benefits for the entire associated sector.

Another consideration for standards authors is that rapidly changing technology necessitates rapidly updated security mechanisms. An effective standards update mechanism should allow easy reporting of issues and enable fast revision of the standard itself, while avoiding imposing costs on organizations that cannot immediately meet the new requirement. Newly updated standards could provide suggestions for transitioning and require organizations to provide a plan for becoming compliant with the updated requirement within a specified time period.

### Future Work

To validate the issues we identified, we developed close collaborations with organizations that implement compliance standards and conduct associated audits. Future work should investigate how standards organizations generate and maintain their standards, and how they can be improved to better serve the needs of the industry.
