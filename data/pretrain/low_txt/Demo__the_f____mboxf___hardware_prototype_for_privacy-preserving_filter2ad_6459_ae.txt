### Oracle Queries and Tag Distinguishability

Oracle queries should be executed on all tags except for two, which are reserved for the challenge phase. The adversary's task is to distinguish between these two tags. Our assumption regarding tag responses is that the output of one-way hash functions is indistinguishable from a random bit string of equal length.

### Key Insulation and Adversary Models

In [2], Bellare et al. demonstrate that achieving public-channel key-insulated security in the presence of an active adversary (one who can compromise the secret key) is impossible. While we follow the key insulation idea from [7], assuming a passive adversary (who can only eavesdrop) in the context of RFID is impractical, as it is relatively easy for an adversary to access a tag’s memory. Therefore, the assumptions made in our scheme (and in [16]) are more realistic for achieving restricted backward security and other features. However, many existing mutual authentication protocols may support restricted backward security under our assumptions, such as [3], [19], and [17]. Nevertheless, [3] and [19] require tags to remember too many secrets and cannot provide forward security, as shown by [13] and [22], respectively. Additionally, [17] demands more computational resources and lacks reader authentication. None of these protocols have provided a formal model for backward security, even if imperfect.

### Desynchronization Attacks

Although not the primary focus of our proposed protocol, it can also prevent desynchronization attacks [20] to some extent. Consider the following attack: if the last message is blocked, the tag updates the shared secret key, \( K \), but the server does not. As a result, the server and tag can no longer communicate successfully. To mitigate this, the server must remember the last valid authentication session transcripts and secret values. When the server receives a random number instead of a valid authentication value from a tag, it updates itself using the information from the last valid session and attempts to resynchronize with the tag. While scalability is a concern, this approach can help avoid desynchronization attacks to a limited extent (the system will still desynchronize if the last messages from two consecutive sessions are blocked). Even if the system desynchronizes, an adversary cannot trace a tag from its desynchronized state because the tag's responses are always pseudorandom and indistinguishable. Our primary concern is the 'exposure resilience' of the secret key and its impact on the authentication protocol rather than desynchronization attacks. Providing full resistance against desynchronization attacks is a separate issue.

### Performance Comparison with Previous Works

We compare our work, based on security properties and computational cost, with the LK and SM schemes in Table II below. According to [8], a scheme must satisfy both forward security and indistinguishability to achieve 'strong location privacy.' If a scheme satisfies indistinguishability only, it is considered 'weak location private.' [15] has shown that the SM scheme is not forward secure, making it weakly location private, whereas our scheme is strongly location private. The SM scheme does not provide a formal security model for indistinguishability and forward security.

Regarding computational requirements, our protocol uses a simple one-way hash function, random number generation, and the XOR operation. We use a simple hash function like SQUASH [12] to achieve forward security for the tag, requiring approximately 1K gates.

### Authentication Process

Since the server needs to authenticate itself first to a tag, it must broadcast authentication messages to all tags. The server does not know the ID of the specific tag it wants to authenticate, so it must compute and broadcast authentication messages for all tags in its storage. We assume the server has sufficient resources for this computation. A tag receiving the broadcast messages must find a match with its verification value. Although computing the verification value is constant, finding a match increases the required computations proportionally to the number of broadcast messages in the worst case. This scenario is unavoidable when the server must authenticate itself first to a tag. Our scheme is more suitable for environments where the reader must read multiple tags simultaneously (e.g., inventory management) or where there are not too many tags (e.g., a library with a few thousand books).

### Conclusion

We have proposed APRAP, a privacy-preserving mutual RFID authentication protocol for a shared key environment. The protocol uses two different keys for mutual authentication. The server sends a random partial key (generated from a master secret key \( K_m \)) to a tag. The tag generates the session key \( K_s \) to authenticate itself to the server. The tag's secret key \( K \) is updated using the partial key received from the server. Since \( K \) is fresh for each time period, the tag's security is guaranteed for all other time periods (both past and future) under our assumptions. We show that our scheme is computationally more efficient than the SM and LK schemes. Our protocol satisfies indistinguishability and achieves both forward and restricted backward security through key insulation. We also provide a formal security model for the proposed protocol.
