### Introduction
"There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so."
— William Shakespeare

I was recently told by someone I consider to be a subject matter expert that introductions in books, although seldom read by typical readers, are meant to respect the reader. Introductions are not intended to insinuate that the reader will only understand the book’s subject matter once they’ve read it cover to cover. Instead, the introduction should summarize what’s to come, not to aggrandize it.

The core subject of this book is the attacker mindset, which involves the gathering, processing, and applying of information for an objective. This is the key takeaway. If you stop reading now, you will have received the central message. However, I hope that what keeps you reading is the detailed exploration of how to do this as an attacker—how to process and apply information for the benefit of the mission.

**The Art of Attack** examines all aspects of the attacker mindset (AMs), focusing on the fundamental components. By breaking these down, the book empowers you to build your own brand of attacker mindset. I will describe the principles of this mindset and how to interweave them with the process most attacks follow, namely: reconnaissance, initial approach, privilege escalation, redundant access, and escape. Through this attacker lens, the book explores tools you can implement as attackers and the psychological principles involved. I will also highlight the importance of practical considerations, such as bringing snacks on a job, which might seem trivial but can be crucial in certain situations.

To help you remember the material, I’ll provide stories (both successes and failures) to make transferring AMs from theory into practice much easier. As a practitioner of social engineering, I will mainly concentrate on examples of the attacker mindset from my field experiences. However, as a trained penetration tester, there will also be crossover.

The tagline I’ve used to summarize the attacker mindset over the years is: "There really is nothing good or bad, but your attacker mindset makes it so." This line effectively encapsulates how this book came into being: countless hours of teaching people the art of the attacker mindset allowed me to distill it into that statement. The attacker mindset allows us to hack information, which may seem neutral to the untrained observer but can be lethal when leveraged correctly. There is no information that is simply good or bad; it is processed through the lens of the attack and its objective.

I wrote this book to teach this mentality, but each of you will build your own version of it that reflects your strengths and weaknesses. This book should teach you how to think, not what to think.
