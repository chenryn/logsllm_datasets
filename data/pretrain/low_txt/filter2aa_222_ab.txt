### Monitoring and Security Measures

- **Keep an eye out for the party van (or cable technicians)**: Be vigilant of any suspicious activity, such as unmarked vans or individuals claiming to be cable technicians.
- **Pay for service on one modem and have another one hooked up that is modified for anonymous internet**: Use a secondary, modified modem to access the internet anonymously while maintaining a legitimate, paid service.
- **Be careful with which HFC MAC addresses you clone**: Ensure that cloned MAC addresses are carefully selected to avoid detection.
- **Remove line identifiers to assist in anonymity (especially at apartment complexes)**: Eliminate any identifying information from your connection to enhance anonymity, especially in multi-unit dwellings.

### Response from the SERC Showcase

- **Anonymous Internet was not nearly as much of a concern as BPI/BPI+ in DOCSIS 1/1.1/2.0**:
  - The maximum privacy offered via encryption is 56-bit DES, which is relatively weak by modern standards.

### Firmware Overview

#### Enter bitemytaco
- **Pros**:
  - You may already have it, referred to as shelled firmware.
  - Every bit as functional as hacked firmware if you know what you’re doing.
  - Stock firmware straight from the manufacturer.
- **Cons**:
  - RTFM (Read the Fine Manual).
  - May take some trial and error to configure for proper use.
  - No GUI (Graphical User Interface).

#### Diagnostic Factory Firmware
- **Pros**:
  - Works without too much trouble.
  - Fairly decent list of firmware features.
  - Based on altered versions of factory shelled firmware.
- **Cons**:
  - Created by DerEngel’s hired group of coders.
  - You install a license to use it.
  - Costs money.
  - Beware of possible backdoors and rebooting issues.

#### Sigma X2
- **Pros**:
  - Free alternatives to sigma (no licenses).
  - Improved features for a changing world.
  - Based directly off factory shelled firmwares.
  - Stable!
- **Cons**:
  - Still some bugs.
  - So many features it can become confusing.

### Abstract
- **Why should you listen to me?**
  - IT & IS Consultant.
  - Actively pursuing CISSP certification.
  - Active member & admin of SBH.
  - Assisted Rajkohaxor (The Serbian Prodigy) on development design, debugging, and testing of Haxorware with financial backing from Bitemytaco of SBH.

### Background Information

### Objectives for Honest Discussions
- **Provide an open forum for users, hackers, professionals & law enforcement**:
  - Hacked modems exist; warrantless wiretaps legal?
  - Used for anonymous, free, or faster internet.
  - Virtually undetectable; could be used for evil.
- **Understand & evaluate Docsis networks as a viable telecommunications protocol**:
  - The nature of Docsis HFC networks & hardware.
  - Security flaws & best practices.
  - Improper use and abuse by all parties.
  - How can we make it better & Can We Coexist?

### What is a Docsis Cable Modem?
- **BPI: Baseline Privacy Interface**:
  - Methods for encrypting traffic between the cable modem and the CMTS at triple 56-bit DES with 768/1024 bit key modulus.
- **BPI+: Baseline Privacy Interface Plus**:
  - Implemented in Docsis 1.1 Specs (backwards compatible).
  - Introduces X.509 v3 (RSA 1024-bit) digital certificates & key pairs.
  - Authentication based on certificate hardware identity; validated when modem registers with a CMTS.
- **Certificates, Keys & The ‘trust ring’**:
  - Stored in the non-vol settings of a modem's firmware.
  - Contains: Public, Private, and Root Keys, CM & CA Certificates.
  - DOCSIS Root CA signs manufacturer CA intermediate certificate, manufacturer signs CM certificate. CMTS parses and verifies CM certificate, an identity based on HFC MAC.

### Trust: Encryption & Authentication
- **Hardware (blame the manufacturers)**:
  - Absolutely no physical security.
  - Common hardware components.
- **Software (blame the developers)**:
  - Initial hacks involved netboot/etherboot, enabling built-in factory mode (implemented by the OS and enabled by setting a SNMP OID) or using stock (noisy) bootloaders.
  - Diagnostic firmware does the job, but better firmware with custom features is easy to make.
- **ISP (blame the administrators)**:
  - Improperly configured CMTS.
  - Security flaws in CMTS IOS.
  - Costs & convenience.

### Why hacking modems is possible?

### Perspectives: Role Playing
- **Customers**:
  - Protect and respect our privacy.
  - Provide us with quality but NOT limited service.
  - Stop charging more when you’ve failed.
- **Hackers**:
  - You might expect this.
  - We demand anonymous internet access (why not?).
  - You make it so easy, it seems like it’s on purpose.
  - Not my fault the network is not configured properly.
  - …You WILL still have a problem.
- **ISPs**:
  - We should probably just lie.
  - Let’s cut corners to save money.
  - Unlimited user bandwidth bad (Customer monthly throughput < Profit).
  - You can’t do that on the Internets!
  - Your information is being sold to the highest bidder.

### Disassembling the Firmware
- **This firmware sucks!...**
- **Three types of firmware images**:
  - Signed & Compressed (PKCS#7 & binary).
  - Compressed binary image.
  - RAM dump images (uncompressed & raw).
- **A dump image is loaded in IDA Pro for reversing work or manipulation**.
- **Current firmware uses VxWorks or ECOS, both are coded in MIPS-32 assembly (fun for the whole family)**.

### Firmware Images
- **Anatomy of the flash contents**.

### Reverse & Disassemble Tools
- **Unsigned firmware binary images**.
- **LZMA, CMImageTool by BOLTAR or other custom applications**.
- **Your favorite hex editor**.
- **IDA Pro Advanced**.
- **Your favorite compiler (write your own)**.
- **Serial console cable**.
- **Jtag (optional)**.
- **Vacation from real life & a lot of patience**.

### The Future
- **Better firmware**.
- **ISP lockdowns**:
  - Craigslist is full of morons.
- **Docsis 3.0**:
  - More speed, essentially the same security.
  - Advanced class of service mappings.
- **Purposefully designed anonymous networks**:
  - In a perfect world, this would be a priority.

### Problems & Some Solutions
- **BPI+**:
  - Crack 56-bit DES or X.509 v3 RSA? (time, money, and more time).
  - Corporate espionage.
  - Self-signed certificates.
  - Reverse current bpimanager & built-in self-signing functions.
- **Cloning Detection**:
  - Exact/perfect clones can usually bypass this.
  - Network access can be gained on the majority of ISPs as long as authentication is passed; cloning isn’t exactly necessary.
  - If you still can’t force a config to get network access, firmware modification is usually the answer.
- **The situation for ISPs preventing unauthorized access still looks very bleak for several reasons**.
