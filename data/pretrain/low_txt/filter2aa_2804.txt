## Wireless Technology and Networks
### What is Wireless?
- **Definition (Merriam-Webster)**: "Having no wire or wires."
- **Basic Components of a Wireless System**:
  - **Antenna**: Acts as the conduit for wireless signals.
  - **Transmitter**: Sends radio frequency (RF) signals.
  - **Receiver**: Receives RF signals.

### Who is Using It?
- **Applications**:
  - TV, Radio, Satellite
  - Police, Fire, EMS
  - Cell Phones, Pagers
  - Building Access Cards
  - Automatic Toll Collection (Toll Tags)

### Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs)
- **Usage**: Popular with Police and Fire departments.
- **Features**:
  - Instant access to dispatcher data.
  - Historically, monitoring was legal; now more secure.
  - New features include live video monitoring.

### Cellular Technologies
- **3G (Third Generation)**:
  - **Timeline**: 2002 and beyond.
  - **Data Speeds**: 144+ Kbps.
  - **Features**: Video and Audio.
- **2.5G (Not Quite 3G)**:
  - **Timeline**: 2001 to present.
  - **Services**: Digital/PCS.
  - **Data Speeds**: 56 Kbps.
  - **Features**: Email messaging.
- **2G (Second Generation)**:
  - **Timeline**: 1995 to present.
  - **Services**: Digital/PCS.
  - **Data Speeds**: 9.6 – 19 Kbps.
  - **Features**: Text messaging.
- **1G (First Generation)**:
  - **Timeline**: 1983 to present.
  - **Service**: Analog cellular.
  - **Features**: Voice only.

### 802.11 Networks
- **802.11g**:
  - **Speed**: 20 Mbps.
  - **Frequency**: 2.4 GHz.
- **802.11b**:
  - **Speed**: 11 Mbps.
  - **Frequency**: 2.4 GHz.
- **802.11a**:
  - **Speed**: 54 Mbps.
  - **Frequency**: 5.15-5 GHz.
- **802.11**:
  - **Speed**: 1 to 2 Mbps.
  - **Frequency**: 2.4 GHz.

### Wireless Devices
- **PDAs**:
  - **Examples**: Palm, iPAQ.
  - **Market Trends**: Strong growth in 2000, followed by a gradual decline, but renewed interest due to technological advances.
- **Converged Devices**:
  - **Combination**: PDA and Phone.
  - **Features**: All connectivity options.
  - **Design**: Prioritizes size over security.
- **Wireless Security Cameras**.
- **RFID Devices**.

## Defining Wireless Threats
- **WarDriving**:
  - **Activity**: Searching and logging.
- **Data Snooping**:
  - **Activity**: Capturing data.
- **Jamming**:
  - **Activity**: Disrupting legitimate signals.
- **Insertion Attacks**:
  - **Activity**: Unauthorized clients and access points.

- **Malicious Code**:
  - **Virus**: A piece of code that can replicate itself.
  - **SMS - URLs & Attachments**: Malicious links and attachments.
  - **Worm**: A program that copies itself to other disks, masquerading as a valid program.
  - **Trojan**: A program that launches other programs or code, masquerading as a valid program.

### Emerging Threats
- **Liberty Trojan (PLAM)**: September 2000 - Deleted applications, unable to replicate.
- **Timophonica (Spain)**: January 2001 - First automatic dialer.
- **911**: April 2001 - Caused phones to repeatedly dial 911, sent to over 100,000 phones.
- **Flooder**: August 2001 - Sent unwanted SMS messages.
- **Phage & Vapor**: September 2001 - Deleted files and hid applications.

## Why Malicious Code Will Spread
- **Analogy**: In nature, viruses infect all organisms, even the tiniest bacteria (e.g., Smallpox, Plague, SARS).
- **Computer Viruses**: Infect all platforms that reach a certain level of sophistication (e.g., Melissa, LoveBug, Klez).

### Four Main Factors
1. **Poor or Non-Existent Protection**:
   - Limited built-in protection (e.g., Nokia 9000 series has some protection).
   - Data transmissions are protected but not scanned.
2. **Power of New Devices**:
   - PDAs can run PC-like applications, increasing automation.
   - Regular synchronization opens doors for malicious code.
   - Common development languages make it easier to create malicious code.
3. **Standardization of Networks**:
   - Standardized networks facilitate the spread of malicious code.
   - Trend towards TCP/IP related standards.
4. **Increased Connection of Devices**:
   - Multiple ways to connect to the internet and email.
   - Increased SMS/MMS popularity and exposure.

## Economic Impact and Potential Damages
### Damages
- **Unwanted Messages**.
- **Data Erasure, Deletion, or Theft**.
- **Device Unusability**.
- **Network Slowdowns and Performance Issues**.
- **Network Intrusion**.

### Impact
- **Customer Complaints**.
- **Higher Turnover from Unhappy Customers**.
- **Cost from Unwanted Traffic**.
- **Dropped Calls**.
- **Cleaning Devices and Servers/Networks**.
- **Purchasing New Technology**.

### Financial Impact
- **Estimated Losses**:
  - 2003: $43 million.
  - 2004: $212 million.
  - 2005: $471 million (for 5 million users).

## Protecting Against Malicious Threats
- **Protection at Every Point**:
  - Devices, switches, towers, central offices, etc.
- **Scanning Services**:
  - Mobile operators should offer scanning services to clients.
  - Scanning servers and data streams.
- **Proactive Solutions**:
  - Implementing solutions now could save millions in lost revenue and expenses.
  - Antivirus vendors need to step up.
- **Contingency Plans**:
  - Mobile operators and device manufacturers need plans to address simultaneous infections.

## Conclusion
- **Top Four Reasons for Malicious Code Spread**:
  1. Minimal current protection.
  2. Increased computing power.
  3. Standardization.
  4. Growing connectivity.
- **Economic Impact**:
  - Estimated $471 million loss per 5 million users by 2005.
- **Call to Action**:
  - Mobile Operators, Administrators, Manufacturers, and Developers should act now and think proactively to better protect their systems.
