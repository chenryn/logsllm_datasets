### Summary of Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:07:06 to 18:07:11 on October 18, documents a series of issues and retries in a Hadoop environment. The key points are as follows:

1. **Resource Manager (RM) Communication Errors**:
   - Multiple attempts to contact the RM (Resource Manager) at `msra-sa-41:8030` failed, with errors logged at 18:07:06, 18:07:08, 18:07:10.
   - The system is retrying the connection with a retry policy of up to 10 attempts, with a 1-second interval between each attempt. This is indicated by the log entries at 18:07:08 and 18:07:10.

2. **Address Change Detection**:
   - There are frequent address change detections for both the RM and the lease renewer. The old address `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` (for RM) and `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` (for lease renewer) are being updated to `msra-sa-41:8030` and `msra-sa-41:9000` respectively. These changes are logged at 18:07:06, 18:07:07, 18:07:08, 18:07:09, 18:07:10, and 18:07:11.

3. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The lease renewer, identified as `LeaseRenewer:msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`, is unable to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`. The failures are logged at 18:07:06, 18:07:07, 18:07:08, 18:07:09, 18:07:10, and 18:07:11, with the duration of the failure increasing by one second each time (from 128 seconds to 133 seconds).
   - The system indicates that it will retry the lease renewal shortly after each failure.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **18:07:06**:
  - **ERROR**: RM communication error.
  - **WARN**: Address change detected for RM.
  - **WARN**: Lease renewer failed to renew lease for 128 seconds.

- **18:07:07**:
  - **WARN**: Address change detected for RM.
  - **WARN**: Address change detected for lease renewer.
  - **WARN**: Lease renewer failed to renew lease for 129 seconds.

- **18:07:08**:
  - **INFO**: Retrying connection to RM.
  - **ERROR**: RM communication error.
  - **WARN**: Address change detected for RM.
  - **WARN**: Address change detected for lease renewer.
  - **WARN**: Lease renewer failed to renew lease for 130 seconds.

- **18:07:09**:
  - **WARN**: Address change detected for RM.
  - **WARN**: Address change detected for lease renewer.
  - **WARN**: Lease renewer failed to renew lease for 131 seconds.

- **18:07:10**:
  - **INFO**: Retrying connection to RM.
  - **ERROR**: RM communication error.
  - **WARN**: Address change detected for RM.
  - **WARN**: Address change detected for lease renewer.
  - **WARN**: Lease renewer failed to renew lease for 132 seconds.

- **18:07:11**:
  - **WARN**: Address change detected for RM.
  - **WARN**: Address change detected for lease renewer.
  - **WARN**: Lease renewer failed to renew lease for 133 seconds.

### Conclusion
The log indicates ongoing issues with RM communication and lease renewal, likely due to network or configuration changes. The system is attempting to resolve these issues through retries and address updates, but the problems persist. Further investigation into the network and Hadoop configuration may be necessary to resolve these issues.
