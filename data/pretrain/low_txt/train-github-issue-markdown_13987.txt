In the "Install" tab under "Settings," the search box no longer initiates a search when the Enter key is pressed. To perform a search, I must first click on the inactive button in the button group labeled "Packages/Themes," and then click back to the category I actually want to search. 

I am using a new MacBook running OS X 10.10 with Atom version 0.206.0.
