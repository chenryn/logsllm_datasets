# DEFCON 16: Virtually Hacking
**Date:** August 8, 2008

## Why VMware?
- **Virtualization Adoption:** Virtualization has become a mainstream technology and is here to stay.
- **Client Usage:** Many of our clients are leveraging virtualization technologies.
- **Service Offerings:** Virtualization services are being widely sold.
- **Market Dominance:** VMware is the leading product in this space. (Source: silicon.com)
- **Necessity for Familiarity:** To effectively hack a system, one must be thoroughly familiar with it.

## VMware: Different Flavors
- **Player:** A free tool for running pre-configured virtual machines.
- **Workstation:** A more advanced tool for creating and managing virtual machines.
- **Server (GSX):** An older version of VMware's server virtualization platform.
- **ESX:** The enterprise-grade hypervisor for high-performance virtualization.

## Key Concepts
- **Virtual Machines (VMs):** One physical server can run multiple operating systems simultaneously.
- **Primary Configuration File (.vmx):** Contains the configuration settings for a VM.
- **Virtual Disk File (.vmdk):** Represents the hard drive of the VM.
- **Virtual Machine Snapshot (.vmsn):** Captures the state of the VM at a specific point in time.
- **Virtual Machine Page File (.vmem):** Used for memory management.

### Virtual Machine Files
- **Mounting Virtual Disks:** The virtual machine disk file can be mounted, allowing easy access to its contents.
- **Demo:** Demonstrating how to read files from a mounted virtual disk.

## Hacking VMware Server
- **Interesting Ports on 192.168.1.53:**
  - **21/tcp:** FTP
  - **22/tcp:** SSH
  - **80/tcp:** HTTP
  - **111/tcp:** RPCbind
  - **113/tcp:** Auth
  - **389/tcp:** LDAP
  - **902/tcp:** ISS RealSecure Sensor, vmware-authd

### VMware Server Tools
- **vmware-cmd.pl:**
  - List VMs
  - Get State
  - Start/Stop
  - Get Configuration
  - Get Remote Connections
  - Set Guest Info
- **VMware VIX API:**
  - List VMs
  - Power On/Off
  - Login Guest
  - Copy Files
  - Run Programs
  - Run Scripts
  - **Ruby Bindings:** Easily scriptable, equivalent to 130 lines of C code.
  - **Example Script:**
    ```ruby
    require 'ruby_vix'
    Vix.RunProgramInGuest('10.0.0.9', 902, s_username, s_password, vmusername, vmpassword, '/var/vms/windows.vmx', 'net user vmuser vmuser /ADD', "")
    ```

### Demo
- **Objective:** Obtain credentials, extract information, and gain control over the system.

## Hacking VMware ESX
- **Interesting Ports on 192.168.1.58:**
  - **22/tcp:** SSH
  - **80/tcp:** HTTP
  - **443/tcp:** HTTPS
  - **902/tcp:** ISS RealSecure
  - **903/tcp:** ISS Console Manager
  - **5988/tcp, 5989/tcp:** Unknown

### VMware ESX Features
- **Web Service (SOAP) Interface:** Accessible via `https://vmware-esx/sdk`
- **Web Server:** Accessible via `https://vmware-esx/ui` and `https://vmware-esx/mob`
- **COS (Console Operating System):** Red Hat-derived, accessible via SSH

### VMware ESX Tools
- **VI API:**
  - Reboot Guest
  - Reboot Host
  - Scan Host Patch
  - Create User
  - Remove Virtual Switch

### Demo
- **Objective:** Perform checks without authentication and exploit identified weaknesses.

## dradis – A Quick Introduction
- **Tool for Structuring Information:**
  - Client/Server architecture
  - Ruby-based
  - Extensible (add modules, define methodologies)
  - Conditional operations based on intercepted actions/results
  - Website: [dradis.sourceforge.net](http://dradis.sourceforge.net)

### dradis in Action
- **Environment Description:**
  - Provide details about the environment
  - Based on the description, dradis suggests checks or operations
  - Example:
    - If the host is ESX, determine the version
    - If the version is 3.5, check for enabled services
    - If SSH is enabled, check for weak accounts

### Demo
- **Objective:** Demonstrate the functionality of dradis in a real-world scenario.

## Recommendations: Am I Going to Get Owned?
- **Security Best Practices:**
  - Follow VMware's security guidance
  - Apply updates regularly
- **Network Segmentation:**
  - Keep management networks separate from core and guest networks
- **Hardening:**
  - Harden the virtual network (disable promiscuous mode, reject MAC address changes, reject forged IP traffic)
  - Disable copy and paste between guest and host
  - Ensure guest OS cannot read the CD drive on the host OS
  - Log appropriately (not too much, not too little)
- **Additional Security Measures:**
  - Use tools like CIScan for further hardening
  - Evaluate if all running services are necessary

## Future Work
- **Ongoing Exploration:**
  - There are still many VMware technologies to explore and test.

## Conclusion
- **Next Steps:**
  - Experiment with the provided tools
  - Provide feedback and suggest new features
