## Abstract
Touch-based verification, which uses touch gestures (e.g., swiping, zooming) to authenticate users on touchscreen devices, has been widely evaluated as a potential second layer of defense for PIN lock mechanisms. However, in all performance evaluations, researchers have assumed naive (zero-effort) forgeries where the attacker makes no effort to mimic a given gesture pattern.

In this paper, we demonstrate that a simple "Lego" robot, driven by input gleaned from general population swiping statistics, can generate forgeries that achieve alarmingly high penetration rates against touch-based authentication systems. Using the best classification algorithms in touch-based authentication, we rigorously explore the effect of the attack, finding that it increases the Equal Error Rates (EERs) of the classifiers by between 339% and 1004%, depending on parameters such as the failure-to-enroll threshold and the type of touch stroke generated by the robot. This paper calls into question the zero-effort impostor testing approach used to benchmark the performance of touch-based authentication systems.

## 1. Introduction
Recently, there has been considerable research on the application of touch gestures for continuous authentication on mobile phones (e.g., [17], [16], [27]). The underlying philosophy is that if a mobile device can learn the owner’s touch pattern during routine operations (such as swiping, zooming, and clicking/tapping), an adversary who gains access to the phone can be thwarted based on the mismatch between touch patterns. While several studies (e.g., [17], [27], [16]) have shown promise, the performance evaluation methodology in these studies revolves around a zero-effort threat model, where the adversary is assumed to be unable to perform a sophisticated forgery.

The zero-effort threat model, although well understood, is not representative of state-of-the-art threats [9]. Researchers often argue that it sufficiently captures the practical threats faced by touch-based authentication systems. For instance, Frank et al. [17] argue:
- It is unlikely that someone could learn the touch behavior of 30 features, such as pressure and distribution of acceleration, just by looking over the shoulder.
- A more successful but involved attack would be to place malware on the user’s device, but a user with malware has already lost the race against the attacker.

While these arguments are sound, they overlook two key attributes of touch biometric systems:
1. **Intra-user Variability and Population Overlap:** Users' behavioral biometric patterns exhibit significant intra-user variability and overlap across a large population. Statistics extracted from a large population database could be used to create forgeries that significantly increase error rates [8], [26].
2. **Ease of Implementation with Robots:** The three gestures used in touch-based continuous authentication (clicking or tapping, vertical swiping, and horizontal swiping) can be easily implemented using elementary robotic devices available in many homes and stores [5].

These attributes motivate our attack, which uses a standard Lego Mindstorms NXT robotic kit to control a "finger" designed to replicate human finger properties. Using a large touch biometrics dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack against the best verification algorithms in touch-based authentication.

### Key Attributes of the Attack:
- **No Specialized Expertise Required:** The design is based on basic Lego robotic skills taught in middle school.
- **Analog Domain and Sample-Level Attributes:** The attack is launched in the analog domain, making it difficult to stop with conventional software solutions. It is sample-level, meaning the attacker does not need to know the internal implementation details.
- **No Extraordinary Access Privileges Required:** The attack is driven by general information on how a "common user" is likely to swipe, which can be retrieved from publicly accessible datasets.

Our main contribution is demonstrating that robotic devices pose a major threat to touch-based authentication. This threat, previously unconsidered, could lead to a reevaluation of the design and testing methodologies of touch-based authentication systems.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 covers data collection and preprocessing, Section 4 describes the attack design, Section 5 presents the attack results, and Section 6 provides conclusions.

## 2. Related Work
To contextualize our work, we examine two streams of past research: algorithmic attacks against behavioral biometric systems and the use of touch gestures for authentication. The latter category includes continuous authentication (e.g., [17], [16], [27]) and "entry point" authentication (e.g., [24], [25], [13]).

### Continuous Authentication
- **Frank et al. [17]:** Achieved EERs of 0-4% using k-NN and SVM classifiers with 30 features extracted from swiping/scrolling gestures.
- **[27]:** Enhanced performance using a digital sensor glove, reducing FAR and FRR.
- **Li et al. [16]:** Achieved 95% accuracy using an SVM-based system on a live implementation.

All these studies used a zero-effort testing approach, which is inadequate against sophisticated adversaries. Our work advances the state-of-the-art by calling for more rigorous biometric testing methodologies.

### Impostor Attacks
- **Ballard et al. [9]:** Demonstrated attacks against handwriting biometrics.
- **Tey et al. [21] and Serwadda et al. [26]:** Showcased attacks against keystroke authentication.

These studies highlight the need for more robust testing methods, but our attack stands out due to its low expertise requirement, low cost, and hardware-based nature.

## 3. Data and Features Used for Our Investigations
### 3.1 Data Collection Process
We conducted two data collection experiments using Android applications that captured users' touch interactions. The gestures include zooming, clicking, horizontal swiping, and vertical swiping. We focused on the two swipe gestures, as they are most commonly used in continuous authentication.

For each touch stroke, the applications recorded:
- x and y coordinates
- Time of contact
- Area occluded between the finger and screen
- Pressure exerted
- Orientation of the phone (landscape or portrait)

The applications simulated text reading and image viewing, requiring users to answer questions by selecting from multiple choices. Both applications followed the same concept, with users scrolling/swiping to find clues and select answers.

This data was used to evaluate the effectiveness of our robotic attack on touch-based authentication systems.
