### Figure 4: Impact of Euclidean Distance on Extra Distances and Waiting Times

**Description:**
- **Left Panel:** The effect of Euclidean distance on the additional distances drivers must travel.
- **Right Panel:** The effect of Euclidean distance on the waiting time for riders.
- **Zone Settings:** Different zone configurations are considered to balance the trade-off between anonymity and operational overhead.

**Observations:**
- The overhead added by ORide is reasonable.
- In scenarios with a very strong adversarial Service Provider (SP), the overhead is already significant.
- For special events like concerts and sports, the SP can divide crowded zones into sub-zones to find a balance.
- In areas with fewer ride activities, an entire borough or city can be a single zone.
- For example, a zone comprising the boroughs of Queens and Bronx ensures an anonymity set of at least 26,000 rides while requiring only a 2 Mbps internet connection for drivers.

### 9.5 Effect on Ride Matching

**Objective:**
- Minimize extra costs for both drivers (e.g., gas and driving time) and riders (e.g., waiting times).

**Challenges:**
- Ideal matching algorithms should consider road networks and real-time traffic conditions.
- Due to the limited operations supported by Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE), ORide uses a simpler metric: Euclidean distances between rider and driver locations.
- Bandwidth constraints limit ORide to matching riders with drivers in the same zone, which can lead to suboptimal matches, especially near zone borders.

**Experimental Results:**
- **Figure 4** shows the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the relative extra costs due to ORide's suboptimality compared to the ideal solution for three different zone settings: Z1, Z2, and the entire city of New York (NYC).
- The experiment was conducted on 1,000 randomly selected ride requests.
- For the ideal matching, Google Maps Distance Matrix APIs were used to compute times and distances between pick-up requests and available drivers.
- To reduce API requests, 100 drivers closest to the pick-up location were selected as potential candidates for the ideal matching.

**Key Findings:**
- The median extra costs are shown in the figure.
- The number of API requests per day is limited.

### Appendix

#### A.1 Covertly Active Service Provider (SP)

**Protocol Changes:**
- **Figure 5** illustrates modifications to the original ride setup procedure (Section 5.4) to handle a covertly active SP.
- Introduces the concept of Proof-of-Ride (PoR), a token that verifies the rider's authenticity, i.e., she has taken a ride in the past.

#### A.2 Plaintext Space

**Quantization:**
- Consider a geographical area of size \( s \times s \) and a plaintext space of \( b \) bits to represent squared-Euclidean distances.
- The area can be quantized into a grid with cells of size \( \frac{s}{2^{(b-1)/2}} \times \frac{s}{2^{(b-1)/2}} \).
- For example, with a 20-bit plaintext space and a 60 km² area (like Manhattan in NYC), the grid resolution would be approximately 10 m × 10 m.

#### A.3 Cryptographic Primitives

**Blind Signatures:**
- A blind-signature scheme [13] allows the signer to sign a message without knowing its content. The requester blinds the message, receives the signature, and then unblinds it to obtain a valid signature for the original message.

**Anonymous Credentials:**
- An anonymous credential (AC) is a cryptographic token that allows the owner to prove certain properties without revealing their identity.
- In ORide, users obtain ACs from the SP and reveal only the expiration date and role (rider or driver) during anonymous sessions.
- Riders can prove their reputation to drivers by revealing the reputation score in their AC along with a zero-knowledge proof.
- ORide uses the Anonymous Credentials Light (ACL) [9], which is a linkable anonymous credential scheme, ensuring each credential can only be used once.

**Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT):**
- NTT is the finite ring version of the Discrete Fourier Transform.
- It can be implemented with fast algorithms of complexity \( O(n \log n) \), especially when \( n \) is a power of 2.
- NTT has a convolution property, reducing the complexity of convolutions from \( O(n^2) \) to \( O(n \log n) \) plus \( O(n) \) for the component-wise product.
- For cryptographic applications, the product operation in the polynomial ring is a nega-cyclic convolution, requiring a 2n-th root of unity in \( \mathbb{Z}_t \).

### Figure 5: Protocol Changes for Covertly Active SP

**Description:**
- **Rider:** Initiates an anonymous session \( s_R \).
- **SP:** Manages the session.
- **Driver:** Initiates an anonymous session \( s_D \).
- **Steps (1) to (10):** Similar to the original protocol in Figure 2, with additional steps for PoR and key exchange.

**Key Steps:**
- **(1)** Rider sends \( z, d_t, c_{xR}, c_{yR}, k_p, \text{PoR} \).
- **(2)** Driver receives \( k_p, \text{PoR} \).
- **(10a)** Random value.
- **(10b)** Blind signature from SP.
- **(10c)** PoR is updated with the blind signature.
