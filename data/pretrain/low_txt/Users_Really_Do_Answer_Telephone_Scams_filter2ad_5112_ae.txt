### Caller Impersonation and Vigilance in Telephone Phishing Scams

In a typical telephone phishing scam, the caller, using a pre-recorded human voice with an American accent, impersonates an internal entity. The caller employs fear-based scenarios to motivate the recipient to take action. To prevent falling victim to such scams, it is crucial to address and prevent impersonation. Our statistical analysis has shown that impersonating an internal entity significantly increases the success rate of these scams.

To combat impersonation, feedback from our survey participants indicates that vigilance is a key factor in not falling for such scams. Many respondents expressed distrust when they were already on high alert regarding potential scam scenarios. Therefore, we recommend enhancing education and awareness about telephone phishing as a primary countermeasure.

### Technical Solutions and User Studies

We also propose technical solutions to help individuals stay vigilant against phishing calls. To our knowledge, there have been no prior empirical user studies specifically focused on telephone phishing. The most similar study was conducted by Aburrous et al. [36], who performed a phone phishing experiment on 50 employees. Female colleagues, known to the employees, attempted to deceive them into giving away their e-banking usernames and passwords. The experiment resulted in 32% of the employees being deceived. This suggests an insider attack rather than an impersonation attack.

Other related work has studied phishing through different channels. Dhamija et al. [37] conducted a website phishing study on 22 university participants, with their best phishing site fooling more than 90% of the participants. Egelman et al. [38] tested the effectiveness of various web browser phishing warnings on 60 in-person participants. They found that 79% of Internet Explorer 7.0 users heeded active phishing warnings, while only 13% obeyed passive warnings. Jagatic et al. [13] performed a social media spear phishing study on 481 targeted Indiana University student emails, achieving a 72% success rate. Vidas et al. [39] conducted a QR code phishing study, distributing 139 posters at Carnegie Mellon University and Pittsburgh, which tricked 225 individuals into visiting the associated website over four weeks.

### Conclusion

This paper presents the methodology, design, execution, results, analysis, and evaluation of a study exploring why telephone phishing works and how to defend against it. We executed 10 experiments simulating telephone phishing attacks, administered to 3,000 work phones of university staff and faculty over a workweek. The results were collected from the inputs and survey responses of the recipients. We analyzed the data using linear regression and statistical hypothesis testing methods, identifying at least one attribute with a significant effect. We discussed effective prevention strategies, emphasizing the importance of targeting impersonation and fostering vigilance.
