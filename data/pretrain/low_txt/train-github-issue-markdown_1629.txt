We would like to introduce a replacement for `@Valid` that supports group classes for JSR-303 validation. Currently, only the default group class of JSR-303 constraints is executed when using `@Valid`.

For more details, please refer to the following forum thread:
- [Forum Thread: Request for Group Class Support in @Valid](http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?p=292566)

- **SWF-1453**: Support JSR303 Validation Groups for Webflow View States ( _ **"is depended on by"**_ )
- **#11039**: Support for validation groups in `@Valid` used by Spring MVC ( _ **"duplicates"**_ )

This request aims to enhance the functionality of `@Valid` by allowing the use of specific validation groups, thereby providing more granular control over the validation process.
