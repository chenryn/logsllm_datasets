## Introduction
This project presents a low-cost quadrotor designed for global security applications, utilizing modified digital cameras to capture and transmit real-time visual data. The system is intended to provide a cost-effective solution for surveillance and reconnaissance.

## Flight of the Bumblebee
### One for Fun
- **Observation**: Look at it when it flies... or see from its eyes.
- **Development**: Many experiments were conducted before achieving success.

### Two for Stereo
- **Stereo Vision**: Two cameras provide two points of view, allowing for depth perception through the difference in the images.

### Three for Headaches
- **Complexity**: The need for simultaneous vertical and side views of scenes introduces additional challenges, such as creating mosaics.

## Taming of the Camera
### On-the-Shelf Benefits & Drawbacks
- **Benefits**:
  - Professional optical systems with stabilizers.
  - Integrated storage and battery.
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Large and heavy.
  - Designed for human use, not optimal for robotic integration.

### Slash & Hack
- **Weight Reduction**: Initial weight out of the box: 145 g (5.1 oz). Unnecessary components were removed to minimize weight.
- **Remote Control**: Effective remote control and precise time-stamping for each picture.
- **Electronics Integration**: More electronics were added to ensure the system operates on the same logic, specifically TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) at 3.3V.
- **Hacking Conclusion**: Full control over the digital camera, automatic triggering, and precise picture time-stamping (20 ms).

## Views from Up-There
### Field Tests and Demonstrations
- **French Navy Academy (July 2008)**: Presentation of the quadrotor's flying capabilities to navy students.
- **Challenge Minidrones Contest (Winter 2007 - May 2009)**: Funded by ONERA and DGA, the team achieved third place among thirteen teams.
- **Natural History Museum (June 2009)**: Field test in Fontainebleau forest to validate simultaneous acquisition of pictures.

## Flight Demo
- **Demo Availability**: We hope to bring our quadrotor through US customs and would be glad to provide a flight demo if possible.

## Summary
- **Key Points**:
  - Keep it simple, stupid.
  - Use integrated systems when possible.
  - Cameras are very sensitive to high-frequency vibrations.
  - Provide useful information about the quadrotor's status.
  - Create nice movies for recreation or exploration.
  - Produce images that can be analyzed by a PhD student.
  - Wait for experience return to further refine the system.

## Thanks
We thank you for your attention.
