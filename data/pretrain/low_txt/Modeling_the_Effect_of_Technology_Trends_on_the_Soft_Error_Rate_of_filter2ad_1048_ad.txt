### SRAM and Latch Soft Error Rate (SER) Analysis

The SER per chip for SRAM remains relatively stable, as the percentage of chip area allocated to SRAM changes minimally. The SER per chip in latches increases slightly across all pipeline depths, a combined effect of the nearly constant SER per latch and the increasing number of latches at smaller feature sizes. For deeper pipelines, the SER per chip in latches rises due to the greater number of latches required.

### Combinational Logic SER Analysis

The SER per chip in combinational logic increases dramatically from 600nm to 50nm, rising from \(10^{-7}\) to approximately \(10^2\), or nine orders of magnitude. This increase is due to a \(10^6\) rise in SER per individual logic chain and a more than 100-fold increase in the number of logic chains per chip. At 50nm with a 6 FO4 pipeline, the SER per chip of logic exceeds that of latches and is within two orders of magnitude of the SER per chip of unprotected memory elements. Mainstream microprocessors from Intel [14] and other vendors [17] have employed ECC to reduce the SER of SRAM caches at feature sizes up to 350nm. For processors using ECC to protect a large portion of the memory elements, logic will quickly become the dominant source of soft errors.

### Discussion

Our study primarily focuses on establishing the basic trend in SER of combinational logic and the major influences on this trend. Our model considers the effects of device scaling and superpipelining trends, and their corresponding effects on electrical and latching window masking. This section discusses additional factors that may influence the SER of combinational logic but are not included in our model to simplify its construction and analysis.

#### Circuit Implementations

We restricted our analysis to static combinational logic circuits and level-sensitive latches. Modern microprocessors often employ a diverse set of circuit styles, including dynamic logic, latched domino logic, and various latches such as edge-triggered flip-flops, each with different performance, power, area, and noise margin characteristics. We believe our model could be extended to include these additional circuit styles and latch designs. The use of dynamic logic can substantially increase the SER, as each gate has built-in state that can reinforce an error pulse. Edge-triggered flip-flops, which generally have a larger critical charge, should have a lower SER. These points highlight the importance of design choices on overall SER.

#### Logical Masking

Logical masking is another masking effect that inhibits soft errors in combinational logic and can significantly affect the SER. Since our model places every logic gate on an active path to a latch, we do not account for logical masking. Incorporating logical masking would likely increase the model's complexity, as it would need to consider actual circuits and associated inputs. Massengill et al. developed a specialized VHDL simulator to analyze soft faults in actual circuits and model the effects of logical masking [20]. They found that the effect of logical masking on SER depends heavily on circuit inputs.

Similar effects can occur in memory elements. For example, if a soft error occurs in a memory element holding dead data (data that will not be used again), it is logically masked. Another example is a soft error in a memory structure like a branch predictor, which may reduce performance but not produce incorrect results. Due to the difficulty in modeling these effects, we have excluded all forms of logical masking in memory elements or logic from our model. However, it seems unlikely that logical masking will be significantly affected by the technology trends considered in this study.

#### Alpha Particles

Our study only considers soft errors resulting from high-energy neutrons. Another important source of soft errors in microprocessors is alpha particles, which originate from radioactive decay of impurities in chip and packaging materials. For circuits with \(CR \cdot T\) in the range of 10-40 fC, the alpha particle SER becomes comparable to neutron SER [9]. In our experiments, this range corresponds to SRAM cells and latches in 180nm and later technologies and logic circuits in 50nm and later technologies. Our model could be adapted to estimate the SER due to alpha particle radiation.

### Related Work

Although this is the first paper to model the effect of both technology scaling and superpipelining on the soft error rate of combinational logic, previous experimental work has estimated the soft error rate of storage and combinational logic in existing technologies [25, 6, 16, 19, 24]. Another method for estimating the neutron-induced SER uses the Modified Burst Generation Rate model [31]. IBM developed the SEMM (Soft-Error Monte Carlo Modeling) program to determine whether chip designs meet SER specifications [23]. The program calculates the SER of semiconductor chips due to ionizing radiation based on detailed layout, process information, and circuit (\(CR \cdot T\)) values.

Some work has also been done to estimate the SER in combinational logic. Liden et al. compared the soft error rate due to direct particle strikes in latches with the soft error rate from error pulses propagating through logic gates [19]. They concluded that errors are predominantly due to direct strikes to latches, with only 2% of total observed errors from the logic chain. We have shown how technology trends will lead to a significant increase in the SER at low feature sizes and high clock rates. Baze et al. studied electrical masking in a chain of inverters and concluded that for pulses that successfully get latched, electrical masking does not have any significant effect on SER [2]. Our results show that electrical masking does have a significant effect on the SER, and this effect is not diminishing with decreased feature size. Buchner et al. investigated latching window masking in combinational and sequential logic [5]. They concluded that while the SER of sequential logic is independent of frequency, combinational logic SER increases linearly with clock rate. Our results confirm that the trend of increasing clock rate due to increased processor pipelining significantly increases the SER of logic circuits.

Seifert et al. used experiments and simulation to determine the trend of soft error rate in the family of Alpha processors [28]. They concluded that the alpha particle susceptibility of both logic and memory circuits has decreased over the last few process generations. Our study shows an increasing susceptibility to neutron-induced soft errors, particularly in logic circuits, due to device scaling and greater neutron flux at lower energies [32]. They also found that errors in combinational logic are predominantly due to direct strikes to pipeline latches rather than error propagation in logic. Our simulations agree with this result at current feature sizes but predict that the SER of logic will approach the SER of latches as feature sizes decrease. They also concluded that for a given feature size, clock rate has little influence on SER. The results we present in Figure 7 are consistent with this conclusion.

### Conclusion

We have presented an analysis of how two key trends in microprocessor technology—device scaling and superpipelining—will affect the susceptibility of microprocessor circuits to soft errors. The primary impact of device scaling is that the on-currents of devices decrease and circuit delay decreases. As a result, particles of lower energy, which are far more plentiful, can generate sufficient charge to cause a soft error. Using a combination of simulations and analytical models, we demonstrated that this results in a much higher SER in microprocessor logic circuits as feature size decreases. We also demonstrate that higher clock rates used in superpipelined designs lead to an increase in the SER of logic circuits in all technology generations.

The primary cause of the significant increase in the SER of logic circuits is the reduction in critical charge of logic circuits with decreased feature size. Our analysis also illustrates the effect of technology trends on electrical and latching-window masking, which provide combinational logic with a form of natural protection against soft errors. We found that electrical masking has a significant effect on the SER of logic circuits in all technology generations, and this effect is not diminishing with feature size. The effect of latching-window masking is also important but is reduced by both decreasing feature size and increased clock rate of future technology generations. We conclude that current technology trends will lead to a substantially more rapid increase in the soft error rate in combinational logic than in storage elements. The implication of this result is that further research is required into methods for protecting combinational logic from soft errors.

Recently, several schemes have been proposed to detect or recover from transient errors in processor computations. These techniques are either based on space redundancy (e.g., [1]) or time redundancy (e.g., [22, 26, 27]). We believe that techniques such as these, combined with circuit and process innovations, will be required to enable the future construction of reliable high-performance systems. Our work is significant because it provides a context for evaluating these various techniques on their effectiveness at reducing soft errors in combinational logic.
