### Project Localization and Idea Circulation

For a project to be successfully localized, it must be adopted by someone who can champion its implementation. Deirdre Ni Raghallaigh emphasizes that while some projects have great potential, they may not come to fruition due to budget constraints or competition from other projects. She stresses the importance of circulating ideas to gain an audience: "It’s crucial to keep ideas circulating so they catch on. The more people exposed to them, the more likely they are to happen."

An ecology of innovation approach recognizes that ideas need time to circulate and be accepted before they can become reality. This process ensures that multiple perspectives are incorporated, fine-tuning the project to local needs while maintaining a broader scope. For The Studio, collaborating with the IwB increased visibility for local projects, fostering organizational synergies and wider local debate. This demonstrates that innovation is not just about generating ideas and creating tools, but also about establishing onsite and virtual spaces where these ideas can be harnessed and propagated.

### Conclusion

Sabrina Dominguez, a student at the IwB working on the Dublin Project, describes The Studio as a department that maintains a strategic distance from other municipal departments, keeping "a foot in and out of city operations." Susan Speigel, a Toronto-based architect and IwB advisor, states, "The Studio is like a COLAB, a think tank that acts as a bridge between the municipality, citizens, and industry, providing a space for municipal employees to innovate from the inside." This fringe positioning, which bridges social, political, business, technical, and design aspects, is key to fostering lasting innovation in public service.

A design studio serves as an advisory body capable of researching, organizing, presenting, and circulating new concepts in public service. It facilitates debate and proposes solutions among the government, community, industry, non-profits, and other design studios. Importantly, it is also a place where new ideas can be presented, stored, and circulated.

While there are significant differences between Markham and Dublin, both case studies highlight the role of The Studio in implementing new ideas. Markham, a new municipality, faces typical edge-city problems, whereas Dublin, one of Europe's oldest cities, is dense, diverse, and politically complex. However, both cities benefit from The Studio's efforts. Through the Dublin Project, The Studio has gained ground in implementing many new ideas, and the City of Markham is considering a change lab as a permanent feature following the COLAB Project.

Municipal governments are recognizing that better relationships with citizens and industry can improve city processes. Today's municipal leaders see the necessity of interdisciplinary design studio collaborations to build and pilot solutions to city challenges. This requires an open attitude. Participants in the Dublin Project and COLAB Project emphasized that the city managers of Markham and Dublin created an environment of respect and curiosity, being open to innovative ideas and willing to take risks. Design can act as a bridge, synergizing different stakeholders for lasting social innovation in public service. However, this process is not immediate; it requires continuous public debate, circulation of ideas, and a space where they can be cultivated to drive change.

### Implications for Design Practice and Education

An ecology of innovation approach is inclusive, enhancing project viability by placing social innovation in a context where synergies can flourish. By co-creating with the public, clients, sponsors, and professionals from various disciplines, holistic propositions can be developed into formats that society can adopt. Design studios must engage in deeper research that considers an ecology of innovation in each project. Collaboration with other design studios, think tanks, and non-profits enhances projects by diversifying the conceptual ground from which ideas emerge.

Design education must evolve technologically and methodologically. While practical training and historical context are important, design education should also focus on method. Flexible curriculums can incorporate student feedback and real-world partnerships, forcing the development of new methods, tools, and strategies. The IwB’s Interdisciplinary Design Strategy Program curriculum emphasizes immersion in projects and professionalization, with ongoing contact with clients, accountability for deliverables, and integration with a global network of experts.

### Policymaking

The Studio in Dublin and the proposal for a COLAB in Markham demonstrate the advantages of interdisciplinary hubs working with municipalities. These labs are new phenomena in public service design, but an increasing number of municipalities globally are looking to harness interdisciplinary and design thinking methodologies to address complex challenges with limited budgets. Collaboration with design schools and studios can invigorate public policy, strengthen internal communication, and develop new relationships with citizens, industry, and other city organizations. A forward-thinking and anticipatory public sector should be open to new methods that better equip it to face multi-directional and multi-faceted challenges affecting citizens' lives.

### Chapter 4: Collaborative Design Methods and Tools

#### 1. The Teen Art Park Project: Envisioning Spaces for Artistic Expression and Social Sustainability
**Mariana Amatullo**

This essay presents the Teen Art Park Project as a case study of a collaborative public sector design endeavor that includes planning for a recreational environment intended to serve disadvantaged teenagers with structures co-designed to foster safe, artistic expression. Insights about tools and design research methods that foster collaboration with a multiplicity of stakeholders and amplify social innovation outcomes are offered.

**Abstract**
Today, policymakers, community leaders, designers, and educators recognize the challenge of creating public spaces that build flourishing, inclusive communities and promote a sense of belonging, local identity, and social networks. The Teen Art Park project addresses this challenge by proposing a community-driven vision for a dynamic public venue with innovative infrastructure and arts programming benefiting underserved populations of teens in Pasadena and Altadena, California.

**Vision & Design Brief**
The concept was simple: an innovative arts center for at-risk youth, a place where teenagers could not only escape their problems but also be encouraged to deal with them through the arts. The park concept was developed during a two-term trans-disciplinary studio led by the Environmental Design Department in the 2011 spring and summer academic terms. It was born over months of conversation among twenty-nine community partners, including the Flintridge Center, the Armory Center for the Arts, Learning Works! Charter school, Day One, and the project initiator, the Designmatters Department at Art Center College of Design.

The design brief called for students from environmental design, product design, illustration, and graphic design to consider and create alternative positive environments for youth to explore various forms of art-making activities. Over the two core academic terms, students formed small teams and worked in the first studio to develop their ideas.
