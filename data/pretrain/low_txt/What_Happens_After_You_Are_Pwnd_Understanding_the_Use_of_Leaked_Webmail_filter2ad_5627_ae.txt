### Owner Behavior Monitoring and Anomaly Detection

Over a period of time, the owner's search behavior can be monitored. Any deviation from the usual search patterns would be flagged as anomalous, indicating a potential account compromise. Similarly, anomaly detection systems can be trained on the typical durations of connections during benign usage, with deviations from these norms also being flagged as suspicious.

### Limitations

In our experiments, we encountered several limitations. For instance, we were only able to leak honey accounts through a few outlets, such as paste sites, underground forums, and malware. Specifically, we could only target underground forums that were open to the public and offered free registration. Additionally, we were unable to study some of the most recent families of information-stealing malware, like Dridex, because they did not execute in our virtual environment. Attackers might also find and remove the monitoring scripts we hid in the honey accounts, making it impossible for us to track their activities. This is an inherent limitation of our monitoring architecture. However, online service providers like Google and Facebook, with full access to system logs, could perform similar studies without the need for monitoring scripts, thus preventing attackers from evading scrutiny. Finally, while evaluating what cybercriminals were searching for in the honey accounts, we could only observe the emails they found interesting, not everything they searched for, due to our lack of access to the complete search logs.

### Future Work

In the future, we plan to further explore the ecosystem of stolen accounts and gain a deeper understanding of the underground economy surrounding them. We aim to make the decoy accounts more believable to attract and engage more cybercriminals. We also intend to set up additional scenarios, such as studying attackers with specific motivations, such as compromising accounts belonging to political activists rather than generic corporate accounts. Additionally, we will investigate whether demographic information and the language of the emails influence how cybercriminals interact with these accounts. To address the limitation of only identifying search terms for emails found in the accounts, we plan to seed the honey accounts with specially crafted emails containing decoy sensitive information, such as fake bank account details and login credentials, alongside regular email messages. This should increase the variety of hits when cybercriminals search for content, thereby improving our insights into their search behaviors.

### Related Work

In this section, we briefly compare our work with previous research, noting that most prior studies focused on spam and social spam, with only a few examining manual hijacking of accounts and their activity.

**Bursztein et al. [13]** investigated the manual hijacking of online accounts through phishing pages. Their study focused on cybercriminals who steal user credentials and use them privately, showing that manual hijacking is less common than automated hijacking by botnets. Our work, in contrast, analyzed a broader threat model, including account credentials automatically stolen by malware and the behavior of cybercriminals who obtain account credentials through underground forums and paste sites. By focusing on multiple types of miscreants, we were able to highlight differences in their modus operandi and provide multiple insights into the activities on hijacked Gmail accounts. We also provided an open-source framework for other researchers to set up similar experiments, making our infrastructure the first publicly available Gmail honeypot system.

**Thomas et al. [34]** and **Stringhini et al. [31]** studied abuse of accounts on social networks, focusing on Twitter and Facebook, respectively. They developed tools for detecting spam and malicious activity. **Wang et al. [37]** proposed using click event patterns to identify fake accounts in online services. Unlike these studies, which focus on fake accounts, our work examines legitimate accounts that have been hijacked.

**Egele et al. [18]** and **Stringhini et al. [32]** developed systems to detect compromised accounts using statistical models and behavioral modeling. **Liu et al. [25]** and **Nikiforakis et al. [26]** investigated the use of stolen credentials and files by setting up honeyfiles. While these studies used similar approaches, they focused more on P2P networks and file hosting services, respectively, whereas our work concentrates on compromised accounts in webmail services.

**Stone-Gross et al. [30]** studied large-scale spam operations by analyzing C&C servers of the Pushdo/Cutwail botnet, highlighting the capability of connecting to webmail accounts to send spam. They also described the activity of cybercriminals on underground forums, showing that they actively traded account information. In our work, we used a similar approach to leak account credentials on underground forums.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a honey account system capable of monitoring the activities of cybercriminals who gain access to Gmail account credentials. Our system is publicly available to encourage further research and improve the community's understanding of what happens after webmail accounts are compromised. We leaked 100 honey accounts on paste sites, underground forums, and virtual machines infected with malware, providing detailed statistics and a taxonomy of the criminals. Our findings help the research community better understand the ecosystem of stolen online accounts and potentially aid in developing better detection systems against such malicious activities.
