### Under shein.co.uk and bitrix24.fr

Shein.co.uk is a UK-based online fashion retailer. Similarly, Bitrix24, a Russian-owned cloud collaboration service, operates under several country code top-level domain (ccTLD) aliases, including bitrix24.fr.

### Churn in Self-Hosted Domains (2017 to 2021)

| Year | Google | Microsoft | Yandex | Top 100 | Self-Hosted | Others | No SMTP |
|------|--------|-----------|--------|----------|-------------|--------|---------|
| 2017 | 518    | 518       | 990    | 990      | 135         | 135    | 1057    |
| 2021 | 1044   | 1044      | 1553   | 1553     | 1057        | 1057   | 1044    |

### Figure 8: Mail Provider Preferences by Country (ccTLD)

This figure illustrates the mail provider preferences across different countries. The dominance of providers like Tencent and Yandex in their respective local markets may be attributed to marketing and infrastructure deployment advantages, as well as state-imposed security review requirements that US service providers are unable or unwilling to meet. This results in a heterogeneous centralization of email services globally, with certain providers dominating specific markets. Despite these challenges, US-based email service providers have been effective in attracting foreign customers, despite the additional legal risks.

### 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we present a methodology for mapping Internet domains to mail service providers. Our approach combines DNS data with active measurement data to enhance accuracy. We applied this technique to large sets of domains to identify and characterize the current distribution of dominant mail providers. Our longitudinal study over four years has empirically documented the steady consolidation of Internet email services towards a small number of providers. We also explore the role of nationality and legal jurisdiction in mail provisioning decisions.
