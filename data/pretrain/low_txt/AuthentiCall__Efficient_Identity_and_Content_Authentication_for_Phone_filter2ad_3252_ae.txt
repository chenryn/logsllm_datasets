### Authloop and AuthentiCall: A Comparative Analysis

**Authloop** employs a codec-agnostic modem and a TLS-inspired protocol to perform authentication exclusively over the audio channel. While it provides end-to-end authentication for heterogeneous phone calls, it has several limitations compared to **AuthentiCall**:

1. **Bandwidth Constraints**: The limited bandwidth of the audio channel results in slow handshakes, typically requiring an average of 9 seconds.
2. **One-Sided Authentication**: Authloop only supports one-sided authentication, meaning only one party can be verified.
3. **Content Authentication**: It is not possible to authenticate the content of the call.
4. **Vulnerability to Content Replacement Attacks**: Although Authloop can prevent some forms of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, it is susceptible to attacks that replace the call content.
5. **User Interaction Requirement**: Users must answer all calls before they can be authenticated, as Authloop relies on the audio channel.

**AuthentiCall** overcomes these limitations by leveraging data connections available to call endpoints, providing robust cryptographic authentication for both parties with minimal overhead. Specifically, AuthentiCall offers the following advantages:

1. **Efficient Call Setup**: Adds only a worst-case 1.4 seconds of overhead to the call setup time.
2. **Two-Sided Authentication**: Both call parties are cryptographically authenticated.
3. **Content Protection**: Ensures the integrity and authenticity of the voice call content with high accuracy.
4. **Mitigation of Fraudulent Calls**: Provides a solution to the persistent problem of illicit or fraudulent bulk calls on telephone networks.

### Conclusion

Traditional telephone networks often fail to provide even the most basic guarantees about identity. **AuthentiCall** addresses this issue by protecting voice calls made over these networks. By using now-common data connections, AuthentiCall cryptographically authenticates both call parties and protects the content of the voice call, thereby offering a comprehensive solution to the ongoing problem of fraudulent and illicit calls.
