### Table 6: Connected Components in the Graph Describing Daily Observed Redirection Chains
- **Difficulties and Observations:**
  - Search-redirection attacks experienced significant challenges in 2013, as evidenced in Figure 2.
  - **Network Characteristics:**
    - The graphs consist of all redirection chains on any given day, showing strong network heterogeneity with large connected components dominating the graph.
    - This indicates that the illicit advertising business is dominated by a few large players, consistent with earlier research [15, 21].

### Concentration Over Time
- **Figure 10: Maximum and Average Degree of Traffic Brokers and Destinations Over Time**
  - Plots the maximum (top) and average (bottom) degree of traffic brokers and destinations as a function of time.
  - Each data point represents a 7-day moving average.
  - Vertical lines correspond to events introduced in Section 5.
  - The size of the largest traffic brokers varies drastically over time, with spikes in late 2012 caused by particularly virulent campaigns.
  - Since early 2013, the size of the largest brokers has decreased, reflecting a trend that search-redirection might be less popular than it was in 2012.

### Shared Infrastructure
- **Table 7: Overlap in Criminal Infrastructures (10/31/2011–09/16/2013)**
  - **Type and Granularity of Node:**
    - Drugs
    - Other markets combined
    - Source infection FQDNs
    - Traffic broker domains
    - Traffic broker FQDNs
    - Destination domains
    - Destination FQDNs
  - **Shared # and Jaccard Index:**
    - There is modest overlap between various types of products.
    - Source infections are rarely used for multiple campaigns.
    - Traffic broker domains show more overlap, likely due to lax verification policies at certain hosting providers.
    - At the FQDN level, both destinations and brokers show little evidence of overlap, which is surprising given the known fact that certain botnets operate over multiple markets.

### Key Takeaways
- **Source Infections:**
  - The persistence of source infections has steadily fallen from one month to two weeks.
  - Attackers have adapted by compromising more websites.
- **Traffic Funneling:**
  - Extensive concentration in the funneling of traffic from source infections to destinations via a small number of central brokers.
- **Interventions:**
  - Uncoordinated interventions by individual stakeholders (e.g., search engine ranking algorithm tweaks, cleanup efforts by hosting providers) are not sufficient to disrupt persistent poisoning attempts.
  - Coordinated takedowns at the AS level, in conjunction with the demotion or removal of poisoned search results, could significantly impact the economics of search engine poisoning.
