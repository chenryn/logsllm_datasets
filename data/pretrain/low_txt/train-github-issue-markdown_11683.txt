Upon initially opening the menu, 8 links are clearly visible. However, if you close and then reopen the menu, all the links disappear.

This issue occurs on the Galaxy SIII Mini with Android Jelly Bean 4.1.2 using Chrome in portrait mode. The problem does not appear when using the default browser or in landscape view. I have also encountered this issue on a Galaxy SII with CyanogenMod 10.2 (Android 4.3) and Chrome.

Do you have any thoughts or suggestions on how to resolve this?
