### Federal/Peer Panel of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)

#### Urban Area Self-Assessment Discussion (November 2006 – December 2006)
Discussions were held with each urban/metropolitan area to evaluate their progress in post-Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) exercises and the development of governance structures for long-term interoperability, in accordance with the SAFECOM model.

#### Investments (Fiscal Year 2003 – Fiscal Year 2005)
A total of $2.1 billion in Homeland Security Grants was allocated for communications projects through FY2005.

#### After Action Report/Improvement Plans (August 2006 – November 2006)
Findings from each exercise were compiled, and identified gaps were presented to the urban/metropolitan areas to develop improvement plans.

#### Scorecards (November 2006 – December 2006)
G&T, the WMO, and SAFECOM developed evaluation criteria aligned with the SAFECOM National Baseline Assessment for panels of SMEs to assess each area.

### Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards
As illustrated, the development of a TICP in each urban/metropolitan area was followed by a validation exercise to demonstrate agencies' ability to use TICP procedures with their existing interoperable communications assets. The results of these exercises were provided to the areas to include in improvement plans for future TICP revisions and training efforts. The scorecard summarizes the progress made—from TICP development through the exercise and After Action Reports (AAR)—and provides a foundation for each area's next steps as it continues to enhance its interoperable communications capabilities.

### Scorecard Development Overview
To complete the scorecards, documentation from the G&T TICP process was reviewed, including the TICP, TICP Peer Review, Exercise Evaluation Guide (EEG), AAR, Improvement Plan (IP), and Self-Assessment Discussion. Panels of SMEs, composed of experts with state and local public safety operational and communications technology backgrounds, along with representatives from G&T, SAFECOM, and the WMO, reviewed all key documents to assess Governance, SOPs, and Usage-related information. Five panels of SMEs met over a six-week period to review the documentation for the urban/metropolitan areas. Through a facilitated process, the review panels reached consensus on results, findings, and recommendations for each area. The resulting scorecards will be shared with and can be used by each area to support future investment justifications for improvements to regional interoperable communications.

### Benefits and Results for Urban/Metropolitan Areas
In addition to providing a specific maturity assessment, the scorecard offers recommendations to help urban/metropolitan areas improve their overall communications capability. Technical assistance can then be tailored to address the recommendations identified in each scorecard. The quickest way to achieve meaningful improvement in interoperable communications capabilities is to focus on a strong governance structure, establish and maintain SOPs, and ensure that solutions are used regularly and effectively.

### Core Components of a TICP
The TICP for an urban/metropolitan area identifies specific problems, needs, and barriers to communications among the area’s agencies and disciplines. It identifies potential partners and their roles and responsibilities, inventories the area’s communications resources, and details how those resources would be used to provide fast, on-scene, mission-critical voice communications among all first-responder agencies. The plan must specify a level of communication appropriate for the incident and comply with the incident command system defined in the National Incident Management System (NIMS) model.

### Preliminary Scorecard Findings
The scorecards represent the culmination of extensive data analysis to identify interoperable communications trends, best practices, and other insights useful in guiding both the urban/metropolitan areas and DHS programs. Although more analysis will be necessary, the following sections highlight key general trends and specific findings across the Interoperability Continuum elements.

### General Scorecard Trends
Analysis of the scorecard results provides valuable information for DHS as it improves the assistance provided to state and local agencies. Two common trends across all areas include:
1. Areas developing and/or using shared systems tended to demonstrate more mature governance structures, SOPs, and usage.
2. Areas that diversified their funding sources to address sustained interoperability tended to also have stronger governance structures in place.

### Overall Scorecard Trends
- Policies for interoperable communications are now in place in all 75 urban/metropolitan areas.
- Regular testing and exercises are needed to effectively link disparate systems to allow communications between multi-jurisdictional responders (including State and Federal) during crises.
- The DHS Tactical Interoperable Communications Initiative has played a fundamental role in advancing interoperability in the urban/metropolitan areas.
- Cooperation among first responders in the field is strong, but formalized governance (leadership and planning) across regions has lagged. Governance will be critical in planning for larger-scale, multi-jurisdictional responses and the implementation of next-generation technology.
- Areas that were part of the FY 2005 UASI Grant Program tended to demonstrate greater traction in strategic planning across the region.
- Areas with a history of multijurisdictional cooperation because of prior incidents demonstrated stronger SOPs and Usage.
- Many of the exercises were more complicated in terms of the number and type of participating agencies, providing more insight into the breadth of the SOPs and the depth of Usage. Areas with less complicated exercises and fewer participants scored higher in Usage because the events required less coordination.
- Areas that developed a TICP based on a “bottom-up” approach of a collaborative, regional nature scored higher in Governance than those areas in which a “top-down” state-centric approach was used.

### Governance Findings
Governance measures the maturity of five critical elements: Decision Making Groups, Agreements, Strategic Planning, Interoperability Funding, and Leadership.

**Finding 1: Informal Cooperation Precedes Formal Governance**
While many urban/metropolitan areas are at Intermediate and Established levels of maturity in their regional governance and planning efforts, the first responders and public safety organizations within the region often had been informally cooperating for years. Due to the lack of formal documentation, "Governance" results tended to lag significantly behind "Usage" in the scorecards.

**Finding 2: Pre-existing DHS Urban Area Working Groups**
More than 75 percent of DHS-funded urban areas have developed regional communications committees to address communications interoperability. While some committees focus specifically on the use of federal grant funding for interoperability, others have a broader mandate. Among metropolitan areas, just under half have developed formal committees. In cases where states had strong governance structures, metropolitan areas tended to align their decision-making bodies and strategies with statewide efforts. A communications committee represents a critical step in regional interoperability oversight, but they are not consistently supported in putting formal agreements in place, developing strategic plans, and influencing policy and funding decisions.

**Finding 3: Governance as an Indicator of Advanced Technology and Proficiency**
Urban/metropolitan areas with a formalized and established governance structure demonstrated a higher level of proficiency in interoperable communications equipment usage and generally had more mature SOPs. This proficiency may be due to the larger, more seamless shared systems that correlate with an established regional governance structure.

**Finding 4: Lack of Strategic Plans for Regional Interoperable Communications**
Few urban/metropolitan areas have completed a strategic plan for regional interoperable communications, including sustainable funding plans. In cases where strategic planning processes had begun, it was often noted that the region was developing a plan separate from the operational focus of the TICP.

### Example of Highest and Lowest Governance Maturity for an Urban Area

**Advanced Implementation**
- 9 urban/metropolitan areas received "advanced implementation" in Governance.
- A Communications Committee has been in place for many years and has evolved with new requirements like the TICP.
- A strategic interoperability plan is in place and accepted by all agencies.
- Funding decisions are made on a region-wide basis and have been diversified beyond Federal grants.

**Early Implementation**
- 3 urban/metropolitan areas received "early implementation" in Governance.
- Governance is divided between the city and county, affecting all aspects of interoperability planning.
- The region formed two separate working groups for the development of the TICP—one for the city, the other for the county.
- There is no strategic interoperability plan for the region.
