### Security and Data Integrity in SecSpider

SecSpider ensures the integrity and security of its data through a series of cryptographic measures, starting from when its pollers receive responses from name servers to when a user downloads the data. The following are the key security mechanisms in place:

- **DNS Messages**: All DNS messages, including queries from the coordinator and responses sent by the pollers, are secured using TSIG (Transaction SIGnature) cryptography.
- **Coordinator-Backend Communication**: The coordinator establishes a secure local connection to the backend database.
- **Web-Served DNSKEY Data**: DNSKEY data served via the website is signed with SecSpider’s operational GPG key.
- **DLV Records**: All DLV (DNSSEC Lookaside Validation) records are signed and verifiable using the `dlv.secspider.cs.ucla.edu` DNSKEY.

These security measures ensure that each component of SecSpider communicates securely, which is crucial as the system's components become more loosely coupled. This helps protect against various threats, such as insider attacks or compromised components.

### Data Verification and Presentation

After internal verification of the retrieved data, SecSpider generates a detailed drill-down page for each monitored DNSSEC zone. These pages include monitoring statistics, such as the list of the zone’s DNSKEY records and DS (Delegation Signer) records. The data is presented in HTML format and also available as separate flat files. These files contain the actual RRSIG (Resource Record Signature) values and a list of pollers that observed these values.

The purpose of these files is to allow operators and scripts to easily download and verify the records for any given zone. By comparing the records observed by different pollers, discrepancies can be identified, which may indicate potential attacks. Even if an adversary manages to spoof the results of all SecSpider pollers, the publicly available data allows vigilant zone owners to detect such attacks by periodically checking SecSpider results.

### Global Trust Anchors

All keys that are consistently observed across SecSpider’s pollers over a sufficient period are entered into SecSpider’s global trust-anchors file. This is one of SecSpider’s main contributions, as it provides resolvers with verified DNSKEY records in a readily usable form. Additionally, SecSpider uses its GPG key to cryptographically sign each flat file, allowing users to verify the origin authenticity of the data.

### Database Structure

SecSpider stores all its data in a MySQL relational database. The schema is divided into two major types of tables: DNS tables and statistics tables. The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is shown in Figure 6.

- **DNS Tables**: These tables categorize all DNS RRsets and RRs that SecSpider tracks. Verifiable records, those with valid (i.e., not expired) RRSIG records, are used to maintain the state of DNSSEC-enabled zones. Unverifiable records are used for historical measurements and analysis.
- **Statistics Tables**: These tables track various types of data observed during each run. For example, the `SS_NAMESERVER_STATS` table records the version number and DNSSEC-enablement status of name servers, with each row having an observation date. These tables are transactional and grow over time.

### Implementation Summary

SecSpider has been an operational tool for the DNSSEC community for over three years. As of this writing, the website has served over 2.3 million page views in 2008 alone, and we currently track approximately 18,000 DNS zones. SecSpider pollers operate at several locations worldwide, including NL Net Labs (Netherlands), Colorado State University (US - Central), Tsinghua University (China), and others.

The backend database contains several tables with multi-millions of rows, including tables describing name server statistics, DNSKEY RRset availability, and DNSSEC enablement transitions.

### Monitoring Results

SecSpider has a long history of providing operational insights into DNSSEC behavior. Its data has also been valuable for academic research. Recent events have accelerated DNSSEC adoption, and SecSpider’s data set has proven useful in tracking operational practices and identifying issues such as PMTU (Path MTU Discovery) problems.

### Conclusions and Implications for Operators

A distributed global monitoring system like SecSpider plays a critical role in ensuring the success of DNSSEC deployment. The data is freely available and widely used in the DNSSEC operational community, influencing practices and helping identify challenges and successes. Individual zones are encouraged to track their progress on SecSpider, and the drill-down pages provide a comprehensive view of how their zone is viewed from multiple locations around the world.
