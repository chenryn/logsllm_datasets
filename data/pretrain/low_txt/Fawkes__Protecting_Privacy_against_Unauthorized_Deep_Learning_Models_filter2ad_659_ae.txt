### Methodology

To evaluate the effectiveness of Sybil accounts in protecting user privacy, we use two sets of images: Set A contains cloaked images, and Set B contains original images leaked to the tracker. For each synthetic image of the Sybil, we randomly select an uncloaked image of the user from Set A. We then cloak all candidate images using the methodology discussed in §4, ensuring that the resulting Sybil images mimic the feature space representation of uncloaked user images. From the tracker’s perspective, they have access to cloaked user images from Set A, uncloaked images from Set B, and the Sybil images.

### Results

**Figure 11: Comparison of Protection Success Rates**
- **Description**: This figure compares the protection success rates with and without Sybil accounts, using Web-Incept as the feature extractor for both the user and the tracker.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Using a Sybil account significantly improves the protection success rate, especially when the attacker has a small number of original images.
  - The protection success rate remains above 87% when the ratio of original images owned by the tracker is less than 31%.
  - When the user uploads 2 Sybil images per uncloaked image, the protection success rate increases by 5.5%.

**Joint Optimization of Multiple Feature Extractors**
- **Description**: The user may not know the exact feature extractor used by the tracker. However, given the limited number of face feature extractors available online, the user can jointly optimize Sybil cloaks to simultaneously fool multiple candidate feature extractors.
- **Experiment**:
  - We test this by jointly optimizing Sybil cloaks on four feature extractors from §5 and evaluating their performance when the tracker uses one of these four.
  - **Results**: The average protection success rate remains above 65% when the ratio of original images owned by the tracker is less than 31%.

### Countermeasures

**Inherent Limits on Cloaking Success**
- **Description**: Cloaking becomes less effective when an individual is an active target of a tracker. If a tracker strongly desires to train a model to recognize a certain individual, they can take drastic measures, such as learning the individual's movements or invading their privacy.
- **Assumptions**: Our experiments assume the tracker knows the precise feature extractor used by the user to optimize cloaks. We test our countermeasures on a tracker’s model trained on the FaceScrub dataset, with cloaks generated using the robust VGG2-Dense feature extractor from §5.3.

**Cloak Disruption Techniques**
- **Image Transformation**:
  - **Description**: Techniques such as image augmentation, blurring, or adding noise can be used to disrupt the protection performance of Fawkes.
  - **Results**:
    - **Gaussian Blurring**: Normal classification accuracy degrades by up to 18% as kernel size increases, but the protection success rate remains above 98% (see Figure 13).
    - **Gaussian Noise**: Adding Gaussian noise disrupts normal classification accuracy, but the protection success rate remains above 100% as the standard deviation of the noise distribution increases (see Figure 14).
    - **JPEG Compression**: Even image compression does not defeat the cloak. Progressive JPEG compression, as used by Facebook and Twitter, decreases the protection success rate, but more significantly degrades normal classification accuracy (see Figure 15).

**Robust Model**
- **Description**: Cloaks constructed on robust feature extractors transfer well to trackers’ less robust models, as shown in §5.

### Summary

- **Sybil Accounts**: Significantly improve protection success rates, especially when the tracker has a small number of original images.
- **Joint Optimization**: Allows users to create Sybil cloaks that are effective against multiple feature extractors.
- **Countermeasures**: Techniques like image transformation and robust model training can reduce the effectiveness of cloaking, but cloaks remain highly effective under most conditions.
