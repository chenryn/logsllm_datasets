### Grid Operators and MadIoT Attacks

Grid operators, in general, are not prepared for attacks of this nature. Consequently, these types of attacks are not typically included in the contingency plans of power grid operators. Our first recommendation is for grid operators to incorporate MadIoT (Manipulation of Demand via IoT) attacks into their contingency planning. Such preparations can be integrated directly into their existing day-ahead planning tools to ensure that their systems have sufficient inertia (or spinning reserve) and that power lines have adequate additional capacity to minimize the effects of potential attacks.

Although this may initially increase grid operating costs, the development of more efficient planning tools and the application of recent advances in designing virtual inertia for power systems [32] can help reduce these costs over time. Therefore, our suggestion for system operators is to push for more research in this direction to make their systems more robust against potential MadIoT attacks.

To minimize costs, grid operators should also have an accurate estimate of the total number of high-wattage IoT devices in their system and, accordingly, the scale of a potential attack, without being overly cautious.

Since this is a new type of attack enabled by the ubiquity of IoT devices, our final recommendation for system operators is to revisit their online data and find secure ways to release it without revealing any critical information that could be exploited by an adversary to enhance the effectiveness of an attack.

### IoT Security Challenges

The security challenges facing IoT devices are significantly more complex to address. There are multiple ways an adversary can gain access to a smart appliance. An adversary can directly access the device, or they can access the mobile phone, tablet, or thermostat that controls the device. With the widespread use of digital home assistant devices such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home, an adversary can control smart appliances by gaining access to these devices. Any of these devices can serve as a breach point for an adversary. Therefore, coherent security measures are needed to protect almost all devices within a home network against adversaries.

Thus, on the IoT side, more research is required to study the vulnerabilities of IoT devices and networks and to protect them against cyber attacks.

### Related Work

The security and vulnerability of IoT devices against cyber attacks have been extensively studied [21, 42, 45, 50, 53, 57, 63]. In a recent study of the DDoS attack by the Mirai botnet [12], Antonakakis et al. demonstrated that due to poor security measures in IoT devices, such as easily guessable default passwords, an attacker could gain access to approximately 600,000 devices, including cameras, DVRs, and routers, in a very short period. Similar studies had previously shown that Honeywell home controllers (including thermostats) could be easily compromised due to a pair of bugs in their authentication system [6]. Hernandez et al. also showed that the lack of proper hardware protections in Nest thermostats allows attackers to install malicious software on these devices [33]. Pastrana et al. revealed the vulnerability of Arduino Yun microcontrollers—used in some IoT devices—to cyber attacks [47].

In a recent work [64], Zhang et al. demonstrated that home assistant devices can be controlled by an adversary using inaudible voice commands. Ronen et al. [49] demonstrated that smart lights within a city can potentially be compromised by creating a worm that affects all the lamps using Zigbee. The security of mobile applications that control IoT devices has also been studied [28, 43]. Fernandes et al. [28] comprehensively analyzed the security of all Samsung-owned SmartThings apps and demonstrated that due to security flaws in these applications, they could perform attacks like disabling the vacation mode of a smart home. Naveed et al. [43] also demonstrated that malicious apps on Android devices can freely mis-bond with any external IoT devices and control them.

Power systems' vulnerability to failures and attacks has been widely studied in recent years [14, 17, 18, 23, 54]. Garcia et al. [29] introduced Harvey, malware that affects power grid control systems and can execute malicious commands. Theoretical methods for detecting cyber attacks on power grids and recovering information after such attacks have also been developed [15, 20, 37, 39, 40, 55]. However, most previous work has focused on attacks that directly target the power grid's physical infrastructure or its control system.

The interdependency between failures in power grids and communication networks, and their propagation, has also been recently studied [16, 38, 46], but these works focused on attacks and failures that target both the power grid's and the communication network's physical infrastructure simultaneously.

Load-altering attacks on smart meters and large cloud servers were first introduced by Mohsenian et al. [41]. Their work primarily focused on the cost of protecting the grid against such attacks at loads. In contrast, we have analyzed the consequences of such attacks and introduced practical ways they can be performed. Amini et al. [11] have also recently studied the effects of load-altering attacks on the dynamics of the system and ways to use the system's frequency as feedback to improve an attack. In two recent papers, Dvorkin and Sang [24] and Dabrowski et al. [19] independently revealed the possibility of exploiting compromised IoT devices to disrupt the normal operation of the power grid. Dvorkin and Sang [24] modeled their attack as an optimization problem for the attacker—with complete knowledge of the grid—to cause circuit breakers to trip in the distribution network. In contrast, we have focused on black-box attacks on transmission networks. Dabrowski et al. [19] studied the effect of demand increases caused by remotely activating CPUs, GPUs, hard disks, screen brightness, and printers on the frequency of the European power grid. To the best of our knowledge, the work presented in this paper provides the most comprehensive and coherent study on the effects of potential attacks on the power grid using high-wattage IoT devices.

There is another line of research that focuses on the privacy of customers in the presence of smart power meters, which is beyond the scope of our paper [30].

### Limitations and Future Work

In this work, we have analyzed the potential consequences of MadIoT attacks on the operation of the power grid. However, our study has some limitations, and addressing these can provide a clearer picture of the threats facing the grid now and in the future. First, as mentioned in Section 4, we have only used publicly available datasets, which may not accurately reflect the characteristics of all existing power grids. Therefore, the number of bots listed in Table 2 may not be sufficient to cause significant damage to all power grids. More detailed analysis of MadIoT attacks should be performed by system operators with access to the details of their systems.

Second, in our studies, we have not fully considered the existing control mechanisms for minimizing the subsequent effects of an initial failure (e.g., preventive load-shedding mechanisms). Hence, our cascading failure analysis may only reflect the worst-case scenario.

Third, some high-wattage IoT devices, like air conditioners, have very large capacitors, which take 10 to 15 seconds to reach their maximum capacities. Therefore, it might be challenging to cause an abrupt increase in demand and a subsequent sudden drop in frequency using these devices. Nevertheless, other smart devices like water heaters, which are resistive loads, can still be used for such purposes. Moreover, other varieties of MadIoT attacks that do not require synchronicity on the scale of seconds (e.g., line failures) can still be performed using air conditioners.

Finally, unlike DDoS attacks, for MadIoT attacks, the IoT bots must be geographically located within the boundaries of a power system. Although the numbers of bots in Table 2 are achievable considering recent botnet sizes (e.g., the Mirai botnet), it might be much more challenging to reach these numbers within a targeted geographical location.

### Conclusions

We have studied the collective effects of vulnerable high-wattage IoT devices and have shown that once compromised, an adversary can utilize these devices to perform attacks on the power grid. We have revealed a new class of attacks on the power grid using an IoT botnet called Manipulation of Demand via IoT (MadIoT) attacks. Through state-of-the-art simulators, we have demonstrated that these attacks can result in local outages as well as large-scale blackouts in the power grid, depending on the scale of the attack and the operational properties of the grid. Additionally, we have shown that MadIoT attacks can also be used to increase the operating cost of the grid, benefiting a few utilities in the electricity market.

We hope that our work raises awareness of the significance of these attacks to grid operators, smart appliance manufacturers, and systems security experts, making the power grid (and other interdependent networks) more secure against cyber attacks. This is especially critical in the near future when more smart appliances with the ability to connect to the Internet will be manufactured. Specifically, our work leads to the following recommendations for the research community:

- **Power Systems' Operation:** Power systems' operators should rigorously analyze the effects of potential MadIoT attacks on their systems and develop preventive methods to protect their systems. Initiating a data-sharing platform between academia and industry may expedite these developments in the future.
- **IoT Security:** As shown by both the presented MadIoT attacks and the Mirai botnet, insecure IoT devices can have devastating consequences that go far beyond individual security/privacy losses. This necessitates a rigorous pursuit of the security of IoT devices, including regulatory frameworks.
- **Interdependency:** Our work demonstrates that interdependency between infrastructure networks may lead to hidden vulnerabilities. System designers and security analysts should explicitly study threats introduced by interdependent infrastructure networks such as water, gas, transportation, communication, power grid, and several other networks.
