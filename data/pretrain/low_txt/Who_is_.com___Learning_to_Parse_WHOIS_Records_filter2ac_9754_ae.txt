### 6.3 Privacy Protection

From Section 6.1, we observed that the use of privacy protection services is increasing over time. Overall, 20% of all .com domains use a privacy protection service. Table 7 presents the top 10 privacy protection services as reported in WHOIS records, both in terms of the number of .com domains registered through their service and as a percentage of all domains using privacy protection. We identify privacy protection services by matching a small set of keywords against the registrant name and/or organization fields in WHOIS records. These keywords were developed by reviewing lists of records sorted by registrants and organizations, which stand out due to their association with many domains.

The most prominent privacy protection service is Domains By Proxy, owned by the founder of GoDaddy, and it accounts for 36% of protected .com domains. Although there is a long tail of service names, the top 10 account for 73% of protected domains. However, the names used in WHOIS records for protected domains do not always correspond to identifiable organizations (e.g., "Private Registration," "Hidden by Whois Privacy Protection Service"). This suggests that further exploration of the use, identity, and operation of these services, as well as the registrants of those services [3], could be an interesting open topic.

Table 6 shows the top 10 registrars through which privacy-protected domains have been registered. The registrars used largely mirror the list of all .com domains in Table 5.11

### 6.4 Blacklisted Domains

Domain blacklists are a common source for identifying abusive domains. As a final survey, we examine the WHOIS records for .com domains listed on the Domain Block List (DBL).12 Note that the DBL is populated with domains that appear in spam. Since domains in other TLDs are often cheaper than .com, .com domains represent only a portion (46%) of all domains on the DBL. However, analyzing .com domains provides insight into trends revealed by WHOIS features. We focus on domains created in 2014 to minimize domain expiration; 58.8% of .com domains on the DBL were created in 2014, so this set represents the bulk of .com domains on the DBL.

Table 8 shows the top 10 registrant countries for .com domains on the DBL. Comparing with the countries for all domains in Table 3, both the percentages and rank orderings differ notably for domains on the blacklist. In particular, registrants from Japan, China, and Vietnam are more pronounced.

Table 9 shows the top 10 registrars through which .com domains on the DBL are registered. Comparing with the registrars for all domains in Table 5, the results show some interesting differences. Registrars implicated in abuse (e.g., eNom, Xin Net) are more prominent, and new registrars appear on the top list (e.g., Moniker, evoPlus, Bizcn.com). These results suggest that, in addition to the registrar, country information would likely be a useful feature for predicting domains used in abuse [6, 11].

### 7. Conclusion

In this paper, we developed a statistical parser for WHOIS records that learns a general model from labeled examples, is easy to maintain, and achieves extremely high accuracy in practice. We demonstrated its utility by providing an initial survey of registration patterns in the .com TLD. Finally, code and data from our study are available at: http://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/projects/whois.

### APPENDIX

#### A. Probabilistic Inference

In this appendix, we describe the essential computations for probabilistic inference in Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). By exploiting the Markov property in CRFs, we can efficiently compute both the log-likelihood in eq. (4) and the most likely label sequence in eq. (5).

First, we consider the normalization factor in eq. (3), whose computation requires summing over the exponentially many label sequences of length T. Let n denote the number of states in the CRF. As a useful shorthand, we define an n×n matrix Mt at each time step t, whose elements are given by:

\[ [M_t]_{ij} = \exp \left( \sum_k \theta_k f_k(y_{t-1} = i, y_t = j, x_t) \right) \]

As previously noted, it is to be understood in eq. (9) that the sum over k at time t = 1 only ranges over those features that do not have any dependence on the argument \( y_{t-1} \). It is then a straightforward exercise to show that the normalization factor in eq. (3) is given by:

\[ Z_\theta(x) = \sum_{ij} [M_1 M_2 \ldots M_T]_{ij} \]

This computation, which involves T matrix-vector products, can be performed in O(n^2 T) operations.

Once the normalization factor in eq. (10) is computed, the log-likelihood in eq. (4) follows immediately. In particular, substituting eq. (2) into eq. (4), we obtain:

\[ L(\theta) = \sum_{r=1}^R \left( \sum_{t,k} \theta_k f_k(y_r^{t-1}, y_r^t, x_r^t) - \log Z_\theta(x_r) \right) \]

Eq. (11) gives the log-likelihood \( L(\theta) \) explicitly as a function of the model parameters \(\theta\). To optimize these parameters, it is necessary to compute the gradient \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta}\). This can be done using the forward-backward algorithm for CRFs, which involves a simple extension of the procedure for computing the normalization factor \( Z_\theta(x) \). In particular, the elements of the gradient are closely related to the marginal probabilities of the distribution in eq. (2). For example, these are given by:

\[ \Pr_\theta(y_{t-1} = \ell, y_t = m | x) = \frac{1}{Z_\theta(x)} \sum_{ij} [M_1 \ldots M_{t-1}]_{i\ell} [M_t \ldots M_T]_{mj} \]

We refer the reader to the classic treatment [15] of CRFs for more details.

Finally, we show how to compute the most likely sequence of labels in eq. (5). The computation is simplified by working in the log-domain and noting that the normalization factor \( Z_\theta(x) \) is independent of y. From these considerations, we obtain the simpler expression:

\[ y^* = \arg \max_y \left( \sum_{t,k} \theta_k f_k(y_{t-1}, y_t, x_t) \right) \]

The computation in eq. (13) is a straightforward exercise in dynamic programming. We introduce an n×T matrix V and define its first column by:

\[ V_{i1} = \sum_k \theta_k f_k(y_1 = i, x_1) \]

Then we fill in the matrix elements recursively, one column at a time, as follows:

\[ V_{jt} = \max_i \left( V_{i,t-1} + \sum_k \theta_k f_k(i, j, x_t) \right) \]

In terms of this matrix, the most likely label at time T is simply given by \( y_T^* = \arg \max_i V_{iT} \). To derive the most likely labels at earlier times, we only need to record the index used at each step of the recursion in eq. (15). In particular, let:

\[ \text{INDEX}_t(j) = \arg \max_i \left( V_{i,t-1} + \sum_k \theta_k f_k(i, j, x_t) \right) \]

Then in terms of these indices, the most likely labels at all earlier times are derived from the backtracking procedure:

\[ y_t^* = \text{INDEX}_{t+1}(y_{t+1}^*) \]

Finally, we note that this computation for the most likely labels \( y_t^* \) can also be performed in O(n^2 T) operations.
