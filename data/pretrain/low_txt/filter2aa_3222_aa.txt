## Case Studies

### Fail #1: The "Wasn't Me" Defense
- **Case Details:**
  - Bob, a sales employee at Acme, resigned and joined a competitor.
  - Allegation: Bob took Acme's company list with him.
  
- **Examination:**
  - Bob claimed, "I've got nothing to hide. Come at me bros!"
  - Imaging the drive and planning the examination:
    - Look for deleted files in unallocated space
    - Check 'recent files' used by common programs (Word, Excel)
    - Identify USB device insertion

- **Findings:**
  - Bob used a data destruction program to overwrite every byte of unallocated space on his drive.
  - The pattern used was not typical of normal Windows operation, suggesting possible willful destruction of evidence.

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Data destruction software can almost always be detected.
  - Even if a non-repeating pattern is used, it is still detectable.
  - While we may not know what was destroyed, we can confirm that something was destroyed.
  - Hostile language can negatively impact perceptions.

### Fail #2: The Nickelback Guy
- **Case Details:**
  - John, an employee at NOCFED, left after 3 years to work for a competitor.
  - Allegation: John took confidential documents to the new employer.

- **Examination:**
  - Found confidential documents as expected.
  - Noticed a large number of MP3s, which were actually .avi files with renamed filenames.
  - These files contained explicit content (PREGGER PORN).

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Examiners see files in a long list, not in a folder/tree structure.
  - File Signature Analysis compares file contents with their extensions.
  - Any discrepancy is flagged for closer analysis.
  - John's attempt to hide content made it more conspicuous.

### Fail #3: Just Bill Me Later
- **Case Details:**
  - ABC Firm outsourced a key part of their business, receiving hourly bills amounting to several million dollars per year.
  - Suspected tasks were taking too long, leading to a bill review project.

- **Examination:**
  - Thousands of PDF invoices provided little help.
  - Located billing database on the vendorâ€™s network and forensically copied it.
  - Migrated the database to MSSQL and reverse-engineered the tables.
  - Discovered audit logs were turned on, showing time and rate inflation.

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Audit logs are off by default but can be turned on by IT personnel.
  - Audit logs are the best evidence of theft in a database case.
  - Do not turn on audit logs if you plan to cheat your client.

### Fail #4: Smoking Gun.txt
- **Case Details:**
  - Another intellectual property case where an employee left to work for a competitor.
  - Allegation: Employee took company data.

- **Examination:**
  - Imaged the drive and ran standard analysis scripts.
  - Opened the Desktop folder and found a folder containing data from the previous employer.
  - Bonus: A PowerPoint presentation to bring new colleagues up to speed.

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Sometimes, people do not even try to hide their actions.

### Fail #5: Hiding in the Cloud
- **Case Details:**
  - Top sales guy left the company, and sales plummeted.
  - Suspected he took the customer list but could not prove it.

- **Examination:**
  - Searched IE history and found a .htm file with JavaScript pointing to "filesanywhere.com."
  - Recovered account ID, upload times, and file names, confirming the theft.

- **Recovered FilesAnywhere Information:**
