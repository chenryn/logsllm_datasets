## Why TPC-E?
- **TPC-C Limitations:**
  - Over 14 years old and not practical to modify.
  - Transactions are too lightweight by today's standards.
  - CPU performance has grown according to Moore's Law, but disk latency has not.
- **TPC-E Goals:**
  - Reduce the cost and complexity of running benchmarks.
  - Encourage more representative database uses that reflect customer needs.

## TPC-E vs. DBT-5
- **TPC-E:**
  - A benchmarking specification for generating marketing collateral.
- **DBT-5:**
  - A test kit designed to help improve PostgreSQL.

## TPC-E Overview
### Goals
- **OLTP Database-centric Workload:**
  - Ensure comparability of results.
  - Use a familiar business model (financial market) for ease of understanding.
  - Reduce the cost of running the benchmark.
  - Enhance schema complexity.
  - Be more representative of what customers do.

### Business Model – Financial Market
- **Comparison with TPC-C:**
  - **TPC-C:**
    - Wholesale supplier
    - Organized by warehouses, districts, and customers
  - **TPC-E:**
    - Brokerage house
    - Organized by customers, accounts, and securities

### Database Schema
- **TPC-E:**
  - 39 tables
  - 892 columns
  - 23 minimum columns per table
  - 42 maximum columns per table
  - Data types: VARCHAR, CHAR, NUMERIC, DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP, UUID, BOOL
  - Primary keys: 38
  - Foreign keys: 509
  - Tables with foreign keys: 277
  - Check constraints: 220
  - Referential integrity: Yes
  - Integrity: Yes

### Scaling
- **Tables:**
  - Customer, Broker, Market, Account_Permission, Broker_Company, Sector, Customer_Cash_Transaction, Company_Competitor, Security, Customer_Account, Customer_Tax_Rate, Commission_Rate, Daily_Market, Holdings, Settlement, Financial_Dimension, Holding_History, Trade, Industry_Address, Last_Trade, Status_Type, Watch_Item, Watch_List, Trade_Request, News_Item, News_Xref, Zip_Code
  - **Legend:**
    - Fixed Tables
    - Growing Tables
    - Scaling Tables

### Transactions
- **Metrics:**
  - **Performance (throughput):** Expressed in tpsE
  - **Price/Performance:** Expressed in price/tpsE
  - **Availability Date:** When all products necessary to achieve the stated performance will be available

### Sample Test Configurations
- **Configuration Variations:**
  - Detailed configurations are provided for different test scenarios.

### Highlights and Benefits
- **Financial Business Model:**
  - Rich transaction set
  - Diverse, realistic schema
  - Server-centric workload with database focus
  - Realistic application model
  - Rebalanced hardware configuration
  - Specification provides code where sponsor creativity is not being tested

## DBT-5 Architecture
### Loader
- **Database Creation:**
  - Vendor-specific
- **Database Population:**
  - Vendor-neutral
  - TPC-E includes a data generator for database loading
  - C++ code to generate data
  - Flat file generation is provided
  - Sponsors can customize the interface
  - **Libpqxx:**
    - C++ API for PostgreSQL
