### The Problem with Passwords
- Passwords are still valuable compared to other options, making them the most common in security systems.
- However, their cognitive load is high, primarily due to their vulnerability to observation.

### Observation Attacks
- **Human Interface (External)**
  - Shoulder Surfing
  - Mirrors/Cameras
  - Keypad Dusting
- **Human Interface (Internal)**
  - ATM Skimmers
  - Keyloggers
- **Network**
  - Sniffing
  - Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

### Public Terminals
- **Examples**
  - ATMs
  - Airport Kiosks
  - Door Locks
  - Public Computers
  - Access Control
- **PIN Entry Terminals**
  - Historical Context
    - 1967: The 'Barclaycash' cash dispenser (first cash dispenser, Barclays Bank)
    - 1973: The future tellers and PAT (2010)
  - Interaction History
    - In the past 40 years, ATM terminals have not changed significantly.
    - The interaction with these terminals remains vulnerable to observation attacks.

### Interaction and Security
- **Similar Interfaces**
  - Ideo for BBVA
    - Card
    - Cash
    - Input and Visual
- **Public Threats**
  - Public terminals are dangerous (DeLuca 2010 and Gizmodo)
  - Camera, Observation, Tamper
- **Previous Work**
  - Different password schemes or input methods
    - PIN Entry by Trapdoor Game (Roth et al.)
    - Spy-Resistant Keyboard (Tan et al.)
    - Haptic Passwords (Malek and Sasamoto)
    - Gaze-Based Password (Kumar et al.)

### Basic Considerations
- We need to access public terminals, but it does not mean that the interaction must be done at the terminal.
- The interaction must be different for different people and situations.
- Online interface security is only a minimum standard.
- The interaction must not be limited to the default interface.

### Strategy Shift
- **Before**
  - PIN
- **After**
  - PIN Choice
  - Mediated Input
  - Private Device or Software

### An Alternative Strategy
- Decouple the interaction into two parts:
  - Separate the input method for a PIN from the communication of the password to a terminal.

### Protected Physical Key Entry Methods for Untrusted Environments
- **The Secure Haptic Keypad**
  - **Problem**: Observation Attack
  - **Motivations**
    - Authentication in public spaces is common (ATMs, entry door systems, quick flight check-in kiosks).
    - Stolen PINs pose a significant risk to many systems (U.S. estimated yearly bank fraud amount $60M).
  - **Related Work**
    - Visual Obfuscation
    - Eye Tracking
    - Personal Interfaces
    - Haptic Obfuscation
  - **Haptic Password**
    - A sequence of tactile cues (tactons), inherently invisible to everyone.
    - Example: Haptic Password made of 3 tactons (1 Hz, 2 Hz, Continuous).

### System Overview
- **Haptic Keypad**
  - Constructed of three physically independent buttons, each capable of:
    - Sensing finger input
    - Rendering vibrotactile cues in the form of tactons
    - Accepting input selection
  - **Hardware**
    - Force sensing resistor (FSR) adjusts the strength of the vibrotactile output.
    - Linear coil vibrotactile actuators within the casing.
    - Physical switches for key selection.
  - **Software**
    - AVR micro-controller handles sensing, rendering, and input.
    - Connected to a computer via serial port.
    - Minimal GUI represents only completion progress.

### Interaction Model
- **Rules**
  - 3 tactons assigned to 3 keys (1-to-1 correspondence).
  - Tactons are randomized on keys after each entry.
  - Match input with password.
- **Example of Interaction**
  - Password to match
  - Press FSRs to "feel" the tactons
  - Select the tacton by clicking the key
  - Randomize tactons
  - Continue until done.

### Security Objective
- **Probability of Attack**
  - \( p(\text{brute-force attack}) = p(\text{observation attack}) \)
  - \( p(\text{attack}) = \frac{1}{\text{resilience to observation and brute-force attacks}} \)
  - Security Standard: 4-digit numerical password
  - \( p(\text{attack}) = \frac{1}{10000} \)

### Evaluation
- **Pilot Study**
  - Tacton recognition rates and times
  - 4 participants
  - Simplified version of the hardware
  - 15 practice trials + 60 test trials (20 of each cue)
- **User Study**
  - 3 experimental conditions (3 software prototypes)
  - 12 participants (mean age 29y)
  - Fully balanced repeated measures
  - 10 trials x 12 subjects x 3 conditions = 360 PIN entries (2520 selection events)

### Results
- **Median Task Completion Time**
  - ANOVA and post-hoc pair-wise t-tests significant.
- **Authentication Time**
  - Median Authentication Time (s)
    - 6-pin: 3.7s per selection
    - 9-pin: 3.7s recognize -> select
- **Errors**
  - Mean number of errors per authentication session
  - ANOVA not significant (high variance)
- **NASA TLX**
  - ANOVA on overall workload (NASA TLX) significant involving the Hybrid condition.

### Discussion
- **Type**
  - Performance
  - Security
- **Comments**
  - 6 PIN: Fast Time / Low Error
  - 9 PIN: Fast Time / Low Error
  - Hybrid: Trade-off between complexity and performance

### Contributions
- Introducing the Haptic Password model
- Introducing one possible interface and method (Haptic Keypad) to use a Haptic Password
- Preliminary user tests suggest that Haptic Password is a better alternative to Haptic Obfuscation
- Unimodal
- Simple cognitive task such as recognition

### Audio and Haptic Shoulder-Surfing Resistant PIN Entry Methods for Mobile Devices
- **The Phone Lock**
  - Motivations
    - From fixed to mobile
    - Observation: The New Old threat
  - Objectives
    - Introduce a new PIN entry system for mobile devices resistant against observation.
    - Compare authentication performance of audio and haptic stimuli as PIN.
  - **System**
    - Make a PIN invisible using invisible cues and a new interaction method.
    - Sequence of audio cues (sound) or vibration patterns (haptics).
