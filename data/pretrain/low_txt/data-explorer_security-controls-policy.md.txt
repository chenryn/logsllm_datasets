# Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance Controls for Azure Data Explorer

[Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/regulatory-compliance) provides Microsoft-created and managed initiative definitions, known as _built-ins_, for **compliance domains** and **security controls** related to various compliance standards. This page lists the **compliance domains** and **security controls** specific to Azure Data Explorer. You can assign these built-ins individually to help ensure that your Azure resources comply with the relevant standards.

Each built-in policy definition is linked to its corresponding entry in the Azure portal. Additionally, the **Policy Version** column provides links to the source code on the [Azure Policy GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy).

For more information on compliance for your business or organization, refer to the [Azure compliance documentation](/azure/compliance).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each control listed below is associated with one or more [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) definitions. These policies can help you [assess compliance](/azure/governance/policy/how-to/get-compliance-data) with the control; however, there may not be a one-to-one or complete match between a control and the policies. Therefore, "Compliant" in Azure Policy refers only to the policies themselves and does not guarantee full compliance with all requirements of a control. Additionally, some compliance standards include controls that are not currently addressed by any Azure Policy definitions. Thus, compliance in Azure Policy provides only a partial view of your overall compliance status. The associations between controls and Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance definitions may change over time.

## CMMC Level 3
