# Enable Disk Encryption for Your Cluster in Azure Data Explorer

To enhance the security of your cluster, you can enable disk encryption. This feature ensures that your data is protected at rest. The disk encryption is implemented using either [Azure Disk Encryption](/azure/security/azure-security-disk-encryption-overview) or [encryption at host](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-host-based-encryption-portal), depending on the SKU of your cluster. The data is encrypted at rest using Microsoft-managed keys.

> [!NOTE]
> - Enabling disk encryption can take up to 20 minutes, during which the cluster will be unavailable.
> - Legacy virtual machine (VM) sizes, such as the Dv2 family, are not supported. For more information, see [Finding supported VM sizes](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/disks-enable-host-based-encryption-powershell).

## Steps to Enable Disk Encryption

1. **Navigate to the Security Settings:**
   - In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Data Explorer cluster resource.
   - Under the **Settings** heading, select **Security**.

2. **Enable Disk Encryption:**
   - In the **Security** window, set the **Disk encryption** security setting to **On**.
   - Select **Save** to apply the changes.

> [!NOTE]
> To disable the encryption after it has been enabled, select **Off** and save the changes.

## Considerations

When using Azure Disk Encryption, consider the following:

- **Performance Impact:** There may be a performance impact of up to a single digit.
- **Sandbox Compatibility:** Azure Disk Encryption cannot be used with sandboxes.
