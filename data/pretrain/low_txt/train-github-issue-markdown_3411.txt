### Issue Description

During my testing, I observed that `PopupMenuItem` elements become misplaced when they are placed inside a `ReorderableListView` and triggered via a `PopupMenuButton`. The issue is particularly noticeable when the `PopupMenuItem` is nested within a `ListTile` inside a `ReorderableListView`.

### Sample Code
To reproduce this issue, you can use the following sample code. This code places items inside both a `ListView` and a `ReorderableListView`, allowing you to toggle between them and observe the different behaviors.

### Screenshots
For clarity, I have included screenshots of the test results:
