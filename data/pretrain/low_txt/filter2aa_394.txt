**Note:** You cannot control an elevator through the phone.

## Who Am I Not?
- I am not a lawyer, and I do not condone illegal activities. Always ensure you have permission before testing or hacking any systems.

## Recommended Reading

## Legal Disclaimer
- **Do Not Hack Systems You Do Not Own.**
- **All Recordings Were Conducted with Proper Consent.**
- **Do Not Interfere with Emergency Communications.**

**Please do not attempt these techniques in real-world scenarios without proper authorization.**

## Elevator Phone Systems Basics
### Types of Phone Systems
- **POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service)**
  - Most common in elevators.
  - Dials out when the handset is lifted or a button is pressed.
- **VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol)**
- **Cellular Networks**

### Key Regulations
- **ADA/ASME A17 Standards**
  - Mandate changes and compliance in elevator phone systems.
  - Building codes must be followed.

## History
- **Elevator Phones Introduced in 1968**
- **Rotary Phones Still in Use**
- **Ring Down System**
- **Mandatory in All Elevators by 1976**

## Information Gathering
### OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)
- **Who the Phone Dials To**
- **Building Information**
- **Phone System Information**
- **Phone Number Information (e.g., OpenCNAM)**

### Social Engineering
- **Pretend to Be an Elevator Technician**
- **Gather Target Information Remotely by SEing the Business and Call Centers**

### Physical Reconnaissance
- **Controlling Elevators with Independent Service Mode**
- **Identifying Key Locations and Components**

## Tools
- **Cell Phone**
- **Multi-Tool**
- **Landline Phone**
- **Linesman Handset**
- **9-Volt Battery (Sometimes AA)**

## Important Points
- **Site ID 2**
- **Hang Up Sequences: *#, #, *0, 0, or Press the Button Again**
- **PBX (Private Branch Exchange) and Line Concentrators**

### PBX
- **Private Branch Exchange**
- **Elevators Can Have Their Own PBX**
- **Older PBXs Operate on Low Voltage (24 Volts)**

### Line Concentrator
- **Outbound Calls: One at a Time, Others Get Busy Signal**
- **Inbound Calls: Double Beep, Enter “1”, “2”, or “3” Within 4 Seconds**
- **Power Failures: Potential for Misuse**

## Intercom Systems
- **Operated from Outside the Elevator**
- **Located in Hallways, Hostways, or Machine Rooms**
- **Video Demonstration Available**

## Fire Fighters Phone
- **System Detects Opens, Shorts, or Ground Faults**
- **Class A and Class B Wiring**
- **Alerts Fire Command Center Until Answered**

## Line Detection
- **Checking the Phone Line**
- **Key Resets Device for 24 Hours**
- **Key Controls Volume**
- **RTFM (Read the Fine Manual)**

## Programming
### Four Ways to Program
- **Keypad**
- **Switches**
- **Remote**
- **Programming Cable**

### Default Passwords
- **123456 GAL**
- **123456 Lincoln**
- **845464 (V-I-K-I-N-G)**
- **123456 Viking Access Password**
- **1234 K-Tech**
- **35842 T.R.E. Communications**
- ***3*12345678* Master Access Code (Talkaphone)**
- ***4** Guard Access (Talkaphone)**

### Harder Passwords
- **Common PINs: 1234 and 123456**
- **Chances of Guessing Correctly:**
  - **4-Digit PIN: 26.83% (Drops to 16.12% if 1234 Doesn’t Work)**
  - **6-Digit PIN: 20.21% (Drops to 8.53% if 123456 Doesn’t Work)**

### Options
- **Phone Number**
- **Connection Time**
- **Tone or Pulse**
- **Mute Dialing**
- **Auto Talk on Ring**

## Attacks
### Denial of Service
- **Line No Longer Functions**
- **Phone Calls Incorrect Number**
- **Bypassing Line Detection**

### Covert Listening
- **Turning the Elevator into a Covert Listening Device**
- **LED Problems**
- **Connection Time Issues**
- **Noise When Picking Up**

### Data Exfiltration
- **Using an Open Telephone Line to Exfiltrate Data**
- **Registering the Line to a Service Like Google Voice**
- **Dialing Specific Numbers**

### Financial Implications
- **Example: 60 Elevators at Brown University**
  - **Each Elevator Has Its Own Line**
  - **Monthly Cost Calculation: $6,609,600**

## Security Measures
- **Monitoring (Why Are We Having an Hour-Long Call?)**
- **Logging (Why Do 30 People Call the Elevator a Day?)**
- **Alerting (Is There Really an Emergency?... We Should Deal with That)**

## Recommendations for Manufacturers
- **No Default Passwords**
- **Disallow Common Top 20 PINs**
- **Prevent Remote Programming**
- **Train Call Centers for Social Engineering Attacks**
