### Title: Discovering New Bluetooth Low Energy Exploits Through Reverse Engineering of Multiple Vendors' Firmware

**Abstract:**

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has gained widespread adoption and renewed interest from the security community, which had previously focused more on Classic Bluetooth (BT). Protocols that operate "above" the Host Controller Interface (HCI) in the BLE stack are typically managed by full operating systems or applications. Vulnerabilities at these higher layers are well-documented and relatively well-understood; for example, there were approximately 70 such vulnerabilities in Android in 2019.

However, for performance and abstraction reasons, protocols below the HCI layer are handled by firmware running on microprocessors specifically designed for BLE support. Until recently, only one publicly disclosed remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability existed below the HCI layer: CVE-2018-16986, known as Armis' BleedingBit.

In this talk, I will share my journey from having no prior knowledge of Bluetooth to reverse engineering the firmware of multiple vendors. I will detail the process of discovering and exploiting new RCE vulnerabilities at the lowest levels of the BLE protocol stack. These exploits are particularly significant because they do not require pairing or authentication—only proximity—to be effective. I will also demonstrate these vulnerabilities during the presentation.
