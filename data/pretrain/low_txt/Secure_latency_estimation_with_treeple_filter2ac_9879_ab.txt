### Vantage Point Selection and Evaluation

Among the 250 possible choices, we selected the first vantage point \( T_1 \) to minimize the median relative error for the set \( S \). We then chose the second best vantage point \( T_2 \) such that, when combined with \( T_1 \), it would produce the lowest median relative error. This process was repeated until \( k \) vantage points were chosen.

### Baseline: Vivaldi

Vivaldi [7] is a well-known network coordinate system. The Vuze file-sharing application [25] implements a similar network coordinate scheme, and Vivaldi is used in various "secure" coordinate systems [12, 23, 27]. Using the iPlane dataset, we ran a simulation of Vivaldi, which resulted in a median relative error of 25%.

### Accuracy Analysis

Figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the relative error for varying numbers of vantage points \( k \). We observed that using fewer than 5 vantage points produced the same CDF curve. Increasing \( k \) from 5 to 10 improved accuracy, as the median relative error decreased. Further increasing \( k \) beyond 10 did not change the median relative error but provided gains in accuracy at the 90th percentile. Our scheme achieved a median relative error of 26%, slightly higher than Vivaldi's 25%. From the figure, it is evident that only 20 trusted vantage points are needed to accurately estimate the network distance between two nodes.

### Stability Analysis

If end-hosts in Treeple need to frequently contact the vantage points to obtain new positions, these nodes become a central point of failure, as they must be online all the time. To evaluate the stability of Treeple's positions over time, we used the best 20 trusted nodes from December 1, 2009, to estimate network distances for nodes from December 1, 2009, to December 21, 2009 (a three-week period). The median and 90th percentile relative errors are shown in Figure 4, indicating that Treeple remains accurate over time. Thus, frequent network measurements are not necessary, as the same positions can be used weeks later.

### Future Work

There are several potential improvements to Treeple that could enhance its accuracy. It is known that multiple interfaces, load balancers, multi-protocol label switching, and non-responsive hosts can affect the accuracy of network paths returned by traceroute. Resolving these issues could improve Treeple's accuracy. Additionally, we treated the trusted vantage points as fixed, but it is possible to have them migrate using standard methods such as migrating trusted servers for services like DNS, DHTs, and Tor. Finally, we plan to consider router compromise and expand our threat model to determine if Treeple remains provably secure, even if BGPSec is deployed.
