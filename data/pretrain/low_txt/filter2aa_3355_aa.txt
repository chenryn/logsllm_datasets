**Foreword**

The Office of the Assistant Attorney General, Office of Justice Programs (OJP), is providing funds through the Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) State Domestic Preparedness Equipment Program to purchase specialized equipment. This equipment enhances the capabilities of state and local government units to respond to acts of terrorism involving chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive devices.

This handbook is a result of a focused effort by the ODP to address interoperability and enhance communications among multiple agencies during large-scale terrorism incidents or emergencies. The ODP provided over 50 ACU/TRP-1000 systems to approximately 10 jurisdictions across the United States under a pilot grant project. The communities cited in the handbook were selected from those provided with the ACU/TRP-1000 systems as part of the ODP pilot grant project.

The ACU/TRP-1000 system is a valuable communication tool for establishing links with other local, state, and federal agencies at multi-agency response scenes. It provides radio interoperability during incidents requiring communication between diverse organizations using different radios and frequencies.

I look forward to building on the strong relationships developed during the first year of this important program. Through our combined efforts, state and local emergency response agencies will receive the funding and assistance needed to enhance their capabilities and prepare for events that we hope will never occur.

Sincerely,
Andrew T. Mitchell
Acting Director
Office for Domestic Preparedness

### 1. Introduction to ACU-1000/TRP-1000 Handbook

#### 1.1 Preface
This handbook provides practical information and steps for setting up and operating a multi-agency interoperability communications system using the ACU-1000 Modular Interface/Interconnect System and the TRP-1000 Transportable Radio Interconnect System.

#### 1.2 Grant Program Support
The National Institute of Justice, a bureau within the Office of Justice Programs, conducted research into the use of the JPS Communications, Inc., ACU/TRP-1000 systems in conjunction with the Multiple Agency Radio Interoperability System (MARIS) under the Advanced Generation Interoperability for Law Enforcement (AGILE) Program. Information from this program is available online at: [www.nij-agile.jhuapl.edu](http://www.nij-agile.jhuapl.edu).

#### 1.3 Preferred Technical Capabilities
Operators of the ACU/TRP-1000 should possess the following minimum requirements:
1. Experience with land mobile radio systems, including understanding of different frequency bands, modulation types, and trunking systems.
2. Knowledge of radio theory, such as receiver intermodulation interference.
3. Basic understanding of antenna theory, wave propagation, feed lines, and RF connectors.
4. Familiarity with all radios that may be interfaced with the system.
5. Ability to program various radios during an incident.
6. A technical degree or certificate is preferred but not required; amateur radio experience is a plus.
