### Overview
This presentation focuses on the vulnerabilities and defenses of sensor communication wires in alarm systems and access control. We will explore techniques for defeating line supervision and end-of-line resistors, as well as effective defense strategies.

### Key Topics
1. **Alarm Systems and Access Control**
2. **Defeating Line Supervision and End-of-Line Resistors**
   - Surrogate Resistor
   - Voltage Regulation
3. **Defenses**
4. **Practical Exercise**
   - Try it out in the Lock Bypass Village! [Link](https://www.bypassvillage.org/games/alarm_wire/)

## Alarm Zones
- **Zone 1**: Normally Closed (NC)
- **Zone 2**: Normally Closed (NC)
- **Zone 3**: Normally Open (NO)

### Attack Techniques
#### Binary Sensor Communication Lines - Normally Closed (NC)
- **Switch Open**: Controller sees high impedance → Alarm
- **Switch Closed**: Controller sees low impedance → No Alarm
- **Switch Open, Line Jumpered**: Controller sees low impedance → No Alarm

#### Binary Sensor Communication Lines - Normally Open (NO)
- **Switch Open**: Controller sees high impedance → No Alarm
- **Switch Closed**: Controller sees low impedance → Alarm
- **Switch Closed, Line Cut**: Controller sees high impedance → No Alarm

### Defense Strategies
- **Vulnerable**: Apply voltage across the line and listen for high or low impedance.
- **Less Vulnerable**: Apply voltage across the line and listen for impedance within a specific range.
- **Best**: Use encrypted digital lines with DOS detection heartbeats.

### End-of-Line Resistors (EOLR)
Two main approaches:
1. **Surrogate Resistor**
2. **Voltage Regulation**

#### Resistor Review
- **Resistance (R)**: \( R = \frac{V}{I} \)
- **Equivalent Resistance in Series**: \( R_{\text{equivalent}} = R_1 + R_2 \)
- **Equivalent Resistance in Parallel**: \( \frac{1}{R_{\text{equivalent}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \)

#### How Controllers Measure Resistance
- **Special Case: Open Circuit (Line Cut)**
- **Special Case: Short Circuit (Line Jumpered)**

### Example: Honeywell System
- **Voltage**: 12V
- **Normal State**: 5V
- **Alarm State**: 12V

### Attacking EOLRs
- **Schematic: Multimeter Adapter**
  - **V - SPDT**: Measure Voltage
  - **I - DPDT**: Measure Current
  - **Ω - SPDT**: Measure Component
  - **± - SPDT**: Apply Voltage for Zener
  - **★ - DPDT**: Engage Attack

### Improvements
- **Zener Diode Considerations**
  - **High Breakdown Voltage**: Avalanche effect dominates, not suitable for outdoor use.
  - **5.6V Breakdown**: Zener and Avalanche effects balance, temperature coefficients cancel.
  - **Low Breakdown Voltage**: Zener effect dominates, rounded knee at breakdown, less suitable.

### Schematic: Standalone Meter
- **1 - SPDT**: Measure Voltage
- **2 - DPDT**: Measure Current
- **3 - SPDT**: Measure Component
- **4 - SPDT**: Apply Voltage for Zener
- **5 - DPDT**: Engage Attack

### Defenses
- **Use Encrypted Digital Lines with DOS Detection Heartbeats**
