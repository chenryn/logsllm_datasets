## Abstract
Efficient and private searches over encrypted outsourced data are crucial for the growth of cloud-based services managing sensitive data, such as genomic, medical, and financial information. This paper addresses the challenge of constructing an efficient indexing data structure that enables secure and private substring search queries on outsourced document collections. Our solution integrates the efficiency of an index-based substring search algorithm with the secure execution features provided by Intel SGX and the access pattern indistinguishability guarantees offered by Oblivious RAM (ORAM). To mitigate information leakage from side-channel vulnerabilities in SGX, we redesign three ORAM algorithms and perform a comparative evaluation to identify the best engineering trade-offs for a privacy-preserving, index-based substring search protocol. The practicality of our solution is demonstrated by a response time of approximately 1 second to retrieve all positions of a protein in the 3 GB human genome string.

## Introduction
The rise of cloud computing has driven many organizations to offload both data and computation onto remote servers hosted by cloud service providers. Outsourcing data storage and computation to the cloud offers significant cost savings and high availability. However, the main challenge is ensuring the privacy of outsourced data, especially when the data are sensitive, such as biomedical or financial records. Encrypting outsourced data is only sufficient if the encryption allows computation over the encrypted data, but such solutions often incur prohibitive performance penalties.

Technical alternatives, such as Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX), have been developed to provide security guarantees at the hardware level. SGX creates trusted execution environments, known as secure enclaves, which ensure confidentiality and integrity for the code and data of applications running within them, even against the operating system or hypervisor. While SGX is robust from a cryptographic standpoint, it is vulnerable to microarchitectural side-channel attacks, which can reconstruct memory access patterns. To address this, we propose ensuring that the memory access patterns of an application running within an enclave are independent of the data being processed, a property known as obliviousness.

In this work, we design a privacy-preserving substring search protocol based on SGX and an inverted index (full-text index). The data owner builds a full-text index enabling the lookup of substring occurrences in a document collection. The data owner then outsources the full-text index and the document collection to an untrusted server. Given a query for a substring, the server computes the positions of the substring occurrences in each document. Our protocol, called Oblivious Substring Queries on Remote Enclave (ObSQRE), runs a substring search algorithm within an SGX enclave. The main challenges include designing a data-independent control flow to hide memory access patterns and efficiently combining the algorithm with a Doubly Oblivious RAM (DORAM) to retrieve entries from the full-text index.

### Contributions
- **ObSQRE Protocol**: We introduce ObSQRE, the first privacy-preserving substring search (PPSS) protocol using SGX enclaves, with two oblivious substring search algorithms based on the backward search method.
- **Security and Efficiency**: Our protocol is secure against malicious adversaries and achieves optimal bandwidth \(O(m + o_q)\), with a polylogarithmic computational cost \(O((m + o_q) \log^3(n))\).
- **DORAM Designs**: We propose a doubly oblivious version of Path ORAM, which improves upon state-of-the-art designs, and present the first doubly oblivious versions of Circuit and Ring ORAMs.
- **Experimental Evaluation**: We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of ObSQRE for real-world use cases, including genomic and financial datasets.

### Related Work
- **ZeroTrace**: Proposed the use of DORAM to hide access patterns to data structures but did not protect the memory access pattern to the code segment.
- **Obfuscuro**: Extended ZeroTrace to hide access patterns to code pages but introduced higher overhead compared to ObSQRE.
- **Substring Search Solutions**: Several solutions achieve bandwidth and computational costs dependent only on \(m\) and \(o_q\), requiring few communication rounds between the data owner and the server.

Our approach provides a practical and secure solution for privacy-preserving substring search in cloud-based environments.
