### Surveillance - Then and Now
- **1960s-1970s**: 
  - Radio receivers inside pipes
  - Microphones inside dragonflies
  - Cameras inside packs of cigarettes (Source: Business Insider)
- **Today**: 
  - Spyware/Remote Access Trojans (RATs)
  - Benign reasons for surveillance: Family, Couples, Friends

### Key Findings
- It is very easy to:
  - Enable premium features without paying
  - Access highly sensitive data of a person
  - Perform mass surveillance in real-time

### How Do Tracker Apps Work?
- **Observer**: Monitors the tracked person
- **Monitored Person**: The individual being tracked
- **Tracking Provider**: Back-end/cloud service that processes and stores data

### Data Types Collected
- Text messages
- Location data
- Call logs
- Other personal information

### Attack Vectors
- **Client-Side Authorization Bypass**:
  - Enabling premium features by modifying `SharedPreferences`
  - Example: Changing `removeAd` from `false` to `true` in `loveMonitoring.xml`
- **Admin Privileges**:
  - App supports two modes: parent (controller/administration) and children (monitored)
  - Administrators can create new administrators and monitor all children
- **Lockscreen Removal**:
  - Changing SharedPreference value from `true` to `false` to remove the lock screen
- **Authentication Bypass**:
  - Logging in without a password due to weak authentication mechanisms

### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
- **Data Interception**:
  - User/App communicates with the tracking provider
  - Attacker intercepts and modifies data in transit
- **Bad Cryptography and Obfuscation**:
  - Weak encryption and obfuscation techniques make it easier for attackers to decode and manipulate data
  - Example: Decoding and modifying HTTP requests to bypass login

### Recommendations
- **Do not use SharedPreferences for authorization checks**.
- Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Use robust encryption and secure communication protocols.
- Regularly audit and update security measures.

### Summary
- Tracker apps pose significant security risks due to weak implementation of authorization, authentication, and encryption.
- Users should be cautious and ensure they use apps from trusted sources and with strong security features.
- Developers must prioritize security to protect user data and privacy.
