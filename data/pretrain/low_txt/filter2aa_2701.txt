   - Understanding simple desktop/console vulnerabilities
   - Protecting information assets with layered defense
   - Subverting desktop security for fun and entertainment

**Audience Participation**
- At the end of this presentation, you will be asked to share:
  - Methods you use to secure your environment
  - Whether you follow defense-in-depth principles
  - What you would do differently

### Part 1: Help API Vulnerability

**What is a "Help API" Vulnerability?**
- A vulnerability that arises when an application running with system-level rights makes an API call to the help viewer without dropping privileges.
- This allows a user to exploit the help viewer to access other applications, which then execute at the system level.

**Bugtraq Report**
- **ID:** 8884
- **Date:** October 24, 2003
- **Reporter:** Brett Moore
- **Link:** [SecurityFocus](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/8884)

**Prevalence and Causes**
- **How Widespread?**
- **Why Do Vendors Continue?**
  - Cost considerations
  - Competitive pressure to release products quickly
  - Assumption that users won't abuse the product (security through obscurity)
  - Prioritizing sales over security, making customers pay for fixes

**Demonstration**
- **Netware Zenworks Remote Desktop Manager:** Novell released a security patch.
- **Spysweeper Anti-Spyware Enterprise Version:** Help API fixed, but the application still runs at system level.
- **McAfee AV 4.51:** Reported on September 15, 2004, Bugtraq #11181, with a different exploit point.

**Detection**
- **Identifying Vulnerable Systems:**
  - Check what is running with system rights (e.g., Task Manager).
  - Examine system tray icons.
  - Identify applications requiring higher rights to function (e.g., antivirus, anti-spyware, remote management tools, auditing tools).

**Protection**
- **Group Policy (maybe)**
- **Remove Icons from System Tray**
- **Test New Applications Before Deployment**

### Part 2: Subverting Windows Logon

**Project Overview**
- **This Yearâ€™s Research:**
  - Simple and portable
  - Easily protectable
- **Credit for the Research:**

**Bypassing Windows Logon**
- **Context:**
  - **Platforms:** XP, W2K3, etc.
  - **Motivation:** Curiosity and practical application
- **Methodology:**
  - **The Attack Process**
  - **The Attack Application**

**Exploit Details**
- **Part 1: Utility Manager**
  - **Description:** User-controlled utility running as Local System
- **Part 2: Logon Screen**
  - **Windows Stations and Desktops:**
    - `Winsta0`
    - Multiple desktops (Default, Screensaver, Winlogon)
- **Part 3: Delivery**
  - **Admin Access**
  - **API Vulnerabilities**
  - **Bit-Level Hard Disk Modification**
  - **Maintenance Boot Disk**

**Exploit Code**
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```c
  #include <windows.h>
  int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInst, HINSTANCE hPrevInst, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nShowCmd) {
      STARTUPINFO si;
      PROCESS_INFORMATION pi;
      memset(&si, 0, sizeof(si));
      memset(&pi, 0, sizeof(pi));
      si.cb = sizeof(STARTUPINFO);
      si.lpDesktop = "Winsta0\\Winlogon";
      CreateProcess("C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe", NULL, NULL, NULL, false, NULL, NULL, NULL, &si, &pi);
      return 0;
  }
  ```
- **Explanation:** This code sets the `CreateProcess` thread to run under the `winlogon` desktop, exploiting an architectural design issue in Microsoft.

**BOB RELOADED**
- **Installation:**
  - Use a maintenance disk to install the exploit code.
  - Open a backdoor at the `Winlogon` desktop using `osk.exe`.
- **Resources:**
  - Limited resources on XP (Task Manager, network access, memory tools).
  - On W2K3 server, run Explorer for full desktop access.

**Real-World Threat**
- **Impact:**
  - Potential security risks
  - Real-world scenarios
  - Similar exploits
- **Defense:**
  - Defense-in-Depth tactics to stop unknown exploits

**Basic Protection**
- **Group Policy (maybe)**
- **Remove or Disable `utilmgr`**
- **Disable Boot CD-ROM and Lock BIOS**
- **Host IDS on Servers**

**The Big Picture**
- **Employee Access:**
  - Policies
  - Separation of duties
  - Verification and testing before deployment
- **Non-Employee Access:**
  - Security awareness training
  - Contractual agreements with contractors and outsourcers
- **Defense in Depth:**
  - Combination of people, processes, and technology
  - Applied at each layer to ensure overall security

**Your Turn**
- **Share Your Methods:**
  - How do you secure your environment?
  - Do you follow defense-in-depth principles?
  - What would you do differently?
