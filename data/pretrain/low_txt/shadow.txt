### Shadow Command

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `shadow` command allows you to remotely control an active session of another user on a Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) server.

**Syntax:**
```shell
shadow <SessionName | SessionID> [/server:<ServerName>] [/v] [/?]
```

**Parameters:**

- **SessionName | SessionID:**
  - Specifies the name or ID of the session that you want to remotely control. Use the `query user` command to display the list of sessions and their session IDs.
  
- **/server:<ServerName>:**
  - Specifies the RDSH server containing the session that you want to remotely control. By default, the current RDSH server is used.
  
- **/v:**
  - Displays information about the actions being performed.
  
- **/? :**
  - Displays help at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**

- You can either view or actively control the session. If you choose to actively control a user's session, you will be able to input keyboard and mouse actions to the session.
- You can always remotely control your own sessions (except the current session), but you must have Full Control permission or Remote Control special access permission to remotely control another session.
- You can also initiate remote control by using the Remote Desktop Services Manager.
- Before monitoring begins, the server warns the user that the session is about to be remotely controlled, unless this warning is disabled. Your session might appear to be frozen for a few seconds while it waits for a response from the user.
- To configure remote control for users and sessions, use the Remote Desktop Services Configuration tool or the Remote Desktop Services extensions to Local Users and Groups and Active Directory Users and Computers.
- Your session must support the video resolution used in the session you are remotely controlling; otherwise, the operation will fail.
- The console session cannot remotely control another session, nor can it be remotely controlled by another session.
- To end remote control (shadowing), press `CTRL+*` (using the * key from the numeric keypad).

**Examples:**

- To shadow session 93, type:
  ```shell
  shadow 93
  ```

- To shadow the session named ACCTG01, type:
  ```shell
  shadow ACCTG01
  ```
