**Title: Black Hat Asia 2023 - Insider Threats: Employees Packing Corporate Data Before Departure**

**Abstract:**

What if your organization could identify employees who are exfiltrating data before they leave? According to the 2020 Securonix Insider Threat Report, 60% of insider threats involve "flight risk" employeesâ€”those planning to depart. While this issue is well-recognized, it remains challenging to address, particularly as cloud services become more prevalent and the distinction between personal and business traffic blurs.

In this presentation, we will discuss the indicators we have developed in a large-scale production environment to detect employees who are exfiltrating data prior to their departure. Our approach involved analyzing anonymized data from over 4 million users across more than 200 organizations worldwide. This data was collected from a subset of Netskope users with prior authorization.

Our analysis revealed that approximately 15% of departing employees used personal cloud applications to take corporate data with them. Based on these findings, we created models to identify insider threat flight risks and tested them over several months. These models successfully identified multiple insiders who were exfiltrating data, individuals who would otherwise have gone undetected.

We will present the behavioral insights we uncovered for employees preparing to leave, including the types and volumes of data they target, and the cloud providers they use. Our goal is to provide organizations with actionable indicators to better protect their sensitive information.
