This glossary provides terms and definitions for the IBM QRadar SIEM software and products. Cross-references are used as follows:
- **See**: Refers you from a non-preferred term to the preferred term or from an abbreviation to the spelled-out form.
- **See also**: Refers you to a related or contrasting term.

For additional terms and definitions, visit the IBM Terminology website.

#### A
- **Accumulator**: A register in which one operand of an operation can be stored and subsequently replaced by the result of that operation.
- **Active System**: In a high-availability (HA) cluster, the system that has all of its services running.
- **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**: A protocol that dynamically maps an IP address to a network adapter address in a local area network.
- **Administrative Share**: A network resource hidden from users without administrative privileges, providing administrators with access to all resources on a network system.
- **Anomaly**: A deviation from the expected behavior of the network.
- **Application Signature**: A unique set of characteristics derived from packet payload to identify a specific application.
- **ARP Redirect**: An ARP method for notifying the host if a problem exists on a network.
- **Autonomous System Number (ASN)**: In TCP/IP, a number assigned to an autonomous system by a central authority, enabling automated routing algorithms to distinguish autonomous systems.
- **Asset**: A manageable object deployed or intended to be deployed in an operational environment.

#### B
- **Behavior**: The observable effects of an operation or event, including its results.
- **Bonded Interface**: See link aggregation.
- **Burst**: A sudden sharp increase in the rate of incoming events or flows, exceeding the licensed flow or event rate limit.

#### C
- **CIDR**: See Classless Inter-Domain Routing.
- **Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)**: A method for adding class C Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, reducing the size of routing tables and making more IP addresses available within organizations.
- **Client**: A software program or computer that requests services from a server.
- **Cluster Virtual IP Address**: An IP address shared between the primary or secondary host and the HA cluster.
- **Coalescing Interval**: The interval at which events are bundled. Event bundling occurs in 10-second intervals, starting with the first event that does not match any currently coalescing events. Within the interval, the first three matching events are bundled and sent to the event processor.
- **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**: A scoring system measuring the severity of a vulnerability.
- **Console**: A display station from which an operator can control and observe the system operation.
- **Content Capture**: A process capturing a configurable amount of payload and storing the data in a flow log.
- **Credential**: A set of information granting a user or process certain access rights.
- **Credibility**: A numeric rating (0-10) determining the integrity of an event or offense. Credibility increases as multiple sources report the same event or offense.

#### D
- **Database Leaf Object**: A terminal object or node in a database hierarchy.
- **Datapoint**: A calculated value of a metric at a point in time.
- **Device Support Module (DSM)**: A configuration file parsing received events from multiple log sources and converting them to a standard taxonomy format for display.
- **DHCP**: See Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.
- **DNS**: See Domain Name System.
- **Domain Name System (DNS)**: The distributed database system mapping domain names to IP addresses.
- **DSM**: See Device Support Module.
- **Duplicate Flow**: Multiple instances of the same data transmission received from different flow sources.

#### E
- **Encryption**: In computer security, the process of transforming data into an unintelligible form, such that the original data cannot be obtained or can be obtained only through decryption.
- **Endpoint**: The address of an API or service in an environment. An API exposes an endpoint and invokes the endpoints of other services.
- **External Scanning Appliance**: A machine connected to the network to gather vulnerability information about assets.

#### F
- **False Positive**: An event or flow that the user decides should not create an offense, or an offense that the user determines is not a security incident.
- **Flow**: A single transmission of data passing over a link during a conversation.
- **Flow Log**: A collection of flow records.
- **Flow Sources**: The origin from which flow is captured. A flow source is classified as internal when flow comes from hardware installed on a managed host, or external when the flow is sent to a flow collector.
