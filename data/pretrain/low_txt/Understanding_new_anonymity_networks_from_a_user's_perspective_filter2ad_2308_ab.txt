### Covering the Public IP Address of Anonymity Network Exit Nodes

To study the exit node patterns, including frequency and rotation, we covered the public IP addresses of the anonymity network's exit nodes. We also leveraged these sites to measure web latency, as they have minimal content. To avoid placing unnecessary load on these IP reporting sites, our automated polls accessed each site only once every five minutes.

### Measuring Throughput

To measure the throughput of each anonymity system, we timed the download of a 403KB file from a well-connected university web server. This download was performed once every five minutes in hour-long sessions, distributed evenly throughout the day.

This approach allowed us to examine the latency, bandwidth, and exit node IP address diversity of each of the three anonymity systems: Tor, JAP (Java Anon Proxy), and SurfEasy.

### Results

#### Reliability
- **SurfEasy**: The experiments with SurfEasy were always completed successfully.
- **Tor**: Tor was generally reliable but had some intermittent issues.
- **JAP**: JAP was far less reliable, working properly on only about half of the PlanetLab nodes at any given time, with frequent failures for our testing nodes.

#### Network Performance
Table 1 shows the average latency results for each of the three anonymity systems across three IP address echo sites, excluding timeouts (60 seconds). These results are averages over all accesses of each site for each system. We attempted 240 connections over about 20 hour-long sessions for Tor and JAP. However, reliability issues with Tor and JAP caused some probes to be unsuccessful. The SurfEasy tests were the result of over 200 access attempts.

| System | my-ip-address.com (sec) | whatismyip.com (sec) | whatismyip.org (sec) |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Tor    | 16.803                  | 2.593                | 11.528               |
| JAP    | 9.371                   | 2.069                | 2.705                |
| SurfEasy | 3.674/9.321 (residential/institutional) | 0.525/0.937 (residential/institutional) | 2.328/2.743 (residential/institutional) |

SurfEasy had the lowest latency in most cases, while Tor had the highest. The low latency of SurfEasy suggests it is unlikely to implement a robust mixing architecture.

#### System Behavior
Table 2 shows the average number of unique IP addresses contacted by each system's client during connection setup and the total number of IP addresses contacted by the client while a connection was maintained and used over a period of one hour.

| System | Setup IPs | Total IPs | Exit Point Changes | Distinct Exit Points |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Tor    | 10.5      | 37.5      | 5.4                | 6.2                  |
| JAP    | 6.3       | 24.3      | 0.013              | 1.013                |
| SurfEasy | 2/3 (residential/institutional) | 2/3 (residential/institutional) | 0/0 (residential/institutional) | 1/1 (residential/institutional) |

Tor has a higher rotation of IPs than either JAP or SurfEasy. SurfEasy does not seem to rotate IPs and appears to use only a single proxy server in each anonymous connection. The reported IP address of the exit point is identical to the address contacted by the client.

### Confirming SurfEasy’s Single Proxy Architecture

To confirm our suspicions about SurfEasy’s single proxy architecture, we performed latency tests targeting the SurfEasy proxy from the source test node and a server we control. We then connected to the server we controlled from the test node. We obtained average ping round trip times of 30ms and 40ms from our university and residential test sites, respectively. When using the SurfEasy proxy to access one system from the other, we had a minimum round trip time of 149ms. Given the network latencies observed, this end-to-end latency leaves little room for more than a simple proxy server or mixed network under a single administrator’s control.

### Conclusion

Our experiments show that SurfEasy currently offers superior web browsing performance compared to Tor and Java Anon Proxy. It is also more reliable than either of the Tor or Java Anon Proxy systems. However, SurfEasy is still a new service and under development. It could only be tested from two locations in the same area and may behave differently in the future as the network expands.

While SurfEasy offers superior performance, the degree of anonymity it provides may be inferior to other modern approaches. Substantial evidence suggests that it uses only a single proxy, similar to the Anonymizer system. A single proxy server is vulnerable to attacks and allows the proxy server operator to easily break a user’s anonymity.
