### 4.2 Tagged-ACCE Security of TLS with SCSV/RIE

As noted at the beginning of this section, we cannot generically prove that if a TLS ciphersuite is ACCE-secure, then the tagged version of that ciphersuite is also tagged-ACCE- or tagged-ACCE-fin-secure. This is because we have made white-box modifications to the TLS protocol by introducing the SCSV/RIE countermeasure. Consequently, we cannot use its security results in a black-box manner. However, in most cases, a white-box approach, where the actual security proof is modified or extended, should be feasible and often straightforward. This was indeed the case when we examined the tagged TLS_DHE_DSS_.

**Theorem 1 (Informal):** Under the same assumptions on the cryptographic building blocks as in Jager et al. [16], TLS_DHE_DSS_ is a secure tagged-ACCE-fin protocol.

The formal theorem statement and proof are omitted due to space limitations and can be found in the full version [14]. The proof closely follows the proof by Jager et al. [16] that TLS_DHE_DSS_ is a secure ACCE protocol. Leaking the Finished messages does not affect security due to a game hop where, due to the pseudorandomness of the PRF, the Finished messages are replaced with uniformly random values independent of any information exchanged during the handshake. Including arbitrary extra data in the handshake messages does not impact security.

### 4.3 Multi-Phase Security of TLS with SCSV/RIE

We begin by showing that including the SCSV/RIE countermeasure does not weaken security: placing the Finished messages in the ClientHello and ServerHello does not introduce any vulnerabilities. In the next subsection, we will show how including the SCSV/RIE countermeasure yields a weakly secure renegotiable ACCE.

**Theorem 2:** Let \(\Pi\) be a generic tagged TLS ciphersuite as described in Section 4.2. Assume that \(\Pi\) is \((\tau, \epsilon_{\text{tagged}})\)-tagged-ACCE-fin-secure. Let \(\Pi'\) denote \(\Pi\) with SCSV/RIE countermeasures as described in Figure 2. For any adversary that \((\tau', \epsilon_{\text{mp}})\)-breaks the multi-phase ACCE security of \(\Pi'\) with \(\tau \approx \tau'\), it holds that \(\epsilon_{\text{mp}} \leq 2\epsilon'\), where \(\epsilon'\) is obtained from \(\epsilon\) by replacing all instances of \(n_{\text{pa}}\) in \(\epsilon\) with \(n_{\text{pa}} \cdot n_{\text{ke}}\) and replacing all instances of \(n_{\text{se}}\) in \(\epsilon\) with \(n_{\text{se}} \cdot n_{\text{ph}}\). (Recall that \(n_{\text{pa}}, n_{\text{se}}, n_{\text{ph}},\) and \(n_{\text{ke}}\) are the maximum number of parties, sessions per party, phases per session, and keypairs per party, respectively.)

Due to page limitations, we only provide the proof strategy here and refer to the anonymous full version [14] for the details.

**Proof Idea:** We will construct a multi-phase ACCE simulator \(S\) for \(\Pi'\) that uses a tagged-ACCE-fin challenger \(C\) for \(\Pi\). \(S\) will simulate every (party, public-key) pair and every (session, phase) pair with distinct parties and sessions in \(C\). For the most part, \(S\) will relay queries down to \(C\) and return the result. However, for queries related to renegotiation (Send, Decrypt), \(S\) carefully manages the handshake messages to transition one session in \(C\) to another.

**Remark 6:** A simulation similar to the one in the proof allows us to prove that TLS with SCSV/RIE countermeasures is a multi-phase ACCE protocol, even when different ciphersuites are used in different phases. The simulator interacts with a different tagged-ACCE-fin challenger for each ciphersuite; when a renegotiation inside one ciphersuite will result in a new ciphersuite, the simulator uses the Encrypt/Decrypt queries in the old ciphersuite to encrypt the Send messages from the handshake of the new ciphersuite. Unfortunately, for this multi-ciphersuite simulation to work, it is essential that public keys not be shared across ciphersuites: this technique could show that switching between an RSA-based ciphersuite and an ECDSA-based ciphersuite is safe. However, to analyze using the same RSA public key in two different ciphersuites, one would have to take an alternative approach, as it may not be possible to generically prove that re-using the same public key in two ACCE protocols is safe.

### 4.4 Weakly Secure Renegotiable ACCE of TLS with SCSV/RIE

We are now in a position to show that the use of the SCSV/RIE countermeasure in TLS results in a weakly secure renegotiable ACCE. We will do so generically, starting from the consequence of the previous theorem: that TLS with SCSV/RIE is a secure multi-phase ACCE.

**Theorem 3:** Let \(\Pi\) be a TLS ciphersuite with SCSV/RIE countermeasures, as described in Figure 2. If \(\Pi\) is a \((\tau, \epsilon_{\text{mp}})\)-secure multi-phase ACCE protocol, and PRF is a \((\tau, \epsilon_{\text{prf}})\)-secure pseudorandom function, then \(\Pi\) is a \((\tau, \epsilon)\)-weakly secure renegotiable ACCE, with \(\epsilon = \epsilon_{\text{mp}} + \epsilon_{\text{prf}}\).

The full proof of the theorem appears in Appendix A.

Intuitively, the use of the RIE countermeasure ensures that each party who renegotiates has the same view of (a) whether they are renegotiating, and (b) which handshake is the "previous" handshake. We can chain these together to obtain the property of a secure renegotiable ACCE: parties who renegotiate have the same view of all previous handshakes. If this is violated, either the non-renegotiable aspects of TLS have been broken, or a collision has been found in the computation of the renegotiation indication extension.

We can combine Theorems 2 and 3 to obtain the central results of the paper, justifying the security of the SCSV/RIE countermeasure:

**Corollary 1:** If a tagged TLS ciphersuite \(\Pi\) as described in Section 4.2 is a secure tagged-ACCE-fin protocol and PRF is a secure pseudorandom function, then that TLS ciphersuite \(\Pi\) with SCSV/RIE countermeasures as described in Figure 2 is a weakly secure renegotiable ACCE.

**Corollary 2:** Under the same assumptions as in Theorem 1, TLS_DHE_DSS_ with SCSV/RIE countermeasures is a weakly secure renegotiable ACCE protocol.

### 5. Renegotiation Security of TLS with a New Countermeasure

We now present a new TLS renegotiation countermeasure that provides integrity protection for the record layer transcript upon renegotiation (even when previous phases' session keys are leaked while the phase is still active), thereby achieving the full security of Definition 4. This countermeasure is quite straightforward: by including a hash of all record layer messages in the renegotiation information extension, parties can confirm that they share the same view of their previous record layers.

The renegotiation information extension already contains a fingerprint of the previous phase's handshake transcript via the client_verify_data (\(fin_C^{-1}\)) and server_verify_data (\(fin_S^{-1}\)) values. We modify the renegotiation information extension to include an additional value, the fingerprint of the encrypted messages sent over the previous phase's record layer. Specifically, if negotiating:
\[ ext_C \leftarrow fin_C^{-1} || H(RT_C^{-1}) \]
where \(RT_C^{-1}\) is the client's view of the previous phase's record layer transcript, and \(H\) is a collision-resistant hash function. The server uses \(RT_S^{-1}\) instead. Appropriate checks are performed by the server. With this additional information, the two parties will now not complete renegotiation unless they have matching views of the record layer transcripts from the previous phase.

In practice, it is not difficult to compute hashes of the ciphertexts sent and received over the record layer incrementally. It is not necessary to store all record layer messages to input to the hash function all at once, as common programming APIs for hash functions allow the hash value to be provided incrementally. However, the cost of the MAC computation can dominate the cryptographic cost of record layer computations [15]. The new countermeasure is only suitable for TLS communications over a reliable channel and cannot be used with DTLS communications over an unreliable channel.

Alternatively, if the sLHAE scheme for the record layer is implemented as encrypt-then-MAC or MAC-then-encrypt, it should be possible to use the MAC contained in the last encrypted message of the sLHAE scheme instead of the hash value computed above; this would result in no additional performance impact and would be easier to implement.

**Theorem 4:** Let \(\Pi\) be a TLS ciphersuite with the original RIE countermeasures as in Figure 2 but using \(ext_C\) as in equation (1). If \(\Pi\) is a \((\tau, \epsilon_{\text{mp}})\)-secure multi-phase ACCE protocol, \(H\) is a \((\tau, \epsilon_{\text{h}})\)-collision-resistant hash function, and PRF is a \((\tau, \epsilon_{\text{prf}})\)-secure pseudorandom function, then \(\Pi\) is a \((\tau, \epsilon)\)-secure renegotiable ACCE, where \(\epsilon = \epsilon_{\text{mp}} + \epsilon_{\text{h}} + \epsilon_{\text{prf}}\).

The proof proceeds similarly to that of Theorem 3. The main difference is that, in one case, the removal of restrictions A6 and A7 means we can no longer reduce down to a violation of confidentiality/integrity in the multi-phase security of \(\Pi\), and instead have to rely on the new countermeasure to detect non-matching record layer transcripts and reduce to the security of the PRF and hash function.

We refer to the full version [14] for the full proof.

### 6. Conclusion

Although two-party protocols for establishing secure communication have been extensively studied in the literature and are widely used in practice, this is the first work to consider the important practical issue of renegotiation, in which parties update one or more aspects of their connection—authentication credentials, cryptographic parameters, or simply refresh their session key. The importance of correctly implementing renegotiation was highlighted by the 2009 attack of Ray and Dispensa on how certain applications process data from renegotiable TLS connections.

We have developed a formal model for describing the security of renegotiable cryptographic protocols, focusing on authenticated and confidential channel establishment (ACCE) protocols. We have specifically analyzed renegotiation in the TLS protocol, identifying the original attack of Ray and Dispensa in our model. We have provided a generic proof that the SCSV/RIE countermeasure offers good protection against renegotiation attacks and have introduced a new countermeasure that provides renegotiation security even in the face of slightly stronger adversaries. In practice, the SCSV/RIE countermeasure may be sufficient.

Renegotiation, reauthentication, and rekeying are important features of many other applied cryptographic protocols. Future applied work includes examining the security of rekeying in protocols such as SSH or IKEv2 in our model. Open theoretical questions include how to adapt our approach for defining secure renegotiation to other primitives, particularly authenticated key exchange protocols. The overall security of TLS still has many important open questions, including the security of other TLS ciphersuites and the formal analysis of other complex functionality such as alerts and error messages. TLS session resumption [9, §F.1.4] is another important functionality of TLS, and it appears that our multi-phase ACCE model may be the right model in which to analyze its security, another interesting open problem. Given that attacks continue to be found outside the core key agreement component of TLS, further research into modeling the security of TLS in increasingly realistic scenarios is well-motivated.
