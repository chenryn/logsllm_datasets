## Abstract

As the number of computer-controlled systems connected to the Internet continues to grow, a vast amount of data is generated from their interactions with each other and with users. This continuous stream of data, known as Big Data, presents both opportunities and challenges for computer security and privacy. While Big Data can enhance security through advanced tools and techniques for processing security-event streams, it also makes it more difficult to detect attacks within the massive volume of event data.

The BADGERS'12 workshop aims to address these challenges by providing a forum for discussing the potential solutions for leveraging Big Data to improve computer security and privacy. Building on the success of the first BADGERS workshop, held in conjunction with the EuroSys 2011 conference in Salzburg, Austria, this year's workshop will continue to explore the intersection of Big Data and security.

## 1. Overview

While the systems community has long been collecting and analyzing large-scale, real-world data, security researchers have only recently begun to do so. Initiatives such as the European WOMBAT [2] and the US PREDICT [1] have started to gather and analyze security-relevant data. However, concerns over confidentiality, privacy, and liability often limit the scientific impact of such efforts, as data owners frequently require non-disclosure agreements.

There is an increasing need to expand the scope of data-driven security analysis and develop Internet-scale algorithms, techniques, and tools for analyzing and protecting the privacy of computer interactions. As attackers become more adept at leveraging the entire Internet, understanding their methods and motivations requires access to large, real-world datasets and the ability to mine them for relevant security information.

The BADGERS workshop aims to bridge the gap between computer security and large-scale data processing. It brings together researchers, practitioners, system administrators, and programmers to share knowledge and promote the sharing of data. The growing availability of tools and techniques for processing Big Data will undoubtedly benefit computer security.

## 2. Topics

The BADGERS workshop focuses on initiatives for Internet-scale security-related data collection and analysis. It provides a platform for describing existing large-scale datasets and sharing experiences gained from analyzing such data. The workshop also welcomes novel approaches to data collection and analysis. Key topics include:

- Scalable data collection from networks, hosts, or applications
- Real-time gathering and aggregation of diverse raw data
- Summarization of raw data for security goals
- Attack-resilient data collection
- Characterization of dataset external validity
- Scalability of security analysis with data volume
- Scalability of security analysis with concurrent-attack volume
- Combined historical and real-time security analysis
- Evaluating result accuracy for large datasets
- Real-time, incremental anonymization for data sharing
- Successful, failed, and novel models of data sharing
- Sharing of analysis results and supporting data
- Internet-scale sharing of security knowledge
- Legal issues around data collection and sharing

The workshop also encourages forward-looking, cutting-edge proposals, even if they are not fully implemented or evaluated.

## 3. Program

The BADGERS workshop accepts two types of submissions: regular papers and work-in-progress papers. Regular papers should not exceed 8 pages, excluding well-marked appendices, while work-in-progress papers should not exceed 2 pages, both in the ACM publication format.

The program includes four invited talks and four technical papers. The invited talks feature speakers from US government organizations and private companies, offering a diverse range of perspectives on the importance of Big Data for security and privacy. The technical papers cover a wide range of topics, including global intrusion analysis, Internet-scale darknets, privacy in location-based social networks, and vulnerability scoring systems. Together, the invited talks and technical papers provide a foundation for insightful discussions on the role and scope of Big Data in computer security research.
