**Question:**
In Windows 10, which of the following security features would provide the best protection against a malicious application attempting to tamper with the memory space of a trusted application, and what is a potential drawback of this security measure?

**Options:**
- **A:** SMB signing and mutual authentication for SYSVOL and NETLOGON shares – This may prevent legitimate scripts from processing domain-based Group Policy if misconfigured.
- **B:** Universal Windows apps running in an AppContainer sandbox – This may limit the app's functionality due to restricted system-level access.
- **C:** Protected Processes feature – This may interfere with system performance due to the additional validation required.
- **D:** Heap allocation randomization – This may cause compatibility issues with legacy applications that expect static memory allocation.

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
The Protected Processes feature in Windows 10 is designed to provide robust protection against malicious applications attempting to tamper with the memory space of trusted applications. However, this enhanced security comes with a potential drawback: the extra validation required can lead to a decrease in system performance.
