### The Importance of Enhanced Cybersecurity in SCADA Systems

The critical need for robust cybersecurity measures in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems is underscored by recent incidents in Ukraine. On December 23, 2015, an unauthorized third party gained access to the computer and SCADA systems of three regional electricity distribution companies in Ukraine. Investigations revealed that the breach was facilitated by a spear phishing attack, which led to the infection of the SCADA systems with the BlackEnergy malware. As a result, seven 110 kV and twenty-three 35 kV substations were disconnected, causing power outages that affected approximately 225,000 customers [19]. 

A year later, on December 17, 2016, another power outage occurred in Ukraine, this time affecting parts of the capital, Kiev, for over an hour. This incident was attributed to a more advanced form of malware known as "Industroyer" [23].

### Study of IoT Demand Attacks on Power Systems

This paper presents a comprehensive study of the impacts of Internet of Things (IoT) demand attacks on power systems, using cascading outage analysis in a North American Regional Interconnection System. Our simulation results indicate that a 1% load increase attack does not disrupt any generator, load, or transmission line in the system. Additionally, under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) protections prevent a 10% sudden IoT load increase from causing a cascading failure on the transmission lines.

#### Frequency Swing Attacks

A "frequency swing attack" is defined as a cycle of load increase and decrease attacks aimed at pushing the frequency outside the safety limits of the generators. However, our analysis shows that such attacks do not have the capability to cause an immediate disconnection of generators. We also explored the potential impact of repeated frequency swing attacks and the depletion of UFLS resources. The effectiveness of these attacks is influenced by additional frequency protection measures and the diminishing resources available to the adversary.

#### High-Impact Attacks

We also examined high-impact attacks involving control of 30% of the system load. Simulations revealed that a sudden 30% increase in system demand would lead to UFLS splitting the frequencies of the buses into islands of different operating regions. Conversely, a 30% decrease in load would cause the system frequency to rise above the thresholds for over-frequency protections, resulting in the disconnection of some, but not all, generators. Our findings suggest that the actions of UFLS and over-frequency protections are sufficient to prevent an immediate system failure over a short time after the attack. However, additional measures may be necessary over a longer timescale to restore stable operation. Importantly, our results indicate that a total system blackout is unlikely in this scenario. Furthermore, we found that including non-inertial generation in over-frequency protections could benefit the system during future IoT attacks targeting frequency disturbances.

### Conclusion

Our results provide a new perspective on the risks posed by IoT attacks to the power grid and can serve as a starting point for further discussions on assessing and mitigating this threat. While immediate cascading failures or total system blackouts are difficult to achieve, the power system will still suffer negative consequences. For instance, UFLS will disconnect various consumers from the grid to prevent further damage, affecting several users. Additionally, our simulations show that with millions of high-energy IoT devices, an attacker can potentially cause a bifurcation of the frequency, forcing the grid to operate as separate islands and driving it to a more vulnerable state.
