## Appendix A: Lessons Learned

Our proposal provides a fundamentally secure physical-layer building block for ToA measurement, which changes prevailing assumptions about the design of higher-level protocols. In [21], Clulow et al. proposed principles for distance bounding:

> "We propose several principles to adhere to when implementing distance-bounding systems. These include restricting the communication medium to speed-of-light channels, the communication format to single-bit exchanges for timing, symbol length to narrow (ultra-wideband) pulses, and protocols to error-tolerant versions. These restrictions increase the technical challenge of implementing secure distance bounding."

Given our design, these recommendations do not hold. The recommendation for single-bit timing is not only unnecessary but also wasteful. From [21]:

> "We show that the distance-bounding protocols proposed by Hu, Perrig, and Johnson (2003), Sastry, Shankar, and Wagner (2003), and Capkun and Hubaux (2005, 2006) are vulnerable to a guessing attack where the malicious prover preemptively transmits guessed values for a number of response bits."

In this work, we demonstrate that these vulnerabilities arise from a somewhat naively designed physical layer and modulation. They can be addressed purely at the physical layer. The problem and its solution are orthogonal to the design and security of the protocol, which operates at a different level of abstraction. If coupled with a physical layer that aligns with our design, these protocols are secure within the performance region we specify.

The empirical results are very similar, particularly in the MTAC region, which is not smaller than that derived from the Gaussian model.

The empirical results are very similar, particularly in the MTAC region, which is not smaller than that derived from the Gaussian model.

## Appendix B: Attacker Statistical Parameters

We choose the attacker's parameters to minimize the worst-case distortion, i.e.,

\[
(\hat{\mu}_{D_{\hat{A}}}, \hat{\sigma}_{D_{\hat{A}}}) = (\mu_{D_{\hat{A}}}(d_{\hat{A}, \text{ideal}}), \sigma_{D_{\hat{A}}}(d_{\hat{A}, \text{ideal}}))
\]

where

\[
d_{\hat{A}, \text{ideal}} = \arg \min_{d \in [0, d_{\max}]} \mu_{D_{\hat{A}}}(d) - \sigma_{D_{\hat{A}}}(d),
\]

and the parameters of the legitimate transmitter to maximize the distortion within the defined performance region, i.e.,

\[
(\hat{\mu}_{D_{\text{lgt}}}, \hat{\sigma}_{D_{\text{lgt}}}) = (\mu_{D_{\text{lgt}}}(d_{\text{lgt, worst}}), \sigma_{D_{\text{lgt}}}(d_{\text{lgt, worst}}))
\]

where

\[
d_{\text{lgt, worst}} = \arg \max_{d \in [0, d_{\max}]} \mu_{D_{\text{lgt}}}(d) + \sigma_{D_{\text{lgt}}}(d).
\]

## Appendix C: Validating the Gaussian Variance Model

We provide quantile-quantile (QQ) plots to compare the empirical distributions against normal distributions. This validates the model used in Section 7 to extrapolate the empirical classification performance to small likelihoods. We present these plots for a frame of 32 bits and a selection of communication distances, both for LoS and NLoS scenarios.

**Figure 17.** Results for the attacker's variance distribution. The relevant distance for the resulting MTAC region boundary is around 100m for LoS and around 10m for NLoS. There is a slight downward bend of the empirical value for higher quantiles, indicating slightly more high-variance outliers than the Gaussian hypothesis. The plots for these distances show that the empirical quantiles are well aligned with the straight diagonal.

**Figure 18.** Results for the attacker's distortion distribution. The relevant distance for the resulting MTAC boundary is around 200m for LoS and around 20m for NLoS. The plots for these distances show that the empirical quantiles are well aligned with the straight line at those distances relevant for the MTAC region derived in Section 7.

### Motivation for the Gaussian Model

We motivate the Gaussian model for the distortion distribution put forward in Equations 2 and 3.

## Appendix D: Effect of Frame Length

**Figure 19.** Security level for a particular distance as a function of the frame length. It is evident that bit-level equivalence of the security level is maintained as the frame length increases. The attacker's advantage decays faster than \(2^{-n_b}\).

### C.1. Extrapolation vs. Fully Empirical Results

We compare our extrapolated results from Section 7 to a fully empirical (i.e., Monte-Carlo) simulation. The probability of winning as a function of the performance level is shown in Figure 15 for LoS conditions and Figure 16 for NLoS conditions. Both results refer to a frame of 20 bits. For both scenarios, the attacker's advantage evolves almost identically. The fully empirical results indicate a slightly wider MTAC region, suggesting that our Gaussian model is a conservative estimate.

### C.2. Variance Distribution is Sufficiently Gaussian

We provide QQ plots comparing the empirical distributions against normal distributions. This validates the model used in Section 7 to extrapolate the empirical classification performance to small likelihoods.
