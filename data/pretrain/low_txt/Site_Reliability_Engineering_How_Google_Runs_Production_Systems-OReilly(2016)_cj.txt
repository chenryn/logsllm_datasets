### Colophon

The animal on the cover of "Site Reliability Engineering" is the ornate monitor lizard, a reptile native to West and Middle Africa. Until 1997, it was considered a subspecies of the Nile monitor lizard (Varanus niloticus), but is now classified as a polymorph of both Varanus stellatus and Varanus niloticus due to its different skin patterns. It has a smaller range than the Nile monitor, preferring a habitat of lowland rainforest.

Ornate monitors are large lizards, capable of growing up to 6–7 feet long. They are more brightly colored than Nile monitors, with darker olive skin and fewer bands of bright yellow spots running from the shoulder to the tail. Like all monitor lizards, this animal has a muscular, stout body, sharp claws, and an elongated head. Their nostrils are placed high on their snout, allowing them to spend time in water. They are excellent swimmers and climbers, which enables them to sustain a diet of fish, frogs, eggs, insects, and small mammals.

Monitor lizards are often kept as pets, though they require a lot of care and are not suitable for beginners. They can be dangerous when they feel threatened (lashing their powerful tails, scratching, or biting), but it is possible to tame them somewhat with regular handling and by teaching them to associate their keeper’s presence with the delivery of food.

Many of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to the world. To learn more about how you can help, visit [this link](#).
