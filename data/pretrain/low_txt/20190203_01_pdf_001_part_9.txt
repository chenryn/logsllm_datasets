**Note:** From this point on, it is suggested that you record the values you enter on these screens as they will be needed during the publication and subscription server registration process.

Enter values for the following fields:
- **Admin User:** The xDB administrator user name to authenticate certain usage of the xDB Replication Server, such as registering a publication server or a subscription server running on this host. Any alphanumeric string may be entered for the admin user name. The default admin user name is `admin`.
- **Admin Password:** Password of your choice for the xDB administrator given in the Admin User field.

**Figure 3-18: xDB Admin User Information**

The admin user and the admin password (in encrypted form) are saved to the xDB Replication Configuration file named `/etc/edb-repl.conf` (or `XDB_HOME\etc\edb-repl.conf` on Windows hosts). Click the Next button.

### 3.2 Installing from the Command Line

This section provides directions for installing xDB Replication Server from the Linux or Windows command line console.

There are three main ways to perform a command-line installation:
1. **Text Mode:** Include the `--mode text` parameter when invoking the installer to perform an installation from the command line, during which you will be prompted for user input.
2. **Unattended Mode:** Include the `--mode unattended` parameter when invoking the installer to perform an installation without user input. In this case, required parameters must be specified on the command line when invoking the installer or the `--optionfile` parameter must be used to specify a file containing the parameter settings.
3. **Extract Only:** Invoke the installer with the `--extract-only` parameter to only extract the files when you do not hold the root privileges required to perform a complete installation.

The xDB Replication Server installer program can be downloaded directly from the EnterpriseDB website or by using Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus. The installer program name may vary depending on how you obtained it. The following are some examples illustrating command-line installation.

**Note:** For additional detailed information on how to install EnterpriseDB products from the command line, see the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide located at: [https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/product-documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/product-documentation)

**Note:** You must have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.7 or later installed on the hosts where you intend to install any xDB Replication Server component (xDB Replication Console, publication server, or subscription server). Any Java product such as Oracle Java or OpenJDK may be used. Follow the directions for your host operating system to install Java runtime.

**Note:** For Advanced Server versions prior to 9.3, a Java runtime is supplied and installed as part of the Advanced Server installation process. However, you must still have a separate Java runtime system pre-installed on your host. The xDB Replication Server installation process does not utilize the Java runtime supplied with Advanced Server.

**Example 1: Starting the xDB Replication Server Installation in Text Mode**

```sh
$ ./xdbreplicationserver-6.1.0-alpha-1-linux-x64.run --mode text
Language Selection
Please select the installation language
[1] English - English
...
Please choose an option [1]:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Postgres Plus xDB Replication Server Setup Wizard.
...
```

**Example 2: Starting the Installation in Unattended Mode with an Options File**

```sh
$ su root
Password:
$ ./xdbreplicationserver-6.1.0-alpha-1-linux-x64.run --optionfile /home/user/xdb_config
```

**Content of the options file, `xdb_config`:**

```ini
