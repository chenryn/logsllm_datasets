I recently launched a new Google Compute Engine instance running Windows Server 2008 R2, Service Pack 1. When I attempted to install Python 2.7.9 using the .msi installer, both the 64-bit and 32-bit versions failed with the following error message:

> "There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A program required for this install to complete could not be run. Contact your support personnel or package vendor."

Has anyone else encountered this issue or knows of a workaround?

**Response:**

It appears that the issue may be related to missing dependencies. Please try installing the "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x64)" before attempting to install Python again. This should resolve the dependency issue and allow the installation to proceed successfully.
