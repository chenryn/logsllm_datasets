**Title: Black Hat USA 2021 - Arm'd and Dangerous: Analyzing M1 Malware**

Apple's new M1 systems bring a multitude of benefits to macOS users, but they also present new opportunities for malware authors. In this talk, we will delve into the first malicious programs specifically compiled to natively target Apple Silicon (M1/arm64), with a focus on effective analysis methods.

We will begin by covering foundational topics, such as techniques for identifying native M1 code, which will be invaluable when hunting for M1 malware. We will also introduce key concepts in arm64 reverse engineering. With a curated collection of malware samples that are natively compiled for M1 (and in some cases, even notarized by Apple), we will demonstrate a range of analysis techniques, including those specific to arm64 code on macOS.

By the end of the session, you will be equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to proficiently analyze macOS M1 malware.
