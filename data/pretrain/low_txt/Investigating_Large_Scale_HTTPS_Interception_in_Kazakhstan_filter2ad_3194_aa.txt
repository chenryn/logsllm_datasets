## Abstract
The widespread adoption of HTTPS has significantly enhanced web security, but this progress is at odds with governments seeking to monitor and control user communications. In 2019, the government of Kazakhstan conducted a large-scale HTTPS interception attack by compelling users to trust a custom root certificate. Our research detected and monitored the scale and evolution of this attack using both in-country vantage points and remote measurement techniques. We found that the attack targeted 37 unique domains, primarily social media and communication services, suggesting a surveillance motive. The interception affected a significant portion of connections through the country’s largest ISP, Kazakhtelecom. Continuous real-time measurements indicated that the interception system was active for 21 days before being shut down. Subsequently, based on our findings, two major browsers (Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome) blocked the use of Kazakhstan’s custom root certificate. This incident sets a dangerous precedent for other countries that may seek to circumvent online encryption.

## 1. Introduction
HTTPS protects billions of users, with 74-95% of daily web traffic now encrypted, providing essential privacy and security [1, 23]. However, deep packet inspection technologies that can inspect HTTPS connections have also advanced [29, 46, 50]. While enterprise-level interception is common, it is fraught with security issues [17, 40]. Large-scale interception at the ISP or national level has been limited, even as increased HTTPS adoption challenges mass surveillance and keyword-based censorship [5, 19].

In 2019, Kazakhstan became the first country to deploy carrier-grade HTTPS interception on a national scale. Starting on July 17, 2019, the Republic of Kazakhstan launched an HTTPS man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, instructing citizens to install a government-issued root certificate for "security" purposes [8]. This interception, described as a "pilot," covered large portions of the country's network and was intermittently active until August 7, 2019.

During the attack, we worked to understand the interception technique, measure its scope, and identify its likely targets. We first detected the interception using Hyperquack, a recently introduced remote technique for detecting keyword-based network interference [50]. On July 20, Hyperquack's HTTPS measurements to 82 available vantage points in Kazakhstan detected rogue untrusted certificates for popular destinations such as google.com and facebook.com, issued by the Kazakh government's custom root CA, Qaznet Trust Network. We confirmed these detections with direct measurements from local virtual private servers (VPSes) and 52 in-country RIPE Atlas nodes.

We determined that the interception system triggered on TLS connections passing through certain network locations in Kazakhstan when a targeted domain was present in the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) header. This allowed us to probe the system using connections originating from outside or inside the country, destined for any HTTPS server in Kazakhstan. We performed comprehensive measurements from North America and two Kazakh VPSes to 6,736 TLS hosts, setting the SNI header to popular domains. We also conducted TTL-limited measurements to discover the location in the network where the interception was occurring. To track the attack over time, we performed continuous measurements until well after the interception system was shut down.

Our findings show that only a fraction of the Internet traffic inside the country was subject to interception (around 7-24% of the 6,736 TLS hosts measured were affected). The path to all of the servers affected by the interception passed through two sets of specific hops in AS9198 (Kazakhtelecom). Of the Alexa Top 10,000 domains [4], 37 triggered interception, primarily media and communication sites, including 20 Google services and 7 Facebook-affiliated services. The set of targets suggests that the government's actions were motivated by surveillance, rather than increased security as claimed. From our longitudinal measurements, we observed the interception being turned on and off intermittently, suggesting that the system was still being tested or tuned. The interception was officially shut down on August 7, with an announcement that it would be used again "when there is a threat" [38]. We have not detected it since.

Kazakhstan's national-level HTTPS interception sets a dangerous precedent, not only for Kazakhstan but for all governments and powerful actors seeking more control over users' Internet traffic. It also highlights the limitations of HTTPS. Although no one was forced to install the Qaznet root CA, most affected sites employed Strict Transport Security, so users who did not install the certificate were unable to access these sites, even by clicking through security warnings. During the period the interception system was active, the private data of many thousands of users could have been compromised, including credentials for some of the world's most popular sites, and the security of their connections was significantly reduced.

We hope our work will inform efforts within the HTTPS security ecosystem to plan responses to future incidents of national-level interception. Based on our findings, two major browser vendors, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, completely blocked the use of the Qaznet Trust Network root, preventing future use even if users manually trust the certificate [33]. We advocate similar reactions to future interception events and further research into technologies that can rapidly detect and impede such attacks.

### 1.1 Ethics
Our measurements were guided by several ethical considerations. First, we avoided directly involving any human subjects in Kazakhstan due to potential legal risks. For direct measurements using RIPE Atlas probes and VPSes in the country, we only ran preliminary tests to google.com and facebook.com, two very popular domains unlikely to draw suspicion, and did not conduct any longitudinal measurements that might overload the network.

Ethical practices for remote censorship measurement have been extensively discussed in the literature [13, 25, 36, 42, 56, 57]. Since IRBs have determined that our study is outside their purview, we followed community norms and the guidelines listed in the Menlo and Belmont reports [15, 37]. Specifically, our primary remote measurements to TLS hosts in Kazakhstan only used hosts with valid certificates to exclude typical residential hosts. We tested only domains from the Alexa Top 10,000 [4] to reduce any risk of retaliation based on visiting unusual sensitive sites. For a separate experiment testing sensitive domains from the Citizen Lab Test List [12], we limited our vantage points to servers presenting a valid EV certificate, as these are almost exclusively larger organizations.

Additionally, we followed the Internet-wide scanning best practices proposed by the ZMap Project [18]. All our measurement machines have WHOIS records and a web page served from port 80, indicating that measurements are part of a research project and offering the option to opt-out. We did not receive any complaints during the study period.

## 2. Background
In this section, we provide background on HTTPS interception attacks, their prevalence, and efforts to detect and prevent them, followed by a brief timeline of the events in Kazakhstan leading up to the large-scale interception attack.

### 2.1 Related Work: HTTPS Interception
To perform HTTPS interception, a network entity poses as the destination server, accepting HTTP requests from clients and transparently proxying them to the real site [9]. HTTPS is designed to prevent this by requiring the server to present a certificate signed by a certificate authority (CA) the client trusts, associating its public key with the requested domain. For interception to succeed, either the attacker must cause a browser-trusted CA to falsely issue a certificate for the target domain, or the user must install and trust a custom CA, which the interception system can use to sign certificates the client will accept for any site. The latter approach is commonly used in residential and enterprise settings by client-side software and middleboxes for malware protection and content filtering [29, 46].

However, previous work has shown that interception frequently decreases connection security due to implementation flaws and lack of support for recent standards [17, 40, 53]. Moreover, such technology provides efficient avenues for implementing censorship and surveillance [10, 22, 44, 50], as the proxy can observe or modify connection plaintext.

In contrast to the prevalence of interception within enterprises, large-scale adversarial HTTPS interception has rarely been documented, and the few recorded instances have tended to be brief and narrowly focused. The best-known incident occurred in 2011, when an attacker compromised a CA called DigiNotar and created a fake browser-trusted certificate for *.google.com, which an ISP in Iran used to intercept connections to Google services [5]. Large-scale interception attacks were also detected in Syria (for facebook.com) and China (for github.com) for short periods in 2011 and 2013, respectively [19, 24], both based on untrusted certificates that raised security warnings in users' browsers. Kazakhstan's 2019 attack greatly exceeded these in duration, breadth of targets, and administrative sophistication. It also represents the first time a national government attempted to induce its citizens to install a custom CA for purposes of interception.

To defend against interception via CA compromise, researchers have proposed various mechanisms to complement or replace CAs [14, 30, 55] or to limit their scope of trust [26, 47], though none has seen wide adoption. The idea of certificate pinning, where a client remembers the public key or certificate of a previously visited site, has also been proposed to mitigate such attacks.

### 2.2 Timeline of Events in Kazakhstan
On July 17, 2019, the Kazakh government instructed citizens to install a custom root certificate, Qaznet Trust Network, for "security" purposes. An initial thread about the interception was started on Bugzilla (Mozilla's bug tracker forum) on July 18 [8], which served as the starting point for our investigations.

## 3. Triggering Interception
The first step in investigating the large-scale HTTPS interception employed by Kazakhstan was to explore methods to trigger and detect the interference. We designed our experiments to trigger and analyze the interception based on the ethical considerations described in §1.1.

### 3.1 Methodology
We employed both direct measurements from inside the country and remote measurements from outside the country. For performing direct measurements, we obtained access to two VPS clients and 52 RIPE Atlas probes in the country. The two VPS clients were located in AS203087 and AS208450. We performed direct HTTPS requests to google.com and facebook.com, two domains reported in the initial Bugzilla report about the interception [8], from both the VPSes and the RIPE Atlas probes on July 20, 2019.

To select infrastructural vantage points, we used data from Censys [16] to identify web servers that returned a valid EV certificate, as these likely belong to large organizations [49]. We identified 82 such vantage points in Kazakhstan, located in 21 ASes. On July 20, 2019, we performed Hyperquack HTTPS measurements to these 82 vantage points in Kazakhstan, with the input test list containing domains from the Citizen Lab Global Test List [12], a curated list of globally censored and sensitive domains, and Alexa Top 1000 popular domains [4], following the same test list selection process adopted in previous work [49, 50].

To increase the scale of measurements, we tested whether the interception could be triggered using remote measurement techniques from outside the country. Specifically, we used Hyperquack, a recently introduced remote measurement technique that detects network interference by sending various HTTP and HTTPS requests to thousands of infrastructural web servers around the world [50]. Hyperquack first requests several benign bogus domains in the form of .example.com from each web server. Since the web servers do not host these domains, they will likely respond with an error page. If the error response for all the requested domains is the same, Hyperquack uses this response to create a template that serves as the expected server response. This template includes features such as the response status code and the HTML body. In the case of HTTPS measurements, the template additionally includes the certificate, chosen TLS version, and cipher suite.

After building the template, Hyperquack requests test domains (potentially blocked domains) from each server. Since the web servers do not host these domains, the server response is expected to be the same as the template. However, if the response for the test domain differs, it indicates potential network interference.
