# Analysis of Network Performance and Overlay Schemes

## 1. Bandwidth and RTT Analysis

### 1.1 Mean Bandwidth over Time
**Figure 3: Mean Bandwidth Averaged Over All Receivers as a Function of Time**

- **Y-Axis:** Mean Bandwidth (in Mbps)
- **X-Axis:** Time (in seconds)
- **Data Points:**
  - 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0
- **Time Intervals:**
  - 0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200

The figure shows the mean bandwidth averaged over all receivers as a function of time. The data indicates a gradual decrease in bandwidth, followed by a recovery period after a set of topology changes, which is indicated by vertical lines. The system recovers to its original performance within approximately 40 seconds.

### 1.2 Mean Round-Trip Time (RTT) over Time
**Figure 4: Mean RTT Averaged Over All Receivers as a Function of Time**

- **Y-Axis:** Mean RTT (in ms)
- **X-Axis:** Time (in seconds)
- **Data Points:**
  - 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 50, 0
- **Time Intervals:**
  - 0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200

This figure illustrates the mean RTT averaged over all receivers as a function of time. The data shows that the RTT remains relatively stable over the duration of the session.

### 1.3 Cumulative Distribution of RTT
**Figure 5: Cumulative Distribution of RTT, One Curve for Each Receiver**

- **Y-Axis:** Fraction of RTT Estimates
- **X-Axis:** RTT (in ms)
- **Data Points:**
  - 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600

Each curve in this figure represents the cumulative distribution of RTT estimates for a particular receiver. The data indicates that over 94% of the RTT estimates are less than 200 ms, and over 98% are less than 400 ms. This suggests that end-to-end latencies are generally below 100 ms, and almost always below 200 ms.

## 2. Comparison of Overlay Schemes

### 2.1 Primary Set at 1.2 Mbps Source Rate
**Figure 6: Mean Bandwidth Versus Rank at 1.2 Mbps Source Rate for the Primary Set of Machines**

- **Y-Axis:** Mean Bandwidth (in Kbps)
- **X-Axis:** Rank
- **Schemes:**
  - Sequential Unicast
  - Bandwidth-Latency
  - Bandwidth-Only
  - Random

This figure compares the mean bandwidth received by machines of different ranks using four different overlay schemes. The data shows that Bandwidth-Latency and Bandwidth-Only perform comparably to Sequential Unicast, with the worst-performing machine receiving an average bandwidth of around 1150 Kbps. The Random scheme, however, performs sub-optimally, with the worst machine receiving only about 600 Kbps on average.

**Figure 7: Mean RTT Versus Rank at 1.2 Mbps Source Rate for the Primary Set of Machines**

- **Y-Axis:** Mean RTT (in ms)
- **X-Axis:** Rank
- **Schemes:**
  - Sequential Unicast
  - Bandwidth-Latency
  - Bandwidth-Only
  - Random

This figure compares the mean RTT for different ranks using the same overlay schemes. Bandwidth-Latency optimizes the overlay for delay, with the worst machine having an average RTT of about 160 ms. Both Random and Bandwidth-Only perform worse, with RTTs up to 350 ms and 250 ms, respectively.

### 2.2 Primary Set at 2.4 Mbps Source Rate
**Figure 8: Mean Bandwidth Versus Rank at 2.4 Mbps Source Rate for the Primary Set**

- **Y-Axis:** Mean Bandwidth (in Kbps)
- **X-Axis:** Rank
- **Schemes:**
  - Sequential Unicast
  - Bandwidth-Latency
  - Latency-Only
  - Prop-Delay-Only

At a higher source rate of 2.4 Mbps, the paths from the source to most receivers can sustain the required bandwidth, as indicated by the Sequential-Unicast test. Bandwidth-Latency comes very close to achieving this benchmark, outperforming other schemes for lower-ranked machines. Latency-Only and Prop-Delay-Only perform poorly in terms of bandwidth, with Bandwidth-Latency outperforming them by over 500 Kbps for machines of rank 1â€“5.

**Figure 9: Mean RTT Versus Rank at 2.4 Mbps Source Rate for the Primary Set**

- **Y-Axis:** Mean RTT (in ms)
- **X-Axis:** Rank
- **Schemes:**
  - Sequential Unicast
  - Bandwidth-Latency
  - Latency-Only
  - Prop-Delay-Only

This figure shows the mean RTT for different ranks at a 2.4 Mbps source rate. Bandwidth-Latency continues to optimize the overlay for delay, with the worst machine having an average RTT of about 160 ms. Both Latency-Only and Prop-Delay-Only perform worse, with RTTs up to 350 ms and 250 ms, respectively.

## 3. Conclusion

- **Bandwidth-Latency** and **Bandwidth-Only** schemes provide consistently good performance in terms of both bandwidth and RTT.
- The **Random** scheme is sub-optimal and results in high variability in performance.
- At higher source rates, **Latency-Only** and **Prop-Delay-Only** schemes struggle to maintain good bandwidth, while **Bandwidth-Latency** continues to perform well.

These findings highlight the importance of considering both bandwidth and latency in the construction of overlay networks, especially in heterogeneous environments.
