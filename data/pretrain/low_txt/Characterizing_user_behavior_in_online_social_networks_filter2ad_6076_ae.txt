### 4. How Users Arrive at Other People’s Pages

**Table 4: Preceding Locations and Activities for First Visits to Immediate and Non-Immediate Friends’ Pages**

| Activity | Percentage |
|----------|------------|
| Browse friends list | 15% |
| Browse scraps | 5% |
| (Other activities) | 80% |

**Note:** The percentages in the table represent the frequency of each activity preceding a first visit to a friend's page.

### 5.3 Number of Friends Interacted With

We investigated how silent interactions affect the level of user interactions along the social network topology. We compared the number of friends (including multi-hop friends) a user interacts with through all activities with the number interacted with through only visible activities, as a function of the number of friends in the social graph. Figure 9 illustrates these comparisons.

**Figure 9: Comparison of the Orkut Social Graph Degree and Interaction Degree**

Overall, the degree of interaction is very low. The average user interacted (whether visibly or silently) with 3.2 friends in total over the 12-day period and interacted visibly with only 0.2 friends. This low level of interaction has also been observed in other studies. According to Wilson et al. [33], nearly 60% of users in the Facebook social network exhibit no interaction at all over an entire year. Therefore, our 12-day workload trace is expected to show a much lower level of interaction.

Interestingly, even for a short trace period, the degree of all interactions is 16 times greater than the degree of visible interactions. This stark difference may be because the majority of OSN usage time is spent browsing, which cannot be captured by visible interactions. Another trend we observed is that the interaction degree does not grow rapidly with the user degree in the social graph; users with low degrees interacted with a similar number of friends as users with high degrees. This indicates that it is easier to form friend links than to actually interact with those friends.

In summary, our analysis of social interaction in this section revealed several interesting findings:
- When considering silent interactions like browsing friends’ pages, the measured interaction among users significantly increased.
- In total, 55% of users in the workload trace interacted with at least one other user during the 12-day period; 8% showed at least one visible interaction, and 47% showed only silent interactions.
- If one were to measure the strength of social ties based on visible traces, such analysis would be biased because 85% (=47/55) of the users would be completely disregarded.
- Considering silent interactions increased the number of friends a user interacts with by an order of magnitude over the 12-day period, compared to only considering visible interactions.

### 6. Discussion

Our measurement analysis provides many interesting findings that we believe will be useful in various ways. Below, we discuss the implications of these findings.

#### Modeling of OSN Sessions

In Section 3, we characterized the properties of individual session properties in OSN workloads. Among various findings, we highlight that session quantities like inter-session times, session lengths, and inter-request times follow a heavy-tailed distribution. For example, the majority of sessions remain short (on the order of tens of minutes), but some sessions last several hours to days. As a result of the asymmetry of the distribution, user behaviors cannot be represented as a normal distribution with comparable mean and variance. Also, the typical behavior of users will not be the same as their average behavior [15].

To incorporate the large variation in user behaviors, we provided statistics for the average behavior as well as the best-fit distribution functions that capture this asymmetry (Section 3.3). Such distribution functions can be used to generate synthetic (parameterizable) traces that mimic actual OSN workloads. We hope that the statistics summarized in the paper and the session modeling will be valuable in evaluating and testing potential OSN services.

#### Understanding User Activity in OSNs

In Section 4, we characterized the type, frequency, and sequence of user activities in OSNs. Using clickstream data, we presented a complete profile of user activity in Orkut in Table 2 and Figure 6. We also examined the differences and similarities in user activity across multiple OSN sites. Our analysis demonstrated that browsing, which cannot be identified from visible data, is the most dominant behavior (92%).

Understanding user activity is important for OSN service providers and portals [3, 33] as well as for advertising agencies [2]. This is because frequently repeated activities (e.g., browsing home, browsing scraps) naturally serve as good targets for advertisements, and the sequence of activities can be analyzed to improve the website design. One application of our analysis is that an OSN service provider may consider providing a personalized web interface for users based on their activity profiles. For example, a user login page can be reorganized so that frequently repeated activities are more easily accessible. OSN service providers may also use aggregate patterns in clickstreams to identify users with similar behaviors (e.g., belonging to the same communities, possessing similar profile descriptions) and recommend popular content within the site.

#### Interaction Over the Social Graph

In Section 5, we used both clickstream data and the social graph topology to study how users interact with friends in OSNs. Among various findings, we observed that Orkut users not only interact with 1-hop friends but also have substantial exposure to friends that are 2 or more hops away (22%). This exposure to friends’ pages has significant implications for information propagation in OSNs: OSNs exhibit "small-world" properties [1, 21, 33], which means that the network structure has the potential to spread information quickly and widely. Our observation highlighted that users actively visiting immediate and non-immediate friends’ pages serves as an empirical precondition for word-of-mouth-based information propagation.

Especially when it comes to rich media content like videos and photos, more than 80% of content was found through a 1-hop friend (Figure 7). This finding reinforces some of the recent studies that emphasize the impact of word-of-mouth-like information propagation through friends in social networks (the so-called social cascade) [4, 5, 28]. As OSN traffic is expected to grow rapidly [23], the patterns of social interaction and information flow can be valuable in designing the next-generation Internet infrastructure and content distribution systems [16, 26]. For instance, by tracking down the patterns of social cascades in OSNs and correlating them with information about the geographical locations of users, we can make an educated guess about the geographical regions to which particular pieces of content will likely spread. Such predictions will allow for the design of efficient content distribution systems.

### 7. Related Work

There is a rich set of studies on analyzing the workloads of Web 2.0 services. Mislove et al. [21] studied graph-theoretic properties of OSNs, based on the friends network of Orkut, Flickr, LiveJournal, and YouTube. They confirmed the power-law, small-world, and scale-free properties of these OSN services. Ahn et al. [1] studied the network properties of Cyworld, a popular OSN in South Korea. They compared the explicit friend relationship network with the implicit network created by messages exchanged on Cyworld’s guestbook. They found similarities in both networks: the in-degree and out-degree were close to each other, and social interaction through the guestbook was highly reciprocal.

Liben-Nowell et al. [19] analyzed the geographical location of LiveJournal users and found a strong correlation between friendship and geographic proximity. Krishnamurthy et al. [17] analyzed an OSN formed by users on Twitter. They examined the geographical spread of Twitter usage and also analyzed user behavior in this environment. Huberman et al. [14] showed that Twitter users have a small number of friends compared to the number of followers they declare.

Golder et al. [11] analyzed temporal access and social patterns in Facebook. They analyzed the message headers exchanged by Facebook users, revealing periodic patterns in terms of messages exchanged on that network. Gjoka et al. [10] studied application usage workloads in Facebook and the popularity of applications. Nazir et al. [22] similarly analyzed application characteristics in Facebook, by developing and launching their own applications.

Wilson et al. [33] proposed the use of interaction graphs to impart meaning to online social links by quantifying user interactions. They analyzed interaction graphs derived from Facebook user traces and showed that they exhibit significantly lower levels of the "small-world" properties shown in their social graph counterparts. Valafar et al. [29] conducted a measurement study of the Flickr OSN and showed that only a small fraction of users in the main component of the friendship graph is responsible for the vast majority of user interactions.

Burke et al. [3] studied user motivations for contributing in social networking sites, based on server log data from Facebook. They found that newcomers who see their friends contributing go on to share more content themselves. Furthermore, those who were initially inclined to contribute, receiving feedback and having a wide audience, were also predictors of increased sharing. Chapman and Lahav [6] conducted survey interviews and analysis of web browsing patterns of 36 users of four different nationalities to examine ethnographical differences in the usage of OSNs.

Compared to the studies above, we focused on characterizing the workload of all user activities, beyond the use of a single application and including all silent activities like browsing.

### 8. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a thorough characterization of social network workloads, based on detailed clickstream data summarizing HTTP sessions over a 12-day period of 37,024 users. The data were collected from a social network aggregator website, which after a single authentication enables users to connect to multiple social networks: Orkut, MySpace, Hi5, and LinkedIn. We analyzed the statistical and distributional properties of most of the important variables of OSN sessions. We presented the clickstream model to characterize user behavior in online social networks.

Our study uncovered a number of interesting findings, some of which are related to the specific nature of social networking environments. Many previous social network studies reconstructed user actions from "visible" artifacts, such as comments and testimonials. Using the clickstream model, we underscored the presence of "silent" user actions, such as browsing a profile page or viewing a photo of a friend. These results led us to classify social interactions into two groups, composed of publicly visible activities and silent activities, respectively.

Our current and future work is focused on leveraging the results presented in this paper along three main directions:
1. **Impact of Friends on User Behavior**: We would like to investigate the impact of friends on the behavior of social network users. The success of a social networking site is directly associated with the quality of content users share. Thus, understanding factors that motivate users to join communities, become fans of something, and upload or retrieve media content is key to designing social network services.
2. **Content Distribution Patterns Across Multiple OSNs**: We are interested in understanding content distribution patterns across multiple OSNs. We would like to know to what extent content is shared across OSN sites and explore the impact of age, content, and geographical locality in object popularity. Given that users participate in multiple social networks, we expect that a user may share the same content across multiple sites. Answering these questions will let us explore opportunities for efficient content distribution, such as caching and pre-fetching, as well as advertisement and recommendation strategies.
3. **Building a Social Network Workload Generator**: Based on our analysis, we plan to build a social network workload generator that incorporates many of our findings, including the statistical distributions of sessions and requests and the Markov models for user behavior.
