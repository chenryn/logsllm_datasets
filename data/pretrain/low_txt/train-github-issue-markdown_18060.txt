The pre-release version of Julia (0.3.0-prerelease-d2d9bd93ed) for macOS 10.6 64-bit crashes immediately upon launch on an iMac10,1 running Mac OS X 10.6.8 with an Intel Core 2 Duo 3.06 GHz processor. Although I do not have any debugging tools available on this machine, I suspect the issue may be related to an illegal instruction.

In contrast, Julia 0.2 for macOS 10.6 64-bit operates without any issues.
