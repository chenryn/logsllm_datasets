### Intermediate Certificate Impact on HTTPS Security

An intermediate certificate has signed 26% of currently valid HTTPS certificates. If the private key for this intermediate authority were compromised, 26% of websites relying on HTTPS would need to be immediately issued new certificates. Until these websites deploy the new certificates, browsers would present certificate warnings for all HTTPS communications. While it is not inherently concerning that a small number of organizations control a large percentage of the CA market, it is worrying that large CAs are not following simple precautions and instead are signing a large number of leaf certificates using a small number of intermediates.

### Browser Root Certificate Stores

Microsoft, Apple, and Mozilla each maintain a distinct set of trusted signing certificates, which we refer to as root authorities. Google Chrome uses the OS root store in Windows and macOS, and relies on the root store maintained by Mozilla on Linux. Combined, these three groups trust 348 root authorities, but there are significant discrepancies between the root certificates trusted by each organization. For example, as shown in Table 6, Windows trusts 125 additional authorities that are not present in any other OS or browser.

| Systems Valid In | Roots | CAs | Signed Certificates |
|------------------|-------|-----|---------------------|
| Windows Only     | 125   | 283 | 24,873              |
| Mozilla Only     | 2     | 3   | 23                  |
| Apple Only       | 26    | 30  | 3,410               |
| Windows & Mozilla| 32    | 97  | 12,282              |
| Windows & Apple  | 31    | 47  | 9,963               |
| Mozilla & Apple  | 3     | 3   | 0                   |
| All Browsers     | 109   | 1,346| 8,945,241           |

**Table 6: Differences in Browser and OS Root Stores**  
While there are significant differences in the root certificate stores, 99.4% of trusted certificates are trusted in all major browsers.

The differences in the root stores lead to 463 partially trusted CAs. Most of these partially trusted authorities belong to government, regional, or specialty issuers. Only one, ipsCA, advertised itself as a commercial authority and sold certificates to the global market. However, its certificates are not trusted in Mozilla Firefox or on macOS. Further investigation indicates that ipsCA was in the Mozilla root store in 2009 but was removed after several violations, including the issuance of embedded-null prefix certificates, unavailability of OCSP servers, and the issuance of leaf certificates with validity periods beyond the lifetime of the root CA certificate.

These 463 partially trusted authorities have little presence on the Internet. In total, they have signed certificates for only 51 domains in the Alexa Top 1 Million and for one domain in the Alexa Top 10,000, which belongs to mci.ir, an Iranian telecommunications company. Of the 348 root certificates, 121 of the authorities never signed any leaf certificates seen in our study, and 99.4% of the leaf certificates trusted by any browser are trusted in all browsers.

### Name Constraints

While it is not inherently problematic to provide signing certificates to third-party organizations, these certificates should be restricted to a limited set of domains. Instead, all but 7 CAs in our March 22 scan can sign for any domain. X.509 Name Constraints provide a technical mechanism by which parent authorities can limit the domains for which an intermediate signing certificate can sign leaf certificates. Ideally, signing certificates provided to third-party organizations, such as universities or corporations, would utilize name constraints to prevent potential abuse and limit the potential damage if the signing certificate were compromised.

We find that only 7 trusted intermediate authorities out of 1,832 have name constraints defined, of which 3 were labeled as Comodo testing certificates. The remaining 4 are:
1. An intermediate provided by AddTrust AB to Intel, limited to a small number of Intel-owned domains.
2. An intermediate controlled by the U.S. State Department and provided by the U.S. Government root authority, prevented from signing certificates with the .mil top-level domain.
3. An intermediate provided to the Louisiana State University Health System, limited to a small number of affiliated domains.
4. A root certificate belonging to the Hellenic Academic and Research Institutions Certification Authority, restricted to the .gr, .eu, .edu, and .org domains.

### Path Length Constraints

A signing authority can limit the number of intermediate authorities that can appear below it in a certificate chain by specifying an X.509 path length constraint on the intermediate certificates it signs. This is frequently used to prevent intermediate authorities from further delegating the ability to sign new certificates.

In our dataset, we find that 43% of signing certificates do not have any path length restriction defined. While this may not be a concern for large commercial CAs, more than 80% of the intermediate authorities belonging to other types of organizations (e.g., corporations, academic, and financial institutions) lack such restrictions. Although we saw little evidence of non-commercial CAs providing signing certificates to third-party organizations, we did observe governments using their intermediate authority to sign subordinate CA certificates for corporations within their country.

### Authority Key Usage

All of the browser-trusted leaf certificates in our study were signed using an RSA key. As shown in Table 8, over 95% of browser-trusted certificates were signed with 2048-bit RSA keys. We also note 6 browser-trusted authorities with ECDSA keys belonging to Symantec, Comodo, and Trend Micro. However, we found no trusted certificates that were signed using an ECDSA certificate.

Surprisingly, we find that 243 (13%) of the browser-trusted signing certificates were signed using a weaker key than they themselves contained. In all of these cases, the weakest key was the root authority. While only 58 (15.2%) of the 348 browser root authorities use 1024-bit RSA keys, these keys were used to indirectly sign 48.7% of browser-trusted certificates. In all of these cases, the CA organization also controlled a browser-trusted 2048-bit root certificate that could be used to re-sign the intermediate certificate.

NIST recommends that the public stop using 1024-bit keys in 2016 based on the expected computational power needed to compromise keys of this strength. However, as seen in Figure 5, more than 70% of CA certificates using 1024-bit keys expire after this date, and 57% of roots using 1024-bit RSA keys have signed children that expire after 2016. Figure 3 shows how certificate authorities are using certificates valid for up to 40 yearsâ€”far beyond when their keys are expected to be compromisable. Most worryingly, it does not appear that CAs are moving from 1024-bit roots to more secure keys. As shown in Figure 4, we find only a 0.08% decrease in the number of certificates dependent on a 1024-bit root authority in the past year. In 2012, 1.4 million new certificates were issued that were rooted in a 1024-bit authority, and 370,130 were issued between January and April 2013.

### Leaf Certificates and Hosting

Over the last 14 months, we collected 6.93 million unique trusted certificates. In our March 22 scan, we observed 3.2 million unique trusted certificates from 21.4 million hosts. In this section, we discuss the dynamics of these trusted leaf certificates and the hosts serving them.

#### Keys and Signatures

**Public Keys**  
In line with previous studies, we find that over 99% of trusted leaf certificates contain RSA public keys. We provide a breakdown of leaf key types in Table 9. Over the course of the past year, we found 47 certificates that contain ECDSA public keys; none were present in our March 22 scan and none were browser-trusted. Recently, Google began to use ECDSA certificates for several services, but these sites are only accessible through the use of server name indication (SNI) and do not appear in our dataset.

We find 2,631 browser-trusted certificates using 512-bit RSA keys, which are known to be easily factorable, and 73 certificates utilizing 768-bit keys, which have been shown to be factorable with large distributed computing efforts. While a large number of these certificates were found being actively hosted, only 16 have not yet expired or been revoked. No browser-trusted authorities have signed any 512-bit RSA keys since August 27, 2012. We were further encouraged to find that less than 4% of valid trusted certificates used 1024-bit keys.

**Weak Keys**  
Previous studies have exposed the use of weak keys in the HTTPS space. We revisit several of these measurements and provide up-to-date metrics. Following up on the study performed by Heninger et al., we find that 55,451 certificates contained factorable RSA keys and are served on 63,293 hosts, a 40% decrease in the total percentage of hosts with factorable keys, but only a slight decrease (1.25%) in the raw number of hosts found using factorable keys since 2011. Three of the factorable certificates are browser-trusted; the last was signed on August 9, 2012. 2,743 certificates contained a Debian weak key, of which 96 were browser-trusted, a 34% decrease from 2011. The last browser-trusted certificate containing a Debian weak key was signed on January 25, 2012.

**Figures and Tables**

- **Figure 4: Temporal Trends in Root Key Size**  
  We find that 48.7% of browser-trusted leaf certificates are dependent on 1024-bit RSA-based root authorities, contrary to recommended practice.

- **Figure 5: Expiration of 1024-bit Root Certificates**  
  This figure shows when trusted 1024-bit RSA CA certificates expire. More than 70% expire after 2016, when NIST recommends discontinuing the use of 1024-bit keys.

- **Figure 6: CDF of Certificate Removal**  
  We find that 20% of expiring certificates and 19.5% of revoked certificates are removed retroactively (to the right of 0 days).
