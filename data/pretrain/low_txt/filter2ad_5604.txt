## Abstract
The 3rd ACM Workshop on Information Sharing and Collaborative Security (WISCS'16) aims to advance the scientific foundations for sharing security-related data. Enhancing information sharing remains a critical theme in the computer security community. New sharing communities have emerged, and "threat intelligence" from open, commercial, or governmental sources has become an essential tool for detecting and mitigating attacks in organizations. Security vendors are developing new technologies for sharing, managing, and consuming such data. The OASIS Technical Committee for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is creating a standard for structured information sharing, reflecting the broad interest in this topic.

As real-world deployments of information sharing progress, they continue to raise intriguing technical challenges. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the success of sharing efforts and will benefit from the diverse knowledge and techniques of the scientific community.

WISCS'16 brings together experts and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present innovative research, case studies, and legal and policy issues. The workshop is held in Vienna, Austria, on October 24, 2016, in conjunction with the 23rd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2016).

## Introduction
For several years, security technologists have advocated for increased sharing of security and threat-related data. However, perceived risks and reputational implications have been significant barriers for organizations. Recent progress has been made in overcoming these obstacles. For example, the Cybersecurity Act in the US and the NIS Directive in the EU now provide better legal frameworks for information sharing. Highly publicized, sophisticated attacks have also highlighted the need for more effective sharing among organizations.

New sharing groups, such as those in the retail and healthcare sectors, have been formed. Existing communities like the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) and the IT ISAC are using new technologies for automated sharing of security indicators and other information. Some of the technologies discussed at this workshop have applications beyond traditional cybersecurity, such as sharing information about cyber-physical systems (e.g., SCADA systems) or secure sharing of information on suspects (as the EU is trying to establish after recent terror attacks).

The practical benefits of information sharing are well-recognized, but the scientific basis is less clear. Fundamental problems arise in various scientific contexts and require an interdisciplinary approach. Relevant fields include:
- Economics of security (why share information?)
- Intrusion detection (what information to share and how to use it?)
- Privacy (how to protect intangible assets like privacy and reputation?)

Despite the increased adoption of information sharing, significant challenges remain. For instance, sharing low-level indicators without contextual information offers limited value. We need better methods to add context to indicators. Quality control and false positive rates are also common concerns for practitioners. Additionally, sharing behavior in many communities is skewed, with a small number of participants contributing the majority of data, potentially limiting their effectiveness.

We are optimistic that the science of information sharing, as advanced in the WISCS workshop series, will address these and other challenges, thereby improving the overall level of protection against cyber intrusions.

## Program Format
WISCS'16 is a one-day workshop held in Vienna, Austria, on October 24, 2016, as a pre-conference event to the 23rd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2016). The workshop begins with a one-hour keynote, followed by paper presentations.

All submissions were peer-reviewed by at least three program committee members. The workshop received 26 submissions, and we expect to accept around 9 full papers. The number of submissions increased by over 50% from WISCS'15.

## Conclusion
WISCS is the first workshop dedicated solely to the scientific aspects of sharing threat and security-related data. While the practical benefits of information sharing are well-recognized, the scientific basis is less clear. We anticipate that the WISCS workshop series will generate new insights and impulses towards a scientific foundation and new technologies for information sharing.

## Workshop Organizers
- **Dr. Florian Kerschbaum (Program Co-Chair)**: Chief Research Expert at SAP, Karlsruhe, Germany. His research interests include applied cryptography, security and privacy in cloud computing, big data, and cyber-physical systems. He has authored 100 papers and holds 50 patents. He was the program chair of ACM SACMAT 2015, 2016, and ACM CCSW 2015 and serves as an associate editor of ACM TISSEC and IEEE TDSC. He holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, a master's degree from Purdue University, and a bachelor's degree from Berufsakademie Mannheim.
- **Dr. Erik-Oliver Blass (Program Co-Chair)**: Senior Researcher at Airbus Group Innovations, Munich, Germany. Before joining Airbus, he was a research professor at Northeastern University and a senior researcher at EURECOM, France. His current focus is on applied cryptography and the design of new cryptographic protocols. His work has been recognized with best paper awards from NDSS'14, ACSAC'13, and WiSec'13. He holds a MS and a PhD (with highest honors) in computer science from Universität Karlsruhe, Germany. His thesis was awarded the prize for the best thesis on security research by Germany’s “data security organization (GDD)”. He is a visiting research assistant professor at Northeastern University, Boston.
- **Dr. Tomas Sander (Steering Committee)**: Senior Researcher at Hewlett-Packard Labs, Princeton, NJ, USA. He is a member of the Security and Cloud Lab at HP, which conducts research in security, privacy, and cloud technologies. Before joining HP, he worked at InterTrust Technologies in Santa Clara, California, on advanced digital rights management (DRM). He received a doctoral degree in Mathematics from the University of Dortmund, Germany, in 1996. From 1996 to 1999, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley, California. His research interests include computer security, privacy, and cryptography. He is the lead scientist for HP’s Threat Central technology, a platform for automated and manual security information sharing.
