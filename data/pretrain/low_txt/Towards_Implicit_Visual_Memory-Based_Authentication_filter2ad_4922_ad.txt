### VII. Security Analysis / Discussion

In the proposed authentication scheme, the priming effect of Mooney images is leveraged to help users memorize their authentication secret using implicit rather than explicit memory. However, it is important to note that, similar to graphical authentication schemes based on explicit memory, the security of this scheme relies on the subset IP (primed images) and does not depend on the properties of Mooney images themselves. Our security model considers a powerful attacker who (artificially) knows the solution (label) for every image but still fails to authenticate. While there is an indirect dependency, as a weak priming effect will typically be compensated by a lower threshold to control the false acceptance rate (FAR), making attacks easier, once a catalog of images with good priming properties is used (e.g., di > 0.5, see Figure 6), the scheme is resilient to rate-limited guessing attacks.

All users of the authenticating service share the same set I of such images (IP, IN ⊂ I). Thus, selecting the images is a one-time task. The secret used for authentication is the set of primed images IP, which is a randomly chosen subset of all images presented to the user in the authentication phase (IP ∪ IN). This random selection eliminates any bias in user choice, facilitating the security analysis. The authentication score computed by our scheme is based not only on the primed images the user can identify but also on the non-primed images that an adversary cannot determine. Consequently, an adversary who can decode Mooney images without going through the priming phase has no advantage in breaking the security of the proposed scheme if it is unknown which images the victim was primed on. Additionally, a user connecting to the server under a false username and obtaining the presented images does not affect the security. To avoid intersection attacks, it is mandatory that the same set of non-primed images IN is presented at each login attempt.

### VIII. Conclusion

Authentication schemes based on implicit memory relieve the user of the burden of actively remembering a secret, such as a complicated password. This paper presents a new implicit memory-based authentication scheme that significantly improves previous work by using a more efficient imprinting mechanism, namely Mooney images, and optimizing the scoring mechanism. We implemented a comprehensive prototype and analyzed the performance and security of our proposal in a series of experiments. The results are promising and show that our scheme is particularly suited for applications where timing is not overly critical, such as fallback authentication.
