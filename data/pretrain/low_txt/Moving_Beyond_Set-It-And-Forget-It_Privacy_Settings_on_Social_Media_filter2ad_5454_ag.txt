#### 27. Additional Figures
- This appendix presents a series of supplementary graphs and tables.
- First, we present four additional graphs for our predictive models, showing the relative performance of the different classifiers we tested on the same data.
- We then present two graphs analogous to those in the paper showing temporal patterns in the number of Facebook friends per participant and the privacy settings of posts.
- Different from the analogous graphs in the paper that included only the cohort whose accounts were at least a decade old, these variants show data from all participants.
- Finally, we include Table 6, which details the features we extracted from our survey or programmatically collected and then leveraged in our prediction task. These features are divided into four categories.

**Figure 11: Precision vs. Recall for the Friend-Post Dataset**
- (a) Average Precision@k on full test set
- (b) Average Precision@k on test without label “doesn’t matter”

**Figure 12: Average Precision@k for Post Dataset**

**Figure 13: The Percentage of Participants’ 2018 Facebook Friends Who Were Their Facebook Friends in the Past**
- The number in parentheses indicates how many participants had an account in that year.

**Figure 14: Starting from 2006, the Yearly Percentage of Participants’ Posts Shared with Different Privacy Settings**
- Each participant’s set of posts takes up an equal amount of space on the y-axis. The majority of posts for all years are “friends only.”

**Table 6: A Detailed Enumeration of All Features We Used in Our Predictive Model**
- **Category: Account (User) Features**
  - The age of the account (in years)
  - Whether the participant had used Facebook’s Privacy Check-Up

- **Category: Content Based Features**
  - Whether the post text contains words from the LIWC categories (e.g., religious, swear, anger, etc.) [74]. We obtained 63 categories for our dataset; each category corresponds to one feature. We used one-hot encoding to obtain binary feature values.
  - Whether the post text is classified into any of the Google content-classification categories (e.g., arts, politics, culture, and entertainment) [30]. We obtained 21 categories for our dataset; each category corresponds to one feature. We used one-hot encoding to obtain binary feature values.
  - Sentiment score of the post text computed by the Google Cloud Natural Language engine [30].
  - Google News Word2Vec embeddings [55] of the post text.
- **Category: Audience Based Features (for Specific Friends)**
  - Number of days since first communication
  - Number of days since last communication
  - Number of days between first and last communication
  - Number of friends of the participant
  - Number of wall posts exchanged between the participant and the friend (we also used a normalized version as a separate feature)
  - Number of words exchanged via wall posts and comments (we also used a normalized version as a separate feature)
  - Number of intimate [74] wall words exchanged (we also used a normalized version as a separate feature)
  - The number of likes and reactions that the participant gave on the friend’s wall posts or the friend gave on the participant’s wall posts (we also used a normalized version as a separate feature)

This structured and organized format should make the survey and its sections clearer and more professional.
