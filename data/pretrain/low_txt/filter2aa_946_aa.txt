**ORDER AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION**

This case pertains to the World of Warcraft (WoW) computer game and a software program known as Glider, which automates gameplay for its users while they are away from their computers. MDY Industries, LLC (MDY), the owner and distributor of Glider, sought a declaratory judgment that Glider does not infringe on the rights of Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. and Vivendi Games, Inc. (collectively, "Blizzard"), the owners and distributors of WoW. (Dkt. #5). In response, Blizzard filed a counterclaim and a third-party complaint against Michael Donnelly, the founder of MDY, alleging seven claims: tortious interference with contract, contributory copyright infringement, vicarious copyright infringement, violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), trademark infringement, unfair competition, and unjust enrichment. (Dkt. #10).

The Court partially granted the parties' summary judgment motions, holding MDY liable to Blizzard for tortious interference with contract, contributory copyright infringement, and vicarious copyright infringement. (Dkt. #82). The Court also granted summary judgment to MDY on the portion of Blizzard’s DMCA claim related to the game client software code and on Blizzard's unfair competition claim. (Id.). Blizzard then moved for a permanent injunction on its tortious interference and copyright infringement claims, which the Court denied without prejudice. (Dkt. #91).

Following this ruling, Blizzard dismissed its trademark infringement and unjust enrichment claims, and the parties stipulated that Blizzard would recover $6,000,000 in damages from MDY if any of the tortious interference or copyright infringement claims were upheld on appeal. (Dkt. ##94-95). The parties agreed that the Court should hold a bench trial to determine the remaining DMCA claims, whether Donnelly was personally liable, and whether Blizzard was entitled to a permanent injunction. (Dkt. ##92, 96).

The bench trial took place on January 8 and 9, 2009. (Dkt. ##100-02). On January 28, 2009, the Court issued an order setting forth its findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that MDY is liable under the DMCA, Donnelly is personally liable for MDY’s tortious interference, copyright infringement, and DMCA violations, and that Blizzard is entitled to a permanent injunction. (Dkt. #108).

As requested by the Court (id. at 22), the parties have submitted memoranda addressing three issues: (1) the scope of the injunction, (2) whether the injunction should be stayed pending appeal, and (3) what bond should be imposed for Blizzard’s protection during the appeal. (Dkt. ##109, 111).

**I. Scope of the Injunction**

Injunctive relief is designed to deter, not punish. *Rondeau v. Mosinee Paper Corp.*, 422 U.S. 49, 62 (1975). When issuing a permanent injunction, a district court should include terms that are directly related to the specific needs of the case and the conduct for which the defendant has been held liable. *MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.*, 518 F. Supp. 2d 1197, 1126-27 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (citing *NLRB v. Express Publ’g Co.*, 312 U.S. 426, 435 (1941)). “Blanket injunctions to obey the law are disfavored.” *Id.* at 1226.

MDY has been found liable for tortious interference with the contract between Blizzard and WoW users, contributory and vicarious copyright infringement, and DMCA violations. (Dkt. ##82, 108). The Court will enjoin MDY from engaging in acts of the same type and class as those found unlawful. *Express Publ’g Co.*, 312 U.S. at 435; *Rondeau*, 422 U.S. at 62. To ensure the injunctions are specifically tailored, separate injunctions are set forth at the end of this order for (1) the copyright and DMCA claims and (2) the tortious interference claim.

**II. Stay of Injunction Pending Appeal**

MDY seeks a stay of the injunctions pending appeal. (Dkt. #111). The Court has discretion to grant a stay under Rule 62(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Such a stay is an extraordinary remedy and should be granted sparingly. *Ariz. Contractors Ass’n, Inc. v. Candelaria*, No. CV07-02496-PHX-NVW, 2008 WL 486002, at *1 (D. Ariz. Feb. 19, 2008) (citations omitted); *In re GTI Capital Holdings, LLC*, No. 03-07923-SSC, 2008 WL 961112, at *6 (D. Ariz. Bankr. Apr. 4, 2008). MDY carries a heavy burden to demonstrate that the stay is warranted. *McCammon v. United States*, 584 F. Supp. 2d 193, 197 (D.D.C. 2008); *Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Bd. of Educ. v. Scott*, 404 U.S. 1221, 1231 (1971) (Burger, C.J.). MDY must show either (1) a probability of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury, or (2) that serious legal questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in its favor. *Golden Gate Rest. Ass’n v. City & County of S.F.*, 512 F.3d 1112, 1115-16 (9th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted); *Stormans Inc. v. Selecky*, 526 F.3d 406, 408 (9th Cir. 2008); *Hilton v. Braunskill*, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987). The Court must also consider whether a stay will harm Blizzard and whether the public interest supports the issuance of a stay. *Id.*

**A. Stay of the Copyright and DMCA Claims**

**1. Likelihood of Success or Serious Questions Raised on Appeal**

MDY and Donnelly assert that serious questions exist regarding the correctness of the Court’s rulings on the copyright and DMCA claims, supported by draft articles and third-party commentary. (Dkt. #111-3). The Court acknowledges that these issues are debatable and that reasonable minds can disagree on whether the copyright and DMCA claims were decided correctly. (Dkt. #108 at 22). The Court applied binding Ninth Circuit law on the scope of a license, ownership of WoW software, and whether copying to RAM constitutes “copying” under the Copyright Act. (Dkt. #82 at 6-12, 13-16, 6 & n. 4). The Ninth Circuit may reconsider its position on some or all of these issues during the appeal. Therefore, the Court concludes that the appeal will raise serious questions concerning the copyright and DMCA claims.

**2. Balance of Hardships**

The Court must determine whether the balance of hardships tips sharply in favor of MDY and Donnelly. *Golden Gate Rest. Ass’n*, 512 F.3d at 1115-16. The Court finds that it does. While Blizzard spends approximately $83,000 per month combating Glider and other bots, it generates approximately $1,500,000 per month from WoW. Thus, the quantifiable injury to Blizzard from staying the injunction would amount to less than one-tenth of one percent of its monthly revenue. In contrast, MDY and Donnelly would likely be put out of business by the permanent injunction. Even if the injunction is ultimately overturned on appeal, MDY and Donnelly may lose their market share to competitors and be unable to regain their business. Given the serious questions to be raised on appeal, the Court concludes that the hardships to be suffered by MDY and Donnelly from a permanent injunction substantially outweigh the hardships to be suffered by Blizzard if the injunction is stayed pending appeal. *In re Hayes Microcomputer Prods., Inc. Patent Litig.*, 766 F. Supp. 818, 823 & n.4 (N.D. Cal. 1991) (balance of hardships favored stay of injunction where defendants could be put out of business before an appeal is heard).

**3. Public Interest**

While the public interest generally favors preserving Blizzard’s copyright interests and preventing the exploitation of WoW by MDY and Donnelly, the Court of Appeals may change its position on pivotal legal issues, resulting in a different outcome. Given the serious legal questions and the balance of hardships, the Court concludes that a stay of the injunction is appropriate.
