The area is proficient in regularly using console patches to connect multiple agencies across different systems, including an ultra-high frequency (UHF) system. The use of these console patches and the UHF shared system was effectively demonstrated during the TICP validation exercise. All jurisdictions were familiar with the shared system’s use and operation. However, it should be noted that Morgantown does not have any radio caches or mutual aid channels available. While the exercise was successful, it did not integrate all state, federal, and selected local agencies (e.g., Monongalia Fire Service), which could present interoperability challenges.

**Recommendations:**
- Involve local, state, and federal agencies (e.g., Monongalia Fire Service, National Guard) in training and exercises.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

### Summary of Existing Technology for Communications Interoperability

**Technology Overview:**
Agencies within the Tri-County area operate on multiple conventional, very high frequency (VHF), and UHF radio systems. Interoperability is achieved through console patches and the West Virginia Interoperable Radio Project (WVIRP), a P25 standards-compliant, digital, trunked, UHF radio system. The consoles can patch channels/talk groups from all systems and all counties in the Tri-County area. These consoles are located in three dispatch centers that are staffed 24/7. The Tri-County area will continue to use console patches and the WVIRP radio system, which is expected to be implemented statewide in the future.

### Laramie County (Wyoming) Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

**Summary:**
- **Governance: Advanced Implementation**
- **Standard Operating Procedures: Advanced Implementation**
- **Usage: Advanced Implementation**

**Governance: Advanced Implementation**
The Wyoming Public Safety Communications Commission (PSCC) has successfully established communications interoperability as a public safety priority in the area. The PSCC, created and formalized by state statute in 2004, consists of five working groups with significant local, state, and federal participation. The PSCC is developing and publishing active agreements, such as the WyoLink Handbook and Membership Agreement, but currently operates with informal and undocumented agreements. Laramie County has a strategic plan supporting the use of a shared, statewide system (WyoLink) that allows interoperable communications among the agencies in the area. A long-term funding plan is in place to build, maintain, and operate the WyoLink system through state and federal funding. The governor has prioritized interoperability for public safety agencies in both the state and Laramie County, with proven political and fiscal support.

**Recommendations:**
- Document and formalize necessary agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) including local, state, federal, and tribal partnerships to achieve regional interoperability.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Advanced Implementation**
The area has successfully consolidated separate jurisdictional SOPs (City of Cheyenne and Laramie County’s recently consolidated communications center and SOPs) into the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP). These regional SOPs for interoperability have been distributed to all organizations, and Laramie County plans to participate in additional TICP and Communications Unit Leader training. Updated SOPs will be included in the TICP and disseminated once the WyoLink system is fully operational. Laramie County began implementing NIMS/ICS more than a year ago, and all public safety agencies in the area use these procedures. Command and control were performed successfully during the TICP validation exercise, but the limited scope of the exercise restricted the assessment of regional SOPs and command and control in a multijurisdictional environment. Laramie County plans to expand the TICP to include surrounding jurisdictions in the future.

**Recommendations:**
- Update and disseminate the TICP once the WyoLink system is implemented.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Advanced Implementation**
Laramie County frequently uses gateway console patches in day-to-day operations and shared channels daily. The area fully demonstrated interoperable communications capabilities, including state and federal agencies, although the TICP validation exercise was limited to agencies in Laramie County. Future multijurisdictional exercises should test the use of the new WyoLink system within the area.

**Recommendations:**
- Conduct more robust exercises to test interoperable communications capabilities (e.g., additional participants, additional local, state, federal, and tribal agencies).
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

### American Samoa Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

**Summary:**
- **Governance: Intermediate Implementation**
- **Standard Operating Procedures: Early Implementation**
- **Usage: Early Implementation**

**Governance: Intermediate Implementation**
The Territorial Emergency Communications Committee (TECC), established in 2005, reports to the Office of the Governor and oversaw the creation of the TICP. TECC includes local agencies, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Federal Aviation Administration, representing a positive step in achieving multijurisdictional communications interoperability. However, the area lacks formal interoperable communications agreements and has a mix of formal and informal partnerships among public safety organizations. American Samoa does not have a strategic plan for regional interoperable communications but has initiated planning efforts. Jurisdictions develop budgets through federal grant money allocations, with no other sustainable funding sources. Interoperable communications planning began in 2005, but no additional federal grant monies have been allocated for future investments and lifecycle costs. Leadership in American Samoa provides political support for regional interoperability.

**Recommendations:**
- Clarify federal membership in the decision-making group (e.g., TECC) and document roles and responsibilities.
- Develop, document, and formalize agreements (e.g., signed MOUs with defined roles and responsibilities) among all participating agencies relating to regional interoperability.
- Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., MOUs, intergovernmental agreements) in the TICP and store them in an accessible format, establishing a regular review process.
- Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational TICP) with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, taking into account a long-term communications funding strategy.
- Align regional and territorywide strategic planning efforts to ensure regional needs are met.
- List near-term territorywide interoperability funding priorities and identify a funding plan.
- Develop and implement a territorywide approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) sustainable funding consistent with the strategic plan.
- Continue to champion a governance structure that supports regional communications interoperability and involve senior regional government leadership in long-term funding plans.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Early Implementation**
The SOPs in the American Samoa TICP represent the area’s first regional plan for interoperable communications. Despite adoption by all participating agencies, no steps have been taken to disseminate the TICP to ensure its incorporation in operations. During the exercise, participants did not demonstrate proficiency in executing TICP policies and procedures. The area has not yet begun to implement NIMS/ICS, and participants were unable to demonstrate proficiency during the exercise.

**Recommendations:**
- Develop regional interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP) with acceptance by first responder agencies.
- Distribute and put SOPs into practice throughout the territory through regular training, exercises, and usage.
- Develop training policies and requirements for inclusion in the TICP to ensure broad understanding of the SOPs.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Early Implementation**
American Samoa does not frequently encounter situations requiring communications interoperability solutions, but its shared system is used for day-to-day operations. TICP validation exercise participants primarily communicated face-to-face rather than using interoperable communications equipment. They demonstrated some familiarity with gateways when required, but the limited scope of the exercise did not fully stress their interoperable communications capabilities. Participants encountered language barriers due to the mix of English and Samoan in the exercise and documentation.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise deployment of and procedures for the territory’s interoperability resources (e.g., gateways) to improve proficiency and familiarity of use.
- Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day activities.

**Technology Overview:**
Public safety personnel use a UHF radio system with one channel for fire and police. Additional channels have been found, and the Territorial Office of Homeland Security will work with the Department of Public Safety to use them. Emergency Medical Services use their own UHF radio system, and Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting use an aviation band VHF radio system. All radio systems have severe coverage and maintenance issues. The area aims to move toward a P25 compliant radio system for all agencies on the islands and obtain communications links to nearby islands for marine interdiction and mutual aid. Lack of funding is the main issue preventing interoperability progress.

### Guam Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

**Summary:**
- **Governance: Established Implementation**
- **Standard Operating Procedures: Intermediate Implementation**
- **Usage: Intermediate Implementation**

**Governance: Established Implementation**
The Interoperable Communications Working Group (ICWG), which created the TICP, includes all public safety organizations in the area and reports directly to the Homeland Security Advisor and the Governor. Guam operates through one level of government and has formalized agreements within the government. The area is developing additional memoranda of understanding with the Department of Defense (DoD), U.S. Coast Guard, and the National Guard. Although Guam has encountered problems in formalizing an agreement, its efforts to work with DoD are commendable. Guam does not currently have a strategic plan for regional interoperable communications but is developing regional strategic goals. The Guam Police Department provides for the maintenance costs associated with the area’s shared system backbone, but the area lacks a long-term funding strategy for additional lifecycle costs specific to interoperability needs. The Governor and other regional leadership have made regional interoperability a political priority.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to involve area and federal organizations in the decision-making group (e.g., ICWG) and document roles and responsibilities.
- Establish a regular review process to ensure agreements remain current and relevant.
- Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational TICP) with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, taking into account a long-term communications funding strategy.
- Align regional and area-wide strategic planning efforts to ensure regional interoperability needs are met.
- Develop and implement an area-wide approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) sustainable funding consistent with the strategic plan.

**Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Intermediate Implementation**
The SOPs included in the Guam TICP represent the area’s first regional plan for interoperable communications. The area has taken some steps to disseminate the TICP (e.g., TICP Implementation Workshop to train area agencies). During the exercise, participants did not demonstrate familiarity with the TICP policies and procedures. While no training procedures currently exist, there are plans to establish these procedures. NIMS/ICS has not yet been implemented in Guam, but the area is working to establish compliance among public safety organizations.

**Recommendations:**
- Develop regional communications interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP) with acceptance by area first responder agencies.
- Distribute and put SOPs into practice throughout the area through regular training, exercises, and usage.
- Develop training policies and requirements for inclusion in the TICP.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

**Usage: Intermediate Implementation**
Guam uses interoperable communications solutions almost exclusively for mutual aid response efforts. During the TICP validation exercise, participants demonstrated familiarity with console patching but generally were unable to establish interoperable communications among all participating agencies. Shared talk groups noted in the TICP were not programmed into portable radios, and no shared channels were available. Participants demonstrated proficiency in using the area’s shared system (used in day-to-day events).

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise the deployment of and procedures for the area’s communications interoperability resources (e.g., gateway) to improve proficiency.
- Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day activities.

**Technology Overview:**
The Government of Guam (GovGuam) operates an 800 MHz, analog, Motorola Automatic Multiple Site Selection SmartNet™ radio system. All GovGuam agencies use this system. Interoperable communications between GovGuam agencies and their federal partners are achieved through console patching. The SmartNet system is old, and Motorola no longer makes parts for it. Guam is beginning the process of looking into purchasing a new 700 or 800 MHz trunked radio system.
