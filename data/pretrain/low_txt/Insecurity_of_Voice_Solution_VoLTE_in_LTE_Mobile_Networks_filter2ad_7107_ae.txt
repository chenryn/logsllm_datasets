### Control Plane and Port Configuration
The control plane port is consistently set to 49158. This application must be launched before initiating a VoLTE (Voice over LTE) call. During the call setup and termination phases, it is observed that some UDP packets are received. We have verified that these packets belong to the ongoing callâ€™s RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) session.

### Causes and Lessons
VoLTE adoption requires significant upgrades in the mobile network, particularly with the integration of IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem). These upgrades introduce complex operations, which can be exploited for unintended purposes.

### 4.3 Voice-Muted DoS Attack
We have developed an attack that forces a call to be muted rather than completely terminating the call service. Under this attack, the victim can establish the call, but neither party can hear each other after the call is answered. This attack can be executed by malware without root privileges or voice call permissions on the victim's phone. Note that this malware can be embedded into network applications.

#### Steps to Launch the Attack
There are two major steps to execute this attack during an ongoing call:

1. **Learning the RTP Session Ports:**
   - The first step is to quickly identify the ports of the RTP session. We use V6 and/or V7 to achieve this.
   - Exploiting V6 involves scanning multiple ports, but without root privileges, the network socket only returns the error type of ICMP messages, not their content. Therefore, we cannot directly map the scanned ports to the received ICMP messages.
   - To overcome this, we perform a group-based search. We aggregate ports into small groups and compare the smallest delay in each group. We then scan each port in the group with the smallest delay to locate the RTP ports. This process can be completed within 20 seconds on our test phones.
   - V7 offers a faster method to probe session privacy by directly learning the session ID from the initial voice packets, eliminating the need to search for the session ID.

2. **Hijacking the Voice Bearer:**
   - In the second step, the malware hijacks the voice bearer by injecting forged RTP packets with the correct session ID. This action mutes both uplink and downlink voice, even though the attack targets only the uplink traffic.
   - The uplink traffic of RTP packets overloads the Robust Header Compression (RoHC), which is essential for VoLTE voice packet (de)compression. Figure 14 illustrates one run of the aggregated voice-muted attack when V7 is exploited. The malware initiates the DoS attack at the 8th second, after the call is answered, and stops at the 31st second. During the attack period, the voice at both the caller and the callee remains silent for most of the time.
   - Once the session ID is leaked, this attack remains effective until the call ends. The attack is effective regardless of whether the malware is on the caller's or callee's device.

### 5. Recommended Fixes
The proposed defenses address both the network and the device side. The network-side solution includes three measures:

1. **Strict Routing Regulation:**
   - The 4G gateway should enforce strict routing regulations for each bearer, ensuring that traffic carried by the signaling/voice bearer is relayed only between the phone and the signaling server or the media gateway in the IMS core. This eliminates V2 and reduces the urgency to fix V1. However, without fixing V1, the system remains vulnerable to data DoS attacks as precious radio resources might be wasted before packets are dropped by the gateway. This requires upgrading the 4G gateway and adding filters for VoLTE bearers. It may also require extra effort to add all valid servers to a whitelist.

2. **Charging for Signaling Traffic:**
   - The operator should stop practicing free-signaling policies and charge for signaling traffic similar to data traffic. This eliminates V3 and reduces user incentives to exploit VoLTE for data access. However, this requires upgrading the billing system and enabling accounting for signaling packets in the 4G gateway. The main challenge is not technical but business-related, as it requires every user to have a data plan. A supplementary solution is to enable a VoLTE data volume quota for each voice plan, where no extra charges apply if the volume is below the quota.

3. **Resource Allocation Mechanism:**
   - For DoS attacks, a new mechanism is needed to ensure resource allocation to authentic traffic only. One approach is to abandon high-priority QoS for VoLTE, but this would undermine its appealing features. An alternative is to enforce a deferral mechanism. When traffic is detected as fake or junk, the volume is accounted for, and the source is traced back if the volume exceeds a certain threshold. At runtime, if the requested resource exceeds the quota, its priority is decreased. This scheme mitigates, but does not eliminate, preemptive resource waste.

On the device side, we suggest two remedies:

1. **VoLTE Permission:**
   - The mobile OS should implement a VoLTE permission that allows only the dialer app to access the VoLTE interface. Malware should not easily obtain private information. However, this protection can be bypassed on a rooted phone.

2. **Chipset Access Control:**
   - The chipset should enforce stringent access control, verifying the traffic source and destination, as well as session port numbers. This resolves issues in most common settings but cannot prevent voice-muted attacks if a privileged malware is on a rooted phone. This case calls for additional defenses against mobile malware, which complement the above measures.

### 6. Discussion
We clarify several remaining issues:

- **Bugs in Early Deployment:**
  - Some might argue that the revealed problems are implementation bugs in the early stages of deployment. While these vulnerabilities are not hard to address, most are inherent to VoLTE technology itself, not specific carrier misconfigurations. Uncovering these vulnerabilities requires a cooperative understanding of both the mobile device and the network. Top carriers have largely ignored these issues, leaving their networks open to attacks.

- **Symptoms of Incomplete Transition:**
  - These problems can be attributed to the incomplete transition from traditional mobile network mentality to Internet-style thinking. The mobile network has adopted Internet technologies but has not fully adapted to the lack of control over devices, which can be potentially malicious.

- **Blaming Operators:**
  - While LTE operators and users suffer from these attacks, the responsibility should not be solely placed on network carriers. All parties, including device OS and app developers, mobile chipset vendors, network equipment manufacturers, and operators, contribute to the threats. Reshaping voice from CS to PS requires substantial upgrades from all parties.

- **Incentives:**
  - Our focus has been on vulnerabilities, but not on attack incentives. For certain attacks, such as free data access, people are motivated to exploit the loopholes. For other attacks, such as DoS, the motivation might be for fun or self-interest.

### 7. Update
We are working with the industry to resolve the identified issues. We have informed a major chipset vendor of the potential risks and are contacting more vendors regarding VoLTE access control vulnerabilities. Both carriers have been contacted to report and help fix these vulnerabilities. So far, all data-relevant attacks, including free data, overbilling, and data DoS attacks, have been fixed in OP-I carrier networks. The fix for voice DoS attacks and issues in another carrier is ongoing.

### 8. Related Work
Several studies have explored security implications of IMS, SIP, and VoIP. Park et al. modeled the threat and analyzed possible issues in IMS deployment. Other studies examined SIP and VoIP in the Internet context without addressing mobile network issues. Recent reports look into VoLTE security but are limited to issues like caller ID spoofing. Our recent work revealed a voice DoS attack through fine-grained manipulation of signaling messages in VoLTE. Most VoLTE research focuses on performance analysis or deployment planning. To our knowledge, this is the first study on VoLTE security over operational networks, covering both security analysis and real-world impact.

### 9. Conclusion
VoLTE is still in its early phase of global rollout and is naturally prone to easy-to-fix mistakes. However, we aim to address fundamental issues beyond simple bugs. VoLTE requires substantial upgrades on both the infrastructure and device sides. We examine the security implications of VoLTE, showing that it can be exploited to launch attacks against both network operators and individual users. Two key lessons are:
1. VoLTE operates on both control and data planes, requiring concerted efforts between the network infrastructure and end hosts, as well as software and hardware at the device.
2. VoLTE leverages high-priority services in mobile networks, which can serve as an implicit side-channel to leak confidential information. As VoLTE becomes compatible with Internet design, more intelligence is needed at the device and network to address security side-effects.
