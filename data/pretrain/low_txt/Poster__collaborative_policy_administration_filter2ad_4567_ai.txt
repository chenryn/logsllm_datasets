### Reflections on Designing for Social Innovation in the Public Sector: A Case Study in New York City

**Authors:** Eduardo Staszowski, Scott Brown, Benjamin Winter

**Abstract**

Today, systemic, social, economic, and environmental challenges are prompting governments at various levels to reconsider their approach to public service delivery. Recognizing these societal and policy trends, and the need for radical social innovation in the public realm, the DESIS Lab at Parsons the New School for Design initiated the multi-year research program "Public & Collaborative NYC" in 2011. This program investigates the potential of design as a catalyst for social innovation in public services in New York City. In 2012, the DESIS Lab partnered with the Public Policy Lab, a non-profit dedicated to improving public services through design, and the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to develop the project "Designing Services for Housing," which focused on affordable housing in the city.

This article examines the "Designing Services for Housing" project as a case study to identify the challenges designers face when collaborating with public partners to effect social change. Key areas of focus include the acknowledgment of the designer's political position, the recognition and overcoming of epistemological barriers, and the management of risk aversion in the public sector. The article concludes by highlighting the implications of designing for social innovation in the public sector and offers recommendations.

### 1. Introduction & Overview

Today, a range of systemic, social, economic, and environmental challenges is prompting governments at various levels to rethink their approach to public service delivery. Following cuts in public spending and austerity measures to reduce budget deficits, alternatives such as public-private partnerships, new technologies, and increased public participation are being considered. There is a growing perception of the need for new approaches to providing essential services for individuals and communities to thrive. The role of design in this context is still open for exploration and experimentation.

In the United Kingdom, there has been a vigorous debate on the relation of design to public service and social innovation. The Design Commission has claimed that "Design is integral to the DNA of each and every public service." Their recent report emphasizes the value of a design-based approach in promoting the kinds of innovation needed to address the challenges of an increasingly difficult public sector landscape, and the genuine need to provide better services to the public enduring economic instability. However, while the report strongly advocates the beneficial potential of good design, much work remains to be done in thinking about what a participatory, design-driven approach to public service will look like, particularly in the American social and political context.

The common denominator in any new approach is the requirement for new forms of collaboration across various practical domains. Traditional silos separating government apparatus from community action can be broken down to explore new kinds of collaboration. Such partnerships can be facilitated and amplified through more participatory, horizontal practices such as co-governance, co-design, and co-production. Design can play a transformative role in promoting this kind of change. One challenge of a design-driven approach is to accommodate multiple ways of knowing, so that the designer and other experts can employ their distinct forms of knowledge and expertise towards solving a particular problem.

### 1.1 Public & Collaborative NYC

Recognizing the need for radical social innovation in the public realm, the DESIS Lab at Parsons the New School for Design began the multi-year research program "Public & Collaborative NYC" in 2011. This initiative sought to investigate the assertion that design can serve as a catalyst for social innovation in public services in New York City. It aimed to explore the roles design can play in building bridges between city government and people, and the forms of collaboration or strategies for building strong partnerships between public and private actors, local communities, and individuals that will promote such innovation.

### 1.2 Designing Services for Housing

In 2012, with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, Parsons DESIS Lab entered a partnership with the Public Policy Lab and the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to develop "Designing Services for Housing" (DSH). DSH is a two-year design effort exploring ways to engage community residents in the development of services related to city-supported affordable housing development and preservation in neighborhoods with significant public and private sector investment leveraged by HPD. HPD is the largest municipal housing preservation and development agency in the United States, and its mission is "to improve the availability, affordability, and quality of housing in New York City."

The city's affordable housing service landscape consists of a diverse network of government actors, regulatory bodies, private developers, property managers, community-based organizations, tenant associations, and individuals. It is an inherently collaborative field, requiring interaction between many different parties, making it an ideal space to explore the generative possibilities of enhanced forms of collaborative practice between public and private actors. The topic of housing is particularly urgent, as New York City has some of the lowest vacancy rates in the United States, coupled with steadily increasing rent costs. Combined with the challenges of an enduring economic crisis, housing has become a crisis of its own in the city.

DSH was structured around two interconnected project tracks. The first focused on improving HPD’s services and interfaces with current and potential residents of subsidized housing for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers. The second focused on enabling resident social networks and collaborative services in neighborhoods where HPD programs and initiatives are most active, such as the Melrose Commons Urban Renewal Area in the South Bronx. The project began with a series of public lectures and two courses at Parsons that included co-design sessions with HPD staff, students, and Public Policy Lab fellows to create a "kit of ideas" for the agency. The "kit" includes new service ideas for increasing tenants' and landlords' understanding of the city’s housing maintenance code and protection of tenants’ rights, simplifying application processes for affordable units, improving HPD’s information channels and physical spaces, and creating networks among neighbors for mutual support.

During summer and fall of 2012, the design fellows continued to work with HPD managers, front-line staff, community-based organizations, affordable-housing developers, and potential and current users of HPD’s services to identify and refine concepts for further development. Four proposals for enhancing the marketing, lottery, and lease-up processes for affordable housing were selected by HPD to be transformed into pilot projects in 2013. Ideas about how to activate resident social networks and collaborative services around housing-related issues were considered outside the agency’s scope and left as recommendations for future exploration. This work will be published in a document ("The How-To-Guide"), which will provide technical and strategic guidance for the agency to implement the pilot proposals. For the purpose of this article, the "Designing Services for Housing" project serves as a case study to open up the discussion about the role of designers in working with government to effect social innovation in the public sector.

### 2. Evidence & Reflection

During the DSH project, it was observed that designers operating in this space encountered several epistemological, practical, and political challenges. This section describes the nature of the proposals put forward by the design team and examines the specific challenges identified during the project. It concludes by reiterating the implications of these challenges to suggest new possibilities for enhancing interdisciplinary collaboration among design practitioners, educators, civil servants, and policymakers.

#### 2.1 Acknowledging the Political

Current societal challenges are generating the need for radical innovation and the redesign of public services. Governments are challenged with finding new ways to provide better services in the context of broader economic crisis. While often resisting austerity measures and tax increases, the public is simultaneously demanding better services. In this context, a new 'breed' of (service) designers with expertise in user participation appear as 'natural' candidates to help governments evolve and enhance services for the public good.

However, designing in the public sector should not merely involve making the State look user-friendly or making interactions with government a better 'experience.' User-centered approaches (i.e., "user as subject") commonly applied in the private sector cannot be automatically transferred to this context without engaging in a discussion about the socio-political implications of this work. A movement towards a 'participatory' approach (i.e., "user as partner") is not only appropriate but also required. Here, citizens are key stakeholders in public problems and should be considered as participants in the construction of their own futures, not just as users or consumers.

The challenge for designers operating in this space is how to negotiate their inherent political position as agents of change, accountable not to a client or clients who have engaged them for a specific purpose, but to the diverse needs of the broader public(s). Therefore, the traditional client-consultant relationship, in which the designer is an expert beholden to very specific interests, is challenged. In this sense, the work of designers in the public realm is not simply a matter of enhancing existing service structures or maintaining current social practices. It can be thought of in terms of playing a more transformative and political role.

The DSH project is partly an experiment in testing and understanding the limits and opportunities of this new role. For example, DSH explored how designers could be proponents of service co-production in the public sector, or more specifically, how the city could look at collaborative social innovations as inspiration for different forms of public partnership and reshaping public services. Thinking of service provision in this manner can constitute a challenge to the existing order in which public agencies operate. Most of the proposed changes require a shift in the way public agencies think about and deliver services, which can be met with resistance due to entrenched practices and risk aversion.
