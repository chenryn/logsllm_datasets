## Introduction

### Biography
- **Education:** Computer Engineer (RIT)
- **Interests:** Operating systems since high school
- **Employment:** Sandia National Labs, California
- **Focus Areas:** High performance computing, mobile, security
- **Philosophy:** Advocate for open source; goal to make as much work as possible publicly available

### Smartphones
- **Dominance:** Smartphones are ubiquitous.
- **Features:** Pocket-sized computers with phone capabilities, cameras, GPS, accelerometers, email, web browsing, photography, navigation, gaming, password management, two-factor authentication, and Google Wallet.

### Why Smartphones "Kinda Suck"
- **Closed-source:** Blackberry, iPhone, and Windows Phone are all closed-source.
- **Privacy Concerns:**
  - RIM can decrypt messages for governments.
  - iPhones track user movements and are vulnerable to DoS attacks via SMS.
  - Windows Phones are rare but also vulnerable to DoS attacks via SMS.
- **CarrierIQ:** Installed on many devices, raising privacy concerns.

### But Android is Still Cool, Right?
- **Linux-based and Open-source:** Allows for extensive customization.
- **Device Variety:** Available on phones, tablets, and laptops.
- **Developer-friendly:** No fees for development or market placement.
- **Hacking Capabilities:** Users can modify the OS.
- **Community Support:** Large community of developers and hackers.
- **Challenges:**
  - Programming language (Java) may be a barrier.
  - Vendors have little incentive to update the OS.
  - Security concerns, including fake OTA updates and malicious apps.
  - Performance issues with limited hardware resources.

### Android as a Linux Platform
- **Unattractive for Hacking:** Thick layer of Java over a thin Linux base.
- **Standard Linux Underneath:** Includes a small Busybox environment.
- **CyanogenMod:** Offers a more robust environment with bash.
- **Proposal:** Remove Java and build on the Linux foundation, leveraging existing hardware drivers.

### Inferno
- **Open-source OS:** Developed by Bell Labs, now owned by Vita Nuova.
- **Dis Virtual Machine:** Runs natively or hosted on various platforms.
- **Inspired by Plan 9:** Fast compilation and launch, low memory footprint.
- **Total Codebase:** Approximately 1 million lines of code, including applications and native booting code.
- **Advantages:**
  - Utilizes Android's hardware drivers.
  - Simplifies updates without flashing ROMs.

### Android - Java = Linux
- **Eliminate Java:** Start by removing the zygote process from /init.rc.
- **Custom ROMs:** Build your own or use a script to modify and reflash the running boot image.

### Android + Inferno = Hellaphone
- **Adaptation:**
  - Adapt Inferno to build for Android using AGCC scripts.
  - Most Linux code is suitable, with minor tweaks needed.
  - Develop support for hardware components like framebuffers and touchscreens.
  - Modify the window manager for phone compatibility.

### Phone-specific Features
- **devphone:** Interface for radio communication.
- **File System Interface:** For making and receiving calls and handling SMS.
- **User-friendly Apps:** Dialer and SMS applications.
- **WiFi and Audio Drivers:** Early drafts, semi-functional.

### Neat Things to Try
- **Inferno Sandboxing:** One instance of the OS per app.
- **Security Enhancements:**
  - Wipe SD card if accelerometer detects excessive force.
  - Fun with 9P for file sharing and remote access.
  - Anti-theft programs using GPS and camera.

### Conclusion
- **Feasibility:** Stripping down Android for custom purposes is not difficult.
- **Potential:** With additional work, Inferno could be a viable smartphone OS.
- **Benefits:**
  - Fast and lightweight.
  - Easy to develop and maintain.
  - Built-in software and infrastructure.
  - No app store, promoting self-reliance and trust.
