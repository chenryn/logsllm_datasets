### JBoss: An Open-Source Java EE Application Server

**Overview:**
- **Developer:** JBoss, a division of Red Hat
- **Functionality:** Abstracts the infrastructure for Java-based web applications
- **Complexity:** Very large and complex

**Usage Context:**
According to Anil Saldhana, Lead JBoss Security Architect at Red Hat:
> "Over the years, we have understood that JBoss AS will primarily be used by Java EE developers on their desktops to develop business applications. When they are ready to deploy these applications in production, they should follow the security guidelines available on our wiki. There are no reasonable defaults in security to secure the shipped community version of JBoss AS."

**Security Considerations:**
- **Web Interface to MBeans:** JBoss provides a web interface to MBeans, which is installed by default with no security.
- **JBoss Recommendations:** JBoss offers recommendations for securing the JMX Console, but some of these have been proven incorrect, and certain issues remain unaddressed. For more details, refer to the [JBoss Wiki](http://community.jboss.org/wiki/securethejmxconsole).

**Default Login Module:**
- **Configuration File:** `login-config.xml`
- **Default Module:** `org.jboss.security.auth.spi.UsersRolesLoginModule`
- **Limitations:**
  - No enforced password complexity
  - No password lockouts
  - Other security features are also lacking

**HTML Adaptor:**
- **Example Configuration:** Allows only users with the role `JBossAdmin` to access the HTML JMX console web application.

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**
- **Persistent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Can be used to obtain an admin's JSESSIONID.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** Can execute any functionality.
- **Authentication Modules:** Specify the module used for authentication per application, such as `jboss.security:service=XMLLoginConfig`.
- **Loading from Arbitrary URL:** The system can load a new `login-config.xml` from an arbitrary URL.
- **RMI (Remote Method Invocation):** MBeans are exposed over RMI, using a different authentication mechanism than the JMX console. JBoss recommends securing this service.
- **Twiddle and Invoker Servlets:**
  - `/web-console/Invoker`
  - `/invoker/JMXInvokerServlet`
  - These can be used to deploy arbitrary code, including via HTTP or BeanShell Deployer.

**Historical Vulnerabilities:**
- **JBoss 4 and Lower:** Allowed uploading a JSP to an existing app. This was reported in 2006 and "fixed."
- **Directory Traversal:** Not the main issue; JBoss 5.x is still vulnerable.
- **DeploymentFileRepository:** Part of the web console, not the JMX console. Often available even when the JMX console or RMI service is not.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Status Information:** Avoid placing secret tokens in URLs.
- **Google Cache:** Reveals interesting information, such as `?full=true` and `http://www.jboss.com/customers/`.
- **X-Powered-By Header:** May include "Servlet X; JBoss Y" or "Servlet X; Tomcat Y/JBoss Z".
- **Shodan Search Results:** Approximately 12,811 results for "x-powered-by" "jboss".
- **Auth Realm:** "JBoss JMX Console"

This structured and detailed overview should provide a clearer and more professional understanding of JBoss and its security considerations.
