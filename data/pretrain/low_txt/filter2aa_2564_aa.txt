## Motivation
- **4G Standard**: Introduces new technologies and modern services, such as VoLTE, SON, and enhanced trust and control features.
- **BaseStations**: These are the large and small antennas in the field.
- **Research Goals**: To provide visibility into how the 4G environment works, what providers and vendors do, and to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Introduction
- **4G/LTE Telecommunication Network**: An overview of the components and architecture.

### 4G Core Components
- **eUTRAN**: The radio access network.
- **UE (User Equipment)**: End-user devices.
- **eNodeB**: Base stations.
- **MME (Mobility Management Entity)**: Manages session and mobility.
- **PDN-GW (Packet Data Network Gateway)**: Connects to external networks.
- **Serv-GW (Serving Gateway)**: Handles user data.
- **HSS (Home Subscriber Server)**: Stores subscriber information.
- **IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem)**: Supports multimedia services.
- **S1-MME and S1-U**: Interfaces for control and user plane traffic.
- **OSS (Operations Support System)**: Manages network operations.
- **IP Network**: Underlying transport network.

### Typical Environment

## The Idea
1. Understand the BaseStation setup.
2. Purchase an old BaseStation.
3. Set up the BaseStation in an emulated environment.
4. Evaluate the configuration and security.

## Requirements
### Basestation Physical Setup
- **Base Band Unit (BBU)**:
  - Usually located on the ground.
  - Includes Power Distribution Unit (PDU) and Power Supply Unit (PSU).
- **Remote Radio Head/Unit (RRH/RRU)**:
  - Can be placed on the cell mast or on the ground.
  - Antennas come in various shapes and sizes, often vector antennas.
  - All active parts (BBU, RRU, sensors, power supply, vents) are interconnected.
- **Power Supply**:
  - Components run on -48V, not ±48V (96V differential).
  - RF signals are received via fiber and sent out via copper to the antenna.
  - Capable of serving specific frequency bands.

### BBU Details
- **Frame**:
  - Holds the power unit and functional blades.
  - May have a backplane for interconnection between components.
  - Multiple interfaces (LAN, UART, CAN).
- **Functional Blades**:
  - Determine the network type (e.g., Ericsson DUL/DUW/DUG for LTE/WCDMA/GSM).
  - Single BBU can serve multiple network types depending on the blade combination.
  - Single blade can serve multiple cells using sector antennas.

### Variants of eNodeB
- **Form Factors**:
  - Rack, "Small-Boxes," Portable.
- **Cell Sizes**:
  - Macro (>100m), Micro (100m), Pico (20-50m), HeNB (10-20m).
- **Encryption**:
  - Termination point for RF and backend channel encryption.

## Implementing a Lab
- **Ebay Search Tips**:
  - Nokia: FlexiBTS
  - Huawei: BBU + LMPT/UMPT
  - Ericsson: RBS + DUL
  - ALU: MBS

### Lab Setup
- **Requirements**:
  - A BaseStation (RRU is optional if you only want to work with the BTS).
  - Power Supply: -48V ~ 5A.
  - Power Connectors: Be prepared for unusual plugs.
  - Network Cables.

### Our Lab
- **Reconnaissance**:
  - GPS: For timing and positioning.
  - EC: Equipment Control.
  - AUX: Auxiliary Bus.
  - LMT A/B: Local Maintenance Terminals.
  - TN A/B: Backhaul Access – S1.
  - IDL: Inter-DUL-Link.
  - Interfaces towards RRU: A, B, C, D, E, F.

### Initial Analysis
- **First Sniff**:
  - Important interfaces: Vlan 3 (Signalling), Vlan 2 (O&M).
  - Traffic analysis shows that the eNB is designed to operate almost standalone.

- **Second Sniff**:
  - Focus on signalling traffic, local maintenance interface, and remote OAM interface.
  - Goal: Understand the device, gain configuration access, and ultimately achieve root access.

### Transport Interface
- **S1-Interface**:
  - Divided into S1-MME (Control Plane) and S1-U (User Plane).
  - S1-MME carries signalling messages between the base station and MME.
  - S1-U carries user data between the base station and Serving GW.

- **Activation**:
  - After the host on VLAN 2 becomes available, the eNodeB activates communication over the S1-Interface.
  - Uses SCTP to reach 7 different hosts by SCTP INIT request.

### Security Considerations
- **From 3GPP TS 33.401**:
  - IPsec ESP is required for S1 and X2 control and user planes.
  - IKEv2 certificates based authentication is mandatory.
  - In trusted environments, additional protection may not be needed.

### S1-AP
- **S1 Application Protocol (S1AP)**:
  - Designed by 3GPP for the S1 interface.
  - Specified in 3GPP TS36.413.
  - Necessary for procedures between MME and eNodeB.
  - Supports transparent transport procedures.
