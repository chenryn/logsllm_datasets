### Responder MEP Frame Counting and CFM Database
- For a responder MEP, the router counts the number of DMR (Delay Measurement Reply) frames sent.
- Each router stores ETH-DM (Ethernet Delay Measurement) frame counts in the CFM (Connectivity Fault Management) database. The CFM database maintains CFM session statistics and, for interfaces that support ETH-DM, any ETH-DM frame counts.
- You can access these frame counts at any time by displaying CFM database information for Ethernet interfaces assigned to MEPs or for MEPs in CFM sessions.
- **Note**: For a given two-way Ethernet frame delay measurement, frame delay and frame delay variation values are available only at the router that contains the initiator MEP.

### Choosing Between One-Way and Two-Way ETH-DM
- **One-Way Frame Delay Measurement**:
  - Requires that the system clocks at the initiator MEP and receiver MEP be closely synchronized.
  - If synchronization is not practical, one-way measurements may be less accurate.
- **Two-Way Frame Delay Measurement**:
  - Does not require synchronization of the two systems.
  - More accurate when clock synchronization is not feasible.
- When two systems are physically close, their one-way delay values are significantly higher compared to their two-way delay values. MX Series routers currently do not support the granular synchronization required for one-way delay measurements.

### Restrictions for Ethernet Frame Delay Measurement
- The following restrictions apply to the Ethernet frame delay measurement feature:
  - **Unsupported on LSI Pseudowires**: The ETH-DM feature is not supported on label-switched interface (LSI) pseudowires.
  - **Supported on Aggregated Ethernet Interfaces**: The ETH-DM feature is supported on aggregated Ethernet interfaces.
  - **Hardware-Assisted Timestamping**: Supported only for MEP interfaces on Enhanced DPCs and Enhanced Queuing DPCs in MX Series routers. For more details, see "Guidelines for Configuring Routers to Support an ETH-DM Session" and "Enabling the Hardware-Assisted Timestamping Option".
  - **Distributed PPM Daemon Requirement**: Ethernet frame delay measurements can be triggered only when the distributed periodic packet management daemon (ppm) is enabled. For more information, see "Guidelines for Configuring Routers to Support an ETH-DM Session" and "Ensuring That Distributed ppm Is Not Disabled".
  - **Single Session Monitoring**: You can monitor only one session at a time to the same remote MEP or MAC address. For more information, see "Starting an ETH-DM Session".
  - **Statistics Collection**: ETH-DM statistics are collected at only one of the two peer routers in the ETH-DM session. For one-way ETH-DM, you can display frame delay statistics at the receiver MEP only. For two-way ETH-DM, you can display frame delay statistics at the initiator MEP only.
  - **CFM Database Storage**: ETH-DM frame counts are collected at both MEPs and stored in the respective CFM databases.
  - **GRES Impact**: If graceful Routing Engine switchover (GRES) occurs, any collected ETH-DM statistics are lost, and ETH-DM frame counts are reset to zero. GRES allows a router with dual Routing Engines to switch from a primary to a backup Routing Engine without interrupting packet forwarding. For more information, see the Junos OS High Availability User Guide.
  - **System Stability**: Accuracy of frame delay statistics is compromised during system changes (e.g., reconfiguration). It is recommended to perform Ethernet frame delay measurements on a stable system.

### Ethernet Frame Loss Measurement Overview
- The key objectives of OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) functionality are to measure quality-of-service attributes such as frame delay, frame delay variation (jitter), and frame loss. These measurements help identify network problems before they impact customers.
- **Junos OS Support**: Supports Ethernet frame loss measurement (ETH-LM) between maintenance association end points (MEPs) configured on Ethernet physical or logical interfaces on MX Series routers, currently supported only for VPWS (Virtual Private Wire Service).
- **Frame Loss Measurement**: Performed by sending frames with ETH-LM information to a peer MEP and receiving frames with ETH-LM information from the peer MEP. This type of frame loss measurement is also known as single-ended Ethernet loss measurement.
- **MX Series Virtual Chassis**: Does not support Ethernet frame loss measurement (ETH-LM).
- **Supported Frame Loss Measurements**:
  - **Near-end Frame Loss Measurement**: Measures frame loss associated with ingress data frames.
  - **Far-end Frame Loss Measurement**: Measures frame loss associated with egress data frames.
- **Proactive and Dual-Ended Loss Measurement**: Not supported on ACX Series routers.
- **Aggregated Ethernet Interfaces**: The ETH-LM feature is supported on aggregated Ethernet interfaces.
- **Inaccurate Results**: Starting from Junos OS Release 16.1, Ethernet loss measurement (ETH-LM) results are inaccurate when CFM and PM PDUs received locally at a MEP are classified as yellow or medium-high PLP. To avoid this, provision all local CFM PDUs as green or with high PLP.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Not supported on aggregated Ethernet interfaces with member links on DPCs when the NNI or egress interface is involved.

### Service-Level Agreement Measurement
- **SLA Measurement**: Monitors bandwidth, delay, delay variation (jitter), continuity, and availability of a service (E-Line or E-LAN) to identify network problems before they affect customers.
- **Service Classification**:
  - **E-Line Services**: Offered using MPLS-based Layer 2 VPN virtual private wire service (VPWS).
  - **E-LAN Services**: Offered using MPLS-based virtual private LAN service (VPLS).
- **SLA Measurement Modes**:
  - **On-Demand Mode**: Triggered through the CLI.
  - **Proactive Mode**: Triggered by an iterator application.
- **AE Interface**: Ethernet frame delay and loss measurements are not supported on the ae (aggregated Ethernet) interface.

### On-Demand Mode for SLA Measurement
- In on-demand mode, measurements are triggered by the user through the CLI.
- **Delay Measurement**: Uses ITU-T Y.1731 standard frame formats. For two-way delay measurement, server-side processing can be delegated to the Packet Forwarding Engine to prevent overloading the Routing Engine.
- **Loss Measurement**: Sends packets in standard format along with the loss measurement TLV. By default, the session-id-tlv argument is included to allow concurrent loss measurement sessions from the same local MEP. The no-session-id-tlv argument can disable the session ID TLV.
- **Single-Ended ETH-LM**: Used for on-demand OAM purposes. An MEP sends frames with ETH-LM request information to its peer MEP and receives frames with ETH-LM reply information to carry out loss measurements. The PDUs used are referred to as LMM (Loss Measurement Message) and LMR (Loss Measurement Reply).

### Proactive Mode for SLA Measurement
- In proactive mode, SLA measurements are triggered by an iterator application.
- **Iterator Functionality**: Periodically transmits SLA measurement packets in ITU-Y.1731-compliant frames for two-way delay or loss measurement on MX Series routers. Iterators ensure that measurement cycles do not overlap for the same connection to avoid CPU overload.
- **Iterator Support**: Junos OS supports proactive mode for VPWS. For an iterator to form a remote adjacency and become operational, CCM (Continuity Check Message) must be active between the local and remote MEP configurations of CFM.
- **Iterator Limitations**:
  - **DPC/MPC Support**: Only 30 iterator instances with a cycle time of 10 ms are supported per DPC or MPC.
  - **Iterator Profile Configurations**: 255 iterator profile configurations and 2000 remote MEP associations are supported.
  - **Cycle Time**: Iterators with cycle time less than 100 ms are supported only for infinite iterators, while those with cycle time greater than 100 ms are supported for both finite and infinite iterators.
  - **ACX5048/ACX5096 Routers**: Support iterator cycle time of only 1 second and above.
- **Stopping Iterators**: To stop an iterator, use the `deactivate sla-iterator-profile` statement or provision a `disable` statement under the corresponding iterator profile.

### Ethernet Delay and Loss Measurement by Proactive Mode
- **Two-Way Delay Measurement**: The DMM (Delay Measurement Message) frame is triggered through an iterator application. The DMM frame carries an iterator TLV, and the server copies the iterator TLV from the DMM frame to the DMR (Delay Measurement Reply) frame.
- **One-Way Delay Variation Computation**: Based on timestamps in the DMR frame, eliminating the need for client-side and server-side clock synchronization.
- **Proactive Loss Measurement**: The router sends packets in standard format along with loss measurement TLV and iterator TLV.

### Ethernet Failure Notification Protocol Overview
- **FNP (Failure Notification Protocol)**: Detects failures in Point-to-Point Ethernet transport networks on MX Series routers. If a node link fails, FNP detects the failure and sends FNP messages to adjacent nodes to redirect traffic to the protection circuit.
- **E-Line Services**: Provides secure Point-to-Point Ethernet connectivity between two UNIs (User Network Interfaces). FNP provides service circuit failure detection and propagation in less than 50ms and ensures 50ms failover for E-Line services.
- **MX Router Role**: Acts as a PE (Provider Edge) node, handling FNP messages on the management VLAN and Ethernet interfaces. FNP can be enabled only on logical interfaces part of a VPLS routing instance, with no CCM configured on physical interfaces.
- **Edge Protection**: All E-Line services are configured as layer 2 circuits with edge protection. FNP does not control the logical interface associated with the protection circuit. Only E-Line services whose termination point is not in an MX node are controlled by FNP.
- **Graceful Restart and GRES**: FNP supports graceful restart and GRES features.

### Ethernet Synthetic Loss Measurement Overview
- **ETH-SLM (Synthetic Loss Measurement)**: Enables the calculation of frame loss using synthetic frames instead of data traffic. Each MEP performs frame loss measurements, contributing to unavailable time.
- **Frame Loss Types**:
  - **Near-end Frame Loss**: Associated with ingress data frames.
  - **Far-end Frame Loss**: Associated with egress data frames.
- **ITU-T Y.1731 Standards**: Defines two types of frame loss measurement, ETH-LM and ETH-SLM. Junos OS supports only single-ended ETH-SLM.
- **Single-Ended ETH-SLM**: Each MEP sends frames with ETH-SLM request information to its peer MEP and receives frames with ETH-SLM reply information to perform synthetic loss measurements. Used for proactive or on-demand OAM to perform synthetic loss measurements applicable to point-to-point Ethernet connections.
- **MX Series Virtual Chassis**: Does not support Ethernet synthetic loss measurement (ETH-SLM).
- **Layer 2 Services**: ACX5048 and ACX5096 routers support ETH-SLM for Layer 2 services.

### Scenarios for Configuration of ETH-SLM
- **Upstream MEP in MPLS Tunnels**: A MEP is configured between the UNIs of two MX Series routers (MX1 and MX2) in the upstream direction, connected over an MPLS core network. ETH-SLM measurements are performed between the upstream MEP in the path linking the two routers.
- **Downstream MEP in Ethernet Networks**: A MEP is configured between two MX Series routers (MX1 and MX2) on the Ethernet interfaces in the downstream direction. ETH-SLM measurements are performed between the downstream MEP in the path linking the two routers.
- **Service Protection**: Service protection for a VPWS over MPLS is enabled by specifying a working path or protect path on the MEP. To configure service protection, create two separate transport paths—a working path and a protect path. Associate the maintenance association with a path by configuring the MEP interface and specifying the path as working or protect.

### Format of ETH-SLM Messages
- **SLM PDU Format**:
  - **Fields**:
    - **Source MEP ID**: 2-octet field identifying the transmitting MEP.
    - **Test ID**: 4-octet field identifying the test.
    - **TxFCf**: 4-octet field carrying the number of SLM frames transmitted.
- **SLR PDU Format**:
  - **Fields**:
    - **Responder MEP ID**: 2-octet field identifying the responding MEP.
    - **TxFCb**: 4-octet field representing the number of SLR frames transmitted.
- **Data Iterator TLV Format**:
  - **Fields**:
    - **Type**: Identifies the TLV type (Data, value 3).
    - **Length**: Identifies the size of the Value field.
    - **Data Pattern**: An n-octet arbitrary bit pattern, ignored by the receiver.

### Transmission of ETH-SLM Messages
- **Initiation and Transmission of SLM Requests**:
  - A MEP periodically transmits an SLM request with the OpCode field set as 55. The MEP generates a unique Test ID, adds the source MEP ID, and initializes local counters for the session.
- **Reception of SLMs and Transmission of SLRs**:
  - After determining an SLM request by using the test ID, the MEP calculates far-end and near-end frame loss based on the information in the SLM message.
- **Reception of SLRs**:
  - The MEP updates local counters based on the received SLR information.
- **Computation of Frame Loss**:
  - Local counters TxFCl and RxFCl are maintained for each test ID and for each peer MEP being monitored. TxFCl tracks the number of synthetic frames transmitted, and RxFCl tracks the number of synthetic frames received.
