We are currently using CentOS in our Jenkins CI environment and have encountered several challenges when attempting to use Playwright from version 1.15.0. The primary issue is that Playwright requires `GLIBC_2.18`, which is not available in CentOS.

This dependency is preventing us from upgrading Playwright, and it would be greatly beneficial to have support for CentOS 7. For more context, please refer to the related discussion thread: #9194 (comment).

Adding support for CentOS 7 would significantly help us in maintaining and improving our CI environment.
