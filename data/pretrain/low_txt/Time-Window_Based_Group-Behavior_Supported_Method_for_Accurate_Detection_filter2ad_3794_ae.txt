### Significant Rise in Victim's Activity

We observed a significant rise in the activity of our victim, indicating that the widely-used single-day detection methodology may not be effective in identifying such attacks. In contrast, with long-term deviation patterns embedded in behavioral matrices, the waveforms rise after the attack day. Based on this, we argue that long-term signals and group correlations are highly effective in signaling abnormal user behavior.

### VII. Discussion and Future Work

#### A. Challenges with Filtering Benign Anomalies

One might question the importance of group correlation by asking, "Why can't we just filter out common benign anomalies during a specific period?" We argue that this is not always straightforward. While security analysts are sometimes explicitly informed about certain common benign anomalies (e.g., environmental changes), making filtering feasible, such information is often not readily available. To manually filter out false positives (FPs), one must first investigate what happened during a specific period and why/how the anomalies are benign. For example, to conclude that an anomaly is caused by a new service, we need to deduce that (1) several users accessed this service, and (2) this service did not appear in the audit history. After identifying the cause, we need to determine which behaviors are affected (e.g., does it involve just new HTTP sessions, or does it involve an executable?). Only then can we safely exclude common behaviors without incurring false negatives (FNs). This process can be time-consuming, which is why we intend to leverage deep learning techniques to efficiently bypass it.

#### B. A More Flexible Detection Critic

The anomaly detection critic in ACOBE is relatively simple. We did not incorporate a more complex critic because we wanted to showcase the fundamental idea: an autoencoder-based anomaly detection approach based on compound behaviors. However, our future work includes developing an advanced detection critic capable of robustly filtering out some benign anomalies. This future critic will consider additional factors, including:

1. **Recent Spike in Anomaly Score**: From Figure 5, we see that the anomaly score rises significantly once abnormal activities occur. Thus, we can examine whether the anomaly score has a recent spike.
2. **Waveform Analysis**: We can also examine whether the abnormal rise demonstrates a particular waveform. Different behavioral changes exhibit different characteristics in the anomaly score. For example, a developer starting a new project may show a bursting rise followed by a long-lasting but smooth decrease, while a cyberattack may show chaotic signals without a consistent decrease. These additional factors could be useful in improving anomaly detection in our future work.

#### C. More Evaluations in Future Work

While Yuan et al. [33] noted that most recent deep learning-based studies use the CERT dataset [15] for evaluation, we are eager to know how well ACOBE performs on different datasets. Additionally, we would like to compare ACOBE with more related work, including but not limited to Log2Vec [16]. However, we were unable to do so at the time of writing this paper due to two main reasons: (1) we lack essential prior knowledge about specific target domains, and (2) we do not have detailed parameters for re-implementation (if not open-sourced). Therefore, we need more time to study different datasets and approaches, and we leave these evaluations for future work.

### VIII. Conclusion

The fundamental limitation of the widely-used anomaly detection methodology is its neglect of the importance of long-term cyber threats and behavioral correlation within a group. To address this, we propose a behavioral representation called the compound behavioral deviation matrix. Using these matrices, we introduce ACOBE, an autoencoder-based anomaly detection system for compromises. Our evaluation and case studies demonstrate that ACOBE not only outperforms prior related work by a large margin in terms of precision and recall but is also practical for discovering realistic cyber threats.
