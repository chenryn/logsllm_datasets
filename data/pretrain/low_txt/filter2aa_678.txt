**WARNING: STATIC CONTENT**

One of the key themes of this presentation is that once data is captured, it remains retrievable indefinitely.

### Abstract

How much data do you generate in a typical day? This talk explores various methods for gathering, storing, and analyzing the data stream that constitutes your life. We will cover current approaches, simple code for data persistence, and the future implications for both the community and businesses. The impact on privacy and security will be significant, so stay vigilant and start tracking and logging everything—someone else may already be doing it for you.
