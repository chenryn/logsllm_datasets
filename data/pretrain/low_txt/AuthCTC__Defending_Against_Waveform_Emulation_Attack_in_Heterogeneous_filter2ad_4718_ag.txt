### Observations
- As the range of available CP lengths increases, the distinguishability of different CP lengths improves, leading to a decrease in the decoding error rate.
- In low SNR conditions, a smaller C value often results in higher decoding accuracy due to fewer potential error cases.
- In high SNR conditions, the number of available CP lengths has minimal impact on decoding accuracy.
- A larger C value is preferable because it allows for more bits to be represented by each symbol pair, increasing the total length of the authorization code and enhancing security.

  - **Transmitter-specific features**: Independent of the channel (e.g., signal encoding).

### PHY Security Schemes in Heterogeneous Environments
- **Keyless Approaches**: Improve secrecy by making eavesdropper’s SINR lower than the receiver’s SINR.
  - Techniques include channel coding, channel adaptation, and artificial noise injection.
- **Key-based Approaches**: Extract random keys from the channel of legitimate parties.
  - Techniques include exploiting channel variation, relays, and subcarriers.

## Conclusion
- **Waveform Emulation Attack (WEA)**: A novel attack in CTC where a WiFi device can eavesdrop on ZigBee communications and emulate ZigBee signals.
- **Defensive Mechanism**: Embeds an authorization code into the preamble of the packet by dynamically changing the CP length. The receiver verifies the code, ensuring only legitimate devices can pass verification.
- **Experimental Results**: Demonstrate the feasibility of WEA and the effectiveness of the proposed defense mechanism.
