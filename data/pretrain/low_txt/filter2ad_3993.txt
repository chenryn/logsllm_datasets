**Introduction:**

Research in software reliability has been active for several decades and has generated a vast body of literature exploring new ideas and system prototypes to test these concepts. Despite this extensive work, only a few research efforts have successfully transitioned into industrial applications. This disconnect is further compounded by the growing demand for quality and dependability in an increasingly computerized world.

**Workshop Overview:**

The Workshop on Applied Software Reliability (WASR) aims to bridge the gap between practitioners and researchers involved in the development of mission-critical, software-intensive systems. The workshop will serve as a platform for detailed exchanges of ideas, techniques, and experiences, with the goal of understanding the industry's trends towards deploying reliable applications and providing feedback on existing and potential approaches.

**Key Research Questions:**

The workshop will focus on addressing the following key research questions:
- What are the reliability requirements of current and future applications?
- What are the significant challenges and risks?
- What are the current approaches used to address reliability issues in industrial applications, and what additional measures are needed?
- What are the promising reliability solutions in the short to mid-term?
- What are the open research problems?

**Call for Participation:**

We welcome and encourage participation from researchers and practitioners in academia, industry, and government. We are soliciting contributions in application areas including, but not limited to:
- Database applications
- Scientific applications
- Telecommunication applications
- Embedded applications
- Space applications
- Internet applications
