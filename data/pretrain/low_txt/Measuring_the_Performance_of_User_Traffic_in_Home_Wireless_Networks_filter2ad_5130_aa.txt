## Abstract

This paper investigates how the performance characteristics of home wireless networks affect the performance of user traffic. Previous studies have either focused on wireless metrics without considering their impact on user traffic or on the performance of home networks at higher layers. In contrast, we deploy a passive measurement tool on commodity access points to correlate wireless performance metrics with TCP performance of user traffic. We implemented our tool and deployed it on 66 homes for one month. Our findings show that most of the time, TCP flows from devices in the home achieve only a small fraction of the available access link throughput. As the throughput of user traffic approaches the access link throughput, the characteristics of the home wireless network more directly affect performance. Additionally, we found that the 5 GHz band generally offers better performance than the 2.4 GHz band, and although device performance varies within the same home, many homes do not experience significant contention.

## 1. Introduction

Home networks increasingly rely on 802.11 wireless communication, with many consumer devices connecting exclusively over wireless. Despite the widespread deployment of home wireless networks, there is limited information about their real-world performance, especially in relation to user traffic and end-to-end performance. Understanding the impact of wireless performance on user experience is crucial as residential access link throughput continues to increase, making the home wireless network a potential bottleneck.

Previous studies have examined wireless network performance in various settings, including conferences, enterprise networks, and apartment complexes. These studies have measured layer-2 performance metrics (e.g., wireless bitrates and retransmissions) and layer-3 performance (e.g., TCP throughput). However, wireless network performance is highly variable, and mapping layer-2 metrics to higher-level metrics like throughput or latency is challenging. Active measurements capture performance at a single point in time and may not reflect the actual performance users experience.

In this paper, we explore the relationship between wireless performance metrics and TCP performance of user traffic. We passively measure wireless performance metrics on user traffic as it passes through the home wireless access point and correlate these metrics with the TCP performance of user traffic. We implement a measurement tool that runs on commodity home wireless access points, allowing for widespread deployment and differentiation between wireless and wide-area performance. The routers used in our study support both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, enabling us to compare their performance. Our deployment on commodity hardware imposes strict design constraints, including resource limitations, a single measurement vantage point per home, and the use of unmodified drivers to avoid interference.

We measured the performance of 66 home networks worldwide, passively collecting data on active TCP connections and wireless statistics such as frame bitrate and retransmissions. Our study confirms previous findings and reveals new insights:
- As access link capacity increases, wireless performance plays a greater role in TCP throughput.
- Latency inside the home significantly contributes to end-to-end latency.
- The 5 GHz band performs better than the 2.4 GHz band, with lower latency and higher bitrates.
- Within the same home, different devices experience varying wireless performance.
- Simultaneous high traffic volumes from multiple devices are rare in practice.

Understanding the relationship between wireless performance and user traffic performance is essential for improving user experience. Our findings provide a foundation for designing systems to detect and isolate performance issues in home wireless networks.

## 2. Method

### 2.1. Measurements

We developed a passive measurement tool for home access points to collect and correlate user traffic with wireless metrics. Passive measurements more accurately reflect the actual performance users experience and do not introduce additional contention. Our tool operates on commodity access points, facilitating widespread deployment and differentiation between wireless and wide-area performance. However, resource limitations and bandwidth constraints impose design constraints, precluding the use of existing network diagnostic tools.

We collected packet traces from the WAN interface and both wireless interfaces using pcap. Packet traces from the WAN interface provide information about wide-area TCP connections and IP packets. The wireless interfaces were configured in monitor mode to capture radiotap headers, which include source and destination MAC addresses, received signal strength (RSSI), and frame control bits (bitrate and retransmission status).

**Deployment:**
- We deployed our measurements on BISmark, using Netgear’s WNDR 3700/3800 access points.
- These devices have an Atheros chipset with a 450 MHz processor, one 802.11gn radio, and one 802.11an radio.
- The 3800 has 128 MB of RAM, and the 3700 has 64 MB of RAM.
- The devices run OpenWrt with the ath9k wireless driver, using the Minstrel rate adaptation algorithm with a maximum bitrate of 130 Mbps.
- To respect user privacy, we did not collect payloads and anonymized all IP and MAC addresses using SHA-256 and a per-access point secret salt.
- We collected data from 66 homes in 15 countries for one month in 2013.

**Limitations:**
- Continuous data collection from multiple interfaces on a commodity access point imposes significant CPU and data requirements. Thus, the router collects data every five minutes for 15 seconds per iteration, exporting only flow summaries.
- Anonymization of device MACs and IP addresses limits fine-grained analysis of application flows and device-specific issues.
- We have a single vantage point for measurements, as most homes have only one access point.
- Driver limitations prevented scanning for nearby access points, as scanning caused persistent disconnections for some users.

### 2.2. Metrics

We extracted both TCP-level and wireless performance metrics from the passive traffic traces.

**TCP Performance Metrics:**
- The access point runs tcptrace to process pcap traces and provide TCP statistics.
- We studied the average download TCP throughput achieved during the captured lifetime of the flow.
- We computed the aggregate throughput at every one-second interval by summing the average throughput of all active flows.
- For reference, we compared the aggregate throughput with the access link capacity, measured using BISmark’s active measurements.
- We also studied the round-trip time (RTT) of TCP connections, computed as the difference between the time of the data and SYN packets and their corresponding acknowledgments.

**Wireless Performance Metrics:**
- We used bitrate, retransmission rate, and received signal strength indication (RSSI) as indicators of wireless performance.
- IEEE 802.11 bitrate adaptation techniques adjust the transmission bitrate based on channel conditions. We used the normalized bitrate, which is the average wireless bitrate computed over one-second intervals, normalized by the maximum bitrate supported by the channel.
- We computed the retransmission rate as the fraction of frames with the retransmit bit set in any given one-second interval.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Correlating TCP and Wireless Performance

We explored the achieved throughput of user traffic and the contributions of the home wireless network to this performance. We also studied RTTs of user traffic and how poor wireless network performance can result in higher LAN RTTs.

**User Traffic Rarely Achieves Full Access-Link Throughput:**
- Figure 2 shows the fraction of time that the sum of TCP throughput for all flows in a home achieves a particular value relative to the access link throughput.
- The results indicate that user traffic rarely saturates the available access link throughput.
- This underutilization may be due to insufficient user demand, short flows, or the presence of wireless bottlenecks in the home network.

**Achieved Throughput Often Correlates with Wireless Performance Metrics:**
- We measured how the aggregate throughput correlates with the bitrate and retransmission rate.
- When considering all traffic flows, TCP throughput does not strongly correlate with wireless performance metrics.
- However, for flows with normalized throughput greater than 0.1, the correlation between wireless metrics and access link throughput is stronger and increases with the access link throughput.
- Figures 3a and 3b show the correlation coefficients between aggregate throughput and retransmission rate, and RSSI, respectively, at different access link throughput levels.

**Round-Trip Latency:**
- Figure 4 shows the round-trip latency of flows, highlighting the significant contribution of wireless performance to end-to-end latency.

Our findings suggest that as access link throughput increases, wireless performance becomes a more critical factor in determining user traffic performance. Understanding this relationship is essential for improving user experience and designing systems to detect and mitigate performance issues in home wireless networks.
