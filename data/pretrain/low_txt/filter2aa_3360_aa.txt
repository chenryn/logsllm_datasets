## VoIP Telephony
- **Signaling + Media**

### Signaling Protocols
- **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)**
  - Developed by the IETF
  - Replaces traditional desk phones and PSTN
- **H.323**
  - Created by the ITU-T
  - Primarily for videoconferencing but also used for voice calls
- **SCCP (Skinny)**
  - Cisco proprietary protocol for line-side control of phones

### Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
- **Text-based protocol**
- **Applications**
  - Audio and video calls using RTP
  - Text messages using the SIP "Message" method
- **Works with other protocols**
  - SDP (Session Description Protocol) for media negotiation and setup
  - Can operate over TCP, UDP, or SCTP
  - Security provided by TLS (SIP over TLS)

### SIP Methods
- **SUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH, and NOTIFY**

### Sample Call Flow
- [Diagram or detailed steps]

### User Agent Server (UAS) Solutions
- sipfoundry.org
- freeswitch.org
- elastix.org
- asterisk.org
- 3cx.com

### Softphone Clients
- **Definition**: Software for making telephone calls over IP
- **Options**
  - Zoiper
  - X-Lite
  - LinPhone
  - MicroSIP
- **Factors to Consider**
  - Codec support
  - Encryption capabilities
  - Additional functionalities (text messaging, hold, waiting, etc.)

### Asterisk Now

### Scenario
- [Description of the scenario]

### Possible Configurations
- SIP + RTP
- SIP over TLS + RTP
- SIP + SRTP
- SIP over TLS + SRTP

### SIP/SDP Packets

### SRTP Key in SDP Packet

### SRTP Traffic

### Encrypted Call

### No SIP Traffic
- [Explanation or diagram]

### TLS Traffic (SIP over TLS)
- [Details or diagram]

### No RTP Traffic
- [Explanation or diagram]

### Why No RTP Traffic?
- Wireshark uses SDP packets to determine the port for RTP/SRTP streams.
- If SIP and SDP are encrypted, Wireshark cannot determine the ports.

### Undecoded RTP Traffic

### Decode As RTP
- [Details or diagram]

### Checking RTP Streams
- [Details or diagram]

### Analyzing RTP Streams
- [Details or diagram]

### Playing RTP Streams
- [Details or diagram]

### TLS Key Exchange Methods
- **Symmetric Ciphers**: AES, Blowfish
- **Options**
  - DHE (Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange)
  - RSA (Asymmetric Encryption)

### Diffie-Hellman Exchange
- **Assumption**: An attacker cannot guess the secret color even after seeing the exchanged colors.
- **More Info**: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange

### RSA (Asymmetric Encryption)
- [Details or diagram]

### Observations
- **DHE/ECDHE**: Keys cannot be recovered by listening to traffic.
- **RSA**: If the private key of the server is obtained, traffic can be decrypted.

### Undecoded SRTP Traffic
- [Details or diagram]

### Decode As RTP

### Playing RTP Streams

### Decrypting TLS Traffic
- **RSA Key Exchange**: Used to exchange keys.
- **Decryption**: Requires the private key installed on Asterisk One.
- **Key and Certificate Location**: /etc/asterisk/keys
- **Steps**
  - Obtain the default.key from the server.
  - Edit > Preferences > Protocol > SSL
  - Add the Asterisk default private key.

### Decrypted SIP Traffic
- [Details or diagram]

### SRTP Key in SIP/SDP Decrypted Packet
- [Details or diagram]

### Open Source Tools for Decrypting SRTP
- **SRTP Decrypt**
  - Tool to decipher SRTP packets.
  - Takes a symmetric key to decrypt SRTP traffic.
  - Outputs decrypted packets as a hexdump.
  - Wireshark can reconstruct RTP packets from the hexdump.
- **Libsrtp**

### SRTP Decrypt
- **GitHub**: github.com/gteissier/srtp-decrypt

### SRTP Decrypt: Pre-Installation
- Install libgcrypt
- Install libpcap

### SRTP Decrypt: Installation
- Cloning the repository
- Compiling the code
