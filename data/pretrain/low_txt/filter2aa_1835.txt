### What is Maltego?

- Tons of tutorials and videos available
- Demos rely on:
  - Internet connection
  - Code working
  - Remote APIs functioning
  - No changes in the environment
  - Cross your fingers, toes, and tongues for good luck!

### Footprinting 101

- **Methods:**
  - Domain
  - DNS Name
  - MX
  - Website
  - NS
  - IP Address
  - Netblock
  - AS Number
  - Sharing MX
  - Sharing NS
  - TLD Expand
  - Mirror
  - Resolve IP
  - Reverse DNS
  - Historic DNS
  - DNS Name to Domain
  - Block in Reverse DNS
  - SPF Records
  - Co-hosted on IP
  - Netblock to AS
  - AS to Netblock
  - Expand Netblock to IPs

- **With Code:**
  - Provides:
    - Domains
    - DNS Names
    - IP Addresses
    - Netblocks
    - AS
    - Basic information for targeting

- **Example:**
  - Energy companies in Las Vegas
  - Nevada Energy seems to be the biggest
  - NVEnergy.com footprint :)

- **TL;DR: Maltego is awesome for footprinting.**

### ICS Devices

- **Industrial Control Systems (ICS):**
  - Used to operate/automate industrial processes
  - Examples: Power, Water, Manufacturing, Treatment, etc.
  - Critical systems that should not fail

- **Hacking ICS Devices:**
  - Not the focus of this talk
  - Many resources available (talks, tweets, YouTube)
  - Targeting devices, firewalls, protocols, etc.
  - Usually requires access to the device
  - But what if you need to find it first?

- **ICS Devices on the Internet:**
  - They have networking capabilities
  - Best practice: Keep them in an air-gapped LAN or offline
  - Major Protocols: Modbus, S7, (Niagara) Fox, BACnet
  - Ideally, none should be online

- **Finding ICS Devices on Shodan:**
  - Google Hacking-esque
  - Multiple search strings
  - Example: "port: 9600 response code", "port:2404 asdu address"
  - Results include IP addresses, types (CPU/Model), and locations

- **Hunting ICS Devices:**
  - Find all ICS devices
  - Try to do attribution
  - Is it our target? Yes/No
  - This method is challenging due to the variety of devices/types
  - None say "NVEnergy main powerplant"

- **Hunting ICS Devices with Maltego and Shodan:**
  - Build a "super transform" to find all types at once
  - Use domain, netblock, and Shodan keywords
  - Feed inputs: Domain/Netblock/IP
  - Sometimes successful, e.g., Princeton.edu, Usc.edu

- **Alternative Inputs:**
  - Geo-location
  - GPS near the target
  - Example: Las Vegas
  - Better results, but manual and lucky

- **Automated Hunting:**
  - Use GEONAMES to find places based on categories (Power, Water, etc.)
  - Demo: Category (e.g., "Power") gives locations and ICS devices for a country
  - Relies on the quality of GEO2IP, which can vary

### Data Breaches

- **Footprinting ICS Devices:**
  - Helps find interesting infrastructure to target
  - What about people who work at interesting places?

- **Data Breaches:**
  - Commonly used for basic audits
  - Determine the number of employees, company cards, etc.
  - Plenty of work already done via blogs, white papers, etc.

- **AshMad (Ashley Madison) Example:**
  - Free Beta at the moment
  - Data sources: Public TDS (free), Local Transforms (free), Import Graph from Table (beer!)
  - Requires: Datasource (MySQL, Splunk, MSSQL, etc.), Query, Mapping

- **Fixing Ashley Madison Dump:**
  - Great for email->profile
  - Challenging for Domain->profiles, IP Address->profiles, Netblock->profiles
  - Interact with it via Domain, Email Address, Alias

- **Breaches for Interesting Targets:**
  - Even if they use these sites from work computers, footprinting becomes super interesting
  - Exit Nodes, Wiki Edits, Breach Data, and the reverse

- **Example: CIA.gov**
  - Verification
  - Profile seems too easy (User/Pass, Profiles, etc.)
  - Honeypot? Could be…

- **Other Breaches:**
  - Leaked databases/mail
  - Confirm footprints
  - More people: Find "interesting" places, use Twitter to search for GPS, and more

### Conclusions

- **ICS Devices:**
  - Difficult to attribute
  - Usually not on the corporate network or visible to the internet
  - Easier to find via GPS, but risks collateral damage

- **Breach Data:**
  - Provides more than user details
  - Private email addresses (outside org) -> other social networks
  - Good for targeting people

- **Exit Nodes:**
  - Good for targeting infrastructure with both internal and external access
