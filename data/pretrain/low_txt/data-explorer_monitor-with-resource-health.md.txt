# Monitor Azure Data Explorer Using Resource Health (Preview)

[Resource Health](/azure/service-health/resource-health-overview) for Azure Data Explorer provides insights into the health of your Azure Data Explorer resources and offers actionable recommendations to help you troubleshoot any issues. The health status is updated every 1-2 minutes, providing both current and historical health information.

Resource Health evaluates the health of your Azure Data Explorer resource by performing various checks, including:
- Resource availability (cluster unavailability for queries)
- Query failures
- Update policy failures
- Low ingestion success rate
- High ingestion latency
- Degraded materialized views
- High latency for data connections (provided the data connection is functional)

## Accessing Resource Health Reporting

To access the Resource Health reporting for your Azure Data Explorer resources, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. From the list of services, select **Monitor**.
1. Navigate to **Service Health** > **Resource health**.
1. In the **Subscription** dropdown, select your subscription. Then, in the **Resource type** dropdown, select **Azure Data Explorer**.
1. The resulting table will list all the resources in the selected subscription, each with a health state icon indicating its current health status.
1. Click on your resource to view its [resource health status](#resource-health-status) and receive troubleshooting recommendations.

## Resource Health Status

The health of a resource is indicated by one of the following statuses: **Available**, **Degraded**, **Unavailable**, or **Unknown**.

### Available

A **Available** status indicates that your Azure Data Explorer resource is healthy and functioning without any issues.

### Degraded

A **Degraded** status indicates that your Azure Data Explorer resource has detected a performance loss or potential data loss, such as a low ingestion success rate. However, the cluster remains available for use.

### Unavailable

An **Unavailable** status indicates that there is an ongoing issue with your Azure Data Explorer resource, causing it to be unavailable for queries and ingestion. For example, nodes in your resource may have unexpectedly rebooted. If your resource remains in this state for an extended period, contact [support]().

> [!TIP]
> You can use the [system information commands](kusto/management/system-info.md) to identify the source of the problem.

### Unknown

An **Unknown** status indicates that Resource Health has not received information about your Azure Data Explorer resource for more than 10 minutes. This status does not definitively indicate the health of your resource but is an important data point in the troubleshooting process. If your resource is functioning as expected, the status should change to **Available** within a few minutes. An **Unknown** health status may suggest that a platform event is affecting the resource.

> [!TIP]
> The Azure Data Explorer cluster resource health will be **Unknown** if the cluster is in a stopped state.

## Historical Information

In the **Resource Health** pane, under **Health history**, you can access up to four weeks of resource health status information. Click the arrow for more details on the health events reported in this pane.
