### 7.1 Extension for Representative Values of the Power α and Request Rates

The simulations confirm the general patterns that were analytically revealed for Poisson arrivals. For each fixed value of α, the observed patterns become more pronounced with higher request rates.

### 7.2 Trace-based Simulations

We conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of our cache under different extension factors and source types. The source simulations follow the methodology outlined in Section 4. To incorporate an extension factor \( r \), our simulated cache computes the freshness lifetime as \( r \) times the calculated value for the respective source type.

Figure 13 illustrates the miss rate for various request rates as a function of the extension factor for different source types. Similar results were obtained for the SD trace (not shown). As predicted by the analysis, the performance curves for auth(r) and ind(r) are smooth, while the exc(r) curve exhibits sharper drops at integral values of \( r \). This behavior is more pronounced at higher request rates. It is also evident that for integral values of \( r \), exc(r) outperforms ind(r), and for some intermediate values, ind(r) outperforms exc(r).

### 7.3 Lessons and Implications

The patterns derived from the Poisson analysis and the Pareto and trace-based simulations provide guidelines for effective use of the extension factor.

**Extension Factor Selection:**
- The selection of the extension factor can vary with the object and over time to balance the degree of incoherence and the cost of cache misses.
- Assume the degree of incoherence is the average value of the extension factor \( r \), and the miss-cost is proportional to the number of misses.
- Given a maximum allowed incoherence, the goal is to select extension factors to minimize the miss-cost.

**Guidelines:**
- **Exclusive (exc) Source:**
  - The miss rate vs. extension trade-off curve for exc(r) implies that across all request rates, integral values of \( r \) provide the best balance between incoherence and miss-rate.
  - A mix of consecutive integral values of the extension factor incurs a lower miss-cost than a non-integral extension factor with the same degree of incoherence. For example, a mix of exc(1) and exc(2) with the same incoherence as exc(1.5) has a lower cost.
  - The benefit of using integral values is more pronounced at higher request rates due to larger performance gaps.

- **Independent (ind) and Authoritative (auth) Sources:**
  - The miss-rate dependence on the extension factor is convex and monotonically decreasing as \( r \) increases.
  - A fixed value of \( r \) would result in a lower miss-rate than a mix of values with the same average degree of incoherence.

### 8. Conclusion

We explored age as a new dimension of cache performance, particularly its impact on cascaded caches. Age complements other cache-performance issues, affecting frequently requested objects even with infinite storage. Surprisingly, age-related performance issues have largely been overlooked. We used analysis and simulations to evaluate age-related performance aspects under various cache configurations and behaviors, including extended object-lifetime durations at client caches, sporadic pre-term refreshes, and rejuvenation at high-level caches.

To focus on age issues, our analysis excluded well-studied and better-understood performance facets, such as misses incurred at higher-level caches. Future work should explore trade-offs between various performance facets and their combined behavior.
