**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Protected User Data

Adversaries may leverage standard operating system APIs to access and collect data from permission-protected data stores on a device, such as the calendar or contact list. To do this, applications must declare the necessary permissions in advance. On Android, these permissions must be specified in the application’s manifest file. On iOS, they must be included in the application’s `Info.plist` file.

This technique allows adversaries to gather sensitive information that is typically protected by the operating system's permission model, which requires user consent for access.
