### Mobile Telephony Fraud in China

Mobile telephony fraud is a significant issue in China. The Ministry of Public Security reported that over 400,000 users were victims of telephony abuse in 2014, resulting in a loss of 10.7 billion RMB (approximately 1.67 billion USD) [28].

### Regulatory Challenges in Call Recording

Call recording is regulated in many countries, which complicates the ability to conduct similar studies. In the United States, for example, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires one-party consent in most states, with exceptions like California [3]. However, in China, there are no specific laws governing call recording.

### Seeding Techniques for Honeycards

#### 1. Social Networks
We identified popular social networking websites in China that are likely to be monitored by cybercriminals. We advertised our honeycards on three major platforms: Weibo (a micro-blogging site), Youku (a video streaming site), and Baidu Space (a discussion forum). For instance, on Weibo, we posted messages about a "change of number" using popular hashtags. On Youku, we used a script to automatically comment on popular videos, which had been viewed over 5 million times [5].

#### 2. Mobile Malware
The widespread use of smartphones has led to an increase in mobile malware, particularly on Android platforms. According to a recent report, almost 800,000 new mobile malware samples are observed per quarter, with over 6 million known samples, 10% of which originate from Asia, including China [24]. A study of 1,200 Android malware apps found that more than 50% steal personal information such as phone numbers and contacts [36].

Our second seeding technique involved running mobile malware on a testing device configured with honeycards in the contact list. We tracked the leakage of contact lists using two methods: configuring the handset with the TaintDroid analysis framework [15] and collecting network traffic generated by the malware, such as connections to Command and Control (C&C) servers.

We obtained 369 unique samples of malicious Android applications (from 60 families) from Trend Micro. Half of these samples were trojanized versions of legitimate software, while the other half were standalone malicious applications offering fake messaging, free wallpapers, ringtones, games, and sexual content. Each malware sample was run on a Nexus 4 running Android 4.3 for 5 minutes with manual interactions to trigger possible leakages.

The samples were tested in batches: 220 samples on November 19th and December 2nd, 2014; 140 samples on December 11th, 2014; and 9 samples on February 19th, 2015. The third batch included malware used in an ongoing sextortion campaign [25]. Out of the 369 samples, 248 (67%) executed successfully. By analyzing 438MB of network traffic and TaintDroid alerts, we identified 264 leakages to 140 unique C&C servers, all occurring over HTTP.

#### 3. Abuse Lists
Another method of seeding honeycards involves making calls to numbers listed on suspicious caller websites. We extracted 2,236 unique numbers (1,683 mobile) from Lajidianhua, the largest provider of abuse call lists in China, and contacted them using two honeycards. One honeycard sent an engaging SMS message, and the other made a one-ring call. The SMS message read: "I am fine with our discussion. How do we proceed?"

### Evaluation

#### 4.1 Unsolicited Calls and SMS Messages
MobiPot was deployed in China from August 22nd, 2014, to March 27th, 2015, to understand the ecosystem behind unsolicited SMS messages and calls. We collected 1,021 SMS messages from 215 senders and 634 voice calls from 413 callers. We also received 66 MMS messages, which were not supported by the GSM-VoIP gateway and thus ignored.

To filter out noise, we transcribed all calls using Wanbo Steno [33] and translated SMS and call content into English using Google Translate. We then clustered the SMS messages and calls using a hierarchical clustering algorithm with Levenshtein distance and Dunn index. URLs in SMS messages were classified using Trend Micro's web-reputation service. All SMS messages containing malicious URLs were labeled as unsolicited. The remaining calls and SMS messages were manually classified by two researchers.

Using this approach, we classified 847 (82.95%) SMS messages and 366 (57.73%) calls as unsolicited. There were 215 sources who sent messages to at least one of the honeycards.

#### 4.2 Volume and Temporal Characteristics
Figure 2 shows the diurnal volume of both benign and unsolicited SMS messages and calls. MobiPot received more unsolicited calls and SMS messages on almost all days. On average, we collected 3.88 unsolicited SMS messages and 1.68 unsolicited calls per day. There was an increase in daily SMS message volume from December 2014 onward, coinciding with our seeding exercises.

Interestingly, the volume of benign SMS messages and calls was very high on two occasions, much higher than unsolicited ones. These sharp increases coincided with the dates of our seeding, especially with the two honeycards seeded with abuse lists (abs1 and abs2). This suggests that a large portion of the numbers on the abuse lists are actually benign.

Figures 2(c) and 2(d) show the hourly distribution of calls and SMS messages, with most traffic occurring during business hours. This confirms the findings that most attack sources blend in with normal telephony traffic to appear legitimate [13].

#### 4.3 Honeycards
Table 2 provides a breakdown of the SMS messages and calls received on each honeycard. The likelihood of receiving an unsolicited message was higher than receiving an unsolicited call. For example, all messages received on nsd1, mal1, and mal2 were unsolicited. Excluding abs1 and abs2, 664 out of 679 (97.79%) messages and 241 out of 286 (84%) calls were unsolicited.

During the entire period, soc1 received the highest number of abuse calls and messages (303 out of 317 or 95.58%). Conversely, abs1 received the smallest number of unsolicited calls and messages (49 out of 190 or 25%). The two numbers seeded in the same way showed considerable differences in the messages and calls received.

### Conclusion
This study highlights the effectiveness of different seeding techniques in understanding and combating mobile telephony fraud. Future work will explore additional seeding methods to further enhance the detection and prevention of such fraudulent activities.
