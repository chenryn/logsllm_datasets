# Holey Beep
## Category: PWN

### Description:
We have achieved code execution on the refrigerator, and the `/secret_cake_recipe` file is now within reach. However, Wintermuted's TODO list mentions that the door alarm on the fridge is continuously sounding, which is a typical indicator of the Holey Beep vulnerability. This might be our chance to escalate our privileges to root. The scent of success (and metaphorical cake) is in the air.

### Solution:
This challenge is a direct continuation from the previous one, [Fridge TODO List](Fridge_TODO_List.md). 

You may wonder, "We already have a shell, so why can't we simply read the `/secret_cake_recipe` file?" Let's try:

```console
$ cat /secret_cake_recipe
cat: /secret_cake_recipe: Permission denied
```

Next, let's check the directory permissions:

```console
$ ls -al /

```

The `secret_cake_recipe` file has restrictive permissions, only allowing the `admin` user to read it. Since we are currently logged in as the `user`, we need to escalate our privileges to `admin`.

Recall from the previous challenge, when searching for the flag, we noticed an additional file in the `user` directory:

```console
$ ls -al
total 52
drwxr-xr-x 3 user   user     4096 Oct 24 19:04 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 nobody nogroup  4096 Oct 24 19:04 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 user   user      220 Aug 31  2015 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 user   user     3771 Aug 31  2015 .bashrc
-rw-r--r-- 1 user   user      655 May 16  2017 .profile
```

To proceed, we need to find a way to exploit the Holey Beep vulnerability and gain `admin` privileges. This will allow us to read the `secret_cake_recipe` file.
