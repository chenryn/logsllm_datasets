### Identification and Classification Activities

Identification and classification activities involve assigning new titles to an existing methodology. Any new requirements can be added to the already effective security plan.

### 4.4.2.1. Electronic Security Perimeters (ESPs)

ESPs are used to segment the network and are crucial for implementing security controls. All ESPs must be inherently trusted zones. All access points, whether Ethernet, fiber, proprietary, or any other physical or wireless connection, must be identified and protected appropriately. For an effective defense-in-depth approach, ESPs should be defined in a layered or hierarchical manner. Generally, primary, secondary, and tertiary ESPs will suffice.

- **Primary ESP:** This should encompass the entire site, including all ESPs and trusted zones. All physical and wireless connections must be identified and documented. These external connections to the primary ESP are the most critical to protect, as they are typically the only access points available to remote attackers. Access points to the primary ESP require robust protection mechanisms, strong authentication, and encryption.
- **Secondary ESPs:** These are internal access points for various network segments and should never have external connections. All external connections to a secondary ESP should pass through the primary ESP before communicating with the outside world. Connections between secondary ESPs should have robust and effective controls.
- **Tertiary ESPs:** Often overlooked, tertiary ESPs are the last line of defense for cyber devices. They should have the same level of controls and protection as secondary ESPs, but tailored to each individual ESP. All high-risk critical cyber devices should be included in a tertiary ESP. This layered approach facilitates the isolation of one ESP from another during a compromise.

### 4.4.2.2. Protection of ESP Access Points

Defense-in-depth is a layered security strategy aimed at strengthening security controls at all levels. It originated as a military strategy to delay, rather than prevent, an attacker's advance by yielding space to buy time for an effective response. An effective defense-in-depth strategy results in either an attack attempt of infeasible duration or an attack duration that buys enough time to detect and respond. Varying the use of tools and vendors across levels makes the network more resistant to compromise.

- **A. Limiting access to the Primary ESP via the DMZ:**
  - The DMZ limits and controls all communication between trusted and untrusted zones. Any device connecting to an untrusted zone must be included in the DMZ to maintain its integrity. Devices in the DMZ are classified as Level 1 Critical Cyber Assets, and all connections to the DMZ must have the highest levels of security. Firewalls from two different manufacturers should bridge the trusted and untrusted zones to prevent a single vulnerability from compromising the system. Ideally, there should be only one connection between the DMZ and the untrusted zone, and one between the DMZ and the trusted zone. If unidirectional communication is sufficient, a data diode can be installed. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) may also be effective within the DMZ. Internet access should not be permitted directly through the DMZ, an ESP, or a trusted zone. All Internet Protocol Suite (e.g., TCP/IP) traffic should be routed through a stateful firewall.
  
- **B. Limiting access between Secondary ESPs:**
  - Secondary ESPs should only communicate with other secondary ESPs or access points to the primary ESP. Access to any secondary ESP through any access point should be permitted only through a well-managed and stateful firewall. Log all access events and continuously monitor, detect, and alarm unauthorized access attempts. Consider recording user activity and providing session lock for inactive users. Protect both redundant and primary connections. All Level 1, 2, and 3 devices should be housed in secondary or tertiary ESPs.
  
- **C. Limiting access between Devices and/or Tertiary ESPs:**
  - Tertiary ESPs should be defined for the highest-risk cyber devices and tailored to each system.

- **D. Domain Controllers, Active Directory, and Group Policy Objects (GPOs):**
  - While a detailed discussion of domain controllers, active directory, and GPOs is beyond the scope of this paper, they are highly recommended for ease and cost savings in security and user management. NIST Special Publication 800-81, “Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide,” is a recommended guide for installing domains at enterprise facilities.

### 4.4.2.3. Protection of Cyber Devices

When determining how to protect cyber devices, classifications play a key role if designed and implemented correctly. Over-fragmenting policies or over-applying too few policies are common mistakes. The classifications outlined in Section 4.4.1 are intended for large industrial facilities. When applying security controls, use a layered approach but maintain some continuity at each layer, unless excessively strong protection mechanisms are required, such as in the DMZ.

- **A. Applying protections to devices:**
  - The protections applied to various components in an industrial control system will vary depending on factors such as risk and criticality. The following guidance provides minimum requirements for applying controls to devices. Each hardening subject matter is discussed in detail in Section 4.4.2.3 B.

  - **PCs/Servers:**
    - Standardize on one operating system for a given plant when possible.
    - Surface area reduction via baseline hardening (Level 1, 2, and 3 devices)
    - Surface area reduction via device-specific hardening (Level 1 and 2 devices and certain Level 3 devices)
    - Configuration and security settings (Level 1, 2, and 3 devices)
    - Protection software (Level 1 and 2 devices, and Level 3 devices where applicable)
    - Communications and Data hardening (Level 1, 2, and 3 devices)
    - Maintenance and hardware hardening (All device levels)
    - Physical security hardening (Level 1, 2, and 3 devices)

  - **Network Switches:**
    - Use managed switches; unmanaged switches, hubs, and routers have limited security capabilities and should be avoided.
    - Surface area reduction via baseline hardening (Level 1, 2, and 3 devices)
    - Surface area reduction via device-specific hardening (Level 1 and 2 and some Level 3 devices)
    - Configuration and security settings (Level 1, 2, and certain Level 3 devices)
    - Protection software (Level 1 and 2 devices)
    - Communications and Data hardening (Level 1, 2, and 3 devices)
    - Maintenance and hardware hardening (All device levels)
    - Physical security hardening (Level 1, 2, and 3 devices)

  - **Printers:**
    - Modern printers often come with operating systems, storage, and Ethernet capabilities, making them vulnerable. Apply the following controls whenever feasible:
    - Surface area reduction via baseline hardening
    - Surface area reduction via device-specific hardening
    - Configuration and security settings (All device levels)
    - Protection software (Not directly applicable)
    - Communications and Data hardening (Level 1, 2, and 3 devices)
    - Maintenance and hardware hardening (Whenever feasible)
    - Physical security hardening (Whenever feasible on Level 1 and 2 devices)

  - **PLCs:**
    - Many modern and all obsolete PLCs were not designed with security in mind. A dedicated add-on security device, such as the Tofino Security Appliance, is usually required.
    - Surface area reduction via baseline hardening (Level 1, 2, and 3 devices)
    - Surface area reduction via device-specific hardening (Level 1 and 2 devices)
    - Configuration and security settings (All device levels)
    - Protection software (Usually not directly applicable, but implement when feasible)
    - Communications and Data hardening (Level 1 and 2 devices)
    - Maintenance and hardware hardening (All device levels)
    - Physical security hardening (All device levels)

  - **DCSs:**
    - Until recently, DCSs did not account for much in terms of security. Modern DCS manufacturers claim to have built-in "compliance" toolsets, which may be useful. Applying security controls to a DCS may be difficult depending on the age of the device, and third-party hardware may be required.
    - Surface area reduction via baseline hardening (Level 1, 2, and 3 devices)
    - Surface area reduction via device-specific hardening (Level 1, 2, and 3 devices)
    - Protection software (Level 1 and 2 devices when feasible, third-party devices required on older systems)
    - Communications and Data hardening (Level 1, 2, and 3 devices)
    - Maintenance and hardware hardening (All device levels)
    - Physical security hardening (All device levels)

  - **Recorders, Relays, and similar Ethernet devices:**
    - Security, both physical and electronic, is limited for these devices, though controls are often mandated by governance. If it is infeasible to implement the following controls, consider using third-party tools or disabling the Ethernet capabilities of these devices until a solution is marketed.
    - Surface area reduction via baseline hardening (Port closing only when feasible across Levels 1, 2, and 3)
    - Surface area reduction via device-specific hardening (Port closing only when feasible across Level 1, 2, and 3 devices)
    - Protection software (Level 1 and 2 devices when feasible using third-party hardware)
    - Communications and Data hardening (Level 1, 2, and 3 devices)
    - Maintenance and hardware hardening (All device levels when feasible)
    - Physical security hardening (All device levels when feasible)

  - **Devices used for access control and/or monitoring of ESPs & PSPs:**
    - These devices deserve strong protection mechanisms. If an attacker gains control over such a device, they can usually gain control over all communications running through it.
    - Surface area reduction via baseline hardening (All device levels)
    - Surface area reduction via device-specific hardening (All device levels)
    - Protection software (All device levels)
    - Communications and Data hardening (All device levels)
    - Maintenance and hardware hardening (All device levels)
    - Physical security hardening (All device levels)

- **B. Hardening:**
  - The goal of hardening efforts is to ensure that only the necessary ports, programs, and services are enabled, to meet security policies, and to add or strengthen security mechanisms. This section is written from the standpoint of hardening computers, but many requirements can be applied to other devices as appropriate.
  - A full hardening process should only be required once for a single cyber device, unless major changes occur. Security policies should be sufficient to maintain the hardened status of an unchanged device.
  - Hardening should be done using a systematic and software-assisted technique. The first step involves developing, implementing, and testing baseline hardening policies. The second step involves hardening each specific cyber device against developed and tested device-specific hardening policies.
  - Extreme care must be taken during hardening to avoid significant adverse effects, such as loss of functionality. Hardening should not affect normal or emergency functionality. Configuration data about the devices being hardened must be obtained before hardening the device. Attempting to harden cyber assets without complete and accurate information can result in dangerous situations, especially when hardening devices associated with a running unit.
  - Software that uses databases and configuration and vulnerability scanners can provide a partly automated solution for managing configuration data.

- **Security, Configuration, and Asset Management:**
  - There are two effective tools for managing security and configuration data in an automated fashion: Microsoft’s Management Console (MMC) in an active directory and domain environment, and Enterprise Configuration Manager (ECM), which also requires a domain. ECM provides additional tools and graphics above and beyond MMC. Asset management is inherent in the software, though attention needs to be paid to the disposal or redeployment of unused hardware.
  - Patch management and virus signature file updates should be built into the software. The system should perform assessments of security vulnerabilities, audits against governing or custom standards, and remotely initiated maintenance activities.
  - Best practices include keeping records of device configurations indefinitely on electronic media, stored by date, managed, and well-protected to provide evidence for auditors. New cyber devices must be hardened before they hit the network or are scanned for configuration data. Every change must be tested in a lab, then implemented, and then tested in the field. Rollbacks and backups should be performed as needed.
  - Tools for auditing a computer include Winaudit, Nmap, Zenmap, Nessus, HP Discovery, and others. Network scans performed during an outage are the preferred method of obtaining data, though systems can be programmed to gather data slowly and non-invasively during operation. The level of data gathered is directly related to the level of privileges of the user’s account.
