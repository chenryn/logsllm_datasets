### Types of Profiling [18]

In this scenario, since each application has a dedicated circuit, the timeout period for each circuit can be extended from the current 10 minutes. This adjustment aims to minimize the impact of additional circuits on the overall architecture, as the 10-minute timeout was initially set to prevent profiling attacks.

### Incorporating Future Path Constraints

Several proposals have suggested incorporating more constraints into the Tor path selection protocol. For instance, it has been proposed that relays should be chosen to minimize the risk of end-to-end timing analysis attacks [11, 27]. Additionally, Sherr et al. [40] suggested enabling applications to select relays based on various performance constraints, such as node-based, link-based, and end-to-end path-based selections. PIR-Tor can integrate these ideas by ensuring that each block fetched from the database contains multiple descriptors, allowing clients to apply similar algorithms to choose the descriptor that best fits their constraints.

### Preserving the Option to Download a Global View

Many use cases, such as those involving researchers or developers working to enhance the security and performance of the Tor network, may require a global view of the system. Therefore, we propose that directory servers also support an option to download the full database.

### Limitations

The Tor network relies on volunteer nodes that contribute their bandwidth for anonymous communication. Our proposal essentially trades off bandwidth for computation at the directory servers, requiring them to volunteer some extra computational resources. Our performance evaluation shows that only a small fraction of CPU resources need to be volunteered by the designated directory servers, especially in the case of ITPIR-Tor. We believe that PIR-Tor offers a good tradeoff between bandwidth and computational resources, resulting in an overall reduction in resource consumption at volunteer nodes.

Secondly, our design is not as scalable as alternate peer-to-peer approaches, which can scale to tens of millions of relays. However, our design provides improved security properties over prior work. Specifically, reasonable parameters of PIR-Tor provide equivalent security to the Tor network. The security of our architecture primarily depends on the well-understood and relatively easy-to-analyze security of PIR schemes, unlike peer-to-peer designs that require analyzing extremely complex and dynamic systems. The only exception is the scenario of CPIR-Tor with descriptor reuse, where the security analysis is more complex.

Moreover, for all scaling scenarios, the communication overhead in our architecture is at least an order of magnitude smaller than that of Tor. Finally, PIR-Tor assumes the use of a small set of standard exit policies for nodes, though a few outliers can be tolerated by downloading their information in full.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we presented PIR-Tor, an architecture for the Tor network where clients do not need to maintain a global view of the system. Instead, they leverage private information retrieval techniques to protect their privacy from compromised directory servers. Our evaluation shows that PIR-Tor reduces the communication overhead of the Tor network by at least an order of magnitude. We analyzed two versions of our architecture: one based on computational PIR and the other on information-theoretic PIR. In computational PIR, clients fetch only a few blocks from the PIR database and reuse blocks to build additional circuits. While this modification has no impact on client anonymity, it slightly weakens the unlinkability of circuits. In contrast, in information-theoretic PIR, clients perform a PIR query per circuit creation and do not reuse blocks, achieving a level of security equivalent to the Tor network. Information-theoretic PIR requires all guard relays to be directory servers, whereas computational PIR is more easily integrated into the current Tor network.
