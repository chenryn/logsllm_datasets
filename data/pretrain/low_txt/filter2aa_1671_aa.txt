## Current Threats and Attacker Skills

### General Assumptions:
- VoIP networks are isolated.
- Hacking VoIP requires detailed knowledge.
- Attacks target only privacy and toll fraud.
- VoIP services are well-configured.

### Real-Life Scenarios:
- Broken physical security and weak network authentication.
- Tools like Viproy make hacking easier, requiring less knowledge.
- Client attacks, intelligence gathering, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).
- Default passwords and obsolete systems.

## Plan & Goals

### Plan
- Identify network design issues
- Unauthorized access to the Voice LAN/WAN
- Attack network services
- Achieve persistent access

### Goals
- Persistent unauthorized network access
- Mass compromise of clients and services
- Eavesdropping

---

## A Recipe for Network Attacks
- **Discover VoIP Network Configuration, Design, and Requirements**
- **Find Voice VLAN and Gain Access**
- **Gain Access Using PC Port on IP Phone**
- **Understand Switching Security**
  - Main vendor for VoIP infrastructure
  - Network authentication requirements
  - VLAN ID and requirements
  - IP phone management services
  - Persistent access

---

## Understanding the VoIP Service

### Client Types
- Soft phones (e.g., IP Communicator, Android/iOS Apps)
- IP phones and handsets (e.g., Cisco 7945, Yealink)
- Video conference equipment (e.g., Cisco Presence)
- External meeting services (e.g., Webex, GoMeeting)

### Service Purpose
- International/National landline/cell endpoints
- Call center (commercial vs. open source)
- Commercial VoIP services (mobile, hosted)
- Internal usage (VLAN, conference rooms)

### VoIP Protocols
- Skinny, SIP, RTP, IAX, H.323

---

## LAN and WAN Design for VoIP

### Local Area Network
- Voice VLAN usage (protected, authenticated)
- Network segmentation (computers vs. VoIP)
- Supportive services (CDP, DHCP, TFTP, HTTP, SNMP)

### Wide Area Network
- Connection types (routers, VPNs, landline)
- Bottlenecks vs. QoS requirements
- Service trusts and trunk usage
- Primary concerns for commercial services (service contingency, DoS targets)

---

## Getting Physical Access to the LAN

### Local Distribution Rooms and Infrastructure
- Network termination and endpoint facilities
- Meeting room and lobby phones, conference devices, emergency phones
- PC ports, Power Over Ethernet (PoE)
- Raspberry Pi for permanent access with 4G

---

## LAN Discovery for Voice VLAN

### Attack Types
- **PC Ports of IP Phones and Handsets**
- **CDP Sniffing/Spoofing for Voice VLAN**
- **DTP and VLAN Trunking Protocol Attacks**
- **ARP Spoofing for MITM Attacks**
- **HSRP Spoofing for MITM Attacks**
- **DHCP Spoofing & Snooping**
- **Persistent Access**
  - Tapberry Pi (a.k.a. berry-tap)
  - Tampered phone + PoE
  - 3G/4G for connectivity

---

## Getting Access Using PC Port
- **IP Phones Have a PC Port for Desktop Usage**
  - No need for CDP spoofing, VLAN setting, or DTP spoofing
  - Authentication of IP Phones (802.1x using hub to bypass, EAP-MD5 dictionary attack)

---

## How to Make Your Own Tapberry Pi
- **RJ45 Connection Pins**
- **Speaker Power**
- **Patch the Cat5 Cable**

---

## CDP Sniffing and Spoofing
