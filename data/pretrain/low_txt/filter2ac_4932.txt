**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Cobalt Group

The Cobalt Group has conducted spearphishing campaigns by sending emails with various attachment types to both corporate and personal email accounts of targeted organizations. These attachments have included:

- **.rtf** (Rich Text Format) files
- **.doc** (Microsoft Word) documents
- **.xls** (Microsoft Excel) spreadsheets
- Archives containing **.lnk** (Windows Shortcut) files
- Password-protected archives containing **.exe** (Executable) and **.scr** (Screen Saver) files

These tactics are designed to trick recipients into opening the attachments, thereby enabling the group to compromise their systems. [58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65]
