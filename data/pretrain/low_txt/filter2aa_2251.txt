## What Happens When You Use Nmap or a Fuzzer on an ICS?
If ICS are so vulnerable, why haven't we seen more attacks? The answer is simple: We aren't looking! 

### Two Key Reasons
1. **Intent**
2. **Visibility**

#### Intent
- **Very little ICS-targeted attack data**
  - Examples: Maroochy Shire to Stuxnet to German Steel Plant
- **Targeted Attacks: Who, Not What**
  - Professional, organized, and well-funded
  - If you kick them out, they will return

#### Visibility
- **Public ICS Vulnerabilities Per Year**
- **Consequences of ICS Hacking**
  - Disruption of critical services (e.g., water, electricity)
  - Increased government security regulations
  - ICS security still lagging behind
  - Breaches are inevitable
  - Attacks are not stopping; every sector, including ICS, is at risk

## Getting Ahead of the Threat: Network Security Monitoring (NSM)
**Definition:**
"The collection, analysis, and escalation of indications and warnings to detect and respond to intrusions. NSM is a way to find intruders on your network and take action before they damage your enterprise."
- *The Practice of Network Security Monitoring*

### History of NSM
- **Invented in 1990, still in use today**
  - **Cliff Stoll** - "Stalking the Wily Hacker" (1988)
  - **Todd Heberlein et al.** - "A Network Security Monitor" (1990)
  - **US Air Force Defense Information Systems Agency** and **Lawrence Livermore National Lab** (Early 1990s)
  - **NetRanger, RealSecure, Snort, and others** (Late 1990s - early 2000s)
  - **Formal definition of NSM** (2002)

### Prerequisites for NSM
- At least one person to watch and hunt
- The right tools to collect and analyze data

### The NSM Cycle
1. **Collection**
2. **Detection**
3. **Analysis**
   - Model for action based on network-derived data
   - Requires people and process, not just technology
   - Focuses on the adversary, not the vulnerability

### Methods of Monitoring
- **Network Tap**: Physical device that relays a copy of packets to an NSM sensor.
- **SPAN or Mirrored Ports**: Switch configuration that sends copies of packets to a separate port where an NSM sensor can connect.
- **Host NIC**: Configured to monitor all network traffic on its segment.
- **Serial Port Tap**: Physical device that relays serial traffic to another port, often requiring additional software to interpret the data.

### Types of Data Collected
- **Full Content Data**: Unfiltered collection of packets.
- **Extracted Content**: Data streams, files, Web pages, etc.
- **Session Data**: Conversation between nodes.
- **Transaction Data**: Requests and replies between nodes.
- **Statistical Data**: Description of traffic, such as protocol and volume.
- **Metadata**: Aspects of data, e.g., IP address ownership.
- **Alert/Log Data**: Triggers from IDS tools, tracking user logins, etc.

### Challenges for NSM
- Encrypted networks
- Widespread NAT
- Devices moving between network segments
- Extreme traffic volume
- Privacy concerns

### Example ICS Architecture
- **Enterprise/IT**
- **DMZ**
- **Plant Control**
- **Web**
- **Historian or other DB**
- **DCS**
- **HMI**
- **PLCs, Controllers, RTUs, PACs**

### Anatomy of an Attack
- **Over half of victim computers have malware**.
- **Attacker Tactics**:
  - Unauthorized use of valid accounts
  - Known and unknown malware
  - Command and control activity
  - Suspicious network traffic
  - Files accessed by attackers
  - Valid programs used for evil purposes
  - Trace evidence and partial files

### Attacker Objectives
- Damage equipment
- Affect or steal process information
- Cause safety or compliance issues
- Pivot from a vulnerable ICS to the enterprise

### Attacker Options
- Gain physical access to an ICS host
- Gain remote access to an ICS host
- Compromise a highly-privileged client machine with access to the ICS network

### Let's Do Some NSM!
- **Inquisitive Mind**
- **NSM Collection Tools**
- **NSM Hunting Tools**
- **Protection**

### NSM Collection
- Firewall logs
- Session data
- NIDS/HIDS logs
- Full packet capture
- Windows logs and syslog
- SNMP (CPU %, etc.)
- Alerts from security agents (AV, whitelisting, etc.)

### What Are We Looking For?
- Exceptions from baseline (e.g., A talks to B but never C)
- "Top Talkers"
- Unexpected connectivity (to the Internet, Business network)
- Known malicious IPs and domains
- Logins using default accounts
- Error messages that could correlate to vulnerabilities
- Unusual system and firewall log entries
- Host-based IDS or other security system alerts
- Unexpected file and firmware updates
- Antivirus alerts

### NSM Detection & "Hunting"
- Analysts look at detected anomalies or alerts and escalate to incident response.
- **Examples**:
  - IDS alerts
  - Anomaly detection
  - Firmware updates and other commands
  - Login with default credentials
  - High CPU or network bandwidth
  - Door alarms when nobody is supposed to be working
  - Devices going offline or behaving strangely

### NSM Analysis
- Incident responders analyze detected anomalies to find malicious activity.
- **Examples**:
  - Application exploitation
  - Third-party connections (e.g., ICCP or vendor access)
  - ICS-specific communication protocol attacks (e.g., Modbus, DNP3, Profinet, EtherNet/IP)
  - Remote access exploitation
  - Direct network access due to poor physical security
  - USB-delivered malware

### ICS NSM Examples
- **Session Data "Top Talkers"**: FlowBAT characterizes session data, showing which nodes have the most traffic.
- **Pcap Analysis for Anomalies**: NetworkMiner can find potential ARP spoofing and other indicators.
- **Pcaps - Abnormal DNS Traffic**: NetworkMiner sees "strange" DNS requests originating from within the ICS.
- **IDS Logs - Abnormal DNS Traffic**: DNS requests shown in the Bro IDS log in ELSA.
- **Pcaps - Malformed Modbus**: Deep packet inspection of Modbus by Wireshark.
- **IDS Logs**: Bro, Snort, and Suricata IDS logs for various protocols.

### NSM Tools for the 7 Data Types
- **Security Onion Linux Distribution**: Easy to install with lots of documentation.
- **Full Packet Capture**: Tcpdump, Wireshark, NetworkMiner
- **Extracted Content**: Xplico, NetworkMiner
- **Session Data**: Bro, FlowBAT
- **Transaction Data**: Bro
- **Statistical Data**: Capinfos, Wireshark
- **Metadata**: ELSA (Whois)
- **Alert Data**: Snort, Suricata, Sguil, Snorby

### Peel Back the Layers of Your Network
- **Security Onion Tools**
- **NetFlow Tools**: SiLK & FlowBAT
- **Installation**: Install on Security Onion with two scripts (www.flowbat.com)
- **Implementation**: Test in a lab first, select suitable hardware, more RAM and bigger hard drives are better, use mirrored/SPAN ports or a good network tap, and place the SO sensor appropriately.

### Takeaways
- You can implement NSM in ICS today without impacting operations.
- Free tools are available to help you start monitoring and hunting for threats.
- People are the most important part of NSM.
- Gigabytes of data and thousands of IDS alerts are useless without interpretation.
- Analyze collected data to understand what's normal and what's not.
- Identify adversary TTPs and act to disrupt them.
- Remember, adversaries are a "Who," not a "What."
