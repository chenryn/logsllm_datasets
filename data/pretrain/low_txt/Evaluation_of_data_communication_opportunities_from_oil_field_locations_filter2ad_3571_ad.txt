### Summary Review Documentation for "Evaluation of Data Communication Opportunities from Oil Field Locations at Remote Areas"

**Authors:** Y. Chen, J. Berg, M. Ammar, E. Zegura

**Reviewer #1**
- **Strengths:**
  - Novel measurement study comparing satellite and cellular links in remote areas.
  - Well-written and interesting to read.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Results are too specific to the locations in the southwest US and cannot be generalized.
- **Comments:**
  - The paper provides an interesting study of cellular and satellite network connectivity at oil field locations.
  - It is difficult to generalize the results, but the trend of expanding cellular infrastructure makes it a compelling alternative to more expensive satellite links.
  - Experimentation should consider job transition and equipment downtime schedules to exclude planned unavailability.
  - Clarify how the results can serve as a basis for future efforts on tuning TCP stack.
  - Table 1 needs units for upload and download bandwidths.
  - Standardize the comparison between absolute and relative increments in signal strength and speed.

**Reviewer #2**
- **Strengths:**
  - Understanding network access in remote/non-urban areas is a new and emerging area.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Findings lack generality or application to other networking problems.
  - Results and techniques are not particularly surprising or interesting.
- **Comments:**
  - The paper could benefit from using measurements to develop new insights or implications for networking, such as hybrid cellular-satellite combinations or DTN.
  - The high availability of cellular networks seems biased by provider coverage and economic considerations, making generalization difficult.

**Reviewer #3**
- **Strengths:**
  - A step in a new environment: building communication networks at lower costs for remote areas and operational deployment of oil companies.
  - Four teams with different schedules and providers are covered.
  - Points to the need for better accommodation of delay in applications and the role of different factors.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - The depth of the problem is not made very precise.
  - Switching to cellular does not significantly impact the DTN area.
  - Cellular networks underperform in terms of raw bandwidth.
  - Unavailability due to hardware being switched off is not factored out.
- **Comments:**
  - The paper is a good fit for a short communication at IMC, providing insights into a new context.
  - Clarify the factors affecting satellite availability and distinguish between hardware and deployment issues.
  - Address unavailability due to non-work periods and power-off times.
  - Compare findings with related work and elaborate on the impact of unavailability.
  - Discuss the unavailability duration of satellite links and the variability of available throughput.
  - Provide a back-of-the-envelope calculation to show the representativeness of the results in other locations.
  - Consider the total volume that can be transported via cellular and satellite networks.

**Reviewer #4**
- **Strengths:**
  - First paper comparing satellite and cellular network performance in remote rural settings.
  - Provides insights into a new aspect of Internet use.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Significant copy editing is needed.
  - Analyses are less rigorous than expected for IMC papers.
- **Comments:**
  - Improve the language and reduce repetition.

### Response from the Authors

1. **Generality of Contributions (Reviewers 1, 2, 3, and 5):**
   - The paper explores the potential for less costly cellular data usage at remote sites where such usage has not traditionally been considered.
   - We aim to provide a framework for assessing availability through systematic measurement and evaluation, applicable to different geographical locations.

2. **Filtering Data Based on Job Transition and Equipment Downtimes (Reviewers 1 and 3):**
   - We retrieved Windows OS native logs containing PC power on/off events from different crews.
   - Reprocessed availability logs to eliminate the effect of job transitions and equipment downtimes, improving the accuracy of the availability comparison.

3. **Optimizing the TCP Stack (Reviewers 1 and 2):**
   - Added end-to-end latency measurements, showing high variation across different interfaces.
   - This indicates that a specially designed TCP stack, which adapts to high latency variation, might perform better than the default TCP stack in a multi-interface system.

4. **Entropy Analysis (Reviewers 3 and 4):**
   - Removed the discussion on entropy analysis as the information presented can be found in other parts of the paper.

5. **Writing and Presentation (Reviewers 4 and 5):**
   - Several rounds of editing were applied to improve the English and presentation.

6. **Clarification of Table 1 (Reviewer 1):**
   - Provided clarification of coverage results in Table 1 and added the unit of measurement.

7. **Hybrid Cellular and Satellite Usage (Reviewer 2):**
   - The methodology developed in this study is used to provide a simple link management scheme, allowing applications to select among interfaces based on availability and preference.

8. **Measurement Location/Crew Selection (Reviewer 4):**
   - Added a discussion on the criteria and process of location/crew selection.

9. **Cellular Link’s Availability (Reviewer 5):**
   - Our objective is not to replace satellite links with cellular links or vice versa.
   - The measurement framework shows that highly-available and cost-effective data communication can be achieved via a multi-interface system.
