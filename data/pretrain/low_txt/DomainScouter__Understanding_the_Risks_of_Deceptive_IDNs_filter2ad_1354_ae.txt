### 7.3 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)

The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is a leading service provider for resolving domain name disputes. From 1999 to 2017, WIPO handled over 73,000 cases and successfully transferred the rights to the rightful owners [65, 66]. Cases filed with WIPO are typically resolved within two months.

The Uniform Rapid Suspension System (URS) [60] complements the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) by providing a quick and cost-effective process for rightsholders to take down squatted domain names. The fees for URS start at approximately $1,000, which is less than the UDRP's starting fee of $1,500 [49]. Identified invalid domain names are suspended by the registry within two to three weeks, but they are not deleted or transferred to the rightsholders.

To counter deceptive Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), domain owners can choose between the UDRP and the URS, considering both the urgency and the monetary costs involved.

### 7.4 Certificate Authorities

Outreach efforts by security engineers, researchers, and browser vendors have led many large websites to serve HTTPS by default. Major browsers, such as Google Chrome, now mark all HTTP sites as "not secure" since July 2018.

Certificate authorities (CAs) should not issue certificates to suspicious domain names to protect end users from deceptive IDNs. However, in practice, many CAs have issued certificates to squatted domain names, including deceptive IDNs [58]. The CA Browser Forum's baseline requirements for issuing and managing publicly trusted certificates [6] state that CAs should perform additional verification for high-risk certificate requests. We recommend that CAs adopt brand-protection policies similar to those followed by domain registrars. If all responsible CAs proactively shared trademark information, similar to the Trademark Clearinghouse (TMCH), they would not issue certificates to squatted domain names. Additionally, CAs could revoke certificates for domain names that violate trademarks upon receiving claims from rightsholders.

Domain owners can explore the certificates of squatted domain names in the log server of certificate transparency [34], as all CAs are now encouraged to submit new certificates to it. Many responsible CAs receive claims from rightsholders.

### 8 Related Work

We summarize related research literature on deceptive IDNs and non-IDN squattings.

#### Deceptive IDNs

Gabrilovich and Gontmakher first mentioned an IDN homograph attack using non-ASCII characters in 2002 [14]. In 2006, Holgers et al. investigated a campus network traffic to find eng-homo IDNs targeting the Alexa top 500 [19]. In 2018, Liu et al. proposed an eng-homo IDN detection method using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between IDNs and brand domains [36]. Sawabe et al. proposed using OCR-based similarities between non-ASCII and ASCII characters [48]. In 2019, Le Pochat et al. explored candidate IDNs that brand owners may want to register [43]. Suzuki et al. developed a framework to identify IDN homographs in an automated manner [53].

While the above studies focused mainly on eng-homo IDNs using a smaller number of IDNs under a limited number of TLDs, our work advances these studies by focusing on various types of deceptive IDNs (e.g., eng-combo, eng-homocombo, noneng-combo, and noneng-homocombo), analyzing more IDNs under almost all TLDs, and studying the extent to which users are deceived by deceptive IDNs.

#### Non-IDN Squattings

In addition to deceptive IDNs, many previous studies have analyzed a wide range of domain squatting methods in non-IDN (ASCII) domains, such as combosquatting (combining brand names with keywords) [30], bit squatting (accidental bit flips) [41], and typosquatting (typographical errors) [1, 29, 55, 62].

### 9 Conclusion

This paper introduces DOMAINSCOUTER, a system designed to detect deceptive internationalized domain names (IDNs) and calculate a deceptive IDN score. Our comprehensive measurement study reveals that (1) there are many previously unexplored deceptive IDNs, (2) their number has been increasing since 2014, and (3) only 3.8% of them are protected by their targeted brand owners. Furthermore, we conducted online surveys to show that most users cannot recognize deceptive IDNs and confirmed that the deceptive IDN score accurately reflects the tendency of users to be deceived.

To reduce the risk of deceptive IDNs, we provide suggestions for client applications, domain registrars/registries, domain owners, and certificate authorities. We hope that our results will contribute to a secure and multilingual Internet for all users.
