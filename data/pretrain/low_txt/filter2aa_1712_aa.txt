### What Constitutes a Difficult Case?

- **Interstitial Web Pages:**
  - Commonly used by travel sites when there is a long delay between a database query and a result set.

- **JavaScript:**
  - When used to dynamically modify forms before submission.
  - AJAX used to populate pages, making "view source" ineffective after the first page of search results.
  - Solved using the online form analyzer: [www.schrenk.com/nostarch/webbots/form_analyzer.php](http://www.schrenk.com/nostarch/webbots/form_analyzer.php)

- **Flash and DHTML:**
  - When used as navigation techniques.
  - Elaborate cookie behavior, including sequence-dependent cookies and strange JavaScript scripts.

- **Randomly Generated Form Element Names:**
  - Handling dynamically generated form elements.

### Fact: We're Still Tied to the Browser

- Sometimes, you can trick a server into delivering simpler data formats by pretending to be a mobile device.
- Often, you need to find a way to emulate browser capability while maintaining full control.

This structured and organized format should make the presentation more clear, coherent, and professional.
