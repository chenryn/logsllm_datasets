### Competition: XLANG and DAML-S

Two notable competitors in the domain of workflow and business process specification are XLANG, developed by Microsoft (Thatte 2001), and DAML-S, a project from DARPA (DAML-S 2001). Specifically, DAML-S includes constructs for specifying Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as quality guarantees, quality ratings, and degrees of quality. While DAML-S has identified the specification of web services and business processes as a key component, the QoS model it adopts requires significant improvement to provide a more comprehensive solution.

### Maintainability

The QoS model presented in this paper can be extended in two additional dimensions, which are particularly useful for Service-Oriented Middleware (SoM) applications with stringent requirements. The first dimension is maintainability, which refers to the mean time necessary to repair failures and ensure that applications can perform their intended functions. Maintenance actions primarily involve correcting errors during application execution. SoM infrastructures record the time required to repair faulty nodes, which varies depending on the type of error. To enhance maintainability, advanced mechanisms have been developed to allow workflow infrastructures to automatically recover from errors. For example, Luo et al. (2000) describe an exception-handling mechanism that detects and propagates exceptions to an exception-handling module, which uses case-based reasoning to derive solutions and adapt over time.

### Security

The second dimension is security, which is crucial for workflow systems coordinating and managing web services. This necessitates the development of techniques to assess the global security level of application specifications and the trustworthiness of the overall application outcome. Applications face several security challenges, including the distributed nature of SoM, the use of non-secure networks like the Internet, the reliance on web servers for accessing SoM data, and the potential involvement of multiple organizations. System security is evaluated based on the presence of security mechanisms (e.g., authentication, access control, audits) and the use of secure development techniques (e.g., formal specifications, tests).

We have extended workflow technology by implementing two security modules. The first, described by Miller, Fan et al. (1999) and Fan (1999), targets the five security services recommended by the International Standards Organization: authentication, access control, data confidentiality, data integrity, and non-repudiation. The second, detailed by Kang, Froscher et al. (1999), describes a multilevel secure (MLS) workflow system that enables distributed users and applications to collaborate across different classification levels, allowing for the programming of multilevel mission logic and the secure coordination of distributed tasks.
