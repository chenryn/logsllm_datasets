# Liveness and Longevity of Phishing Pages

## Table 13: The Liveness of Phishing Pages on Different Dates
Phishing URLs were collected from a large number of organizations worldwide. Through collaboration, we obtained 335,246 phishing URLs reported between April 2017 and April 2018. eCrimeX marked 4 squatting phishing domains (0.2%). Collectively, these blacklists detected only 8.4% of the squatting phishing pages, meaning that 91.5% of the phishing domains remained undetected for at least a month. In comparison, a recent study [33] found that phishing pages hosted on compromised web servers typically last less than 10 days before being blacklisted. This suggests that squatting phishing domains are much more difficult to detect.

### Lifetime of Squatting Phishing Pages
We also measured the longevity of phishing pages. For domains classified as phishing in the first snapshot, we continued to crawl their webpages every week for a month. For each snapshot, we re-applied our classifier to their pages to determine if they were still classified as phishing. The results are shown in Figure 17. Most pages (about 80%) remained active after at least a month, with only a small portion going down after 1-2 weeks. This confirms that squatting phishing pages are difficult to detect and take down.

Table 13 presents the liveness of 6 phishing pages impersonating Facebook. An interesting domain is tacebook.ga. In the third snapshot, we found that the webpage under this domain had been replaced with a benign page (manually verified). However, in the fourth snapshot, the phishing page reappeared.

## Discussion

In this paper, we demonstrate a systematic approach to search and detect squatting phishing pages. With deep-level impersonation, squatting phishing domains are not numerous but are likely used for highly targeted attacks. Our results show that 91.6% of squatting phishing pages remain active after at least a month.

### Detecting Squatting Phishing in Practice
Our system, SquatPhi, can be used in two ways. First, any third-party organization can set up a scanner to constantly monitor squatting domains for a broad range of brands to capture squatting phishing domains. Crowdsourcing efforts can speed up the manual verification process. We narrow down the target from hundreds of thousands of squatting domains to several hundred phishing candidates, making them manageable for manual investigation. Second, individual online services can set up their own dedicated scanner to search for squatting phishing pages impersonating their brands. For example, PayPal can monitor newly registered domain names in the DNS to identify PayPal-related squatting domains and classify squatting phishing pages. The classifier can be more accurate if customized for a specific brand. We have open-sourced our tool at https://github.com/SquatPhish to facilitate future research in the community.

In September 2018, we checked PhishTank, eCrimeX, and VirusTotal again. Among the 1,175 verified squatting domains, 1,075 were still online, and only 60 (5.1%) were blacklisted. We then reported the remaining verified phishing websites to Google Safe Browsing (under VirusTotal). Like most blacklists, Google Safe Browsing does not support batch reporting and has strict rate limits and CAPTCHAs to prevent abuse. We had to submit the malicious URLs one by one manually.

### Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, our crawler only sets two profiles for a specific version of iPhone (mobile) and Chrome (web). It is possible that we might have missed phishing pages that perform cloaking, such as those targeting Microsoft Explorer users. Second, our measurement primarily focuses on "popular brands" based on Alexa ranking. Future work could extend the measurement scope to cover web domains of government agencies, military institutions, universities, and hospitals to detect squatting phishing pages targeting important organizations. Third, it is technically difficult to evade a blackbox OCR engine while creating highly deceptive phishing pages (see ยง5.1). Reverse-engineering OCR for adversarial attacks is beyond the scope of this paper. Finally, we did not directly compare our phishing classifier with existing tools such as Cantina [64] and Cantina+ [61], as most existing works did not open-source their tools, and some of their features are too expensive to obtain for large-scale datasets. In this paper, we open-sourced our tool to ensure the reproducibility of the results.

### Squatting Domains Identification
Previous works have studied different types of squatting techniques [21, 50, 58]. For example, More et al. [50] measured typo squatting by generating a list of plausible misspellings of popular domains. Nikiforakis et al. [51] measured bit squatting by generating single-bit flips for valid domains. Holgers et al. [35] characterized homograph squatting through character substitutions. Kinti et al. [40] measured combo squatting by searching domain keywords from DNS records. In this paper, we focus on aggregating and improving existing squatting methods to search for squatting phishing attacks.

### Phishing Webpage Detection
A plethora of research has focused on blacklisting or content-based detection methods. For example, PhishTank [9] leverages crowdsourcing to collect phishing URLs encountered by Internet users. PhishEye [33] proposed using honeypots to monitor live phishing pages. Other detection methods are based on visual similarities [47, 60] or lexical URL properties [23, 26, 45] to detect phishing pages. DeltaPhish [27] detects compromised websites by comparing page structure similarities. Cantina and Cantina+ [61, 64] use keyword frequency and page rank information. Marchal et al. [46] also use keyword frequency in HTML pages. In this paper, we show how today's phishing pages, especially squatting phishing pages, have adopted evasion techniques that render existing detectors ineffective. A recent system, Meerkat [24], uses deep learning models to analyze visual elements in webpages to detect compromised websites. Our approach is different as we use OCR to extract text from screenshots rather than focusing on visual elements. Researchers [20, 29] used OCR to extract keywords and query search engines to match against real sites. However, this design assumes phishing sites are similar/identical to the target sites, which is not necessarily true given the variances introduced by evasion techniques. Instead, we focus on more generic keywords extracted from logos, login forms, and other input fields to model "phishing" attempts, which turns out to be effective.

### Phishing Emails and Hosting Servers
Phishing emails are used to distribute phishing URLs. Attackers can impersonate trusted parties to send phishing emails via email spoofing [36, 37] or email header injection [55]. In addition to registering squatting domains, attackers can also compromise existing web servers to host phishing pages [53].

## Conclusion
In this paper, we performed an extensive measurement on squatting phishing, where the phishing pages impersonate target brands at both the domain and content level. By monitoring 700+ brands and 600K squatting domains for a month, we identified 857 phishing web pages and 908 mobile pages. We show that squatting phishing pages are impersonating trusted entities through various domain squatting techniques. These pages are more likely to adopt evasion techniques and are hard to catch. About 90% of them have evaded the detection of popular blacklists for at least a month.
