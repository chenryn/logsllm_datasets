### 2.1 Accuracy and Privacy Conditions

In the case of the cloaking method, the least accuracy (200 + 2 · 150) m is independent of the value of \( c \). The accuracy solely depends on the difference between \( \text{rad } R \) and \( \text{rad } I \), which in turn depends on the length \( s \) of the side of the region. If this difference is at least \( 2 \cdot s / 2 \), the condition is satisfied with probability 1. Otherwise, there will be some \( x \) for which the condition is not satisfied (i.e., it is satisfied with probability 0).

For our method, the accuracy condition depends on both \( c \) and \( \epsilon \). Specifically, as discussed in the previous section, the condition is satisfied if and only if \( C^{-1}(c) \leq \text{rad } R - \text{rad } I \). Therefore, for a fixed \( c \), the maximum \( \epsilon \) depends on the difference between \( \text{rad } R \) and \( \text{rad } I \), and is determined by the equation \( C^{-1}(c) = \text{rad } R - \text{rad } I \). For the given values of \( \text{rad } I \), \( \text{rad } R \), and \( c \), it turns out that \( \epsilon = 0.016 \).

### 2.2 Comparison of Location Privacy (LP)

We can now compare the LP of the two mechanisms with respect to the three priors mentioned earlier. Figure 13 illustrates the results. As we can see, our mechanism outperforms the cloaking mechanism in all three cases.

For different values of \( \text{rad } I \), the situation remains unchanged: the cloaking method always forces \( \text{rad } R \) to be larger than \( \text{rad } I \) by at least \( 2 \cdot 150 \) m, and \( \epsilon \) only depends on this value. For smaller values of \( c \), the situation changes, becoming more favorable for our method. The cloaking method's accuracy does not depend on \( c \), while \( \epsilon \) decreases (and consequently LP increases) as \( c \) decreases. For a fixed \( r = \text{rad } R - \text{rad } I \), we have \( \epsilon = C^{-1}_r(c) \). This follows from \( r = C^{-1}(c) \) and the fact that \( r \) and \( \epsilon \) are interchangeable in the expression defining \( C_\epsilon(r) \).

### 7. Related Work

Much of the related work has already been discussed in Section 2. Here, we mention additional works that were not previously reported. There are excellent works and surveys [37, 26, 34] that summarize the different threats, methods, and guarantees in the context of location privacy.

**LISA [9]** provides location privacy by preventing an attacker from relating any particular point of interest (POI) to the user’s location. The privacy metric used in this work is \( m \)-unobservability, which ensures that, with high probability, the attacker cannot relate the estimated location to at least \( m \) different POIs in the proximity.

**SpaceTwist [39]** reports a fake location (called the “anchor”) and queries the geolocation system server incrementally for the nearest neighbors of this fake location until the \( k \)-nearest neighbors of the real location are obtained.

In a recent paper [29], it was shown that, due to finite precision and rounding effects of floating-point operations, standard implementations of the Laplacian mechanism result in an irregular distribution, causing the loss of differential privacy. In [18], the study was extended to the planar Laplacian and any kind of finite-precision semantics. The same paper proposes a solution for the truncated version of the planar Laplacian, based on a snapping mechanism, which maintains the level of privacy at the cost of introducing additional noise.

### 8. Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we presented a framework for achieving privacy in location-based applications, taking into account the desired level of protection and the side-information that the attacker might have. The core of our proposal is a new notion of privacy, called geo-indistinguishability, and a method based on a bivariate version of the Laplace function to perturb the actual location. We emphasized the formal treatment of privacy guarantees, providing a rigorous definition of geo-indistinguishability and a mathematical proof that our method satisfies this property. We also showed how geo-indistinguishability relates to the popular notion of differential privacy. Finally, we illustrated the applicability of our method on a POI-retrieval service and compared it with other mechanisms in the literature, demonstrating that it outperforms those which do not depend on the prior.

In the future, we aim to extend our method to cope with more complex applications, possibly involving the sanitization of several (potentially related) locations. One important aspect to consider when generating noise on multiple data points is the fact that their correlation may degrade the level of protection. We aim to devise techniques to control the possible loss of privacy and to allow the composability of our method.
