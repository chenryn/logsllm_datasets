- **The TICP has been disseminated to all participating agencies and updated to include a newly implemented Project 25 (P25) system.**
- **Use of these SOPs was successfully demonstrated during the TICP validation exercise, though law enforcement needs additional command and control training.**

**Recommendation:**
- **Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.**

#### Usage: Advanced Implementation
- **The Atlanta UA has 26 separate radio systems providing communications to first responder and support agencies.**
- **Despite diverse infrastructure, the UA has been successful in using interoperable communications assets in exercises and real-world responses.**
- **Shared systems are used daily for multi-agency communications, and the Atlanta mobile gateway used in the exercise was pre-programmed, noted as a best practice.**

**Recommendation:**
- **Include communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.**

#### Technology Overview
- **The Atlanta UA has 26 separate radio systems covering 9 counties, including the metropolitan Atlanta area.**
- **The UA relies on NEXTEL and SouthernLINC Enhanced Special Mobile Radio commercial systems for wireless voice and data communications.**
- **The City of Atlanta and Fulton County operate separate 800 MHz radio systems but share system keys.**
- **Atlanta operates a Motorola 800 MHz SMARTNET™ Citywide Radio System supporting 18 local, state, and federal agencies.**
- **Regional interoperability is provided by the Motorola P25-compliant, 800 MHz ASTRO 25 system, used exclusively for regional first responders.**
