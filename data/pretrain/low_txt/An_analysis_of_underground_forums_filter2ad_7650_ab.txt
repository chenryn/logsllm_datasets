### 4.1 Degree Analysis
Figure 1 illustrates the degree distributions for the six forums, focusing only on pairs of nodes with reciprocal links. Figure 1(a) indicates that private message exchanges are relatively infrequent on HL, BH, FH, and HS, with fewer than 40% of users participating in more than one such exchange. In contrast, CC and LC show higher levels of engagement, with over 50% of their users linked to at least one other forum member through private messages, and more than 25% involved in at least 10 conversations. This difference can be attributed to the higher volume of business transactions conducted via private messages in these forums.

In terms of public postings, all forums (except HL, which is relatively new) exhibit a comparable number of links, as this is the primary means of communication in forums. CC and LC stand out, with over 50% of their users linked to more than 20 other members through public postings, which is double the amount seen in other forums.

### 4.2 Social Network Growth
Figure 2 depicts the median private messaging social degree for forum users within a 60-day window following their registration. Only reciprocal links are considered in the computation of social degree. For each pair of linked users, we analyzed the time difference between their registration dates and the timestamp of their first private message exchange. HL and BH were excluded from this analysis due to the noise in their data.

For FH and HS, there is little change in the median social degree after the first week. However, for CC and LC, users experience significant growth in their social degrees after the first week, likely due to the high volume of business transactions conducted via private messages. By the end of the first month, the median social degree for CC and LC users is approximately nine, compared to two for FH and HS. The growth rate for the thread social graph follows a similar trend across all forums, with the largest growth occurring in the first several weeks. Despite this, all forums show that members continue to interact with new users via public postings.

### 4.3 User Overlap
To investigate the overlap among forum members, Tables 3 and 4 present the percentage of overlapping email addresses and usernames, respectively, between each pair of forums. HS is the only forum that did not list any email addresses for its registered members. LC and FH share over two thousand email addresses, while LC and CC share 595, representing roughly 7% of the CC membership. This overlap is expected given that both forums focus on the trading of stolen credit cards. Even the newest English-based forum, HL, shares 6 to 33 email addresses with the German forums.

Email addresses are a reliable metric for establishing population overlap, but usernames also provide valuable insights since users often maintain unique public identities to preserve their reputations. All forum pairs have some overlapping usernames, with the German forums (CC, FH, HS, LC) sharing a significant number. For example, over 10% of the usernames on CC are present in all three other German forums. Similarly, over 17% of the usernames on LC appear in both FH and HS.

### 4.4 Group Elevation
Upon joining a forum, users are assigned to a group that reflects their social status. Typically, users start in a pending authorization group, requiring them to complete certain actions (e.g., email confirmation) before gaining full access. Once authorized, they begin in the "newbie" group. After demonstrating sufficient activity, users are elevated to a non-newbie group and advance from there. Figures 3 and 4 show the median activity levels required for users to transition to higher group levels in CC and FH (BH and HL follow a similar pattern to FH). All forums place a strong emphasis on public postings over private messaging, indicating that reputation is built through public engagement. Users with higher standing in the CC forum show a balanced mix of posting and private messaging activities.

### 4.5 User Interaction Analysis
Figure 5 presents the distribution of private message interactions among users' "associates" (i.e., fellow members they are linked with) on LC, which has the highest number of PMs. This analysis aims to determine the extent to which users interact with different individuals. For each user, we computed a distribution of their interactions to understand the diversity of their connections.
