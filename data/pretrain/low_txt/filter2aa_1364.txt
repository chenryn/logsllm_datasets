## Installation and Configuration Best Practices

### Fresh Install
- Always perform a fresh installation and migrate existing data over to the new system.
- Ensure the file system is converted to NTFS for enhanced security.

### Default Security Settings
- Default security settings are not automatically applied. Use the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to manually apply them.

### Upgrading
- Before upgrading, check Windows Update and TechNet for the latest patches and service packs.
- Use HFNETCHK to ensure all necessary updates are installed.

### File Systems
- Decide on the required services before installation.
- Choose between NTFS and FAT, with NTFS being the more secure option.

### Remote Administration
- Determine the type of remote administration software you will use, such as Terminal Server or Vshell SSH & SFTP (available at [www.vandyke.com](http://www.vandyke.com)).

### Services
- Only install essential services. Avoid installing unnecessary ones.
- For COMPAQ installations, ensure TCP/IP is the only protocol in use.
- Implement TCP/IP filtering and, where applicable, use IPSec.
- Use Nmap to scan the server and ensure no unexpected ports are open.

### Network Configuration
- If the server is running IIS, it should never be part of a domain.
- Use a second Ethernet card for remote administration, with only the "Internet Service" on the primary interface.

### Security Templates
- Customize your own security template and apply it consistently across all servers, from Primary Domain Controllers (PDCs) to desktops.

### Password and Event Log Access
- Enforce password complexity and length requirements.
- Ensure event log access is restricted to authorized personnel.
- Define permissions for services and rename the Administrator account.
- Remove or rename files that could be exploited in an attack.
- Create partitions or move directory structures to protect against directory traversal attacks.

### Unnecessary Services
- Evaluate and remove services that are not needed, such as MS TFTP.
- Consider removing Outlook Web Access (OWA) if it is not required.
- Rename CMD.exe to prevent unauthorized use.

### Microsoft Security Alerts
- Stay informed about security alerts by visiting [microsoft.com/technet/security/notify.asp](http://microsoft.com/technet/security/notify.asp).

### Common Sense
- Run only the base services necessary for IIS 4/5:
  - Event Log
  - License Logging Service
  - Windows NTLM Security Support Provider
  - Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service
  - Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation
  - IIS Admin Service
  - MSDTC
  - World Wide Web Publishing Service
  - Protected Storage

### Files to Remove
- Remove sample files and directories that are not needed:
  - C:\inetpub\iissamples
  - C:\inetpub\iissamples\sdk
  - C:\inetpub\AdminScripts
  - C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\msadc\Samples

### Script Mappings
- Remove unnecessary script mappings:
  - .htr, .idc, .stm, .shtml, .shtm, .printer, .ida, .idq, .hta

### Miscellaneous
- Restrict anonymous access by setting the `RestrictAnonymous` registry key to 1:
  - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA`
- Set appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs) for IIS log files, CGI scripts, and other sensitive files.
- Ensure that IIS log files are not publicly readable:
  - `winnt\system32\LogFiles`

### Exchange Server
- Configure Exchange to use outgoing mail authentication to prevent it from becoming an open relay.
- Limit outgoing message size and use sendmail to relay mail to an internal Exchange server.
- Alternatively, install another copy of Exchange with the Internet Mail Connector and add it to the existing site without creating mailboxes or folders.

### Exchange Administrators
- Set up different levels of administrative access:
  - Exchange Administrator
  - Exchange Full Administrator
  - Exchange View Only Administrator
- Enable the security page in the Exchange Administrator by setting the `ShowSecurityPage` value to 1 in the registry:
  - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\ExAdmin`
