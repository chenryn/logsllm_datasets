### Performance of CarSpeak in a Network of Wireless Nodes

CarSpeak outperforms the baseline 802.11 implementation by an average factor of 2.4 in a network with over six robots. This performance is evaluated under varying conditions, where different numbers of vehicles contend for the wireless medium.

#### Results
Figure 16 illustrates the time taken by Robot A to navigate to location X, plotted against the number of contending nodes, for both CarSpeak and two 802.11 benchmarks. In a network with more than six contending wireless transmitters, CarSpeak performs 2.4 times better than the 802.11 baseline and 2.1 times better than 802.11’s MAC with CarSpeak’s multi-resolution naming system. The 802.11 protocol often selects incorrect paths, while CarSpeak correctly chooses detours at intersections with high probability. Although 802.11+Naming shows marginal improvement due to more effective compression, its performance remains poor as much of the available bandwidth is used by other nodes, leaving less room for sensor information.

### Safety Evaluation

This experiment evaluates CarSpeak's effectiveness in improving the safety of autonomous driving by detecting obstacles outside the vehicle's field of view.

#### Method
Consider a topology of robots as shown in Figure 15(b), emulating a common scenario at an intersection. Robot A is navigating towards a T-intersection and needs to merge with traffic on the main road. Ideally, Robot A should yield to Robot B (emulating a human-driven car without sensors) traveling on the main road. However, Robot A’s sensors have a limited field of view and cannot detect Robot B. This situation is one of the most challenging in autonomous vehicle design, often requiring human intervention or additional information about road obstacles [7]. In this setup, Robot C has access to sensor information that captures Robot B. The network includes several other robots contending for the wireless medium, placed in random locations. We evaluate Robot A's ability to detect Robot B using CarSpeak compared to 802.11 baseline implementations, repeating the experiment with different numbers of contending vehicles.

#### Results
Figure 17 plots the percentage of successful detection of Robot B against the number of wireless nodes contending for the medium. As the number of robots increases, the performance of 802.11 and 802.11+Naming deteriorates to as low as 6.1% and 11.9%, respectively. In contrast, CarSpeak successfully detects Robot B with a 91% probability. In a network with over six transmitters, CarSpeak's probability of detecting Robot B is 14 times that of 802.11 and 6.5 times that of 802.11+Naming.

### Outdoor Experiments on an Autonomous Vehicle

CarSpeak was implemented in an outdoor setting at a pedestrian crosswalk in a campus-like environment. This crosswalk presents a hazardous setting where buildings on either side completely block the view, making it impossible for vehicles to see pedestrians before they emerge onto the street. See Figure 9. Our empirical results demonstrate CarSpeak's capability to improve the stopping time of an autonomous Yamaha G22E golf car over 802.11 when point cloud sensor data for pedestrians in the vehicle’s blind spot is transmitted.

#### Method
Our setup includes six Kinect sensors placed adjacent to the pedestrian crosswalk, monitoring the vehicle's blind spot. Five of these Kinects monitor different sections of the environment, while only one is strategically placed to monitor the pedestrian crosswalk. Each Kinect broadcasts its point cloud sensor information using an Asus netbook. A receiver node on the autonomous golf car, a Vaio VPCF23BFX laptop, processes the sensor data to infer the presence of a pedestrian in the critical region. The pedestrian detection module issues a positive reading if the number of point cloud data points within the critical region exceeds a threshold of 1000 points. Upon detecting a pedestrian, the receiver immediately publishes a stop command to the golf car through a ROS publish/subscribe interface. We compare CarSpeak against the traditional 802.11 protocol for data transmission.

For performance metrics, we log the sensor data to detect the exact time when the pedestrian appears in front of the transmitting Kinect. This time is compared with the timestamp of the stop command issued to the vehicle. Using the vehicle’s onboard localization and the two timestamps, we also compare the distance of the vehicle from the crosswalk when the pedestrian enters and when the stop command is issued.

The golf car drives from 15 meters away towards the crosswalk. We perform the experiment by allowing the pedestrian to enter the crosswalk's blind spot when the golf car is traveling at a full speed of two meters per second at distances of ten, eight, six, four, and two meters from the crosswalk. For all results, we assume the pedestrian takes an additional 0.5 seconds to enter the crosswalk from the time they are detected. The results are averaged over five runs for each distance using both CarSpeak and the traditional 802.11 protocols.

#### Results
Figure 18 shows a clear improvement in the vehicle's ability to safely stop before the crosswalk using CarSpeak compared to 802.11. CarSpeak allows the receiver to issue a stop command with a minimum average delay of 0.3 seconds and a maximum average delay of 0.45 seconds from when the pedestrian appears in the Kinect's field of view. The maximum average delay using CarSpeak is 4.75 times smaller than the minimum delay of 2.14 seconds using 802.11.

These small delays using CarSpeak allow the vehicle to safely stop before the crosswalk even when it is one to two meters away and traveling at two meters per second. In contrast, the traditional 802.11 protocol fails to stop the car before the crosswalk if a pedestrian appears when the vehicle is closer than four meters. See Figure 19. CarSpeak enables a larger portion of critical information requested by the golf car from the priority Kinect sensor to reach the receiver, whereas 802.11 floods the receiver with more data from irrelevant sources.

### Conclusion

This paper introduces CarSpeak, a content-centric communication system for autonomous driving, enabling cars to query and access sensory information captured by other cars. Field tests using iRobot robots and a Yamaha instrumented car show that CarSpeak improves safety, increases information throughput, and reduces navigation time in obstacle-ridden environments compared to the 802.11 baseline.
