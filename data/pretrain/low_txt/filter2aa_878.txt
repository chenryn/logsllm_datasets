#### The Story

I recently purchased some coffee on eBay, and something unexpected arrived with my order. It was a retail item valued at $280, which I did not purchase. This is a classic case of triangulation fraud.

Intrigued, I decided to buy more coffee on eBay. And then, I bought even more. Each time, I received additional items that I hadn't ordered, all of significant value.

One seller was very polite and even canceled my order, suggesting, "Maybe you ought to contact the FBIâ€¦?"
