**CTA-CN-2020-0728**

**1. Introduction**

Insikt Group® researchers utilized proprietary Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis and RAT controller detections, along with standard analytical techniques, to identify and profile a cyberespionage campaign attributed to a suspected Chinese state-sponsored threat group, which we are tracking as RedDelta. Data sources include the Recorded Future® Platform, Farsight Security’s DNSDB, SecurityTrails, VirusTotal, Shodan, BinaryEdge, and common OSINT methods.

This report will be of particular interest to network defenders in the private and public sectors, as well as non-governmental organizations with a presence in Asia, and those interested in Chinese geopolitics.

**2. Executive Summary**

From early May 2020, the Vatican and the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong were among several Catholic Church-related organizations targeted by RedDelta, a Chinese state-sponsored threat group. This series of suspected network intrusions also targeted the Hong Kong Study Mission to China and the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME) in Italy. These organizations had not been previously reported as targets of Chinese threat groups.

These intrusions occurred ahead of the anticipated September 2020 renewal of the landmark 2018 China-Vatican provisional agreement, which reportedly gave the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) more control and oversight over the country’s historically persecuted “underground” Catholic community. In addition to the Holy See itself, another likely target was the current head of the Hong Kong Study Mission to China, whose predecessor played a vital role in the 2018 agreement.

The suspected intrusion into the Vatican would provide RedDelta insight into the Holy See’s negotiating position ahead of the deal’s renewal. The targeting of the Hong Kong Study Mission and its Catholic Diocese could also offer valuable intelligence on the diocese’s relations with the Vatican and its stance on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement, especially in light of widespread protests and the recent Hong Kong national security law.

While there is considerable overlap between the observed TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) of RedDelta and the threat group publicly referred to as Mustang Panda (also known as BRONZE PRESIDENT and HoneyMyte), there are notable distinctions:

- The version of PlugX used by RedDelta in this campaign uses a different C2 traffic encryption method and has a different configuration encryption mechanism than traditional PlugX.
- The malware infection chain employed in this campaign has not been publicly reported as used by Mustang Panda.

In addition to targeting entities related to the Catholic Church, Insikt Group also identified RedDelta targeting law enforcement and government entities in India and a government organization in Indonesia.

**3. Key Judgments**

- The targeting of entities related to the Catholic Church is likely indicative of CCP objectives to consolidate control over the “underground” Catholic Church, “sinicize religions” in China, and diminish the perceived influence of the Vatican within China’s Catholic community.
- Due to RedDelta’s targeting of organizations that align with Chinese strategic interests, use of shared tooling traditionally used by China-based groups, and overlaps with a suspected Chinese state-sponsored threat group, Insikt Group believes that the group likely operates on behalf of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) government.
- The identified RedDelta intrusions feature infrastructure, tooling, and victimology overlap with the threat group publicly reported as Mustang Panda, including the use of overlapping network infrastructure and similar victimology, as well as using malware typically used by Mustang Panda, such as PlugX, Poison Ivy, and Cobalt Strike.

**4. Threat Analysis**

**4.1 Overview of Catholic Church Intrusions**

Using Recorded Future RAT controller detections and network traffic analysis, Insikt Group identified multiple PlugX C2 servers communicating with Vatican hosts from mid-May until at least July 21, 2020. Concurrently, we identified Poison Ivy and Cobalt Strike Beacon C2 infrastructure also communicating with Vatican hosts, a Vatican-themed phishing lure delivering PlugX, and the targeting of other entities associated with the Catholic Church.

The lure document, previously reported in relation to Hong Kong Catholic Church targeting, was used to deliver a customized PlugX payload that communicated with the C2 domain systeminfor[.]com. The document purported to be an official Vatican letter addressed to the current head of the Hong Kong Study Mission to China. It is unclear whether the actors created the document themselves or obtained and weaponized a legitimate document. Given that the letter was directly addressed to this individual, it is likely that he was the target of a spearphishing attempt. Additionally, as this sample was compiled after signs of an intrusion within the Vatican network, it is possible that the phishing lure was sent through a compromised Vatican account. This hypothesis is supported by the identification of communications between PlugX C2s and a Vatican mail server in the days surrounding the sample’s compilation date and its first submission to public malware repositories.

**4.2 Background: China and the Catholic Church**

For many years, Chinese state-sponsored groups have targeted religious minorities within the PRC, particularly those within the so-called “Five Poisons,” such as Tibetan, Falun Gong, and Uighur Muslim communities. Insikt Group has publicly reported on aspects of this activity, such as our findings on RedAlpha, the ext4 backdoor, and Scanbox watering hole campaigns targeting the Central Tibetan Administration, other Tibetan entities, and the Turkistan Islamic Party. Most recently, a July 2020 U.S. indictment identified the targeting of emails belonging to Chinese Christian religious figures — a Xi’an-based pastor, as well as an underground church pastor in Chengdu, the latter of whom was later arrested by the PRC government, by two contractors allegedly operating on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). Regional branches of China’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS) have also been heavily involved in digital surveillance of ethnic and religious minorities within the PRC, most notably by the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau (XPSB) in the case of Uighur Muslims.

Historically, the PRC has had a highly turbulent relationship with the Vatican and its governing body, the Holy See. In particular, the Holy See’s recognition of bishops within China’s historically persecuted “underground” Catholic Church, traditionally loyal to the Vatican, and its relationship with Taiwan have maintained an absence of official relations since the 1950s. The CCP perceived this behavior as the Holy See interfering in religious matters within China. In September 2018, the PRC and the Holy See reached a landmark two-year provisional agreement, marking a significant step towards renewed diplomatic relations.

Under the provisional agreement, China would regain more control over underground churches, and the Vatican in turn would gain increased influence over the appointment of bishops within the state-backed “official” Catholic Church. The deal was met with a mixed reaction, with critics arguing that the deal was a betrayal of the underground Church and would lead to increased persecution of its members. Many of the harshest criticisms came from clergy within Hong Kong. A year after the agreement, numerous reports noted the Vatican’s silence in response to the Hong Kong protests beginning in late 2019, in what critics called an effort to avoid offending Beijing and jeopardizing the 2018 agreement.

**4.3 Further Entities Targeted by RedDelta**

In June and July 2020, RedDelta targeted additional entities associated with the Catholic Church using PlugX, including the mail servers of an international missionary center based in Italy and the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong.

Insikt Group identified two additional phishing lures loading the same customized PlugX variant, which both communicated with the same C2 infrastructure as the Vatican lure. The first sample included a lure document spoofing a news bulletin from the Union of Catholic Asian News regarding the impending introduction of the new Hong Kong national security law. The content of the lure file, titled “About China’s plan for Hong Kong security law.doc,” was taken from a legitimate Union of Catholic Asian News article. The other sample referenced the Vatican using a document titled “QUM, IL VATICANO DELL’ISLAM.doc” for the decoy document. This particular decoy document translates as “Qum, the Vatican of Islam,” referring to the Iranian city of Qum (Qom), an important Shi’ite political and religious center. It is taken from the writings of Franco Ometto, an Italian Catholic academic living in Iran. Although the direct target of these two lures is unclear, both relate to the Catholic Church.

We believe that this targeting is indicative of China’s objective to consolidate increased control over the underground Catholic Church within China and diminish the perceived influence of the Vatican on Chinese Catholics. Similarly, a focus on Hong Kong Catholics amid pro-democracy protests and the recent sweeping national security law is in line with Chinese strategic interests, particularly given the anti-Beijing stance of many of its members, including former Hong Kong Bishop Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun.

**4.4 Other Targeted Organizations**

Insikt Group identified several additional suspected victims communicating with RedDelta C2 infrastructure. While metadata alone does not confirm a compromise, the high volume and repeated communications from hosts within targeted organizations to these C2s are sufficient to indicate a suspected intrusion. A full list of identified targeted organizations is summarized below:

| **Targeted Organization** | **Sector** | **Country/Region of Operation** | **Date of Observed Activity** | **RedDelta C2 IP(s)** |
|---------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| The Vatican/Holy See       | Religious  | The Vatican                      | May 21–July 21, 2020          | 85.209.43[.]21, 103.85.24[.]136, 103.85.24[.]149, 103.85.24[.]190, 154.213.21[.]70, 154.213.21[.]73, 154.213.21[.]207, 167.88.180[.]5, 167.88.180[.]32 |
| Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong | Religious | Hong Kong                        | May 12–July 21, 2020          | 103.85.24[.]136, 167.88.180[.]5, 167.88.180[.]32 |
| Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME), Milan | Religious | Italy                            | June 2–26, 2020              | 85.209.43[.]21 |
| Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy | Law Enforcement | India                          | February 16–June 25, 2020    | 103.85.24[.]136, 167.88.180[.]5 |
| Ministry of Home Affairs (Kementerian Dalam Negeri Republik Indonesia) | Government | Indonesia                       | May 21–July 21, 2020         | 85.209.43[.]21 |
| Airports Authority of India | Government | India                           | June 18–July 21, 2020        | 154.213.21[.]207 |
| Other Unidentified Victims | N/A        | Myanmar, Hong Kong, Ethiopia, Australia | May–July 2020            | 85.209.43[.]21, 103.85.24[.]136, 167.88.180[.]5 |

**4.5 Infrastructure Analysis**

In this campaign, RedDelta favored three primary IP hosting providers and used multiple C2 servers within the same /24 CIDR ranges across intrusions. Preferred hosting providers included 2EZ Network Inc (Canada), Hong Kong Wen Jing Network Limited, and Hong Kong Ai Jia Su Network Limited. The group consistently registered domains through GoDaddy, with WHOIS data providing additional linkages between domains used by the threat group. Insikt Group identified two primary clusters of RedDelta infrastructure used throughout this campaign, referred to as the “PlugX cluster” and the “Poison Ivy and Cobalt Strike cluster.”

**4.5.1 ‘Ma Ge Bei Luo Xiang Gang Jiu Dian’ and the PlugX Cluster**

Vatican hosts and several other victim organizations were communicating with the PlugX C2 167.88.180[.]5 from May until June 10, 2020. This IP hosted the domain cabsecnow[.]com over this time period. Cabsecnow[.]com then resolved to a new IP, 103.85.24[.]136, from June 10 onwards. The suspicious network activity continued after the C2 IP was updated, increasing our confidence in the likelihood of intrusion at the targeted organizations.

The cabsecnow[.]com domain shares a similar naming convention to a publicly reported domain linked to Mustang Panda, cab-sec[.]com. WHOIS data revealed that both domains were registered several seconds apart through GoDaddy on September 17, 2019, with the same registrant organization listed: “Ma Ge Bei Luo Xiang Gang Jiu Dian.” This registrant organization is associated with eight domains in total, five of which have previously been publicly linked to Mustang Panda activity by Anomali and Dell SecureWorks. “Ma Ge Bei Luo Xiang Gang Jiu Dian” translates from Mandarin to Marco Polo Hotel Hong Kong, a legitimate Hong Kong hotel, although it is unclear why the actor chose this organization when registering these domains.

Another PlugX C2, 85.209.43[.]21, was also identified communicating with several hosts within the same targeted organizations (see Table 1). This IP has hosted ipsoftwarelabs[.]com since November 2019, a domain previously identified as a Mustang Panda PlugX C2.

Finally, the C2 domain associated with the Vatican and Union of Catholic Asian News lures, systeminfor[.]com, was hosted on 167.88.180[.]32 since June 2020. This IP has also hosted lameers[.]com since February 2020, another PlugX C2 identified in activity targeting Hong Kong.

**4.5.2 Cobalt Strike/Poison Ivy Cluster**

| **Associated Domain** | **C2 IP Address** | **Malware Variant** |
|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| web.miscrosaft[.]com  | 154.213.21[.]207  | Poison Ivy         |
| lib.jsquerys[.]net    | 154.213.21[.]70   | Cobalt Strike      |
| lib.hostareas[.]com   | 154.213.21[.]73   | Unknown            |

The second cluster featured Cobalt Strike and Poison Ivy malware C2 infrastructure. A Poison Ivy sample (SHA256:9bac74c592a36ee249d6e0b086bfab395a37537ec87c2095f999c00b946ae81d) submitted to a public malware repository from Italy in early June 2020, several days after the first evidence of activity between Vatican hosts and this C2, was configured to communicate with a spoofed Microsoft domain, web.miscrosaft[.]com, hosted on 154.213.21[.]207.

**5. Conclusion**

The targeting of the Vatican and other Catholic organizations by RedDelta highlights the strategic importance of these entities to the CCP. The timing of the intrusions, coinciding with the renewal of the China-Vatican provisional agreement, suggests that the group aims to gather intelligence on the Holy See’s negotiating position and the internal dynamics of the Catholic Church in China and Hong Kong. The use of sophisticated malware and the overlap with other known Chinese threat groups underscore the need for robust cybersecurity measures and continuous monitoring by organizations with ties to the Catholic Church and other potential targets of Chinese state-sponsored activities.
