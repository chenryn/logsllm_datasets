### Feature Updates
- **Installer**: Automatically registers required resource providers. Enhanced handling of conflicts arising from multiple versions of AzureRm PS modules.
- **Subscription Security**: Added support for automated removal of 'deprecated' accounts.
- **Security Verification Tests (SVTs)**: Introduced SVTs for the Azure Load Balancer service.
- **Continuous Assurance**:
  - Updated `Get-CA` cmdlet to perform a deep diagnosis of defunct CA setups.
  - Provided detailed guidance for users at the end of the `Install-CA` process.
- **Output Reports**: Added support for generating reports in PDF format, suitable for auditing scenarios.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Implemented support for AzSDK SVTs in CICD for Jenkins.

### Other Improvements and Bug Fixes
- **VM Controls**: Separated the status of anti-malware, disk encryption, and patched state for better visibility.
- **ASC Tasks/Recommendations**: Only 'active' tasks and recommendations will result in control failure; 'dismissed' ones are now filtered out. This allows for finer control over which ASC recommendations are treated as required organization-wide.
- **ASC Email & Phone Handling**: Ensured consistent handling of email and phone settings. The provided values will always overwrite current settings.
- **Output Logs Folder Naming**: Added cmdlet acronyms to the end of output logs folder names for easier identification of past runs (e.g., "20170801_005414_UCA" for `Update-AzSDKContinuousAssurance`, "20170731_231345_GSS" for `Get-AzSDKSubscriptionSecurity`).
- **Storage SVT**: Added a new control check to enforce HTTPS endpoints on storage accounts.
- **Custom RBAC Roles and ER-mgmt Certs**: Whitelisted custom RBAC roles and ER-mgmt certificates. Approved Service Principals (SPNs) will not be flagged as objectionable.
- **Deprecated Accounts**: Moved ACI, SDO Analytics, and Cloud Cruiser related accounts to the 'deprecated' list.
