### Historical For-Profit Malware
- **J2ME/Redbrowser.A**
  - **Functionality:**
    - First reported J2ME trojan (2006)
    - Pretends to access WAP web pages via SMS messages
    - Written using the MIDletPascal programming tool
  - **Profit Mechanism:**
    - Sends SMS messages to Premium Rate SMS numbers
    - Spawned numerous J2ME malware variants
  - **Installation Prompt (Symbian OS, S60 UI):**
    - "Carefully read the following description of RedBrowser. This program allows viewing WAP pages without GPRS connection. RedBrowser connects to SMS server of your operator (MTS, BEELINE, MEGAFON). Page is loaded by receiving coded SMS. First 5Mb (650 SMS) of traffic are provided free of charge in test mode. ATTENTION!!! Program RedBrowser works ONLY on above-mentioned cellular operators."

- **J2ME/Wesber.A**
  - **Functionality:**
    - No GUI, almost pure for-profit J2ME trojan
    - Disguises itself as an assistant program
    - Contains two JPG files within itself
  - **Profit Mechanism:**
    - Sends SMS to premium rate numbers to purchase mobile phone games
    - Presumably written to increase sales for a mobile site
  - **Installation Prompt (Symbian OS, S60 UI):**
    - Similar to RedBrowser, but with no user-visible interface.

### Modern For-Profit Malware
- **Geographical Distribution:**
  - **100+ Variants:** Primarily J2ME with some Android; SMS sending trojans
  - **200+ Variants:** J2ME, Symbian, Android; SMS trojans, privacy stealing

- **Profit Mechanisms:**
  - **Production:**
    - Independent malware authors
    - Produce malware for sale
  - **Distribution:**
    - Forums, freeware sites, pirated software sites
  - **Monetization:**
    - **Premium Rate Numbers:**
      - Ringtones, downloads, data services/newsfeeds
    - **Click Fraud, Black Hat SEO:**
      - Traffic generation, pay-per-click (PPC) ads
    - **Stealing and Reselling PII:**
      - Personal Identifiable Information
    - **SMS Phishing, Injecting Fake SMS:**
      - Download malware/adware, drive traffic
    - **Stealing Accounts (Skype, QQ, SIM balances):**
      - Using partner businesses to cash out

- **Detection and Analysis Evasion Methods:**
  - **Infection of/Injection into Clean Apps:**
    - **J2ME:**

      - Obfuscations (hiding SMS numbers/message text within plaintext HTML files)
      - Substitution cipher (config file containing encrypted SMS numbers/message text)
    - **Complex:**
      - Symmetric cipher (DES used by Android/Geinimi, Android/DrddreamLite)
  - **Reduce Security/Bypass Protection:**
    - **Disable Software Installation Controls:**
      - WinCE/InfoJack.A turns off the unsigned application prompt
    - **Root Vulnerabilities:**
      - Exploits used to gain a foothold on devices (e.g., Android/DrdDream, Android/DrddreamLite)
    - **Jailbreaking:**
      - Not widely seen in the wild, used only in PoCs (e.g., Eric Monti's modified jailbreak at Toorcon 2010)
