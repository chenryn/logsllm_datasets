### Details

Currently, Dubbo does not support resolving all placeholders from property values across any `PropertySource`. This limitation affects the external configuration capabilities in Dubbo Spring Boot. For example, it impacts the ability to use external configuration placeholders in properties, as highlighted in the following issue:
- [Can provider boot features external config placeholders in properties?](#)

Additionally, Dubbo's `PropertySourcesUtils` class is slated for removal and will be replaced by Alibaba's `spring-context-support`'s `PropertySourcesUtils`.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
