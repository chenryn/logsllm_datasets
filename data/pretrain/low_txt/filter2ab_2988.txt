**ATT&CK ID:** T1552.006  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Group Policy Preferences

Adversaries may attempt to exploit unsecured credentials stored within Group Policy Preferences (GPP). GPP is a feature that enables administrators to create and apply domain policies, which can include embedded credentials. These policies are often used to set or manage local accounts on systems within the domain. If these credentials are not properly secured, they can be extracted and misused by malicious actors.
