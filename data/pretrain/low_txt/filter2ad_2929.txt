## Abstract
The next generation of automobiles, also known as CyberVehicles, will increasingly incorporate electronic control units in novel automotive control applications. Recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of modern automotive control systems to security attacks, which directly impact the physical safety and dependability of CyberVehicles.

The First International Academic Workshop on Security, Privacy, and Dependability for CyberVehicles (CyCAR'13) focuses on security and privacy topics relevant to CyberVehicles, aligning with the scope of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). The workshop specifically addresses security and privacy issues in computerized, complex, and connected modern vehicles, as well as their intricate supply chains. This event aims to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from the ACM CCS community to the automotive industry, considering typical automotive constraints such as interoperability, reliability, dependability, quality, resource limitations, and complex supply chain management.

## 1. Introduction
Modern automotive systems integrate a multitude of embedded real-time control functionalities and advanced information and entertainment (infotainment) features. The paradigm shift in future automotive (CyberVehicle) systems and other transportation systems, such as avionics, maritime, and rail, is driven by the increasing plurality of subsystems and functions, as well as unprecedented levels of intra- and inter-CyberVehicle system connections and communications, including networking with external entities like smart mobile devices and the cloud.

The development of CyberVehicles is both necessary and inevitable, offering business opportunities and enhanced user comfort. For example, traffic congestion avoidance services that leverage cloud connectivity and global route conditions can mitigate business losses due to traffic jams in metropolitan areas. Such services must prioritize safety and security, as attacks on one subsystem or network component can affect a larger portion of the connected system.

The First International Academic Workshop on Security, Privacy, and Dependability for CyberVehicles (CyCAR'13) brings together researchers and practitioners in the security domain related to modern and next-generation automotive systems. The workshop solicited two types of original papers: full papers and short/work-in-progress/position papers. The goal is to foster discussions, identify, and address challenges related to achieving secure, dependable, and privacy-preserving CyberVehicle systems.

## 2. Format
CyCAR'2013 will be a full-day workshop program on the first day of CCS 2013. The workshop will begin with an invited talk by Ulrich Huber, Associate Principal of McKinsey & Company, responsible for automotive solutions. In his talk, "Mobility of the Future," Ulrich will present his views on the roadmap of future applications in the area of CyberVehicles and their impact on security and privacy. The workshop will also feature accepted paper sessions, each concluding with a discussion led by a pre-chosen participant. These discussions aim to tie together common themes and lead to insightful discussions about future research directions. The program will end with a panel discussion where panelists will discuss the current state of the art, focus areas, and opportunities for future research.
