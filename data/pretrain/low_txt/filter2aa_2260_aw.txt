### Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards

**Little Rock (Arkansas)**

#### Summary
- **Governance:** Advanced Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

**Designated Area:**
Arkansas designated Little Rock as its metropolitan area, which includes Pulaski County and the cities of Cammack Village, Jacksonville, Little Rock, Maumelle, North Little Rock, Shannon Hills, Sherwood, and Wrightsville.

#### Governance: Advanced Implementation
The Little Rock Metropolitan Area Working Group developed the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) and includes operations and technical subcommittees for interoperable communications. The area has formal agreements (e.g., mutual aid agreement with the State Emergency Management Department) among public safety organizations, with a review process to update these agreements every 3 to 5 years. Although strategic planning efforts have been ongoing since 1996, a published regional strategic plan for interoperability is not yet available. Funding for equipment and budgets is managed through locally funded bonds, federal, and state grants, with fiscal priorities clearly outlined in the municipal bond. The senior leaders in the area serve as advocates for interoperability, ensuring continued political and fiscal support.

**Recommendations:**
- Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding, intergovernmental agreements) in the TICP and store them in an accessible format.
- Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational TICP) with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, that takes into account a long-term communications funding strategy (beyond grants).
- Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met.
- Define a funding strategy for regional sustainable funding sources (beyond bonds and grants) to cover lifecycle and recurring costs to operate the area’s interoperability assets.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation
The Little Rock TICP consolidated existing interoperable communications SOPs (e.g., state and local mutual aid agreements) into a regional plan. These SOPs were already well established and frequently used, facilitating the adoption of the TICP. The TICP has been disseminated to dispatch centers but not to all included agencies. During the TICP validation exercise, the area was largely successful in using documented procedures, despite minor issues with radio channel designation. The Little Rock area has adopted NIMS/ICS and has been implementing it within the last year. Participants demonstrated familiarity with NIMS/ICS during the exercise.

**Recommendations:**
- Develop regional training policies and requirements for inclusion in the TICP.
- Ensure consistent reference in the TICP regarding “NIMS is recommended” and “NIMS is required.”
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage: Established Implementation
The area frequently uses its interoperable communications solutions (i.e., shared channels and systems) for task force and mutual aid incidents. Officials report proficiency during real-world events (e.g., use of shared channels during river rescues). During the TICP validation exercise, participants established interoperable communications despite some minimal technical difficulties. The exercise did not provide the opportunity to demonstrate interoperable communications with federal agencies in the area.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to involve state and federal agencies (e.g., State Police, FBI) in day-to-day events and future exercises.
- Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day activities.

#### Technology Overview
The area has one 800 MHz Motorola communications system shared by most agencies. However, interoperable talk groups have yet to be programmed into all radios, and different disciplines and jurisdictions have different profiles. No gateways are available, and the primary means of interoperable communications currently consists of shared conventional channels (e.g., National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee channels and Hospital Emergency Administrative Radio channels). The Little Rock area is adding talk groups to its fleet map to increase interoperability. Plans at the state level are unknown, although personnel from both the state and Little Rock have participated in the TICP validation exercises to gain insight into interoperability options and procedures.

**Connecticut Region 1**

#### Summary
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

**Designated Area:**
Connecticut’s metropolitan area, also known as Region 1, includes the following jurisdictions: Bridgeport, Darien, Easton, Fairfield, Greenwich, Monroe, New Canaan, Norwalk, Stamford, Stratford, Trumbull, Weston, Westport, and Wilton.

#### Governance: Intermediate Implementation
The Connecticut Region 1 Communications Working Group reports to the Emergency Support Function II communications subcommittee and includes local, state, and federal agencies within the area (e.g., transportation, public health, state police, U.S. Coast Guard, FBI). The region is taking steps toward formalizing partnerships and written agreements (e.g., MOUs) among the area’s organizations. A formalized strategic plan for regional interoperable communications is not yet in place, preventing alignment to collective, regional goals. Funding for interoperability solutions is managed through local resources and federal grants, but a sustainable funding strategy has not been defined. Leadership in the region provides the needed level of political and fiscal support for regional interoperable communications, with an executive order for interoperability issued by the governor and some local financial resources dedicated to funding interoperability equipment and solutions.

**Recommendations:**
- Establish the Region 1 Communications Working Group through a formal charter and document roles and responsibilities of all participating agencies as part of the group.
- Reference by date, title, or document number, all applicable agreements (e.g., MOUs, intergovernmental agreements) in the TICP and store them in an accessible format.
- Document and formalize agreements (e.g., signed MOUs with defined roles and responsibilities) among all participating agencies relating to regional interoperability.
- Establish a regular review process to ensure that agreements remain current and relevant.
- Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational TICP) with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, that takes into account a long-term communications funding strategy (beyond grants).
- Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met.
- Initiate the development and implementation of a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) sustainable funding that is consistent with the strategic plan.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation
Region 1 incorporated existing policies and procedures into the TICP. These SOPs were already well established and frequently used, facilitating the adoption of the TICP. The area has taken steps to disseminate these SOPs (e.g., distributed to all included organizations and dispatch centers, held the TICP Implementation Workshop) to ensure their swift adoption. During the TICP validation exercise, participants demonstrated familiarity with executing their SOPs but experienced minor procedural problems. The Region 1 began implementing NIMS/ICS less than a year ago, indicating they are still in the early stages of implementation. Despite this, the area has included first responders and other public safety organizations (e.g., public health) in the implementation and training. During the exercise, participants demonstrated familiarity with NIMS/ICS but did not show proficiency in all areas (e.g., ICS Form 205 not distributed).

**Recommendations:**
- Update the TICP to incorporate all available interoperable communications equipment (e.g., inconsistencies with gateways in the TICP).
- Continue to regularly review and update policies and procedures.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage: Established Implementation
The Region 1 reports regular use of its available means of interoperable communications (e.g., shared channels, gateways, shared systems) in day-to-day operations. Officials reported demonstrated success during real-world events (e.g., multijurisdictional pursuit of a suspect). During the TICP validation exercise, evaluators indicated that Region 1 responders did a “good job” of establishing tactical interoperable communications between both local and regional responders. However, users did not understand the limitations of their shared channels.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources to improve proficiency (e.g., radio cache, shared channels).
- Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day activities.

#### Technology Overview
Fairfield County consists of 14 towns and cities with at least 26 different public safety radio systems. The only interoperability among public safety agencies in the area is the 800 MHz ITAC/ICALL channels and the Statewide Tactical On-Scene Communication System (STOCS). STOCS, which provides shared channels across the very high frequency, ultra-high frequency, and 800 MHz bands, had not been fully implemented at the time of the TICP validation exercise. The State of Connecticut is planning to implement STOCS in all counties. Region 1 is planning to continue training on and using the ITAC/ICALL channels, as well as gateways and other interoperability solutions throughout the region and the rest of the state.

**Wilmington (Delaware)**

#### Summary
- **Governance:** Established Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

**Designated Area:**
Delaware designated the City of Wilmington as its metropolitan area, which includes the counties of Kent, New Castle, and Sussex.

#### Governance: Established Implementation
Wilmington’s Tactical Interoperable Communication Plan (TICP) was expanded to cover the entire state rather than just one metropolitan area, consistent with the statewide communications infrastructure and governance structure established by the Governor three years ago. This governance group, known as the “Next Generation Committee,” is composed of state and local agencies from all first responder disciplines, as well as additional public support services. The group has a charter with active rules and agreements in place, and has created funding strategies through 2008. Although Wilmington has developed a strategic plan that covers the entire state, it has not yet been fully adopted by all participating organizations and is not reviewed/updated annually.

**Recommendations:**
- Suggest continuing to proactively recruit other members that need to be part of the group, including federal participants that are present in the area (e.g., U.S. Coast Guard).
- Encourage full adoption of the strategic plan with acceptance from all participants, and with reviews and updates on an annual basis.
- Encourage a regional communications interoperability funding strategy, including long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) funding sources (in addition to grants).

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation
Wilmington had pre-existing SOPs, primarily for its two major 800 MHz systems, which were incorporated into the TICP. As a result, the TICP was expanded to cover all three counties in the state. These policies have begun to be disseminated, and Wilmington is in the process of incorporating the TICP into the Delaware Emergency Operations Plan and as a requirement in all exercises. It was noted at the TICP validation exercise that plain language was not used at the incident. Delaware is also in the process of implementing NIMS/ICS and the Communications Unit Leader duties. Gaps in these areas (e.g., plain language not used) will be addressed through additional training and exercises. For example, there was a lack of unified command at the incident, and two separate, distinct incident command structures were in place. According to the After Action Report, Delaware’s “public service agencies have a solid foundation in their approach to emergencies and they know their plan and procedures well.” The state’s team approach, including city and county agencies, is commendable and should be considered a best practice.

**Recommendation:**
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage: Established Implementation
Wilmington achieves communications interoperability through a shared system and fixed gateways. Additional training is needed to more fluently use the mobile gateway system. The majority of agencies are using the state’s 800 MHz statewide shared system, which provides interoperability on a daily basis. The use of these systems was successfully demonstrated during the TICP validation exercise, allowing local and regional first responders to communicate effectively. Technical failures impeded the proper implementation of the mobile command center equipment, indicating the need for additional training to operate the state’s mobile gateways, which would be necessary to support federal agencies or responders from other states during a large-scale incident.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to conduct training on available technology (e.g., mobile gateway system) to improve familiarity with the capability and work toward seamless integration.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

#### Technology Overview
The Wilmington area uses two large interconnected 800 MHz radio systems. The State of Delaware operates on an 800 MHz SmartZone™, and the City of Wilmington operates an 800 MHz SMARTNET™ system. The state has six radio caches (five in the 800 MHz band and one in the ultra-high frequency band) and has three types of gateway devices available for use. Statewide communications interoperability is also supported by the use of the five National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee frequencies.
