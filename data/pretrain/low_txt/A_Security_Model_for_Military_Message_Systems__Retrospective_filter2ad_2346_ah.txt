### 6. Conclusions

We advocate an approach to building secure systems that incorporates an application-based security model. An example of such a model and its formalization has been presented, intended as a guide for others who wish to adopt this methodology. Key aspects of the model are summarized below:

1. **User-Centric Security Requirements**: The model is framed in terms of operations and data objects that users interact with, making it easier for them to understand the system's security requirements.
2. **Hierarchical Access Control**: The model defines a hierarchy of entities and references, allowing access control based on the path used to refer to an entity.
3. **Implementation Flexibility**: By avoiding the specification of implementation strategies, the model provides software developers the freedom to choose the most effective implementation methods.
4. **Comprehensive Security Assessment**: The model and its formalization provide a basis for certifiers to evaluate the overall security of the system.

Simplicity and clarity in the model's statement have been primary goals. However, the model does not oversimplify to the point of distorting the user's view of the system. This work demonstrates the feasibility of defining an application-based security model informally and subsequently formalizing it. The security model described has been adopted with minimal changes by another message system project [9] and adapted for use in document preparation and bibliographic systems [2].

The full-scale application of our approach in building comprehensive systems will be the ultimate test of its viability. We are currently pursuing this through the development of message system prototypes [11, 12].

### Acknowledgments

Many individuals contributed to the work reported here. Initial discussions with David Parnas led to the first version of the security model. Later revisions were based on reviews by Jon Millen, Stan Wilson, Mark Cornwell, Rob Jacob, Jim Miller, Marv Schaefer, and numerous others. Participants in the 1982 Air Force Summer Study on Multilevel Data Management Security also provided valuable feedback. We are grateful to H. O. Lubbes of the Naval Electronic Systems Command and the Office of Naval Research for their financial support.
