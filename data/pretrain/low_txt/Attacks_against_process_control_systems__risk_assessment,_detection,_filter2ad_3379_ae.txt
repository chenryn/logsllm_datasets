### Automatic Response Mechanism Under Attack

The automatic response mechanism functions effectively when the system is under attack. As illustrated in Figure 13, when an attack is detected, the response algorithm successfully maintains the system in a safe state. Similar results were observed for all detectable attacks.

While our attack response mechanism is effective when alarms genuinely indicate attacks, our primary concern in this section is the cost of false alarms. To address this, we conducted 1000 simulations without any actual attacks, each running for 40 hours. The results, summarized in Table 1, show that with the parameter set \( \tau_{y4} = 50 \), \( \tau_{y5} = 10000 \), and \( \tau_{y7} = 200 \), no false alarms were detected. Consequently, we report the expected pressure, standard deviation of the pressure, and the maximum pressure reached under these conditions.

To further investigate, we reduced the detection thresholds to \( \tau_{y4} = 5 \), \( \tau_{y5} = 1000 \), and \( \tau_{y7} = 20 \) and reran the experiments. Table 2 presents the behavior of the pressure after the response to a false alarm. Although the false response mechanism increases the tank's pressure, it never reaches unsafe levels. The maximum pressure obtained while controlling the system based on the linear model was 2779 kPa, which is comparable to the normal pressure variation without any false alarms (2757 kPa).

In our case, even if the system remains in a safe state through the automated response, our strategy is intended as a temporary solution until a human operator can respond to the alarm. Based on our results, we believe that the time required for a human response can be quite long, potentially several hours.

### Conclusions

In this work, we identified three new research challenges for securing control systems. By incorporating a physical model of the system, we were able to identify the most critical sensors and attacks. We also studied the use of physical models for anomaly detection and proposed three generic types of stealthy attacks. Finally, we proposed the use of automatic response mechanisms based on estimates of the system's state. While automatic responses can be problematic, especially if the response to a false alarm is costly, we emphasize that the automatic response mechanism should be considered a temporary solution before a human investigates the alarm. A full deployment of any automatic response mechanism should take into account the reasonable response time for a human operator and the potential side effects of responding to a false alarm.

### Experimental Results with TE-PCS Process

Our experiments with the TE-PCS process yielded several key findings:
1. **Integrity Attacks vs. DoS Attacks**: Protecting against integrity attacks is more critical than protecting against DoS attacks, as the latter have negligible impact on the TE-PCS process.
2. **System Behavior**: The chemical reactor process is well-behaved, meaning that even under perturbations, the system's response closely follows our linear models. The slow dynamics of this process allow us to detect attacks with large delays without raising false alarms.
3. **False Alarms**: Even when the system was configured to generate false alarms, the automatic response mechanism maintained the system in a safe mode.

One of our main conclusions regarding the TE-PCS plant is that it is a highly resiliently-designed process control system. The design of such resilient systems requires extensive control system design experience and expertise. The design process involves iteratively evaluating performance under various adverse conditions and modifying control loop structures to build in resilience. Ricker's paper discusses the set of random faults that the four-loop PI control can withstand.

We make two points in this regard:
1. **Distributed Control Structure**: The PI control loop structure is distributed, meaning no single PI control loop controls all actuators or has access to all sensor measurements.
2. **Resilience to Cyber Attacks**: The set of adverse situations that this control structure can withstand may result from one or more cyber attacks. However, even though the resilience of the TE-PCS plant is ensured by expert design, it is interesting to directly test this resilience within the framework of assessment, detection, and response presented in this article.

However, as a cautionary note, large-scale control system designs are often not inherently resilient and may become vulnerable to stealth attacks if sufficient resilience is not built into the design. Thus, our ideas are particularly relevant for operational security until there is a principled way of designing fully attack-resilient control structures and algorithms, which is a challenging research endeavor and may not offer a cost-effective solution.

### Generalizability

Although our analysis focused on a chemical reactor system, the principles and techniques can be applied to many other physical processes. An automatic detection and response module may not be practical for all control system processes; however, we believe that many processes with characteristics similar to the TE-PCS can benefit from this kind of response.
