### True Mapping and De-anonymization

It is likely that human intelligence can be utilized to complete de-anonymization in many cases. Specifically, 55% of the incorrectly identified mappings (6.7% overall) were mapped to nodes where the same geographic location was reported. Even when re-identification does not succeed, the algorithm can often identify a node as belonging to a cluster of similar nodes, which might reveal sensitive information (refer to the discussion in Section 4.4).

The above two categories overlap; of all the incorrect mappings, only 27% (or 3.3% overall) fall into neither category and are completely erroneous.

### Conclusion

The primary takeaway from this paper is that anonymity alone is insufficient for privacy in social networks. We developed a generic re-identification algorithm and demonstrated its effectiveness in de-anonymizing several thousand users in the anonymous graph of a popular microblogging service (Twitter), using a completely different social network (Flickr) as the source of auxiliary information.

Our experiments likely underestimate the extent of privacy risks associated with anonymized social networks. The overlap between Twitter and Flickr membership at the time of our data collection was relatively small. Considering only the users who provided their names (about a third in either network), 24% of the names associated with Twitter accounts occurred in Flickr, while 5% of the names associated with Flickr accounts occurred in Twitter. Since human names are not unique, this overestimates the overlap in membership. By contrast, 64% of Facebook users are also present on MySpace [58]. As social networks grow larger and include a greater fraction of the population along with their relationships, the overlap increases. Therefore, we expect that our algorithm can achieve an even higher re-identification rate on larger networks.

This was measured by sampling 200 of the erroneous mappings and using human analysis. We consider the geographical location to be the same if it is either the same non-U.S. country or the same U.S. state.

We demonstrated the feasibility of successful re-identification based solely on network topology, assuming the target graph is completely anonymized. In reality, anonymized graphs are usually released with at least some attributes in their nodes and edges, making de-anonymization even easier. Furthermore, any of the thousands of third-party application developers for popular online social networks, the dozens of advertising companies, governments with access to telephone call logs, and anyone who can compile aggregated graphs of the form described in Section 2 have access to auxiliary information much richer than what we used in our experiments.

At the same time, an ever-growing number of third parties gain access to sensitive social-network data in anonymized form. These two trends appear to be headed for a collision resulting in major privacy breaches. Any potential solution would appear to necessitate a fundamental shift in business models and practices, as well as clearer privacy laws concerning Personally Identifiable Information.
