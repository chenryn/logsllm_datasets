## Abstract
Inspired by recent techniques for reliable bulk data distribution, this paper develops scalable protocols for the reliable on-demand delivery of streaming media. We present models that quantify the best possible scalability for given client characteristics and use these models to guide the design and assess the performance of the proposed streaming techniques. The new protocols, RPB (Reliable Periodic Broadcast) and RBS (Relible Bandwidth Skimming), are relatively simple to implement and achieve nearly optimal scalability and efficiency for a given set of client characteristics and desired/feasible media quality.

## 1. Introduction
An important challenge for many existing and future Internet applications is the scalable and reliable on-demand delivery of streaming media to potentially large numbers of concurrent clients over lossy and possibly heterogeneous channels. While effective solutions exist for bulk data distribution, such as large software updates, adequate solutions for streaming media content, as required in applications like video-on-demand, are still lacking.

The digital fountain approach [5] is designed to deliver bulk data over channels with significant packet loss, including IP multicast, satellite, and wireless transmission. This method uses erasure codes to construct a stream of packets, allowing a receiver to reconstruct the object from any subset of packets slightly larger than the source data. Each client can start listening at a time of their choosing and continue until they receive enough packets. The method is fully scalable because the server's transmission bandwidth is independent of the number of clients, and it is efficient due to minimal feedback, minimal data reception, and low processing time for reconstruction.

However, the digital fountain approach is not suitable for streaming media, as clients cannot begin playback until most or all of the data is received. Other recent approaches for reliable live or scheduled broadcast delivery of streaming media [33, 13, 7, 23, 4, 21, 30, 9] do not address on-demand scalability. Conversely, recently proposed protocols for scalable on-demand media streaming, such as periodic broadcast [32, 1, 17, 20, 14, 25, 16], patching [8, 18, 6, 15, 29], and bandwidth skimming [12], do not provide reliable delivery over lossy channels. These protocols often require high aggregate transmission rates, which may be infeasible or suboptimal in environments with high packet loss.

This paper introduces new scalable periodic broadcast and bandwidth skimming protocols for reliable, on-demand delivery of streaming media over lossy and possibly heterogeneous channels. We develop models to quantify the best possible scalability for given client characteristics and use these models to guide the design and evaluate the performance of the new protocols. The new protocols, RPB and RBS, are simple to implement and achieve near-optimal scalability and efficiency. Additionally, we propose using these protocols to allow late-arriving clients in live or scheduled multicasts to request missed media content with minimal increase in server bandwidth.

### 1.1 New Protocols
- **Reliable Periodic Broadcast (RPB)**: Fully scalable, includes efficient transmission of redundant data for clients with heterogeneous packet loss rates, requires minimal client feedback, and has tunable latency for beginning media playback. The maximum aggregate transmission rate to any client is a small percentage (e.g., 25%) greater than the minimum rate required for real-time playback.
- **Reliable Bandwidth Skimming (RBS)**: Requires limited client feedback, primarily for initiating new streams. It has minimal startup latency for playback, fully supports interactive client requests, and operates more efficiently than RPB when fewer clients request the media.

## 2. Background
The new protocols build on previously developed concepts of periodic broadcast and bandwidth skimming for scalable on-demand delivery of streaming media. We review previous protocols and an analytic model that provides a lower bound on the server bandwidth required for each class of protocol. This model serves as a basis for evaluating the bandwidth requirements of alternative strategies for packet loss recovery.

### 2.1 Previous Periodic Broadcast Protocols
Previous periodic broadcast schemes divide a media file into segments with a progression of relative segment lengths. For example, the skyscraper broadcast protocol [17] has a segment length progression of 1, 2, 2, 5, 5, 12, 12, 25, 25, ... and a broadcast schedule as depicted in Figure 1. Clients arriving at any point in time obtain a schedule to tune into each channel to receive the segments, starting at the next segment 1 broadcast. This ensures that clients can receive each segment at or before it is needed for playback. The small first segment allows low startup latencies, while larger later segments keep the total number of channels small.

### 2.2 Previous Bandwidth Skimming Protocols
Bandwidth skimming protocols initiate a new multicast transmission for each new client request. In the simplest case, each client listens to the closest earlier active stream, so its own stream can terminate after transmitting the missed data. This hierarchical merging can be implemented when the aggregate transmission rate to the client is less than twice the media playback rate. Results show that bandwidth skimming is more efficient than periodic broadcast protocols at low to moderate client request rates and naturally supports client interactive requests.

### 2.3 Maximum Achievable Scalability
In [10], a tight lower bound is derived on the required server bandwidth for any protocol providing immediate on-demand streaming of multimedia content without packet loss recovery. Assuming the notation in Table 1, the lower bound is:

\[
B_{\text{immed-service}}^{\text{minimum}} = \int_0^T \frac{dx}{x + 1}
\]

This model serves as a basis for the new bounds developed in Section 3 for evaluating the bandwidth requirements of alternative strategies for packet loss recovery in the context of scalable on-demand streaming.

## 3. Alternative Packet Loss Recovery Strategies
We compare alternative packet loss recovery strategies, both qualitatively and through the derivation of simple lower bounds on the required server bandwidth. Sections 4 and 5 develop the proposed new RPB and RBS protocols, respectively, and provide qualitative and quantitative assessments of the new protocols. Conclusions are presented in Section 6.
