"When democracy relies on entertainment to provide knowledge of its secret affairs, the contradictions of empire are 'normalized to invisibility' through a blurring of fictional and real operations."
— Timothy Melley, *The Covert Sphere*

### Project Blue Book
In 1952, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) established Project Blue Book, with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, a Northwestern University astronomer, serving as a resource scientist. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) later became involved and concluded:
- Flying saucers do not pose a threat to national security, but reports of them do.
- Military personnel should be trained in proper observation techniques for flying saucers.
- Programs should be developed to debunk flying saucers to the public.

By 1973, Dr. Hynek, disillusioned with the USAF, founded the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) as an independent organization. He stated:
"The public was, in fact, placed in the role of 'the enemy,' against whom 'counterespionage' tactics must be employed. From my personal experience, I frequently felt that those in charge did consider people who reported UFOs or who took a serious interest in them and wanted information about them, as enemies."
