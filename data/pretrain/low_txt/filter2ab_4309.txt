**ATT&CK ID:** T1556.005  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Reversible Encryption

Adversaries may exploit the Active Directory authentication encryption properties to gain unauthorized access to credentials on Windows systems. The `AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption` property determines whether reversible password encryption is enabled or disabled for a user account. By default, this property is disabled, and user credentials are stored as the output of one-way hashing functions. Enabling this property should be avoided unless it is specifically required by legacy or other software.
