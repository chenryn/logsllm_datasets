**The Remarkable Advancements in Fuel Efficiency and Safety**

It is astounding to consider that this car, which is not even the most fuel-efficient in its class, achieves similar fuel economy to a Ford Fiesta. If you were unaware that it is a hybrid, you would never guess.

Even more remarkable is the fact that, two decades ago, numerous industry experts swore that increased fuel-economy standards would drive up the cost of automobiles while making them less exciting and less safe. This prediction has proven entirely false.

In reality, the opposite has occurred. Cars have become more fuel-efficient, more powerful, and measurably safer in all types of collisions. Additionally, the automotive industry is thriving.

My point is not to recommend this particular car, but to illustrate that regulation, including self-regulation, does not necessarily stifle technology and creativity. In this case, regulation has served as a catalyst for innovation, providing engineers and companies with the incentive to explore new technological directions that are now delivering significant benefits to both society and the companies that embraced the challenge.

**Applying the Same Principles to Secure Software**

I believe we should aim to provide the same kind of creative stimulus to the engineering of secure software that we have provided to the engineering of fuel-efficient cars. If we do, our innovative engineers can achieve similar results.

While I am not naive enough to think this will be an easy process or that it will result in perfectly secure systems, we can and must do much better, particularly in the area of critical infrastructure software. There is no reason to view security vulnerabilities as an inevitable disease that requires regular "flu shots." These vulnerabilities are engineering defects that, if left unchecked, can provide fertile ground for organized crime and a significant lever for groups or nations seeking to steal intellectual property or attack each other's critical infrastructures.

As engineers and computer scientists, we have a responsibility to act on our knowledge. I propose that we begin by creating a credible building code for software.

**Acknowledgments**

I thank Charles Payne and the ACSAC organizers for the invitation that led me to put these thoughts in print. I also thank Hilary Orman, Susan Landau, and Terry Benzel, organizers of the GREPSEC workshop, where I presented some initial ideas on this topic. Bill Scherlis, who chaired discussions on building codes at the 2012 NSF Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace Principal Investigators meeting, also provided valuable input. Comments from Jeremy Epstein and Christoph Schuba helped me broaden the coverage and sharpen the analysis. Marvin Michalsen, AIA, provided perspectives on building codes. All opinions and any remaining errors are my sole responsibility.
