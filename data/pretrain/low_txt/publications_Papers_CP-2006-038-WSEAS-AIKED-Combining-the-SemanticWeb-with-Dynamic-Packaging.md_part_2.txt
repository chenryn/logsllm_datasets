# Ontology and e-Tourism Application

## Ontology Creation
The development of an ontology-driven application typically begins with the creation of the ontology schema. Our ontology schema defines various classes, attributes, and relationships that encapsulate the business objects within the tourism and travel domain. 

### Conceptual Structure
- **Concepts**: Fishing and Hiking are sub-concepts of the broader concept Sport.
- **e-Tourism Ontology**: This ontology provides a structured view of the tourism world, organizing related information and concepts. It achieves integration and interoperability through a shared vocabulary and consistent meanings for terms.

### Ontology Population
Ontology population involves adding instance data (individuals) to the existing class structure. This can be done either by a computer or a human editor. In our case, the e-Tourism ontology instances are generated automatically by an instance generator. The ontology and its instances form a semantic knowledge base that integrates information from multiple external sources, including relational databases, flat files, XML files, and HTML web pages.

#### Key Questions Addressed
- **What**: What can a tourist see, visit, and do while staying at a tourism destination?
- **Where**: Where are the interesting places to see and visit located?
- **When**: When can the tourist visit a particular place?

## Inference and Query Layer
The query layer provides an interface to the e-Tourism knowledge base, which is formed by all the ontology instances. The query interface supports three distinct semantic query languages: RQL (RDF Query Language), RDQL (RDF Data Query Language), and Buchingae. These languages allow users to query ontology classes, navigate to subclasses, and discover resources directly classified under them.

### Example Query
The following RDQL query selects hotels with a cost lower than 60 euros:
```sql
SELECT ?x, ?c, ?z
WHERE
(?x rdf:type owl:Hotel),
(?x ex:cost ?c),
(?y ex:currency ?z)
AND ?z < 60
```

### Rule Engine
A variety of rule engines are available as open-source software, such as Jess, Algernon, SweetRules, and Bossam. We chose Bossam, a forward-chaining rule engine, because it supports OWL inferencing, integrates seamlessly with Java, and is well-documented and easy to use.

## Dynamic Packaging Layer
Dynamic packages are automatically created by the dynamic packaging engine. Our architecture includes not only the dynamic packaging engine but also a rule editor and a query editor. Using a rule management system allows us to extract and isolate dynamic packaging logic from procedural code, making it easier to handle frequent changes in tourism information.

### Rule Development
- **Rule Editor**: A component that provides an interface to the rule repository, supporting the creation and modification of packaging rules.
- **Packaging Rules**: Codified and stored in an integrated repository, providing a central point for definition and change, which drives dynamic package construction.

### SWRL and Buchingae
Rules are defined using SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) or Buchingae. For example, a Buchingae rule states that travelers who buy a travel package with a flight, hotel reservation, and car rental are eligible for a 10% discount on the final price.

## Conclusion
The success of the Semantic Web vision depends on the development of practical and useful semantic Web-based applications. Our contribution is the architecture of a Semantic Dynamic Packaging System based on semantic Web technologies like OWL, RQL, RDQL, and SWRL. This system semantically integrates and extracts heterogeneous data from tourism data sources, answers complex semantic queries, and carries out reasoning using explicit semantic rules. It provides an integrated environment where travel agents can easily create dynamic packages for their customers.
