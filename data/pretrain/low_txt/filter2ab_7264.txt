**ATT&CK ID:** M1022  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Restrict File and Directory Permissions

To enhance security, implement directory access controls to prevent unauthorized file writes to the search paths used by applications. This includes both the folders from which applications are executed and the standard dynamic library (dylib) folders. By restricting write permissions in these critical directories, you can reduce the risk of malicious modifications or the introduction of unauthorized code.
