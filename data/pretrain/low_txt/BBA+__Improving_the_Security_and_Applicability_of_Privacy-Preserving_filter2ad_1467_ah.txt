### 8.1.3 Concrete Range Proof

As previously mentioned, we aim to prove that \( w \in \{v, \ldots, N_{\text{max}}\} \). To fit the interval limits into the proof scheme, we need to shift the values. Let us define \(\eta \in [\eta_{\text{max}}]\) as \(\eta := \lfloor \log_q (N_{\text{max}} - v) \rfloor + 1\) and \(N := q^\eta - 1\). Here, \(N + 1\) is the smallest power of \(q\) greater than \(N_{\text{max}} - v\).

The following equivalence holds:
\[ w \in \{v, \ldots, N_{\text{max}}\} \]
\[ \Leftrightarrow N_{\text{max}} - w \in \{0, \ldots, N_{\text{max}} - v\} \]
\[ \Leftrightarrow N_{\text{max}} - w \in \{0, \ldots, N\} \cap \{N_{\text{max}} - v - N, \ldots, N_{\text{max}} - v\} \]
\[ \Leftrightarrow N + v - w \in \{0, \ldots, N\} \]

This can be expressed in terms of a base-\(q\) representation:
\[ \exists w_0', \ldots, w_{\eta-1}' \in \{0, \ldots, q-1\} : N_{\text{max}} - w = \sum_{j=0}^{\eta-1} w_j' q^j \]
\[ \Leftrightarrow \exists w_0'', \ldots, w_{\eta-1}'' \in \{0, \ldots, q-1\} : N + v - w = \sum_{j=0}^{\eta-1} w_j'' q^j \]
\[ (10) \]

In our instantiation of the BBA+ scheme, openings of commitments are elements from the implicit message space \(G_1\). Therefore, \(w\) does not directly become part of the witness but is mapped using an \(F(3)\) mapping \(W = \mathcal{G}(w_1)\). Equation (10) translates into a statement about the \(F(3)\)-mapped balance \(W \in G_1\):

\[ \exists w_0', \ldots, w_{\eta-1}' \in \mathbb{Z}_p : W = \prod_{j=0}^{\eta-1} \mathcal{G}^{w_j'} \]
\[ \exists w_0'', \ldots, w_{\eta-1}'' \in \mathbb{Z}_p : W = \mathcal{G}^{N + v - w} \]
\[ (11) \]
\[ (12) \]

These are multi-scalar multiplication equations (MSEs) and thus fit into our Groth-Sahai proof system. Note that in contrast to Equation (10), Equations (11) and (12) do not assert that \(w_j' \in \{0, \ldots, q-1\}\). Hence, the user must additionally prove that \(w_j'\) and \(w_j''\) are indeed valid digits.

For each digit \(i \in \{0, \ldots, q-1\}\), let \(\sigma_i := S.\text{Sgn}(\text{sksig}, \mathcal{G}^i_2)\) be a corresponding signature using signature scheme \(S\). The user then proves:

\[ \forall j \in \{0, \ldots, \eta - 1\} : S.\text{Vfy}(\text{pksig}, \mathcal{G}^{w_j'}, \sigma_{w_j'}) = 1 \land S.\text{Vfy}(\text{pksig}, \mathcal{G}^{w_j''}, \sigma_{w_j''}) = 1 \]
\[ (13) \]

This shows that the user knows a valid signature for each digit. Each of these expands into two power-product equations (PPEs) using the signature scheme from [1]. In summary, including a range proof in the BBA+ scheme increases the non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) of the verification protocol by 2 MSEs for correctness of representation and \(4\eta\) PPEs for correctness of the digits.

### 8.2 Fully Active Adversaries

In the security model described in Section 3.3, we consider adversaries that may arbitrarily deviate from the protocol. In the full version of the paper [22], we provide a comprehensive security model where the adversary can also eavesdrop on protocol executions of honest users in several security experiments.

However, even in this comprehensive model, the adversary does not control the network and cannot tamper with messages from honest parties; they are restricted to passive eavesdropping. Man-in-the-middle attacks are excluded by the model. While this is a realistic model for applications where the user and the operator (issuer, accumulator, and verifier) are in direct contact, it may be insufficient if communication is over a wide-area network.

We find it interesting to extend our model to include adversaries that can actively tamper with communication as a man-in-the-middle. However, extending our model and construction to such adversaries is left as future work.
