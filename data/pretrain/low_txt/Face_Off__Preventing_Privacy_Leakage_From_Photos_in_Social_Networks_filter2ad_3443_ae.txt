### User Opinions on Access Control Mechanisms

Approximately 35% of users expressed a neutral opinion regarding the adoption of fine-grained access control mechanisms. In most cases, negative responses were attributed to a false belief that current access control measures are effective. Other negative responses came from users who were not concerned about privacy issues associated with widely accessible photos. Users who adopted a neutral stance acknowledged the need for others to maintain their privacy but lacked a strong personal motivation to use such mechanisms. Interestingly, these users were also unaware of the true visibility of their photos. Conversely, 38.4% of participants immediately formed a positive opinion of online social networks (OSNs) implementing fine-grained access control. Notably, there was a significant shift in user opinions after introducing the problem of conflicting interests.

### Legislative and Privacy Concerns

European data protection agencies have pressured Facebook to remove the tag-suggestion feature due to privacy concerns over face recognition software processing uploaded photos without user consent [1, 12]. This led to the temporary disabling of the tag-suggestion mechanism and the deletion of biometric data for European users [2, 14]. Consequently, many believe that face recognition software will have limited adoption. However, active research is being conducted towards privacy-preserving face recognition [24, 36], suggesting that this technology may still be adopted by such services. Despite this, our paper does not address privacy concerns and legislation related to face recognition. Instead, it leverages automated face recognition to enhance user privacy.

### Related Work

#### User Behavior and Photo Sharing
Besmer et al. [18] studied user behavior regarding photo sharing applications, identifying reasons for tagging or untagging photos. They demonstrated a prototype that obfuscates faces to initiate discussions about user privacy and photo ownership. Their findings highlighted user concerns about image visibility and the lack of effective access control mechanisms. In a follow-up study [19], they presented a "negotiation" tool allowing tagged users to request that certain photos become inaccessible to specific individuals. However, the final decision remains with the photo uploader, which does not resolve conflicts of interest.

#### Rule-Based Access Control
Several works [20, 21, 29, 40] have explored rule-based access control. For example, [29] allows users to annotate photos with semantically meaningful tags and specify access control rules. The work in [40] uses previously uploaded photos and their access control rules to predict acceptable rules for new photos, adapting to user behavior. However, these approaches create complex rule sets and focus on photo-level access control.

#### Privacy-Preserving Systems
Al Bouna et al. [21, 20] developed a system for preserving privacy in multimedia objects, specifically photos. They designed a security model and toolkit using the SWRL language for content-based access control. Their prototype can hide faces but does not distinguish between access control and conflict resolution. Additionally, only the uploader can set rules, and a security administrator must resolve conflicting rules, which is impractical at the scale of an OSN.

#### Multi-Party Access Control
Thomas et al. [45] highlighted the lack of multi-party access control mechanisms for shared content in OSNs. They studied conflicting privacy settings and how these can reveal sensitive information. Their proposed approach, however, is too strict and reveals objects only to mutual friends. Other works [26, 27, 39] proposed multi-party mechanisms for collaborative access control policy specification, but these are enforced at the photo level, which cannot accommodate all depicted users' privacy preferences.

#### Cryptography-Based Solutions
Cutillo et al. [23] presented a cryptography-based face obfuscation mechanism for a decentralized OSN, Safebook. This mechanism, while innovative, is not applicable to existing OSNs due to its reliance on specific routing protocols. Our approach, in contrast, is designed for easy integration with existing social networks, leveraging widely available technological capabilities.

### Conclusions

In this work, we addressed the issue of conflicting interests arising from photo sharing in social networks. Current OSN designs limit users' control over the visibility of shared photos, often overriding individual privacy settings. We identified different scenarios where conflicts occur and conducted a case study to quantify privacy risks. We collected a large number of photos and tags to assess users' tagging behavior and determine the true visibility of shared photos.

We designed a fine-grained access control mechanism allowing depicted users to define the exposure of their own faces by setting preferred permissions. When a photo is requested, our mechanism determines which faces should be hidden or revealed based on the requesting user and presents a processed version of the photo. This mechanism can be implemented alongside existing access control mechanisms and operates efficiently. Our user study found that hiding users' faces is an effective measure for enhancing privacy in shared photos and revealed misconceptions about existing access control mechanisms.
