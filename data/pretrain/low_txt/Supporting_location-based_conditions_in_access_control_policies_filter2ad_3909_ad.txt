### Access Control Evaluation Process

The access control evaluation process is divided into three phases, each with specific conditions and rules.

#### Phase 1: Evaluation of Generic Conditions
Let \( A_g \subseteq A \) be the set of applicable rules where the subject expressions contain only generic conditions. If there exists a rule \( r \in A_g \) such that \( \text{subj\_expr}(r) \) evaluates to true, then access is granted, and the evaluation process ends.

**Example:**
- Suppose the subject expression of an applicable rule \( r \in A_g \) is \( (\text{user.Company} = \text{ACME} \land \text{user.Job} = \text{employee}) \).
- If the requestor is an employee of ACME, the subject expression evaluates to true, and access is granted.

#### Phase 2: Simplification and Evaluation of Location-Based Predicates
Let \( A_{lp} \subseteq A \) be the set of applicable rules where the subject expressions contain location-based predicates. For each rule \( r \in A_{lp} \), the Access Control Engine (ACE) simplifies \( \text{subj\_expr}(r) \) using propositional calculus. Specifically, the ACE first evaluates all generic conditions in the subject expression.

**Example:**
- Suppose the subject expression of an applicable rule \( r \in A_{lp} \) is \( (\text{user.Citizenship} = \text{EU} \land \text{inarea}(\text{sim}, \text{Venice})) \).
- If the requestor is Italian (a citizen of the EU), the residual subject expression becomes \( (\text{True} \land \text{inarea}(\text{sim}, \text{Venice})) \), which simplifies to \( \text{inarea}(\text{sim}, \text{Venice}) \).

This residual condition, which cannot be further simplified, is then evaluated by the ACE. For each predicate \( \text{pred\_name}(p_1, \ldots, p_n) \), the ACE determines the involved Location Service (LS) and calls the function \( \text{Solve}(\text{pred\_name}(p_1, \ldots, p_n), \text{LS}) \).

#### Phase 3: Final Access Control Decision
In the final phase, the outcomes of all evaluated conditions are combined to reach the final access control decision. The resolution of predicates in the subject expression can result in three possible values: True, False, or Undefined. The boolean expression outcome is determined using the classical truth tables of propositional connectives \( \lor, \neg, \land \) defined in 3-valued logic.

- **Undefined** \( \land \) **False** = **False**
- **Undefined** \( \lor \) **True** = **True**
- Other disjunctions or conjunctions involving Undefined, as well as the negation of Undefined, result in Undefined.

Access is granted if, for an applicable rule, the subject expression evaluates to True; otherwise, it is denied.

### Example
Consider Alice, a user with SIM number Alice-sim, requesting Read data access to the Mobile Network Console (MNC). Let \( P \) be the set of policies described in Table 2.

1. **Applicable Rules Retrieval:**
   - The set of applicable rules \( A \) contains authorizations 2 and 3, both of which fall in \( A_{lp} \).

2. **Simplification of Authorizations:**
   - Assume Alice’s active role is Admin and she is connected with a valid account.
   - The generic conditions in authorization 3 evaluate to False, making the whole authorization evaluate to False.
   - The generic conditions in authorization 2 evaluate to True, resulting in the residual condition:
     \[
     \text{local\_density}(\text{Alice-sim}, \text{Close By}, 1, 1) \land \text{velocity}(\text{Alice-sim}, 0, 3) \land \text{inarea}(\text{Alice-sim}, \text{Inf. System Dept.})
     \]

3. **Evaluation of Residual Condition:**
   - For each predicate in the residual condition, the function \( \text{Solve} \) is called.
     - \( \text{Solve}(\text{local\_density}(\text{Alice-sim}, \text{Close By}, 1, 1), \text{LS}) = \text{Undefined} \)
     - \( \text{Solve}(\text{inarea}(\text{Alice-sim}, \text{Inf. System Dept.}), \text{LS}) = \text{True} \)
     - \( \text{Solve}(\text{velocity}(\text{Alice-sim}, 0, 3), \text{LS}) = \text{True} \)

   - Combining these results: \( \text{Undefined} \land \text{True} \land \text{True} = \text{Undefined} \)
   - Therefore, access is denied.

### Related Work
The diffusion and reliability of mobile technologies provide a means to exploit location information for improving current access control systems. The definition of a Location-Based Access Control (LBAC) model is an emerging research issue. Some early mobile networking protocols incorporated the notion of linking the physical position of a terminal device and its capability to access network resources. Recent studies have focused on location-based information for monitoring users' movements in wireless networks and improving location tracking features. Other researchers have proposed architectures and operations for LBAC in local wireless networks, but these contributions were aimed at addressing security weaknesses rather than defining a general, protocol-independent model for LBAC.

### Conclusions
Our approach encapsulates time-dependency and uncertainty of location measurements as important features of location information in a small set of semantically uniform service level agreement (SLA) parameters based on the notions of confidence level and temporal validity of each access request. These parameters ensure consistent access decisions regardless of the available location technology and transient environmental conditions. We provided formal definitions of location-based predicates, discussed their management, evaluation, and enforcement, and proposed an architecture to integrate our LBAC evaluation with traditional identity-based access control. Our proposed architecture supports a broad variety of location-based policies and a rich set of predicates. We also presented a worked-out example of a LBAC policy applied to a relevant industrial scenario. Several open issues remain, particularly concerning the specification and enforcement of security and privacy constraints on location-based information.
