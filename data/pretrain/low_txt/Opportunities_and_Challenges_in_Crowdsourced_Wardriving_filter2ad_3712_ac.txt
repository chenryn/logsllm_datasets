### Differences Between Routers and RSSI Correlation

The variations in emitted power and the influence of obstacles on different routers necessitate a separate calculation of the correlation between distance and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) for each router. Our analysis reveals that approximately 35% of routers, with at least 50 observations, exhibit a statistically significant negative correlation between distance and RSSI, with an average correlation coefficient (\(\rho\)) of -0.36. Conversely, 16% of these routers show a positive correlation between RSSI and distance, with an average \(\rho\) of 0.32. All reported correlations are statistically significant, with a p-value less than 0.01.

### Response Rate as a Distance Proxy

We re-evaluated the response rate as a proxy for distance from the Access Point (AP), as initially suggested in [4]. The response rate at a given distance \(d\) is defined as the fraction of WiFi scans at distance \(d\) from the AP's location that report finding the AP. We selected a random subsample of 11,700 static APs, each with at least 50 observations. For each AP, we analyzed all scans recorded at varying distances \(d\) from 0 to 1,000 meters. The response rate at distance \(d\) was calculated as the fraction of scans in which the AP was detected. As shown in the right panel of Figure 6, the response rate decreases as the distance from the inferred location increases, with a stronger correlation than RSSI (\(\rho = -0.55\) for distances up to 100 meters). However, measuring the response rate requires multiple scans at the same distance, making it less suitable for real-time location estimation.

### Estimating User Locations

To estimate user locations using our database of AP locations, we explored four different methods:

1. **Mean Coordinates**: Ignoring RSSI, we calculate the mean latitude and longitude of all observed APs.
2. **Geometric Median**: Ignoring RSSI, we compute the geometric median of the observed APs.
3. **Mean Weighted by RSSI**: Each AP is assigned a weight based on its RSSI, with the weight defined as \( \text{RSSI} + 100.4 \).

We examined instances with varying numbers of observed APs, selecting 100 random instances between 0 and 30 observed APs. The left panel of Figure 7 shows the cumulative error distributions for these three methods. The geometric median approach performed best, followed closely by the mean weighted by RSSI. While there are slight differences in performance, all methods locate more than 50% of scans within 13 meters of the ground truth, 90% within 70 meters, and 95% within 120 meters.

In the right panel of Figure 7, we compare our best method (geometric median) with estimations from the Google Geolocation API. The median error is plotted as a function of the number of APs used for the estimation. Our approach performs slightly better, but the overall performance is similar. Google's crowd-sourced data, collected from a wide variety of uncalibrated hardware, may introduce more measurement noise compared to our consistent model.

### Applicability of the Localization Database

We identified 263,281 APs as static, constituting only 3.7% of the total 7.2 million unique APs observed. Revisiting the original dataset, we randomly selected 51 million scans and found that at least two of our static APs were visible in 73% of all scans, providing an average error of 15 meters for 73% of the observed WiFi scans. A median error of 15 meters means that certain applications, such as car navigation, cannot be solved using WiFi signals alone. However, there are several applications where the advantages outweigh the high positioning error. For example, using geolocated WiFi routers enables tracking mobile devices with sub-minute time resolution at low battery and data consumption costs. This allows for accurate measurements of time spent at each location and detection of location changes. Additionally, storing a lookup database on mobile devices enables positioning without internet access. Our database for the Greater Copenhagen area is only 9 MB, making it feasible to include in a mobile application for tourists.

### Summary

Efficiently determining the location of a mobile device is increasingly important. While GPS hardware is available, WiFi localization databases offer faster and more power-efficient solutions. Building such a database requires large-scale WiFi scan data over time, typically accessible only to major mobile OS vendors. In this work, we explored the opportunities and challenges in building a WiFi localization database using over 800 mobile devices. We found that the mobility of APs is a key challenge, with 30% of APs being non-static. Using only the static APs, we can provide location estimates for 73% of scans with a median accuracy of 15 meters. Overall, our results provide the largest-scale look at WiFi localization databases in the research community.
