### List of Accepted Community Names
- Specify whether to accept SNMP messages from any host or from a predefined list of hosts, identified by their IPv4 address or hostname.

### Security Tab
- **Figure B-8** illustrates the Security tab for the SNMP service.

### Evntcmd Tool
- The `Evntcmd.exe` tool can be used at the command prompt to configure SNMP traps based on events recorded in system logs. It also allows you to specify where trap messages are sent within an SNMP community.

### Abstract
- This appendix explains how the Computer Browser service works on computers running Microsoft Windows operating systems. It details how the service displays the list of workgroups and domains, as well as the servers within them, in the Network and Microsoft Windows Network windows and related windows in My Network Places. Understanding this service is crucial for network administrators to diagnose issues with the visibility of domains, workgroups, or server computers.

### Computer Browsing Overview
- The Computer Browser service in Windows maintains an up-to-date list of domains, workgroups, and server computers on the network and provides this list to client computers upon request.
- **Domain**: A grouping of computers that provide a centralized account database and security. This definition is distinct from its use in Active Directory, where a domain is a collection of computer, user, and group objects sharing a common directory database, security policies, and relationships.
- **Workgroup**: A logical grouping of computers that helps users locate shared resources like folders and printers. Workgroups do not offer the centralized user accounts and security provided by domains.
- **LAN Group**: Either a domain or a workgroup.

### Accessing the Network Resources
- **Windows XP-style Start Menu**:
  - Click Start, then My Network Places.
  - In My Network Places, click Entire Network.
  - In the Entire Network window, double-click Microsoft Windows Network.
- **Classic Windows Start Menu**:
  - Double-click My Network Places on the desktop.
  - In My Network Places, double-click Entire Network.
  - In the Entire Network window, double-click Microsoft Windows Network.
- The Microsoft Windows Network window will display a list of LAN groups.

### Browse List Distribution
- The browse list, which includes LAN groups and their servers, is distributed to automatically elected browse server computers. These servers reduce the need for all computers to maintain a complete list, thereby lowering network traffic.
- The browse list is separate from the list of computers in Active Directory. For example, when you click "Search Active Directory" in the Network Tasks pane of My Network Places, queries are performed against Active Directory, not the browse list.

### NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT)
- The Computer Browser service operates using NetBT broadcast and unicast messages. There is no support for computer browsing over IPv6. If NetBT is disabled, the Computer Browser service cannot function.
- For networks with NetBT disabled and using only DNS and Active Directory, you must use Active Directory to find computers.

### Remote Access Connections
- Computer browsing over remote access connections is aided by the NetBT proxy in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003, which is enabled by default for Routing and Remote Access on all interfaces not connected to the Internet.

- For more information about NetBT, see Chapter 11, "NetBIOS over TCP/IP," and Chapter 12, "Windows Internet Name Service Overview."

### Computer Browser Service Processes
- The Computer Browser service in Windows performs three main processes:
  - Collection of browsing information
  - Distribution of browsing information
  - Servicing of browse client requests

### Browsing Collection and Distribution
- **Master Browse Server**: Collects and maintains the browse list of available servers within its LAN group and a list of other LAN groups and their Master Browse Servers. It also distributes the browse list to Backup Browse Servers.
- **Backup Browse Server**: Receives a copy of the browse list from the Master Browse Server and distributes it to browse clients upon request.
- **Domain Master Browse Server**: The first domain controller to register the NetBIOS name of Domain[1B] becomes the Domain Master Browse Server. It synchronizes the browse list for Master Browse Servers in the domain located on remote subnets.

### Election Process
- Computers are designated as Master or Backup Browse Servers through an automatic election process. There is only one Master Browse Server per LAN group, and the number of Backup Browse Servers depends on the number of servers in the LAN group.

### Collection Process
- The Master Browse Server accumulates the following information:
  - A list of servers within its LAN group.
  - A list of other LAN groups.

### Distribution Process
- The Master Browse Server distributes the browse list to Backup Browse Servers through:
  - Local Master Announcement packets.
  - Browse list pull operations from the Master Browse Server to Backup Browse Servers.

### Servicing Browse Client Requests
- After the browse list is built and distributed, it can be used to service browse client requests, such as:
  - The list of servers within its LAN group.
  - The list of servers within another LAN group.
  - The list of shares on a server.

### Obtaining the List of Servers
- **Within its LAN Group**:
  - The browse client broadcasts a Get Backup List Request packet to the NetBIOS name LANGroup[1D].
  - The Master Browse Server responds with a list of Backup Browse Servers.
  - The client randomly selects a Backup Browse Server and requests the list of servers in its LAN group.
- **Within Another LAN Group**:
  - The client broadcasts a Get Backup List Request packet to the NetBIOS name LANGroup[1D].
  - The Master Browse Server for that LAN group responds with a list of Backup Browse Servers.
  - The client randomly selects a Backup Browse Server and requests the list of servers in the LAN group.

### Obtaining the List of Shares on a Server
- The client attempts to resolve the NetBIOS name for the Server service on the desired computer, creates a TCP session, NetBIOS session, and SMB session, and then requests a list of shares.

### Computer Browser Service on Windows Server 2008
- By default, the Computer Browser service is disabled on new installations and upgrades to Windows Server 2008. This can cause issues for domain controllers in the PDC FSMO role. To prevent this, configure the startup type for the Computer Browser service to Automatic and start the service. Additionally, ensure File and Printer Sharing is enabled in the Network and Sharing Center.

### Computer Browser Service Operation on an IPv4 Network
- The Computer Browser service relies on broadcast NetBIOS over TCP/IP packets, which are not forwarded by IPv4 routers. To facilitate browsing across an IPv4 network, the service uses WINS and Lmhosts file entries.
- Enabling NetBIOS broadcast forwarding on routers is discouraged due to increased broadcast traffic and potential browse server election conflicts.

### Browsing Situations
- **Domain Spanning an IPv4 Router**: Examines the collection and distribution process and the servicing of browse client requests for a domain spanning an IPv4 router.
