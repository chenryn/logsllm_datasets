### Summary of the System Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 2015-07-30 15:18:48 to 2015-07-30 16:12:05, provides detailed information about the interactions and events within a ZooKeeper server. The key activities include:

1. **Session Expiration and Termination:**
   - **Expiring Sessions:**
     - At 15:18:48, session `0x34ed9ac1c1e0065` expired due to a timeout of 20,000 milliseconds.
     - At 16:11:39, session `0x34ed9ac1c1e007f` expired due to a timeout of 10,000 milliseconds.
     - At 16:11:48, sessions `0x24ed9311942008e` and `0x34ed9ac1c1e007f` expired due to a timeout of 10,000 milliseconds each.
   - **Processed Session Terminations:**
     - At 15:38:12, session `0x24ed93119420094` was terminated.
     - At 16:00:22, session `0x34ed9ac1c1e0081` was terminated.
     - At 16:00:30, session `0x34ed9ac1c1e0080` was terminated.
     - At 16:11:48, sessions `0x34ed9ac1c1e007a` and `0x34ed9ac1c1e0078` were terminated.

2. **Socket Connections:**
   - **Accepted Socket Connections:**
     - At 15:24:39, the socket connection for client `/10.10.34.11:53857` with session ID `0x24ed93119420082` was closed.
     - At 15:35:06, socket connections were accepted from clients `/10.10.34.11:54078`, `/10.10.34.18:40006`, and `/10.10.34.40:47629`.
     - At 15:35:20, a socket connection was accepted from client `/10.10.34.11:54134`.
     - At 16:12:05, socket connections were established with clients `/10.10.34.32:39275` and `/10.10.34.36:45209`.

3. **Session Establishment:**
   - **Established Sessions:**
     - At 15:35:06, session `0x24ed9311942008c` was established with a negotiated timeout of 10,000 milliseconds for client `/10.10.34.18:40006`.
     - At 15:35:08, session `0x24ed93119420091` was established with a negotiated timeout of 10,000 milliseconds for client `/10.10.34.40:47629`.
     - At 16:12:05, sessions `0x24ed931194200a4` and `0x24ed931194200a7` were established with a negotiated timeout of 10,000 milliseconds for clients `/10.10.34.32:39275` and `/10.10.34.36:45209` respectively.

4. **End of Stream Exceptions:**
   - **Caught End of Stream Exceptions:**
     - At 15:34:30, 15:37:52, 15:41:43, and 16:11:39, end of stream exceptions were caught by the NIOServerCnxn.

### Key Observations:
- The ZooKeeper server is actively managing sessions, establishing new ones, and expiring or terminating others based on timeouts and other conditions.
- The NIOServerCnxn component is handling socket connections and occasionally encountering end of stream exceptions, which may indicate issues with client connections.
- The PrepRequestProcessor is responsible for processing session terminations, ensuring that resources are properly managed and released.

This summary provides a clear and structured overview of the log events, highlighting the key activities and components involved in the ZooKeeper server's operation.
