### Analytic 2: Remotely Launched Executables via Services
**CAR URL:** [https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2014-03-005](https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2014-03-005)  
**Type:** Behavioral  
**Data Sources:** Process Creation Events, Process Network Connection Events with Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Metadata

**Description:**
This analytic correlates data from multiple sensors to identify instances where an adversary uses the RPC functionality of Windows to remotely start the execution of an executable on a host. Such activity is identified by correlating an RPC connection to `services.exe` with a near-immediate process start event of `services.exe`.

**ATT&CK Coverage:**
- **Tactic:** Execution
  - **Technique:** New Service
  - **Technique:** Modifying Existing Service
  - **Technique:** Service Execution

### Analytic 3: User Login Activity Monitoring
**CAR URL:** [https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2013-10-001](https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2013-10-001)  
**Type:** Informational  
**Data Sources:** Login, Logout, and Remote Login Events (from Windows Event Logs)

**Description:**
Situational awareness analytics provide valuable information to analysts about when an incident occurs. This analytic uses Windows security logs to track user logon sessions, including both local and remote logon sessions. This is useful for establishing which user account(s) was responsible for, or impacted by, the compromise of a host. It also provides general user account logon patterns, which can be useful for advanced anomaly and behavioral analysis.

**ATT&CK Coverage:**
- **Tactic:** Defense Evasion
  - **Technique:** Legitimate Credentials
- **Tactic:** Lateral Movement
  - **Technique:** Remote Desktop Protocol

### Analytic 4: Server Message Block (SMB) Copy and Execution
**CAR URL:** [https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2013-05-005](https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2013-05-005)  
**Type:** Behavioral  
**Data Sources:** Process Creation Events, Network Flow Events with SMB Metadata

**Description:**
Adversaries commonly use the SMB Protocol to write malicious executables or scripts to a remote host that are then executed at a later time. This analytic looks for an SMB file write event (via file or network monitoring) and the corresponding process execution event.

**ATT&CK Coverage:**
- **Tactic:** Lateral Movement
  - **Technique:** Windows Admin Shares
  - **Technique:** Remote File Copy
- **Tactic:** Defense Evasion
  - **Technique:** Legitimate Credentials

### Analytic 5: Outlier Parents of cmd.exe
**CAR URL:** [https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2014-11-002](https://car.mitre.org/wiki/CAR-2014-11-002)  
**Type:** Anomaly/Outlier  
**Data Sources:** Process Creation Events

**Description:**
Some programs execute the Windows command shell frequently as part of their normal operation. Malicious actors commonly spawn command prompts from processes that do not normally spawn command prompts, either by using custom malware or by hijacking other processes. By identifying instances where a command prompt is started by a process that does not normally start command prompts, this kind of behavior can be observed.

**ATT&CK Coverage:**
- **Tactic:** Execution
  - **Technique:** Command Line Interface

### A.2 Sensors
During our research, a wide variety of different sensors were used to collect data in the living lab. Because most of the necessary data had to be collected from endpoint hosts, MITRE's sensing efforts focused on sensors that could be installed on endpoint systems. The endpoint tools or data sources currently in use include:

- **Windows Event Logs:**
  - Standard Windows logs from hosts, used for tracking user session information, including login attempts.
- **Sysmon [27]:**
  - A Microsoft Sysinternals tool that captures a variety of endpoint data, including process creation events and their associated command lines, network connection creation, driver loads, and dynamic linking library (DLL) module loads. It can also detect timestomping.
- **Autoruns [28]:**
  - A Microsoft Sysinternals tool that provides data relating to all programs scheduled to start automatically on a host. Configuring a program to automatically start is a common technique used by adversaries to achieve persistence.
- **Custom Endpoint Netflow Sensor:**
  - A MITRE-built endpoint network flow program that captures network connection flows and augments them with data from the end host, such as process ID. It also decodes portions of a session and enriches flow records with metadata.
- **Custom Event Tracing for Windows [29] Sensor:**
  - A MITRE-built sensor that fills several gaps in sensing. It primarily detects process injection (which can also be detected by the later versions of Sysmon), captures process creation and termination, file creation, and file deletion events for certain files and paths.
- **Computer Properties and Sensor Checks:**
  - Several times each day, every computer collects an informational snapshot of its current status, including network devices and configuration, hardware profile, disk utilization, memory utilization, last boot time, operating system information, and a list of all users who have logged on since the last boot. This data is primarily used in situational awareness analytics but can also enrich queries related to credential access to help determine which credentials may have been compromised. Additionally, there are periodic checks performed to return the status of all sensor services and executables to determine if they are running, stopped, or not present on each system.
