### Conclusion

Our findings indicate that, at least within the context of online anonymous marketplaces, commoditization is a more fragmented and less pervasive phenomenon than previously assumed. While we do observe growth in certain niches, many of the capabilities, systems, and resources seen in well-established value chains are not available. Additionally, there is no evidence of rapid growth, suggesting that the push towards commoditization is not as strong as some industry reports and other sources have suggested.

### Generalizability of Findings

We have measured and explained the trends in the commoditization of cybercrime on online anonymous markets. Our findings suggest that the trend towards commoditization may not be as comprehensive as claimed elsewhere. It is possible that less commoditized forms of B2B transactions, such as collaborations emerging from forums, play a significant role in areas where anonymous markets are absent. Furthermore, vertical integration likely remains crucial for more complex and dynamic forms of cybercrime.

### Implications for the Theory of Cybercrime Commoditization

There is a notable discrepancy between the reported profitability of criminal business models, such as ransomware (over $1 billion in 2016, according to the FBI) and DDoS services (one individual earning $385,000 with a booter service, as reported by British police), and the marginal markets for cybercrime commodities. The components necessary for a ransomware operation, such as malware, PPI, and cash-out services, appear to be available in these markets. However, the lack of strong growth in the trade of these commodities suggests that there are still bottlenecks in outsourcing critical parts of criminal value chains. Entry barriers for potential criminal entrepreneurs remain high.

Highly commoditized services, like booters, seem to attract primarily B2C activities—consumers targeting other consumers. A recent takedown of a RAT operation also indicated consumer consumption rather than B2B transactions. This does not diminish the relevance or danger of commoditization; rather, it highlights the importance of understanding where commoditization succeeds and fails. This knowledge can help identify which capabilities, services, and resources are difficult to obtain, thereby supporting the design of better disruption strategies for criminal business models.

The scarcity of certain commoditized cybercrime components suggests that they are either harder to produce or cannot function independently after a single sale. B2B services that require ongoing coordination among criminals fall short of full-fledged commoditization. The limited supply of these components indicates less scalable and potentially vulnerable elements in criminal value chains, which could be targeted by interventions. Previous work on interventions that target choke points has shown that they can have a measurable impact by raising transaction costs, rather than through a wholesale shutdown of the business model. For example, we found virtually no offerings for customer support services, which, for a ransomware scheme, might be the most vulnerable component. In contrast, police actions aimed at shutting down entire markets have had only modest effects on the overall trading of commoditized cybercrime. Understanding where commoditization is lagging behind can point to alternative disruption strategies.

**Output:** Set of listings per cybercrime categories

1. Select a random sample of 1,500 listings.
2. Manually classify the random sample into cybercrime categories.
3. Split the random sample into a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%).
4. For all listings:
   1. Balance the category using the SMOTE method.
   2. Remove English stopwords, URLs, punctuation, and digits.
   3. Lemmatize the text.
   4. Tokenize the text.
5. For each category in the training set:
   1. Train a Linear Support Vector Classifier using the balanced categories.
6. For each listing in the testing set:
   1. Classify the listing according to the trained LinearSVC.
7. Compute the confusion matrix.
8. For all listings:
   1. Classify the listing according to the trained LinearSVC.
