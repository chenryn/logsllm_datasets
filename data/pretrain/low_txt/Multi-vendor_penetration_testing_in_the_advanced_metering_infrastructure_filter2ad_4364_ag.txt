### Cost Savings from Avoided Truck Rolls
SMUD reported savings of over $8.6 million in the first 13 months following the deployment of its Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) system (April 2012 to June 2013). This was achieved by avoiding approximately 110,000 truck rolls, with an average cost per truck roll of around $77. From the project's initiation through March 31, 2014, SMUD saved approximately $31,787,600 in meter operation costs. The AMI system significantly reduced the need for manual meter operations, primarily through automated meter reading and automated service switching.

### Electric Vehicle Charging Pilot with Time-of-Use (TOU) Rates
SMUD conducted a residential electric vehicle (EV) program involving about 200 vehicles to better understand off-peak charging potential with TOU rate options. Two different TOU plans were tested: a Whole House Time-of-Use pricing plan and a Dedicated Meter Pricing Plan that was sub-metered. The latter included up to 12 Conservation Days when customers were signaled to reduce load during peak hours. Both pricing plans received high customer satisfaction.

### Evaluating Time-Based Rates with Customer Systems
SMUD implemented two Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) offers: one CPP-only plan and one that combined CPP and TOU pricing. Some customers enrolled in the program were provided with In-Home Displays (IHDs). The CPP rate was set at $0.75 per kilowatt-hour. Compared to the standard two-tiered rate, the TOU-CPP rate offered discounted off-peak pricing for 91% of summer hours, higher peak pricing for 8% of summer hours, and event pricing initiated in three-hour blocks, 12 times per summer, accounting for less than 1% of summer hours. IHDs were pre-commissioned and mailed to customers in the opt-in treatment group, enabling them to automatically connect with the customer’s meter upon setup.

SMUD's evaluation showed higher enrollment rates for opt-out approaches, without significant differences in drop-out rates or peak demand reductions. A benefit-cost analysis indicated greater net benefits and more favorable business cases for opt-out programs, as opt-in programs typically required higher budgets for marketing and recruitment.

### Customer Savings for Direct Load Control (DLC) Pilots with TOU Rates
SMUD compared bill impacts for customers on TOU-CPP rates with those on standard rates, both groups participating in a summer 2013 DLC pilot. TOU-CPP customers saved about 50% more than DLC pilot participants who chose to stay on standard rates, as shown in Figure 15. However, some TOU-CPP customers saw bill increases if they were unable to reduce or shift their electricity consumption. In 2012-2013, average summer bill savings exceeded $77 on the TOU-CPP rate for Summer Solutions participants, and customers using IHDs saw an average annual bill savings of just under $40 per year.

Based on these results, SMUD is consolidating all pricing tiers to produce a single flat rate for residential customers in 2018 and may consider transitioning all residential customers to default TOU rates thereafter.

### Testing Demand Load Control (DLC) Strategies
SMUD aimed to understand how different pre-cooling strategies, temperatures, and ceiling insulation affect demand responses. In 2012, three DLC strategies were tested: no pre-cooling, two hours of pre-cooling, and six hours of pre-cooling. These strategies were deployed randomly for more accurate evaluations. On average, no pre-cooling reduced energy use, while both two and six hours of pre-cooling increased it. Six hours of pre-cooling resulted in a reduction in overall energy use for participants with more ceiling insulation.

### Additional Case Studies

#### Glendale Water and Power (GWP)
- **Total Cost of AMI Implementation under SGIG:** $38,538,539
- **Number of Meters Installed:** 85,582
- **Average Cost per Meter:** $450
- **Communication Type:** Mesh Network
- **Backhaul Network:** Fiber
- **Enabled Features:** Remote Connect/Disconnect, Outage Reporting, Voltage Monitoring, Tamper Detection
- **AMI Integrated with:** Billing System, Customer Information System, Outage Management System, Distribution Management System

GWP mailed customized reports on energy consumption patterns and costs to about 46,000 households, resulting in energy savings of about 5,777 megawatt-hours (4.1%) in 2011-2012. The web portal launched in July 2012 saw a 50% increase in web traffic, allowing customers to view detailed usage information. GWP also offered in-home displays, a mobile app, and a web portal, which were well-received by customers.

#### Burbank Water and Power (BWP)
- **Total Cost of AMI Implementation under SGIG:** $29,590,416
- **Number of Meters Installed:** 51,928
- **Average Cost per Meter:** $570
- **Communication Type:** Mesh Network
- **Backhaul Network:** Fiber
- **Enabled Features:** Remote Connect/Disconnect, Outage Reporting, Voltage Monitoring, Tamper Detection
- **AMI Integrated with:** Billing System, Customer Information System, Operations Management System, Distribution Management System

BWP used AMI to reduce field service requests by 87%, from about 2,500 to about 300 per month, avoiding approximately 13,200 field trips between March 2013 and February 2014. This allowed BWP to reduce field service staff and improve customer satisfaction. BWP also integrated AMI with thermal energy storage systems for on-peak cooling, shifting large fractions of electricity use from on-peak to off-peak periods.

#### Sioux Valley Energy (SVE)
- **Total Cost of AMI Implementation under SGIG:** $7,184,756
- **Number of Meters Installed:** 27,641
- **Average Cost per Meter:** $260
- **Communication Type:** Power Line Carrier (PLC)
- **Backhaul Network:** Fiber
- **Enabled Features:** Remote Connect/Disconnect, Outage Reporting, Voltage Monitoring, Tamper Detection
- **AMI Integrated with:** Billing System, Customer Information System, Operations Management System, Distribution Management System

SVE installed a PLC network for two-way communications with AMI meters, improving distribution system operations and planning. SVE also reduced the amount charged to customers for collection trips by about 50% from 2007 to 2014. SVE’s 2011 CPP pilot program involved several thousand residential and agricultural households, with phone calls being the most common notification method, though text messages were preferred.

### Key Lessons and Conclusions
SGIG utility experiences during the AMI and customer system projects yielded several key conclusions:
- **Multiple Factors Affect the AMI Business Case:** Total AMI deployment costs and payback periods varied, influenced by factors such as full- and partial-scale implementations, enabling more smart meter features, and integrating AMI with more utility systems.
- **Cost Breakdown:** The total cost per meter ranged from $130 to $1,895, with the meter device cost representing only about 47% of the total cost per meter on average.
- **Integration and Customer Engagement Challenges:** Utilities faced challenges in integrating AMI with existing systems and engaging customers effectively.
