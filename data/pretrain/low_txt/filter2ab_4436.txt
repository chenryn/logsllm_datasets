**ATT&CK ID:** C0025  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack

In the 2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, the Sandworm Team created two new accounts: "admin" and "система" (System). These accounts were then associated with a domain that matched the local operational environment. The attackers subsequently granted these accounts elevated privileges, enabling them to carry out their malicious activities more effectively. [1]
