### NIST SP 800-161r1
**CYBERSECURITY SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR SYSTEMS AND ORGANIZATIONS**

This publication is available free of charge from: [https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1)

#### Introduction

Information and communications technology (ICT) and operational technology (OT) rely on a complex, globally distributed, extensive, and interconnected supply chain ecosystem. This ecosystem comprises geographically diverse routes and multiple levels of outsourcing, involving public and private sector entities such as acquirers, suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. These entities interact to research, develop, design, manufacture, acquire, deliver, integrate, operate, maintain, dispose of, and otherwise utilize or manage ICT/OT products and services. These interactions are shaped and influenced by a set of technologies, laws, policies, procedures, and practices.

The supply chain ecosystem has evolved to provide highly refined, cost-effective, and reusable solutions. Public and private sector entities have rapidly adopted this ecosystem, increasing their reliance on commercially available products, system integrator support for custom-built systems, and external service providers. This has increased the complexity, diversity, and scale of these entities.

In this document, the term "supply chain" refers to the linked set of resources and processes between and among multiple levels of an enterprise, each of which is an acquirer that begins with the sourcing of products and services and extends through the product and service life cycle.

Cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain refer to the potential for harm or compromise that may arise from suppliers, their supply chains, their products, or their services. These risks result from threats that exploit vulnerabilities or exposures within products and services that traverse the supply chain or threats that exploit vulnerabilities or exposures within the supply chain itself. Examples include:

1. A widget manufacturer whose design material is stolen in another country, resulting in the loss of intellectual property and market share.
2. A widget manufacturer that experiences a supply disruption for critical manufacturing components due to a ransomware attack at a supplier three tiers down in the supply chain.
3. A store chain that experiences a massive data breach tied to an HVAC vendor with access to the store chain’s data-sharing portal.

Note that SCRM and C-SCRM refer to the same concept for the purposes of NIST publications. In general practice, C-SCRM is at the nexus of traditional Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) and traditional Information Security. Organizations may employ different terms and definitions for SCRM outside of the scope of this publication. This publication does not address many of the non-cybersecurity aspects of SCRM.

Technology solutions provided through a supply chain of competing vendors offer significant benefits, including low cost, interoperability, rapid innovation, and product feature variety. Whether proprietary, government-developed, or open source, these solutions can meet the needs of a global base of public and private sector customers. However, the same factors that create such benefits also increase the potential for cybersecurity risks that arise directly or indirectly from the supply chain. These risks are often undetected and impact both the acquirer and the end-user.

For example, deployed software is typically a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product, which includes smaller COTS or open source software components developed or sourced at multiple tiers. Updates to software deployed across enterprises often fail to update the smaller COTS components with known vulnerabilities, including cases in which the component vulnerabilities are exploitable in the larger enterprise software. Software users may be unable to detect the smaller known vulnerable components in larger COTS software (e.g., lack of transparency, insufficient vulnerability management, etc.). The non-standardized nature of C-SCRM practices adds an additional layer of complexity, making it difficult for both the organization and members of its supply chain to consistently measure and manage cybersecurity risks.

In this document, the practices and controls described for Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) apply to both information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) environments and are inclusive of IoT. Similar to IT environments that rely on ICT products and services, OT environments rely on OT and ICT products and services, with cybersecurity risks arising from ICT/OT products, services, suppliers, and their supply chains. Enterprises should include OT-related suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers within the scope of their C-SCRM activities.

When engaging with suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers, agencies should carefully consider the breadth of the Federal Government’s footprint and the high likelihood that individual agencies may enforce varying and conflicting C-SCRM requirements. Overcoming this complexity requires interagency coordination and partnerships. The passage of the Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act (FASCSA) of 2018 aimed to address this concern by creating a government-wide approach to the problem of supply chain security in federal acquisitions by establishing the Federal Acquisition Security Council (FASC). The FASC serves as a focal point of coordination and information sharing and a harmonized approach to acquisition security that addresses C-SCRM in acquisition processes and procurements across the federal enterprise. In addition, the law incorporated SCRM into FISMA by requiring reports on the progress and effectiveness of the agency’s supply chain risk management, consistent with guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Council.

Note that this publication uses the term "enterprise" to describe Level 1 of the risk management hierarchy. In practice, an organization is defined as an entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within a larger enterprise structure (e.g., a federal agency or company). By this definition, an enterprise is an organization, but it exists at the top level of the hierarchy where individual senior leaders have unique risk management responsibilities [NISTIR 8286]. Several organizations may comprise an enterprise. In these cases, an enterprise may have multiple Level 1s with stakeholders and activities defined at both the enterprise and the organization levels. Level 1 activities conducted at the enterprise level should inform those activities completed within the subordinate organizations. Enterprises and organizations tailor the C-SCRM practices described in this publication as applicable and appropriate based on their own unique enterprise structure. There are cases in this publication in which the term "organization" is inherited from a referenced source (e.g., other NIST publication, regulatory language). Refer to NISTIR 8286, Integrating Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), for further guidance on this topic.

### 1.1 Purpose

Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) is a systematic process for managing exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain and developing appropriate response strategies, policies, processes, and procedures. The purpose of this publication is to provide guidance to enterprises on how to identify, assess, select, and implement risk management processes and mitigating controls across the enterprise to help manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. The content in this guidance is the shared responsibility of different disciplines with different SCRM perspectives, authorities, and legal considerations.

The C-SCRM guidance provided in this document is not one-size-fits-all. Instead, the guidance throughout this publication should be adopted and tailored to the unique size, resources, and risk circumstances of each enterprise. Enterprises adopting this guidance may vary in how they implement C-SCRM practices internally. To that end, this publication describes C-SCRM practices observed in enterprises and offers a general prioritization of C-SCRM practices (i.e., Foundational, Sustaining, Enabling) for enterprises to consider as they implement and mature C-SCRM. However, this publication does not offer a specific roadmap for enterprises to follow to reach various states of capability and maturity.

The processes and controls identified in this document can be modified or augmented with enterprise-specific requirements from policies, guidelines, response strategies, and other sources. This publication empowers enterprises to develop C-SCRM strategies tailored to their specific mission and business needs, threats, and operational environments.

### 1.2 Target Audience

C-SCRM is an enterprise-wide activity that should be directed as such from a governance perspective, regardless of the specific enterprise structure. This publication is intended to serve a diverse audience involved in C-SCRM, including:

- **Individuals with system, information security, privacy, or risk management and oversight responsibilities:** Authorizing officials (AOs), chief information officers, chief information security officers, and senior officials for privacy.
- **Individuals with system development responsibilities:** Mission or business owners, program managers, system engineers, system security engineers, privacy engineers, hardware and software developers, system integrators, and acquisition or procurement officials.
- **Individuals with project management-related responsibilities:** Certified project managers and/or integrated project team (IPT) members.
- **Individuals with acquisition and procurement-related responsibilities:** Acquisition officials and contracting officers.
- **Individuals with logistical or disposition-related responsibilities:** Program managers, procurement officials, system integrators, and property managers.
- **Individuals with security and privacy implementation and operations responsibilities:** Mission or business owners, system owners, information owners or stewards, system administrators, continuity planners, and system security or privacy officers.

### 1.3 Guidance for Cloud Service Providers

The external system service providers discussed in this publication include cloud service providers. This publication does not replace the guidance provided with respect to federal agency assessments of cloud service providers’ security. When applying this publication to cloud service providers, federal agencies should first use Federal Risk and Authorization Program (FedRAMP) cloud services security guidelines and then apply this document for those processes and controls that are not addressed by FedRAMP. For cloud services, FedRAMP is applicable for low-, moderate-, and high-impact systems [FedRAMP].

### 1.5 Background

C-SCRM encompasses activities that span the entire SDLC, including research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, disposal, and the overall management of an enterprise’s products and services. Enterprises should integrate C-SCRM within the SDLC as this is a critical area for addressing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. C-SCRM is the organized and purposeful management of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. C-SCRM requires enterprise recognition and awareness, and it lies at the intersections of security, suitability, safety, reliability, usability, quality, integrity, efficiency, maintainability, scalability, and resilience, as depicted in Figure 1-1. These dimensions are layers of consideration for enterprises as they approach C-SCRM and should be positively impacted by C-SCRM.

**Figure 1-1: Dimensions of C-SCRM**

- **Culture and Awareness:** The set of shared values, practices, goals, and attitudes of the organization that set the stage for successful C-SCRM. It includes a learning process that influences individual and enterprise attitudes and understanding to realize the importance of C-SCRM and the adverse consequences of its failure [NIST SP 800-16].
- **Security:** Provides the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of (a) information that describes the supply chain (e.g., information about the paths of products and services, both logical and physical); (b) information, products, and services that traverse the supply chain (e.g., intellectual property contained in products and services); and/or (c) information about the parties participating in the supply chain (anyone who touches a product or service throughout its life cycle).
- **Suitability:** Focused on the supply chain and the provided products and services being right and appropriate for the enterprise and its purpose.
- **Safety:** Focused on ensuring that the product or service is free from conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment [NIST SP 800-160 Vol.2].
- **Reliability:** Focused on the ability of a product or service to function as defined for a specified period of time in a predictable manner [NIST SP 800-160 Vol.2].
- **Usability:** Focused on the extent to which a product or service can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use [NIST SP 800-16].
- **Quality:** Focused on meeting or exceeding performance, technical, and functional specifications while mitigating vulnerabilities and weaknesses that may limit the intended function of a component or delivery of a service, lead to component or service failure, or provide opportunities for exploitation.
- **Efficiency:** Focused on the timeliness of the intended result delivered by a product or service.
- **Maintainability:** Focused on the ease of a product or service to accommodate change and improvements based on past experience in support of expanding future derived benefits.
- **Integrity:** Focused on guarding products and the components of products against improper modification or tampering and ensuring authenticity and pedigree.
- **Scalability:** The capacity of a product or service to handle increased growth and demand.
- **Resilience:** Focused on ensuring that a product, service, or the supply chain supports the enterprise’s ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions. Resilience includes the ability to withstand and recover from deliberate attacks, accidents, or naturally occurring threats or incidents.

#### 1.5.1 Enterprise’s Supply Chain

Contemporary enterprises run complex information systems and networks to support their operations. These systems and networks rely on a diverse and interconnected supply chain ecosystem. The supply chain ecosystem is composed of public and private sector entities that interact to research, develop, design, manufacture, acquire, deliver, integrate, operate, maintain, and dispose of ICT/OT products and services. These interactions are shaped and influenced by a set of technologies, laws, policies, procedures, and practices. The supply chain ecosystem has evolved to provide highly refined, cost-effective, and reusable solutions, leading to increased reliance on commercially available products, system integrator support, and external service providers. This increased reliance has also increased the complexity, diversity, and scale of these entities, thereby introducing new cybersecurity risks.
