## Abstract

In this thesis, we developed a systematic model of the code reuse attack space, where facts about attacks and defenses are represented as propositional statements in Boolean logic, and the possibility of deploying malware is a satisfiability instance. We use this model to analyze the defense configurations of a real-world system and to reason about hypothetical defense bypasses. We construct attacks based on these hypothetical bypasses and investigate the control flow graphs enforced by proposed Control Flow Integrity (CFI) systems using a graph search approach. Additionally, we develop several code reuse payloads that work within the control flow graph enforced by one proposed CFI defense. Our findings illustrate that the defenses we investigated are not effective in preventing real-world attacks.
