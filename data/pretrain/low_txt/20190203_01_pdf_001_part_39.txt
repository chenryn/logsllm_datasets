### 7.6.3 Adding Tables to a Publication

#### 7.6.3.1 Single-Master Replication (SMR)
For information on defining table filters on a publication table in a single-master replication system, refer to Section 5.2.3.

**Step 6 (For SMR only):**
1. Click the **Add Tables** button.
2. If the message "Publication Updated Successfully" appears, click the **OK** button.
3. If an error occurs, investigate and make the necessary corrections.

**Figure 7-71 - Successfully added tables to publication**

#### 7.6.3.2 Multi-Master Replication (MMR)
For information on defining table filters on a publication table in a multi-master replication system, refer to Section 6.2.3.

**Step 6 (For MMR only):**
1. Click the **Add Tables** button. The **Data Sync Check** dialog box will appear, warning you that synchronization replication is performed before the table is added.
2. If you wish to perform synchronization at a later time, click the **No** button.
3. If you wish to proceed with synchronization now, click the **Yes** button.
4. If the message "Publication Updated Successfully" appears, click the **OK** button.
5. If an error occurs, investigate and make the necessary corrections.

**Figure 7-72 - Data Sync Check dialog box**

**Step 7:**
1. The replication tree will display the newly added table under the **Publication** node.
2. Click the **Refresh** icon. The newly added table will appear under the **Subscription** nodes of a single-master replication system or the additional master nodes of a multi-master replication system.

**Figure 7-73 - Publication and subscription with added table**

**Step 8 (For MMR only):**
If you want to modify or view the default conflict resolution options assigned to the newly added table, follow the directions in Section 6.8.

**Step 9 (Optional):**
If you defined table filters on the newly added table and wish to use these filters on any subscriptions or master nodes, you must enable the filters on the table within the desired subscriptions or master nodes.
- For a single-master replication system, see Section 5.5.4 for directions on enabling table filters on a subscription.
- For a multi-master replication system, see Section 6.9 for directions on enabling table filters on a master node.

### 7.6.3.2 Removing Tables from a Publication
You can remove one or more tables from a publication, provided the following condition is met:
- The tables to be removed are not parent tables referenced by foreign key constraints of child tables that are not also selected for removal.

**Figure 7-74 - Entity relationship diagram of tables with foreign key constraints**

In the entity relationship diagram, the `emp` table has a foreign key constraint referencing the `dept` table, and the `jobhist` table has two foreign key constraints: one referencing the `emp` table and the other referencing the `dept` table.

If all three tables are in the publication, you can remove the following combinations of tables:
- Only the `jobhist` table.
- Both the `jobhist` table and the `emp` table.

**Step 1:**
Ensure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console. See Section 5.2.1 for directions on starting and registering a publication server.

**Step 2 (For SMR only):**
Select the **Publication** node of the publication from which you wish to remove tables.

**Step 2 (For MMR only):**
Select the **Publication** node under the **Publication Database** node representing the master definition node.

**Figure 7-75 - Selecting a publication from which to remove tables**

**Step 3:**
Open the **Remove Tables** dialog box in any of the following ways:
- From the **Publication** menu, choose **Update Publication**, then **Remove Tables**.
- Click the secondary mouse button on the **Publication** node, choose **Update Publication**, and then choose **Remove Tables**.
- Click the primary mouse button on the **Remove Publication Tables** icon.

**Figure 7-76 - Opening the Remove Tables dialog box by clicking the toolbar icon**

**Step 4:**
Use the **Remove Tables** dialog box as follows:
- **Remove:** Check the boxes next to the table names in the **Available Tables** list that you want to remove from the publication. If the publication is a snapshot-only publication, views will also appear in the **Available Tables** list.
- **Use Wildcard Selection:** Click this button to use wildcard pattern matching for selecting tables to be removed from the publication. See Section 7.1 for information on the wildcard selector.

**Figure 7-77 - Remove Tables dialog box**

**Step 5:**
Click the **Remove** button, then click the **Yes** button in the confirmation box.

**Figure 7-78 - Remove Tables confirmation**

**Step 6:**
Click the **OK** button in response to the "Tables Removed Successfully" message.

**Figure 7-79 - Successfully removed tables from publication**

The replication tree will now display without the removed table under the **Publication** node.

**Figure 7-80 - Publication minus removed table**

### 7.6.4 Updating the Set of Available Table Filters in a Publication
Once a set of available table filters has been defined in the publication of a single-master or multi-master replication system, the set can be updated by adding new filter rules, removing existing filter rules, or modifying existing filter rules.

**Note:**
- See Section 2.2.12.3 for table setup requirements for a log-based replication system and general restrictions on the use of table filters.
- See Section 5.2.3 for information on using table filters in a single-master replication system and Section 6.2.3 for a multi-master replication system.

**Updating the set of available table filters in a publication has the following implications:**
- After adding new filter rules to a publication, you must enable these new filter rules on the subscriptions or master nodes where you want them to take effect. See Section 5.5.4 for enabling filter rules on a subscription and Section 6.9 for enabling filter rules on a master node.
- After removing existing filter rules from a publication, the removed filter rules are automatically deleted from any associated subscription or master node where they were enabled. No further action is needed.
- After modifying existing filter rules (e.g., changing the filter name or filter clause), the modifications are automatically applied to any subscriptions or master nodes where the filter rules were enabled. No further action is needed.

After updating the set of available table filters in the publication and enabling or disabling the filter rules on the target subscriptions or master nodes, a snapshot replication should be performed on any affected subscription or master node to ensure consistency with the current set of filter rules.

**Steps to update the set of available filter rules in a publication:**

**Step 1:**
Ensure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console. See Section 5.2.1 for directions on starting and registering a publication server.

**Step 2 (For SMR only):**
Select the **Publication** node of the publication in which you wish to update the set of available table filters.

**Step 2 (For MMR only):**
Select the **Publication** node under the **Publication Database** node representing the master definition node.

**Figure 7-81 - Selecting a publication in which to update the set of available table filters**

**Step 3:**
Open the **Update Filters** dialog box in any of the following ways:
- From the **Publication** menu, choose **Update Publication**, then **Update Filters**.
- Click the secondary mouse button on the **Publication** node, choose **Update Publication**, and then choose **Update Filters**.

**Figure 7-82 - Opening the Update Filters dialog box**

**Step 4:**
The set of all available filter rules defined in the publication will be listed under the **Table Filters** tab.

**Figure 7-83 - Set of all available filter rules**

- To add a new filter rule, select the table or view from the **Table/View** drop-down list and click the **Add Filter** button. Fill in the information in the dialog box that appears. (See Section 5.2.3 for more details on adding individual filter rules in a single-master replication system and Section 6.2.3 for a multi-master replication system.)
- To remove a filter rule, highlight the filter rule and click the **Remove Filter** button.
- To modify the filter name or filter clause of a filter rule, double-click on the cell and enter the desired changes.

When satisfied with the updated set of available table filters, click the **Update** button.

**Step 5:**
A confirmation box will appear with a warning message and a recommendation to perform a snapshot replication on any subscription or master node where you intend to enable the change in filtering criteria.

**Figure 7-84 - Change filter rule confirmation**

- Click the **Ok** button in the confirmation box to proceed with the update to the filter rules.
- Click the **Cancel** button to return to the **Filter Rules** tab if you wish to modify your filter rule updates.

**Step 6:**
You may selectively enable any new filter rules to the corresponding tables of the associated subscriptions or master nodes. See Section 5.5.4 for enabling table filters on a subscription and Section 6.9 for enabling table filters on a master node.

### 7.6.5 Validating a Publication
Once a publication is created, do not directly change the definitions of the tables belonging to the publication. Doing so may cause a failure during the replication process. Examples of table definitions that must not be altered include:
- Adding or removing columns to a table
- Renaming columns
- Changing the data types of columns
- Changing the lengths of columns
- Changing a not nullable column to nullable or vice versa
- Adding or removing uniqueness constraints
- Adding or removing check constraints

In a single-master replication system, xDB Replication Server does not propagate table definition changes to the subscription tables once the subscription tables are created. Rows that may be allowed in an altered publication table may be illegal in the unaltered subscription table and will cause an error during replication.

Similarly, in a multi-master replication system, table definition changes are not propagated from one master node to another except when a new master node is added, and you choose to replicate the schema definition from the master definition node.

Additionally, for synchronization replication with the trigger-based method, triggers are generated on the publication tables that use certain attributes of these tables. If the table definition is changed, the trigger may no longer function properly.

**Note:**
- Do not change the triggers generated by xDB Replication Server. If it becomes necessary to regenerate the triggers, you must remove the associated publication and then recreate the publication.
- Certain table definition changes can be made and propagated by xDB Replication Server using the DDL change replication feature. See Section 7.8 for information on the DDL change replication feature.

If you do not use the DDL change replication feature, the following general steps must be taken if table definition changes are made:

**Single-Master Replication System:**
- If changes were made to the definitions of one or more publication tables, the resolution must be handled on a case-by-case basis. In the worst-case scenario, the subscription and publication must be removed and recreated as follows:
  1. Remove the subscription associated with the publication. See Section 5.5.5 for directions to remove a subscription.
  2. Remove the subscription tables from the subscription database using SQL `DROP TABLE` statements.
  3. Remove the publication. See Section 7.6.6 for directions to remove a publication.
  4. Re-add the publication. See Section 5.2.3 for directions to add a publication.
  5. Re-add the subscription. See Section 5.3.3 for directions to add a subscription.

**Multi-Master Replication System:**
- If changes were made to the definitions of one or more publication tables on one or more master nodes, the resolution involves:
  1. Ensure the table definitions are updated on all master nodes so that they are identical, or update the table definition on the master definition node so it can be replicated to the other master nodes.
  2. Recreate the publication database definitions of the master nodes.
  3. Remove the publication database definitions of all master nodes except for the master definition node. See Section 7.6.7 for directions to remove a publication database definition.
  4. Remove the publication. See Section 7.6.6 for directions to remove a publication.
  5. Remove the publication database definition of the master definition node. See Section 7.6.7 for directions to remove a publication database definition.
  6. At this point, all triggers, shadow tables, and metadata have been removed from the master nodes.
  7. With respect to the publication table definitions, you can either:
     - Update the table definitions on all master nodes so that they are identical.
     - Assume the table definitions on the master definition node are up-to-date and delete the out-of-date table definitions on all other master nodes.
  8. Re-add the publication database definition for the master definition node. See Section 6.2.2 for directions to add the master definition node.
  9. Re-add the publication. See Section 6.2.3 for directions to add a publication.
  10. Re-add additional master nodes. See Section 6.3 for directions to add an additional master node. When creating a master node, uncheck the **Replicate Publication Schema** check box if you have already created the table definitions on all master nodes. Check the **Replicate Publication Schema** check box if you want to propagate the table definitions from the master definition node to all other master nodes. A snapshot reloads the master node tables from the master definition node.

### 7.6.5.1 Validating a Single Publication
xDB Replication Server provides a way to verify that certain characteristics of publication tables have not been altered since the publication was created.

**Note:**
- This validation feature is only available for publications using the trigger-based method of synchronization replication. It is not available for publications using the log-based method of synchronization replication.

The validation operation can check for the following types of table modifications:
- Addition of columns to a table
- Removal of columns from a table
- Renaming of columns

**Note:**
- In a multi-master replication system, publication tables in only the master definition node are validated. The validation operation does not check if table definitions have changed in other master nodes.

**Steps to validate a single publication:**

**Step 1:**
Ensure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication you wish to validate is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console. See Section 5.2.1 for directions on starting and registering a publication server.

**Step 2 (For SMR only):**
Select the **Publication** node of the publication you want to validate.

**Step 2 (For MMR only):**
Select the **Publication** node under the **Publication Database** node representing the master definition node.

**Step 3:**
From the **Publication** menu, choose **Validate Publication**. Alternatively, click the secondary mouse button on the **Publication** node and choose **Validate Publication**.

**Figure 7-85 - Validating a selected publication**

**Step 4:**
- If the message "All Schema of Published Tables in Publication 'publication_name' Are Up-To-Date" appears, click the **OK** button.
- If an error appears, determine which tables were changed and what changes were made to the table definitions. These issues need to be resolved on a case-by-case basis as discussed earlier in this section.

**Figure 7-86 - Successful validation of all tables in the selected publication**

### 7.6.5.2 Validating All Publications
All publications under a single **Publication Database** node can be validated in one operation.

**Note:**
- This validation feature is only available for publications using the trigger-based method of synchronization replication. It is not available for publications using the log-based method of synchronization replication.
- In a multi-master replication system, publication tables in only the master definition node are validated. The validation operation does not check if table definitions have changed in other master nodes.

**Steps to validate all publications:**

**Step 1:**
Ensure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publications you wish to validate is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console. See Section 5.2.1 for directions on starting and registering a publication server.

**Step 2 (For SMR only):**
Select the **Publication Database** node under which you want to validate all publications.

**Step 2 (For MMR only):**
Select the **Publication Database** node representing the master definition node.

**Step 3:**
From the **Publication** menu, choose **Validate All Publications**. Alternatively, click the secondary mouse button on the **Publication Database** node and choose **Validate All Publications**.

**Figure 7-87 - Validating all publications subordinate to a selected publication database**

**Step 4:**
- If there were no modified tables, click the **OK** button.
- If there were modified tables, a list of publications that contain the modified tables will be displayed. Determine which tables were changed and what changes were made to the table definitions. These issues need to be resolved on a case-by-case basis as discussed earlier in this section.
