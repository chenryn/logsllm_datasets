### 2.3 Unified Services Theory

#### 2.3.1 Production and Consumption Processes
A production process transforms inputs into outputs. Inputs are resources available for production, typically provided by the producers who own the production processes. In service processes, consumers also provide or make available input resources, which can include their time, information, or property. The output is the result of the production process, and consumers select these outputs to satisfy their needs. The extraction of value, which is the satisfaction of consumers' needs, occurs in consumption processes.

A key concept, though not explicitly shown in the concept map, is the bidirectional interaction between consumers and producers. Consumers influence producers by providing production inputs, while producers influence consumers by acting on those inputs.

#### 2.3.2 Service Process Versus Service as Process
Integrating the concept maps of Service-Dominant Logic and Unified Services Theory is challenging due to their fundamentally different views of service. In Service-Dominant Logic, service is defined as a process, but this is not the same as the service process in the Unified Services Theory, which has a more restricted meaning and distinguishes between service and non-service situations (a distinction that does not exist in Service-Dominant Logic).

In Service-Dominant Logic, service requires co-creation between the producer/provider and consumer/beneficiary. The acts of the service provider and beneficiary may overlap completely, partially, or be entirely independent in space and time. This means that the resource integration and resulting value capture by the beneficiary can occur long after and in a different location from the provider's activities. This scenario aligns with the consumption process in the Unified Services Theory, where consumers can extract value from outputs of non-service production processes without interacting with the producer.

However, for a production process to qualify as a service process, it must involve consumer inputs, implying some degree of overlap in time and space between producer and consumer activities. As noted in [18], this interaction does not necessarily require co-production; the provision of the consumer's labor is just one type of consumer input.

#### 2.3.3 From Service Process to Service Exchange
The notion of value as satisfying needs in the Unified Services Theory is similar to the concept of value-in-use in the Service-Dominant Logic. Both theories agree that the consumer/beneficiary determines and captures the value. Resource integration in the Service-Dominant Logic and value extraction to satisfy needs in the Unified Services Theory are, therefore, similar. Value can serve as an anchor point for integrating both concept maps.

In the Unified Services Theory, consumers and producers are roles of actors in the Service-Dominant Logic, and inputs in the Unified Services Theory are resources in the Service-Dominant Logic. Given our goal of creating a conceptual model for a white-box service description language, we start the integration from the Unified Services Theory, which provides more detail on the "internals" of service. The integrated concept map should allow for multiple interpretations of concepts to co-exist.

**Figure 2.3: Integrated Concept Map of the Unified Services Theory and the Service-Dominant Logic**

Additions from the Service-Dominant Logic include the concepts of service, value co-creation, and value proposition. The distinction between operant and operand resources is also added. For example, a consumer providing labor to the service process (co-production) would be considered an operant resource applied in the service process. The concept of service exchange, not covered in the Unified Services Theory, is also introduced. A further elaboration of the exchange nature of service is provided in Section 2.5, where we introduce the Resource-Service-System model. The extension with concepts from the Service-Dominant Logic broadens the scope of the Unified Services Theory's service processes to include service exchanges.

### 2.4 Work System Metamodel

#### 2.4.1 Overview
The Work System Metamodel [4] is an extension of the Work System Theory [1]. The Work System Theory defines a work system as a system in which human participants and/or machines perform work (processes and activities) using information, technology, and other resources to produce specific products/services for internal and external customers. Services are acts performed to produce outcomes for the benefit of others. The Work System Framework can be used to describe and analyze work systems, including service systems. While the Work System Framework provides summary-level descriptions, the Work System Metamodel offers a more detailed operational view.

#### 2.4.2 Work System Metamodel Concepts
The main concepts of interest in the Work System Metamodel are shown in **Figure 2.4**. A service system is a work system where work is performed for the benefit of internal or external customers. The benefits for internal customers are distinct from performing work activities within the service system itself. The service system contains activities that use resources and produce products/services. Resources can be technological, informational, human, or other types. The term product/service refers to a bundle of tangible and intangible acts and outcomes, which can be more goods-like or services-like. Work System Theory recognizes the traditional distinction between goods and services but does not consider it crucial for understanding service systems.

Service system activities are performed by actor roles, which can be automated agents, non-customer participants (e.g., employees), or customer participants (in cases of co-production). Products/services may be used as resources for other activities within the same service system, but at least one product/service produced by an activity contributes to a product/service for the customer, facilitating the creation of value for the customer.

**Figure 2.4: Concept Map of the Work System Metamodel (Simplified)**

#### 2.4.3 From Service Process to Service System
Comparing the Work System Metamodel with the Unified Services Theory, the distinction between provider service systems and customer work systems is similar to that of production and consumption processes in the Unified Services Theory. Although not shown in **Figure 2.4**, the Work System Metamodel includes the concept of (business) process when two or more service system activities are sufficiently interrelated and sequential. Thus, production and consumption processes are part of the provider and customer work systems, respectively, and contain work system activities.

A work system perspective allows for a more detailed description of Unified Services Theory processes, showing that the outputs of production process activities might be used as inputs for other activities within the same or different production processes. It also highlights the various resources used as inputs in individual production process activities, whereas the Unified Services Theory focuses on different kinds of consumer inputs into the overall service process.

#### 2.4.4 Reconciling Value Co-Creation Definitions
The Work System Metamodel helps bridge the Unified Services Theory and the Service-Dominant Logic. The service provided by the provider service system facilitates value creation in the customer work system, similar to the output of production processes selected for consumption processes in the Unified Services Theory. Customer participation in service system activities (co-production) is optional, making the absence of a distinction between service and non-service systems in the Work System Metamodel similar to the Service-Dominant Logic, where all economic activity is service.

The definition of service in the Work System Metamodel is very similar to that in the Service-Dominant Logic. However, the view of value co-creation is more restrictive in the Work System Metamodel, requiring simultaneous time and location for provider and customer activities, while it is strictly required in the Service-Dominant Logic. The Work System Metamodel employs a more narrow form of co-production, but the service system produces a "service as a process" that facilitates value creation by customers/consumers.

### 2.5 Resource-Service-System Model

#### 2.5.1 Overview
The Resource-Service-System Model [15, 14] interprets the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) model of economic exchange [5] according to the Service-Dominant Logic. In REA, economic exchange results from the reciprocal actions (economic events) of independent entities (economic agents) that provide each other with the resources they control (economic resources).

#### 2.5.2 Resource-Service-System Model Concepts
Rooted in Accounting, REA uses the traditional economic classification of products as goods and services, where services are a type of resource exchanged between economic agents. This means that a service resource (e.g., consulting service) and the event that transfers this resource from a providing agent to a receiving agent (e.g., contracting and executing the consulting service) are explicitly distinguished, unlike in the Service-Dominant Logic, where the consulting process is the service.

The Resource-Service-System Model replaces the REA notion of economic resource with the Service-Dominant Logic's operant/operand resource, the REA notion of economic event with the Service-Dominant Logic's notion of service (operant resources acting upon or with operand resources), and the REA notion of economic agent with that of a service system entity. The latter concept is inspired by systems thinking in Service Science, where service systems are seen as supra-systems composed of sub-systems (service system entities) that improve their state through service exchange.

As dynamic configurations of resources, service system entities have the means to engage in service exchanges with other entities. Based on the REA axiom of economic reciprocity, the Resource-Service-System Model posits that service exchange is the reification of the dual relationship between economic reciprocal events, described as a series of actions and interactions undertaken by service system entities. **Figure 2.6** shows that a service exchange is composed of service system interactions, described by an interaction episode [11], representing a series of activities leading to a certain outcome or interaction episode type.
