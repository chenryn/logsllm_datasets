Aptana Studio has been my primary Python IDE for several years, and I have enjoyed much success with it. However, recently, I encountered an issue where Aptana Studio no longer recognizes any of the PyDev projects I created previously. This problem started after I installed a recent update to the IDE.

To resolve the issue, I tried uninstalling and then reinstalling the latest version of Aptana Studio from their official website, but the problem persisted. I also updated Java, suspecting a possible incompatibility between Java versions, but that did not help either.

Interestingly, the latest version of Eclipse works fine, and Aptana seems to function correctly for all other features except for PyDev (Python). I am currently using Windows 8. Has anyone else experienced this issue and found a solution?

**Update:**
Upon revisiting the Aptana website, I downloaded Aptana Studio 3, build: 3.4.2.201308081805, which works without any issues. However, version 3.5.0 still does not seem to support Python development at the moment.
