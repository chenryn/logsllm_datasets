### Configuring LDAP Directory Settings

**Custom Port Configuration:**
The "Use custom port" option allows you to specify a port number other than the standard ports for LDAP connections. The default ports are 389 for non-SSL and 636 for SSL.

**Managing Directory Access**

**Configuring LDAP Searches and Mappings:**
Directory Access enables you to edit the mappings, search bases, and search scopes that determine how Mac OS X locates specific data items in an LDAP directory. These settings can be adjusted separately for each LDAP directory configuration listed in Directory Access. Each configuration specifies how Mac OS X accesses data in an LDAPv3 or LDAPv2 directory.

- **Record Type Mapping:** You can map each Mac OS X record type to one or more LDAP object classes.
- **Attribute Mapping:** For each record type, you can also map Mac OS X data types (attributes) to LDAP attributes.
- **Search Base and Scope:** You can set the LDAP search base and scope to define where Mac OS X looks for a particular record type in the LDAP directory.

**Important Note:**
When mapping Mac OS X user attributes to a read/write LDAP directory domain, ensure that the LDAP attribute mapped to `RealName` is not the same as the first attribute in the list of LDAP attributes mapped to `RecordName`. For example, if `cn` is mapped to `RealName`, it should not be the first attribute mapped to `RecordName`. If this condition is not met, issues may arise when editing the full name or the first short name in Workgroup Manager.

For detailed specifications of Mac OS X record types and attributes, refer to Appendix A, "Mac OS X Directory Data."

**Editing Search Bases and Mappings for an LDAP Server:**
1. In Directory Access, click on **Services**.
2. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the administrator's name and password.
3. Select **LDAPv3** from the list of services, then click **Configure**.
4. If the server configurations list is hidden, click **Show Options**.
5. Select a server configuration from the list and click **Edit**.
6. Click on **Search & Mappings**.
7. Choose the mappings to use as a starting point, if any. Use the "Access this LDAPv3 server using" pop-up menu to select a mapping template or choose **Custom** to start without predefined mappings. Alternatively, click **Read from Server** to edit the mappings currently stored in the LDAP directory server.
8. Add or modify record types and their search bases as needed:
   - To add record types, click the **Add** button below the **Record Types and Attributes** list, select **Record Types**, choose one or more record types, and click **OK**.
   - To change the search base of a record type, select it in the **Record Types and Attributes List**, click the **Search base** field, and edit the search base.
   - To remove a record type, select it and click **Delete**.
9. Add, modify, or remove mappings for record types:
   - To add a mapping, select the record type, click the **Add** button below **Map to __ items in list**, and enter the name of an object class from the LDAP directory.
   - To change a mapping, double-click the LDAP object class in the **Map to __ items in list** and edit it.
   - To remove a mapping, select the record type, click the LDAP object class, and click **Delete**.
10. Add, modify, or remove attributes and their mappings:
    - To add attributes, select the record type, click the **Add** button, select **Attribute Types**, choose one or more attribute types, and click **OK**.
    - To add a mapping for an attribute, select the attribute, click the **Add** button below **Map to __ items in list**, and enter the name of an attribute from the LDAP directory.
    - To change a mapping for an attribute, double-click the item in the **Map to __ items in list** and edit the item name.
    - To remove a mapping for an attribute, select the attribute, click the item, and click **Delete**.
    - To reorder attributes, drag them up or down in the list.
11. Click **Write to Server** to store the mappings in the LDAP directory. Enter the search base, distinguished name of an administrator, and password. For Open Directory LDAP servers, the correct search base is `cn=config,` (where  is the server’s search base suffix, such as `dc=example,dc=com`).

**Mapping Config Record Attributes for LDAP Directories:**
If you want to store information for managed Mac OS X users in an LDAP directory, ensure that the following attributes of the Config record type are mapped: `RealName` and `DataStamp`. Failing to map these attributes will result in an error message when using Workgroup Manager to change a user record in the LDAP directory.

**Editing RFC 2307 Mapping to Enable Creating Users:**
Before using Workgroup Manager to create users on a non-Apple LDAP directory server with RFC 2307 (UNIX) mappings, you must edit the mapping of the Users record type.

**Preparing a Read-Only LDAP Directory for Mac OS X:**
To allow a Mac OS X computer to get administrative data from a read-only LDAP directory, the data must be in the required format. Modify the LDAP directory’s object classes and attributes as necessary. For detailed specifications, see Appendix A, "Mac OS X Directory Data."

**Populating LDAP Directories with Data for Mac OS X:**
After configuring access and setting up data mapping, you can populate the LDAP directories with records and data using Workgroup Manager. This includes defining user and group records, share points, and computer lists.

**Accessing an Active Directory Domain:**
You can configure a Mac OS X server or computer to access an Active Directory domain on a Windows 2000 or Windows 2003 server. The Active Directory plug-in in Directory Access allows basic user account information to be accessed without schema modifications. It supports multi-domain authentication, replication, and failover.

**Configuring Access to an Active Directory Domain:**
1. In Directory Access, click on **Services**.
2. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the administrator's name and password.
3. Select **Active Directory** from the list of services, then click **Configure**.
4. Enter the DNS names of the servers hosting the Active Directory forest and domain.
5. Enter the Computer ID, which is the name assigned to the computer in the Active Directory domain.
6. Click **Bind**, authenticate, and click **OK**.
7. Optionally, set advanced options:
   - **Cache last user logon for offline operation:** Enables offline credentials.
   - **Authenticate in multiple domains:** Allows users from any domain within the forest to authenticate.
   - **Prefer this domain server:** Specifies the preferred Active Directory server.
   - **Map UID to attribute:** Maps the UID to an attribute in the Active Directory schema.
   - **Allow administration by:** Specifies groups allowed to perform administrative tasks on the computer.

**Enabling or Disabling Active Directory Credential Caching:**
You can enable or disable the use of offline authentication credentials from an Active Directory domain using Directory Access.

**Specifying a Preferred Active Directory Server:**
You can specify the DNS name of the preferred Active Directory server using Directory Access.

**Mapping the UID to an Active Directory Attribute:**
You can map the UID to an attribute in an extended Active Directory schema using Directory Access.

**Changing the Active Directory Groups That Can Administer the Computer:**
You can grant administrator privileges to groups of user accounts accessed by the Active Directory plug-in using Directory Access.
