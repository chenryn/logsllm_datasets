## Description
I am using Celery 4.3, and according to its documentation, class-based tasks are not automatically registered (or autodiscovered) and must be registered manually: 
[Documentation Link](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/3.0/whatsnew-4.0.html#the-task-base-class-no-longer-automatically-register-tasks).

However, in my case, all class-based tasks are being registered automatically. After upgrading to Celery 5.1.*, the class-based tasks are no longer being registered. In which version was this feature exactly removed?

## Suggestions
- Clarify the version in which the automatic registration of class-based tasks was removed.
- Provide guidance on how to manually register class-based tasks in the current version.
