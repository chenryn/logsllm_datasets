# Impact of Local IT Infrastructure on Tracking Flows

The role of local IT infrastructure in confining tracking flows within national borders is a critical factor. In Fig. 12, we illustrate the confinement of tracking flows for the top five countries across four ISPs on April 4, 2018. Similar observations are derived for the other two dates in our dataset. The two ISPs operating in Germany, a country with highly developed IT and networking infrastructure, exhibit significantly higher confinement rates: 69% for DE-Broadband and 67.31% for DE-Mobile. This is in stark contrast to the 0.25% (not visible in Fig. 12(c)) and 6.85% for Poland (PL) and Hungary (HU), respectively.

As expected, a large portion of cross-border tracking flows are served by servers in neighboring EU countries, particularly those with advanced IT infrastructure. For example, German operators frequently use servers in the Netherlands and Ireland, while Polish and Hungarian operators often rely on servers in Germany and Austria. This analysis aligns with the data collected from real users using the browser extension (see Section 4).

## Related Work

A significant body of recent research has explored the privacy implications of online advertising and web tracking on desktop [28-30, 35, 41, 51, 58, 61], mobile [53, 60], and mixed platforms [36, 42, 52]. Table 9 summarizes and compares key features and approaches from this literature. We use a green checkmark for positive features, a red cross for negative ones, and a black dot for neutral features. The rating scheme is based on the challenges outlined in Section 2.3. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the only comprehensive study dedicated to cross-border tracking on the web. While some studies have touched on geographic aspects of tracking, none have done so with the depth and breadth of our work. Additionally, we have made methodological contributions that advance the state of the art along multiple directions (see the right column of Table 9 for an overview).

### Key Aspects of Literature Review

#### Third-Party Request Classification
One of the most critical and non-trivial problems is distinguishing third-party requests as either ad- or tracking-related. The most common solution is to use the "easylist" and "easyprivacy" [7] lists to detect these requests. However, a naive usage of these lists can lead to over- or under-estimation, depending on how they are applied. For instance, considering all domains in the list can result in overestimation, as domains like "google.com" can serve multiple types of requests. Alternatively, using the included blocking rules and classifying requests only when there is an exact match can help, but this approach may miss subsequent requests initiated by blocked content. These observations are also reported in [52, 58] and confirmed by our own work. We refer to the additional work we do to collect trackers not listed in the standard lists as "Custom Corrections" in Table 9.

#### Data Collection
The data collection process (Table 9 - Row 5) can influence the results. Using web crawling instead of real users can limit the number of observable third-party requests due to the lack of user interaction (e.g., scrolling or navigating). Ads are typically rendered only when the ad slot becomes visible to the user, which improves user experience, reduces data consumption, and ensures accurate billing for advertisers. For more discussion on the advantages of using real users in the mobile environment, see [42, 52]. Web crawling is more suitable for studies that do not require user interaction, such as collecting information about mobile apps from app stores [53] or web archives [41]. In our work, we use a browser extension to collect data from real users' browsers, overcoming the limitations of web crawling (see Section 3.1).

#### Infrastructure Geolocation
To improve user experience, most web platforms and e-stores use geolocation services to customize content based on the visitor's location. Consequently, geolocation services focus on accurately geolocating end users, with server infrastructure being a secondary priority. Manual examination of available geolocation services revealed that the location for most IPs related to infrastructure servers was determined based on the legal entity owner’s location (see Section 3.4). Using such services to infer server location is problematic. If the goal is to geolocate the legal entity behind a specific server IP, these services can be used safely (Table 9 - Row 6) [36, 53]. In our work, we address this issue by using a state-of-the-art solution based on active measurement to correctly geolocate infrastructure servers involved in web tracking and advertising activities.

#### Traffic Type
Another advantage is having a methodology that can work on encrypted traffic (Table 9 - Row 7). Most ad and tracking-related third-party requests in our study have already moved to encrypted traffic (83.14% based on the real users dataset). Ten out of fourteen studies in Table 9 can operate on encrypted traffic. Our novel methodology identifies tracking flows in the wild using ISPs NetFlows. Specifically, we use active measurement to identify IPs associated with ad and tracking activities within real users' browsers, regardless of the protocol used (HTTP or HTTPS), and analyze ISPs NetFlows at the IP level, avoiding the need for additional metadata or contextual information (see Sections 3.3 and 7.2).

## Conclusion

We have developed a comprehensive measurement and analysis methodology to quantify the percentage of tracking flows that terminate within national borders. Our analysis reveals that most tracking flows on European Union citizens terminate within EU member states, placing them under the full jurisdiction of GDPR and allowing European data protection authorities to conduct thorough investigations. This is a relatively optimistic result compared to other continents, such as South America, where most tracking flows terminate in North America.

Naturally, the level of confinement within national borders is lower than continent-wide confinement. We observe a clear correlation between the size of a country and the amount of tracking confined within its borders. There is also a correlation between the density of a country's IT infrastructure, particularly in terms of data centers, and the confinement of tracking flows. National confinement can be improved through simple DNS redirection to alternative tracking endpoints, which most tracking companies could implement at a low cost. However, for smaller countries with less advanced IT infrastructure, DNS redirection alone may not be sufficient, and tracking PoP mirroring within the country may be necessary.

An important finding of our study is that the confinement level of tracking flows related to protected data categories is similar to that of general traffic. This result can be viewed positively or negatively: positively, because such tracking can be readily investigated since most of it terminates within GDPR jurisdiction; negatively, because some of it should not be occurring in the first place.

In this work, we provide a methodology for bootstrapping and scaling an experiment to detect and geolocate different ad and tracking stakeholders under new data protection regulations, specifically GDPR. Our methodology can continuously monitor compliance with GDPR over time and can be extended to include monitoring of other regulations in different regional (e.g., USA) or content-specific (e.g., Children's Online Privacy Protection Act - COPPA [3, 38]) contexts.

In future work, we plan to build a system around our methodology, deploy it, and make it available to anyone who wants real-time, large-scale data on cross-border tracking. We also intend to extend our methodology to capture inter-tracker collaboration and data exchange beyond the terminating endpoint of tracking.
