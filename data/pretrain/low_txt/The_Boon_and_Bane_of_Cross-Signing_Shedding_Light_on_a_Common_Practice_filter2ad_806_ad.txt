### Repeated Cross-Signing and Name Constraints

The XS-Cert DoD Root CA2 has been repeatedly cross-signed. However, unlike previous XS-Certs, these cross-signs are limited to issuing for the U.S. Government only through name constraint extensions.

### 5.2.2 Cross-Signs of the Swiss Government

In 2016, the Swiss Government created the Swiss Government Public Trust Standard CA 02 intermediate, which was cross-signed by QuoVadis Enterprise Trust CA 2 G3 in 2017. Positively, QuoVadis used X509v3 Name Constraints to whitelist domains for which these cross-signs are allowed to issue certificates. However, QuoVadis did not set the critical flag for this extension, allowing implementations to ignore it. Consequently, the cross-signs could create undesired trust paths for software that does not implement X509v3 Name Constraints. This is particularly concerning for applications that derive trusted roots from root stores like Mozilla, Google, or Apple, as these do not establish a valid path for the original intermediate (unlike Microsoft’s root store). QuoVadis revoked the cross-signs via its CRL in mid-2019, but only CRLSet adopted this revocation. The Swiss Government did not misuse this opportunity: all 1,039 certificates observed in our measurements are part of the whitelisted domains.

In contrast, Baltimore CyberTrust Root did not set up name constraints when it cross-signed Swiss Government SSL CA 01 (an intermediate issued in 2014 by Swiss Government Root CA II, included in Microsoft’s root store since 2016). Until its expiry in 2017, this cross-sign allowed the Swiss CA to issue certificates with valid trust paths to all major root stores. In total, 756 certificates validated under these circumstances; 9 of them were not part of the whitelisted domains but still part of the Swiss top-level domain.

We describe three more cross-signs of state-controlled CAs when discussing DigiCert in the context of ownership changes (Section 5.6.2).

**Takeaway:** Due to extensive cross-signing in the FPKI, only a few trust anchors to the Web-PKI added many new trust paths. This highlights the need for mechanisms that provide CAs with better insight into the effect on trust paths before they cross-sign a certificate. Enforcing short validity periods for intermediates could limit the impact of unexpected trust paths.

### 5.3 The Good: Bootstrapping of New CAs

In contrast to the previous cases, which highlight security problems of cross-signing, we now focus on the benefits. For new CAs, inclusion into root stores is a lengthy process. Obtaining a cross-sign from a broadly trusted root or intermediate enables a CA to start its business while pursuing the inclusion process. In our dataset, we identify such bootstrapping help for Let’s Encrypt, the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), and GoDaddy. Additionally, CyberTrust bootstrapped trust in Actalis Authentication CA G2 when Actalis’ root had not yet been trusted (cf. Section 5.1.3). A full list of involved CAs, including COMODO, DigiCert, WoSign, GlobalSign, AffirmTrust, and government CAs, is provided in Appendix B.2.

#### 5.3.1 Bootstrapping Let’s Encrypt

Let’s Encrypt launched as a non-profit Certificate Authority in 2015, significantly increasing the amount of secured Internet communication by automating the certificate issuing process and providing certificates for free. To provide this service early on, it relied on a cross-sign by a widely trusted root for over five years. Specifically, Let’s Encrypt will default to its own ISRG Root starting September 29, 2020 [43]. Before this, IdenTrust helped to bootstrap trust for Let’s Encrypt. IdenTrust's DST Root CA X3 cross-signed four intermediates originally issued by the ISRG Root X1, a root of the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG) which manages Let’s Encrypt. As ISRG Root X1 was initially not included in root stores, IdenTrust was the sole trust anchor for Let’s Encrypt certificates, enabling a fast ramp-up of the service [42].

Let’s Encrypt uses four intermediate XS-Certs. Let’s Encrypt Authority X1 and X2 are no longer actively used [42] (but not revoked and still valid until the end of 2020). IdenTrust prevents the X1 and X2 cross-signs from issuing certificates for the top-level domain .mil. The more recent Let’s Encrypt Authority X3 is currently used to issue (leaf) certificates and remains valid until 2021-10 (original) and 2021-03 (cross-sign). Finally, Let’s Encrypt Authority X4 serves as a backup, expiring at the same time as X3.

### 5.4 Expanding Trust and Alternative Paths

Some root certificates are not included in all major root stores. We find that CAs broadly use cross-signs to close these gaps, enhancing their trust. For example, a cross-sign provides Entrust Root Certification Authority - G2 with trust paths for Mozilla. Similarly, USERTrust cross-signed AddTrust Qualified CA Root and AddTrust Class 1 CA Root to provide trust for Microsoft and the grid PKI. On the downside, these additional trust paths complicate certificate revocations. Bootstrapping (cf. Section 5.3) is a special case of this trust-expanding cross-signing. The count in Table 1 excludes bootstrapping cases. Furthermore, we distinguish cases that extend only the validity period. For example, GlobalSign Domain Validation CA - SHA256 - G2 originally used trust paths via GlobalSign Root CA - R3, while a cross-sign by GlobalSign Root CA extends the trust by several years.

#### 5.4.2 Alternative Paths

Often, multiple certificates of an XS-Cert provide valid paths to the same root store, providing fallback trust to deal with unexpected revocations or removals. For example, the intermediate XS-Certs for Servision Inc., XiPS, and KAGOYA JAPAN Inc. – originally issued by GoDaddy’s ValiCert Class 1 Policy Validation Authority – were cross-signed by SECOM’s Security Communication RootCA1 in 2012. The cross-signs provided readily usable fallback paths when the originally issuing ValiCert certificate was removed from Mozilla and Google root stores due to its 1024-bit RSA key [11, 12]. Note that most cross-signs establish alternative paths as issuing CA certificates are often trusted in many root stores. The count in Table 1 only lists XS-Certs whose sole outcome are alternative paths, i.e., it includes only XS-Certs that do not expand the trust.

**Takeaway:** Cross-signing enables large root store coverage if issuing CAs span only a subset of root stores. It can also provide alternative trust paths to proactively deal with CA revocations and removals, ensuring a non-disruptive user experience. However, multiple trust paths for a certificate can lead to incomplete revocations, challenging the security of PKIs (cf. Section 5.1). Using cross-signing for these purposes necessitates better mechanisms to mitigate these security problems. We discuss possible solutions such as better logging and limited lifetimes for XS-Certs in Section 6.

### 5.5 Cross-Signing Eases the Transition to New Cryptographic Algorithms

Security guidelines by entities like the CAB Forum motivate CAs to support advancements in cryptography early on, e.g., new signature algorithms. To maintain backward compatibility for legacy implementations, CAs use cross-signs to establish alternative trust paths that support new algorithms. Legacy clients that do not support the new algorithms can still use the old trust paths. We find this happening commonly with intermediate XS-Certs. For root certificates, this approach is not required, as their self-signed signatures are typically not checked by clients [10]. In these cases, the CA can just issue a new intermediate that uses the new algorithms.

For example, the Virginia Tech Global Qualified Server CA intermediate was issued with a SHA1 signature by Trusted Root CA G2 (GlobalSign) in 2012. In December 2014, approaching the deadline for deprecating issuance based on SHA1 [37], GlobalSign cross-signed the intermediate from the Trusted Root CA SHA256 G2. The SHA1 intermediate was revoked in January 2017.

Even after the switch to the ISRG roots, the cross-signs will be beneficial: legacy clients that do not include the ISRG roots in their root store can fall back to the IdenTrust trust path [42].

### 5.3.2 Entrust Helped CNNIC

Similar to Let’s Encrypt, the Chinese CNNIC obtained bootstrapping help from an established CA. Entrust.net Secure Server Certification Authority issued a CNNIC SSL intermediate in 2007. Shortly after the inclusion of CNNIC ROOT into root stores (e.g., 2009 for Mozilla [9]), the CNNIC ROOT cross-signed this intermediate, creating an alternate trust path.

### 5.3.3 GoDaddy – Internal Bootstrapping via Subsidiary

GoDaddy used cross-signing to bootstrap trust into its CA certificates [7] when it entered the certificate business in 2004. Unlike the previous cases, it used an internal cross-sign. Specifically, GoDaddy started with the root certificates GoDaddy Class 2 CA and Starfield Class 2 CA and cross-signed them with ValiCert’s root ValiCert Class 2 Policy Validation CA (created in 1999). Interestingly, GoDaddy acquired ValiCert just the year before, likely preparing for its new business. Until its removal from root stores around 2014, the ValiCert root thus bootstrapped trust to Mozilla, Android, and Apple for the new certificates.

GoDaddy later bootstrapped a root for Amazon: when Amazon created its Amazon Root CA 1 in 2015, an immediate cross-sign by Starfield Services Root CA - G2 established trust right away, whereas it took years for Amazon’s root to arrive in root stores. For example, Mozilla and Google included it in 2017, and Apple even later in 2018.

**Takeaway:** Cross-signing enables new CAs to start their business during the process of including their roots into root stores. Without such a cross-sign, the long periods for inclusion and sufficient propagation of root stores, which can take several years, could be prohibitive for new companies in this business.

### 5.6 Effect of Ownership Changes on XS-Certs

In this section, we analyze the effect of CA acquisitions on existing cross-signs. Cross-signs, especially across organizations, add contractual obligations and necessitate trust-granting CAs to check the actions of CAs they cross-signed. Thus, we are interested in whether new owners revoke cross-signs created by acquired CAs and whether cross-signs are revoked once the owner of a cross-signed CA changes.

#### 5.6.1 Cross-Signs Outlive Ownership Changes

The Network Solutions Certificate Authority root has been repeatedly cross-signed by members of Comodo’s trust network, spanning several ownership changes. The original root was created in 2006, when Network Solutions had been owned by Pivotal Equity for three years. In the same year, Comodo’s UTN-USERFirst-Hardware cross-signed the root twice. After Network Solutions was sold to General Atlantic, Comodo’s AddTrust External CA Root cross-signed the certificate in 2010. Furthermore, we find a cross-sign by AddTrust: this intermediate has been valid since 2000—when Network Solutions was owned by VeriSign—but it likely was backdated (cf. Section 5.7.1). All these cross-signs outlived the acquisition of Network Solutions by web.com in 2011 and remain valid until 2020, thus spanning at least two ownership changes.

We also find cases where the CAs that issue cross-sign certificates changed owners. When DigiCert created the DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA in 2006, it was cross-signed by Entrust.net Secure Server Certificate Authority and Entrust.net Certificate Authority. Three years later, Thoma Bravo acquired Entrust and sold it to Datacard in 2013, which rebranded it to Entrust Datacard. Despite these ownership changes, the cross-signs of DigiCert’s root remained valid (until 2014 and 2015), making the new owners responsible for trust paths of certificates issued by DigiCert. This raises the question of whether the new owners were aware of the cross-signs and decided to keep them or if they simply were not aware of their existence.

#### 5.6.2 DigiCert – Internal Islands and External Legacy Cross-Signing

In the DigiCert group, most XS-Certs were created before DigiCert acquired the corresponding CAs. Thus, we predominantly find internal cross-signs within each subsidiary and only a few cross-signs across DigiCert subsidiaries. Most cross-signs originate from times of VeriSign, Verizon, and QuoVadis. DigiCert only occasionally used the acquired certificates to cross-sign its own DigiCert roots.

When acquiring Verizon in 2015, DigiCert also became responsible for external XS-Certs. First, Verizon cross-signed root certificates of WellsFargo in 2013 and 2015. All corresponding intermediates were revoked by the CA’s CRL and Mozilla’s OneCRL in 2017, when the roots were removed from all root stores (after request by WellsFargo [15]), except for Apple. Similarly, Verizon cross-signed Certipost E-Trust Primary Normalized CA, providing this formerly only Microsoft-trusted root with broad trust coverage.

Verizon also cross-signed state-controlled CAs, which is potentially problematic (cf. Section 5.2). In 2010 and 2013, it cross-signed the Swiss Government root, increasing its trust beyond Apple and Microsoft. Similarly, it cross-signed the Belgium Root CA2 and Portugal’s SCEE ECRaizEstado—some of which were later revoked in 2018 due to a series of misissuances [21]. The acquisition of Verizon made DigiCert responsible for these cross-signs of state-controlled CAs. Thus, cross-signs not only provided state-controlled CAs with large trust coverage but also faced ownership changes, increasing the risk of unnoticed problems.

We describe further XS-Certs with ownership changes and provide details on DigiCert’s cross-signs in Appendix B.5.

**Takeaway:** Considering the frequent cross-signs across CAs, potential new owners must review existing issued and received cross-signs and corresponding obligations before acquiring a CA. Similarly, cross-signing CAs must be informed when a cross-signed CA changes its owner. Both require an easily accessible and verifiable store of XS-Certs, as we suggest in Section 6.

### 5.7 The Ugly: Potentially Problematic Practices and Missing Transparency

In this section, we highlight practices of CAs that, while not explicitly forbidden, are frowned upon by root store maintainers [67] or make it hard to assess the legitimacy of existing trust.

#### 5.7.1 Backdating of Cross-Signs

Comodo’s AddTrust External CA Root backdates several cross-signs, setting the "not before" field to a date several years before the actual issuance. We used crt.sh to verify that the early "not before" dates are not caused by re-issued root certificates. Backdating is explicitly forbidden if it bypasses a validation requirement.
