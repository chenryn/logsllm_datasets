### Experimental Setup and Results

#### Trial Parameters
1. Each trial lasts 30 minutes and is conducted under constant WiFi interference.
2. The expected duration of the laser emission, \( E(T_{\text{on}}) \), is 30 seconds for each trial.
3. The event `evtToStop` occurs when the lease expiration forces the laser-scalpel to stop emitting (see Fig. 12). This ensures that the system adheres to the PTE safety rules.

#### System Configuration
- Interfaces are implemented using ZigBee TMote-Sky motes [23].
- An IEEE 802.11g WiFi interference source, located 2 meters away from the supervisor, broadcasts interfering WiFi packets at a data rate of 3 Mbps in a radio band overlapping with that of the ZigBee TMote-Sky motes. This interference is independent of the laser tracheotomy wireless CPS communications, leading to potential packet loss between the supervisor, ventilator, and laser-scalpel emulation computers.

#### Trials and Results
We conducted two emulation trials, each lasting 30 minutes. The PTE safety rules during these trials were:
1. Neither the ventilator pause nor the laser emission can last more than 1 minute (assuming holding breath for 60 seconds is always safe).
2. The ventilator pause duration must properly-temporally-embed the laser emission duration, with entering/exiting safeguard intervals of \( T_{\text{min, risky:1→2}} = 3 \) seconds and \( T_{\text{min, safe:2→1}} = 1.5 \) seconds.
3. Violation of either of the PTE safety rules results in a failure.

In both trials, the emulated surgeon requested to emit or cancel the laser based on timers \( T_{\text{on}} \) and \( T_{\text{off}} \), which follow an exponential distribution. The expectation of \( T_{\text{on}} \) is 30 seconds, while the expectations of \( T_{\text{off}} \) are 18 seconds and 6 seconds, respectively, in the two trials.

#### Impact of Leasing
Due to our proposed lease-based design pattern and the configuration of parameters satisfying Theorem 2, the PTE safety rules were never violated despite arbitrary packet losses. Table I shows that both rows corresponding to "with Lease" have 0 failures.

For comparison, we ran two additional trials without the leasing mechanism. Specifically, the ventilator and laser-scalpel did not set up lease timers. When the surgeon's cancel laser emission event or the supervisor's abort event was lost, no one could terminate the ventilator's pause or the laser's emission. As shown in Table I, the two rows corresponding to "without Lease" resulted in many failures.

#### Explanation of Results
The leasing mechanism ensures that the ventilator's stay in the pause state (risky location) expires on lease timeout, automatically returning to "Fall-Back" to continue ventilating the patient, even if communication is cut off. Similarly, the laser-scalpel's stay in the emission state (risky location) also expires on lease timeout. Conditions c1–c7 of Theorem 2 further guarantee that the automatic returns to "Fall-Back" conform to proper-temporal-embedding even under arbitrary packet/event losses.

#### Scenario Analysis
1. **Scenario 1: Late Cancellation**
   - If the surgeon forgets to cancel the laser emission until too late (e.g., \( T_{\text{off}} \) is set to 1 hour), only the supervisor's abort request can stop the laser and resume the ventilator. However, this requires a sequence of correct send/receive events through wireless communication. Losing any of these events can cause PTE safety rule violations.
   - With leasing, the laser emission terminates within the lease \( T_{\text{max, run,2}} = 20 \) seconds, and the ventilator resumes within the lease \( T_{\text{max, run,1}} = 35 \) seconds, thus protecting the PTE safety rules.

2. **Scenario 2: Lost Cancellation Request**
   - If the surgeon remembers to cancel the laser emission but the cancellation request is not received by the supervisor, the ventilator may keep pausing for too long without leasing. With leasing, the ventilator will pause for at most \( T_{\text{max, run,1}} = 35 \) seconds, preventing suffocation.

3. **Scenario 3: Parameter Configuration**
   - If \( T_{\text{max, enter,1}} = 0 \) seconds (or any value such that \( T_{\text{max, enter,2}} = T_{\text{max, enter,1}} \)), and \( T_{\text{min, risky:1→2}} = 3 \) seconds, Condition c5 of Theorem 1 is violated. Under such a design, the laser-scalpel can emit immediately after the ventilator is paused, violating the PTE requirement of a 3-second wait.

Following the proposed lease-based design approach and meeting the parameter configuration constraints listed in Theorems 1 and 2 ensures PTE safety rules.

### Related Work
Lease protocols were originally proposed by Gray et al. [7] for providing efficient consistent access to cached data in distributed computer systems. Various lease-based distributed computer systems have been implemented to achieve system consistency [8]–[10]. Boix et al. [11] applied leases to mobile ad hoc networks, and Adya et al. [12] applied leases to cloud computing. However, these systems differ fundamentally from CPS due to the following reasons:
1. Checkpoint and rollback, used in lease protocols for distributed systems, are often impossible in CPS (e.g., reviving a killed patient).
2. PTE temporal ordering, particularly the minimum safeguard interval requirements, are usually not present in distributed systems, which focus on causal precedences.
3. In CPS, uncontrollable physical world parameters can interfere with computer software dynamics.

Formal methods and model checking techniques have been widely used in various applications. Majzik et al. [25] apply formal methods to evaluate the Driver Machine Interface (DMI). Ramasamy et al. [26] use the SPIN model checker to validate the correctness of a formal model of the intrusion-tolerant Group Membership Protocol (GMP). Donatelli et al. [27] solve the problem of Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL) model checking in the context of Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets. Buchholz et al. [28] present a new framework for model checking techniques applicable to weighted automata. Haverkort [29] summarizes the formal modeling of timed systems in practice.

In the design pattern formalization, formal methods have also been applied [30]–[33]. For hybrid modeling, it is mostly used for verification [3], [13]–[16]. Tichakorn [34] proposed a subclass of hybrid automata for a class of hybrid control systems, applying it to verify the safety of an autonomous vehicle. However, the intent there is verification rather than a design methodology as in our work.

### Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a lease-based design pattern to guarantee PTE safety rules in wireless CPS, addressing challenges arising from poor reliability of wireless communication. We derived closed-form constraints and proved that as long as system parameters are configured to satisfy these constraints, PTE safety rules are guaranteed under arbitrary wireless communication faults. We developed hybrid modeling approaches to describe the design patterns and a formal methodology to elaborate the design pattern into specific designs that provide PTE safety guarantees. Our case study on laser tracheotomy wireless CPS validates the proposed design methodology.
