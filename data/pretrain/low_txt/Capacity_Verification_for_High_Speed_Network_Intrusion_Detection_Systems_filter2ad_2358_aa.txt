## Preface
On behalf of the program committee, it is our pleasure to present the proceedings of the Fifth Symposium on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID). Since its inception in 1998, RAID has become the premier annual event for intrusion detection, attracting researchers, practitioners, and vendors from around the world.

For RAID 2002, the program committee received 81 submissions (64 full papers and 17 extended abstracts) from 20 countries, representing a 50% increase over the previous year. Each submission was rigorously reviewed by at least three program committee members or additional experts, based on criteria of scientific novelty, relevance to the field, and technical quality. The final selection was made during a meeting in Oakland, USA, on May 15–16, 2002. Sixteen full papers and three extended abstracts were selected for presentation and publication.

The program covered both fundamental research and practical issues, with sessions on anomaly detection, stepping-stone detection, correlation of intrusion-detection alarms, assessment of intrusion-detection systems, intrusion tolerance, legal aspects, adaptive intrusion-detection systems, and intrusion-detection analysis. Additionally, RAID 2002 hosted a panel on "Cybercrime" and a keynote speech by Marcus J. Ranum, founder of Network Flight Recorder, Inc., titled "Challenges for the Future of Intrusion Detection."

We extend our sincere thanks to all who submitted papers, the Program Committee members, and the additional reviewers for their efforts. Special thanks go to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich for hosting this year's symposium.

### Abstract
To evade detection and capture, hackers often chain multiple computers together, attacking the victim computer from a distance. This report proposes a new strategy for detecting suspicious remote sessions used as part of a long connection chain. Interactive terminal sessions behave differently on long chains compared to direct connections. The time gap between a client request and the server's delayed acknowledgment estimates the round-trip time to the nearest server. Similarly, the time gap between a client request and the server reply echo provides information on the number of hops downstream to the final victim. By monitoring these two time gaps, echo-delay comparison can identify a suspicious session in isolation. Experiments confirm that this method is effective in a range of situations, particularly in detecting outgoing connections with more than two hops downstream.

### Keywords
Stepping stone, connection chain, intrusion detection, computer security, network security, network protocol, terminal session, delayed acknowledgment, reply echo, echo delay.

### 1. Introduction
Network security and intrusion detection have become critical areas of research due to the increasing frequency and cost of network attacks. As the Internet becomes more ubiquitous, so do the threats to network security. Effective intrusion detection is essential for the smooth operation of computer networks.

### 1.1 Motivation
A skilled hacker often launches attacks from a distance to conceal their identity. Before launching a significant attack, they may break into multiple computers across different administrative domains to gather accounts. With access to these accounts, the hacker can create a chain of computers through remote sessions, using intermediate machines as stepping stones to reach the final victim.
