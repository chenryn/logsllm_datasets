**Title: BotConf 2019 - An Analysis of the Shaoye Android Botnet**

The activities of the Shaoye botnet began in June 2017, with the peak of its attacks observed in January 2018. In March 2018, the Taiwan National Computer Emergency Response Team (TWNCERT) received intelligence from the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) in Japan regarding a DNS hijacking incident. The intelligence indicated that hackers had altered the settings of home routers in Japan, redirecting DNS requests to rogue IP addresses located in Taiwan. As a result, users who accessed the internet through these compromised routers were redirected to malicious websites, where they were prompted to download harmful APK files.

This analysis provides an in-depth examination of the Shaoye botnet's operations, including its methods of propagation, the impact of the DNS hijacking, and the measures taken to mitigate the threat.
