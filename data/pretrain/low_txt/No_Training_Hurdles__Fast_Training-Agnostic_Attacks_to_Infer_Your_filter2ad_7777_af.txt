### Methodology and Comparative Analysis

The proposed method for keystroke inference requires collecting 10 minutes of keystrokes, which amounts to approximately 340 words, achieving a word recovery rate of 87.6%. This minimized training method may not be effective for wireless-based attacks due to the time-varying nature of the wireless channel. A 10-minute training period might be too long to generate a useful mapping between observed Channel State Information (CSI) samples and letters. Unlike other methods such as [42], frequency analysis, and other statistical approaches, the proposed method leverages the self-contained structures of words, observable immediately as they are typed, rather than relying on probabilistic statistics among words, which require a large corpus to establish. Consequently, the proposed attack only needs 50 words within 1-2 minutes to achieve a word recovery rate of 94.3%.

### Triangulation Localization Technique

An adversary can use triangulation localization to pinpoint the sound source and infer which keys are being typed [19, 41]. However, this approach necessitates sophisticated equipment capable of accurately measuring sound propagation distances and requires line-of-sight between the keyboard and the equipment. These requirements significantly hinder the practicality and applicability of the attack.

Berger et al. [9] infer keystrokes by observing that similar sounds are likely to come from keys positioned close to each other on the keyboard. Their technique aims to reconstruct a single long word (7-13 characters) that must appear in a dictionary. In contrast, the proposed attack aims to reconstruct the entire typed content, regardless of whether all its constituent words are in the dictionary.

### Timing-Based Attacks

Keystroke timing patterns can also be used to infer keystrokes [28, 32, 40]. For example, [32] infers keystroke sequences using inter-keystroke timing information collected from SSH packet arrival times. [28] proposes inferring keystrokes by utilizing keystroke timing information gathered via cache-based load measurements on an idle machine. [40] infers keystroke sequences by leveraging shared information on a multi-user system. However, these timing-based attacks generally require a training process to statistically generate the attack models, except for the specific methods of obtaining the keystroke timing information.

### Wireless Signal-Based Attacks

Recent research efforts have focused on performing keystroke eavesdropping attacks using wireless signals, driven by the ubiquity of wireless infrastructures and the invisibility of radio signals, which eliminate the need for line-of-sight. Specifically, [11] infers keystrokes by examining the amplitude and phase changes of wireless signals, while [6, 18] utilize the channel conditions extracted from the observed wireless signal to distinguish keystrokes. Despite these advancements, all these works still require a training process to construct the relationship between the observed signal features and the typing activity.

### Camera-Based Attacks

A traditional and intuitive method to infer keystrokes is to use cameras to record the typing process and then identify keystrokes by analyzing the recorded video. Researchers have found that recording hand movements [8, 31, 39], tablet backside motion [33], or the shadow around fingertips [38] can aid in keystroke inference. However, if the movement of interest is not visible to the camera, keystroke activities cannot be detected.

### Cryptanalysis-Based Attacks

Cryptanalysis involves discovering secrets and can be performed through known-plaintext or ciphertext-only attacks. If we consider the CSI sample as the ciphertext and the original typed content as the plaintext, the training-based keystroke inference attacks [6, 18] are known-plaintext attacks because the attacker must know some plaintext (typed content) and the corresponding ciphertext (CSI) for training. The proposed method, however, does not require training data and thus is a ciphertext-only attack. Existing ciphertext-only attacks that attempt to decode natural language ciphertexts are largely based on statistical information about the ciphertext [22, 25]. For example, [25] uses character frequency analysis for authorship identification and validation, while [22] recovers plaintext using a statistical language model and a dynamic programming algorithm.

### Conclusion

We have identified a new type of keystroke eavesdropping attack that bypasses several limitations of previous attacks:
1. **Training Phase Requirement**: The proposed attack does not require a training phase, which is impractical in many scenarios.
2. **Malware Installation**: It does not need to deceive the user or bypass anti-virus and firewall software to install malware on the target device.
3. **Line-of-Sight Requirement**: It does not require line-of-sight between the attacker’s device and the keyboard.

This attack is constructed based on CSI extracted from wireless signals, with a joint demodulation algorithm that establishes the mapping between each letter and the corresponding CSI sample without training. We implemented this attack on the USRP X300 platform running GNURadio and conducted experiments to validate it. The results show a word recovery ratio of 0.95 for an input of 150 words, compared to less than 0.02 for traditional frequency analysis methods.
