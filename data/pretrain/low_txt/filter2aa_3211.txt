The future is here, in the present. To truly see it, one must take a leap of faith. Richard Thieme guides you to the edge of a precipice and gives you that necessary push.

During the free fall, new ways of thinking emerge. Identities diverge, forms transform, and questions linger long after you finish this remarkable book. *Mind Games* provides the wings for this journey. Take the risk; you will never be merely human again.

Richard Thieme is a true digital Renaissance man. He leveraged the early Internet to reach thousands of global readers, who dubbed him a member of the "cyber avant-garde" (CNN), "a father figure for online culture" (London Sunday Telegraph), "a keen observer" (Le Monde), and "one of the most creative minds of the digital generation" (CTHEORY). He has captivated audiences with topics ranging from creativity and security to professional intelligence in times of radical change, biohacking, the transformation of spirituality and religion, and an introduction to UFOlogy.

Humans are indeed a unique species.
