## This Is the Desert
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water. The desert can be unforgiving.
- **All Good:** Sit down, relax, and grab a glass of water. If you feel unwell, call a doctor.

## The Countdown: Simple Rules for Surviving DEF CON
1. **Sleep:** Get at least three hours of sleep each night.

  - Don’t block the hallway or stand at the base of the escalator.

  - For photos and other personal interactions, always ask nicely.

## Phones and Wireless

- **Expect to Be in Pictures:** You might end up in a photo or two. If you don’t want to be, ask politely.
