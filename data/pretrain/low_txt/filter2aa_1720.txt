**Author:** Sam Bowne

**Institution:** City College San Francisco

## Introduction
City College of San Francisco (CCSF) has introduced a new course on hacking, which is an integral part of our program. This document outlines the rationale, structure, and outcomes of this innovative class.

## Why Teach Hacking?
- **Lectures Alone Are Insufficient:** Hands-on experience is crucial for students to understand and apply concepts.
- **Practical Experience:** Students need to practice both offensive and defensive techniques.
- **Engagement:** Hacking is a dynamic and exciting field that captures students' interest.
- **Professional Relevance:** Even experienced network administrators often lack knowledge in this area.

### Addressing Concerns
- **Criminal Intentions:** Those with malicious intent typically do not seek formal education in hacking.
- **Ethical Considerations:** It is better to teach ethical hacking in a controlled environment than to leave students to learn it independently.
- **Open Dialogue:** Discussing these issues openly promotes responsible behavior.

## Course Structure
### Prerequisites
- Network+ and Security+ certifications
- No programming background required; the course focuses on using existing tools rather than creating exploits.

### Course Content
- **Vulnerability Demonstration, Attack, and Defense:** Each project covers these three aspects.
- **Tools Used:**
  - Metasploit
  - Nmap
  - Wireshark
  - Nessus
  - Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA)
  - Winfingerprint
  - Ettercap
  - Ophcrack
  - Cain and Abel
  - John the Ripper

### Lab Setup
- **Host Systems:**
  - Windows XP: 1 GB RAM, 2.2 GHz Pentium 4, 20 GB system drive, 80 GB drive for VMs
- **Virtual Machines:**
  - Windows XP
  - Windows 2000 Pro
  - Ubuntu Linux
- **Internet Connection:**
  - Single ZyXel router
  - Upstream bandwidth limited to 128 kbps for security

### Ethical Guidelines
- **Code of Ethics:** Each student signs an agreement.
- **Warnings:** Posted in the lab and displayed on screens during boot-up.

### Student Assistants
- **Volunteers:** Monitor the lab and have access keys.
- **Community Building:** The lab became a hub for ethical hackers.
- **Security and Morale:** No equipment was damaged or stolen, and morale remained high.

## Project Examples
### Attacks
- **Metasploit:**
  - Taking over a Windows 2000 box from Windows XP
  - Taking over a locked Windows 2000 box from Linux
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack:** Using Nmap on a web server
- **Rootkit Installation and Removal:** On Ubuntu Linux
- **Basic Website Hacking:** Using HackThisSite.org

### Finding Vulnerabilities
- **Port Scanning:** With Nmap
- **Analyzing Port Scans:** With Wireshark
- **Firewall Testing:**
- **NetBIOS Null Sessions:**
- **Nessus Vulnerability Scanner:**
- **MBSA:**
- **Winfingerprint:**

### Stealing Passwords
- **Ettercap:**
- **Keyloggers:**
  - Software and hardware
- **Ophcrack:**
- **Cain and Abel:**
- **John the Ripper:**

### Bypassing Passwords
- **Ubuntu Linux:**
  - Live CD and mount
  - Recovery mode
- **Windows:**
  - Ultimate Boot CD

## Course Outcomes
- **Enrollment:** 80 students
- **Pass Rate:** 40 students (50% success rate, typical for such courses)
- **Incidents:** No security incidents reported
- **Student Feedback:** High enthusiasm and positive reviews
- **Future Interest:** Many students expressed interest in advanced hacking classes

## Conclusion
Teaching hacking at CCSF has been highly rewarding with no significant problems. However, it is important to note that:
- **CCSF's Unique Environment:** Our students are typically working professionals, which may differ from four-year colleges where students live in dormitories and could potentially engage in more mischief.

## Credits
- **Support:** Institute for Convergence of Optical and Network Systems (ICONS), funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF)
- **Hosting and Encouragement:** Computer Networking and Information Technology Department, especially Carmen Lamha and Pierre Thiry
