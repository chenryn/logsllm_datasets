# RoleVAT: A Visual Assessment Tool for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Introduction
RoleVAT is a tool designed to visually assess the natural groupings of users and permissions in an organization, thereby identifying the practical need for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This paper presents experimental results and analysis of RoleVAT on real and synthetic datasets.

## Data and Setup
- **Educational Domain:**
  - Users: 3729
  - Permissions: 10378
  - RBAC Implemented: No
  - Roles: 25

- **Medium-Sized Enterprise Domain:**
  - Users: 500
  - Permissions: 500
  - RBAC Implemented: No
  - Roles: 237

- **Small Enterprise Domain:**
  - Users: 500
  - Permissions: 500
  - RBAC Implemented: Yes
  - Roles: 10

- **Large Enterprise Domain:**
  - Users: 3729
  - Permissions: 10378
  - RBAC Implemented: Yes
  - Roles: 237

- **Synthetic Data:**
  - Users: 500
  - Permissions: 500
  - Roles: 10
  - Generated using Zhang et al.’s data generator [25].

## Processing Time
- **Permission RoleVAT:**
  - Small dataset: 0.24 seconds
  - Medium dataset: 2.55 seconds
  - Large dataset: 99.37 seconds

- **User RoleVAT:**
  - Small dataset: 0.03 seconds
  - Medium dataset: 40.06 seconds
  - Large dataset: 0.66 seconds

## Experimental Results
### Educational Domain
- **Figure 2:**
  - (a) Permission tendency
  - (b) User tendency
  - **Observation:** Limited cluster tendencies along the diagonal, indicating no clear roles.

### Medium-Sized Enterprise Domain
- **Figure 3:**
  - (a) Permission tendency
  - (b) User tendency
  - **Observation:** Limited cluster tendencies along the diagonal, indicating no clear roles.

### Small Enterprise Domain
- **Figure 4:**
  - (a) Permission tendency
  - (b) User tendency
  - **Observation:** Clear role and user group tendencies, suggesting the presence of roles.

### Large Enterprise Domain
- **Figure 5:**
  - (a) Permission tendency
  - (b) User tendency
  - **Observation:** Prominent dark clusters along the diagonal, indicating well-defined roles and user groups.

### Synthetic Dataset
- **Figure 6:**
  - (a) Permission tendency
  - (b) User tendency with 3 partitions
  - **Observation:** 10 prominent dark squares along the diagonal, each representing one of the 10 roles from the original data.

## Discussion and Analysis
- **Cluster Tendency Analysis:** RoleVAT confirms the existence of roles through visual assessment of user and permission tendencies.
- **Role Identification:** Dark squares represent strong similarity between permissions or users in the cluster, while large squares indicate significant roles or user groups.
- **Data Partitioning:** RoleVAT can identify when data can be partitioned into smaller subsets, improving the performance of role mining techniques.
- **Efficiency:** Computation on even the largest dataset completes in under 100 seconds, with the most computationally expensive part being the calculation of the dissimilarity matrix.

## Conclusion and Future Work
- **Conclusion:** RoleVAT is an effective tool for identifying the practical need for RBAC within an enterprise. It can quickly reveal interesting attributes of RBAC environments and identify data partitions.
- **Future Work:**
  - Automate role quantity extraction for larger datasets.
  - Investigate the use of rectangular dissimilarity matrices for both user and permission tendencies.
  - Explore alternative dissimilarity measures and reordering methods.
