### 8. Conclusion

First-order moments of end-to-end loss rates are generally insufficient to uniquely identify average link loss rates. More information is required. In this paper, we have shown that second-order spatial statistics are sufficient to uniquely identify the variances of loss rates, which in turn uniquely determine the average loss rates of the most congested links. This is under the assumption that the variance is a non-decreasing function of the mean, and thus the loss rate of non-congested links is virtually zero. Our simulations and experiments demonstrate that this method is both accurate and scalable.

We expect that the sufficient information provided by second-order statistics of end-to-end paths, without multicast support, can be leveraged for other network inference problems. One immediate extension is to compute link delays. Congested links typically exhibit high delay variations. To achieve this, we would need to take multiple snapshots of the network to learn about the delay variances. Based on the inferred variances, we could then reduce the first-order moment equations by removing links with small congestion delays and solve for the delays of the remaining congested links.

Another extension is the detection of anomalies in the network from a few vantage points. The inference method is fast, making it potentially useful for such problems.

An important question to address is the choice of the optimal value for the snapshot duration \( S \). As stated earlier, answering this requires an understanding of the statistical properties of link performances on small time-scales. We intend to work on this problem in our future research.
