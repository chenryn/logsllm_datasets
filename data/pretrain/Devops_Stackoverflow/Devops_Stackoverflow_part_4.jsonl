If you use the former approach, google will be confused and will index only one language, or, worse, make an ugly mix of the languages. Google does not keep sessions when indexing your page, so if you have two versions of the same page in two different languages, they need to have different URLs. And passing a language as a GET parameter each time is ugly, error prone, and not user friendly.So you should either have languages as folders (eg. site.com/en/), which is the best options, or use subdomains.
