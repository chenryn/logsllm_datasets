Malware as a Service

The cloud has spawned many types of services – Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service
(PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and others. Now add a new one. According to the 2011 Data
BreachInvestigationsReport(DBIR),1recentlypublishedbyVerizon,it’sMalwareasaService(MaaS).
Verizon’s 2011 DBIR sends a clear message – small companies, watch out. The Internet has become a
source of free or low-cost malware that is easilycustomizable to meet every hacker’s needs. Malware as
a Service significantly reduces the skill set needed by a cybercriminal to launch automated attacks. The
result is a shift in the demographics of information-asset attacks from large corporations to smaller
companies.
The DBIR suggests two reasons for this change in attack demographics – the success of law
enforcement and the emergence of Malware as a Service. Law-enforcement successes are motivating
cybercriminals to look for softer, less riskytargets. Malware as a Service is making the effort of attacking
smallercompaniesmoreattractive.

What is the DBIR?
The 2011 DBIR is the seventh in a series of reports on data breaches investigated by Verizon. The
number of Year 2010 breach incidents analyzed in this year’s DBIR has been significantly expanded by
breach data provided by the United States Secret Service. The USSS was formed in 1865 to combat
counterfeiting of the newly issued U.S. paper currency. It is now charged with safeguarding payment and
financialsystemsintheUnitedStates.
TheDBIRanalyzesbreachesintermsofthenumberofbreachincidentsandthenumberofcompromised
records (a “record” is a card number, a file, or some other data unit). In 2010, the combined forensic

After four years of increases, compromised records hit an all-time high of 361 million in 2008. In 2009,
this number had dropped to 144 million compromised records. Clearly, something was changing. Was
corporatesecuritygettingthatmuchbetter?
Then in 2010, less than 4 million records were compromised. 361 million to 144 million to 4 million!
Something significant was happening. Was it simply that fewer incidents were being investigated? No –
therewere70%moreincidentsinvestigatedin2010thanintheprevious years.
The clue to this drastic reduction was that the number of compromised records per incident from 2004
through2009averaged2,000,000,butthis statistic dropped drasticallyin2010toless than7,000records
per incident. Even more telling is that in years prior to 2010, 13% of all breaches exceeded 1,000,000
records(mega-breaches).In2010,93%ofallbreachescompromisedlessthan10,000records;andthere
werenomega-breaches.
Is this a trend or an anomaly? Unfortunately, as it turns out, this is an anomaly. Mega-breaches have
returned in force in 2011, with Sony, Epsilon, RSA, Citigroup, and Steam being prime examples. Sony
itselfcontributedmorethan100millionrecordstothehackers.Butthisanomalyhadafortunateoutcome.
It exposed a much more subtle but equally serious threat – the commoditizing of malware to make it
available to even inexperienced hackers. As the Verizon report indicates, companies not only must
continue to protect themselves against mega-breaches but now must be able to detect and maintain a
growingnumberofmini-breaches.
Let us first review the Verizon DBIR methodology in order to trace the DBIR findings to the new security
threat–MalwareasaService.
Verizon’s Methodology
Verizon describes a breach incident as a series of events. If the event chain is broken, the breach might
notoccur.
Eventsarecharacterizedbyfourattributes–theFourAs:
 Agent:Anentitythatcausedorcontributedtotheincident.
 Action:AnactiontakenbyanAgent.
 Asset:Whichofthevictim’sassetswereaffected.
 Attribute:Howtheassetwasaffected.

Agents
VerizoncategorizesAgentsintoexternalandinternal,andinternalAgentsintoactiveandpassive:
 AnExternalAgentisalonehackerororganizedcrimegroupoutsideoftheorganization.
 An Internal Active Agent is a manager, employee, or contractor who maliciously participates in a
breach.
 An Internal Passive Agent is a person internal to the company who inadvertently participates in
theincidentduetosomeerror.
92% of all incidents investigated in 2010 and 99% of all compromised data were attributed to External
Agents.Overhalfofthemwereorganizedcrimegroups.

However, Internal Agents accounted for the majority of stolen company confidential information. In fact,

Actions
Actionsinclude:
 Malware–anysoftwareusedforthepurposeofcompromisinginformationassets.
 Hacking–anattempttoaccessorharminformationassets.
 Physical–usingphysicaldevicestocompromisedata.
 Misuse–usingtrustedresourcesorprivilegesforunintendedpurposes.
 Social–intrusionbydeceptionorbribery.
 Errors–anythingdoneincorrectlyorinadvertently.
Malware includes the installation of backdoors through which an attacker can gain access to a system;
key loggers, frame grabbers, and RAM scrappers; and interference with security controls. Malware may
beinjectedviaemailsorcompromisedwebsites.
Hacking is any effort to access or harm information assets by thwarting security mechanisms. Hackers
maygainentrytoasystemviaabackdoororviatheuseofstolen,guessable,ordefaultlogincredentials.
Attaching skimmers to ATMs and pay-at-the-pump card readers and using hard drives to copy
confidentialdataareexamplesofphysicalactions.
Skimming credit-card information and embezzlement are misuses of trusted assets. For instance, wait
staffareentrustedwithpossessionofcreditcardswhilepreparingbills.
Social actions may be collusion with bank tellers to steal account information or with wait staff to skim
credit-card information. Deception is a common social action – for instance, sending a phishing email or
pretextingtobearepairmaninordertoreplacePOSdeviceswithcompromiseddevices.
Errors include omissions, misconfigurations, programming errors, etc. A frequent example of an error is
thefailuretochangedefaultcredentials.
Hacking and malware are byfar the mostcommon actions, each having been used in half of all incidents
in2010.

Servers were compromised in over half of all incidents by being infected with malware. POS servers,
databaseservers,andwebserverswerecompromisedmostoften.
User devices also were involved in over half of all incidents. User devices include POS devices, ATMs,
pay-at-the-pump terminals, laptops, and desktops. These devices are popular because they handle

AnExample
The following example of a breach incident is taken from the 2011 DBIR. It diagrams a chain of events
that led to a successful breach. It shows four primary threat events (E1 through E4) and one conditional
event (CE1) – an event not perpetrated by an attacker. The diagram gives a brief description of each
eventandthespecificFourAattributesassociatedwitheachevent.

AVERISDiagramofaBreachIncident
If any of these events had been thwarted, the breach would not have occurred. One advantage of the
VERIS diagram is that it is educational in terms of what could have been done to foil the breach. For
instance, security awareness and email filtering could have prevented E1 from occurring. An antivirus
product on the executive’s laptop might have stopped E2. Stopping progression between E2 and E3

might have been accomplished if egress filtering or netflow analysis had detected the backdoor. Training
and well-documented change-control procedures could have prevented the administrator’s
misconfiguration, described in the conditional event, and would have precluded the compromise of
intellectualpropertyinE4.
From Mega-Breaches to Mini-Breaches
Astrikingobservationfromthe2011DBIRistheabsencein2010ofmega-breachesofmillionsofrecords
and the rapid increase in mini-breaches. As noted earlier, in the 2004 to 2009 timeframe, 13% of all
breaches compromisedmorethan onemillionrecords,withtheaveragebreachcompromisingtwomillion
records. In 2010, 93% of all breaches compromised less than 10,000 records and averaged less than

Verizon suggests two reasons for the change in breach strategy – the success of law enforcement and
theemergenceofMalwareasaService.

TheUSSS has experiencedsignificant success in fighting cybercrime.Over the lastseveral years,USSS
agents have arrested and prosecuted more than 1,200 suspects for cybercrime involving a total of over
$500 million in actual fraud loss. In addition, because of these arrests, the USSS estimates that it has
