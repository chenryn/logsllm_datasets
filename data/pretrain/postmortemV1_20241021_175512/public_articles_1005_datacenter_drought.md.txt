How Can Datacenters Manage a Drought?
May2015
Much of the United States has been hit with a tremendous drought over the last four
years. California, Texas, and Oklahoma have been particularly hard hit, and California
hasputseverewaterrestrictionsinplace.
Datacenters are notorious users of great amounts of water to cool their
systems via massive chillers. The new NSA datacenter in Utah is
reported to use 1.7 million gallons of water per day to cool 100,000
square feet of computer equipment. Microsoft’s San Antonio datacenter

How are data centers handling this drought? For the most part, theyare

in water. But there are more efficient ways with respect to water usage such as desalination and air
economizers. These technologies may be too late for existing datacenters, but they certainly should be
consideredfornewdatacenters.
The California drought
The U.S. Drought Monitor reports that 29 of the U.S.’s 48 contiguous states are in abnormally dry or
drought conditions. California particularly has been hard hit. California’s drought started in 2011 and is
one of its worst droughts in over 100 years. 82% of California is currently classified as in extreme or
exceptionaldrought.
California wants to decrease water usage and provide new sources of fresh water. For instance, a large

California declared a state of emergency in January, 2015. Governor Jerry Brown announced the first-
ever statewide water mandate, requiring cities and towns to reduce water consumption by 25%.
Communities in which residents use more than 165 gallons of water per day must cut back their

The impact of the drought and water restrictions on the agricultural industries has been widely reported.

Use of Water Chillers
California is home to some of the country’s largest datacenters and cloud-computing facilities. Over the
years, energy consumption has gained a lot of attention, and most datacenters have made major
investments in power-efficient servers and other IT equipment. However, water consumption has not

Mostdatacentersaredesignedtousechillerstocoolwaterthat
can be distributed among their equipment to transfer heat to
the outside environment. A chiller includes a large cooling
tower that cools water through evaporation. Cold water from
the chiller is circulated through the datacenter, often through
“hot aisles” built to concentrate the heat. Heat is transferred
from the equipment to the water, thus cooling the equipment.
The resulting hot water is pumped up into a cooling tower
where it drips down a sponge-like material and is cooled by
evaporation. This process loses water to the environment. The
lostwateriscontinuallyreplenishedfromapublicwatersource.
Cooling towers have been a component of datacenter design
for many years. They are responsible for the tremendous

amounts of water needed by data centers. But are there better
options?
The answer is yes. Desalination of sea water is one such option. Along these lines, Google has used
unpotable recycled water and has even used sea water in one of its datacenters in Finland. Facebook’s

An important new technology finding increasing application is the use of ambient outside air to cool
equipment. Known as an air economizer, this technique significantly reduces the amount of water
requiredtocoolthedatacenter.Acompaniontechnologyistheuseofawatereconomizer.
WUE
ThePUE(Power UsageEffectiveness) measurehas been widelyusedtoreflectthepower efficiencyof a
datacenter. PUE is the ratio of the total power used by a datacenter to just that power used by the IT
equipment (the excess power is used for cooling, lighting, etc.). PUEs of 1.1 to 1.2 are commonly
achievedbythemorepower-efficientdatacenters.
A new measure has now been defined for water-use efficiency. It isWUE (Water Use Effectiveness). It is
the ratio of the amount of water used to cool a datacenter to the total power used by the datacenter. It is
expressedasLiters/KilowattHour(L/kWh).
RecommendationsmadebytheWUEcommitteetoreducewaterconsumptioninclude:
 ReduceITenergyuse,therebyreducingthecoolingdemandandwaterconsumption.
 Ensure the humiditycontrol system is optimized andthedatacenter is runningatthe low endof the
ASHRAE-recommendedguidelinesforhumidity(5.5°Cdewpoint).
 Optimizecooling-toweroperations(iftheyareused)toincreasecyclesofconcentration.
 Implementbestpracticeairflowmanagementtoimprovecoolingefficiency.
 Operate the datacenter at or near the ASHRAE-recommended upper limit for temperature (allow

Desalination
One solution to the water usage problem is to increase the supply of fresh water. This can be done by
desalination, converting salty sea water to fresh water. Desalination is a working technology used
throughout the world to combat the shortage of fresh water. Worldwide, desalination plants convert 1.7
billionacre-feet(that’s2x1015gallons)ofseawatertofreshwaterannually.
Desalination works via a process known as reverse osmosis. High-pressure ocean water is forced
through a membrane to remove the impurities. Desalination is expensive and requires a lot of energy. It

Transporting the fresh water is also expensive. Desalination is best used byfacilities that are close to the
ocean.
Air Economizers
Air economizers pumptheambientoutsideair across theIT equipmenttocool it. Theheatedair is simply
exhausted to the outside, and fresh air is pumped in to replace it. This technique is often referred to as
freecooling.
Air economization requires that the outside air be cool enough to perform its cooling function of heat-
producingIT equipment.However,inagood dealof the world,this is thecaseformanyhours of theday.
EvenHouston,Texas,providesover3,600hoursoffreecoolingannually(outof8,760hoursperyear).
The air can be further cooled by spraying a fine mist into it, thus cooling it via evaporation. This requires

Rackspacehas recentlyopened a new six-megawatt datacenter in London. It has nomechanicalchillers
and boasts a PUE of 1.15. It uses a free-cooling system to circulate air through a closed-loop system
serving contained hot aisles. When the air is too warm, it adds evaporative cooling with a water spray.
Waterfor this purpose is harvestedfrom theroof of thedatacenter. Rackspace’s coolingtechniques keep
thedatacenterroomtemperatureat24°C(75°F)andthehotaislesat36°C(97°F).
Water Economizers
With a water economizer, water is brought to the IT equipment with a water loop. The heat generated by
the IT equipment is transferred to the water and is then conveyed to an external water heat exchanger
whereitiscooledbytheambientairenvironment.
Water economizers are most appropriate when the outside air temperature is below 55° F (13° C) for
3,000 hours per year or more. The datacenter switches to mechanical cooling when ambient conditions
arenotappropriate.
DX Coolers
DX (direct expansion) coolers are the ones used in home air conditioners and refrigerators. They require
no water. Rather, they use a refrigerant and an evaporation coil that is cooled by ambient air to remove
theheat.

Summary
When we talk about disasters that can take a datacenter down, we usually mean earthquakes, floods,
fires, riots, and the like. Hopefully, the datacenters of the future will add “drought” to these disasters.
There are several ways to reduce the dependence of a datacenter on fresh water. However, most of
thesearemoreappropriatetobedesignedintonewdatacenters.
In addition to California, the states of Texas and Oklahoma were also devastated by a four-year drought.
However, their droughts ended suddenly and violently. Massive storms deluged the areas. Houston
received ten inches of rain in one night. The Brazos river flowing through Houston exceeded its twelve-

This is a reminder that disasters of anykind can occur without warning. Datacenters must be prepared to
