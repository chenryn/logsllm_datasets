– Our August Twitter Feed of Outages
August2015
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass.With our new Twitter presence, we don’t
have to feel guilty. This article highlights some of the tweets that made headlines in
recentdays.
FCCtoextendserviceoutagereportingtosubseasystems
The United States’ Federal Communications Commission (FCC) plans to extend mandatory
reporting on service outages to submarine cable systems. More consistent reporting on submarine
cable outages will improve the FCC's ability to spot trends, address systemic issues, and inform
policy making. If the new rules are approved, submarine cable licensees will be required to report
significant outages in detail through NORS, the system used by other communications providers to
reportoutages.

Why an Active/Passive Business Continuity Architecture is Not Good Enough
Many companies are operating with the mistaken belief that their business continuity plans will
work when the time comes or that even if they do work, the plan will be good enough to prevent
significant consequences to the company. Read this article by Gravic, Inc.’s Keith B. Evans to
find out whether such a false sense of security applies to you.

Can failover clusters offer instant BC/DR? Not so fast
DR/BC planning remains a challenging undertaking that companies must perform if they want to
survive the interruption events that may represent only 5% of outages but 100% of financial
disasters. You shouldn't deceive yourself about probabilities or frequencies of disaster events.

Avoidoutagesandachievethefabled'fournines'
Near-perfect uptime is actually possible. For some businesses, it may be too expensive to make
everything 100 percent available all of the time; but it is important that businesses recognize what
aspects of their online services must be available to ensure they run smoothly and without fault.

HowthecloudwillgetyoubetterITuptime
Last month, an issue with United Airlines' information systems grounded airplanes across the
country for over an hour. The root cause according to the airline?A failed network router. It may
come as a surprise that a Fortune 100 company with almost $39 billion in annual revenue and a $21
billion market cap can have its global operations disrupted due to the failure of a single device.
Those of us that have worked in large enterprises with legacy IT infrastructures, however, know that

@NYSEOutageShowsHowEssentialIsBusinessContinuityPlanning
Few organizations in the world move at a more blistering pace than the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE). Much of the trading action these days happens machine to machine, not
human to human. While machine trading has advantages, namely speed, it also means that a
technical glitch like the one that happened to the NYSE on July 8th can bring everything to a
screeching halt. That has led to a great deal of analysis, concern and reflection from those
who work in financial services.

Here's another of Murphy's Technology Laws: There is never time to do it right but always
time to do it over
Murphy's Law ("If anything can go wrong, it will") was born at Edwards Air Force Base in 1949 at
North Base. It was named after Capt. Edward A. Murphy, an engineer working on Air Force Project
MX981, (a project) designed to see how much sudden deceleration a person can stand in a crash.
One day, after finding that a transducer was wired wrong, he cursed the technician responsible and
said, "If there is any way to do it wrong, he'll find it." The contractor's project manager kept a list of
"laws"andaddedthisone,whichhecalledMurphy'sLaw.

Here's one of Murphy's Technology Laws: Technology is dominated by those who manage
what they do not understand
Here are two more Laws for your reading pleasure. 1) To err is human, but to really foul things up
requires a computer. 2) Computers are unreliable, but humans are even more unreliable. Any
systemwhichdependsonhumanreliabilityisunreliable.
