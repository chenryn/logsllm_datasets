HP Clarifies the Future of OpenVMS
July2013
Despite previous concerns of many in the HP community that HP’s robust OpenVMS operating system
may be headed for extinction, HP recently released an OpenVMS roadmap that indicates that OpenVMS
supportwillcontinueforyearstocome.
The OpenVMS roadmap has been laid out in some detail in a customer letter from Ric Lewis, VP and
General Manager, EnterpriseServers Business,postedto OpenVMS.org onJune 6, 2013,1and in an HP
pressreleaseissuedonJune10,2013.2Accordingtotheroadmap,thelatestversionofOpenVMS,V8.4,
runningonIntegrityi2servers,willbeprovidedfullHPsupportthrough2020andperhapsbeyond.

HP Levels of Support
StandardSupport
On the software side, Standard Support includes Engineering Support such as security updates, ECO
patchkitsandsupportforsomenewhardwarelike3PARfromOpenVMSEngineering.

For all versions of OpenVMS that are covered by Standard Support, a 24-month notification will be
provided before Standard Support actually ends. At or before the time the 24-month notice of the end of
Standard Support is given, HP will also decide and announce whether Extended Engineering Support or
Mature Product Support with Sustaining Engineering will be offered afterward (this would be a
BCS/OpenVMSEngineeringdecision).
There will then also be a 24-month notice given before the end of Engineering support. At the end of
Engineeringsupport,HPmaydecidetoofferMatureProductSupportwithoutSustainingEngineering.
Note that there is no firm ending date for OpenVMS support running on Integrity or Alpha platforms
except for OpenVMS 8.2 (see the magic words “at least” in the roadmap). HP will continue to provide
regular software updates and support for most OpenVMS versions to ensure that its thousands of
OpenVMS customers can confidently run their environments for the next several years with updates and
supportfromHPandwithconsiderationforextensions.
Clearly, if an OpenVMS legacy system currently is providing mission-critical services for an organization,
the company should seriously consider upgrading to OpenVMS 8.4 running on HP Integrity i2 servers to
gainmaximumsupportfromHP.

PriorVersionSupportwithoutSustainingEngineering
Prior Version Support (PVS) without Sustaining Engineering provides software usage assistance,
advisory and remedial support for past versions of selected operating systems and selected layered
software. It includes access to existing patches. PVS is offered in recognition that some customers have
migrationtimelinesthatlagHP’ssoftwarereleaseschedules.
ExtendedEngineeringSupport
In some cases Prior Version Support is replaced by the Extended Engineering Support (EES) offering.
EES is Engineering-level support, including new bug fixes, beyond the end of Standard Support.
Extended Engineering Support is similar to PVS-SE in that it provides engineering analysis,
troubleshooting, solutions and problem resolution. EES is a customizable support offering and may be
purchased for any OpenVMS Integrity or OpenVMS Alpha version beginning with OpenVMS Alpha
Version8.2andOpenVMSIntegrityVersion8.2-1.

HardwareSupport
HP will sell i2 Servers/Blades with OpenVMS through at least 2015, with upgrades through at least 2016.
If customers need to be able to buy new i2 hardware longer than that, they should let HP know (Alpha
saleswereextendedby6monthsbeyondtheinitialdatesasaresultofcustomerfeedback).
After that, HP Financial Services will undoubtedly offer i2 hardware in refurbished form, as they have
continued to do for Alpha servers to this day. There will be lots of i2 hardware traded in by HP-UX
customersupgradingtoi4servers,sothereshouldbenoshortageofrefurbishedi2hardware.
HP provides Hardware Support for a minimum of 5 years after the last-sale date. If i2 sales do, in fact,
end in 2015, i2 hardware support is extended to at least 2020. If circumstances (such as spare parts
stock levels) allow, and if customer demand is still present, hardware support may be available for longer
than5years,ashasbeenthecaseforVAXandAlphasystems.
LetHPHearFromYou
HP is asking customers for feedback on the 2015 and 2016 end dates for i2 Servers and upgrades. If
customers needto beable tobuynewi2Servers for longer thanthat,or if theyneedsoftwaresupportfor
a longer period of time, they should let HP know. The Alpha server last-sale dates were extended in
responsetocustomerinput.
The Long History of OpenVMS
OpenVMS is over 35 years old. Actually, it had its roots two decades before that. In the late 1950s, a
young, brilliantengineer namedKenOlsen was workingon thefirsttransistorized computer,TX-0,for the
U.S. Air Force at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratories. He came up with a way to package transistorized flip-flops,
gates,andotherdigitalcircuitsintopluggablepackagesmuchlikevacuum tubes.Kendecidedtostarthis
owncompanymakingthesedevices.Tothederision ofmanyof his associates, hegave away70% of his
company to a venture capital firm, American Research and Development, for a paltry USD $70,000. The
newcompanywasDigitalEquipmentCorporation,alsoknownasDEC.
DEC launched a series of computers, all with the acronym PDP (Programmable Data Processor), using
Ken’s “flip chips.” At that time, memory was core memory (yes – those little physical rings of ferrite
material woven together). There was no standard word size, though a standard character was 6 bits
(ASCII had yet to be defined). The PDP-1 was an 18-bit machine. The PDP-8 was a 12-bit machine. The
PDP-10 was a 36-bit mainframe. The PDP-11 was a 16-bit machine, the first to use an 8-bit ASCII
characterset.Basicmemorysizewastypically4Kwords.4
The PDP-11 morphed into the VAX (Virtual Address Extension) processor running the VMS (Virtual
Memory System) operating system in 1977. VAX was a 32-bit upgrade to the 16-bit PDP-11 to provide
virtual-memorycapabilities.VMSwasderivedfrom RSX-11M,themultiuseroperatingsystem ofthePDP-
11.
TheVAX was later portedtoDEC’s high-speed Alpha RISC chips. After Compaq acquiredDEC andthen
after HP acquired Compaq, HP ported what is now OpenVMS (VMS had been given a POSIX-like
personality)toitsItaniumserversandthentoitsi2Itaniumbladeservers.
OpenVMS split-site clusters are still today the epitome of continuous availability.5 Multiple nodes can be
distributed geographically, all running the same application and accessing a synchronized distributed

survivingnodes.
The Option of Emulation
Forthoseconcernedaboutthelong-termoutlookforOpenVMSsystems,therearetwooptions:
 Portapplicationstootherplatforms(HP-UX,HPNonStop,Linux,Windows).
 EmulatetheVAXorAlphaoncommodityhardware.
To aid in porting, HP offers support services for OpenVMS transitions to NonStop, HP-UX, Linux, and
Windowsenvironments.
Several companies offer emulation solutions, One such company is AVTware (www.avtware.com) Its
products,vtVAXandvtAlpha,arebaremetalemulatorsthatrunonstandardPCs.vtVAX andvtAlphacan
run together on the same platform and also can run in a VMware, Linux, or Windows environment.
Accordingto AVTware,the OpenVMS operating system,DEC layered software,third partypackages and
homegrownuser applications executeunmodifiedonvtVAX andvtAlpha.Nocode conversionis required.

 AlphaVM,AlphaVM-free(http://emuvm.com/)

There is also interest in the OpenVMS community in the possibility of an open-source OpenVMS-
compatible operating system development project, which would be related to OpenVMS in the same way
that Linux is related to UNIX. One such open source project already exists: FreeVMS
(http://www.freevms.net/).
Perhaps at least one of the existing emulator vendors mayproduce an Itanium emulator.However,to put
things into perspective, emulators typically come into the picture after hardware support for the original
hardware platform ends and when the performance of a host platform has grown to the point where the

Summary
Unfortunately, the press has turned HP’s announced further support for OpenVMS upside down.
Consider the article in the prestigious U.K. publication, The Register, entitled “Windows NT granddaddy

HP’s OpenVMS roadmap has set date-certain schedules for ongoing support of OpenVMS V8.4, with
possible extensions if warranted. HP has made it clear that the latest version of OpenVMS will be
supported for years to come. There is plenty of time to plan a strategy for continuing to run your
