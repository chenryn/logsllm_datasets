eBay’s Slow Response to Data Hack
July2014
eBay.com is an online auction and shopping website through which a
wide variety of goods and services are sold by its 145 million users. It
handles the financial transactions associated with each sale through its subsidiary,
PayPal.In2013,eBayhandled$215billioninsaleswithPayPal.
The eBay Attack
In early May, 2014, eBay discovered that its user database had been hacked sometime between late
February and earlyMarch. In the two intervening months, the hackers had potentiallystolen the personal
informationofeBay’s145millionusers.Thisinformationincludedcustomernames,encryptedpasswords,
emailaddresses,physicaladdresses,telephonenumbers,anddatesofbirth.
eBay claimed that no confidential financial data was compromised. All user financial data is kept in the
PayPal databases, which are on a separate secured network. All financial data is encrypted as a further
protectionagainsthacking.
Thebreach was madepossible bythe hackers obtainingthe log-incredentials of asmallnumber of eBay
employees. Log-in credentials were presumably obtained by a spear-phishing campaign in which
employees were asked to provide this information via official-looking emails. Once the hackers had a

This databreachexceeded theTargetbreachofmagnetic-stripedatafrom 110millioncustomer payment
cards during the 2013 holiday season; and it was second only to the October, 2013, Adobe hack of 152
million user accounts. This breach is a further example of the vulnerability of even the biggest and most
prepared companies. In April, AOL reported that its email services had been breached; and the attackers

eBay did post a message on its PayPal site in which the title of the message indicated that users should

Finally, two weeks after discovering the breach, eBay sent emails to its users informing them of the
breach. It listed the information that was potentially compromised, including the encrypted passwords.

There was no detail on the level of encryption so that it was not possible to determine the probability that

However, many users who went to their accounts to change their passwords were met with a “page not
found” message. eBay said that this was due to excessive volume of requests for that service and that

The Effects of the Breach
eBay has stressed that no confidential financial information was stolen. It continues to verify that it has
seen no fraudulent activity of its PayPal accounts, nor has it seen any indication of rising fraud in its
auctionmarketplace.MoneymovementswouldrequirecontrolofaneBayorPayPalaccount
However, with the potential loss of email addresses, eBay has advised its users to expect an increase in
phishing emails. Users should not click on anyemail links unless they are certain that the email is from a
trustedsource.
In addition, while hackers may not be taking money or goods out of eBay, they may be using personal
informationtotargetothersites.
Criminals are improving their ability to decrypt encrypted passwords. If users are using the same
password on other sites, especially for banking applications, it is important that they change all of these
passwords.
Summary
It is bad enough to lose information of 145 million users. It is a far greater disaster to not inform them of
