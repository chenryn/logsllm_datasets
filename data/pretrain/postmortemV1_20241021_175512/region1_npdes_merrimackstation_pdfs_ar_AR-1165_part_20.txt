swing resulted in a rapid rate of voltage decay.
Flows into Detroit exceeded 3,700 MW and 1,500
MVAr—the power surge was draining real power
out of the northeast, causing voltages in Ontario
and New York to drop. At the same time, local
voltages in the Detroit area were plummeting
because Detroit had already lost 500 MW of local
generation. Detroit would soon lose synchronism
