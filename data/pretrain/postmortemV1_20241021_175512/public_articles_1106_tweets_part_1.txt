June2016
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass.With our new Twitter presence, we don’t
have to feel guilty. This article highlights some of the tweets that made headlines in
recentdays.

From the Availability Digest: “Pathway – "HPE NonStop’s Application Environment"
At a recent fault-tolerant symposium, Digest Mng. Ed. Dr. Bill Highleyman presented an overview of
HPE NonStop systems. He stressed the immense scalability of these systems as well as their ability
to survive any single fault (and in some cases, multiple faults). Bill was struck by the interest shown
by the audience in the NonStop processmonitor, NonStop Pathway. In this Digest article, we review
the architecture of NonStop systems and explain how Pathway provides applications with fault
tolerance,scalability,andloadbalancingwithnoeffortonthepartoftheapplicationprogrammer.

ASecondBoxforSchrödinger’sCat
Using a setup with multiple optical cavities tied together with a superconducting artificial atom,
physicistsatYaleUniversity,USA,have extended one of themostcelebratedparadoxesofquantum
physics—Schrödinger’s cat, the famous hypothetical feline that, under the framework of quantum
superposition, can be both “alive” and “dead” at the same time. It turns out, according to the Yale
team, that under the right conditions, the cat can be both alive and dead in two places at once. And
the result, the researchers suggest, could help pave the way toward redundant encoding for more
reliable,fault-tolerantquantumcommunicationandcomputation.
