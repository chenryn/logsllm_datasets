Energy and theIoT: Future-proofing Britain’s energyinfrastructure
Few companies can afford to have their operations halted by unexpected downtime; but for the
energygrid,potentialpowerfailurescouldplungepartsoforevenentirecountriesintodarkness.
The cost of ensuring that Britain can switch its lights back on following a failure has grown by £12
million in the past year alone. Naturally, developed economies are not at high risk of power
blackouts, apart from in the most extreme of circumstances. However, as the current infrastructure
continues to age, industry leaders should begin to review the operational lifespan of capital
equipmenttoavoidblackoutsinthefuture.

RemoveITSystemsfromAllBranchOfficestoSaveMoneyandHardenYourSecurityPosture
The number of enterprise employees who work in remote offices and branch offices (ROBOs)
continues to rise; consequently, so do the amounts of business-critical information stored in these
locations and IT budget dollars devoted to managing these systems. Yet one figure that is not going
up is the small number of dedicated IT personnel available to staff ROBOs. This inevitably leads to
poor system performance, unreliable data backups, and system outages that all directly impact

Protectingthegrid
A dependable electricity supply touches every aspect of our society. Losing power for just a few
hours is a potent reminder. Utilities like Dominion Virginia Power (in the U.S. state of Virginia) are
conditioned to respond in the aftermath of violent weather. Yet in a world increasingly connected by
electronics, new omens of violence loom on the horizon, both physical and in cyberspace. Terrorists
and computer hackers pose hazards to a secure electricity supply. Mirroring trends globally, Virginia

Agile is no longer a long sought-after dream for businesses. It is no longer a secret weapon for
organizations that wish to stay ahead of the curve. Agile, for the most part, is the modern way of
working. By now, most organizations know the purpose of agile: to build higher-quality software
faster. But in order to ensure that quality, businesses have to make sure their testing processes can

WhenPetNet, the automatic pet feeder billed as “the smartest way to feed your pet,” burst on the
scene last year, it aimed to revolutionize the way people cared for their beloved cats and dogs.
However, despite the company packing the $149 system to the gills with smart tech and automation,
a recent server outage did the exact opposite of the device’s purpose, leaving hundreds of pets
hungry.

A Digest Oldie but Goodie: Wondering how technology impacts political races? Let's remember
the2012ORCAfailure.
The Mitt Romney campaign in the U.S. presidential elections looked forward with confidence to the
vote on November 6, 2012. Not only were many polls improving in its favor, but it had a secret
weapon that it did not disclose until just before Election Day. Orca! Orca was a massive,
technologicallysophisticated tool that was aimed atGOTV – Get Out The Vote – in the critical swing
states that would decide the election outcome. In elections that are as close as this one was
predicted to be, outperforming polls by a single point can mean that entire states and all their
Electoral votes can be won. But Orca failed. It never got off the ground on Election Day. Was this
