A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass. With our new Twitter presence, we don’t have to feel
guilty.Thisarticlehighlightssomeofthetweetsthatmadeheadlinesinrecentdays.
FromtheAvailabilityDigest:"CanHackersTakeDownOurPowerGrid?"
A recent investigation by the U.S. Congressional Research Service has determined that sensitive
computer systemsmaintaining the U.S. power grid increasinglyare being attacked. It has distributed
its findings in a report entitled “Cybersecurity Issues for the Bulk Power System.” The report warns
that hackers potentially affiliated with terrorist groups or rogue nations have the ability to insert
harmfulmalwareintotheinternalsystemsgoverningtheU.S.powergrid.

5 Important Facts about High Availability
As datacenters grow increasingly essential to enterprise applications, there is a rise in the concerns
about datacenter reliability and its availability. Redundancy is considered to be an important factor
for infrastructure reliability by industry experts, but it’s not the only factor. What is more important is
the need to keep the design and actual requirements of enterprises in sync.

How NJ Transit plans to keep trains running during a blackout
The first steps to building a back-up power system to keep sections of New Jersey Transit's
busiest rail lines running after a blackout or storm knocks out electricity were taken by NJ Transit's
board in February. Board members approved a $17 million contract to design what could be the
U.S.’s first mass transit micro power grid. "If there is a blackout, it will allow some 40 to 50 percent
of the train service to continue operating.”
