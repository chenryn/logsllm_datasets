HP NonStop Servers Migrated to x86
May2015
Fault-tolerant HP NonStop servers have come a long way from their origin as Tandem
Computers. Along the way, NonStop servers have moved from proprietaryhardware and
software to become more and more open, with a Unix-like operating system and support for modern
programming languages such as Oracle Java. HP has now taken the final step in moving NonStop
servers to commoditytechnologyby migrating these servers to an x86 architecture. The new servers are
knownasHPNonStopXservers.
Tandem Computers – The Origin of HP NonStop Servers
Forty years ago, Tandem Computers introduced the first fully fault-tolerant computer with no single point
of failure. Based on proprietary hardware and software (the Guardian operating system and the TAL
programming language), Tandem focused on providing continuous availability mainly for large financial
and telco transaction-processing applications. At one time, it became one of the fastest growing publicly
tradedcompanies.
Tandem Computers was ultimately acquired by Compaq Computers in 1997, and Compaq in turn was
acquiredbyHPin2001.TandemcomputersarenowknownasHPNonStopservers.
Tandem’s Fault-Tolerant Architecture
The original Tandem fault-tolerant architecture is still in use today in the HP NonStop servers. It is based
on a shared-nothing architecture. Up to 16 processors can be configured in a single node. The
processors are interconnected by a dual high-speed backbone fabric called ServerNet. Applications
communicate viaa messaging system –theynever usesharedmemoryor anyother kind of interprocess
communications.
If a processor fails, all of the applications are moved to surviving processors. There are two methods for
movingaprocess:
 Check-Pointed Processes – each critical process is backed up by a copy running in another
processor. The backup process is kept in the same state as the primary process via the
checkpointing of state changes. Should the primary process fail, the backup process immediately
takesoverproductionprocessing.
 ProcessMonitor–Forlesscriticalprocesses,thePathwaymonitorcandetectaprocessfailureand
restart the process in another processor. More generally, Pathway manages “server classes.” A
server class is a set of like servers running in multiple processors. Pathway distributes requests to
the various servers in a server class. If a processor fails, subsequent requests are distributed only
tothesurvivingprocesses.Pathwaycanexpandorreduceaserver-classpoolasrequired.

Tandem supported two database systems – an hierarchical file system, Enscribe, and a relational SQL
database, SQL/MP (MP for massively parallel). To guarantee no data loss, all disks in a Tandem system
are mirrored. Transactions are applied to the disk mirrors by Tandem’s Transaction Management Facility
(TMF). TMF uses the two-phase commit protocol to ensure that data changes are made to both disks of

Pathway, TMF, and the disk processes are examples of critical processes that are protected by
checkpointing.
The Tandem architecture is massively scalable because of its shared-nothing approach. Up to 255
nodes,eachcontaining16processors,canbeconnectedinanetwork andcanprovidethefullcapacityof

The Tandem architecture was awarded the coveted classification of AL4 under the IDC (International
Data Corporation) availabilityclassifications. According to this classifying method, the following levels are
defined:
 AL4 – a fault-tolerant server in which switchover to alternate resources is not perceptible to end
users.
 AL3–aclusteredserverinwhichashortoutageisrequiredtofailovertoalternateresources.
 AL2 – workload balancing in which a user request is redirected to an alternate resource following
anoutage.
 AL1–theneedtoswitchtoredundantresourcesfollowinganoutagebeforeprocessingisresumed.
According to IDC, “[Tandem Computers (now NonStop servers)] provide true fault tolerance, enabling
continuous data processing,even inthe event of the failure of one hardware or softwarecomponent.The
end user experiences no perceived interruption based on the use of fault-tolerant servers. In this level,
the combination of multiple hardware and software components allows a near-simultaneous failover to

HP NonStop Servers
Today’s HP NonStop servers follow the same architecture as the original Tandem systems. However,
therehavebeensomesignificantimprovements:
 The original Guardian operating system has been separated into a NonStop kernel on top of which
is a Guardian personality. A Unix-like personality (OSS – Open System Services) also runs on top
of the NonStop kernel. This allows NonStop systems to support applications written in Unix as well
asbeingabletorunopen-sourcesoftware.
 Modernlanguagesarenowsupported,includingC,C++,andOracleJava.
 AmodernEclipsedevelopmentenvironmentissupported.
 A new SQL database, SQL/MX, was developed which more closely complies with the SQL
specifications.

Windows. The only difference between a NonStop Itanium blade and a standard HP Itanium blade
isaninterfacetotheServerNetbackbonefabric.
Welcome to the NonStop X
At the NonStop Technical Boot Camp held in November, 2013, HP announced its plans to port NonStop
toIntel’s x86Xeonprocessor.Withthismove,NonStopwouldnowrunoncommodityhardware.Thenew
NonStopsystemwasnamedHPIntegrityNonStopX(theItaniumversionsarenowknownasHPIntegrity
NonStopi).
Several improvements came with the move to the x86 architecture. Like the NonStop
Itanium processors, the NonStop X processors are configured as standard HP blades.
However, the NonStop X blades are only half-height, allowing 16 processors to fit
within a standard HP c7000 chassis (only eight NonStop i blades can be put into a
c7000 chassis). The new blades use the Intel Xeon e5-2600v2 series of Intel
microprocessors with four cores active. Available memory sizes range from 64 GB to
192 GB per CPU, giving a per-system total of over three TB of main memory. Tests
with an Order Entry benchmark show that the new x86 NonStop processors are 50%
fasterthantheirItaniumcounterparts.
As in the earlier NonStop systems, disk and communication I/O are provided byCLIMs
(CLuster I/O Modules). Up to 56 CLIMs can be configured in one system. A
communication CLIM can handle four 10GbE Ethernet channels and one 1GbE
Ethernet channel. A storage CLIM can support 100 SAS hard disk drives or solid-state
disk drives. It can also support Fibre Channel connectivity for SAN attached storage (such as HP XP7
andHPXPP9500storagesubsystems),LT06tapedrives,andvirtualtape.
Perhaps the most dramatic improvement for the NonStop X was the replacement of the dual ServerNet
backbone fabric with a dual industry-standard InfiniBand fabric running at 56 Gbps for inter-processor
communications. InfiniBand has 25 times the capacity of ServerNet. This greatly reduces interprocessor
message and direct-attached I/O latency times. Even more important for the future, connecting NonStop
servers with InfiniBand means that they also potentially can communicate with HP-UX, Linux, Windows,
and OpenVMS systems. This opens the door, for instance, to using Linux servers to front-end NonStop
transactionprocessingsystems.
The new operating system is the L-series. The first operating-system version is L15.02. The naming
convention is L<year><month>. Thus, L15.02 is the operating-system version that was released in
February, 2015. The new operating system has been optimized to take advantage of the very high
bandwidth and low latency of InfiniBand. A compiler is provided to recompile programs to run on the
NonStopX.
A major hurdle for the NonStop X x86 operating system was that the NonStop software supports the big-
endian architecture but the x86 is little-endian. To accommodate this, NonStop X compilers store all
program variables in big-endian format. Therefore, messages sent between NonStop X and NonStop i
systemsrequirenotransformation.
A partner Beta program was introduced in early 2014. Virtually all major middleware and solutions
vendors ported their products to NonStop X to have them certified. It was gratifying that there were a
minimumofproblemsintheproductports.NonStopXproveditselftobeready.

It is expected that more systems in this family will be announced. This should include smaller systems
running on two-core x86 microprocessors as well as larger systems running on six-core x86
microprocessors. However, all systems will retain the NonStop fundamentals of fault tolerance,
availability,andscalabilitythatNonStopcustomershavecometoexpect–overthelastfortyyears.
