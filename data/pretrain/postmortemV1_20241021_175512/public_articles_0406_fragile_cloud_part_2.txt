To add insult to injury, he had never established a backup procedure, a failure that had
gone unnoticed by management. Within days, the company closed its doors; and many

Several online storage services have announced closings in the recent past, often because the
storage cloud business model was found to be unprofitable. However, unlike the stories of Digital

How Secure is the Cloud?
Is it safe to keep your data in the cloud, whether it is data that you are storing in a storage cloud

From a security viewpoint, you must assume that the privacy of your data may be violated. This

In terms of providers, who can you trust? It has been suggested that free services are probably
less trustworthy than fee-based services. The reason is that free services are often paid for by
reduced privacy and the right of the service provider to retain your data for an indefinite length of
time.Google's Gmailservice,for instance, permits automatedreview of the contents of e-mailfor

If you are using a storage cloud to host your data, the answer is simple – maintain your own
backup copy of the data. Using the storage cloud to host your data has the advantage that the
data is available anywhere, anytime - until it isn’t. Most storage cloud services allow you to
download your data for backup purposes. Do so to your internal servers or perhaps to an
independentstorage-cloudservice.
Protecting service availability is a little more difficult. One way is to run your applications in more
than onecomputecloud. If the data is stored in an independentstoragecloud,then it is available
to applications running in any other compute cloud.14 If your storage cloud data is backed up on
another storage cloud, and if you can run your applications in two or more clouds, then you can
achieve centuries of uptime. This approach multiplies the expense of cloud computing but is
probablyafractionofthecostofbuildingyourownactive/activesystem.
Another approach is to expect the cloud provider to offer continuous availability services,
probably at an additional cost. Amazon now provides such a service via its Availability Zones.15
Amazon divides the world into geographic regions, each containing several Availability Zones. A
customer can select an Availability Zone to launch an instance of his application. He can also
launch a backup instance in another Availability Zone in the same region. The database in the
backup instance is kept synchronized with the primary data database via data replication.
Followingaprimaryfailure,thebackupapplicationinstancewillassumetheIPaddressesusedby
customers;andtheapplicationwillbebackupandrunning.
To ease the impact of an outage, some cloud applications such as Google’s Gmail and
Salesforce.com’s CRM have introduced an offline capability so that users can at least perform
somefunctionsagainstdownloadeddataiftheservicegoesdown.
ImprovingSecurity
The other Achilles heel of the cloud is security. As we have discussed above, it may be wise to
avoid using the cloud to store sensitive information, whether it be personal information, corporate
banking-account details, competitive information, or any other kind of company-confidential
information.
True, technologies such as communication encryption and virtual private networks can thwart
eavesdropping of data sent between you and the cloud. But once the data is in the cloud, its
privacy cannot be guaranteed. You have lost control of it. Your best bet if you must store data in
thecloudistostoreitinencryptedform.
Transparency
An earlyproblem with cloud providers was that when their clouds went down, their staffs were so
busy trying to recover that there was no capacity to respond to their customers as to what the
situation was and when recovery could be expected. Blogs and Twitter are full of the furious
messagesthateruptedduringtheseperiods.
Both Amazon and Salesforce.com were guilty of this in their early cloud days. Along with much
improvedredundancyforavailability,bothnowmaintainastatusboardthatcustomerscanreadily
access over the web to see the status of the clouds and to get updates during outages. Amazon
maintains its status on its Amazon Web Services Service Health Dashboard
(http://status.aws.amazon.com/). Salesforce.com posts its status on its Service Performance
Historyatwww.trust.salesforce.com.

ServiceLevelAgreements
What little protection you have in the cloud should certainly be the subject of a service level
agreement(SLA).Attheveryleast,theSLAshouldcoverthefollowingtopics:16
 Theamountofuptimethatisguaranteed.
 Theprovider’sresponsetimetoanoutage.
 Thebackuppoliciesfordata–frequency,technology,andstoragelocation.
 Theprovider’sdatasecuritypolicies.
 Thepostingofstatusinformationconcerningthehealthofthecloud.
 Themaximum time that a response will be given to an email or a telephone query during
anoutage.
 ThecreditsorremunerationthatwillbepaidintheeventofanSLAviolation.
Even with a strong SLA, you should realize that it may not be of much benefit to you. Amazon’s
EC2SLA(http://aws.amazon.com/ec2-sla)guaranteesanuptimeof99.95%per year.Ifitviolates
itsSLA,it willreimburseeachcustomer10%ofthelastmonth’spayment.Look atwhatthisreally
means:
 Amazoncanbedownfourhoursper yearwithoutviolatingtheSLA.
 If you are a small user paying $20 per month for EC2 services, and if Amazon should
have a two-dayoutage, you will be reimbursed $2. Does this reimburse you for two days
oflostbusiness?

Summary
Because of the economies provided by the cloud, small to medium-sized businesses have been
the pioneers in its use, with web hosting being the first major widespread acceptance of this
technology. Larger companies are moving more slowly as they evaluate the issues associated
withavailability,security,andregulatoryissues.
However, the business model of the cloud is so compelling that major investments are being
made by service providers, equipment vendors, and consulting organizations to bring this
technology to maturity. The cloud could well become the next important paradigm shift in
corporate computing, eliminating the data center just as the power grid eliminated the need for
eachcompanytohaveitsowngenerator.
