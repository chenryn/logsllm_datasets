Megaplex Modeling: The Future of NonStop Demand
October2010
In its earlier papers, Megaplex: An Odyssey of Innovation1 and Roadmap to the Megaplex,2 the
Standish Group traced the history of the Tandem computer from its development to its current
incarnationas anHPNonStopserver.Thepapers describedthe innovations broughttocomputer
technology by the Tandem systems with their fault-tolerant multiprocessor architecture, and
StandishenvisionedanewNonStoparchitecturethatitcoinedthe“Megaplex.”
The Megaplex
In Megaplex: An Odyssey of Innovation, the Standish Group defined the Megaplex as “afabric of
resources that will provide for application services for the next 35 years.” It suggested that
NonStop technology will be the basis for the Megaplex. The Megaplex will be a fabric comprising
awidevarietyofprocessorsfromlow-endtohighlyredundantsystems.Organizations willbeable
to manage their resources by dynamically deploying services to match performance, availability,
and budgetary requirements. In the future, organizations will do away with periodic releases of
massive applications and will instead have a continuous development process of smaller units of
work.Thesemicro-applicationswillbemanagedthroughtheMegaplexfabric.
In the Megaplex, all databases will be equal and transparent. Data will reside in any database,
including Oracle, Sybase, NonStop SQL, SQL Server, and DB2. Data will be reorganized to
reflect the operational needs of the function (OLTP, ODS, BI, etc.). This reorganization will be
accomplishedbytheMegaplexwithlittleifanyinterventionfromoperationsstaff.
In the Megaplex, there will be no specific NonStop hardware. The innovative functional
technologybroughtaboutbyTandem willliveontoprovideavailability,scalability, andsecurityof
all of the resources within the Megaplex. Only that part of an application that requires high
availabilitywillberuninaNonStopenvironment,leadingtosignificantcostsavings.
The Megaplex will inherit HP’s fully automated management capability, which HP calls Business
Technology Optimization (BTO). BTO will benefit from the capabilities of NonStop, making the
Megaplexevenricherincapability.
The Megaplex will be the perfect platform for cloud computing. NonStop technology will offer
Megaplex consumers the ability to choose higher reliability and greater security for those

The Megaplex and Application Modernization
Continuing with its vision of the Megaplex, the Standish Group in its paper Roadmap to the
Megaplex introduced its vision of the Megaplex architecture. The Megaplex will be a collection of
server blades acting together as a single system using multiple types of operating systems,
databases, and other computer resources. The Megaplex will operate Linux, Microsoft Server,
NonStop OS, OpenVMS, and various types of Unix, including NonStop OSS. The Megaplex will
alsointegratedatabasessuchasOracle,Sybase,DB2,NonStopSQL,andSQLServer.
The secret for being able to take advantage of this flexible architecture for critical applications is
to decompose applications into services using the SOA (service-oriented architecture) model.
Critical services can then run on highly-available systems, and less critical services can run on
commodityservers.
Standish envisions a six-step approach to modernizing stovepipe applications to run in a
Megaplexenvironment:
1. Migrateproprietarydatabasestoindustry-standardSQLrelationaldatabases.
2. Move from green screens to modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and a web
presence.
3. Change the applications to reflect the features and functions of system-oriented
architectures.
4. Upgrade from traditional availability and disaster-recovery methods to continuous
availabilityanddisastertolerance.
5. Implement proactive security measures to replace traditional passive security and
protectionsystems.
6. Modernize operations by moving from a vertical structure to a horizontal structure using
horizontalserviceviews.
Standish submits that shifting critical applications from running purely on NonStop systems to
running in the Megaplex shifts much of the workload from higher-priced processing to lower-
priced processing without sacrificing availability. It estimates that this move can save in the order
of 40% for safety-critical applications, 35% for mission-critical applications, 33% for business-
criticalapplications,and20%fortask-criticalapplications.
The Economies of the Megaplex
In its third paper, Megaplex Modeling: The Future of NonStop Demand,3 Standish homes in on a
specific architecture for the Megaplex and compares its cost with that of more traditional
approaches.StandishenvisionssystemsofHPbladesthatcanrunanyoperatingsystem.Forthe

This means that any blade in the Megaplex can run highly critical applications in a NonStop
environmentandcanruneverydayapplicationsinaLinuxenvironment.
Keep in mind that applications have been broken into independent services (per the SOA model)
that can be called by any other services. The services comprising an application are then
classified as “black” or “white.” Black services are those that will cause great harm to an
organizationiftheyarenotavailable.Servicesthatarewhitewillhaveaminorimpact.
Two operating environments are created, one for black services and one for white services. The
black environment provides high availability – that is, it runs on NonStop servers in a

multiprocessing fault-tolerant configuration. The white environment will take the Google approach
toavailability,whichmeanslotsofcheaperLinuxbladesthatcanbereplacedwhentheybreak.
Thus, a Megaplex complex comprises perhaps hundreds or thousands of blades, some running
NonStopandsomerunning Linux.Thoughthehardwarefor allof theblades is the same,running
inNonStopblades ismoreexpensivethanrunninginLinux blades becauseof thelicensingcosts
ofthetwooperatingsystems.Thus,blackbladesaremoreexpensivethanwhiteblades.
However, blades are interchangeable. If the critical application load approaches the capacity of
the black blades, some white blades can be commandeered for black-blade service. In this way,
critical applications can easily handle peak periods. During these times, white services either run
slower because they are more heavily loaded, or they are terminated for the duration of the
critical peak load, depending upon their uses. Thus, the blades in the complex can be continually
reconfiguredtoreflecttheloadofcriticalapplications,thusmaintainingtheirperformance.
Standish then takes this one step further. Rather than configuring for peak periods with some
excess capacitythatis the usualapproach,Standishproposes thatasystem beconfiguredfor its
median use. The need for excess capacity is replaced by the capability to abort noncritical
services when necessary. Usage pricing can now be based on the actual use of black and white
services rather than onreservedcapacity, whether it is beingusedor not.Thus, pricingbasedon
preconfigured fixed configurations is replaced with capacity-on-demand and utility pricing (what
StandishcallstheNonStopDemandpricingoption).
Standish provides several pricing comparisons of the Megaplex versus other approaches. The
comparisonsarebasedon anextensiveandup-to-datedatabaseofcostandavailabilitystatistics
that Standish continually collects from industry interviews. Standish uses as an example a
payment-processing application. It assumes that 25% of the Megaplex workload is operating in
black (NonStop)mode,and75% isoperatinginwhite(Linux)mode.Thecostsincludeacquisition
costs,operatingcosts,andcostsofdowntime.
SomeofStandish’sresultsfollow:
Megaplex $1,688,000
HPNonStopBlades $2,270,000
UnixServer $2,589,000
IBMz10 $2,654,000
Linux(Googlestyle) $1,455,000
NonStopDemandMegaplex $1,574,000
Summary
Under the vision of the Standish Group, the future in computing lies in the Megaplex. The
Megaplex comprises a great number of identical server blades that can run multiple operating
systems – NonStop for services that require high availability and Linux for less critical services.
The Megaplex is sized to accommodate the median load. If the load increases, less critical
services give up their blades tocritical services tomaintaincritical serviceperformance.Capacity
ison-demand,andpricingisbasedonactualusage.
