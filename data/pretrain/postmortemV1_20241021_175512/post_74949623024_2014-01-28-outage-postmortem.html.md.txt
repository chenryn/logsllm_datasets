# 2014-01-28 Outage Postmortem

While making a change to simplify the Varnish VCL config on Fastly, we
added a bug that caused *all* requests to go to Manta, including those
that should have gone to CouchDB.

Since Manta doesn't know how to handle requests like `/pkgname`, these
all returned `403 Forbidden` responses.

Because Fastly is configured to not cache error codes, this
proliferation of 403 responses led to a thundering herd which took a bit
of time to get under control.

With the help of the Fastly support team, we have identified the root
cause and it is now well understood. The issue is that we were setting
the `req.backend` in a `vcl_fetch` function, and then calling `restart`
to re-parse the rules. However, calling `restart` will reset the
`req.backend` to the first backed in the list, which in this case
happened to be Manta, rather than the load balanced CouchDB servers.

Future changes to our Fastly VCL config will take this into account, and
always explicitly set the `req.backend` in the `vcl_recv` function, even
after a `restart`.

Also, we are setting up a separate Varnish instance to stage changes
like this, so that we can avoid being surprised by errors in our VCL
configuration.
