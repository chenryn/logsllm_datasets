Thedisaster-recoverylessonswelearnedafterKatrina
A decade ago, New Orleans and the Gulf Coast of the United States were devastated by the sixth
strongest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded.The destruction from the hurricane itself and the
subsequent flooding that put most of New Orleans underwater knocked many businesses out of
commission—and more than a few completely out of existence. Thankfully, we have learned a lot of
hard lessons in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, lessons that businesses can use to be better-

Canthecloudachieve‘zeroloss’instantrecoveryfollowinganITfailure?
Instant failover with zero data loss is the Holy Grail of maintaining a resilient IT system. With
businesses demanding more and more from their IT systems, there is less leniency toward
downtime. If you opt for cloud disaster recovery, the current state of play is that you’ll have to
compromise on either speed of recovery or data loss.
