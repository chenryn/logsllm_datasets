Boston.com, May22, 2009 – Maintenance on a major power cable led to a total electric failure in
Boston’s subway and trolley system. The power cable was redundant, and one was taken down
for testing. During testing, however, a central circuit breaker was tripped; this interrupted all
power to the signaling and control systems in the tunnels and on the tracks. With the control
center blinded, trains had to be controlled manually by employees sent to the tracks who

Kiwibank’sOnlineBankingDownforOveraDay
NetGuide, May 22, 2009 – Early Wednesday morning, New Zealand’s Kiwibank lost its web site
that provided Internet online banking services to 200,000 of its customers. It provided only
intermittent service, sometimes allowing a customer to complete a transaction, sometimes failing
in the middle of a transaction, and sometimes not allowing a customer to even log in. It took until
the following afternoon, more than 24 hours, to restore service. Kiwibank blamed the problem on
an aging .ASP web site, which has become overburdened with rapid customer growth and

PhilippinePensionersWipedOutbyOvergrownDatabase
GMA News, May 27, 2009 – The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) in the
Philippines has not been able to give Philippine pensioners a date when they can restore normal
service for pension processing. The system was taken down by a glitch in IBM software whose
malfunction was blamed on a database that has grown too large. Particularly affected were first-
time applicants for pensions. GSIS has extended its hours to 10 PM to try to manually provide
services. It has assured pensioners that the database is backed up and that no data has been
lost.GSISlegalcounselhassaidthatitmaysueIBMfortheglitch.

“Sorry,Gorgeous!Oursiteiscurrentlyhavingabadhairday.”
StorefrontBacktalk, June 10, 2009 – So said Sephora’s web site when it became inaccessible on
May 8th for three and a half hours. Sephora is a leading glamour-product retailer that hosts “the
world’s top beauty web site.” But that beauty has paled in the eye of the beholder several times
over the last few months. During the week of June 6th, Sephora’s site was up and down like a
see-saw, racking up over 16 hours of downtime. During the last quarter, Sephora’s availability
has been 97.8%. This translates to a whopping 48 hours of downtime over a three-month period.
At three million visits per month, that’s 70,000 customer visits that were lost. How much did that
cost?
