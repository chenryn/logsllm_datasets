WhatWorksforWindPowerCouldAlsoWorkUndertheSea
Jim Dehlsen, a 79-year-old wind-energy pioneer who sold one turbine company to Enron and took
another public, has spent his life thinking about the best way to make blades turn in the sky. For his
latest effort, he’s flipping a turbine upside down and plunging it dozensof metersinto the ocean in
waters that are up to 300 meters deep. There, marine currents rotate the 13.5-meter long blades to
pullpowerfromthesea.

Massive800MegaWatt-hourBatterytoBeDeployedinChina
China will soon be home to the world's largest battery. The massive power facility will provide peak
shaving, grid stability, emergency power, and load management to the Dalian peninsula in
northeastern China. According to the US Department of Energy, the largest battery-based energy
storage system currently in operation is a 50 MW (300 MWh) sodium-sulfur battery in Japan.The
largest one in development is the100 MW (400 MWh) peaker plant in California. It will use a battery
technologythat's yet to be determined. And now,UniEnergy Technologiesannounced a partnership
with Rongke Power, which will build and deploy a 200 MW (800 MWh) energy storage system
featuringRongkePowervanadiumflowbatteries.

TestingfailurecauseddowntownSeattlepoweroutage
Thousands of downtown Seattle, Washington (USA) homes and businesses lost power on 25 May
because of an engineering oversight by a Seattle City Light utility crew. Relays detect electrical
faults and signal circuit breakers to open to prevent power surges. Relay testing is routine, and a
crew was testing new relays to ensure they worked with older ones when the failure occurred. Crew
members failed to block backup circuit breakers; so when they sent the test signal, it tripped those
breakersanddroppedpowerfromtwohigh-voltage,115-kilovolttransmissionlines.
