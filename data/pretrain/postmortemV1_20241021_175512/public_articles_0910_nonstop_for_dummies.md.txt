HP NonStop for Dummies
October2014
Finally! A Dummies book for HP NonStop systems is here. Authored by Werner Alexi,
Thomas Burg, and Bill Sempf and published by Wiley for comForte 21 GmbH, “HP
NonStop for Dummies” is a high-level but educational view of all things that make
NonStop servers nonstop. NonStop servers recover automatically from any single fault and even from
multiple unrelated faults. Consequently, these self-healing systems experience uptimes measured in
years.
The NonStop hardware and software architectures that lead to this level of
availability are described in the book, followed by the ease with which applications
can be developed for such systems. The ability to integrate NonStop systems with
other enterprise systems is an important attribute, and these capabilities are
summarized.Finally(asinallDummiesbooks),alistoffurtherreferencesisgiven.
This book is for those companies considering NonStop systems for their mission-
critical applications, for those users new to the NonStop servers, for those
responsible for managing or operating NonStop systems, and even as enjoyable
readingforthoseexpertinthistechnology.
Thebookisorganizedintofivechapters:
1. What is HP NonStop?
In Chapter 1, the authors present the demands for IT systems with extraordinary availability capabilities.
Many mission-critical systems require the NonStop fundamentals of data integrity, reliability, availability,
and serviceability (RAS). Data integrity means that the database is always consistent and correct. A
reliable system is one that will not return any result rather than return a wrong result or corrupt the
database. Availabilityrequires that application downtimebemeasuredas seconds or minutes per year. A
serviceable system is one that can be managed easily even in an environment of other interoperating
systems. Inmanydefinitions, the “S” in RAS is for scalability, also an important characteristic of NonStop
servers,whicharelinearlyscalableoverhundredsofprocessors.
NonStop systems were born as Tandem systems in the mid-1970s, fathered by Jimmy Treybig, an
entrepreneur from HP.Tandem Computers was acquiredbyCompaqin1997, whichinturn was acquired
byHPin2002.Havingreturnedhome,TandemserverswererenamedNonStopserversbyHP.
The high availabilityof NonStop systems results from close cooperation between hardware and software.
Every component in an HP NonStop server is duplicated with instantaneous failover to a backup
component should one fail. This includes not only hardware components such as processors, memory,
I/O channels, power supplies, and cooling but also all software components such as system and
application processes. As a consequence, a NonStop server is self-healing in the presence of anysingle

fault and many multiple faults. If a component fails, no one notices (except for the IT staff that must
correctthefault).
A major factor in creating high availability is that the entire NonStop environment is a tightly integrated
suite. There is no need to merge and manage separate hardware, operating system, database, cluster
management,andsystemmanagementcomponents.
2. A Platform Overview
ThearchitecturalconceptsbehindNonStopsystemsareexploredinChapter2.
Share-NothingArchitecture
AfundamentaldesignconceptinNonStopsystemsisshare-nothing.Nohardwareorsoftwarecomponent
shares a common subcomponent with any other facility. Therefore, the failure of any component in the
systemwillnotaffecttheintegrityofanyothercomponent.
The two core concepts behind share-nothing are processes and messages. A process is a program
runninginacomputer.Aprogrammayberunningasseveralnamedprocesses.
In most applications, processes must communicate with each other. This is often accomplished via
pointers to buffers insharedmemoryor byAPI (applicationprogramminginterface) calls.However, these
techniques link processes tightly together so that the failure of one may cause the failure of another. In
NonStop systems, system and application processes are loosely coupled. They communicate with each
otherviamessages.
Messaging
A process has a mailbox, called $RECEIVE, into which other processes mayplace messages requesting
service. A process reads messages from its mailbox, provides the appropriate service, and responds to
the message initiator. For instance, an application process may send a message to a system disk
process asking it to read a specific record from the database. The disk process will perform the read and
willreturntherecordtotherequestingprocess.
ProcessPairs
Critical system processes are implemented as process pairs. One of the processes in the process pair is
theactive process,andthe other is thebackupprocess.Eachruns in adifferentCPU sothatthe process
pair survives a CPU failure. If the active process fails, the backup process instantly assumes
responsibilityforprocessinganymessagessenttotheprocesspair.
AdvantagesofMessaging
ThecoremessaginginfrastructurebringsmanyadvantagestoNonStopsystems:
 The two processes can be in different CPUs or even in different systems separated by hundreds of
miles.
 A backup process of a process pair can instantly start processing request messages should the
primaryprocessfail.
 Faultsineitherthesendingorreceivingprocesswillnotcausecorruptionoftheotherprocess.
 Performance problems can be identified easily by monitoring the resource consumption of individual
processes.

TheNonStopOperatingSystem
Guardian
The heart of the NonStop operating system is called Guardian. Guardian supports all modern
programminglanguages,includingCOBOL,C,C++,andJava.
OSS
OSS (Open System Services) is a Unix-like personality that runs on top of Guardian. Most Unix open-
source applications and tools that are available in the Unix world run on OSS. To the experienced Unix
user, OSS appears to be Unix. However, it is Unix with all of the underlying availability characteristics of
theNonStopsystem.
TheNonStopDatabases
NonStopsupportsthreedatabases–Enscribe,NonStopSQL/MP,andNonStopSQL/MX.
Enscribe
The Enscribe database was introduced long before SQL became a standard. It supports several file
types:
 Key-sequencedfilescontainingvariable-lengthrecordsaccessiblebykeys.
 Relativefilescontainingfixed-lengthrecordsaccessiblebyrecordnumber.
 Entry-sequencedfilescontainingvariable-lengthrecordsappendedtotheendofthefile.
 Unstructuredfilesthatareorganizedbytheapplication.
Enscribe file names are very limited. They are eight characters in length with some optional qualifiers.
OSS files use the Enscribe facility but add the lengthy and flexible Unix file and directory naming
conventions.
ThoughSQLdatabases havegenerallyreplaced old databasesystems suchas Enscribe, Enscribe is still
usedextensivelyintheNonStopworld,especiallybyolderapplications.
SQL/MP
SQL/MP (massively parallel) was the first truly relational database on the NonStop platform. Using
NonStop’s message-based architecture, SQL/MP allows disk processes and files to be distributed over
multipledisks,multipleprocessors,andevenmultiplesystems.
SQL/MPisstillinheavyuse,thoughitisnotfullycompatiblewiththeANSISQL standard.For instance,it

SQL/MX
SQL/MX is the current and most highly supported database on the NonStop platform. It provides highly
increasedcompatibilitywiththeANSISQLstandardandmakesfulluseoftheOSSpersonality.
TMF
The NonStop Transaction Management Facility (TMF) is responsible for managing transactions being
written to anyof the NonStop databases. TMF provides an audit trail of all database changes that can be
used to roll back transactions or to recover the database in the event of a failure. The audit trail also

provides a source of changes for replication of files and tables to other systems. TMF guarantees the
ACIDpropertiesofalltransactions.
Pathway

NonStopActive/ActiveSystems
The ultimate in continuous availability is achieved by running two (or more) geographically separated
NonStop systems in an active/active configuration. Both systems are running the same application and
are sharing the transaction load. Their databases are kept synchronized via data replication. Should one
system fail, all that needs to be done is to reroute all transactions to the surviving system. Recoveryfrom

Active/active NonStop systems have supported mission-critical applications around the world with no
downtimeoverdecadesofoperation.
KeyBenefitsofHPNonStopSystems
HP NonStop systems offer common standards with uncommon advantages, especially in the area of
high- and continuous availability. When the cost of downtime is considered, NonStop systems offer low
total cost of ownership (TCO) for mission-critical systems. Their use can be found in cloud/hybrid
configurations,wheretheyprovideafault-tolerantdatabaseforapplicationsrunninginthecloud.
HP plans to extend the standardization of NonStop servers by porting NonStop to their x86 Blades.
Coupled with HP’s excellent customer support via their global support centers, HP NonStop servers are
thechoiceformission-criticalsystemsthatsimplycannotfail.
3. Developing Software for HP NonStop
The development life cycle for NonStop systems is much like that for other systems and is described in
Chapter 3. Application development and maintenance can be accomplished with modern languages,
cross-compilers,anddebuggersthatarecommonlyusedonLinux,Unix,andWindowssystems.
IDEs
Program development can be performed on a NonStop system, or it can be done on a PC with cross-
compilers. Compilers and linkers are available for C, C++, COBOL, and even the original Tandem
programminglanguage,TAL(TandemApplicationLanguage).
The developer’s IDE (integrated development environment) of choice can be used to code, cross-
compile, and debug applications. Supported IDEs include the Microsoft IDE and Eclipse. Eclipse is the
current IDE of choice and is actively supported on NonStop by HP. Consequently, Windows, Linux, and
UnixdeveloperscaneasilybecomeproductiveNonStopapplicationdevelopers.

Java
Java has been supported on NonStop for quite some time. In one form, HP offers the SASH stack –
Spring, Axis2, MyFaces, Hibernate – that is the same as that found on Unix boxes. Also, a NonStop
version of JBoss is available. JBoss replaces sockets with Pathway interfaces to take advantage of all of
theNonStopfundamentals,includingTMFtransactionmanagement.
TheDevelopmentTeam
A good NonStop development team is like any other because commonly available languages and tools
are supported. In addition to seasoned developers, the team should include one or two NonStop
specialists to manage the architecture of the application so as to take most advantage of the NonStop
fundamentals.
Writing efficient code for NonStop systems means optimizing throughput, response time, and resource
consumption. It does not require platform-specific features such as creating process pairs or invoking no-
waitedprogramming.ThisisalladdressedbyPathway.
MaintainingExistingApplications
ModernizingApplications
Many existing applications were written decades ago and use green screens. They lack a modern GUI,
contemporary security features, and integration capabilities with other enterprise servers and
applications. There are many third-partyproducts to help the development team add these capabilities to
legacyapplications.
PortingApplicationstoNonStop
In the past few years, many applications have been ported from other systems to NonStop. These
migrations required both database and application migrations. HP and its independent software vendors
(ISVs)provideawealthofexpertiseandtoolstodothisefficiently.

Safeguard is a securityframework closely integrated into the NonStop operating system. It provides user
management and the capability to create and manage Access Control Lists (ACLs). However, many
desirable features are not provided by Safeguard. They are offered instead by a plethora of third-party
tools.

Additional security features available from NonStop ISVs include in-place and in-transit encryption, two-
party authentication, checking the integrity of system and application object files, and checking a system
forPCIandHIPAAcompliance.
IntegratingNonStopwithOtherSystems
CommunicatingwithOtherSystems
NonStop systems lend themselves very nicely to multitier applications involving other systems. This is
due to their architecture, which isolates user interfaces, application logic, and database functions into
looselycoupledsubsystemsthatinteractviamessaging.
NonStop supports SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), which allows NonStop server-class functions
to be bundled and made available to external systems via standard interfaces using XML message
passing.
REST (Representational StateTransfer) uses HTTPas alighter-weightmethodfor integratingsystems.It
has become the de facto standard for integrating mobile applications, important in the NonStop world for
mobile payment services and telecommunications. REST frameworks for NonStop are available from
severalISVs.
OperationsManagement
Several products help manage a NonStop system in a mixed environment. EMS (Event Management
Subsystem) is the main system event-message hub that reports all problem and status messages to a
commonlog.EMScanfeedHP’s ArcSight,aSIEM(securityinformationandeventmanagement)system,
to integrate EMS with event messages from other systems in the enterprise. This is useful when
monitoringforsecuritybreaches.
Several other products are available to monitor a NonStop system along with other enterprise systems
underasingleumbrella.TheyincludeNagios,anopen-sourcemonitoringtool,andTivoli.
FileTransfer
NonStop supports the venerable Internet File Transfer Protocol (FTP) as well as the secure file transfer
protocolsSFTPandSFTP/SSL.
Messaging
Asynchronous messages may be sent between NonStop systems and other systems via JMS (the Java
MessagingSystem),byIBM’sWebSphere,andbymanythird-partyproducts.
