This is the message that Curtis Preston delivers in his book, Unix Backup and Recovery.1
Preston has been involved in backup and recovery for much of his professional career. In his
book, aimed at heavy-duty business Unix systems and the databases they run, he passes on all

Every user dreads the inevitable system crash. The consequences of downtime and data loss
range from inconvenient to catastrophic. Minimizing this impact requires serious planning and
testing of backup and recovery procedures before catastrophe hits. This book is an invaluable
referenceforproperplanningoftheseprocedures.

Planning
The author begins his book with an in-depth discussion of planning the backup and recovery
process
TheDisasterRecoveryPlan
The place to start backup and recovery planning is the Disaster Recovery Plan. The elements of
thisplanshouldinclude:
 Decide what is an acceptable loss. Backup is like an insurance policy. You want to pay
for the coverage you need but no more. Some data may be so critical to corporate
survival that cost is not an issue. The loss of other data may be tolerable but will have a
costassociated withitsloss–acostthatshouldnotbeexceededbyoverzealous backup
policies.

 Back up everything. You never know what you might need. Not only should files and
databases be backed up, but so should scripts, metadata, operating systems, and the
instructions needed to get them back. In this regard, exclude lists are good, include lists
are bad. It is too easy to forget to add something to an include list. This can result in the
failuretoeverbackupthatitem.
 Organize everything. Mark every backup volume (e.g., tape) with a unique identifier.
Keep an up-to-data inventory of the exact location of every file, database, and other
object. This catalog will change with every backup. Keep this catalog not only online but
alsoinaplacesafefromdisaster.
 Protect against all disasters. There are disasters other than natural disasters, such as
usererror,system-stafferror,hardwarefailure,diskdrivefailure,softwarefailure,system-
wide failure, electronic vandalism and theft, and the loss of archives. Each of these must
beprotectedagainst.
 Document what you have done. The recovery plan should be documented so that any
qualified person can follow it after an outage or a disaster. Don’t count on the availability
ofcertainstaffmembersfollowinganunplannedoutage.
 Test, test, test. A Disaster Recovery Plan that has not been thoroughly tested is not a
plan;itisaproposal.Makesurethatthetestcoverseveryfacetoftherecoveryprocess.2
TheBackupandRecoveryPlan
Once you have completed the Disaster Recovery Plan, you have a good feel for how important
eachdataobjectistoyouroperation.Nowisthetimetodecideexactlyhowyouaregoingtoback
up different classes of data and how you will restore them following a loss. Issues to consider
include:
 Decide what to back up. This is a direct result of the first step in the Disaster Recovery
Plan – deciding what an acceptable loss is. It is a good idea to also include the details of
the system hardware and software configurations in the event that one or more servers
mustbereplaced.
 Decide when to back up. For each class of data to be backed up, when should full
backupsbemade?Incrementalbackups?Snapshots?
 Decide how to back up. Is the intent to implement a high-availability solution to maintain
user services consistently, a disaster-recovery solution to recover from a total system
failure, or both? Choose the backup utilities to satisfythe protection and cost parameters
for each type of data. Automate the backup procedures as much as possible within cost
constraints.Planforexpansion–itisinevitable.
 Storing the backups. What will be used for onsite storage of backup media? Will backup
volumes be sent to offsite storage? Will backup data sets be replicated to an offsite
system?
 Test the backups. Don’t wait for the disaster which requires that you restore data or the
system only to find out that your backups don’t work. Test everything often. This is
probablythemostimportantpartoftheBackupPlan.

 Follow proper development procedures. New backup procedures are as prone to errors
as are new application programs. Test changes to these procedures thoroughly on a
development system. Roll them out cautiously. Be prepared to revert to the previous

Everything You Need to Know About Backup and Recovery Utilities
The meat of Unix Backup and Recovery follows the above discussion of proper planning. The
book focuses on the most popular backup and recovery utilities. For each, the detailed syntax is
explained, including discussions of the syntactical nuances between different versions of the
sameutility.

since theychange frequently. Instead, he suggests attributes to look for in a commercial product.

DatabaseBackupandRecovery
Database backup and recovery presents some of the greatest challenges to system
administratorsandtodatabaseadministrators(DBAs)alike.
Preston has seen a serious disconnect between system administrators, responsible for backing
up and restoring the file systems and other data objects, and DBAs, responsible for backing up
and restoring databases. The technologies are substantially different, and one group typically
doesnothaveadeepunderstandingofwhattheothergroupdoes.
He attempts to bridge this gap in the book. The information described up to this point certainly
gives DBAs a good feel for what a system administrator does. He now launches into some detail
concerningthetechnologyofdatabasesandtheDBAs’responsibility.
He then goes into great detail (50 to 75 pages each) on three database backup and recovery
facilities:
 Informixbackupandrecoveryusingontapeandtheneweronbar.
 OraclebackupandrecoveryusingEBUorRMAN.
 SybasebackupandrecoveryusingtheBackupServerutility.
