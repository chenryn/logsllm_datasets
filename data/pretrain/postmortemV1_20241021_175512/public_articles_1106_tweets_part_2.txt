HasBART'scutting-edge1972technologydesigncomebacktohauntit?
The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is a public transportation system serving San Francisco,
California, and the surrounding region. Back in 1972, BART’s technology was considered cutting-
edge. Designed to move 100,000 people per week, BART now carries 430,000 people per day.
Numerous issues recentlyhave created havoc for riders, and it has become apparent that what was
once“space-ageinnovation”nowisinneedofaseriousoverhaul.

The computer network that serves almost all executive branch agencies in the U.S. state of Virginia,
went dark Saturday morning, May 21st. By noon, five hours later, service had been restored to
affected agencies, thanks to a repair using a part from a test system by Northrop Grumman, which
owns and operates the data center serving the vast state bureaucracy. But the state overseer, the
Virginia Information Technologies Agency, is still looking for answers about why the part failed and
whythebackupsystem“didnotoperateasdesigned.”

IBM allows free access to quantum processoronline
Quantum computing is widely seen as an evolution of computer technology that may allow for much
faster calculations than today's machines. IBM's quantum processor is located in its TJ Watson
Research Centre in the U.S. state of New York. Quantum processors are notoriously sensitive, so it
is being kept at supercooled temperatures in a cryogenic refrigerator. People wishing to access the
processors must request an invitation. A spokesman for IBM said the invite system was to prevent
botsfromswarmingthesystem.

FromtheAvailabilityDigest:"BankChooses“Sizzling-Hot-Takeover”DataReplication"
For the past eight years, a tier 1 regional bank serving a major resort island was using an ACI
BASE24 Classic financial transaction switch to manage its network ATMs and POS terminals. For
business continuity, its BASE24 system was running in an active/passive mode on a pair of HPE
NonStop S-Series servers. Early in 2015, the bank found that it needed to upgrade these servers,
which along with the operating system and application software, were nearing their end-of-support
life. The bank made the decision to migrate its BASE24 system to a pair of NonStop NS-Series
servers, again running as an active/passive pair. The bank also decided to replace its current data
replication product with HPE Shadowbase solutions due to cost issues and to optimize its business
continuity failover time for system outages, whether scheduled or unscheduled. Furthermore, this
replacement positioned the bank to take advantage of the Shadowbase sizzling-hot-takeover (SZT)
facility,whichcantypicallyreducefailovertimetoafewseconds.
