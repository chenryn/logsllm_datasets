American Eagle’s Eight-Day Outage
September2010
It’s one thing to have a major system go down for four hours while it is being recovered. It is
anotherthingforathree-billiondollarretailertoloseits entirewebsiteforeightdays.Thatiswhat
happenedtoAmericanEagleOutfittersinlateJuly.
American Eagle had done everything right. It had backups of backups. It had a disaster-recovery
site. It had detailed business-continuity and disaster-recovery plans. So what went wrong?
Testingandverification.
American Eagle Outfitters
American Eagle Outfitters (www.ae.com) is a Pittsburgh-based,
multibillion dollar retailer. 12% of its revenues come from its apparel
web sites including American Eagle for teenagers, Aerie for women,
and77kidsforbabiesandtoddlers.
Its online web operations are outsourced to IBM. American Eagle
also provides a mobile web site, managed by Usablenet, that
providesaccesstoitsproductsfromcellphonesandPDAs.
The Disaster
During the evening of Monday, July19, 2010, American Eagle’s web site camecrashing down. It
was reported that the crash was caused by the loss of a major storage subsystem at the IBM
hostingcenter.ThefailedstorageheldagreatdealofthecriticalinformationneededbyAmerican
Eagletoprocessweborders.
No problem. American Eagle was prepared for server and storage failures such as this with full
backup facilities. However, as the IBM staff attempted to fail over to the backup system, the
secondary storage system failed as well. The joint failure of the primary and secondary disk
driveshasaprobabilityofoccurrenceofmuchlessthanamilliontoone,butithappened.

Restoration of 400 gigabytes of data was started. However, for some reason, the staff was only
able to get a restoration rate of one gigabyte per hour. At this rate, it would take over two weeks
to restore the database. After much tuning, the restoration speed got up to five gigabytes per
hour;buttherestoreskeptfailing.
No problem. American Eagle was prepared even for these unlikely eventualities. It had built a
remote disaster-recovery site, and IBM staff initiated a failover to the remote site. However, they
soon discovered that the remote site was not yet operational - a big surprise to American Eagle,

The outage couldn’t have happened at a worse time. The start of the back-to-school heavy

The Timeline
The timeline of American Eagle’s communication with its customers tells the story of its initial
optimism,itsearlyfrustrationwiththerecoveryefforts,anditsultimateresignationtothedisaster.
When the website crashed earlyduring the evening of Monday, July19th, visitors to the site were
greetedwithanoptimisticmessage:
“Sorry. We need a few minutes to reorganize our closet. We promise to be back in a bit with
evenmore.”
Two days later, American Eagle had come to the realization that it had better do something to
appeaseitscustomers.ItpostedthefollowingofferonWednesday,July21st:
“We’remakingupdatestooursites.FreeShippingonuswhenwe’reback,thruJuly25.”
However,fullfunctionalitytothewebsitewasnotrestoreduntilJuly27th.
ByThursdaymorning,July22nd,the websitewasbackonline withlimitedfunctionality.Purchases
could be made, but several ancillary services such as order tracking and wish lists were still not
operational.OnFridaymorning,July23rd,thefollowingmessagegreetedvisitorstothesite:
“We’re still working through some issues, but you’ll be able to shop! Everything should be
completely fixed very soon. Thanks for hanging in there. Stuff we’re still working on: Order
Tracking,RegisteredInformationFunctionality,WishList,OrderHistory.”
On Tuesday afternoon, July 27th, IBM informed American Eagle that all services had been
restored; and the warning notices came down. As a parting good-will offer, on Friday, July 30th,

“Thanks for hanging in there while our site was down … This Friday and Saturday (7/30 &

This three-billion dollar retailer had been down for eight days with lost revenue and untold loss of
itscustomerbase,eventhoughithadinvestedheavilyindisasterrecovery.
Why Not Switch to its Mobile Site?
Like somanycompanies with an online presence, American Eagle maintains a mobile website in
addition to its primary online site.1 The mobile website provides convenient access for browsing
andpurchasingfromacellphoneorPDA.

So whynotpostamessageon its online website that simplypoints users tothe mobile website?
The pages are not as rich in content, but customers could still browse American Eagle products
andplaceorders.
The problem is that there are two ways to build a mobile website. One is to have a completely
autonomous web site with its own database. The online website and the mobile website
databases are synchronized via replication. Thus, they are independent; and one can substitute
for the other in an emergency provided each has sufficient capacity – the ultimate active/active
architecturethatcomesforfree.
Unfortunately,AmericanEagleelectedtobuilditsmobilesiteasaproxytoitsonlinewebsite.The
mobile site uses the database of the primary site. Should the primary site go down, the mobile

Some marketers do not like to fail over to a mobile site since they feel that the displays are too

Lessons Learned
Many lessons can be learned from the American Eagle disaster. Perhaps the foremost lesson is
that disaster-recovery plans and business-continuity plans are not very effective if they are not
tested periodically. Clearly, this was the case for American Eagle. For one, it appears that the
restoration of the database from magnetic tape was never tested, which would have uncovered
the slow restoration problem. For another, American Eagle clearly never tested failover to the
disaster-recovery site, or it would have discovered quite quickly that the disaster-recovery site
wasnotyetoperational.
All too often, companies take shortcuts when it comes to failover and recovery testing because
such testing is considered to be too complex, too expensive, and too risky. But the expense of a
failoverfaultcandomajordamagetoacompany’sbottomline.
However,shouldn’tthistestinghavebeentheresponsibilityofIBM,whichhadcontractuallytaken
responsibilityfor the website?IBMis oneof thepowerhouses intheoutsourcingbusiness.Butas
capable as it is, it has had a series of failures such as this one. Just two weeks before American
Eagle’s debacle,DBSBank,thelargestbank inSingapore,lostallof its onlinebanking,ATMand
credit-card services, and branch operations for nine hours when an IBM employee used an
outdated procedure to replace a cable. DBS Bank had outsourced its data-center operations to
IBMin2002for$850million.2
In 2006, the State of Texas outsourced to IBM a major migration of 27 agencies to two data
centersfor$863million.Themigrationwassupposedtohavebeencompletedintwoyears.Now,
four years later, onlyfive agencies have been fullymigrated. Furthermore, the state has accused
IBMoffailingtomakerequiredbackups.Texasisnowrebiddingthecontractfour years beforeits

This leads to the second important lesson. A company can never give up ownership,
responsibility, or governance of its systems and data to another service provider. There should
have been periodic dry runs of all backup and failover procedures properly witnessed by

operational. Even a company as competent and experienced as IBM needs to be periodically
auditedwithrespecttoitsresponsibilities.
This is a clear indication of the risk of using a managed hosting firm rather than a company site
for criticalIT functions.Inthis economy, the auditing of aservice provider maynotbe high onthe
CIO’s prioritylist.After all,theSLAguarantees thatthe expectedlevelof servicewillbeprovided.
Right?
Not necessarily, as was shown in this case. Speaking of SLAs, it is not known whether American
Eagle got hit with the SLA “gotcha.” SLAs are typically written so that in the event of a major
outage, the customer is entitled to a partial or full refund of the hosting fee for that period. There
is no provision for compensating the customer for loss of business. There have been many
reports of small online stores being taken out of business for days due to a hosting-site failure,
andthetotal of theremunerativedamages receivedbythoseretailers was therefundof their $10
