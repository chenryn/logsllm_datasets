The American “Big One”
The earthquake that is threatening the American Pacific Northwest is caused by the Cascadia Zone
runningalongtheupper Pacific Northwestcoastof NorthAmericafrom Oregonto Canada.TheCascadia
Zone is an area where two large tectonic plates seem to be stuck and are pressing on each other.

Based on soil samples, over the last 10,000 years the Cascadia Zone has spawned 41 massive
earthquakes, an average of one every 244 years. The last such earthquake occurred in 1700, over 300
yearsago.Wearedue.

Japan’s Big One
Japan recently experienced its “big one.” It occurred on Friday, March 11,
2011,andhasbecomeknownastheGreatEastJapanEarthquake.Itwasa
magnitude 9.0 earthquake centered 43 miles east of northeast Japan at a
depth of 19 miles. It was the most powerful earthquake to ever hit Japan
and was the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since record
keeping began in 1900. It moved the main island of Japan eight feet to the
east.

reactors in the Fukushima nuclear power plant when flooding disabled their

the loss of the power plants reduced the availability of electric power across
Japan.
The World Bank has estimated that the economic cost of the Great East Japan
EarthquakewasUSD$235billion,makingitthecostliestnaturaldisasterinworldhistory.
Japan’s Earthquake-Proof Data Centers
Japan is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. It sits on top of four tectonic plates that cause frequent
earthquakes,manylarge.Therefore,Japanhasstrictbuildingcodestoprotectlargebuildingsintheevent
ofanearthquake.
Japan’s building codes require a number of earthquake resiliency measures for building design. Many
datacenters exceededthesecodes,afactaccounting for thehighsurvivabilityof datacenters in theface
of theGreatEastJapanEarthquake.SmartconstructionandgoodplanningallowedJapan’s datacenters
toescapevirtuallyunharmed.Nonewereseverelydamagedorknockedoffline.
The firstrequirement of the Japanese building codes is that data centers (in
fact, all large buildings) be built on giant shock absorbers. These are
isolators (called base isolators) made from metal and rubber on which
buildingsfloatwhilethegroundunderneaththemshakesfromsidetoside.
Furthermore, isolated raised-floor systems are used to further stabilize the
computer-equipment rooms. The floor-level isolators further reduce shaking
inthecomputerroom.
Finally, rack-level isolators substantially remove whatever shaking is left,
protectingtheequipmentintherack.
All server racks, cooling equipment, and other equipment are secured firmly
to the floor. Many U.S. data centers simply place their racks on the floor
wheretheycanskidaroundduringanearthquake.
During the Great East Japan Earthquake, shock absorbers proved to be most effective at the building
level. Someisolators atthe rack level did not work quiteas well. However,reports indicated thatonlyfive
serverracksinallofJapan’sdatacentersweredamaged.
Fighting for Power
Surviving the shaking of the earthquake was just the first problem faced by data centers. The failure of
the three Fukushima nuclear reactors seriously reduced the amount of power available to all Japanese
businessesandhomes.

However, as power was restored, data centers faced another challenge. Because of the shortage of
power, the Japanese government ordered that all facilities consuming more than 500kWh of power
reduce their consumption by 15%. The data centers objected to this, pointing out that they had already

reduced their power consumption as part of their energy-efficient projects and couldn’t reduce their

0% to 15% based on how much they had reduced energy usage the year before. However, the fines for
violationswerehigh–USD$12,500perhourforeachhouroverthelimit.
The Need for Water
Many of the Japanese data centers used water coolers to cool their computer equipment. After the
earthquake,water wasinshortsupplyinsomeareas.Asaresult,datacentersarenowmovingtofree-air
cooling that requires no water. Free-air cooling is being used to supplement or replace the data-center
watercoolers.2
The Move to Colocation and Clouds
Another mitigating factor that led to the minimal damage was that 70% of Japan’s data centers are in the
Tokyo region. There are no data centers in the northeastern region of the country since that is where
earthquakes and tsunamis are expected. Nevertheless, many companies are moving their data centers
furtherwest,whichisconsideredthesafest.
Osaka in southern Japan is rapidly expanding as a data-center location. Data centers are being built
there to back up facilities in Tokyo and elsewhere. They are served by a different power company than
facilitiesinTokyo.
A number of local government agencies and businesses lost all of their computer equipment and most of
their records in the tsunami. Consequently, there is now a big movement to collocate their facilities in a
data center. It is clear that data centers are best prepared for disasters. Nearly all companies in Japan

Other Problems
Other problems also faced the data centers. Communications were affected more than expected. Social

Half of the cablecapacityrunning across the Pacific Ocean was damaged. Ittook several weeks tomake
repairs.
Summary
Many lessons can be learned from the Japanese experience with the Great East Japan Earthquake. The
first lesson is not to build data centers in earthquake-prone areas. However, there are alreadymanydata
centers in these areas. They all should have a remotely located backup data center in a safe area, far
fromwherethesameearthquakecouldaffectbothdatacenters.
If a data center is to be built in an earthquake zone, it should be built according to earthquake building
codes. This includes building, floor, and equipment isolators to reduce the effect of shaking on the IT
equipment.Furthermore,allequipmentshouldbeattachedfirmlytothefloor.

A data center in such an area must be prepared for limited power availability for a long period of time. It
