There are over 800 sessions in the Discover 2011 schedule. In this issue, we highlight some of
thesessions thatdeal with availability. Manyaregeneric sessions,andweprovidetheabstracts..
Others are product-oriented, and the abstracts for these sessions follow the generic session
abstracts.2 Breakout sessions are one hour in length. Hands-on labs are scheduled for 90
minuteseach.
Dr. Bill Highleyman, Managing Editor of the Availability Digest, will present two breakout
sessions.Hisabstractsaregivenfirstinthefollowingsessionlisting.
General Availability Sessions
3888-Soyouthinkyourdatacenterissafe?
Dr.BillHighleyman,AvailabilityDigest
One of the first steps in a business continuity plan is risk assessment, in which all known risks to
the business are detailed. However, experience has shown that many data centers are taken
down by unforeseen events. In this session, participants will learn about unforeseen events that
have put entire data centers out of commission for hours and even days. They include battery-
room explosions to data-center overloads and even server confiscation by law enforcement. The
lesson from these experiences is not to plan IT service recovery for predictable catastrophic
events but rather to plan recoveryfor data-center outages no matter what the cause. Participants
will learn innovative techniques for maintaining IT services regardless of the situation, with
active/activesystemsasanexample.
3870-Doesdatareplicationeliminatebackups?
Dr.BillHighleyman,AvailabilityDigest
Data replication maintains an independent, up-to-date copy of a primary database on a remote
standby system. So is a backup copy also necessary? Yes! Data replication protects system

operations, not data. Replication provides rapid recovery to a standby system with a current
application database that has been maintained in sync with the production database. However, if
the production database gets corrupted, or if a file or table is lost, data replication provides no
protection. The same is true if there is a simultaneous failure of both the production and standby
databases. Therefore, the database must be backed up. Attendees will learn about many real-
world storage failures. Some took down data centers for days and others were near misses.This
session concludes with an overview of HP data replication, virtual-tape backup, and magnetic-
tapebackupproducts.
4500-Advancesinhigh-andcontinuous-availabilityarchitecturesforNonStopsystems
JohnHoffmannandPaulHolenstein,Gravic
As businesses’ needs have led to higher application availability requirements, architectures are
evolving to meet those needs. This session will describe the recovery time and recovery point
objectives model that businesses use to quantify their needs, discuss the factors (and trade-offs)
that affect each objective, and present replication architectures to attain these stringent goals. It
will also describe the technological advances in the development pipeline to show how the
technologyis moving toward continuous application availability with zero data loss in the event of
a disaster. This session will define what is meant by high and continuous application availability,
then focus on asynchronous and synchronous replication technologies that support disaster
recovery (active/passive) architectures as well as the more sophisticated bi-directional
active/active architectures. The session will include several case studies, highlighting the
advantagesandlimitationsofeachimplementation.

networking uses network virtualization to create a high-performance, highly available network
architecture that is easier to manage and lowers the total cost of ownership. In addition, it
eliminates legacy technologies to create the ideal architecture model for all mission-critical data
centers.
3834-Theimpactofcloudservicesondisasterrecovery:opportunitiesandchallenges
JulienFurioli,PriceWaterhouseCoopers
This session is for IT professionals responsible for managing technology infrastructure and for
planning, testing and implementing a disaster recovery plan, such as CTOs/CIOs, disaster
recovery managers, application owners/architects, infrastructure owners, and distributed
computingowners.
3744-ReplicationisnotDR:enablingautomateddisasterrecoveryforHPenvironments
BobbyCrouch,FalconStorSoftware
Remote replication is often considered a disaster recovery (DR) solution. However, replication is
simply the transport of data, which you must still functionally arrange. Resuming business
operations after a disaster involves the complex tasks of building servers, installing systems and
applications, assigning storage volumes, and ensuring items start in the correct order. True
disaster recovery is a complex task. At this session, attendees will learn the difference between
DR and remote replication. They will also learn how to easily implement automated DR

3818-Disasterrecovery:howvirtualizationchangesthegame
MattJacoby,HP
As organizations increase their investment in virtualization technologies, and consolidate their
data centers to take advantage of storage, server and infrastructure flexibility, it is important for
administrators and architects alike to recognize that disaster recovery strategies have also
evolved within the virtualized space. In this session, we explore various disaster recovery
methods used to protect virtualized environments thus ensuring the most optimum Restore Time

2680-Survivingtheenterprisedatadisaster
JimGursha,RiskMasters
Although IT environments maybecapable of survivingdisastrous events, willcritical datasurvive
without transaction loss? Will the disaster cause business losses? Increases in information and
more stringent data protection laws require extraordinary methods to protect the information and
guarantee enterprise-wide data integrity. The session will cover solutions and sample
configuration architectures to help with on-going data protection efforts: for example, tape
backup/restore vs. virtual tape and replication. A discussion will trace the life of a data I/O from
the application level through the server hardware, out through the fiber network to the Storage
AreaNetwork andthetargetdisk.Attendees willlearnthedetailsinvolvedinsafe-guardingcritical

3750-Usingvirtualizationforhighavailability&disasterrecoverylab
JeffKight,HP
Hands-OnLab
Today, companies are interested in incorporating high availability and disaster recoverysolutions
into their infrastructures. This lab will give you hands-on experience in building a data center in a
box with single-site high availability and multi-site data recovery. Products used for
implementation will include VMware vSphere 4.1, VMware Site Recovery Manager and HP
StorageworksP4000VirtualSANApplianceforESX.
4255-Usingthecloudforcost-effectivedisasterrecoveryandbusinessresiliency
MichaelDelvecchioandGeorgeFerguson,HP
Many companies look at cloud computing as a means to provide faster, more cost-effective
disaster recovery. Discerning companies realize that the same cloud infrastructure can also
improve business resiliency and availability-critical for today's Instant-On Enterprises. In this
session, you will learn which cloud services and solutions are available and how to use them in
yourenterprise.
3999-Bestpracticesfortuningandimprovingyourdatacenteroperations
DixieHedges,HP
Meeting business needs can be challenging. You may need to deliver services faster while
maintaining operations efficiency. Or you may have to improve your infrastructure while reducing
costs. Maybe you have to do it all at once-stretching your resources to the limit. However, you
don't have to face your data center challenges alone. An HP Account Support Manager, whose
job it is to work with mission critical environments, will facilitate this session. You will learn key
tips and best practices to streamline project and transitional fulfillment, enhance operational
continuityanddrivecontinualimprovementacrossthedatacenter.

3842-Eliminatingdefects:reducinghumanerrorinthedatacenter
RichardSawyer,HP
This session will explore proven methods for reducing human error in data center operations.
Human error accounts for approximately 80 percent of data center downtime. Errors in facility
infrastructure operations are the most costly, often producing catastrophic failures. This session
will review different approaches for reducing human errors in the data center, including protocols
used by the U.S. Navy, as well as virtual reality technology. This session will feature a
demonstration of how virtual reality technology can be used simulate and test operational
practices and responses. This session is ideal for facility infrastructure (FI) managers and IT
operationalmanagerswithFIresponsibilities.

The shift from physical to virtual continues to alter the IT and threat landscape. As IT
organizationsundertakenewandinnovativewaystodeliverelastic,dynamic,andhighlyavailable
