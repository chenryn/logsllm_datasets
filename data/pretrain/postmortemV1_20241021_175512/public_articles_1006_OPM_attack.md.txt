A Massive Hack on the U.S. Government
June2015
Starting in mid-2014, a sophisticated cyberattack began siphoning sensitive personal
information from the computers of the U.S. Government’s Office of Personnel
Management computers. By the time the attack was discovered one year later, analysts estimated that
the personal information of an estimated 4 million current and former federal employees had been
compromised.
Though ardently denied by China, all technical fingerprints of the attack point to attackers in the People’s
RepublicofChina.
The Office of Personnel Management
The U.S. Government’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is tasked with conducting background
investigations on all federal employees. It provides these checks not only for the Department of Defense
butalsoforoveronehundredotherfederalagencies.Thedataobtainedfromthesebackgroundchecksis

A recent security audit of OPM’s systems determined that 11 out of 47 systems were not certified as
beingsecure.Noneof theseinsecuresystems areoperatedbyOPM’s contractors –theyarealloperated
by OPM’s own IT department. 65% of OPM’s data is stored on these insecure systems. Some are over
twenty years old and are written in COBOL. They are not easily upgraded to include encryption or multi-
factorauthentication.Replacingthemwouldrequireacompleterewrite,adauntingandexpensivetask.
To makematters worse, Congress recently cut OPM’s budget. OPM was forced to outsource much of its
background checking efforts to external contractors. The first contractor was USIS (U.S. Information
Services). The USIS computers were hacked shortly after it received the OPM contract.When USIS was
caught submitting 665,000 incomplete background checks that the company claimed were complete in

OPM selected another small contractor, KeyPoint Government Solutions of Colorado, to replace USIS.

The Attack
The OPM systems were breached about a year ago, in June or July 2014. The attack went unnoticed for
almost a year, until June 2015. It then was discovered only because OPM was upgrading its security.
OPM was centralizing security oversight under its CIO and had been implementing numerous tools and
capabilities to monitor for security breaches.When it discovered the breach, OPM loaded the information
into “Einstein,” a government-wide intrusion detection system run by the Department of Homeland
Security(DHS)toprotectotheragenciesfromsimilarintrusions.

The attackers entered the system via the use of valid user credentials with administrative privileges,
presumably obtained via social engineering. They had set up a website, OPM-learning.org, that used
malicious software electronically signed as safe with a certificate stolen from DTOPTOOLZ, a Korean
software company. The malicious software imbedded a rare tool called Sakula to take control of the
computers.ThisisbelievedtobethesametoolusedintheAnthemhealthcarehack.1
Based on the analysis of the Anthem breach and other pointers found in the OPM hack, investigators
believe that the OPM attack was executed by Chinese hackers. China’s offensive cyber capabilities have
consistentlysurprised the U.S. in terms of the breadth and sophistication of the attacks. Chinese hackers

However,thoughmostChineseattacksseem tooriginatefrom themilitary,theOPMattack appearstobe
the work of a different set of hackers. Rather than trying to discover military or industrial secrets, this

China said that allegations about breaking into US government computers are irresponsible. Beijing
routinely dismisses any allegation of its official involvement in cyberattacks on foreign targets, noting that
China is itself the target of hacking attacks. It calls for greater international cooperation to combat
hacking.
TheChineseforeignministerissuedastatementproclaimingthat
“Chinese law prohibits attacks and other such behaviors which damage Internet security. The
Chinese government takes resolute strong measures against any kind of hacking attack.We oppose
baselessinsinuationsagainstChina.”
The Obama administration has refrained from making any official statement about China’s role in the
attack on the Office of Personnel Management since it feels that it is difficult to trace a data breach back
toitsoriginalsource.
The Stolen Data
Current estimates are that personal data was stolen from 4.2 million past and current federal employees,
though the government’s workers’ union insists that the number is more like 14 million. In any event, the
private data of millions of former and existing U.S. government employees is likely now in the hands of
theChinesestate.
A good bit of this information comes from the 120-page SF86 form filled out by people applying for
security clearances. It therefore includes security and clearance information for intelligence and military
personnel as well as civilian personnel. This data is stored in OPM’s virtuallyunencrypted databases and
includes sensitive information on virtually every aspect of people’s personal history, including financial
records, outstanding debt, gambling addictions, drug use, alcoholism, arrests, psychological and
emotionalhealth,foreigntravel,foreigncontacts,andanextensivelistofallrelatives.
The data also includes the results of polygraph tests that are used to uncover any blackmailable
information about government employees before it can be used against them. Therefore, this information
is a goldmine of blackmail for intruders. Experts fear the stolen information could be used bythe Chinese
government for blackmail, exploitation, or recruitment of U.S. intelligence officers, compromising the
