Crimea Loses Power for Two Weeks
December2015
Mostof the citizens of Crimea were withoutpower from November 21throughDecember
8, 2015. No, it wasn’t a cyberattack. It was sabotage in response to Russia’s 2014
annexation of Crimea, which had been part of Ukraine. Ukrainian activists blew up the four Ukrainian
power feeds that provide most of the electrical energy for Crimea, and the saboteurs then continued to
preventrepairteamsfromrestoringpower.
Crimea
IsthmusofPerekop StraitofKerch
Crimea is a major land mass on the northern coast of the
Black Sea.It lies south of Ukraineand west of Russia and
is very close to both countries. Crimea is connected on its
north side to Ukraine bythe Isthmus of Perekop, a narrow
strip of land. Crimea is only thirteen kilometers from its
eastsidetoRussiaacrosstheStraitofKerch.
Russian Annexation of Crimea
After World War II, Ukraine became part of the Soviet
Union.Followingthecollapseof theSovietUnion,Ukraine
became an independent nation in 1991. Crimea, which is
barely connected to Ukraine by land, became part of
Ukrainefollowingapublicreferendum.
TheUkrainianPeninsula
In March 2014, Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, reclaimed Crimea as part of Russia. He described the
annexation as the correction of a historic injustice and brushed aside international condemnation. In a
showof democracy,RussiaallowedCrimeatovote in areferendum onwhether theywantedtobepartof

Crimea Loses Power
Crimea gets about 70% of its electricity from Ukraine. It generates the rest of its energy from gas and
coal-fired generating plants within Crimea. Ukrainian electric power is sent to Crimea over four power
linesthatcomeintoCrimeaovertheIsthmusofPerekop.

On Friday, November 20, 2015, two of the electric
power feeds from Ukraine to Crimea near the
Crimeanborder weretakendownbyblowingupthe
pylons that carried the power lines. Two days later,
the other two power feeds were similarly blown up.
This denied Crimea two-thirds of its electric power
and forced it to ration electricity. Power was
resumed to hospitals and other vital services via
backup generators. However, 1.6 million people
were without power. Fortunately, the weather had
not yet turned to a wintry cold. Daytime
temperatures hovered around 60 degrees
Fahrenheit.
The saboteurs have not been found, and their
identities are unknown. However, Crimean authorities suspect that they were Ukrainian nationals and
Tatars.TheCrimeanTatars,whoopposeRussianrule,areanethnicgroupnativetothepeninsula.
Ukraine’s electricity-generating plants use gas and coal. Presumably, in response to this act of terrorism,
the Russian gas giant, Gazprom, announced that it was cutting off all gas supplies to Ukraine because it
had not paid its bills. Russia also threatened to cut off coal supplies. Fortunately, Ukraine had beefed up
its gas-storage facilities and had arranged for additional gas supplies from Europe. Ukrainian authorities
statedthattheyhad29daysofgasreserves.
Activists Prevent Repair Teams from Restoring Power
The Ukrainian government immediately sent repair teams to restore power. However, they found armed
groups of Crimean Tatars protesting Russia’s annexation of Crimea and patrolling the sites of the broken
pylons.Thedemonstratorsguardedthepylonsandrefusedtolettherepairteamsnearthem.

However, Russia managed to get one of the undersea power cables operational in early December. On
December 8th, the Russian Energy Ministry announced that power had been fully restored to Crimea,

cable will be operational by the 20th of December.This will provide enough electrical power to cover 80%
to90%ofCrimea’sneeds.
Additional undersea power cables that will double the electrical capacity to Crimea will be completed in
thesummerof2016.

Russia intends to build two gas-powered stations in Crimea. They will burn gas piped from mainland
Russia,butthesefacilitiesarestillintheplanningstage.
Summary
To its credit and despite international condemnation of its annexation of Crimea, the Russians
immediatelyplannedtobreakCrimea’sdependenceupontheUkraine.
We talk about building disaster recovery systems in our Availability Digest articles. These systems can
continue the processing of critical applications should the production system fail. Russia took this a step
further. As soon as it annexed Crimea (and perhaps even earlier), it began the construction of a disaster
recovery system to protect a complete country from the failure of its power system. Russia’s plans to
make Crimea independent of Ukrainian power were almost completed when power from Ukraine was cut
by the saboteurs. Russia was able to complete its undersea power feeds quickly so that it could provide
Crimeawiththepoweritneeded.

hadn’t been so prepared with a good disaster recovery plan, the Crimean power outage could have been
