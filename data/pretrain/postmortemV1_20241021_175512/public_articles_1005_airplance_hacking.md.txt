Can An Airliner Be Hacked?

The Airline Hacking Achievements of Chris Roberts
Chris Roberts is thefounder ofOneWorldLabs,asecurityintelligencefirm that
identifies risks before they are exploited. About six years ago he became
interestedintheissueofairlinehackingviatheIFEsystem.
With a research colleague, he obtained publicly available flight manuals and
wiring diagrams for various commercial passenger jets. The diagrams showed
how, on some planes, the IFE systems were connected to the passenger
satellite phone network and were in turn connected to the planes’ cabin control
systemsandtheplanes’avionicssystems.
Roberts builtatest labtoexplore whathecoulddo withanairliner’s networks andfoundsuccessfulways
to hack into the avionics systems from the IFE systems. He spoke to several airplane manufacturers with
little success, and gave a presentation on his findings at the BSides security conference in Las Vegas.
Basedonhiswork,RobertshasbeenissuingwarningsaboutvulnerabilitiesinIFEsystemsforsixyears.
Last February, the FBI requested a meeting with him.Themeeting was followed up by another in March.
Roberts said he had identified vulnerabilities with IFE systems on Boeing 737-800, 737-900, 757-200,
and Airbus-320 aircraft. Roberts disclosed that he had sniffed data traffic over the avionics networks on

Electronics Box (SEB) located underneath each row of seats. He was able to pry the cover of the SEB

He claimed that he had compromised systems about fifteen to
twenty times from 2011 through 2014 and was able to sniff
cockpit data. In a previous tweet, he had posted pictures
containing details of aircraft data. He was furnishing this
information because he would like to see the vulnerabilities
fixed.
However,heclaimedtotheFBIthathehadhackedtheavionics

OneJokeToo Many
OnaUnitedAirlines flightfrom Denver toChicagoon April15,2015,frustrated after years of tryingto get
Boeing and Airbus to heed his warnings about security issues with their passenger communications
systems,Roberts gotintotrouble whenhejokinglytweetedthathecoulddeploythecabin’s oxygenmask
system:
“Find myself on a 737/800, let’s see Box-IFE-ICE-SATCOM? Shall we start playing with EICAS
messages?“PASSOXYGENON”anyone?”
(ICE is Inflight Communications Equipment, SATCOM is Satellite Communications, EICAS is Engine
IndicationCrewAlertingSystem).
Roberts was on his way to speak at a major security conference about vulnerabilities in modern
transportationsystems.InChicago,heboardedaconnectingflighttoSyracuse,NewYork.
However, an employee with United’s Cyber Security Intelligence Department became aware of the tweet
and contacted the FBI. He told them that Roberts was on a connecting flight to Syracuse. At Syracuse,
Roberts was escorted off the plane by two FBI agents and two police officers. His computer and iPad

TheFBITakesAction

Roberts referenced research he had done years ago on vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to
access cabin controls and deploy a plane’s oxygen masks. During the interception interview, Roberts
showedFBIwiringschematicsofmultipleairplanemodelsthatwerepubliclyavailable
Contrary to Robert’s earlier statements, the search warrant issued by the FBI for the confiscation of his
computers claims that his computers contain evidence that Roberts had commandeered the network of
an inflight airplane using default user names and passwords. Having gained access to the network, the
FBI claims that Roberts had overwritten code on the airplane’s Thrust Management Computer to
successfully issue a climb command. This caused one engine to increase power and thrust the airliner
into a lateral movement. Roberts denies this, claiming that the FBI took this information out of context.
(Note: This allegation has not been proven in a court of law. Roberts has yet to be charged with any
crime.)
Followingtheinterview,Robertstweeted:

The Government Weighs In
Following the FBI interview with Roberts, the TSA and FBI issued a bulletin to airlines to be on the
lookoutforpassengersshowingsignstheymaybetryingtohack intoanairplane’sWi-FiorIFEsystem.It
warnedofsecuritythreatsfacingmodernaircraftthatmightallowahackertotakecontroloftheairplane.
According to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report, which interestingly was issued the day
beforeRoberts’jokingtweet:
“Modern aircraft are increasingly connected to the Internet. This interconnectedness can potentially
provide unauthorized remote access to aircraft avionics systems. As part of the aircraft certification
process, FAA's Office of Safety currently certifies new interconnected systems through rules for
specific aircraft and has started reviewing rules for certifying the cybersecurity of all new aircraft
systems.”
A Boeing spokeswoman said that her company did indeed design a solution to address the FAA
concerns. She wouldn’t go into detail about how Boeing was tackling the problem but said Boeing was
employing a combination of solutions that involved some physical air-gapping of the networks as well as
software firewalls. “There are places where the networks are not touching, and there are places where
theyare,”shesaid.
Opinions of Other Experts
According to other security experts, the situation is muddled. There have been cases where networks
have not been properly segmented, leaving open vulnerabilities. Other law enforcement sources have
saidthereisnoevidenceahackercouldgaincontrolofanairliner’savionicsnetwork.
According to Bruce Schneier, a computer security specialist, Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 and A380
airliners have a single network that is used both by pilots to fly the plane and passengers for their Wi-Fi
connections. The avionics and passenger systems are connected thorough a firewall that blocks

Bug Bounty Programs
Many companies have now initiated “bug bounty programs” in which they will pay hackers who report
securitybugs tothem.Barracudaoffers $50to$3,133 for adisclosure.Cashbountyprograms havebeen
implemented by Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. Google will pay $500 to $50,000 depending upon the
severity of the vulnerability. Facebook has paid out over $3 million in rewards since 2011. Adobe has a
bug bounty program, but doesn’t pay cash. Instead, it rewards points that enhance the submitters’
HackerOnereputationscore.
Bug bounty programs have become so common that a website has sprung up to support them. Dubbed
Bugcrowd, the website provides bug bounty and penetration services. It currently has 220 active
bounties, 33,150 security vulnerability submissions, and 14,300 researchers participating in its
crowdsourcedsecurityprogram.
Someresearchers feelthat bug bountyprograms onlyserveto encourage hackers.Supporters claim that
