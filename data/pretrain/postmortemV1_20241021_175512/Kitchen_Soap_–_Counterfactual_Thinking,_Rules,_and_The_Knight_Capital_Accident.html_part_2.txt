    an emergency landing. While they argued, the plan crashed. (Dekker,
    2003)

Anyone operating in high-tempo and high-consequence environments
recognize both the utility and also the brittleness of a procedure, no
matter how much thought went into it.

Let's keep this idea in mind as we walk through the SEC release below.

 

## Violation of Rules != Explanation

 

Now let's talk about rules. The SEC's job (in a nutshell) is to design,
maintain, and enforce regulations of practice for various types of
financially-driven organizations in the United States. Note that they
are **not** charged with explaining or preventing events. Preventing may
or may not result from their work in regulations, but prevention demands
much more than abiding by rules.

Rules and regulations are similar to procedures in that they are written
with deliberate but ultimately interpretable intention. Judges and
juries help interpret different contexts as they relate to a given rule,
law, or regulation. Rules are good for a number of reasons that are
beyond the scope of this (now lengthy) post.

If we think about regulations in the context of *causality*, however, we
can get into trouble.

Because we can find ourselves in uncertain contexts that have some of
the dynamics that I listed above (multiple conflicting goals and targets
of attention) regulations (even when we are acutely aware of them) pose
some issues. In the Man-Made Disasters Model, Nick Pidgeon lays some of
this out for us:

> <div>
>
> *"Uncertainty may also arise about how to deal with formal violations
> of safety regulations. Violations might occur because regulations are
> ambiguous, in conflict with other goals such as the needs of
> production, or thought to be outdated because of technological
> advance. Alternatively safety waivers may be in operation, allowing
> relaxation of regulations under certain circumstances (as also
> occurred in the \`Challenger' case; see Vaughan, 1996)." (Pidgeon,
> 2000)\
> *
>
> </div>

Rules and regulations need to allow for interpretation, otherwise they
would be brittle in enforcement. So therefore, vagueness and flexibility
in rules is desired. We'll see how this vagueness can be exploited for
enforcement, however, at the expense of learning.

## **Back to the statement**

Once more: the SEC document cannot be viewed as a canonical description
of what happened with Knight Capital on August 1, 2012.

It can, however, be viewed as a comprehensive account of the exchange
and trading regulations the SEC deems were violated by the organization.
This is its purpose. My goal here is not to critique the SEC release for
its purpose, it is to reveal how it cannot be seen to aid either
explanation or prevention of the event, and so should not be used for
that.

Before we walk through (at least parts) of the document, it's worth
noting that there is no objective accident investigative body that
exists for electronic trading systems. In aviation, there is a
regulative body (the FAA) and an investigative body (the NTSB) and there
is significant differences between the two, charter-wise and
operations-wise. There exists no such independent investigative body
analogous to the NTSB in Knight Capital's industry. There is only the
SEC.

## The Release

I'll have comments in italics, in [blue] and
[talk about the ]highlighted pieces. After
getting feedback from many colleagues, I decided to keep the length here
for people to dig into, because I think it's important to understand. If
you make it through this, you deserve cake.

[If you want to skip the annotated and butchered SEC statement, you can
just go to the

INTRODUCTION

1\. On August 1, 2012, Knight Capital Americas LLC ("Knight")
experienced a significant error in the operation of its automated
routing system for equity orders, known as SMARS. While processing 212
small retail orders that Knight had received from its customers, SMARS
routed millions of orders into the market over a 45-minute period, and
obtained over 4 million executions in 154 stocks for more than 397
million shares. By the time that Knight stopped sending the orders,
Knight had assumed a net long position in 80 stocks of approximately
\$3.5 billion and a net short position in 74 stocks of approximately
\$3.15 billion. Ultimately, Knight lost over \$460 million from these
unwanted positions. [The subject of these proceedings is Knight's
violation of a Commission rule]{style="background-color: #ffff00;"} that
requires brokers or dealers to have controls and procedures in place
reasonably designed to limit the risks associated with their access to
the markets, including the risks associated with automated systems and
the possibility of these types of errors.

2\. Automated trading is an increasingly important component of the
national market system. Automated trading typically occurs through or by
brokers or dealers that have direct access to the national securities
exchanges and other trading centers. Retail and institutional investors
alike rely on these brokers, and their technology and systems, to access
the markets.

3\. Although automated technology brings benefits to investors,
including increased execution speed and some decreased costs, automated
trading also amplifies certain risks. As market participants
increasingly rely on computers to make order routing and execution
decisions, [it is essential that compliance and risk management
functions at brokers or dealers keep
pace]{style="background-color: #ffff00;"}. In the absence of appropriate
controls, the speed with which automated trading systems enter orders
into the marketplace can turn an otherwise manageable error into an
extreme event with potentially wide-spread impact.

> difficult for me to argue with. This may be the most valuable
> statement in the document with regards to safety and the use of
> automation.*]

4\. [Prudent]{style="background-color: #ffff00;"} technology risk
management has, at its core, quality assurance, continuous improvement,
controlled testing and user acceptance, process measuring, management
and control, regular and rigorous review for compliance with applicable
rules and regulations and a strong and independent audit process. To
ensure these basic features are present and incorporated into day-to-day
operations, brokers or dealers must invest [appropriate
resources]{style="background-color: #ffff00;"} in their technology,
compliance, and supervisory infrastructures. Recent events and
Commission enforcement actions have demonstrated that this investment
must be supported by an [equally
strong]{style="background-color: #ffff00;"} commitment to prioritize
technology governance with a view toward preventing, [wherever
possible]{style="background-color: #ffff00;"}, software malfunctions,
system errors and failures, outages or other contingencies and, when
such issues arise, ensuring a [prompt, effective, and risk-mitigating
response]{style="background-color: #ffff00;"}. The failure by, or
unwillingness of, a firm to do so can have potentially catastrophic
consequences for the firm, its customers, their counterparties,
investors and the marketplace.

5\. The Commission adopted Exchange Act Rule 15c3-52 in November 2010 to
require that brokers or dealers, as gatekeepers to the financial
markets, "[appropriately]{style="background-color: #ffff00;"} control
the risks associated with market access, so as not to jeopardize their
own financial condition, that of other market participants, the
integrity of trading on the securities markets, and the stability of the
financial system."

> [*Note: It's true, this is what the rule says. What is deemed 
> "appropriate", it would seem, is dependent on the outcome. Had an
> accident? It was not appropriate control. Didn't have an accident? It
> must be appropriate control. This would mean that Knight Capital did
> have appropriate controls the day **before** the accident. Outcome
> bias reigns supreme here.*]

6\. Subsection (b) of Rule 15c3-5 requires brokers or dealers with
market access to "establish, document, and maintain a system of risk
management controls and supervisory procedures reasonably designed to
manage the financial, regulatory, and other risks" of having market
access. The rule addresses a range of market access arrangements,
including customers directing their own trading while using a broker's
market participant identifications, brokers trading for their customers
as agents, and a broker-dealer's trading activities that place its own
capital at risk. Subsection (b) also requires a broker or dealer to
preserve a copy of its supervisory procedures and a written description
of its risk management controls as part of its books and records.

> [*Note: The rules says, basically:  "have a document about controls
> and risks". It doesn't say anything about an organization's ability to
> adapt them as time and technology progresses, only that at some point
> they were written down and shared with the right
> parties. *]

7\. Subsection (c) of Rule 15c3-5 identifies specific required elements
of a broker or dealer's risk management controls and supervisory
procedures. A broker or dealer must have systematic financial risk
management controls and supervisory procedures that are [reasonably
designed]{style="background-color: #ffff00;"} to prevent the entry of
erroneous orders and orders that exceed pre-set credit and capital
thresholds in the aggregate for each customer and the broker or dealer.
In addition, a broker or dealer must have regulatory risk management
controls and supervisory procedures that are [reasonably
designed]{style="background-color: #ffff00;"} to ensure compliance with
all regulatory requirements.
