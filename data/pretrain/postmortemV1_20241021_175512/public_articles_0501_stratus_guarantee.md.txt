Stratus Bets $50,000 That You Won’t Be Down
January2010
Stratus Technologies (www.stratus.com) has been providing fault-tolerant
servers for the last three decades. It claims that its current fault-tolerant
servers provide in excess of six 9s availability (up 99.9999% of the time,
corresponding to 32 seconds of downtime per year). It backs up this claim
withtheStratusUptimeMeterfoundonitshomepage.Thismeterisupdated
daily and is based on all reported service incidents that impacted production during the past six
months.
The $50K Zero Downtime Guarantee

Downtime $50K Guarantee.1 If you buy a Stratus ftServer®
6300 running Microsoft Windows Server 2008 before February
26, 2010, and if it fails in production during the first six months
of deployment, Stratus will pay you $50,000. In many cases,

The Stratus ftServer
Stratus’ ftServer was described in some detail in the September, 2007, Availability Digest article
entitled“Fault-TolerantWindowsandLinuxfromStratus.”2Webrieflyreviewithere.
ftServers provide plug-and-play fault tolerance for Windows
and Red Hat Linux applications. Using Intel Xeon chips in a
dual modular redundancy architecture, ftServers bring
extremely high availability to the industry standard
marketplace at affordable prices. The ftServer supports
VMware for virtualization and VMware’s vSphere for internal
cloud computing. ftServer’s applicability ranges from use by
small businesses with critical applications to large data

In addition to fault-tolerant processors, Stratus also offers the ftScalable array for fault-tolerant
storage.TheseareRAIDarraysthatcanbescaledto10.8terabytesofstorage.
TheProcessors
The high availability achieved by the Stratus ftServer product line is achieved by running all
applications on x86 dual processors that are lockstepped at the memory access level. Should
there be a disagreement between the processors, one of the processors has probablysuffered a
fault. If the faulty processor has detected its own fault, that processor is taken out of service.
Otherwise,processingis pausedas eachprocessor enters aself-testmode;andtheprocessor in
error is taken out of service. Processing continues with the remaining good processor. If both
processors report that they are operating properly, the error is probably a transient error. One

The faulty processor can be replaced and synchronized with the operational processor while the
systemcontinuestorun.

TheOperatingSystem
Stratus supports Windows and Red Hat Linux operating systems that are commercially available
to anyone. Therefore, the ftServers are application binary interface (ABI) compatible with
Windows and Linux applications. Any application that can run under Windows or Red Hat Linux
onanindustry-standardservercanrunonanftServerwithoutmodification.
Behind the scenes, Stratus spends a great deal of effort ensuring that these operating systems
measureuptoitshigh-availabilityrequirements.Workingwithitspartners,MicrosoftandRedHat,
Stratus works diligently to harden the operating systems so that operating system faults are
minimized.
Stratus engineers have found that the weak links in the software systems are the device drivers.
Therefore, Stratus develops its own hardened device drivers that will stand up to the stresses of
productionenvironments;anditincorporatestheminitsstandardconfigurations.
StratusCallHome
All Stratus servers monitor themselves for faults. If a problem of anykind is detected, the system
will automatically call a Stratus support facility (provided customer permission has been granted
todoso);andactionisimmediatelytakentodiagnosetheproblem.
If it is decided that a component needs to be replaced, Stratus will immediately send the
component to the customer’s site. There are many cases in which the first sign of a problem to
thecustomeriswhenhereceivesthereplacementpartinthemail.
DisasterTolerance
The ftServer is a single system that will tolerate any single fault. To provide disaster tolerance in
the event of a data-center disaster, a remote backup system can be kept synchronized with the

Protecting the Edge
Stratus has recently announced a new system, Avance, that is tailored for what they refer to as
“edge computing” – everything outside of the corporate data center.4 Avance runs on a pair of
standard x86 servers connected by an Ethernet link. The servers may be up to 0.5 kilometers
apart. The servers run as a primary/backup pair, and Avance creates a single-system image for
theoperatorsandusers.

The Ethernet connection is used for two purposes. One is to exchange health information

viasynchronousreplication.
Using the open source Xen hypervisor, Avance supports both Windows and Linux virtual
machines. The backup server seamlessly takes over the functions of a failed virtual machine or
the primary processor should it fail. In the worst case, a catastrophic server crash will be

Summary
Theimpactonsystem availabilityofvendor-suppliedhardwareandsoftwareisrapidlydiminishing
to the point that it is no longer a significant factor. Systems such as Stratus’ ft Server, HP
NonStop systems, IBM’s Parallel Sysplex, and HP’s OpenVMS clusters that exhibit availabilities
greater than six nines effectively take these systems out of the availability equation. Rather,
availability Is determined today by application bugs, operator errors, and environmental faults
suchaspower,cooling,anddata-centerdestruction.
Six nines of availabilitycan be extended beyond the data center byactive/active systems,5 which
provide distributed processing by geographically-separated nodes synchronized via data
replication.Anodefailureisrecoveredbysimplyreroutinguserstosurvivingnodes.
Continuous availabilityis no longer a technological problem. It is an exercise in balancing system
cost with downtime cost. Stratus’ ftServer is an affordable starting point to achieve extreme
availabilities.Stratussaysso–withitswallet.
