Bank-Verlag
Bank-Verlag has been featured as a case study in the Availability Digest.1 Bank-Verlag was
perhaps the first company ever to use NonStop servers in an active/active configuration.2 In
1986, Bank-Verlag was tasked by a group of German banks to create a system to manage the
new technology of debit cards that was just being offered to the German public. It built a debit-
cardauthorizationsystemusinganIBM370donatedtoitbyoneofthebanks.
Shortly after the inauguration of the new debit-card system, the use of debit cards became very
popular in Germany. Bank-Verlag recognized a need for greater availability and set out to
investigate other platforms. It was impressed by the fact that Tandem bragged about two 9s to
the right of the decimal point whereas other systems bragged about two 9s to the left of the

decimal point. Tandem was chosen, and an existing debit-card package that ran on the NonStop
systemwasacquiredandmodifiedforBank-Verlag’suse.
ThislefttheproblemofmigratingfromtheIBM370totheTandemVLXwithoutdenyingserviceto
debit-card users. To solve this problem, Bank-Verlag were configured what would come to be
known as an active/active configuration between the IBM system and the Tandem system. The
firststep was tomodifyboththeIBM andTandem applications tosend processed transactions to
the other system. The IBM database was copied to the Tandem, and a few ATMs were
connectedtotheTandem.
At this point, both systems were processing transactions and sending their transactions to the
other system for processing to keep the databases in synchronism. In just a few days, Bank-
Verlag had migrated all of the ATMs to the Tandem system; and transaction replication was kept
inplacetokeeptheIBMsystemasahot-standby.
In 1989, with the continued explosive growth in
the use of debit cards, the capacity of the
authorization system had to be expanded.
Because of the increasing importance of debit transactions
cards to the German economy, Bank-Verlag

also wanted to achieve a degree of disaster 3km
tolerance. It therefore revisited its earlier
active/active success and purchased a second
Tandem system, installing it in a separate data
center three kilometers away (Germany is not
plagued by hurricanes and earthquakes). The
application was modified so that only the
updates created by a transaction were

replicated to the other system, thus improving
processing efficiency. The ATMs were Bank-VerlagToday
distributed between the two systems, and both
actively processed debit-card transactions. A Tandem (now HP NonStop) active/active system
wasthusbornin1989.
To our knowledge, the Bank-Verlag system has suffered only one outage in its 21 years of
operation due either to planned or unplanned downtime. Early on, an operator error took down
both systems. Operational procedures were quickly improved to prevent such occurrences in the
future.
VocaLink
TheVocaLink FasterPaymentsService(FPS)system hasalsobeenthesubjectofanAvailability
Digest case study.3 In May, 2008, when VocaLink inaugurated its Faster Payments Service, it
introduced the first new payments service in the U.K. in twenty years. For the first time, phone,
Internet,andstanding-orderpaymentsmovedinrealtimebetweencustomerbanks.
On a peak day, the VocaLink automated payment platform processes over 90 million

ATMs.ItsHPNonStopReal-TimePaymentsplatformprovidesthecentralinfrastructureforFPS.
VocaLink’s SLA is interesting. It calls for 100% availability (no 9s) from midnight to 6 AM when
standing orders are processed. Its overall availability must be greater than 99.75%. To achieve

this, VocaLink has implemented FPS using an active/active architecture, with HP NonStop
serversdistributedbetweentwodatacenters,oneinHarrogateandoneinLeeds.
In each data center, there are two eight-processor NonStop servers. One handles the ATM
network, and the other provides the FPS functions. This gives VocaLink a two-to-one expansion
capability by adding up to eight more processors to each system. The databases of the two data
centersarekeptinsynchronismviadatareplication.
Each user of the FPS system maintains connections to both data
centers. A user will round-robin its transactions between the two
data centers, sending one transaction to one data center and the
nexttransactiontotheotherdatacenter.Thisprocedureprovides
two benefits. First, a system fault is rapidly detected should a
response not be received in response to a transaction. In this
case, the user will simply route all transactions to the surviving
systemuntilthefailedsystemisrestored.
Furthermore, transfers between banks can all be accomplished
within one data center since all banks connect to both data
centers. When a bank executes a transaction with another bank,
it is assured that the recipient bank is connected to the data
center to which the transaction is routed. In the rare case of an
outgoing link failure to a bank, FPS will route the transaction to
theotherdatacenterforexecution.
From an availability viewpoint, the FPS system has had zero downtime due either to unplanned
outagesorplannedoutagesforupgradessinceitsinception.
Belgacom
Belgacom, headquartered in Brussels, is the largest telecommunications provider in Belgium.
Created in 1991, Belgacom is an outgrowth of the Belgium national telephone and telegraph
company(RTT)thatdatesbackto1930.
Belgacom has implementedits Customer OrientedBilling(COB) onaNonStopNS16000 with1.7
terabytesofdiskstorage.COBprovidesseveralfunctions,including:
 customerorderprocessing
 billing
 paymentsandrefunds
 complaints
 reminders
 usageprocessing
COBsupports3,200terminalsandprocessesapeakloadof2,200transactionspersecond.
The downtime cost to Belgacom for COB outages is estimated to be 70,000€ per day for a one-
day outage, escalating to over 1 million euros per day for a 30-day outage. The COB SLA
therefore calls for 24x7 operation with 100% availability except for two five-hour planned
maintenance outages per year for major application releases. The result is an overall availability
of99.88%,oralmostthree9s.
These outages are taken at night when activity is at a minimum. Though application upgrades
can be made online, the planned maintenance outages gives Belgacom the ability to make

The COB system is backed up with a disaster recovery site 35 kilometers away. The DR site is
kept synchronized with the production site via asynchronous replication using NonStop RDF
(Remote Database Facility). The backup site has already proven its value with a successful
failover.
The Criteria for Winning
TherearefourcriteriaforwinningtheNonStopAvailabilityAward:
 Thenumberofminutesthatthesystemhasbeendowninthereportingperiod.
 Thesystemconfigurationanditsoperationalcomplexity.
 Theuseofbestpracticesforoutageprevention.
 Thequalityofoutagedata.
Typical best practices reported by entrants have been summarized earlier in the Availability
Digest (see Availability Best Practices, Availability Digest; January 2007, which can be found at
http://www.availabilitydigest.com/private/0201/availability_best_practices.pdf.
The quality of outage data is very important. The selection team, headed by Wendy Bartlett of
HP, looks for application availability statistics both within the governing SLA and calculated on a
24x7 basis. If there have been no user-perceptible outages, scheduled or unscheduled, beyond
one-off failures of client devices such as ATMs or POS devices, this qualifies as 100%
availability.Otherwise,availabilityisreportedrelativetotheSLAandalsoona7x24basis.

Another Criterion?
BasedonmajorfailuresthatwehaveseenandhavereportedinourNeverAgain series,itseems
that there might be one more criterion for an availability award. That is customer communication
duringanoutage.
Whenasystem goesdown,theenduser has noideawhathashappened.Isithissystem?Isita
network problem? Is it a data center problem? Who should he call? How long will he be out of
service?
There have been too many cases in which an outage created such havoc in the data center that
thecallcenter was overwhelmedand didnotanswer calls or respond to emails. Status was often
planned to be posted to the company’s web site, but the web site was down. Frustrated
customers were left totally in the dark. This has happened to many major companies, such as
Amazon, PayPal, Salesforce.com, Hostway, and WestHost, as reported in the archives of the
AvailabilityDigest’sNeverAgainseries.
On the other hand, several companies managed to maintain good customer communications
during major outages, including Google, Rackspace, and The Planet. Several have implemented
independent digital dashboards showing in real time the status of all of their services. They
include Google’s Google Apps Dashboard, Amazon’s Service Health Dashboard, and
Salesforce.com’s trustsalesforce.com. Both Amazon and Salesforce.com implemented their
status dashboards inresponseto outraged demandbytheir users.Kudos goto thesecompanies
forcaringabouttheirusers.
Poor customer communication during outages is no longer hidden. When this happens, Twitter
tweets ensure that everyone knows. Should not high availability include customer support when
thesystemisunavailable?
Summary
TheNonStopcommunityisfocusedonhighavailability–thatiswhatHPNonStopsystemsareall
about. The NonStop Availability Award is a recognition of those companies that have carried this
technologytotheextreme–oftenzerodowntime-withavailabilitybestpractices.
