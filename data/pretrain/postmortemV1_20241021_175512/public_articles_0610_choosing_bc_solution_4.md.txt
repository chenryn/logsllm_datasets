Choosing a Business Continuity Solution
Part 4 – Choosing an Availability Architecture
October2011
In the first three parts of this series,1 we explored various data replication techniques and the
highlyavailable architectures that can be implemented with them. In this final part, we look at the
considerations that will lead you to the choice of the proper architecture to meet your business
needs.
The Replication Quadrant
In our discussion of highly- and continuouslyavailable systems,we have reviewed asynchronous
and synchronous replication in unidirectional and bidirectional configurations. This gives us four
distinct combinations to consider; and they are reflected in the Replication Quadrant, shown in
Figure 1. In this figure, we depict typical RPOs and RTOs (Figure 1a), typical configurations
(Figure 1b), and typical applications (Figure 1c) for the four combinations. Representative
characteristicsforsystemsimplementedwitheachofthesecombinationsareasfollows:
 A unidirectional asynchronous system has an RPO measured in seconds (the
replication latency of the data-replication channel). Its RTO is measured in minutes or
longer as applications are started following a failure of the active node, the databases
are mounted, and the network is reconfigured. Additional recovery time is typically
required for the management decision time to fail over to the backup system and for
testingtoensurethatthebackupisperformingproperly.
This replication method is used for classic disaster-recovery, active/passive
configurations.Itsupports applicationsthatmustbehighlyavailablebutforwhichsome
small data loss is tolerable.2 CRM (customer-relationship management) and HR
(human resources) corporate applications are examples of this class of application, as
are ATM transactions. ATM transactions have a low value; and if the ATM machine is
down, the customer can often go to a different ATM machine serviced by a different
bank.

RiskAssessment
In order to make effective use of the Replication Quadrant, a companymustknow the availability
requirements for each application. In an organization, some applications are typically mission-
critical or even safety-critical and may require continuous availability. Business-critical and task-
critical applications may require high availability. Some applications may be non-critical and can
bedownforhoursordayswithoutcausinganygreatproblem.
The critical ranking of applications maychange over time. A good example of this is email. A few
years ago, one could live without email for a few days. Today, however, email often forms the
communication backbone between a company and its employees and customers. Company
operations may grind to a halt if the email system is lost. In manycompanies, email has become

Cost/BenefitAnalysis
Knowing the costs of downtime and of data loss and the costs of protecting against these, one
can calculate the required RTO and RPO. For instance, a large brokerage firm finds that its
average trade is about $25,000. If the firm earns an average of 2% commission on each trade, a
trade is worth $500 in revenues to the firm. If it is doing 10 transactions per second, its cost of
downtime is $5,000 per second, or $300,000 per minute. Its order-processing system currently
runsonaUNIXcluster,whichthefirmestimateswillbedownaboutfiveminutesperyear.Itstotal
costofdowntimeistherefore$1,500,000per year.
The firm has determined that it will cost $1,350,000 to add enough hardware, software, and
networkingtoeliminateall singlepoints of failure.It wants to get areturn on its investmentinone
year. An RTO of 30 seconds for the new system will save 4.5 minutes of downtime per year,
yielding the required $1,350,000 savings. Furthermore, the brokerage firm cannot lose any
transactions withoutbeinginviolationof securityregulations.Therefore,itneeds anRPO of zero.
From the Replication Quadrant of Figure 1, it is clear that the firm should seriously consider an
active/activeconfigurationusingsynchronousreplication.
Inother cases,itis notthe monetarycostof downtimethatinfluences thechoice of anavailability
architecture but rather a required level of service. Consider the Home Location Registers (HLR)
that mobile telecommunication providers use to track mobile users and to place calls. An HLR
typically handles 10,000 customers. If an HLR should fail, none of the mobile users that it is
servicingcanmakeorreceivemobilecalls.
During a busy period, an HLR may be placing 1,000 calls per minute. If each call has a value of
$1.00, the cost associated with the downtime of an HLR is $1,000 per minute. If an HLR is down
for five minutes each year, the mobile provider will lose $5,000 per year due to the downtime of
an HLR. This most likely would not justify the cost of an active/active system. However, the

The Shadowbase Replication Suite
The Shadowbase Replication Suite from Gravic, Inc., (www.gravic.com) comprises a set of
products that support unidirectional and bidirectional data replication between homogeneous and
heterogeneous systems. Shadowbase currently supports asynchronous replication, and
synchronous replication is on the product roadmap.6 The range of availability architectures

 Shadowbase ZDL, a synchronous data-replication engine using coordinated
commits similar to Shadowbase Plus SR. In addition to eliminating data loss,
Shadowbase ZDL reduces application latency relative to Shadowbase Plus SR by
safe-storing rather than applying replicated data during the source transaction. This
may lead to data collisions in certain active/active configurations for some
applications.

The Shadowbase product suite covers the upper-right quadrant of the Business Continuity
Continuumdepictedinourpreviouspartinthisseries.
ShadowbaseAsynchronousReplicationEngine
The Shadowbase asynchronous replication engine uses process-to-process transactional
replication to move data from a source database to a target database. Since Shadowbase
introduces no disk-queuing points, replication is highly efficient; and replication latency is
minimized.
A unidirectional Shadowbase asynchronous replication engine is useful to maintain
synchronization of a backup database with its primary database. In this case, the backup system
is typically idle so far as update processing is concerned. However, it can be used for query
processing since Shadowbase provides for the target database to be a consistent copy of the
sourcedatabase,thoughdelayedbythereplicationlatency.
By extending this architecture to bidirectional data replication, both nodes can be actively
processing transactions since each has an up-to-date copy of the application. Shadowbase
accomplishes bidirectional replicationbyusingtworeplication engines,oneineachdirection,that
shareinformationaboutthedatabeingreplicatedtoavoidping-ponging.7
Asdescribedearlier,aseriousproblemencounteredwithbidirectionalasynchronousreplicationis
data collisions. The Shadowbase asynchronous data-replication engine supports collision-
avoidance methods. If collisions cannot be avoided, Shadowbase provides the mechanisms
necessary for detecting and resolving data collisions by embedding application logic into the
replicationengine.
Shadowbase replication engines have been used for several decades in many high-demand,
mission-criticalinstallations.
ShadowbasePlusSRSynchronousReplication
The upcoming Shadowbase Plus SR synchronous replication engine provides both
unidirectionalandbidirectionalsynchronousreplication.8
Shadowbase Plus SR is a future technology based on Gravic’s patented coordinated-commit
technology,9 which uses asynchronous replication of database transactions coupled with
synchronous commit. It extensively leverages the existing Shadowbase asynchronous
architecture to replicate data. In addition, it joins the transaction at the source system and votes
on the outcome of the transaction. If at commit time it has successfully applied all of the
transactionupdatestothetargetdatabase,itvotestocommit.Otherwise,itvotestoabort.
Shadowbase Plus SR continues the best-in-class features of Shadowbase, such as low latency,
highavailability,andcommunicationefficiency.
7 As described earlier, “ping-ponging” or data oscillation is the re-replication of replicated data back to the source
database.SeethesectioninthiswhitepaperentitledBidirectionalReplicationandActive/ActiveSystemsonpage

ShadowbaseZDL
Shadowbase ZDL is a future technology that is a modification of Shadowbase Plus SR. It also
joins the transaction at the source system and uses the Shadowbase asynchronous replication
engine to replicate data. However, rather than directly applying the changes to the target
database, it safe-stores them in a target-side persistent queue file and then applies them to the
targetdatabaseinthebackground.Atcommittime,ShadowbaseZDLwillvotetocommitifithas
successfully safe-stored all changes in its queue file, whether or not they have been applied to
thetargetdatabase.10
Consequently, application latency is reduced since it is much faster to queue changes than to
applythem tothe database.However,sincechanges areapplied asynchronously,applications at
thetargetsystemcanmodifythesamedataitemsbeforethereplicatedchangesareapplied,thus
leadingtodatacollisions.
Shadowbase ZDL can also be used with the Shadowbase asynchronous replication engine to
provide a safe-store on the target system to queue changes should the target database be taken
offline.
Summary
The technology exists today to achieve arbitrarily fast recovery times following a system failure
withlittleifanylossofdata.Thekeytothistechnologyisdatareplication.
Data replication comes in several forms – asynchronous or synchronous, unidirectional or
bidirectional. Each combination supports different ranges of recoverytimes (RTOs) and data loss
(RPOs).Byunderstandingthecostsofdowntimeanddatalossforeachapplicationandthecosts
of achieving various levels of high availability and continuous availability, IT management can
makeinformeddecisionsconcerningtheavailabilityapproachthatisrightforeachapplication.
The Shadowbase suite of replication products provides the full range of replication technologies
