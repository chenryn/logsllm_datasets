Bank of England Suffers Major Outage
April2015
On Monday, October 20, 2014, the Bank of England, the U.K.’s central bank established
in 1694, suffered a serious outage that affected the online transfer of funds for most of
the day and the closing on home purchases for over a day. This outage was a particularly embarrassing
incident for the bank, which only recently had warned U.K. banks that they were susceptible to failures
becauseoftheiruseoflegacysystemsdevelopedinthelastcentury.
The Bank of England Outage
After a weekend of scheduled maintenance, the Bank’s CHAPS (Clearing House Automated Payments
System) failed to come up on the following Monday. CHAPS provides real-time, online transfer of large
funds between banks and other financial institutions such as mortgage lenders. It is used by over 5,000
financialinstitutions.
TheBoE issued atersestatementsayingonlythat““TheBank of England has identifiedatechnical issue
related to some routine maintenance of the RTGS system.” The RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement)
system underpins the large-value CHAPS payments. The system remained unusable until late afternoon
thatMonday.
There were several problems that contributed to the outage. RTGS had a backup system, but IT
personnel decided not to try a failover because the backup system was relatively untested. They opted
insteadtotrytocorrecttheRTGSproblem,aneffortthattookmuchlongerthanexpected.
To compound the problem, several BoE top executives failed to get the initial email concerning the
outage because they were in Europe at a business meeting. It took over an hour to get the attention of a

While the CHAPS system was down, the BoE attempted to complete fund transfers manually, but fell
woefullybehind.Whenthe CHAPSsystem finallycameonline,theBoEextended its closinghours from 4
PM to 8 PM to complete online funds transfers. BoE personnel were able to complete all 143,000 funds
transfers for thedaytotalingnearly£300 billion.However,almostathird of transfers for housepurchases

The Deloitte Report
BoE faced government pressure due to the lack of transparency during the outage (the Bank only noted
that there was a technical issue with the RTGS system and provided no updates on the efforts to restore
service). The British government demanded that BoE obtain an independent report of the outage. The

BoE chose Deloitte, one of the big-four accounting firms, to launch the investigation into the system
outage. The report looked in depth as to what caused the fault and to evaluate the robustness and
governanceofthesystem.Itdeterminedhow welltheBank hadreactedtothedowntimeandwhetherthe
backupplansandincidentmanagementwereeffectiveinsolvingtheissues.
The report showed that the central bank was not fully equipped to handle crises affecting Britain’s banks.
It said that in the absence of robust crisis management arrangements within the Bank, there were
insufficient resources in place to coordinate and communicate response activities. It noted that early
invocation of the backup system on the day could have helped mitigate the immediate impact on the
economy. The report went on to say that the central bank should acknowledge that in certain

Banks’ Dependency on Legacy Systems
Inlarge part,establishedbanks arebuiltonmainframesystemsthatdateback tothe1960s and1970s.It
is difficult for the banks to modify or replace these core legacy systems because of their complexity and
the shortage of the necessary in-house IT skills. These systems are difficult to maintain since the
developers have long since retired or died. Furthermore, the systems tend to be written in COBOL and
PL1;andqualifiedprogrammersintheselanguagesarebecomingfewandfarbetween.
Rather, banks are providing new services such as online banking and mobile banking by developing
custom systems for these services and linking them to the core mainframe systems. Banks are investing

RoyalBankofScotland
The granddaddyof all outages hit the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in June of 2012. It caused weeks of
havoc. The outage was caused by an upgrade gone massively wrong. The bank had decided to upgrade
its batch facility to a new version. It found a problem with the new version and backed it out, returning to
its current version. However, in the process, the IT staff accidentally deleted a key control file, the loss of

It took a week to pinpoint the cause of failure and to resume the batch run. However, during this time,

It took more than two additional weeks to work through the backlog of transactions that had accumulated
during the outage and to resolve all of the problems so that the systems could be returned to normal
operations.

TheLloydsBankingGroupOutage
On the afternoon of January 26, 2014, customers of the banks comprising Lloyds Banking Group could
not use their debit cards nor could they withdraw money from ATMs. The Lloyds Banking Group banks
include Lloyds, TSB, and Halifax. Hundreds of thousands of customers were left at checkout counters or

According to sources, there was no maintenance or update activity going on at the time of the failure.
Rather, the failure was caused by two of seven servers that process debit-card transactions. Conjecture
is that one of the servers was a production server and the other was its backup. It appears that the bank

ThereIsSomeProgress
However, there has been some progress by banks to move to new systems. The Nationwide Building
Society in the U.K., after years of underinvestment, embarked in 2008 on a £1 billion project to upgrade
itsdatacenter.Ithasnowsuccessfullycompleteditslegacysystemoverhaul.
The cloud is also being used for new services. Barclay’s Bank is using cloud computing to create new
services such as a mobile payments app. The application sits in a private cloud and doesn’t use the web

The Embarrassment for BoE
This outage was particularly embarrassing for BoE because it had been warning U.K. banks to guard
against technical failures that could lead to financial instability. Back in January, 2014, a senior BoE
official had said that the U.K. banking systems were “a long way from being robust.” When the BoE
outagehit,oneofthecommoncriticismswasitsearlierremarksabouttherobustnessofotherbanks.
The BoE has now acknowledged that it, too, could be the cause of a wider financial crisis and that it
wouldstrengthen itscrisis-managementcapabilities.
Summary
Thereluctanceforbankstoreplacelegacycoresystemsmakesproblemsinevitable.MostU.K.banks(as
well as banks around the world) still use legacy systems built in the last century that continue to work.
Their reluctance to change these systems has led to several major banking outages. Most banks are

The BoE appears to not be an exception to this observation. As a result of the Deloitte report, BoE has
said that it would strengthen its crisis management procedures. Hopefully, this includes the periodic
testingofitsbackupsystemstoavoidfailoverfaults.
