Social Media Availability and Performance
April2011
Social Networks are Becoming a Fabric of Our Society
Social networking is becoming a mainstay of our life. Though it may not seem critical from a
business viewpoint, to many individuals it is. Not having access to Facebook or not being able to
tweetwhenwewanttocanruinaday.
The availability of social networks and their responsiveness is becoming a factor in the quality of
life of our everyday activities. Forrester’s research1 indicates that as of 2010, 59% of all Internet
users use social networks; and 70% consume information from social networks. These users are
notjustteenagers–70%ofactiveconversationalistsareover30.
Nielsen2 found that people are typically spending five and a half hours per month on social
networking sites. By far the leader is Facebook, which accounts for most of this time. MySpace,
LinkedIn,andTwitterusersaveragelessthananhourpermonth.
In a study of ten countries, citizens of Italy, Australia, and the United States (in that order) spent
over six hours per month networking. At the bottom of the list, surprisingly, was Japan with less

Social Network Availability
Withits continuallyincreasing importance
to society, the availability of social
networks is becoming ever more critical.
AlertSite is a service that provides
monitoring of web sites by periodically
sending requests to them. It publishes a
special studyof social networks,the Web

LinkedIn, Twitter, MySpace, and

Facebook and LinkedIn were almost an order of magnitude less reliable than MySpace, showing

Social Network Performance
Equally as important as availability is
performance.After all, if theresponsetime
of a service is too long, it is effectively
down.
The same AlertSite study measured the
average response time of these social
sites.Facebook was byfar thefastest with
an average response time of a little over a
second. LinkedIn and YouTube had
response times under two seconds.
Though highly available, MySpace’s
response time was over three seconds.
Twitter’s response time was almost five
seconds.
Twitter’s Fail Whales
Twitter’sNewDataCenter
Clearly, Twitter has a ways to go to match its peers in availability and speed. Sightings of
Twitter’s fail whales, an icon that is displayed when Twitter is down, have become all too
common.
Twitter is well aware of this disparity. It had been renting its servers from NTT; but in 2010 it
announced plans to move into a new data facility in Salt Lake City, Utah, by the end of the year.
However, construction problems forced Twitter to move to a temporary data center in
Sacramento,California,instead.
Twitter’sArmageddon
Twitter faced probably its biggest challenge – and its biggest failure – during last year’s World
Cup in mid-2010. Twitter created a special section on its site to highlight the key matches, to
promote special tags to show team allegiance, and to offer special new backgrounds with which
to decorate profiles. However, it was totally unprepared for the volume of tweets that were
generated.
The World Cup was responsible for Twitter’s largest period of sustained activity in its history.
During the final fifteen minutes of the championship game, more than 2,000 tweets per second
were sent. This increased to over 3,000 tweets per second when Spain scored the winning goal.

AlertSite
AlertSite measures a web site’s availability and performance by simulating
typical customer interactions on a company’s home page. It measures how

Summary
Social networks are becoming a part of our lives. Twitter’s experience with the World Cup
illustrates the effect that worldwide events can have on social networks. Add to that the recent
activityinthe Middle East, where demonstrations for democracyhave been organized and driven
bysocialnetworks.
As demand for real-time personal information increases, so do the expectations for availability
and performance. Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn must scale to meet
thesedemands;andinthefuture,theymustbestructuredtoprovidetelephone-gradeavailability.
