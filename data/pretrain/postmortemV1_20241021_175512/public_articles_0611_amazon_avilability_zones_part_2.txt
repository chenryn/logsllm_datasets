AvailabilityZones are distinctlocations within aregion that areengineeredtobe insulatedfrom failures in
other Availability Zones and that provide inexpensive, low latency connectivity to other Availability Zones
in the same region. An Availability Zone is in effect a separate data center in a region. It has its own

power, cooling, and communication infrastructure that is separate from the other Availability Zones in its

An AZ is not necessarily in a different data center from the other AZs. It is only necessary that the data
centerbebuilttoensuretheindependenceoftheAZs.
Elastic IP addresses allow users to run backup EC2 instances in other AZs so that if an AZ fails, the
backupinstancecanrapidlytakeover.

In a basic availability configuration, the production application runs in the primary AZ. In Figure 3, the
production EC2 instance comprises the application and a file system, with transactions received on the
Elastic IP address EIP-1. The file system uses an EBS volume as its block store. A slave copy of the
master EBS volume is configured in the same AvailabilityZone and is kept synchronized with the master
volume via synchronous replication. A snapshot is periodically taken of the master volume and is stored
inS3storage(whichitselfisreplicatedacrossAvailabilityZones).
A backup clone is ready to be launched in a backup AZ. If the primary AZ should fail, the master and
slaveEBSvolumes inthebackupAZ arerebuiltfrom thelastsnapshot.ThebackupEC2instanceis then
launched,andtheEIPaddressisswitchedtothebackupEC2instance.Recoverytimedependsuponthe
boot size for the instance and is typically about 10 minutes plus the time to restore the master and slave
databases (remember – lazy loading allows the applications to begin before database restoration is
complete).

A configuration with higher availability is shown in Figure 4. Two EC2 instances operating in different
AvailabilityZones are given different EIP addresses, and theyshare the transaction load. All applications

Figure4:IntermediateAvailabilityConfiguration
The master and slave EBS volumes are located in different Availability Zones so that there is no delay in
rebuilding the database nor is there any data lost should an AZ fail. If an AZ fails, all further transactions
are routed to the surviving AZ. If the AZ containing the master database is the one that failed, then the
slavedatabaseispromotedtomasterbeforetheapplicationsconnecttoit.

In this case, both EC2 instances must be configured to handle the entire transaction load. Alternatively,
upon an EC2 failure, the surviving EC2 can be reconfigured to handle the additional load. This is a cost
tradeoffthatacceptsslowerresponsetimeuntilthesurvivingEC2instancecanbereconfigured.
AdvancedAvailabilityConfiguration
Availability of this system can be further extended by creating another backup instance of the application
in another AZ should one of the AZ’s fail, as shown in Figure 5. In normal operation, the configuration of
theapplicationisthatshowninFigure4.
Assume that AZ 1 containing the master copy of the database fails. The slave database in AZ 2 is
promoted to master, and the application in AZ 2 reconnects to the new master database in AZ 2. Once
service has been restored, another EC2 instance is created in another AvailabilityZone. It is given the IP
addressEIP-1torestoreredundancy.TheconfigurationhasnowbeenreturnedtothatofFigure4.

Summary
It is often advised not to run critical applications in the cloud. Cloud failures have become all too
commonplace.
Amazon’s AvailabilityZones provide a powerful approachto guarantee survivabilityof critical applications
even if an entire Availability Zone should fail. Each AvailabilityZone is an independent data center that is
fault-isolated from other Availability Zones. Application instances can be run in two or more Availability
Zones either as multiple operational instances or as active/backup pairs. Should an Availability Zone fail,
an instance in another Availability Zone can take over the processing of the application instance in the
failedAvailabilityZone.
