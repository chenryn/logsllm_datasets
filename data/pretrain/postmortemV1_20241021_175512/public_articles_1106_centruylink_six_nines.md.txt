CenturyLink Targets Six Nines
June2016
The U.S. telco giant CenturyLink is aiming to offer its customers six nines of reliability
in its SLAs (Service Level Agreements).1 This is an extraordinary level of reliability. It
means that, on the average, its service will be down for only thirty seconds per year.
Of course,this doesn’t implythatitmaybedownthirtyseconds everyyear.Itmightbedownfiveminutes
everytenyears.Nevertheless,itisanavailabilitythatisdifficulttoachieve.
CenturyLink has yet to issue its SLA guaranteeing six 9s of availability. It will be interesting to see how
strongly it stands by this commitment. SLAs have a tendency to make big guarantees with minor
penalties.
For instance, an Amazon SLA for its S3 (Simple Storage Service) data storage service guarantees a
99.9% uptime.2 If the service does not achieve 99.9% uptime but does achieve at least 99% uptime (88
hours of downtime in a year), then 10% of the monthly fee charged to the customer would be applied
against the next month’s charges. This adjustment would applyif S3 was down for more than 45 minutes
permonth,anditcoversdowntimeuptosevenandahalfhourspermonth.
For a typical customer, this might amount to a few hundred dollars a month in compensation for hours of
lost business. Of course, for Amazon, it could amount to millions of dollars spread over its very large
customerbase.
CenturyLink plans to improve its availability to this level as it rolls out new data centers. However, the
company has a long way to go to achieve its goals. For instance, its CenturyLink Cloud includes a

 It the user has access to some applications but not to all of them, is he down? Do you apply a

Somehow, the calculation of an average downtime per user or the average downtime per application
mustbespecifiedintheSLA.
The achievement of very high levels of availability such as five 9s or six 9s requires extremely rapid
recovery time. The system supporting the application must be architected to recover in seconds. Taking

One example of extraordinarily high availability is your telephone’s dial tone.When was the last time you
