The FAA’s Availability Woes
December2009
Without a filed flight plan, a commercial airliner can’t fly. This was painfully demonstrated on
Thursday, November 19, 2009, when the FAA’s1 National Airspace Data Interchange Network
(NADIN)failedatabout5:30AMEasternTimeandwasdownforthreehours.2
NADIN isusedbytheaircarriersandgeneralaviationtoenterflightplansinto
the National Airspace System (NAS). These flight plans are routed to the
appropriate air traffic control facilities, including those airport control towers
andenroutetrafficcontrolcentersthatwillhandletheflight.
NADIN uses the services of the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI)
to communicate across the National Airspace System. It seems that on
November 19th, a scheduled maintenance on FTI in Los Angeles corrupted a router in Salt Lake
City. The router’s backup failed to take over, and the FTI services upon which NADIN depended
werelost(aclassicfailoverfault).
With NADIN down, air carriers could no longer enter their flight plans into the FAA’s systems.
Instead, they had to fax or email their flight plans to the FAA so that controllers could enter the
flight plans manually. With 50,000 flight plans filed per day, the backlog built quickly; and planes
sat on the tarmac, often for hours, waiting for takeoff clearance. Often, a flight was simply
cancelledbytheaircarrier.
Fortunately, the failure occurred early in the
morning. Affected most were flights originating on
the East Coast of the U.S., though delays spread
across the country as equipment needed for later
flights never arrived on time. The delays were the
longest at the busiest East Coast airports,
including Atlanta, Washington, New York, and
Chicago. Because planes could not take off,
those airports were handling only 40% to 50% of
the traffic that they normally handled – the rest
wereonthegroundwaiting.

The FTI failure took down not only flight planning but also Notices to Airmen (Notams) as well.
Notams advise pilots of temporary problems such as airport runway closures and navigation aid
outages. It also cut off communications between many different FAA computers that normally
coordinate flight delays to minimize the time that airliners must wait. The relaying of weather
information to pilots was affected. However, radar and air/ground communication services were
notaffected.Therewasnosafetyproblem.

The Flight Planning Process
AflightplanisfiledwiththeFAAforeverycommercialflightandforanygeneralaviationflightthat

air traffic control system of the type and

and altitude, the time of departure, the
durationoftheflight,thepilot,andthefuel
andthenumberofpersonsonboard.
The FAA computers may modify the flight
plan based on other traffic and preferred
routes, and the approved flight plan is
returnedtothepilot.
NADIN
WhatisNADIN?
The FAA’s NADIN system processes flight plans for everyfiled flight in the U.S. Air carriers enter
flight plans directly into the NADIN system, which approves them and then forwards them over
the FTI network to the appropriate air traffic control facilities. (General aviation pilots generally
enter flight plans over the Webor phone them into a flightservice specialist, who enters the flight
plansforthem.)

NADIN is a 24-year-old system managed by Harris Corp. It has redundant centers in Atlanta and
Salt Lake City. These centers back each other up. Should one fail, the other is intended to carry
thefullflight-planningload.
However, with the FTI backbone network down, no flight plans could be communicated to either
NADIN system. Consequently, air carriers were reduced to faxing or emailing their flight plans to
FAA personnel, who then entered them manually into the NADIN system. With a volume of
50,000 flight plans per day, this was a cumbersome and time-consuming process. Flight plans
couldnotbeapproved,andaircraftcouldnotmove.
NADIN’sFailureHistory
There have been at least nine failures in flight communications systems in the past three years.
Though the November 19th failure could not be attributed to the NADIN system (it was an FTI
fault),NADINhasnotbeenwithoutitsproblems.
Friday,June8,2007
On the morning of Friday, June 8th,2007, the Atlanta NADIN center failed. As planned, all flight
planning activity was transferred to the Salt Lake City NADIN center. However, this overloaded
the Salt Lake City Center; and it, too, failed. Though the centers were returned to service in late
morning, delays ranging up to four hours lingered into the late afternoon. Tens of thousands of
passengerswereinconvenienced.
May,2008
In May of 2008, the FAA’s NOTAM system, related to NADIN, failed and was down for almost a
day. The crash was caused by a disk failure in an end-of-life Sun system. Failover to a backup
system was attempted, but it failed also. It turns out that the data corruption caused by the
primary disk failure also corrupted the backup disk (RAID arrays were not being used).

Tuesday,August26,2008
On Tuesday, August 26, 2008, at about 1:30 pm, the Atlanta NADIN facility crashed. All flight-
planning activity was routed to the Salt Lake City center. Flight plans that had been filed with
Atlanta had to be refiled. However, the total flight-planning activity so overloaded the Salt Lake
Citycenter that it, too, once again crashed. As of mid-afternoon, the FAA stopped accepting new
flight plans.Thedelays becamesobadat allmajor airports thattheFAAstopped predictingflight

FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI)
WhatisFTI?
The FTI system is an IP backbone that provides communication services between all FAA
facilities.3 It replaces seven aging legacy telecommunications systems and provides routing,
network monitoring,andsecurityservices for voice,dataandvideocommunications tomorethan
4,000FAAandDefenseDepartmentfacilities.

FTI began phasing over in 2002, carrying a price tag of $2.4 billion. It currently supports 50,000
users using integrated satellite and microwave links over optical networks with over 100,000
manageabledevices.
It was an FTI failure that took down the NADIN flight planning service on November 19th. It, too,
hashadaless-than-stellarfailurehistory.
On May 24, 2005, an FTI failure at O’Hare Airport in Chicago delayed over 100 flights. The
problemwascausedbyanincorrectconfigurationofcommunicationequipment.
On September 21, 2007, all flights coming into Los Angeles were delayed due to a computer
malfunction. All flights within a one-hour flight time of Los Angeles were put on ground hold until
theproblemwascorrected.
On September 25, 2007, all FTI services were lost at the Memphis Air Route Traffic Control
Center (ARTCC), one of 20 enroute control centers in the contiguous United States. 566 flights
were delayed for up to several hours. The problem was in a failure of an optical ring network that
issupposedtobefaulttolerant(trafficcanflowineitherdirectionaroundthering).
On November 9, 2007, all primary and alternate FTI services were lost at the Jacksonville
ARTCC,delayingalmost100flights.
NextGen – The FAA’s Next Generation System
TheU.S.air traffic controlsystem is old.Itis builtontheradar andradiotechnologies of the‘50s;
and it is becoming increasingly difficult for it to handle today’s air traffic, which is expected to
double or triple over the next one to two decades. It is written in obsolete languages, it is difficult
toupgrade,andhardwareandsoftwarecrashesarebecomingincreasinglycommon.
So what is the FAA doing about this? Its answer is NextGen – the next generation air traffic
controlsystemthatwillbephasedin,withthefinalgoaltobeupandrunninginfullby2025.
WhatIsNextGen?
NextGen is a transformation of the entire U.S. national air transportation system.4 It replaces
legacyground-basednavigation(radar,navigationaids)andground/air voicecommunication with
satellite-basedtechnologyanddigitalcommunication.Itcomprisesthefollowingcomponents:
ADS-B
Automatic DependentSurveillanceBroadcast(ADS-B) is thebackboneof theNextGensystem.It
uses GPSsatellitecoordinates toprovidecontrollers andpilots withmuchmoreaccurateposition
informationthanisavailabletodaywithradarsurveillance.
Transponders located ineveryplanebroadcasttheir locations andaltitudes toother aircraftinthe
vicinity and to air traffic control facilities. Pilots are given a digital display of nearby traffic with
collisionwarnings.
The greatly improved positional accuracy allows separation between planes to be substantially
reduced, thus increasing the capacity of our airspace. In addition, GPS navigation allows planes
toflydirectroutesrather thanhavingtofollowpredefinedairways.This willnotonlysavetimebut
fuelaswell.

DigitalCommunications
Digital communications will replace much of the voice traffic between pilots and controllers.
Though voice communications will still be used for immediate requirements such as collision
alerts, other information such as weather, neighboring traffic, and route changes will be
communicateddirectlytocockpitdisplays.
NetworkEnabledWeather
Network Enabled Weather will provide a common digital weather picture across the National
Airspace System (NAS).Itwillusetens of thousands of global weather observations andsensors

old.Itwillprovidethefoundationforallair/groundandground/groundvoicecommunications.
NextGenAdvantages
Among the many advantages that NextGen will bring to the U.S. national aviation transportation
systemare:
 Flightsafetywillbeimprovedduetoincreasedpilotawarenessofnearbytraffic.
 Flights will be able to go direct rather than have to follow predefined airways (the current
system,whichisakintoanairborneinterstatehighwaysystem).
 Therewillbefewerweatherdelays.
 Therewillbefewerin-flightdelaysduetocongestion.
 Airport operations will be improved. The same satellite technology used in the air will be
usedatairportstoreduceseparationandimprovesafety.
 It will eliminate billions of dollars of annual costs to the U.S. economy due to gridlock in
theskies.
WhereDoesNextGenStand?
This is the disappointing part. NextGen is scheduled to be in place by 2025 at a cost of $22
billion. Many of its features will be showing up in the 2012 to 2018 time frame (ADS-B is already
beingtestedinAlaskaandbyUPS).
However, the FAA’s budget authorization expired in 2007. Since then, it has lived on a
successionoftemporarybudgetextensionsandactingadministrators.

In effect, the FAA has been a victim of its own success. As President Lyndon Johnson said, “If it
ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Congress has unfortunately been following that dictum. Progress is being
hamperedbytwomainfundingissues:
 Thesplitofservicefeesbetweencommercialandbusinessaviation.
 Thecost/benefitanalysisoftheairlinesequippingtheirplaneswiththenewtechnology.
Until NextGen gets fully funded, we will have to live with the U.S.’ current tottering air traffic
controlsystem.
Lessons Learned
One obvious lesson to be learned from the FAA’s experiences is that each node in a redundant
system must be configured to handle the full application load should the other node fail. The
repeated failure of the Salt Lake City NADIN Center to handle the full flight-planning load
followinganAtlantaCenterfailureis,onthefaceofit,inexcusable.
Another observation with questionable merit is that mission-critical, 24x7 systems that are
decades old can be held together with baling wire and chewing gum. But for how much longer?

Finally, the old tongue-in-cheek saying maybe more true every daythat Congress puts NextGen
onhold:
