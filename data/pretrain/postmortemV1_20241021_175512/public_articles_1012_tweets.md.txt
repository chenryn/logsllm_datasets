– Our December Twitter Feed of Outages
December2015
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass. With our new Twitter presence, we don’t have to feel
guilty.Thisarticlehighlightssomeofthetweetsthatmadeheadlinesinrecentdays.
SpaceXtakesa“revolutionary”steptowardreusablerockets
A Falcon 9 first stage makes a controlled landing 10 minutes after launch. On December 21st,
SpaceX gave us a “revolutionary moment” when the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket landed upright
on a converted launch pad at Cape Canaveral, just a few miles from where it had taken off 10
minutes earlier. It was the first time a conventional rocket returned to Earth intact after delivering
payloads (11 small satellites) to orbit. (Blue Origin’sNewShepard, whichmade a similar softlanding
lastmonth,isnotanorbitalvehicle.)

From the Availability Digest: "Protecting Big Data – ErasureCoding"
Big Data has changed the landscape of data storage. A company’s data is always precious, and the
loss of any of it can be devastating to the IT functions upon which the company depends. With Big
Data being stored on hundreds or even thousands of disks, how does one protect that data from
loss?Erasurecodesaretheanswer.

Myths and facts about backup, restore and disaster recovery
With the rise of digital data, changing technology, and common usage of personal devices, the IT
world has become ever more complex, with new challenges around every corner. In the wake of
such quick changes and complexity, many individuals end up exaggerating the difficulties found
within these new systems and thereby begin spreading some major falsehoods within this vast IT
sphere.

Digest Mng Editor Bill Highleyman was chief developer of one of thevery first modems. Alittle
bit of history. Read "Modem Memories" here.
Data communication has come a long way since AT&T (American Telephone and Telegraph) first
introduced it in the late 1950s. Digest Managing Editor Bill Highleyman was recently taken on a
nostalgic trip back to those early days while touring the Computer History Museum in Mountain
View, California. At Bell Telephone Laboratories, he supervised the development group that
designed one of the very first modems (modulator/demodulator) for the transmission of data over
telephone lines – the DataPhone 103. He was amazed to see a DataPhone 103 in a display case in
theMuseum,andthememoriesreturned.

HowtomanagetheInternetofThings
From smart buildings to intelligent production lines, organizations are rapidly adopting Internet-
connected devices to improve performance, reduce costs and transform customer experience.
However, there is a massive gap in expectation and language between IT and operational teams
deploying the Internet of Things (IoT), not least that these IP-connected devices must be
continuously available – in contrast to the five nines break-fix approach to corporate networks. So

IBM LinuxONE Provides New Optionsfor Linux Deployment
In August 2015, IBM announced LinuxONE. It is anchored by two new Linuxmainframe servers that
capitalize on best-of-class mainframe security and performance and that bring these strengths to
open-source-based technologies and the Open Source community. The move creates greater
choice for Linux applications in enterprises where IT is under constant pressure to provide
breakthrough systems in areas where the IBM z System mainframe excels, such as analytics and
hybridclouds.

Stay Out of the Dark: Applying Predictive Analytics to Generators
Data centers may be considered the “brain” of a company; but in the event of a power failure,
generators are key to keeping that brain running and reliable. The generator is what holds the whole
building together during a utility failure, and it is arguably the most critical piece of equipment in a
mission critical facility. Despite the significance of generators, somestudiessuggest generator
