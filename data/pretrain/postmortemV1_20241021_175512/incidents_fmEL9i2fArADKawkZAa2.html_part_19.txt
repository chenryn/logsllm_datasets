Summary: Multiple Cloud products experiencing elevated error rates,
latencies or service unavailability in europe-west2

Description: We are experiencing an issue with multiple cloud products
beginning on Tuesday, 2022-07-19 06:33 US/Pacific.

Our engineering team continues to investigate the issue.

We will provide an update by Tuesday, 2022-07-19 11:45 US/Pacific with
current details.

We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.

**Product Impact:**

**Google Cloud Storage:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers with data in the impacted region will
    see elevated errors when attempting to read objects
-   Workaround: None at this time.
-   Impact mitigated at 08:53 US/Pacific for Google Cloud Storage

**Google BigQuery:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Datasets will be unavailable for the impacted
    locations.
-   Workaround: None at this time.

**Google App Engine and Cloud Functions:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers may experience high error rates for
    Google App Engine and Cloud Functions in europe-west2 for requests
    coming through Cloud Pubsub, Eventarc, Cloud Tasks, and Cloud
    Scheduler. Pubsub, Eventarc, and Cloud Tasks traffic will be
    automatically retried once the outage is resolved. Cloud Scheduler
    requests will need to be resubmitted.
-   Workaround: Customers are advised to fail over to another region if
    possible.

**DataFlow:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Dataflow Streaming jobs already running in the
    impacted area may be stuck. New Dataflow jobs may not start.
-   Workaround: Customers are advised to run their jobs in another
    region.

**Cloud Composer:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: All operations will experience downgraded
    performance in europe-west2.
-   Workaround: None at this time.

**Cloud Filestore:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: europe-west2-a is unavailable for all customers
-   Workaround: Customers are advised to fail over to another region if
    possible.

**Cloud SQL:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Non-HA instances are hard-down in europe-west2-a.
    HA instances are down in europe-west2-a (pending zonal failover).
    Following ops are failing in all three zones, but mostly in
    europe-west2-a: Backups, creates, DMS migrations, updates, deletes,
    recreates (internal), restarts, exports.
-   Workaround: None at this time.

**Memory Store for Redis:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers will experience timeouts for management
    api (create,update,delete,etc), and cache flushes
-   Workaround: None at this time.

**Persistent Disk:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers won\'t be able to create any PD device
    in europe-west2. PD devices in europe-west2-a may be unavailable.
-   Workaround: Create PD devices in a different region/zone.

**API Gateway:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers may see elevated 5xx errors in
    europe-west2
-   Workaround: None at this time.

**Cloud Spanner**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers that stay below our recommended CPU
    usage 65% SR, 45% MR should not see impact. Customers that are above
    the limit might see latency impact.
-   Workaround: For eur5 customers can chose to route to europe-west1,
    no workarounds needed for europe-west2

**GKE:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Certain portions of clusters with presence in
    europe-west2-a may be unavailable
-   Workaround: Customers are encouraged to move their workloads to
    other regions if possible.

**Looker:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers hosted in europe-west2 will experience
    significantly increased failed requests.
-   Workaround: None at this time.

**Google Cloud Tasks:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers will experience high latency for all API
    requests. Some queues are not being loaded and they stop executing
    tasks. Customers may also see high delivery latency for their tasks,
    depending on which cell is serving their queues.
-   Workaround: None at this time.

**Google Compute Engine:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: The impact details for GCE are externalized at
    <https://status.cloud.google.com/incidents/XVq5om2XEDSqLtJZUvcH>
-   Workaround: Please refer to GCE posting at
    <https://status.cloud.google.com/incidents/XVq5om2XEDSqLtJZUvcH>

**Cloud Data Fusion:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis : Customers in europe-west2 will not be able to
    create new pipelines
-   Workaround: None at this time.
