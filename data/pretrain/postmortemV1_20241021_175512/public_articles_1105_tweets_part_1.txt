– Our May Twitter Feed of Outages
May2016
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass.With our new Twitter presence, we don’t
have to feel guilty. This article highlights some of the tweets that made headlines in
recentdays.
ThecostofblackoutsinEurope
In January 2005, a severe storm swept across Northern Europe from Ireland to Russia. More than
500,000 homes were left without power, with Denmark and Southern Sweden being particularly
hard-hit. And five nuclear power plants had to be shut down due to saltwater seeping into electricity
distribution plants. Assessing the social and economic impact of power outages caused by extreme
weather helps decision makers and grid operators in Europe take adequate measures to ensure
futurepowersupply.

Weaselknocksoutworld'spowerfulaccelerator
CERN'sLarge Hadron Collider, the world's biggest particle accelerator, lost power on Friday 29
April.Engineerswho wereinvestigating the outagemade a grislydiscovery-- the charred remainsof
a weasel. The little critter gnawed through a 66-kilovolt transformer inside an electrical facility
outside the main building. Just for perspective, one kilovolt is 1,000 volts of energy. Chewing the
wiring ended up frying the creature into oblivion and causing a wide power outage around CERN,
the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The unexpected power loss shut down the Large
HadronColliderforatleastaweek.

The number of power outages in the UK rose dramatically in 2015 and resulted in widespread
productivity losses across industry. The latest Blackout Tracker report says there were 640 outages
in 2015, a marked increase on the 537 incidents recorded in 2014. The report also found that a total
of 2,564,827 people were affected by the outages, which lasted for an average of 50 minutes. The
statistics highlight the problem of unreliable electricity supply at a time when the UK’s ageing energy
infrastructureiscomingunderincreasingpressure.

Google’sCloudCrashBadNews
On Monday, April 11th, at about 7 PM Pacific Time, Google’s cloud service,Google Compute
Engine, went completely dark. The outage lasted almost twenty minutes. The outage was worldwide
and on all servers. No Google Compute Engine customeranywhere in the world was able to use the
services, meaning that countless server backends were rendered utterly useless during the outage.
Files were lost, settings were reset and all the other trappings of a backend outage visited all of
Google Compute Engine’s customers. This happened despite Google having systems in place to
prevent exactly this sort of thing from happening, including numerous security protocols on the
hardware and software level as well as multiple backup servers. Naturally, this put serious egg on
Google’sface at a time when they’re struggling to gain ground on MicrosoftAzure and AmazonWeb
Services. For an outage of this scale to occur, something major had to have happened. As it turns
out,Googlepublishedalong-windedexplanation.

Continuous Deployment with Containers
The open source release of Docker in March 2013 triggered a major shift in the way in which the
software development industry has been aspiring to package and deploy modern applications. The
creation of many competing, complementary and supporting container technologies has followed in
the wake of Docker. Thishas lead to much hype and some disillusion. This article series aims to cut
through some of the confusion and explains how containers are actually being used within the
enterprise.
