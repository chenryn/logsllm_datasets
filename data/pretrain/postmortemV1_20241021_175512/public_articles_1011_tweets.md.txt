– Our November Twitter Feed of Outages
November2015
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass. With our new Twitter presence, we don’t have to feel
guilty.Thisarticlehighlightssomeofthetweetsthatmadeheadlinesinrecentdays.

Paris Airport Grounds Flights afterWindows3.1 (!) Glitch
If you've ever flown through Paris's Orly airport, you've definitely encountered Windows 3.1.
Yes, some pretty critical systems at Orly still run Windows 3.1. Unfortunately, the Windows
3.1-based DECOR system went down in November. In doing so, it prevented air traffic
controllers from giving pilots critical information. As a result, Orly airport had to ground its
flights while teams worked to fix whatever it was that was preventing DECOR from working.

NewMethodsofMaximizingYourOldestDataCenterTechnology
No matter how “high tech” your data center, there is a high likelihood that the backup power system
of your critical facility is completely dependent on a room full of batteries. Data center surveys have
shown that anywhere between 65 percent to as high as 85 percent of unplanned downtime can be
attributedto batteryfailureofsomekind.Thismeansyourfacilityisalmostcertainlyatthemercyofa

Heading to NonStop Boot Camp? Check out Digest Mng Ed. Bill Highleyman's talk on "Will a
BackupSystemMeetYourAvailabilityRequirements?"
Your CTO is concerned about running his critical applications on a single NonStop system at a
singlesitethatmightsuffersomedisastersuchasafire orflood.He wouldlike you to builda backup
site that has the capacity to take over processing from the production site should there be a system
or site failure. He isalso assuming that providing a backup system will increase the availabilityof his
mission-critical applications by several 9s. Is he correct in this assumption? We show the effect of
failover times and failover faults on the availability enhancements provided by a backup system. If
failoversare well-scripted and well-tested, a backup system might add another 9 of availability. If the
two systems are run as an active/active pair, the overall system availability can be increased by a
second 9. This means that the active/active pair is one-hundred times more reliable than a single
system. Participants in this session will learn how to evaluate the impact of failover times and
failoverfaultsontheavailabilityprovidedbytheirredundantsystems.

The scale ofBritain’s energy supply crunchwas laid bare on Wednesday as an unexpected outage
of power plants sent wholesale electricity prices soaring and prompted the grid operator to call for

If you looked at therecent IBM numbers, which were pretty painful but in line with what generally
happens when a company is adapting to a major industry change, you saw one bright light: IBM’s
mainframe business was growing faster than the server segment in general is growing. The
mainframe was declared dead 30 years ago. And there is only one creature, mythological or

IsTheUnitedStatesPreparedFor AMassiveCyberattack?
As a child of refugees in London, journalist Ted Koppel witnessed the Blitz. Traveling the world as
one of America’s most distinguished television reporters, he lived through the Cold War and
witnessed combat up close from Vietnam to Iraq. In his new book,Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A
Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath, he argues that the threat posed by cyber warfare is
more complicated to defend against, potentially more deadly than traditional warfare, and we are
absolutelyunpreparedforit.

Not many people realize that undersea cables transport nearly100% of transoceanic data traffic.
These lines are laid on the very bottom of the ocean floor. The reality is that the cloud is actually
under the ocean. Even though they might seem behind the times, fiber-optic cables are actually
