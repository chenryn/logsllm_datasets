Can a Country Shut Down Its Internet?
October2016
Can a country shut down its own Internet? It depends. Probably not in the United
States, Britain, or the Western European countries. But countries in Africa and Asia
have done so frequently. Reasons range from stifling dissent to preventing cheating
onexams.
How Does a Country Shut Down It’s Internet
A government’s ability to shut down its country’s internet depends upon its control of the Internet Service
Providers (ISPs). These are typically private-sector companies that provide services for accessing and
using the Internet. If the government has the authority or the will to do so, it can force its ISPs to power
down routers, change routing tables, or do other damage to the Internet so that it is not usable by its
citizens.

There are sixty-one countries in which there are only one or two providers connecting to the outside
world. These countries include Lybia and Syria. In these countries, shutting down the Internet is a trivial
task.Allittakesistoturnoffpowertoacoupleofcentralfacilities.

Why Some Countries Can’t
It would be nearly impossible for a government to shut down the Internet in the United States or in
Western Europe. There are just toomaypaths into and out of these countries. A government would have

Besides, U.S. law prevents such an authoritarian action, even in a time of crisis. However, a bill
introduced into the U.S. Senate entitled “Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset” would provide the
president with an Internet kill switch to be used in the event of a national cyber-emergency. It is intended
toprotecttheU.S.infrastructurefromcyber-terrorists.

The Internet has been shut down in Syria, Libya, North Korea, Burma, Nepal, Maldives, Iran, and Egypt.

Egypt
Egypt turned off its Internet on January 28, 2011. Doing so was relatively easy for Egypt, since the
government owns the main service provider, Telecom Egypt. Even so, it took Egypt five days to
accomplishthisfeat.
Egypt ordered its country’s five main ISPs to barricade online traffic. The Egyptian ISPs altered the
routing information in their Border Gateway Protocols1 to stop resolving addresses ending in “.eg,”
Egypt’s domain name.This in effectshutdownallthe routers thatfilter traffic,throwingawayall incoming

Egyptian legislation the authorities have the right to issue such an order and we are obliged to
complywithit.TheEgyptianauthoritieswillbeclarifyingthesituationinduecourse.”
Iraq
In early July, 2016, Iraq’s government turned off all broadband and mobile broadband connections,

In 2015, it was reported that Iraq imposed fifteen shutdowns of its Internet. In 2014, Iraq ordered specific

For Iraq, turning off the Internet is relatively straightforward. The government owns the majority of the
country’s communication network, including the fibre-optic backbone that connects the country’s major
cities. The Iraq government sells bandwidth to ISPs who use the backbone to communicate within the
countryandwiththeoutsideworld.Thus,thegovernmentcanturnofftheInternetwithimpunity
Syria
On Thursday, November 29, 2012, everyone in Syria discovered that they had no Internet service. The
Syrian government had intentionally caused the blackout to make life difficult for rebels in the country.

granted or not. Notwithstanding the legalities of the acts, there have been many cases in which
