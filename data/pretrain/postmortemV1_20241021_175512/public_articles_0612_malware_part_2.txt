that leads to the incarceration of big-time hackers, cybercriminals evaluate what happened; and their
tactics evolve from the lessons learned. The main lesson learned from the law enforcement successes is
perhapsthatbiggerisn’tbetter.Mini-breachesattractlessattentionandthereforearelessrisky.
As a consequence, cybercriminals are now going after easier targets that provide a smaller but steady
stream of compromised data and its resulting revenue. Though financial-service companies remain a
major target for some cyber groups, these companies are no longer the predominant focus of
cybercriminals. Rather, companies such as hotels, restaurants, and retail stores are becoming the
predominanttargets.
Going hand-in-hand with this modus operandi, the people behind breaches are no longer wholesalers
stealing millions of credit-card numbers and selling them on the black market. Rather, they are using the

TheInternetComestotheRescueoftheCybercriminals–TheCarrot
Launching an effective attack on a well-protected company takes a lot of skill, time, and resources. Why

Underground developers all over the world are making this attractive. A raft of prepackaged malware has
recentlybecomeavailableontheInternet.Someisforsale;someis,ineffect,open-sourceandfree.
Manyof thesemalware packages arecustomizable.Theyprovide abasic backdoor or a basic keylogger,
for instance, which can be modified to meet the hacker’s specific needs through a GUI interface. Just a
few clicks and the hacker has his chosen malware, customized to launch the specific attack he has in
mind.Furthermore,ifheisaseriousandfrequenthacker,hecanmodifyhismalwareperiodicallytoavoid

Furthermore, there is a growing use of antiforensic capabilities being included in the customizable
malware. Techniques such as data-wiping (deleting evidence of an attack) and data-hiding (hiding or

obfuscating data via encryption or steganography) are making commodity malware harder to detect and
hardertotrackbacktotheperpetrator.
Verizon found that the majority of highly automated attacks against small organizations in 2010 used
customized malware. The cost of launching such attacks is low, and the skill requirements are becoming
minimal. The technologyis growing ever more accessible to an increasing number of criminals. Verizon’s
data shows that the requirement for a high skill level for successful attacks dropped from 90% of all
incidentsinprior yearstojust8%in2010.
This is Malware as a Service. It is changing the face of automated attacks against secured information
assets.
The New Demographics
Several observations from the 2010 data support the fact that cybercriminals have moved from large,
difficult targets to smaller, softer, less risky ones. Restaurants, hotels, and retail establishments
accounted for 65% of all incidents. Over half of the successful attacks were against organizations with
lessthan100employees.
Even more telling is the distribution of compromised records. In past years, over 90% of such records
were stolen from financial firms. In 2010, this number dropped to 35% - an almost two-thirds reduction.
56%ofcompromisedrecordscamefromretailstores,hotels,andrestaurants.
Several other statistics in the 2011 DBIR also point to the supposition that it is the smaller firms that are
experiencing attacks. Large firms have typically implemented sophisticated security measures for
detecting and containing data breaches, Not so, evidently, for small firms, as is shown by how they
discovered the breaches, how long it took them to discover the breaches, and how unsophisticated they
wereintheirsecuritydefenses.
BreachDiscovery
The smaller firms were not proactive in discovering breaches. In fact, they often did not discover
breaches atall.In86%oftheincidents,it wassomethirdpartythatdiscoveredthebreachandreportedit
to the company. Third parties included customers, partners, and law enforcement agencies. Many of the
breaches were discovered by banks and credit-card companies using CPP (Common Point of Purchase)
investigations, which identify suspected fraud based on the purchase histories of stolen cards and
accountnumbers.
5%ofallbreacheswerereportedbyemployeeswhosawoddthingshappening.
Only 6% of breaches were discovered by a process specifically designed for breach detection, such as
logging to a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system. Tragically, Verizon’s forensic
analyses discovered that 69% of all breaches were detectable from data contained in a company’s
system logs.Clearly,mostof thebreachedcompanies hadnocapabilitytomakeeffectiveuseof their log
informationonatimelybasis.
Verizon notes that how victim companies discover a breach is an indicator of how well they know and
monitor their own environments. An effective way to contain a breach is to consolidate log activity in a
SIEM and to use a log-analysis tool to rapidlydetect suspected intrusions. If all breached companies had
adoptedthistechnology,thenumberofbreachescouldhavebeenreducedbyafactoroftwo-thirds!
Timespan
Good security measures should quickly detect and contain a security breach. Verizon defines three time
phasesforbreachcontainment:

 Compromise–Thetimefrompointofentrytotheactualdatacompromise.
 Discovery–Thetimefromthedatacompromisetothediscoverythattherehasbeenabreach.
 Containment–Thetimefromthediscoveryofthebreachtothecontainmentofitseffects.
Interestingly, over half of all attacks took days or moretoreachthepoint of compromise.This timeperiod
is the window of opportunity for a company to detect an intrusion and to stop it. Clearly, even several
dayswasnotenoughformanysmallcompaniestonoticeanattackinprogress.
Once a company’s data had been compromised, three-quarters of the companies took weeks to months
to discover the breach. This is perhaps explained by the fact that many of these companies were notified
as a result of a CPP investigation, which can take this long. Less than 5% of companies discovered the
compromise within hours of its occurrence. These were probablythe larger companies with sophisticated
securityprotectionsinplace.
After an intrusion was discovered, it took two-thirds of the companies weeks to months to contain the
intrusion. This has to be particularly frustrating to a company when it knows that its data is being stolen

PCIDSSCompliance
Many of the victim companies were required to be PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standard) compliant. How did the small companies that were the targets of these attacks fare in this
regard?
Not well. 89% of the victim companies had not validated their compliance within the last twelve months,
as required by the standard. Most companies encrypted data at rest and in transit because these are
capabilities supplied by their equipment vendors. However, they were noncompliant in the following
areas.Theyfailedto:

Verizon’s Recommendations
Verizon ends its report with several recommendations for best security practices, many of which are
particularly relevant to small organizations. As might be expected, the recommendations do not depart
verymuchfromVerizon’spreviousreports.Therecommendationsinclude:

Summary
The Verizon 2011 DBIR demonstrates that small companies must become more proficient in the
protection of their information assets. Cybercriminals are moving away from the difficult, high-risk targets
suchas financial-service organizations and are insteadfocusing their efforts onsofter targets that require
lessskillandthatareoflessinteresttolawenforcement.
Thismoveis beingpropelledforwardbytheprolific availabilityontheInternetof sophisticatedmalwareof
all types. These products not only are easily customizable, but they also are increasingly using powerful
antiforensic techniques to prevent their detection and to hinder the determination of the source of the
attacks.With this malware, data theft is no longer the province of the skilled few. It is becoming available
tothenefariousmasses.
The absence of mega-breaches seems to have been an anomalyin 2010. 2011 alreadyhas experienced
its share of targeted mega-breaches, including Sony, Espilon, RSA, Steam, and Citigroup. Companies
must continue their efforts to protect against these mega-breaches. Nevertheless, Malware as a Service
is moving the focus of good security practices into the little companies that right now are ill-prepared to
providegoodsecuritycontrols.Verizonestimatesthat96%ofallbreaches wereavoidable withoutdifficult
