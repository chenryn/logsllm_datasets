Introduction
“The purpose of an investigation is to understand how things usually
go right as a basis for explaining how things occasionally go wrong.”
—Erik Hollnagel, Safety-I and Safety-II
Most traditional accident investigations tend to focus on discovering things around an event
that never actually happened. In an attempt to prevent future accidents, there is an underlying
assumption (Shorrock, 2014) for this somewhat peculiar emphasis, which is:
Someone did not do something they should have, according to
someone else.
Through this lens, what generally surfaces in investigations are “findings” about what people did not
do (pay attention, make the right decision, etc.) rather than what they actually did. Without anyone
really noticing, these items get labeled as “human error” and through a seductive and convenient
contortion of logic, an event that never actually happened is deemed after the fact as the “cause”
of the accident. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this results in an obvious recommendation for the future:
“Next time, do what you should.”
Unfortunately, this approach does not result in the safer and improved future we want.
The perspective now known as the “New View” on accidents and mistakes flips this thinking around,
providing a different path to improvement and learning (Dekker, 2002). We wholeheartedly believe
in this approach at Etsy. We’ve invested in operationalizing it on an organizational level (Allspaw,
2010) and have shared our perspective publicly:
“Adaptability and learning. We learn through honest, blameless
reflection on lessons and surprises. We believe that traditional root-
cause analysis makes learning from mistakes difficult. Our blameless
post-mortem process is a widely-cited technique that we believe is
becoming best practice among organizations that value innovation.
Blameless postmortems drive a significant percentage of our

development as we analyze what about our production environment
was less than optimal and rapidly make corresponding adjustments.”
(Etsy, Inc., 2015)
How a postmortem 1 debriefing (hereafter “debriefing”) is done (in whatever form it takes) is at
the core of the approach, and therefore hinges on the expertise of the debriefing facilitator. Over
the years, we have developed an internal course at Etsy focused on building a strong bench of
debriefing facilitators. At the time of writing, this course is comprised of:
• Three seminars covering the theoretical and empirical foundations of accident models,
historical case studies, topics of “Just Culture” and Safety-I/II (with readings and written
exercises)
• An interactive workshop for facilitators to practice core skills
• Shadowing and feedback for new facilitators
• Regular follow-up discussion groups
This guide is intended to be a lightweight set of techniques and tactics distilled from the full course,
designed to help facilitators develop and sharpen their debriefing facilitation skills.
1 Postmortem in this sense could be seen as an ‘after-action review’ or ‘incident review.’ The term is unfortunately
inaccurate and confusing across domains (such as medicine), but is nevertheless part of the software domain lexicon
at the current time.

What Brought Us to Write This
Modern businesses critically rely on software, and that reliance will continue to grow more critical.
This is not a revelation. We believe, along with a growing number of organizations, that the current
and prevailing paradigm of accident investigation in software-rich environments is fundamentally
flawed, confused, and dangerous in the long term.
In Etsy’s corner of Internet commerce and marketplaces, we believe we can contribute to an
emerging dialogue about what “safety” is really made of: the presence of people’s expertise, not
simply the absence of accidents.
We first began practicing and developing expertise in facilitating debriefs within the Engineering
group at Etsy. Over the years, as we have evolved our understanding of this work and its value, the
greater organization (beyond the technical side) became interested in this new source of learning.
As a result, we have adapted what was originally custom-made for an engineering audience to
be a more generalized and accessible set of materials. We think this has been successful; to date,
more non-engineers than engineers have taken the course at Etsy, and some of the most insightful
debriefings have been facilitated by non-engineers.
After four years of developing and evolving the internal course, we considered that other
organizations might benefit from what we’ve put together. While we have attempted to make the
material as generalizable as possible, we do acknowledge that it has been developed on the job
and we are a company that operates an online business, which influences what we have produced
here. Nevertheless, we very much hope that other organizations (online and offline) find it useful.
Who This Guide Is for
This guide is intended to serve as a starting point for debriefing facilitators in organizations that
rely on the successful design and operation of software. It has been written with the assumption
that multiple non-technical stakeholders are involved in the dialogue around understanding and
improving the use of tools, processes, and practices in the organization.
Influences and Inspiration
As the original Code As Craft blog post (Allspaw, 2012) reveals, we have come to these ideas,
concepts, practices, and techniques through the expertise and assets of the psychology, cognitive
systems engineering, and safety science communities. The text that we use in the internal course
is The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error by Sidney Dekker. We reference a number of
passages in these texts as well:

• Working Minds: A Practitioner’s Guide to Cognitive Task Analysis, by Beth Crandall, Gary
Klein, and Robert Hoffman
Many of the techniques and approaches to interviewing and debriefing facilitation in this guide can
be seen as a specific translation of the Critical Decision Method, which is a cognitive task analysis
method designed to draw out how people make decisions; how they pick up and understand
cues in their environments; and how they judge whether their actions are likely to be fruitful or
not. Essentially, it’s a semi-structured interview approach using targeted questions, focusing
on decision making and cognition with people trying to solve problems. Scenarios are broken
down into critical junctures, and we ask questions about those. Developed by Gary Klein and his
colleagues in the late 1980s, we have found it to be an invaluable foundation for facilitators when
they approach a debriefing.
Why We Focus on Facilitation Skills
Because there are stories to uncover
A key idea in the ‘New View’ perspective is that people do (notice, pay attention, act on, solve, etc.)
what makes sense to them at the time, given their experience and familiarity with their tools, and
their understanding of the current situation.
The facilitator’s job is not to discover the things that people didn’t do, but what they actually did,
and how they perceived their world at that time.
Productive debriefing facilitation is about getting people to tell their stories. A facilitator does this
by asking pointed, open-ended questions that help to draw out descriptive details from people
that they might not otherwise say out loud. The debriefing exists to hear (and ask about) people’s
descriptions, not their explanations.
In other words: As facilitators, we are not looking for causes.

Finding cause is easy, and we don’t need a group interview to find it. In contrast, finding all the
things people actively do to keep the system running effectively is quite difficult, so an accident
provides a unique opportunity for these underlying factors to be revealed.
Because each story is essential
Like the parable of the blind men and the elephant (see below), there is no singular, omniscient
perspective on an event involving work in complex systems. There are only multiple perspectives,
sometimes overlapping and sometimes not.
The parable of the blind men and the elephant
Six blind men were asked to determine what an elephant looked like by feeling different
parts of the elephant’s body. The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar;
the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says
the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand
fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the
tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe.
None of them is wrong, but at the same time, none of the descriptions alone are sufficient
to describe an elephant holistically.
For example: In an outage or otherwise surprising scenario, it’s clear that a network engineer will
likely have a different view of the event than an engineer familiar with the application code, a
database engineer, a customer support agent, a product manager, a security engineer…the list
could go on. The facilitator’s challenge is to gather these diverse perspectives and construct an
aggregate narrative of how an event unfolded.
That being said, our goal as facilitators is not to consolidate different accounts into a unified story
of cause and effect.
It’s very tempting (and quite easy) to take the perspectives that people provide in a debriefing to
create a singular, omniscient, and comprehensive view of the accident, which we can (from our
comfortable and hindsight-driven seats) use to reveal precisely where people went wrong. However,
even if such an account could be constructed, it would be an inherently inaccurate reflection of the
complex realities in which the people existed at the time, and will continue to find themselves in as
work continues and new incidents take place.

Etsy 2016 Debriefing Facilitation Guide
As facilitators, we are not looking to somehow merge these multiple perspectives into a single story.
Quite the contrary—the value in gathering multiple narratives is to ask questions that shed light on
the contrasting and complementing parts of the different accounts shared in the debriefing.
Because everyone truly is an expert
When we ask people for descriptions of their work, we hear about their expertise. We hear about
the tips and tricks they’ve developed over their careers, like the shortcut shell aliases, special
bookmarks, one-liner scripts, and the go-to graphs they always look at when diagnosing
certain problems.
We hear about the procedures they always follow, and the ones they sometimes skip because
if they followed them blindly and to the letter they’d have a bad day, guaranteed. We hear about
what they usually do when that alert goes off and everything is fine again. When “this” and “that”
happens, they do “these things,” but only in certain circumstances. We coax out the hidden
nuances underlying their actions, decisions, and rationales.
A debriefing is where you learn how the mechanic can just lift the hood of the car, listen to that
faint hum of the engine, and intuit that it needs new valves.
A debriefing is where you discover what makes people’s work difficult, and what makes them good
at it, despite the difficulty.
The Benefit to Others: Vicarious Experiences
Expertise develops in large part from having a diverse knowledge-base to lean on when trying to
solve problems under time pressure (such as diagnosing and resolving an outage). In our domain,
this means that part of getting good at handling incidents that have a high degree of uncertainty
depends largely on how many different types of incidents you’ve been exposed to in your career.
One way to accelerate or augment training is through what Gary Klein and Robert Hoffman called
“vicarious experiences”—the shared and explored stories of perspectives (Klein, G. & Hoffman, 1993).
When we’re facilitating a debriefing, one of the primary benefits is the emergence of these “thick”
descriptions, which provide a rich source of learning for others in the company, and can help fill a
gap in their training that can’t otherwise be filled.
We know this to be true, as “war stories” told at conferences or in the hallways of successful
companies are always very compelling. The sharing of these stories is critically important, and we
tend to remember them quite well.

Etsy 2016 Debriefing Facilitation Guide
What Klein and Hoffman (and others) strongly suggest is that these descriptions in and of
themselves can serve as training materials for staff, which means that debriefing documents
should be made available, searchable, and shareable.
The question then becomes: How does a facilitator get good at eliciting these descriptions?

The Goal Is to Learn, Not to Produce Remediation Items
“The problem comes when the pressure to fix outweighs
the pressure to learn.”
—Todd Conklin, Pre-Accident Investigations
When we ask software engineers to think about how to make their environments “safer”, we cannot
be surprised that their response is to adapt existing software, or build new software.
In some cases, this can indeed help, but employees should capture the rationale for it and validate
when it’s a constructive thing to do, while being open to the idea that it might not be.
Our experience at Etsy is that identifying new tools (or modifying existing ones) to “fill in the gaps”
is one of the many outcomes from a debriefing, and perhaps not always the most important one.
In particular, it’s important to be wary of the “dashboard trap”, where the outcome of your
debriefing simply adds another graph to an ever-increasing number of graphs on yet another
dashboard someone needs to check before they can feel confident about taking an action, like
pushing code. The introduction of more input on a dashboard will ultimately make it difficult for
people to discern signal from noise (making their jobs harder), so this is an example of a superficial
solution. If you find yourself falling into the dashboard trap, take it as a sign that now’s the time to
dig deeper.
