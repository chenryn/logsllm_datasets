– Our April Twitter Feed of Outages
April2015
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass.With our new Twitter presence, we don’t
have to feel guilty. This article highlights some of the tweets that made headlines in
recentdays.

Digest Oldie but Goodie: "Active/Active Systems – A Taxonomy." Any system architecture
that is ASSC is active/active
Active/active systems are characterized by the attributes of availability, survivability, scalability, and
consistency. They eliminate planned downtime and have expected mean time between failures that
are measured in centuries. They can survive the failure of an entire data center. They are scalable
by simply adding compute resources with no impact to the users. They will consistently execute
operationsinapredictablemanneracrosstheapplicationnetwork.

FromourveryfirstDigestissue:"With100%Uptime,DoINeedaBusinessContinuityPlan?"
Extreme availabilitydoes not mean an absolute 100% uptime. Even if our calculated uptime is in the
thousands of centuries, it still means that on the average, there will be a system failure during that
interminable time. And as random events go, that failure could be tomorrow. We might not expect
another one for 10,000 years, but we had better be able to deal with tomorrow’s failure. That is why
wealwaysneedagoodBusinessContinuityPlan.
