The posting of the fourteen-minute anti-Islamic trailer “Innocence of Muslims” on YouTube in early
September, 2012, did more than spark outrage and massive anti-American demonstrations against
U.S. embassies throughout the Arab world. It launched cyberattacks against the largest American
banks in retaliation for the film. Massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks took down the
web sites of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and PNC for a day each
overatwo-weekperiod.

The Second Wave of Attacks
Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters make no secret of their plans. They announce their attacks in
advance, and the attacks have been so massive and so sophisticated that banks struggle to mitigate the
impactontheirweb-basedonlineservices.
In a posting to Pastebin.com on December 10, 2012, the attackers announced the second wave of their
hactivistcampaignonmajorU.S.banks:
“In [this] new phase, the wideness and the number of attacks will increase explicitly; and offenders
and subsequently their governmental supporters will not be able to imagine and forecast the
widespreadandgreatnessoftheseattacks.”
The hactivists threatened five major U.S. banks with DDoS attacks starting immediately - U.S. Bancorp,
JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, PNC Financial Services Group, and SunTrust Bank. Each of these
banks had suffered major DDoS attacks during Phase 1 of the group’s campaign from mid-September to
mid-October along with five other banks – Wells Fargo, Regions Bank, HSBC, BB&T, and Capital One.
Duringthatcampaign, eachinstitution was warned ahead of time;andnone were ableto completelyfend
offtheattacks.

Thesecondwaveoftheattackscontinueonanevenbroaderscopethantheoriginalattacks.Uptoseven
banks a day are targeted, but interestingly only on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. The attacks
arenowintheirsixthweek.
On December 12th, FS-ISAC (Financial Services – Information Sharing and Analysis Center),2 a
government-mandated organization set up to warn banks of impending cyber- and physical attacks,
issuedamemberadvisoryoutliningprecautionstotake.3Inpart,theadvisorystated:
“Targeted institutions have been working together with members of the security community and with
government partners to help defend against the attacks. Information pertaining to tactics and
techniques has been shared among these parties and with the broader FS-ISAC membership. FS-
ISAChasprovidedbestpracticestoitsmemberstomitigateriskfromthesetypesofattacks.
“Financial institutions should ensure they have reviewed their Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
detection and mitigation plans as well as recent threat intelligence shared by and through the FS-
ISAC.
“FS-ISAC is working with its members, its partners, and government agencies to monitor this threat,
shareinformation,andsupportmembersunderattack.”
The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters have repeated their vow to continue attacks until the U.S.
removestheoffensivevideofromtheInternet:
“The implementing of these attacks is because of the widespread and organized offends to Islamic
spirituals and holy issues. If this offended film is going to be eliminated from the Internet, the
belongingattacksalsowillbestopped.”
Is Iran Involved?
No one knows. According to a report by the New York Times, Iran is to blame for the DDoS attacks
against U.S. Banks. The conjecture of some government and security theorists is that the attacks are in
retaliation for the Stuxnet attack presumably launched against Iran by the United States and Israel to
destroyIran’scentrifugesthatarebeingusedtorefineuranium.4
However, there is no conclusive proof that Iran is involved. The Iranian government has officially denied
anyinvolvementintheattacks,andissuedthefollowingstatement:
“Unlike the United States, which has, per reports in the media, given itself the license to engage in
illegal cyber-warfare against Iran, Iran respects the international law and refrains from targeting other
nations’economicorfinancialinstitutions.”
The Increasing Attack Sophistication
The bank DDoS attacks have been massive. The well-publicized Anonymous attacks on companies
supporting Internet censorship via the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) flooded web sites with one
gigabyte/secondoftraffic.Therecentbankattackshavemeasured70Gbpsandmore.

When the bank attacks first began, initial reports indicated that a massive botnet had been organized by
the hacktivists by getting hundreds of thousands of enraged users to volunteer their PCs as part of the
botnet.Thisprovidedthecapacitytofloodbankingwebsiteswithsuchamassoftraffic.
New information now has surfaced that the attacks are even more sophisticated. It is not only volunteer
PCs that are being used. Compromised data-center web servers are being turned into DDoS weapons.
These servers have a great deal more networking and compute capacity than PCs and can generate a
great deal more malicious traffic. To generate 70 Gbps of DDoS traffic requires 70,000 PCs, each with a
1 Mbps connection. Ten times this number of PCs might be required if many of the PCs are in
underdeveloped countries with limited bandwidth resources. Only 70 servers with 1 Gbps of bandwidth
capacityeachareneededtogeneratethesameamountoftraffic.
Evenworse,webserversareasourceoflegitimateIPaddressesandtypicallyhaveatrustedrelationship
with their endpoints. Malicious traffic looks like legitimate internal traffic, allowing it to bypass security
mechanismsandmakingitdifficulttouseanti-spoofingmechanismstoblockjunktraffic.

In one such case, the administrative user name and password were “admin,” “admin.” The administrator
hadnotbeenconcernedaboutsecuritybecause“therewasnothingonhiswebsiteworthstealing!”
The attackers hijacking web servers use a backdoor to leverage the server’s PHP environment to inject
dynamic attack code that allows the attacker to quickly adapt to any changes in the web site’s security
facilities.Usingservers insteadof PCs,theattacks arefarmoresophisticated.Theyattack avictim’s web
serveratseverallevels:
 Network level: The network is bombarded with traffic, consuming all the bandwidth needed by
legitimate incoming requests. Such an attack can be as simple as sending massive numbers of
pings to the web site or as sophisticated as an amplified DNS attack, in which UDP queries
requiring large responses are sent to the web site’s DNS server. In these cases, the source IP
addresscanbespoofed;sothereisnoindicationofthesourceoftherequests.
 Infrastructure level: Network devices such as firewalls, routers, and switches are usually stateful.
They maintain state in internal tables. If their state tables fill, they can handle no further traffic.
DDoS attacks at the infrastructure level attempt to fill the state tables of network devices so that
theyareboggeddownandcannothandleanymorelegitimatetraffic.
 Application level: The web server applications are targeted. A simple example of this a mass of
login requests. The requests do not have to be successful – they just have to consume server
resources as thelogin is processedandrejected.If an attacker has managed to obtain legitimate
login names and passwords, it can do even more damage byinvoking application functions such
assearchesthatrequireagreatdealofprocessingcapacity.
One concern for the future is hacked clouds. If an attacker can create a malicious virtual machine in a

What to Do?
Banking web sites are more susceptible to DDoS attacks than non-banking e-commerce sites because
their additional levels of security for authentication, transaction verification, and device identification
requiremorebandwidth.Accordingtosecurityexperts,banksneedtoaddressthreekeyareas:
 Layereduseofauthenticationatlogin,whichconsumesbandwidth.

 RelianceonInternetserviceprovidersnotequippedtohandleextremebandwidthdemands.
 Internal management of web servers to allow a bank to hand off traffic overflow when volumes
areexcessive.
Theseexpertsnotethatdefensesinclude:
 using appropriate technology, including cloud-based services, to handle overflow when high
volumesofwebtrafficstrike.
 assessingtheir exposureto DDoSattacks bytestingtheir systems withtraffic volumes thatmimic
real-worldattacks.
 implementingonlineoutagemitigationandresponsestrategiesbeforeanattackhits.
 training staff to recognize the signs of a DDoS attack so thatmitigation strategies can be invoked
assoonaspossible.
 coordinating with ISPs and other service providers to implement traffic controls such as
scrubbing,rate-limiting,andsource-blocking.
A cautionarynote: DDoS attacks are frequently used as tools of distraction to mask fraud attempts in the
background. If a DDoS attack occurs, the awareness of malicious intrusion attempts should be
heightened.
The bottom line is that disruptive DDoS attacks will persist. A bank’s business-continuity plan must take
this intoaccount anddefine howonlinecustomer services willcontinueintheeventthatthebank’s online
bankingservicesareseriouslydegradedorinterruptedbysuchanattack.
An important aspect of the plan is communication with the bank’s customers to let them know that a
suspected attack is underway and what to do in the interim. Initially, some banks posted information
aboutanattack onsocialmedia.Other banks deniedthatanattack was inprogress orsaidonlythattheir
siteswereexperiencingintermittentoutages.Banksarenowrealizingthatalthoughcustomersmustknow
what is going on and what they should do, exposing this information to the general public only
encourages the attackers by letting them know of their successes. Banks now have taken to targeted
emailingtotheircustomersforthispurpose.
Summary
Based on current experience, there is no absolute defense against DDoS attacks. Attackers seem to be
growing sophisticated more quickly than new, effective defenses can be deployed. Any online server,
regardless of its sophistication, can be overwhelmed with enough traffic; and a dedicated attacker can
generatewhateveramountofmalicioustrafficisrequiredtoachieveitsgoals.
Thegoodnews is thatmitigationefforts areindicating someresults.Banks,ISPs, cloud-basedprevention
providers, and security vendors have all increased their efforts. The result is that the number of DDoS
attacks against banks has become less frequent. Attacks are lasting for a shorter period of time and are
causinglessdamage.
In addition, the U.S. National Security Agency is now cooperating with the financial services industry to
help mitigate the impact of DDoS attacks. This effort underscores the government’s concern about these
unprecedentedassaults.
