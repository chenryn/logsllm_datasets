History’s Largest DDoS Attack?
April2013
From March 18th through March 28th, Spamhaus, a spam-filtering site, was swamped with up to 300
gigabits per second (gbps) of traffic in the largest reported Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack in
thehistoryoftheInternet.Howwasthisamountoftrafficgenerated?
The answer is that a well-known flaw in DNS servers known as open resolvers was used to generate the
massive amount of malicious traffic. Spamhaus survived the attack by enlisting the services of a DDoS
protectionvendorthatspreadthetrafficoverits23worldwidedatacenters.
Spamhaus
Spamhaus is a Swiss/British anti-spam watchdog group. It is a nonprofit organization run by volunteers,
and it works alongside law enforcement agencies such as the FBI (the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation),emailproviders,andnetworksaroundtheworld.
Spamhaus provides a blacklist of IP addresses for servers that are determined by Spamhaus to host
email spammers.The list is updated in real time and is provided to ISPs, corporations, and spam-filtering
vendors. The lists are typically used by the DNS servers of these organizations to restrict incoming
informationfromspammingsites.
Itis estimatedthat1.4billionInternetusers are protectedbytheSpamhaus blacklist.Thismeans that 1.4
billion users cannot receive anything from a listed site. Though Spamhaus provides a procedure for a
listedsitetoclearitsnameandberemovedfromthelist,itisunderstandablethatthemanagementofany

The Attack by CyberBunker
CyberBunker
CyberBunker, named for its headquarters in an old NATO five-story bunker, is a Dutch web site that
claims that it will host anything but child pornography and terrorism-related content. The CyberBunker

The owner of CyberBunker is Sven Olaf Kamphuis. He calls himself the “Minister of telecommunications

TheInitialAttack
The attacks on Spamhaus began on March 18, 2013. In the beginning, they were rather weak and had
little effect on Spamhaus’ operations. The attacks started out with a data rate of 10 gbps. Spamhaus’

The attacks then escalated to 75 gbps on March 19th. This level of attack became a serious threat to
Spamhaus. Its web site was substantially unreachable, and it could not update its lists. It reached out to
CloudFlare,anInternetsecurityfirm,forhelpweatheringtheattack.
CloudFlaretotheRescue
Headquartered in Silicon Valley, CloudFlare is an Internet security firm that maintains 23 data centers
around the world. It spread the Spamhaus attack among its data centers, allowing Spamhaus services to
resume.
CyberBunker immediately included CloudFlare in its attack, and the DDoS data rate increased to an
unprecedented 300 gbps. CloudFlare also was able to distribute this level of DDoS attack among its data
centerswithoutaffectingitsothercustomers,andSpamhauscontinuedinoperation.

TheInternetis acollection of networks(thus its name) allconnectedtogether usingpeeringrelationships.
Company intranets connect to Tier 2 networks that purchase bandwidth from Tier 1 networks. Tier 1
networks include such companies as AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and Deutsche Telekom and provide their

CyberBunker began attacking the upstream peers and exchanges used by Spamhaus and CloudFlare.
This included their Tier 2 providers, the Tier 1 providers to which the Tier 2 providers were connected,
andtheassociatedInternetExchanges.TheLondonIX(LINX),Amsterdam IX(AMS-IX),GermanIX(DE-
CIX), and Hong Kong IX (HKIX) were all attacked. Every network attached to an attacked IX was also
affected.

Most of the Internet that was impacted was in Europe. Some estimated that hundreds of millions of
people were affected, though others noted that there did not seem to be any uproar over Internet

The attacks finally stopped (at least for now) on March 28th. They had been going on for almost two
weeks.
How Significant is 300 gbps?

recent attack on U.S. online banking portals in retaliation for the YouTube video “Innocence of Muslims”
reachedanunprecedentedrateatthattimeof70gbps.1
The Spamhaus attack was the first reported DDoS attack of such a magnitude. In fact, the data rate may
well have exceeded 300 gbps – this was the upper limit of the measurement capability of CloudFlare’s
instrumentation.
The Net Effect
The distributed-processing resources that Spamhaus and CloudFlare were able to deploy helped to
reduce the impact on them. Spamhaus continued to distribute its black list, and CloudFlare continued to
serviceitsothercustomers.
There were certainly ripples of disruption in Europe as servers moved mountains of junk traffic over the
Internet. However, the impact maynot have been as great on other Internet users as CloudFlare publicly
indicated. Gizmodo claimed that CloudFlare was exaggerating the impact on the Internet in order to sell
its DDoS services. CloudFlare countered that since some IX IP addresses are well known, successful
attackscanbelaunched.Theseattacksareawarningforthefuture.
The DNS Flaw – Open Resolvers

Theattacks onU.S.banksincreasedthis dataratebyanorder ofmagnitude.Theattackersachievedthis
by two means. First, they used a network of PCs provided by volunteers – all those equally infuriated by
the YouTube video. This was a massive number of PCs – far more than a normal infected botnet would
provide. Second, they were able to infect servers and put them into service. A large server can generate

The use of these open resolvers to generate a massive amount of malicious traffic is straightforward. It is
calledDNSreflection.TheattackersendsarequesttoanopenresolverforinformationconcerningaURL
address. The open resolver DNS server responds with data concerning that destination. However, the
attackerhasspoofedtherequestingaddresstobethatofitsvictim.Thus,theDNSinformationisreturned
tothevictim.
This is likemailing information to thousands of companies with the victim’s return address on the back of
the envelope. The result is that when the organizations reply, the victim is swamped with a landslide of
uselessdata.
The success of a reflection attack depends upon the relative size of the request message and that of the
responsemessage.A typicalDNSrequestmessageis about 30 bytes.A typical DNSresponsemessage
contains about 3,000 bytes – a 100:1 amplification factor. Thus, to generate 300 gbps of DDoS data, the
attackeronlyneedstogenerate3gbps–afairlytrivialdatarate.
The Future of DDoS Attacks
WhatCanWeExpect?
Lists of DNS open resolvers have been passed around the Internet on network security lists for the last
few years to help administrators identify and correct them.The Spamhaus attack is the first time that this
flaw has been used for a major attack, and it is the first time that the full extent of the problem has been
madepublic.WenowcanexpectotherhackerstoutilizethissameDNSflawtolaunchmajorattacks.
Could one day a nation-state or a terrorist group cripple the entire worldwide Internet using a DNS
reflection DDoS technique? Devastation of an unprecedented scale might result. Let’s hope that we can
acttoclosethissecurityholebeforewehavetofacesuchasituation.
WhatCanWeDo?
The first thing we can do to solve the problem is to get rid of all of the DNS open resolvers. The Open
Resolver Project has been set up to identify the remaining open resolvers (27 million of them so far) and
to prepare procedures for system administrators to modify their DNS servers to eliminate the flaw.
Unfortunately,littleincentiveexistsforadministratorstoaddthistasktotheirbusyworkload.
Until the open resolvers are secured, a company can take some steps to help mitigate the impact of an
attack:
 It can ensure that it has sufficient redundant Internet connections to be able to route traffic in the
middleofamajorDDoSattack.
 It can subscribe to a DDoS protection service such as CloudFlare (there are many others) that
canspreadthemalicioustrafficacrossmultipledatacenterstominimizeitsimpact.
 It can contract with content-delivery networks to provide a degree of protection from DDoS
attacksbyusingtheirlargedistributedserverinfrastructurestoabsorbtraffic.
 It can implement the provisions of BCP 38 for its network. This Internet specification allows only
traffic thatoriginatedina network tobe sent out of the network.Consequently, sender addresses
cannotbespoofed(atleast,nottoaddressesoutofnetwork).

Summary
Gonearethedays whenamajordata-centerfailurefollowedbyafailoverfaulttoanotherdatacenterwas
the only way to lose all IT services. DDoS attacks now can have the same impact. However, recovery
time is not a matter of minutes or hours as backups are brought up. Rather, recovery time is up to the
attacker.
Companies must now take into account this type of data-center failure, and the Business Continuity Plan
must deal with the continuation of services when system response times have become so long that IT is
unabletosupportthecompany’soperations.
