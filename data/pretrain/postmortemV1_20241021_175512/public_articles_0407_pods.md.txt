Data Center in a Box
July2009
Gone may be the days of elaborate data centers in campus
surroundings. Tomorrow’s data centers may be stacked in
boxes in the parking lot. Boxes? Well, cargo shipping
containers,tobeexact.Thekindyouseestackeduponhuge
freightersplyingtheoceans.
Google,thepioneer insomanythings IT,startedthis trendin
2005. After some derision, its data-center packaging
practices are now being followed bysuch industry leaders as
HP,Sun,IBM,Dell,andMicrosoft.
Why Would Anyone Want to Put a Data Center into a Shipping Container?
Therearelotsofreasons.Theyboildowntomobility,cost,schedule,andenergyefficiency.
 If acompany’s datacenter is disabledbysomedisaster,andif theyhaveno backupdata

 If a data center runs out of capacity while its new facilities are being constructed, the
company can add additional capacity with a mobile data center. Maybe it doesn’t need

A containerized data center can be wheeled in and needs only three connections – power, water
(for cooling), and networks. Ideally, it should have a concrete pad to rest on and a roof over its
head;butthesearenotabsolutelynecessary.
Google, the Pioneer
Google began the containerization trend in 2005 when it started to deploy new data centers in
containers. It had already developed its own line of DC-powered servers, each with its own
backup battery to replace the less-efficient UPS (uninterrupted power supply) systems typically

used in data centers. To achieve even more space and energy efficiency, it conceived the
containerizeddatacenter.
A Google container can house 1,160 of Google’s dual-processor x86 servers. A container

The energy efficiency of a data center (and other big power users) is measured by the Power
Usage Effectiveness (PUE), which is a measure of how much additional power is needed over
the basic power required to run the facility. A PUE of 1.5 means that the facility draws 50% more
power than its basic needs, this additional power being used for lighting, cooling, and other
peripheral uses. Typical PUEs for today’s data centers are 2.0 to 3.0 – the data center requires

the other hand, has achieved a PUE of 1.12, which meets the EPA (U.S. Environmental
ProtectionAgency)goalssetfor2011.
HP’sPOD–thePerformanceOptimizedDatacenter
HP has announced its containerized data center, the Performance
Optimized Datacenter, or POD (www.hp.com/go/pod) and gave
walk-through tours of the POD at its recent HPTF (HP Technology
Forum) 2009 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S.A. The POD
is a 40 x 8 foot shipping container packed full with data center
equipment. A 20-foot version is reported to be in the works for the
fourthquarterof2009.
Within the POD are twenty-two 19-inch standard 50U racks
providing 1,100U of rack space. The racks can hold up to 160
servers each for a POD total of 3,520 servers. Being standard
racks, any vendor’s equipment designed for these racks may be
used, including servers from IBM, Dell, and Sun and networking
gear from Cisco. Alternatively, a POD can be configured with up to
12,000 hard drives, providing total storage of 12,000 petabytes.
Any combination of servers, storage, and network equipment may

Each rack can provide up to 27 KW of power for a POD total of 670 KW and will operate with
externalambienttemperaturesrangingfrom-20ºto+120ºFahrenheit.
The cooling efficiency of the POD derives from its compact nature. The tall 50U racks form a
barrierfromfloortoceiling.Theaisleinfrontoftheracksisthe“coldaisle.”Thespacebehindthe
racks is the “hot aisle.” Cold air is
blown into the cold aisle from
overhead blowers. From there, it flows
through the rack-mounted equipment
tothehotaisleintherearoftheracks,
where it rises and enters water-cooled
heat exchangers mounted above the
racks. The cold air emerging from the
heat exchangers is blown back down
into the cold aisle. Because of the
cooling efficiency of this system,
cooling water need only be at a
temperature of 65º F rather than the
45º F water temperature normally
required, leading to further
efficiencies.
ThePODExposed
The term “cold aisle” is relative. This is the aisle that operations personnel use for frontal access
to the equipment. HP recommends that the cold aisle be maintained at a temperature of 90º F.
However, for operator comfort, the temperature may be maintained at any lower temperature at

HPclaimsthattheirpodscanbestackedbutnomorethantwohigh.
The flexibility of the POD lies in the claim by HP that they can deliver a fully configured and
functional POD within six weeks from date of order. This compares favorably with the one-to-two
years required to build or extend a data-center facility. If unexpected increases in data center

Rackable’s ICE Cube
Rackable System’s ICE Cube (www.rackable.com)
comes in a 20-foot or a 40-foot shipping container
designed to house its half-depth server rack systems.
As such, it is not compatible with equipment from other
manufacturers. However, because of the half-depth
form factor of Rackable servers, ICE Cube provides
significantlymorerackspace.

Arranged in two rows with a 3-foot center aisle, a forty-foot ICE Cube provides 1,540U of rack
space. Mounted in these racks can be servers containing 22,400 cores (Intel Xeon quad-core
processors)or11.8petabytesofstorage.
Rackable claims a PUE less than 1.2. An ICE Cube can be delivered with no external logo for
security.
