Sidekick: Your Data is in ‘Danger’
November2009
Sidekick, a popular smart phone provided by Microsoft and marketed by T-Mobile, suffered an
outage in early October, 2009, that threatened to wipe out all of the data of its one million
worldwide subscribers. Gone were contact lists, photos, calendars, and to-do lists. After initially
announcing that all data had been lost, Microsoft then held out hope that some of it could be
recovered.ThejuryisstilloutonhowsuccessfulMicrosoftwillbe.
Howcouldthishavehappened?EspeciallytoMicrosoft?
Sidekick and Danger
Sidekick is one of the original smartphones.Itis the creation of acompanyaptlynamedDanger,
started by a team of Apple veterans in January, 2000. Danger called its original smart phone
“Hiptop.”
Hiptop supported all of the expected smart phone services, including web browsing, instant
messaging, games, multimedia, social networking, web e-mail, personal information
management, and downloadable software applications. As part of the Hiptop service, Danger set
up a server complex - its Service Delivery Engine - to store all of its subscribers’ data. This
included subscribers’ address books, calendars, photos, and to-do lists, as well as email
messages.
By doing this, if a subscriber lost his phone, its contents could be easily restored to a new one.
Also, if a phone shut down improperly or encountered any corruption of data, Danger could
replacetheentiredatasetinthephonewithacorrectcopy.
Microsoft Acquires Sidekick
In early 2008, Microsoft announced its acquisition of Danger and the Hiptop product, apparently
in an attempt to shore up its sagging mobile operating system. At the time, Danger had revenues
of $56 million and 1.2 million subscribers supported by a staff of 300. Though the purchase price
wasnotannounced,speculationisthatitlayintherangeof$100millionto$500million.
MicrosoftrebrandedtheHiptopsmartphoneas“Sidekick.”
T-Mobile and Sidekick
From its earlier days, Hiptop, and now Sidekick, has been marketed by T-Mobile as its smart-
phone service. T-Mobile now relies on Microsoft for the backend operations of the Sidekick
service.

Sidekick
The Sidekick smart phone stores subscriber data in its local
RAM. Since the amount of this data can easily exceed the
phone’s memory capacity, especially with photos, the Sidekick
servicestoreseachsubscriber’sdatainitscentraldatacenter.
Should the phone be turned off and its local data be lost, the
phone will resynchronize with the central database when it is
next turned on. The Sidekick phones are clients to the central
data center’s servers and can request not only a database
refresh but any piece of data, such as a photo, that the
subscriberrequests.
Microsoft’s central Sidekick server complex is the original
Danger system. Microsoft inherited this system and elected not
to overhaul it. It is reported to run on Sun Linux servers
organizedasaclusterwithanOracleRACdatabase.
Of note is that Sidekick did not provide a means for subscribers
to back up their data locally. Subscribers were totallydependent
upon being able to retrieve their data from the central servers. In contrast, smartphones such as
Apple’siPhoneallowsubscriberstobackuptheirdatatoalocalPC.
The Data-Loss Disaster
TheOutage
On Thursday, October 1, 2009, Sidekick subscribers around the world lost all data functionality.
Though the Sidekicks still functioned as mobile phones, all access to address books, calendars,
photos,andotherdatawasgone.
Shortly thereafter, users started reporting in a variety of blogs and on Twitter that their Sidekicks
were wiped of all personal information. The worst possible outcome was confirmed on Saturday,
October10th,whenT-MobileandMicrosoftannouncedthatalldatastoredfortheSidekickservice
waslikelylost.T-Mobile’sstatementsaidinpart:
“Regrettably, based on Microsoft/Danger’s latest recovery assessment of their systems, we
must now inform you that personal information stored on our device – such as contacts,
calendarentries,to-dolistsorphotos–thatisnolongeronyourSidekickalmostcertainlyhas
been lost as a result of a server failure at Microsoft/Danger. That said, our teams continue to
work around-the-clock in hopes of discovering some way to recover this information,
However,thelikelihoodofasuccessfuloutcomeisextremelylow.”
T-Mobile offered tips to preserve whatever data was still stored in the phones – don’t turn them
off, don’t let the batteries run down, don’t remove the batteries. In other words, keep the phone’s
RAM powered up so that any data that was stored in the phone would remain there until the
serverswererestored.

errorsfromaserverfailurethathurtitsmainandbackupdatabasessupportingSidekickusers.
This problem wasn’t caused by T-Mobile. T-Mobile was let down by its partner, Microsoft. But it
was certainly T-Mobile’s problem to manage. In response to the magnitude of the outage, T-
Mobile suspended sales of both of its current models of Sidekick and offered to allow customers
to withdraw from their contracts. It also offered a free month of data service (with a typical value
of$20).
This wasn’t enough to ward off the inevitable. On October 14th, a class action lawsuit was
launchedagainstMicrosoftandT-mobile.Thelawsuitalleged:
"T-Mobile and Microsoft promised to safeguard the most important data their customers
possess and then apparently failed to follow even the most basic data protection principles.
Whattheydidisunthinkableinthisdayandage."
Wellsaid.
TheRecovery?
Surprisingly, a few Sidekick users started to report that their personal data, feared lost forever,
appeared to be restored. On Thursday, October 15, Microsoft was confident enough to claim that
ithadrecoveredmost,ifnotall,ofthedataandthatmostSidekick subscriberswould,infact,see
theirdatarecovered
However, a few days later, Microsoft retreated from that position. On Monday, October 19,
Microsoft released a sobering statement that said “The Danger/Microsoft team is continuing to
work around the clock on the data restoration process.We apologize that thisis taking solong, but
we want to make sure we are doing everything possible to maintain the integrity of your data. We
continue to make steady progress, and we hope to be able to begin restoring personal contacts
for affected users this week, with the remainder of the content (photographs, notes, to-do lists,
marketplacedata,andhighscores)shortlythereafter.”

How Did It Happen?
There has not been any statement yet by Microsoft describing the cause of the problem. There
has, though, been much speculation in the press about what the problem was. The current
speculation is that an upgrade to their storage area network was undertaken without a proper
backup,andtheupgradewentwrongandwipedouttheonlineprimaryandbackupdatabases.
Evidently, Hitachi Data Systems was chosen to execute the SAN upgrade. On October 12, T-
Mobilestatedthat““HitachiDataSystemsisinvestigatingthecauseoftheproblem,whichhasnot
beenidentifiedatthistime.”
OnOctober15,alongwithitsoptimisticpronouncementoffulldatarecovery,Microsoftsaidthata
computer system failure caused the loss of data both in a core Sidekick database and in a
backup database. It said that it has made changes to improve the Sidekick service’s stabilityand

Industryexpertshaveguessedthattheproblem wasnotHitachi’s,butratheraSuncluster/Oracle
RAC problem. The Oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters) database allows computers in a
clustertosimultaneouslyaccessacommondatabase.
As reported in The Register,1 the Danger Service Delivery Engine comprises about twenty
CentOS Linux servers and eight or more Sun SPARC and x86 servers running Solaris. Oracle
RACisusedastheclusterdatabasefortheSunservercluster.
The outage appeared to be a Sun server failure that was followed by the inability to access user
data in the Oracle database and its backup. The Oracle RAC database was fed garbage by the
Sun servers and was corrupted during the update process. It seems apparent, though, that the
datawasnotactuallydeleted;itjustcouldn’tbefounduntilthesystemwasrebuiltandaccesstoit
regained
Whenaskedaboutthisconjecture,Microsoft’sonlyresponsewasnoncommittal:
“Sidekick runs on Danger’s proprietary service that Microsoft inherited when it acquired
Danger in 2008. The Danger service is built on a mix of Danger created technologies and
3rd party technologies. Microsoft’s other cloud computing projects are totally separate from
theDangerServiceanddonotrelyontheDangerServicetechnology.”
Interestingly,twomonthspreviously,Microsoft’sDangersubsidiarypostedajobadreading:
“A keypriorityis automating reliable reporting log file transfer and database load functionality
– existing environment has fragile software and is unreliable, requiring manual DB cleanup
andre-runofdataloads,retrievingmissingfiles,etc.”
Microsoft says that it is rebuilding the Danger Service Delivery Engine piece-by-piece and is
recovering more data at each step. This appears to be behind its hope to recover most or all of
thelostsubscriberdata.
Microsoft Has Plenty of Company
This wasn’t the first time that Sidekick made the news. In 2005, Paris Hilton’s Sidekick was
hackedanditscontentspostedontheInternet.
More to the point, Nokia’s Ovi smart phone service suffered a similar outage in February, 2008,

Indeed, other cloud providers have also had news-worthy outages, including Google, Twitter,
PayPal,Rackspace,WindowsAzure,Salesforce,andAmazonS3.3
Lessons Learned
The main lesson to be learned by the Sidekick experience is one that has been voiced over and
over inthepress,includingtheAvailability Digest.If youaregoingtostore your datainthecloud,
back it up independently. This best practice extends beyond smart phone data – it must be done
foranydatayoustoreinthecloud.
Appropriatebackupmeansinclude your ownPC or server,externalharddisks,andevenanother
independentcloud.
An interesting and powerful step has been taken in this direction by Amazon and its cloud
services. It has established Availability Zones that provide geographically-separated redundancy
for its cloud services.4 A customer can select an Availability Zone to launch an instance of his
application. He can also launch a backup instance in another Availability Zone. One of these
instances is the primaryinstance. The database in the backup instance is kept synchronized with
theprimarydatadatabaseviadatareplication.
Perhaps cloud services will someday warrant the trust of your data. Until then, make sure that
youkeepyourowncopy.
