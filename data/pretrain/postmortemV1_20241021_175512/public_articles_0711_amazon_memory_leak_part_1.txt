Amazon Downed by Memory Leak
November2012
On Monday, October 22, 2012, Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a major multi-hour outage in one
of its Northeastern Availability Zones. The outage took down several customers, including Reddit,
Pinterest,Foursquare,Minecraft,Heroku,GitHub,imgur,Pocket,HipChat,Coursers,Airbnb,andothers.
TheproblembeganinanoncriticalprogramthathadnosignificantroleintheongoingoperationsofAWS.
It was a memory leak whose impact cascaded unnoticed over several hours to critical components and
finallydisabledmostofanentireAvailabilityZone.
The series of faults that were invoked by a single innocuous memory leak are so complex that it first
requiresanunderstandingoftheAWSarchitecture.
The AWS Architecture
We have described the AWS architecture in some detail in our earlier article, entitled “Amazon’s
AvailabilityZones.”1Wesummarizethatdescriptionhere.
TheAWSCloud
Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a suite of IT infrastructure resources that can be used by
businesses to implement their applications. The processing, storage, and network capacity provided by
the AWS services can expand and contract as the application’s needs change. A customer pays only for
whathisapplicationsuse.Amazon’sretailservicerunsintheAmazoncloud.
AWSServices
TheprimaryAWSservicesinclude:
 AvailabilityZones–fault-isolatedvirtualdatacenterswithinaregionaldatacenter.
 ElasticComputeCloud(EC2)–providesresizablecompute,storage,andnetwork
capacity.
 ElasticIPAddresses(EIP)–staticIPaddressesthatcanbemigratedbetweenEC2
instances.
 SimpleStorageService(S3)–storesandretrievesdataviaasimplewebinterface
(URLs).
 ElasticBlockStore(EBS)–providespersistentstorageforanEC2instance.
 RelationalDatabaseService(RDS)–scalableMySQLandOracledatabasesupport.

Below, we describe the AWS services that make up the Amazon cloud and how they interoperate to
providehighavailabilityofcloud-basedapplications.
AvailabilityZones(AZ)
For criticalapplications that justcannot go down, it is imperative torun instances of the application in two
or moregeographicallyseparated datacenters so that the application survives anydestructive event.For
this purpose, Amazon operates data centers in multiple regions throughout the world. Within each region
are multiple fault-isolated Availability Zones. Amazon’s Availability Zones are a major move towards
achievinghighavailabilityinthecloud.
AvailabilityZones are distinctlocations within aregion that areengineeredtobe insulatedfrom failures in
other Availability Zones and that provide inexpensive, low latency connectivity to other Availability Zones
in the same region. An AvailabilityZone (AZ) is in effect a separate data center in a region. It has its own
power, cooling, and communication infrastructure that is separate from the other Availability Zones in its
region.Therefore,afailureofoneAZ willnotaffectanotherAZexceptforaregionaldisaster.
An AZ is not necessarily in a different data center from the other AZs. It is only necessary that the data
centerbebuilttoensuretheindependenceoftheAZs.
A customer can run critical applications in two AZs, with one instance handling the production workload
andtheotherstandingbyinordertotakeovershouldtheproductionapplicationinstancefail.
ElasticComputeCloud(EC2)
The Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is the primary infrastructure for the Amazon cloud, providing resizable
compute facilities. The fundamental building block of the Elastic Compute Cloud is an EC2 instance. An
EC2instanceisanapplicationrunningintheAWScloudasavirtualmachine(VM).
To provide fault recovery, multiple EC2 instances of an application can be run in the same or different
AvailabilityZonesorregions.
ElasticIPAddresses(EIP)
An Elastic IP Address (EIP) is anIPaddress thatcan beassigned toanEC2 instance.However,unlikea
static address,itcaneasilybemigratedto another instance.WhenanEC2 instanceis created, itis given
an EIP address. All traffic routed to that EIP address then goes to the instance to which the EIP address
is assigned. If the EIP address is reassigned to another EC2 instance, all further traffic will be routed to
thenewinstance.
EIP addressing brings a significant availability advantage to EC2 in that it provides a simple mechanism
toreroutetraffic toabackupEC2instanceshouldthe primaryinstancefail.Allthatneeds tobedoneis to
issueacommandtopointtheEIPaddresstothenewinstancethatshouldtakeoverprocessing.
SimpleStorageSystem(S3)
TheSimpleStorageSystem(S3)providesstorageservicesthatcanbeusedtostoreanyamountofdata.
Data is stored in buckets. A bucket contains multiple data objects, typically files. A data object’s size can
beanywherefromonebyteto5GB.
A bucket can be stored in any region. It is accessed over the Internet and is identified by a unique URL
specifiedbytheuser.Objectswithinthebucketarespecifiedbyuserdefinedkeys.

Up to six replicas of an S3 bucket can be maintained across multiple AZs in different regions. S3 storage
has highaccess latencysinceitis accessed over theInternet.Therefore,itis not suitablefor applications
thatrequirehighperformance.
ElasticBlockStore(EBS)
The Elastic Block Store (EBS) is persistent block-level storage. An EBS volume can be sized from 1 GB
to 1 TB. It can be mounted by any EC2 instance (just one EC2 instance at a time) and can be used just
as any block storage device. Typically, a database management system is run in an EC2 instance that
usesEBSforitsunderlyingstorage.
EBSis designedto behighlyavailable. AlogicalEBS volumeis synchronouslyreplicatedtomultipleEBS
physicalvolumesinthesameAZ.Oneofthephysicalvolumesistheprimaryvolumeandis theoneused
bythe EC2 instance that has it mounted. The other volumes are used onlyfor redundancyto ensure that
data is not lost due to a volume failure. If a volume should fail (primary or backup), EBS searches the
physical volumes to find one with enough space to use as a replacement redundant volume. It then
makes a copy of the logical volume onto the new physical volume. This is called remirroring. During
remirroring,thelogicalvolumeisnotaccessible.Applications attemptingtousethis volumearesaidtobe
“stuck.”
AnEC2instancecanmountseveral logicalEBSvolumes.BackupEBSlogicalvolumescanbecreatedin
other AvailabilityZones and kept synchronized with the primary volume using synchronous replication. In
this way, if the primaryAZ should fail, a new EC2 instance can be rapidly created in another AZ and can
mount the backup volume. As soon as the Elastic IP address is redirected and remirroring is completed,

AvailabilityZones.ItdetectsunhealthyEC2instancesandceasestoroutetraffictothem.
