OpenStack – The Open Cloud
April2012
As expressed by Tom O’Reilly, “If cloud computing is the future, then understanding how to make that
futureopenisoneofthegreattechnologychallengesofourday.”
Major clouds are now forming. There is Amazon Web Services, Google Apps, Microsoft Azure,
RackspaceCloud,andForce.com,amongothers.Manycompanies arelookingseriouslyatmovingsome
of their applications to a cloud. Clouds provide many advantages – rapid provisioning for applications
without capital expenditures, elastic resourcing depending upon an application’s immediate needs, and a
pay-as-you-gobusinessmodel.
However, moving an application to a cloud is certain lock-in. Clouds are simply incompatible with each
other. Choosing a cloud is like choosing an IBM or a Burroughs mainframe decades ago. Once you are
upandrunning,youareownedbythevendor.
Thereisclearlyanadvantagetohavingcommoncloudstandards.Acompanycouldadaptitsapplications
to the cloud and run them on the cloud of its choice. If it becomes disenchanted with its cloud provider, it
can simply move to another cloud as easily as moving a Java application to another platform. It could
backup its applications in another cloud in case its cloud-of-choice goes down. And yes, there have been
manydisastrousfailuresoftoday’sclouds.1
OpenStack is a major initiative to achieve this goal. On its web site, http://openstack.org, OpenStack
declares that it is “a large scale open source cloud project and community established to drive industry
standards, end cloud lock-in and speed the adoption of cloud technologies by service providers and
enterprises.” OpenStack allows service providers, enterprises, and government agencies to build
massivelyscalablepublicandprivateclubsusingfreelyavailableApache-licensedsoftware.
Rackspace and NASA are OpenStack’s key initial founders. They contributed the initial code to
OpenStackfrom theircloudplatforms.OpenStack iscurrentlysupportedbyover150companiesincluding
HP,Citrix,Intel,AMD,SUSELinux,Microsoft,Cisco,Dell,andCanonical.

In addition to its own REST-based (Representational State Transfer) API, OpenStack supports Amazon’s
EC2(ElasticComputeCloud)andS3(SimpleStorage Services)APIs.This allows companiestocontinue
to use their legacy Amazon Web Services APIs to manage their applications until they can take
advantageoftheadvancedfunctionalityofthenativeOpenStackAPI.

OpenStackCompute
OpenStack Compute (code-named Nova) provides all of the facilities necessary to support the life cycle
of instances in the OpenStack cloud. It creates a redundant and scalable computing platform comprising
large networks of virtual machines. It provides the software, control panels, and APIs necessary for
orchestrating a cloud, including running instances, managing networks, and controlling access to the
cloud.
OpenStack Compute is hypervisor agnostic. It supports many of today’s leading hypervisors including
VMWareESX,MicrosoftHyper-V,andCitrixXen,amongmanyothers.
Typical uses include implementing an IaaS platform, scaling up and down to meet demand for web
resources andapplications, processingmassiveamounts of data withtools likeHadoop,andprovisioning
computeresourcesforteamsandprojects.
OpenStack Compute scales to thousands of compute nodes with a shared-nothing architecture. It is
inherentlymulti-tenant,includingbilling,logging,auditing,andend-usercontrolpanels.
A pluggable authentication system makes it possible to easily integrate an existing authentication system
includingthosethatuseanLDAPbackend.
A web control panel suitable for rebranding is available for customer-facing control. OpenStack Compute
also includes reference Android and iOS clients suitable for rebranding to provide provider-specific
supportforitscustomers.
OpenStackStorage
OpenStack Storage (code-named Swift) is modeled after Amazon’s EBS (Elastic Block Store) mass
store.2 It provides redundant, scalable data storage using clusters of inexpensive commodityservers and
hard drives to store massive amounts of data. It is not a file system or a database system. Rather, it is
intended for long-term storage of large amounts of data (blobs). Its use of a distributed architecture with
nocentralpointofcontrolprovidesgreatscalability,redundancy,andpermanence.
Objects are written to multiple storage devices to create a highly redundant storage cluster. Storage
clusters scale horizontally by adding new nodes. OpenStack is responsible for ensuring replication and
integrity across the cluster. Should a node fail, OpenStack replicates its contents from a surviving active
nodetoanothernodetoensurethatthelevelofredundancyismaintained.
Storage attached to an OpenStack virtual machine is nonpersistent. It disappears when the virtual
machine is terminated. Consequently, OpenStack Storage is integrated with OpenStack Compute to
provide persistent storage for OpenStack virtual-machine images and applications. Other uses for
OpenStackStorageincludewebimages,backupstorage,archiving,andemailstorage.
OpenStack Storage may be shared publicly, or it can be kept private. It can scale to multiple petabytes
andbillionsofobjects.
OpenStackImageService
OpenStack Image Service (code-named Glance) is a retrieval system for virtual-machine images. It
provides registration, discovery, and deliveryservices for these images.Itcan useOpenStack Storage or
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage System) for storage of virtual-machine images and their associated

metadata. It provides a standard web RESTful interface for querying information about stored virtual
images.
Clients can register new virtual-machine images with OpenStack Image Service, obtain information on
publicly available images, and download images. The service is compatible with all common image
formats.
Networking
OpenStack ensures that virtual-machine instances are configured so that they can communicate with
themselves and with the outside world. Just as in Amazon Web Services, an instance can have two IP
addresses associated with it. One is a private address used for communicating between instances. The
otherisapublicIPaddressusedforcommunicatingwiththeoutsideworld.
Security
OpenStack security is addressed at all layers throughout the stack. It provides ingress filtering for a
virtual-machine instance based on security groups. A security group is a named set of rules that get
appliedto incomingpackets for theinstance. Eachsecuritygroupcanhavemultiplerules associated with
it such as the source IP address and network, the protocol type, the destination ports, and so forth. Any
packet matching the rules of the security group is accepted; all others are rejected. A null security group
blocksalltraffic.
OpenStackprovidesnoegressfiltering.Alloutboundtrafficisallowed.
The OpenStack development team recognizes that securityis a complex, evolving issue that needs to be
aggressively pursued and exposures eliminated. It encourages the reporting of security vulnerabilities to
itsOpenStackVulnerabilityManagementTeam.
OpenStack Commands
OpenStack provides commands for administrative tasks such as user management, instance
management,andnetworkmanagement.Thecommandclassesincludethefollowing:3
Euca2oolsCommands
Eucalyptus (an acronym for “Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking Your Programs To Useful
Systems”) is a software platform for the implementation of cloud computing clusters. It implements the
Amazon Web Services API. OpenStack provides the Eucalyptus command line tools called Euca2ools,
which can be used internally to interact with an OpenStack cloud or externally to interact with Amazon’s
EC2cloud.
User/RoleManagement
With the commands to manage users and their roles, the system administrator can add, list and delete
users, associate users with existing projects, view and modify access keys of users, assign user roles,
andchecktoseeifauserhasaspecificrole.

InstanceManagement
OpenStack defines instance types byspecifying the amount of memory, the number of virtual CPUs, and
thedisk storagethatcan beallocatedtoaninstancetype.Withtheinstancemanagementcommands,an
administratorcandefineandremoveinstancetypesandcanlistthecurrentinstancetypes.
ServiceManagement
The administrator can check the state of all available services, enable or disable a service, and view the
resourceutilization(numberofCPUs,memory,anddisk)ofvariousOpenStackcomponents.
ProjectManagement
The administrator can create, manage, and delete projects. He can list the registered projects, download
the files for a specific project, and check the resources allocated to a project such as storage and virtual-
machineinstances.
DatabaseManagement
OpenStack stores the data related to a project, its users, and its resources in a relational database. The
administrator can obtain the current database version and can sync the database schema to the current
version.

Summary
In the early days of Edison, companies depended upon their own electrical generators to power their
factories. These generators were the equivalent of today’s data centers. Then local standardization
allowed communities to share a common power system for lighting, manufacturing, and other uses. This
is where we are presently in our cloud technology. It wasn’t until national and international standards
were developed that nationwide power grids could serve all communities. Thus was created the true
electricutility.
Similarly, a true compute utility is awaiting the development of accepted standards. Only then can a
company plug into the public cloud of its choice for its computing needs. OpenStack is a heavily
supported industry effort to create such standards via a free and open mechanism. Thousands of
developers are now contributing their time and talent to this important project; and as time goes on, it is
likely that thousands more will join the effort. Hopefully, OpenStack will be a major step forward in
achievingatruecomputeutility.
