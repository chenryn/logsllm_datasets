focusing our attention on the topics we bypass.With our new Twitter presence, we don’t
have to feel guilty. This article highlights some of the tweets that made headlines in
recentdays.

OnAClearDay:DowntimeInCloudComputing
Power outages don’t happen often, and they rarely affect the whole service. It’s still, however, a
disconcerting thought that downtime, or data loss can result in huge losses and angry customers.
Furthermore, if entire data centers are affected, entire apps and websites can be impacted for hours
atatime.

FromtheAvailabilityDigest."TheInternetHitsaCapacityLimit."
OnthemorningofTuesday,August12,2014(EasternStandardTime),theInternet
slowed to a crawl. The reason was not a datacenter failure or a network outage. Rather, a long-
known limit of the Internet had been exceeded. The problem was in the Border Gateway Protocol

Availability Digest guest author Paul Holenstein, Gravic Inc. EVP, discusses "Adding High
AvailabilitytotheCloud."
There remains a reluctance among companies to move critical applications to the public cloud and
for good reason. Notable instances of public cloud failures and data loss have been frequently
reported, and security is a concern because the organization no longer has direct control over its
environment.
