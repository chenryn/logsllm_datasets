Mobile Device Threats to Corporate Networks
July2013
BringYourOwnDevices(BYOD)arethenewgatewaysintocorporatenetworks.Anincreasingnumberof
employees are using their smart phones, tablets, and notebook computers to conduct their work at home
or on the road by connecting outside the corporate firewall into their companies’ servers and databases.
This is a great convenience for workers and represents an increase in productivity for their employers –
thedistinctionofafixedworkdayisdisappearing.
Unfortunately, BYOD also means that malicious actors can gain access to a company’s network by
infecting these devices, which are woefully unprotected. Mobile malware is rapidly becoming a greater
concernthandirectinfectionsofthesystemsthemselves.
Mobile Malware Aimed at Android Devices is Climbing Rapidly
Mobilemalwareis mostapt tobeintroduced into amobiledevicebymalicious applications obtained from
appstores thatare not vettedbyGooglefor Android devices or byApple for iOS devices. Because of the
open source provided by Google’s Android operating system, the bulk of mobile malware ends up on
Androidphonesandtablets.1
According to studies conducted by McAfee and Juniper Networks, the number of malicious mobile apps
has grownmorethan 600% in the last year aloneto over aquarter-millionapps. Thepercentage of these
appsaimedatAndroiddeviceshasgrownfrom24%to92%overthelastthreeyears.
Juniper’s report identified more than 500 Android application stores that are known to host mobile
malware.60%oftheseoriginatefromeitherChinaorRussia.
Critical Threats of Mobile Malware
A commonfree app (one is known as Fake Installer) tricks users into sending messages to premium-rate
numbers set up by the attackers. The user is billed several dollars for each message that is sent (either
purposefully by the user or automatically by the malware). This can lead to exorbitant telephone bills for
theuser.
However, this is an attack directly on the user. Of more concern is mobile malware that is directed at
gaining access to corporate assets. Marble Security, Inc. (www.marblesecurity.com), a company that
offers a mobile-security cloud service to protect against threats to enterprise systems by mobile devices,
has published a study identifying nine major mobile threats perpetrated against mobile workers. These
threats are summarized below. Reference should be made to Marble’s white papers2 to gain an
understandingoftheprotectionsthatareavailabletothwartthesethreats.

Malware,Trojans,andZero-DayAttacks
Malware, Trojans, and zero-day attacks generally infect a device by disguising themselves as legitimate
apps. Trojans open back doors that remote control sites can use to infect the device with malware. Zero-
day attacks use unknown vulnerabilities that are exploited to infect a device with malware before the
developerofthesoftwareknowsaboutthevulnerability.

Drive-by attacks on Android phones have become prevalent. With this strategy, an attacker redirects

Commercial antivirus software is the common defense against the insertion of any type of malware into a
device.While these solutions are an important defense against infections, theycannot completelyprotect
a device (and thus the enterprise) because malware authors create new versions at rates that often
exceed the capacity of the antivirus vendor to identify the attack, add the defense to its product, and get
updatesdownloadedtodevices.
Anti-malware scanners for mobile devices are not nearlyas sophisticated as those for PCs.The potential
ramifications of an employee using an infected Android tablet or a Galaxy phone to access corporate
informationshouldbeofutmostconcerntoacompany.
Jail-BrokenandRootedDevices
Both Android and iOS devices are configured to prevent unauthorized access to privileged commands.
However,thisprotectioncanbebroken,especiallyforAndroiddevices.
An Android devise can be modified by the user to allow applications to have root operating-system
privileges.Thisisnecessaryinordertoruncertainapps.Inarooteddevice,malwarecanbeinstalledthat

A similar technique for iOS devices is jail-breaking. However, in the tightly controlled iOS world, jail-
breaking requires bypassing several iOS securityfunctions simultaneously and generallycannot be done
bytheuser.
A rooted Android or jail-broken iOS device can be infected with malware that can be particularly
destructive, difficult to detect, and difficult to remove. An employee may not even know that his Android
has beenrooted.Perhaps his teenagesonhas rooteditsothathecandownloadafreeappthatcanonly

KeyLoggers

Another technique is for the user to install a virtual keyboard, which allows the user to insert small icons
such as smiley faces in text messages and emails. The virtual keyboard app may be infected with a key
logger.
CompromisedWi-FiHotspots
Wi-Fi hotspots are popping up everywhere. Employees access their corporate networks from coffee
shops, airports, hotels, and many other places. Wi-Fi hotspots often lack firewalls or web intrusion
systems.CorporatedataisvulnerablewheneveranemployeelogsintoaWi-Fihotspot.
Wi-Fi networks arefrequentlyconfigured so that anyone on the network can see all of the network traffic.
If an employee uses a non-encrypted session to access his Facebook account, his session can be read
by a hacker. The hacker can send emails with malware or malicious links to all of the employee’s
Facebookfriends,includingseveralofhisco-workers.
Monitoring open Wi-Fi networks is a trivial effort. For instance, Firesheep, a commercial downloadable
app,allowsahackertoseeanyunencryptedtrafficonanetwork.
PoisonedDNS
Regardless of platform type, devices are configured to use a DNS service to route their URL requests to
an appropriate IP address representing the website they are directed to access. DNS services are
provided by ISPs,Wi-Fi hotspots, hotels, airports, and anywhere else a mobile device is likely to connect
to the Internet. Essentially, the user is being asked to trust the DNS server being provided to him, but he
hasnoknowledgeorcontroloverthatDNSserver.
It is possible for hackers to hijack a DNS server and redirect traffic to a malicious DNS server that points
users to a web site that looks just like their corporate, banking, or retail web site to which they are
connecting. There, the hacker can capture the employee’s password and credentials and gain access to
hisaccountsandoftentothecorporatenetwork.
As an example, in late 2012, DNS servers were poisoned in Romania and Pakistan. The entire countries

MaliciousandPrivacyLeakingApps
If only Apple App Store and Google Play applications are being used on iPhones and Androids, and the
devicesarenotjail-brokenorrooted,thedevicesshouldberelativelysecure.
However, there are legitimate applications that can gain access to sensitive corporate information. For
instance, a productivity app may request access to the device’s address book. The contents of the
address book may be downloaded to an app server, where it may be compromised by a hacker. This
means that cybercriminals may have in their possession the names, positions, telephone numbers, and
email addresses of manyof a company’s employees. This gives the hacker everything he needs to know
forspearphishingandadvancedpersistentthreatsagainstmanyofthecompany’semployees.
In another scheme, hackers download popular applications such as Angry Bird for Android and insert
malicious code to steal information. The infected applications are then posted to malicious Android app
websites. With hundreds of such sites, it is unreasonable to assume that employees will download apps
onlyfromGogglePlay.
Cybercriminals have also been creating fraudulent online banking apps. Potential victims are then sent

UnpatchedOSVersions
A lesson learned in the PC marketplace is that the latest patches must be applied to the operating
system. Manyof these patches close security vulnerabilities that can be used to exploit the device. Older
versions are almostalways subjectto zero-dayattacks(unknown vulnerabilities at the timeof therelease
of the operating-system version), known threats, and malware designed to attack certain versions of an
operatingsystem.
It is now possible to read the operating system version for Android and iOS devices. System

SpearPhishing
Spear phishing (or just phishing) is the practice of targeting individuals in a company rather than every
subscribertoaparticularservice.Spearphishingrepresentsasignificantthreattobusinesses.
Therearetwoprimarymethods for phishing – emails and SMStextmessages.For atypical email attack,
the attacker obtains an employee’s email address and sends him an email with a malicious link or that
points him to an infected website. If the employee clicks on the link or visits the malicious web site, his
devicebecomesinfected.
Spam filters have been an effective defense against phishing attacks to some extent. However, in 2012
alone, more than 300,000 new phishing sites a month were discovered. Spam filters just cannot keep up
withallofthese.
With SMS phishing, a user is sent a text message to try to get him to log on to his banking account or
ontohiscorporatenetwork.
AdvancedPersistentThreats
Advanced persistent threats (APTs) areattacks carriedout bycriminal organizations (or evenstates) that
have the resources and time to figure out how to get into any corporation’s network. A recent example is
theUSD$45millionheistagainsttwoMiddleEasternbanksusingcompromisedgiftcards.3.
Even some of the most sophisticated and highly secured networks have fallen prey to APTs. In 2011,
RSA Security was breached and its entire database of RSA tokens was stolen. In this case, RSA was
targeted simply by phishing. Phony emails purportedly coming from the human resources department
were sent to a half-dozen employees advertising open jobs. When the employees downloaded the
infectedPDFfileattachedtothemessage,theattackershadaccesstothenetwork.
Once malicious software is on an end-users device that is connected to the corporate network, either at
the office or through a VPN, hackers are free to escalate privileges on the company’s servers and
databaseandmonitoreverythingonthenetwork.
Summary
Attacks against corporate networks invariably begin by stealing an employee’s credentials. When
employees access the network from a device that is beyond the control of IT, the risk represents the
weakestpoint inthenetwork.Whilenosinglesolution canprotectagainsttheconstantexplosionof cyber
