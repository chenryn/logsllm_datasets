| stated that the throttle time lag was 0.3 seconds.                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| It fell to the author to program and test the throttle-control        |
| routine. In plots produced by a simulation that accurately modeled    |
| the DPS using the time lag of 0.3 seconds, I observed the oscillation |
| that occurred in the actual thrust level after a large throttle       |
| change was commanded without compensation for the throttle lag. When  |
| I compensated for 0.1 second I saw that the oscillation was reduced.  |
| When I compensated for 0.2 seconds the oscillation appeared to be     |
| virtually eliminated. There the matter rested. Klumpp remembers me    |
| saying, \"It\'s just like medicine, don\'t give it more compensation  |
| than it needs\".                                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Klumpp knew it was *not* \"just like medicine\", but he never         |
| insisted that I program the correct number. Examining his motives 15  |
| years later, Klumpp wrote:                                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| I thought it was important to nurture self-reliance, to let           |
| coworkers\' decisions on small matters prevail, even when not         |
| optimum. So I withheld my thoughts and let Don\'s decision stand, at  |
| least until he might reconsider it independently\[20\].               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Examining my own motives, I believe that the annoyance I felt toward  |
| the compensation terms for cluttering up my throttle logic may have   |
| translated into a desire to compensate no more than necessary. Be     |
| that as it may, both Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 flew with 0.2 seconds of |
| compensation for a 0.3 second throttle delay.                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| But now both Klumpp\'s analysis\[21\], and an independent report      |
| prepared by J. A. Sorensen at Bellcomm\[22\], concluded that \"The    |
| oscillatory character of the P66 throttle command was apparently due  |
| to the actual value of the descent engine time constant being smaller |
| than that assumed\" (Sorensen). Klumpp tracked it down. The           |
| performance of the descent engine had been improved, but the ICD was  |
| not modified accordingly. The actual time lag for the descent engine  |
| was about 0.075 seconds. It turned out we had overcompensated. As a   |
| result the throttle was barely stable.                                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Klumpp\'s analysis had an even more startling result. It showed that  |
| if the software had compensated at 0.3 seconds on Apollo 11, the      |
| throttle would have been unstable. The throttle oscillations, instead |
| of settling down, would have become greater. Following throttle-down  |
| in P63, or perhaps in P66 under the excitation of IMU bob, the DPS    |
| engine would have rapidly oscillated between minimum and maximum      |
| thrust. No doubt mission control, quite logically, would have linked  |
| the throttle behavior to the 1202 alarms that were occurring for      |
| entirely independent reasons.                                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| An abort would have been inevitable. With all modesty, it appears to  |
| be the case that if the author had coded the \"correct\" compensation |
| number in the throttle-control routine, Apollo 11 would not have      |
| landed. I invite someone with no personal stake and a grasp of the    |
| mathematics to reexamine this theory.                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| \*       \*      \*                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| We fixed IMU bob by removing the velocity changes caused by IMU       |
| motion from the acceleration measurements. We corrected the throttle  |
| time lag and simulations showed that this indeed fixed the throttle   |
| instability. Neither fix was on Apollo 13, but that mission was not   |
| able to attempt a lunar landing.                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Curiously, a change made *before* the throttle problem came to light, |
| which was on Apollo 13, would have offered a backup if the automatic  |
| throttle had failed. A new noun (92) was defined that the crew could  |
| select to see the throttle level desired by guidance. Logic that      |
| would have terminated automatic guidance if the throttle were (or     |
| appeared to be) switched to MANUAL was removed. These changes\[23\]   |
| let the astronaut take control of the throttle during P63 or P64      |
| while guidance continued to command attitude. I do not know whether   |
| these difficult procedures were ever practiced.                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The problem of the Executive overload alarms was dealt with several   |
| times over.                                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The rendezvous radar mode switch was placed in LGC for ascent. For    |
| future missions the descent checklist was changed. Meanwhile we added |
| logic to LUMINARY to check the rendezvous radar mode, and if it was   |
| not in LGC, send a signal to zero the rendezvous radar                |
| counters\[24\].                                                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Allan Klumpp studied the Executive problem from another angle. He     |
| discovered that under conditions in which TLOSS occurred              |
| intermittently, or when the level of computer activity fluctuated in  |
| the presence of TLOSS, it was possible for incomplete SERVICER jobs   |
| that had been interrupted during the issuance of attitude commands,   |
| but had not yet been flushed by a software restart, to be resumed at  |
| a later time --- with the possibility that inappropriate attitude     |
| commands could be issued to the autopilot. In time for Apollo 13      |
| Klumpp devised a fix in which an occasional whole SERVICER job would  |
| be dropped to catch up, if necessary.                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| But for the future, none of these changes provided fundamental relief |
| from the constraint of the fixed, two-second guidance period. A       |
| terrain model needed to be added to the landing radar routines to     |
| allow landing in difficult terrain. Guidance modifications were       |
| waiting in the wings. Where would the time come from?                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| We developed a concept we called \"variable SERVICER\", in which the  |
| guidance period was allowed to stretch if it needed to. Fears that    |
| the two-second interval was built inextricably into the software      |
| proved unfounded. It was only necessary to measure the guidance       |
| period and use that value explicitly in place of the two seconds that |
| was implicit in a few calculations. We got variable SERVICER working  |
| in an offline version of LUMINARY, and demonstrated its immunity to   |
| very high levels of TLOSS\[25\].                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Freedom from the two-second straitjacket allowed other ideas to be    |
| considered. Astronaut John Young suggested a capability that we       |
| called P66 LPD. By now P66 had evolved into an even more flexible     |
| program than it was when Armstrong flew it on Apollo 11. One of its   |
| new features was that if the crew switched the attitude mode back     |
| from ATT HOLD to AUTO, guidance would then control the attitude to    |
| null the horizontal velocity. Young\'s idea was for the LGC to        |
| display an LPD angle (as during the visibility phase) that would show |
| the Commander the spot over which the LM would come to hover, if at   |
| that instant the autopilot were switched to AUTO\[26\].               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| To make P66 LPD accurate, the software had to react instantly when    |
| the astronaut switched to AUTO --- more quickly than the two-second   |
| period, or even the one-second period at which parts of P66 operated, |
| allowed. We coded a version in which a job running every quarter of a |
| second reacted to the change in autopilot mode by immediately issuing |
| attitude and throttle commands, and responded far more quickly and    |
| precisely to inputs from the ROD switch as well. In manned            |
| simulations run at the LM Mission Simulator (LMS) at Cape Canaveral,  |
| with its fabulous terrain models visible in the LM\'s windows, we     |
| showed that this system facilitated very precise landings.            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Neither variable SERVICER nor P66 LPD ever flew. NASA had made the    |
| decision that Apollo 17 would be the last landing. With so few        |
| missions remaining, the software control board made the conservative  |
| decision --- no major changes to the landing software. By             |
| synchronizing the landing radar measurements with the time the        |
| accelerometers were read, Robert Covelli gained enough time to        |
| squeeze in the terrain model for Apollo 15, 16, and 17.               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Apollo 14 brought the author a brief notoriety. The abort switch on   |
| the instrument panel was sending a spurious signal that could have    |
| spoiled Alan Shepard and Ed Mitchell\'s landing. I had written the    |
| code that monitored this discrete. The workaround simply changed a    |
| few registers, first to fool the abort monitor into thinking that an  |
| abort was already in progress, and then to clean up afterward so that |
| the landing could continue unaffected. The procedure radioed up and   |
| flawlessly executed by the astronauts involved 61 DSKY keystrokes.    |
| Perhaps the most interesting part of the Apollo 14 incident has been  |
| the number of differing versions that have been offered to history.   |
| But Apollo 14 is a story for another day.                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| In December 1972 I traveled to Cape Canaveral for the launch of       |
| Apollo 17. At this moment spaceflight was hip. The writer Tom Wolfe   |
| was there with photographer Annie Leibovitz to write the four-part    |
| story for Rolling Stone magazine that was the precursor of \"The      |
| Right Stuff\"\[27\]. It was the only Apollo night launch. The misty   |
| Florida sky lit up orange from horizon to horizon as the huge Saturn  |
| V ripped downrange on a quarter-mile flame that licked at the end     |
| like a blowtorch.                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| I spent a few days at the LMS testing some procedures that we called  |
| \"erasable memory programs\". These were snippets of code that could  |
| be installed in unused VAC areas to handle certain malfunctions ---   |
| an idea that was a legacy of the Apollo 14 incident. Then I flew back |
| to Cambridge for the landing itself.                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| After that came the pleasure of listening in while Gene Cernan and    |
| Jack Schmitt, a geologist by training, explored the Moon in the lunar |
| rover, venturing over 3 miles, out of sight of the spacecraft. And    |
| that was the last time anyone walked on the Moon.\                    |
