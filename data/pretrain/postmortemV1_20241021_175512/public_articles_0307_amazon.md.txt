How Many 9s in Amazon?
July2008
Foundedin1994andheadquarteredin Seattle,Washington, Amazon.com is arguablythe largest
online retailer in the world. Supporting not only its own retail operations but also those of
thousands of small retailers (and some large ones as well), Amazon welcomes about 60 million
shopperstoitsstoreseachmonth.
Amazon started out as an online bookstore. It soon diversified and now carries a wide range of
products, including video tapes, DVDs, CDs, computers, video games, electronics, toys, sports
equipment, apparel, and tools. It has web sites in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France, Germany,
China, and Japan. Its annual revenues exceed $10 billion, and Amazon is now one of the stocks
intheS&P500.
Amazon Web Services
In 2002, Amazon launched AmazonWeb Services (AWS). AWS is a collection of online services
for other web sites or client-side applications using the immense Amazon infrastructure. These
services offer functionality that other developers can use. Amazon claims over 300,000
developersusingAWS.
Among the dozen services provided by AWS are the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and
the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). These two services are central to our Never Again
story.
AmazonSimpleStorageService(S3)
In early 2006, Amazon launched Amazon S3. S3 is essentially what its name implies – an online
storage service that a customer can use to store an unlimited number of data objects through a
simple web services interface. Data objects may be from one byte to five gigabytes in size, and
theyaredistributedbyHTTP.
Amazon charges for storage and for bandwidth used. S3 uses the same scalable storage
infrastructure that Amazon.com uses to run its global e-commerce network. It is reported that
AmazonS3currentlystoresmorethanfourteenbillionobjects.
S3’s designgoalsincludescalability,availability,andlowlatencyatcommoditycosts.Objectsare
organized into buckets owned by an AWS customer. Within a bucket, objects are identified by
uniquekeys. Bucketnames andkeys arestructuredsothatobjects are addressable viastandard
URLs.Forinstance,oneURLformatishttp://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/key.
Access to a bucket can be controlled by an access control list, and requests for data can be
authenticated through the AWS Authentication service. As we shall see, this authentication

Because objects are accessible by unmodified HTTP clients, S3 can be used to provide a
standard web-hosting infrastructure. As a consequence, many small enterprises use Amazon S3
forwebhosting,forimagehosting,fordatabasebackup,andformanyotherpurposes.S3byany

AmazonElasticComputeCloud(EC2)
Later in 2006, Amazon introduced its EC2 service. EC2 provides scalable virtual private servers
using the Xen open source virtualization hypervisor.1 The virtualized server farm uses the
Amazon server infrastructure with its high availability to run diverse customer applications,
includingwebhosting.
Customers can buythe amount of virtualized computing capacitythat theyrequire. EC2 provides
scalable deployment of applications by providing a web services interface via which customers
can request any number of virtual machines. Each of Amazon’s servers can run many such
virtual machines. Customers can run any applications that they desire on any of their virtual
machines. They can create, launch, and terminate virtual machine instances on demand; thus,
theterm“elastic.”
Whencreatinga virtualmachine, thecustomer canspecifythat it be equivalenttoasmall, large,

 A small virtual server is the equivalent of a one gigahertz Opteron or Xeon single-core

 A large virtual server is the equivalent of a 64-bit quad-core Opteron or Xeon processor

 An extra-large virtual server is the equivalent of an eight-core processor with 15

Service Level Agreements
Initially, Amazon would not agree to provide service level agreements (SLAs). They argued that
sinceS3andEC2services usedAmazon’sowninfrastructure,ofcoursetheywouldbereliable.If
anyproblemoccurred,itwouldbeAmazon’stopprioritytocorrectthesituation.
However, in October of 2007, Amazon began offering an SLA for its S3 service. The SLA
guaranteed a 99.9% uptime on a monthly basis. S3 is the only AWS service for which Amazon
currentlyoffersanSLA.
The SLA did not have a lot of teeth for the customer. If the service did not achieve 99.9% uptime
but did achieve at least99% uptime,then 10% of the monthlyfeechargedto the customer would
be applied against the next month’s charges. This adjustment would apply if S3 was down for
more than 45 minutes per month, and it covered downtime up to seven and a half hours per
month. For a typical customer, this might amount to a few hundred dollars a month in
compensationforhoursoflostbusiness.

Friday, February 15, 2008 – The Dreaded S3 Outage.
Remember the S3 authentication services provided by AWS?These authenticated data requests
are encrypted and consume significantly more computing resources than normal data requests.
Amazon provides the server capacity that is required to handle this authentication load based on
twoyearsofexperience.
However, early in the morning of Friday, February 15, 2008, around 3:30 AM, system operators
started seeing unusually elevated levels of authentication requests for multiple users at one of
their three locations that provide AWS services. Shortly before 4:00 AM, several other users
significantly increased their volume of authenticated requests. This overloaded the S3
infrastructure, and Amazon was unable to process any requests at that location. The infallible S3
servicesweredown!
It took until 6:48 that morning to reconfigure enough capacity to handle the increased
authorizationloadandtoreturnS3servicestoAmazon’scustomers.
For almost three hours, thousands of web sites that depended upon S3 and its companion EC2
service were down. This included such sites as social networking site Twitter, browser
technologist AdaptiveBlue, photo-sharing service SmugMug, and web-application developer
37Signals.
An outcry arose from the customer community about Amazon’s lack of communication
concerningtheproblemsduringtheoutage.Customerscomplainedthattheyhadnowaytoknow
whether the problem was due to their equipment or to Amazon’s services. There were neither
email notifications nor updates on Amazon’s AWS blog. Customers felt that there should at least
have been a notice posted on the front page of Amazon’s web services site so that they would
haveknownthattheproblemwasnottheirs.
Following restoration of services, Amazon acknowledged the severity of the problem and listed a
set of actions that it intended to take to prevent such an occurrence in the future. These actions
included:
 improvingmonitoringofauthenticatedcallrequests.
 increasingauthenticationservicecapacity.
 addingadditionaldefensivemeasuresaround authenticatedcalls.
 developingaservicehealthdashboard(anuptimedashboard).
This episode wasn’t the end of EC2 problems. Earlythe morning of April 7, EC2 reportedlyagain
went down for about an hour. However, this time it affected only some U.S. customers. This, of
course,issmallconsolationtothoseaffected.
Friday, June 6, 2008 – An Encore
During the morning of Friday, June 6, Amazon suffered another embarrassment. This time it was
in its core business - the Amazon.com online retail store. Amazon.com went down for over three
hours, affecting U.S and U.K. customers. All these customers received was an error message
that said “Http/1.1 Service Unavailable.” Other international customers were not affected, nor
were AWS services. However, U.S. and U.K. retail customers who could not connect to
Amazon.comwerenotredirectedtootheroperationalsites,astheyshouldhavebeen.

U.S. and U.K. sites went down rather suddenly at about

9:30 AM. U.S. services returned about an hour later but
were then sporadic until about 1:00 PM. U.K. services were

This time, there was no explanation for the outage (so far 0.6

that created a load so great that the servers could not
handle it, and they shut down. This theory was supported
(Credit:KeynoteSystems)
bythe fact that this failure coincided with a known attack on
Amazon’s Internet Movie Database (IMDB). A single attacker flooded this site with requests
forimages.
The theory was further supported by many users who said that their requests were blocked
because the requests were suspected of coming from a bot or an automated script. Others
conjectured that the outage was caused by bots trying to scoop up Metal Gear Solid 4, an
80-gigabyte pack for PlayStation 3 that had just been released. This had happened once
beforeonThanksgivingDay,2006,whenMicrosoftreleaseditsXboxvideogames.
Inanyevent, Ad Ageestimated thatthe outagecost Amazon about $1.8million dollars for a
two-tothree-houroutage.
Some Outside Help for EC2 Users
Hyperic, Inc. (www.hyperic.com), a young company providing open-source monitoring and
management software for web infrastructure, has announced its product Hyperic
CloudStatus that willprovidean independent view of thehealthandperformanceof someof
Amazon’s web services. Included in the monitored services are S3 and EC2. This free
service gives AWS customers the perspective they need to determine the cause of
performanceproblemsintheircloud-basedwebapplications.
According to Hyperic, CloudStatus “provides a comprehensive measure of service
availability, latency and throughput for cloud-based infrastructure and application services.
Users can drill down for detailed metrics on any of the monitored offerings. These metrics
are specific to each individual service and are designed to answer the questions most often
askedbythedevelopersandadministratorsthatrelyontheservicesfortheirbusiness.”

Lessons Learned
CustomerCommunications
Like so many other service providers about which we have reported, Amazon did not get kudos
for its customer communications, either during its EC2 failure or during its retail-store failure.

Cloud-Computing9s
Cloud computing can bring tremendous advantages to small organizations that do not want to
manage their own data centers. Scalable storage and computing capacity on demand make it
easy to host, manage, and operate their own applications, whether it be their web sites or other
corporateapplications.
However, it is clear that if uptime is critical, an organization must accept that cloud-computing
systems do fail and that the business will suffer downtime over which the organization has no
control. Even a three 9s SLA means that there may be over eight hours of downtime per year –
andthatisiftheSLAismet.
Therefore, some sort of backup must be provided to a cloud-computing environment to carry
business operations through these outages. Even Amazon is not immune to the failure of its own
highly-sophisticated infrastructure, as evidenced by the June 9th failure of its U.S. and U.K. retail
operations.
Certainly, as big-technology companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, and others start to
compete in the web-based services arena through cloud computing, reliability will be one of the
mainfeaturesdistinguishingtheirofferings.2
