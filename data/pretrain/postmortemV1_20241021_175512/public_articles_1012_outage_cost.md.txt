The Cost of Datacenter Outages
December2015
The Ponemon Institute has released its 2013 Cost of Data Center Outages report.1 This
report summarizes a survey conducted by the Institute of 67 data centers that
experiencedanoutageinthepastyear.Itfollows asimilarreportpublishedin2010.Thesurveyfindsthat
the average cost of a datacenter outage is about USD $690,000, and its average duration is 86 minutes.
The outage costs are linearly related to the length of the outage and to the size of the data center. All
amountsbelowareinU.S.dollars.
Cost Framework

The sizes of the data centers ranged from 1,300 square feet to 46,000 square feet, with an average size
of 12,500 square feet. The outage durations ranged from 15 minutes to 400 minutes, with an average
duration of 86 minutes. The cost per outage ranged from $74,000 to $1,700,000, with an average cost of
$690,000.
Activity Costs
The average costs of outages by cost category (except for containment costs) were as follows. All
amountsareinU.S.dollars:
CostCategory AverageCost
Businessdisruption $238,717
Lostrevenue $183,724
End-userproductivity $140,543

Totalaveragecost $690,205
The cost of business disruption and lost revenue account for more than 60% of all costs associated with
anoutage.

Cost Relationships
Duration
The relation of cost to the duration of the outage is nearly linear. On the average, the cost of an outage
was$7,908perminute.Overthesampleofthesurvey,thelowestcostper minute was$939.Thehighest
costperminutewas$16,246.
DatacenterSize
As with duration, the cost of an outage was linearly related to datacenter size. However, the larger the
data center, the less cost per square foot was incurred. For small data centers, the cost of the outage
averaged $95 per square foot. For the largest data centers in the survey, the cost of an outage averaged
$45persquarefoot.

Caveats
ThePonemonInstitutelistsseveralcaveatsforitssurvey:
 Thestudydrawsuponanon-statisticalsampleofdatacenters;andstatisticalinferences,margins
oferror,andconfidenceintervalscannotbeappliedtothesurveyresults.
 The findings are based on a small representative sample of completed case studies. It is limited
to data centers that were known to have had one or more outages over the past year. Of 560
organizations that were contacted, only 67 ended up in the survey. Non-response bias was not
tested.
 Itis the Institute’s belief thatthesurveyis biasedtowardcompanies withmorematuredatacenter
operations.
 The quality of the survey is based on the integrity of confidential responses. There is always the
possibilitythatrespondentsdidnotprovidetruthfulresponses.

Summary
There was a 41% increase in downtime costs in the 2013 study relative to those found in Ponemon’s
2010 study. This underscores the importance of minimizing the risk of downtime that potentially can cost
thousandsofdollarsperminute.
Industries with revenue models dependent upon datacenter availabilityto deliver services to customers –
such as telecommunication service providers and e-commerce companies – and industries that deal with
a large amount of secure data continue to incur the most significant costs associated with downtime.
While such organizations saw a slight decrease in their downtime costs from 2010, those organizations
that traditionally have been less dependent on their datacenters saw a significant increase. The largest
increase was in the hospitality sector (129%), followed by the public sector (116%), transportation
(108%),andmedia(104%).
As there is an increasing need for companies to adapt to a more social, mobile, and cloud-based model,
thecriticalityofminimizingtheriskofdowntimeisgreaterthaneverbefore.
