Help! My Data Center is Down!
Part 3: Internet Outages
December2011
Long gone are the days of the isolated data center. Back then, batch jobs were submitted to update
databases and to generate reports. Back then, turn-around times were measured in hours or even days.
Intoday’scompetitiveenvironment,ITservicesareonline;andinstantresponsetimesareexpected.
What good is a data center if no one can talk to it? Orders can’t be placed or tracked. Medical records
can’t be accessed. Online banking comes to a halt. Today’s data centers must be connected. They
dependuponthenetworksthatallowuserstoaccessthemonlinereliablyandwithfastresponsetimes.
In the old days, a company had control over its communication network. It leased lines that it used
exclusivelyfor its purposes. If it lost communications, it had direct access to its communication carrier for
rapid repair. For critical applications, companies installed redundant communication facilities so that they
couldcontinueinoperationeveninthepresenceofacommunicationsfailureononeoftheirlines.
Not so true today. More and more, companies are relying on the public Internet to connect their users
withcompanydatacenters.ButhowreliableistheInternet?
Inourpreviousarticles inthisseries,werelatedhorrorstoriesofunimaginablepowerfailuresandstorage
failures that took down the best-designed data centers. In this article, we explore some notable Internet
failures that rendered data centers useless even though they were otherwise fully operational. These
storiesaretakenfromtheNeverAgainarchivesoftheAvailabilityDigest.1
The Internet
The Internet is cheap. Today’s browsers make it easy for users to connect to data centers. The Internet
is flexible. If a new system comes online, no problem; just update the DNS server - there is no need to
negotiate new leased lines with your carrier. The Internet is a self-repairing fabric. If a fault occurs at a
node, traffic is simply rerouted around that node. But as a self-repairing fabric, does the Internet ever go
down?Youbet.
VandalsTakeOutMuchofSiliconValley
Thousands of businesses and individual users in Silicon Valley and the San Francisco area were without
Internet, phone, and wireless services for more than twelve hours on April 9, 2009, when vandals cut
communication cables used by AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint. Cables were cut in two locations within a two-
hour period. It turned out to be an easy operation. All the vandals had to do was to lift a manhole cover,

climb down a ladder, and cut the cables. Though the perpetrators have yet to be caught, it is suspected
that they may have been disgruntled employees since they seemed to have direct knowledge of which
cablestocut.
SoutheasternNevadaTelecommunicationsServiceInterruptedforTwoDays
All of Southeastern Nevada lost Embarq services and some Verizon services, including all Internet
access, on the morning of December 10, 2008. A construction crew digging trenches for a new sewer
system in downtown Las Vegas severed a conduit carrying several copper and fiber cables used by
Embarq. It took two days to restore service. Verizon leases some of these channels from Embarq, and
their services were consequently affected. This supports our rule that you should be sure that your
redundant communication links do not use some common third-party carrier, or else your redundancy
mayberenderedmeaninglessbyafaultinthethird-party’snetwork.
HawaiiansGoWithouttheInternetforAlmostanHour
Over 400,000 Hawaiians get their Internet, telephone, and television service from Oceanic Time Warner
Cable. On May 2, 2009, a power outage caused by a generator defect took down Oceanic’s cable and
broadband services, affecting over 200,000 subscribers. Backup batteries powered the system for a few
minutes,butthebackupdieselgeneratorfailedtostart.Thoughservicewasrestoredinlessthananhour,

ComcastOutageKillsInternetforMarylandandDelaware
A concrete mixing truck accidentally hit a power pole on July 3, 2009, cutting Comcast’s fiber line. The
accident took outInternet,telephone,and videoservices for alargeareaof the lower Maryland-Delaware
area for several hours. Even after the damage was repaired and after service was restored, multiple
temporary outages continued for another several hours. During the outages, merchants could not accept
credit cards; and the local newspaper, the Ocean City Today, could not get the emails necessary for its
weeklyissue.
CouldtheLondonOlympicsBeNext?
London is set to host the Summer Olympics in 2012. BT (British Telecom) is the official communication
services provider for the Games, and it is determined to have a flawless operation during the Olympics.
Good luck. On Saturday afternoon, April 6, 2009, contractors working on the Olympic site sent a large-
thrustborer right through a deep BT tunnel,severing multiple fiber cables andshutting downInternetand
othercommunicationservicesfortensofthousandsofcustomers.Thecabletunnelwas32meters(about
100 feet) below street level. The tunnel was completely blocked and unsafe, and its depth made it very
difficult to repair the cables. They had to be pulled to the surface, repaired, and then routed through a
newconduit. BT was abletorestoreservicetoabout70% of thedownedcustomers intwodays,but30%

UnderseaCableFaultTakesOutInternetthroughoutWestAfrica
There is only one fiber-optic cable linking West Africa to the rest of the world; and on July 30, 2009, the
landing cable linking Nigeria failed. 70% of Nigerian Internet services went down, and other neighboring
countries lost 100%. Though Nigeria had built a redundant land network, there was no backup for the
landing cable. The only way to reroute traffic was over limited, expensive satellite channels. Banking
services, phone services, and Internet services were all impacted. It took days to repair the cable and to
returnservicetothesecountries.

TyphoonDisruptsEastAsianInternetandVoiceServices
From August9to August12,2009,users inTaiwan,Singapore,HongKong,and thePhilippines watched
their Internet services deteriorate from slow to none. It turns out that Typhoon Morakot damaged several
undersea cables, not directly, but through undersea landslides. The landslides occurred over a several-
day period, breaking cables one at a time. Though it took months to repair the cables, service was

BanditGameServersTakeDownMuchofChina’sInternetServices
China is rife with private servers used to illicitly run copies of popular games for profit. The operators of
these servers have a history of launching distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks on each other.

WildStreetSawDisruptsNewYorkTrading
Just before the end of the trading day on September 15, 2009, when hedge funds depend upon
millisecond trade execution times, a construction saw in one stroke severed 144 strands of fiber carrying
60,000,000 connections in New York City. The fiber cables fed just one building, a critical hub for global
Internet connectivity in the Wall Street area. Though the fiber network throughout New York Cityis highly
redundant with many alternate paths, one engineer said that 99% of New York buildings have single
pointsofentryforalloftheircommunicationfacilities.
EventheAmazonGorillaGoesDown
A “networking event” on April 21, 2011, brought down portions of Amazon’s cloud computing
infrastructure along the U.S. East Coast. The problem triggered a large amount of remirroring of EBS
(Elastic Block Storage) volumes in Amazon’s northern Virginia data center, which handles Amazon Web
Services in its East Coast Availability Zone. The remirroring activity caused a shortage of capacity in the
Availability Zone, which impacted EBS volume recovery and new EBS volume creation. The outage,

SouthAfricaIsolatedforaDaybyaCableFault
The SAT-3 undersea cable that carries most of the traffic between South Africa and Europe broke down
for about 24 hours on January21, 2010, effectivelyisolating South Africafrom Europe and therest of the
world. The incident started when Telkom, the cable operator, began maintenance on the cable after
informing customers that they might experience increased latency on the channel for four to six hours.
However, an error bymaintenance personnel working on the power units caused a massive failure of the
cable.

Customers of Mediacom, a major ISP serving 22 states in the middle U.S., started having problems with
InternetconnectivityTuesdayevening,January22,2010.Atfirst,onlycustomersinColumbia,Iowa,were
impacted. But by the next evening and throughout the following morning, the problem had spread to
customers in 22 states. The problem was finallytraced to a routing error at Mediacom’s Internet Network
Operating Center in Iowa. Mediacom has installed additional monitoring facilities to address similar
problemsmoreefficientlyinthefuture.

Superior were cut off from the rest of the world for about twelve hours by a fiber cable break. The North
Shore is connected to Duluth, MN, via a single cable – no redundancy. Conjecture is that the cable was
laid alongside a steam pipe, and the heat destroyed the cable. Affected were 911 services (which are
routed to Duluth),senior FirstCall emergencyalertbuttons,customs agents at theCanadianborder, ATM

SkypeHolidayPresent–DownforaDay
Just as businesses were winding down for the holidays and as families were busy making plans to get
together, the popular Skype Voice over IP (VoIP) telephone service went quiet. From the morning of
Wednesday, December 22, 2010, customers were unable to place calls for over a day. Skype’s network
is a distributed peer-to-peer network in which hundreds of thousands of supernodes provide directory
service and routing. Skype installs its VoIP supernode servers on any customer PC that is not behind a
firewall. A bug in its supernode server caused certain nodes to crash, overloading other nodes. The

submarine cables that lie in the Mediterranean Sea. Internet traffic for India, Pakistan, and the Middle
Eastern countries are also routed to Europe over these cables. The cables link Alexandria, Egypt, with
Palermo, Italy, where the traffic then moves on to Europe, the UK, and the Eastern United States. On
January 30, 2008, two of these three cables were severed by the anchor of a huge freighter. All traffic
was rerouted to the third surviving cable. However, the third cable became seriously overloaded, making
the Internet almost useless and voice traffic barely intelligible. It took several weeks to repair the cables

QueenslandTelephoneServiceSeveredbyCableCut
A fiber-optic cable was cut by workers laying a pipe for Australia’s Queensland water grid on July 15,
2008, collapsing the Optus communication network for over four hours. Communications throughout
Queensland were abruptly terminated for more than a million customers when rerouting failed. Airports,
hospitals, 000 emergency calls, government services, stockbrokers, and Internet access were all

Summary
A data center is useless if it is not accessible. Data centers use the Internet to provide connectivity
between their external users and their data center servers. If the Internet should be lost, so are the
servicesprovidedbythedatacenter.
As the above stories illustrate, the Internet is not a guaranteed service – it is a best-efforts service. It can
and does fail, often for days over wide geographic areas. Every company should have as part of its
