How the Ukraine Power Grid Was Hacked
March2016
As reported in the Availability Digest’s January 2016 issue,1 hackers disabled a major
portion of Ukraine’s power grid on the afternoon of December 23, 2015. Without power
for six hours were 230,000 customers. Though operators were able to restore power by traveling to the
substations and manually closing circuit breakers that had been opened by the attack, operators still are
unabletocontrolthecircuitbreakersremotelyfromtheircontrolcenters.

The Preparation for the Attack
Based on evidence discovered after the attack, preparation by the hackers had been in progress for at
leastsix months.Ukrainehas 24regions withadifferentpower distributioncompanyservingeachregion.
During mid-2015, a phishing campaign delivered emails to workers at three of the companies. To each
email was attached a Word document that contained a malicious macro. A popup asked the recipient to
enable macros for the document. If done, the macro opened a backdoor that allowed the malware
packageBlackEnergytoinfectthemachine.
BlackEnergy has been found in control systems the world over. Though it is capable of doing damage to
the computers it infects, it is used primarily for data gathering. Over the next several months, the
attackers used BlackEnergy to map the network topology of the infected power distribution companies
and to steal the credentials of the network operators. Observing the actions of the operators, the hackers

The Execution of the Attack

 Step 1 – The UPSs (uninterruptible power supplies) at the control centers was reconfigured so
that the attackers could control them. When the UPSs were turned off, this put the operators in
thedark.
 Step 2 – The hackers wrote malicious firmware to replace the legitimate firmware in the Ethernet
controllers that control the substations. This firmware would prevent the operators from sending

On the fateful afternoon of December 13th, the attack began. The hackers disabled the UPS systems,
plunging the control centers into the dark. They entered the SCADA (supervisory control and data
acquisition) networks using the workers’ stolen credentials (two-factor authentication was not being used,
which would have prevented the attackers from gaining access to the SCADA systems). They also
launched a Telephone Denial of Service (TDoS) attack against the customer call centers to prevent
customers from calling in and reporting outages. A TDoS attack involves flooding a call center with
thousandsofbogustelephonecalls.
In addition, the hackers overwrote the firmware in the Ethernet controllers with their own malicious
firmware.Thispreventedcommandsfrombeingsentfromthecontrolcenterstothesubstations.
The progress of the attack was described by one worker. He noticed that the cursor on his computer
suddenlystartedmovingacrossthescreenofitsownaccord.Hewatchedasitnavigatedtowardsbuttons
controlling the circuit breakers at one of the substations. The cursor clicked on a control button to open a

Theoperator triedtoseize control of the cursor,but it was unresponsive to his commands.Thecomputer
then logged him off. He couldn’t log back on. It was discovered later that the attackers had changed his
password.
Circuit breaker after circuit breaker was opened by the remote-controlled cursor. The substation was
quickly taken offline. This process continued at the three control centers under attack, taking thirty
substationsofflineandkillingpowerforhundredsofthousandsofUkrainians.
The operators tried desperately to close the circuit breakers and to restore power but to no avail. No
control executed at the control center could be sent to the substations in the field because of the
malicious firmware injected into the Ethernet controllers. Personnel ultimatelyhad to be sent into the field

The Aftermath of the Attack
Months after the attack, the hacked power-grid control centers still are not fully operational. The infected
control systems have to be replaced with systems with the proper firmware. Until that is completed, the

The attackers also deleted the logs and other forensic data that would allow investigators to determine
how the attack occurred. It therefore has been difficult to determine exactly what happened and how the
powergridwastakendown.
Who Was Responsible for the Attack?
The culprit was never identified. Russia was suspected but has denied any involvement. Russia had just
annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, and Ukrainian saboteurs had cut the power cables supplying
power from the Ukraine to Crimea, plunging parts of Crimea into darkness for two weeks.2 The attack

What has been determined is that the hackers made phone calls from Russia and that they used a
Russian-based Internet service provider as part of the attack. U.S. researchers surmised that the attack

Summary
This is the first known instance of malware being used to generate a power outage. It certainly sends a
warningtocountriesaroundtheworld,includingtheU.S.,astothedangersofhackingattacks.
Experts say that the control systems in Ukraine were surprisingly more secure than some in the U.S.,
since they were well-segmented from the control-center business networks with robust firewalls. But in
the end, they weren’t secure enough. Workers logging into the SCADA network that controlled the grid
weren’t required to use two-factor authentication, which allowed the attackers to hijack their credentials

Such an attack could come from another nation, though this seems unlikely since the attacking nation
would be subject to a retaliatory attack (though the identity of the attacker easily is hidden by attacking
throughacircuitousroute).
However, there is no such reluctance imposed on terrorist groups that are unaffiliated with a nation-state.
It is imperative that the industrial control systems and the SCADA systems that control the power grids of
the world be highly secure and that provisions are in place to rapidly restore power in the event that a
