Gfail?,” we chronicled almost nine months of Google’s Gmail email service failures and its steps
to stem the tide. But just as that issue was being published, Gmail went down again - for almost
22 hours for some subscribers. The outage was aggravated by the failure of the backup system.

unauthorizedusers.

California. An Atlanta-based company, Earthlink serves about 2.8 million customers who could
not access their email or web sites hosted by Earthlink. The outage was so total that all
communications with Earthlink were even severed because they use their own services. The
Earthlink web site was down as were their telephones (after all, they use their own VoIP
telephoneservices).Theycouldnotevenbereachedbyemail.
NetworkFaultTakesDownFreePhoneService
bizjournals, April 22, 2009 – Free phone services provided by Ooma (after the purchase of a
$250 Ooma box) were lost for most of the day when Ooma lost connection to the Internet. Ooma
blamed their ISP, Internap. This began a finger-pointing argument when Internap stated that they
had not lost connectivity with any other customers in the area. Ooma claimed they had the
network logs to prove their point. In any event, the lack of redundancy in the network doomed
Oomacustomersthatday.
