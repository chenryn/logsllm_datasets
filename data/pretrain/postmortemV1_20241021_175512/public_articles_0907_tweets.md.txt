availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass.With our new Twitter presence, we don’t
have to feel guilty. This article highlights some of the tweets that made headlines in
recentdays.

New LinkedIn Thread on the Continuous Availability Forum: “Windows XP, Windows Server 2003
–Whatareyoudoingforcompliance?”
Organizations that use unsupported operating systems are no longer compliant with many
regulations. In particular, continued use of Windows XP (now) or Windows Server 2003 (in a year)
will violate PCI DSS compliance. Does your organization still run these operating systems; and if so,
whatareyourplansforupgrades?
