Megaplex: An Odyssey of Innovation
December2009
Tandem Computers was born 35 years ago. My, how time flies. The Digest editor’s1 first
experiencewithTandem was32yearsagowhenhewasresponsiblefordevelopingtheracetrack
totalizator system to be sold by Autotote of Wilmington, DE. The availability of this system was
paramount, as there had been riots at racetracks when earlier totalizators had failed just before
racetime,andnoonecouldbuylast-minutetickets.Tandemwastheobvioussolution.
Jim Johnson of The Standish Group has memorialized the impact that Tandem has had on the
computing industry in his paper, “Megaplex: An Odyssey of Innovation,” freely available at
www.standishgroup.com/megaplex. In this paper, he traces the history of Tandem’s unique
technicalinnovations andextends them tothe Megaplex.Hedefines the Megaplex as “afabric of
resourcesthatwillprovideforapplicationservicesforthenext35years.”
Johnsonintroduceshispaperwiththefollowingopeningparagraph:
Three decades and five years ago, four founders,James Treybig, Mike Green, Jim Katzman,
andJack Loustaunou,broughtforth anew system, conceived in availability,and dedicated to
the proposition that there will be no single point of failure. Started in 1974, Tandem
Computers quickly became a poster child for fast-paced, venture-backed high technology
firms. During the past 35 years, some of the brightest and most creativeengineershave
worked on the Tandem NonStop platform. They have contributed to the IT industry some of
the most important innovations for high-end commercial computing. This report will take you
on a small stroll down memory lane, looking at the current NonStop position and usage as
well as how The Standish Group believes NonStop may evolve into the future. To make this
journey,weinvestigate10areasofinnovationandNonStop’sroleinthese.
Hegoesontosay:
While it is interesting to study the past, organizations are making decisions now and need to
consider how these decisions will affect them today and into the future. Today’s NonStop is
full of innovation and technology. In the future, NonStop technology will be the base for the
Megaplex, a fabric of resources that will provide for application services for the next 35
years.

CPU (Central Processing Unit)
Johnson traces Tandem’s central processing unit from the 1970’s 16-bit proprietary CPU using
transistor-transistor logic (TTL) to the MIPS chip sets and now to Intel’s Itanium-based Integrity
processors.
The Megaplex will be a fabric comprising a wide variety of processors from low-end to highly
redundant systems. Organizations will be able to manage their resources by dynamically
deployingservicestomatchperformance,availability,andbudgetaryrequirements.
Operating Systems
Tandem’s first operating system, and still the kernel for its current operating systems, was
Guardian (later a personality along with OSS on top of the NonStop Kernel). Guardian was
unique for its time since it was a message-oriented, distributed processing operating system that
providedfaulttolerance,dataintegrity,andscalability.
The Standish Group sees today’s operating systems merging into a Megaplex operating
environment comprising a lightweight kernel surrounded by operating utilities. These utilities will

Programming Language
Tandem’s first programming language was TAL – the Tandem Application Language. To speed
application development, Tandem offered Encompass to speed the writing of online transactions
and Enform for report writing. NonStop systems now support the object-oriented languages C++
andJava.Today,NonStopapplicationscanbedevelopedonanyplatformusingEclipse.
In the future, organizations will do away with periodic releases of massive applications and will
instead have a continuous development process of smaller units of work. These micro-
applicationswillbemanagedthroughtheMegaplexfabric.
Database
Tandem’s databases have progressed from flat files through Enscribe to the linearly scalable,
massivelyparallelNonStopSQL.
In the Megaplex, all databases will be equal and transparent. Data will reside in any database,
including Oracle, Sybase, NonStop SQL, SQL Server, and DB2. Data will be reorganized to
reflect the operational needs of the function (OLTP, ODS, BI, etc.). This reorganization will be
accomplishedbytheMegaplexwithlittleifanyinterventionfromoperationsstaff.
Storage
Applications to which Tandem systems were originally applied – stock exchanges, ATM, and
POS – had relatively small storage requirements. However, data integrity was paramount and
wassuppliedbyTandem’smirroreddiskswithdualdatapaths.TheNonStopplatformwasableto
scale to massive amounts of directly-attached or network-attached storage to satisfy the
requirementsforsuchapplicationsasdatawarehousingandbusinessintelligence.
The future of NonStop storage is in the transparent, virtualized storage of the Megaplex. This
storage will benefit from industry-wide advances in storage technologythat require no application
changes.

Networks
Tandem’s influence on network technology was driven by its need for high-speed, reliable
interprocessor communication. Starting with the dual Dynabus, Tandem followed with the fiber-
optic FOX interconnect and then today’s ServerNet fabric, which has become the basis for the
industry-standardInfiniBand.
NonStop has an extremely low rate of security incidents. In the Megaplex, NonStop will be the
heart of a smart network that will direct activities to achieve the best use of the Megaplex’s
resourceswhileprotectingthemfromunwantedintrusionandmaliciousbehavior.
Systems
Tandem’s real innovation was reflected in its multiprocessor system architecture. This provided
not only massive scalability but also fault tolerance – all the way down to dual fans. Though until
recently using proprietary components, NonStop BladeSystems now use standard HP blade
components.TheonlyuniquecomponentisaServerNetboardineachbladeprocessor.
In the Megaplex, there will be no specific NonStop hardware. The innovative functional
technologybroughtaboutbyTandem willliveontoprovideavailability,scalability, andsecurityof

Administration
The number of people required to manage a NonStop system is a fraction of what is required by
other systems. A single operator can manage hundreds of NonStop processors and dozens of
systems from a single console. Other administrative advancements include remote problem
resolution,rollingsoftwareandhardwareupgrades,andonlinebackupsandrestores.
The Megaplex will inherit HP’s fully automated management capability, which it calls Business
Technology Optimization (BTO). BTO will benefit from the capabilities of NonStop, making the
Megaplexevenricherincapability.

In effect, NonStop was the originator of the cloud platform, which can deliver services faster, at
lower cost, and with greater accountability. The Megaplex is the perfect platform for cloud
computing. NonStop technology will offer Megaplex consumers the ability to choose higher

Summary
The next stage in the evolution of NonStop will be software advances; the uniqueness of its
hardware will disappear. NonStop will join the innovations from many companies to create the
Megaplex.TherebirthofNonStopwillbetheMegaplex.
In the Megaplex, NonStop will become the heart of the operating environment service. Much of
