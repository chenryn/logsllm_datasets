have to feel guilty. This article highlights some of the tweets that made headlines in
recentdays.

DCtransmissiontechnologymayturnbacktheclock.

TheInternetofThingsismakinghospitalsmorevulnerabletohackers
Ransomware and denial of service attacks are just a glimpse of things to come - hospitals are the
next big target for cyber-attacks, and the introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) devices make
healthcare even more vulnerable. As a result, hospitals need to change their attitude towards
security. "The need for improved and even remote patient care drives hospitals to transform by
adapting smart solutions, ignoring sometimes the emerging security and safety issues. Nothing
comes without a price - hospitals are the next target for cyber-attacks," says European tech security
agencyEnisa.
