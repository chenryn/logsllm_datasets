\"In addition, our cleanup service had been briefly disabled to
troubleshooting a potential race condition. Then we turned the automated
cleanup back on. The service had a default hard coded amount of how many
image names to query from our internal image catalog and it was set to
100.\
\
When we started the cleanup service, the list of 100 image names, sorted
by newest first, did not include our stable images, which were the
oldest, did not get included in the results. Our cleanup service then
promptly started deleting the older images from GCE, because its view of
the world told it that those older images where no longer in use, i.e it
looked like they were not in our catalog and all of our stable images
got irrevocably deleted.\
\
This immediately stopped builds from running. \"

\"While removing a faulty router from service, a new procedure for
diverting traffic from the router was used. This procedure applied a new
configuration that resulted in announcing some Google Cloud Platform IP
addresses from a single point of presence in the southwestern US. As
these announcements were highly specific they took precedence over the
normal routes to Google\'s network and caused a substantial proportion
of traffic for the affected network ranges to be directed to this one
point of presence. This misrouting directly caused the additional
latency some customers experienced.\
\
Additionally this misconfiguration sent affected traffic to
next-generation infrastructure that was undergoing testing. This new
infrastructure was not yet configured to handle Cloud Platform traffic
and applied an overly-restrictive packet filter.\"

OK, a quick post-mortem:\
\
At 9:45 AM PST I got a ping that crates.io was down and started looking
into it. Connections via the website and from the \'cargo\' command were
timing out. From Heroku\'s logs it looks like the timeouts began around
9:10 AM.\
\
From looking at logs (18 28) it\'s clear that connections were timing
out, and that a number of postgres queries were blocked updating the
download statistics10. These queries were occupying all available
connections.\
\
After killing outstanding queries the site is working again. It\'s not
clear yet what the original cause was.

\"What happened behind the scenes was that our Apache ZooKeeper cluster
lost quorum, for the first time in more than three years. After recent
maintenance, a heap space misconfiguration on the new nodes resulted in
high memory pressure on the ZooKeeper quorum nodes, causing ZooKeeper to
spend almost all CPU garbage collecting. When an auxiliary service that
watches a lot of the ZooKeeper database reconnected, this threw
ZooKeeper over the top, which in turn caused other services to reconnect
-- resulting in a thundering herd effect that exacerbated the problem.\"
