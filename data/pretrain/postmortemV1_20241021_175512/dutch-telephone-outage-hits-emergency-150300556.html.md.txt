THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) --- A major telephone outage took down the
Dutch emergency number for more than three hours Monday, forcing police
and other first responders to scramble to set up alternatives.

KPN tweeted at around 7:40 p.m. (1740 GMT) that the outage had been
repaired, the 112 alarm number was working again and mobile and fixed
phone services were restored.

The outage began around 4 p.m. (1400 GMT) forcing emergency services to
quickly establish new contact numbers that were publicized on social
media and via push alerts to many mobile phones.


Police also sent officers onto the streets so that people could approach
them for emergency help and advised people suffering medical problems to
go to the nearest hospital.

\"We\'re appealing to everybody who wants to report an emergency and
needs help to \... go onto the street. Police officers with
walkie-talkies are taking to the streets as much as possible so they can
be spoken to,\" police spokeswoman Suzanne van de Graaf told national
broadcaster NOS.

Some police forces advised people to use social media if they need to
contact emergency services, while others advised people to go to public
buildings for urgent help.

Justice and Security Minister Ferd Grapperhaus said in a tweet that he
was \"in direct contact with KPN\" about the outage.

The cause of the outage was not immediately clear.
