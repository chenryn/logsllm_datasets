First Stuxnet – Now the Flame Virus
June2012
Itwasjusttwo yearsago,inJune,2010,thattheStuxnetvirus wasfound.1Atthetime,itwastermed"the
most refined piece of malware ever discovered.” The worm was significant because mischief or financial
reward wasn't its purpose. It was aimed right at the heart of a critical infrastructure. Stuxnet was
specifically designed to cause Iran’s centrifuges used in its nuclear program to spin out of control and to
destroythemselves.Itwasthefirstknownvirusthatcoulddamagecriticalinfrastructure.
Theinternationalalarm createdbyStuxnethasnowbeensupersededbyanewlydiscoveredvirus,Flame
(alsoknownasFlamerorsKyWIper).TheUN’sInternationalTelecommunicationsUnion(ITU)hasissued
a Flame warning to its member nations that it says is the most serious cyber warning it has ever put out.
In its present form, Flame is not designed to do physical damage. Rather. it is an extraordinarily
sophisticated surveillance tool that appears to be used for dangerous espionage of targeted systems.
However,itsarchitecturelendsitselftobeeasilyextendedtoStuxnet-likedestructivecapabilities.
The Discovery of Flame
Flame was discovered quite by accident by the large Russian anti-virus firm, Kaspersky Labs, the same
company that first identified Stuxnet. The Iranians had notified the ITU about a virus that was wiping out
disk files. The ITU asked KasperskyLabs, which provides virus protection for Iran, to tryto find the virus.
Kaspersky was unable to do so, but instead found Flame in April, 2012. It determined that Flame had
infected almost 200 Iranian computers and was targeting Iran’s Oil Ministry, its oil rigs, and its major oil
export hub. In response, Iranian computer technicians took drastic actions, cutting off all Internet links to
itscomputers.
Kaspersky announced Flame to the international community just recently, on May 28, 2012. However, it
estimatedthatFlamehasbeenaround,undetected,since2010.
When Stuxnet was discovered, its size was surprising. It measured a half-megabyte in size, which was
considered quite large for malware. In comparison, Flame is massive. It comprises about 20 megabytes
ofcode!Itisdeemedtobethemostcomplexmalwareeverfound.
Interestingly, its very size may be what allowed it to go undetected for two years. Evidently, malware-
detection facilities assume that viruses are small so as to go undetected. The massive size of Flame
madeitappearnottobemalwareatall.
Further, as we will describe, Flame has infected only a very small number of targeted computers. It
operates in such a way that a user never notices its actions; and when it has finished its job, it deletes
itselfandmovesontoothercomputers.

How Is Flame Built?
Kaspersky Labs, Symantic, and others have called Flame the most powerful, ingenious, and stealthy
malwareeverwritten.
Surprisingly, the Flame core is
programmed in Lua, a video-gaming
language used for such popular games
as Angry Bird. The Flame core
comprises twenty modules, each with a
different purpose. It can deploy any of
itsmodulestoatargetedcomputer.The
module subroutines and libraries are
generally written in C++, and the total
packagecomprises about 650,000 lines
of code and consumes twenty
megabytes of storage. It currently
infects only Windows systems –
Windows7,WindowsXP,andVista.
Each of Flame’s surveillance
capabilities is represented by a
separate module. It appears that a
computer is infected initially with only a basic set of modules. Stolen data is organized into a local SQL
database and periodically sent over an SSL link to a network of eighty command and control computers
located in Asia, Europe, and North America for further analysis bythe Flame operators. It they determine
that a specific computer is of interest, the operators can deploy additional modules for further
surveillance.
It appears that the network of command and control computers represents a limited resource. Only a
small number of computers are infected at any one time. When Flame has finished with a computer, it
deletesitselfwithoutatraceandmovesontoanothercomputer.
It is not known how Flame is spread. Common conjecture is that it initially spreads through email
phishing,andthenspreadsitselffurtherovernetworksandviaremovablemedia.

So far, there has been no evidence of malicious, damaging actions by Flame, such as disk wiping or
attacking critical infrastructure. However, with its modular architecture, there is not much to prevent such
attackmodulesfrombeingdevelopedanddeployedinthefuture.
How Far Has Flame Spread?
Because Flame infects only a few computers at a time and departs a computer when it has finished
without a trace, it cannot be determined how many computers Flame has infected. The rough estimates
arethatithasinfectedbetween1,000and5,000computerssofar.
It appears that most of the infected computers are in Middle Eastern countries. Of roughly400 confirmed
infections, almost half are in Iran. Israel and the Palestine territories account for 25% of the infections. A
fewinfectionshavebeendiscoveredinSudan,Syria,Lebanon,SaudiArabia,andEgypt.
Who Dunnit?

Neither country has confirmed that it is party to the Flame attacks. It has been noted that only traces of

However, Israel has not gone so far as to deny complicity. An Israel leading politician, Vice Premier
MosheYaalon,madethefollowingstatement:
“WhoeverseestheIranianthreatasasignificantthreatislikelytotakevarioussteps,includingthese,to
hobble it. Israel is blessed with high technology, and we boast tools that open all sorts of opportunities
forus.”
The Defenses Against Flame
Running and debugging Flame is not trivial. It comprises several DLL libraries that are loaded at system
boot time. It includes SQL databases with nested queries and uses several encryption methods and
compression algorithms. It is purposefully written to be confusing to thwart security experts from easily
decipheringit.KasperskyLabsestimatesthatitmaytakeyearstofullyunderstandFlame.
However, KasperskyLabs and other antivirus organizations,as well as Iran,havereleased detection and
removalkitsforFlame.
Summary
What might the future bring? Stuxnet and Flame have demonstrated troubling capabilities for nation-
states to wage cyber war on each other. Maliciousness can range from sophisticated surveillance to
attacks against critical infrastructure. This malware is becoming increasingly difficult to detect and
impossibletotracktoitssource.
It seems that cyber warfare has arrived, and it is incumbent upon every organization and every nation to

Postscript
According to a June 6th Symantic report, the controllers of Flame have ordered it to self-destruct and to
erase all traces of itself in order to impede the forensic analysis of its code. A suicide module is trying to
locate every infected computer to remove Flame’s files and to overwrite the disk areas that it used with
