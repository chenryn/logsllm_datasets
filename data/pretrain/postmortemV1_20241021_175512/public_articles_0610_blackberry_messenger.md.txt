stock was depressed after a disappointing earnings report. It was losing market
share to Apple’s iPhone and the raft of Android-based smart phones. Apple’s
iMessenger, a direct competitor to BBM, was set to launch. To make matters

Research in Motion
RIM (www.rim.com), located in Toronto, Canada, introduced its BlackBerryservice in the mid-1990s. The
BlackBerry rapidly became the corporate darling for cell phone and texting service and dominated the
businesssectorforyears.BlackBerryservicesnowhave70millionsubscribersworldwide.
Then came smart phones. RIM was late to enter the smart-phone race. Though businesses continued to
rely heavily on BlackBerry services, RIM faced significant competition from more entrenched products
such as Apple’s iPhone and the myriad smart phones based on Google’s Android operating system.
Consequently,RIMexperiencedproblemswithattractingnewsubscribersandretainingcurrentusers.
RIM recently entered the tablet race but has sold far fewer PlayBook tablets than it had anticipated. It
missed its quarterly revenue goal for its third quarter, and its quarterly profits plummeted by 58%. Its
market share has dropped from dominance to the single digits. RIM stock has fallen from a 2008 high of
$144persharetoarecentlowof$20.

The BlackBerry network was designed in the mid-1990s when public cellular networks were in their early
stages. The network is unique among handset makers, as it compresses and encrypts data before
pushing it to BlackBerry devices via carrier networks. Apple and others rely on the carrier networks to
handleallroutinganddeliveryofcontent.
TheBlackBerryMessengerService
To increase market penetration, RIM introduced its BlackBerry Messenger service in 2008. The BBM
serviceallowsBlackBerryuserstosendfreetextmessagestootherBlackBerryusers.
With BBM, users can send and receive text messages of unlimited length. The sender receives
confirmation that his message has been delivered and read. Friends can be added easily, and text
messagescanevenbesenttofriendswhoarenotBBMsubscribers.Photos,videos,andvoicenotescan

The Precursor
A month before the October outage occurred, storm clouds gathered over the BlackBerry network. On
September 16, 2011, subscribers in Canada and Latin America suffered partial outages. Sporadic tweets
from other countries such as England and Egypt indicated that the problem might be even more
widespread.
RIMkeptitsusersinformedviatherelativelyinformationlesstweet:
“Some Canada and LatAM customers report BBM issues. Our support teams are investigating. We
apologizeforanyinconvenience.”
Servicewasrestoredthesameday.
The Outage
Monday, October 10th, looked like a repeat of the outages that had occurred during the previous month.
BBM services were reported to be down throughout the Middle East, Europe, and Africa. Again, RIM
acknowledgedtheoutagesandreportedthattheywereworkingtocorrecttheproblem.
On Tuesday, the outages were not yet corrected. Instead, they spread to South America and Asia.
Canada and the United States were engulfed by the crisis on Wednesday. The outage affected text
messaging and Internet access but not regular telephone service. BlackBerry had lost its core services
suchasBBM,email,andwebbrowsing.Forthesethreedays,millionsofusersthroughouttheworldwere
withouttheBlackBerryservicesuponwhichtheydepended.
Finally, on Thursday, service began to be restored. It took another day or two to clear the backlog of
messages and emails. BlackBerry was totally out of service for almost four days and then suffered
additionaldaysofslowserviceuntilthingsreturnedtonormal.
The Cause
As seems to be characteristic of RIM, it was initially tight-lipped about the outage and downplayed just
howwidespreadtheproblemreallywas.Finally,onOctober11th,RIMreleasedthefollowingstatement:
“The messaging and browsing delays being experience by BlackBerry users in Europe, the Middle
East, Africa, India, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina were caused by a core switch failure within RIM’s
infrastructure. Although the system is designed to fail over to a backup switch, the failover did not
function as previously tested. As a result, a large backlog of data was generated, and we are now
workingtoclear thatbacklogandrestorenormalserviceas quicklyas possible.Weapologizefor any
inconvenience,andwewillcontinuetokeepyouinformed.”
The problem was caused by a failover fault in its European NOC that spread to other network nodes. It
was apparently the large backlog of email and text messages that overflowed to other switching nodes
that slowly overwhelmed the network and that spread the outage slowly over several days to the rest of
theworld.
The Fallout
This outage was severe enough that it made the network news. TV commentators on CNN and MSNBC
reported the BlackBerry failure. The CEO of RIM made a TV appearance to prove how seriously the
companywastakingtheoutage.

Toaddinsulttoinjury,Apple’siMessage,astrongcompetitortoBBM,launchedontheWednesdayofthe
outage.
Theweek's disruption was the worstsincea BlackBerryoutageswept North Americatwo years ago.This
most recent outage may have damaged RIM's once sterling reputation for secure and reliable message
delivery-perhapsitsNo.1sellingfeature.
Even before the week's disruptions, many companies had started to balk at paying a premium to be
locked into RIM's service. Some were allowing employees to use alternative smartphones, particularly
Apple's iPhone, for corporate mail. The outage could accelerate this trend, eroding RIM’s market share
evenfurther.
The corporate defections are making a big software transition even more crucial to RIM. The company is
getting ready to shift its line of BlackBerry smartphones to the new central operating system first used in
the poorly received PlayBook tablet. Without a successful shift, analysts fear, RIM may never regain the
marketsharelosttotheiPhoneandtodevicespoweredbyGoogle’sAndroidoperatingsystem.
Lessons Learned
This outage paralleled a similar outage in April, 2007, when a deficient software upgrade took down the
Canadian NOC; and the backup system could not be brought into service.1 BlackBerrys were down for a
half day. Less than a year later, in February, 2008, the BlackBerry service went down for several hours
becauseofanupgradegonewrong.2Again,inDecember,2009,BlackBerryservicewas upanddownfor
overaweekasRIMtriedtocorrectanotherbadupgrade.3
Thesefailures have a common thread – testing. Improper upgrades that take down a system can onlybe
attributed to inadequate testing of the upgrades. In addition, before attempting any upgrade, there should
beafallbackplanthatwillallowabadupgradetobebackedout.
Failover faults, as in this most recent outage, are also often a function of inadequate testing. Testing
failover of systems as large as the BlackBerry Network Operating Centers is a complex, expensive, and
riskyundertaking.However,ifproperperiodictestingisnotdone,theorganizationisdependinguponfaith
and hope that the backup will come into service when needed. These are not the attributes on which one
shouldbettheenterprise.
Finally, as pointed out in the other Availability Digest articles concerning BlackBerry failures, RIM has
consistently avoided transparency when it comes to its failures. As opposed to services like Amazon and
Google, where outages are fullyexplained, RIM keeps outage details close to its vest. It is even reluctant
to inform users as to the outage status as it unfolds. Others have found that users are much more
forgivingandloyalwhenthereisgoodcommunicationwiththemduringandafteranoutage.
