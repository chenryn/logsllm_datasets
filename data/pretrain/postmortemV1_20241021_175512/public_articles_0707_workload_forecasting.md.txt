Introduction by Bill Highleyman
Is your business growing at a rapid rate? Are your IT systems getting close to their capacity limits? Is
there enough of a capacity margin to get you through the peaks of the coming year? What will a CPU

At the recent BITUG (British Isles Tandem User Group) meeting in London in December, 2011, Damian
Ward, NonStop Solutions Architect at VocaLink, presented an in-depth analysis of the capacity planning
used by VocaLink, the provider of the Faster Payments Service (FPS) and LINK Scheme (LS) service to
UKbanks.DamianhasbeenimmersedintheIT industryforover twentyyearsandwas ViceChairmanof

Transaction Volume Forecasting
The process begins by forecasting the daily volume over the next 24 months, a remarkable task in itself.
This is done via a combination of past daily statistics and future monthly projections. Specifically these

PastDailyProjections
VocaLinkuseshistoricaltransactiondatatodeterminevariouspeakratios:
 YeartoPeakMonth
 PeakMonthtoPeakDay
 PeakDaytoPeakHour
 PeakHourtoPeakMinute
 PeakMinutetoPeakSecond
As an example, this analysis might lead to the following tables. Given a monthly transaction volume,
Table 1 shows the ratios to determine the peak day, the peak hour, the peak minute, and the peak
second of the month. VocaLink’s data shows that the peak day of the month is always the last Friday of
the month1. Table 2 allows the calculation of the peak traffic on the other Fridays relative to the peak
Friday.For months withfiveFridays,afifthFridayratiois included).Table3then allows theseprojections

Table1 Table2 Table3
For instance, if the monthly volume is 250,000,000 transactions, the last Friday in that month would
process 12,500,000 transactions, the peak hour 1,125,000 transactions, the peak minute 22,500
transactions, and the peak second 450 transactions. The peak transaction rate for the third Friday of that
month would be 418 transactions/sec. (.93 x 450), and the peak transaction rate for the Tuesday of that
weekwouldbe301transactions/sec.(418x.72).

DailyProfiling
Inordertogetamoredetailedviewofthetransactiondayweanalyzedhistoricaldatatodeterminehourly
transaction volumes for a peak Friday. This gives us the transaction profile for the peak dayas illustrated
below.
This profile is for a peak Friday but matches other weekdays pretty well which all share the typical ‘lunch
time’ peak followed by another busy period following the end of the working day. With a little more effort
thedistributionforweekendsandholidayscouldalsobecreated.Typicallyweekendsandholidaysexhibit
a smoother, less peaky profile. That said, capacity planning is all about the peaks and this is where we

The forward looking transactional model is now complete; this will be used to determine system capacity
requirementsgoingforward.Andtoanswer“whatif”scenarioquestionsfromtheBusiness.
However our work is not yet done with this model, this like any transactional model must be continually
refined over time and must also adapt to changing business conditions. To this end the model is tuned
throughcomparisonwithactualtransactionaldataandisreviewedandadjustedannually.
We work in conjunction with the Business to refine not only their transaction forecasts but also the
mappingfromagivenmonthlytransactionvolumetothepeaksecondvolumesillustratedabove.
Determining Server Workload
The transaction workload imposed on a server can be determined by looking at Measure data gathered
from production and / or volume test environments. This Measure data allows the per-CPU transaction
cost to be calculated. A maximum workload can be determined based on the application. In the case of
the LINK scheme, basic service time to switch a transaction from an transaction acquirer to a card issuer
feed is about 0.1 seconds. Knowing the allowable server loading and the CPU cost per transaction, the
maximumtransactionratethatcanbesafelyhandlediseasilydetermined.
RepresentingCriticalDaysGraphically
The profile of relative transaction volumes for each of the hourly periods in a day can be used to extend
the transaction-rate results across all the hours of the day. VocaLink plots the peak per-second
transaction rates for each hour in an Excel table with colour coding using Excel’s conditional formatting
capability.Theresultisatablethatappearsbelow.
Peak transaction rates near or in excess of the maximum allowable transaction rates are colour coded in
deepening shades of red. In this chart, 345 tps was specified as the critical transaction rate. The periods

Example Case Study - A thought exercise
The analysis discussed so far can be used to illustrate the compound probability of a CPU failure
impacting service. And to help the business select from a number of expansion options. VocaLink had
already planned a migration from S series to an NB series blade system. However prior to the scheduled
migration a software upgrade significantly raised the resource requirements of a core application
jeopardizingoutabilitytocomfortableprocesspeakvolumeswithaCPUdown.
At quiet time a CPU failure would not impact the
service, however at a busy time it could, here we
attempt illustrate and quantify this for each
potentialupgradepath.
Three options were considered to expand the
capacityoftheNonStopS-Seriesservers.
 Option 1,rebalance + shut down nonessential
processes.
 Option 2,upgradetwoof thetwelveCPUs to a
newer version CPU (increase the capacity of
twoCPUsby25%).
 Option 3, add two new CPUs to the current
twelve-CPU configuration (each has 25% more
capacitythanthecurrentCPUs).

TherelativeCPUcapacityofeachoptionisillustratedabove.
Taking this relative capacity and applying to the CPU failure model we can build up various “what-if”
scenarios.
Thesystemcapacity(tps)followingaspecificCPUfailureforeachoptionisillustratedbelow:
Themodel illustrated so far takes manyfactors into account to determine maximum system capacity. For
aProduction/DRconfigurationthemaximum capacityis thatofthesystem with asingleCPU down(n-1)
andwithnoneoftheremainingCPUsrunninginexcessof80%utilized.
This is a relatively conservative approach, these services are designed to be highly available and down
time or degraded service caused byinadequate capacityis the same as downtimecaused bycomponent

The chart also indicates the number of danger CPU’s during each hour, essintially this is taking into
account that the system is not perfectly balanced and that the impact of each CPU failing is different. As

A failure will not be corrected instantly so we also take into account a fix time of 6 hours and add this to
the model as illustrated below. This shows that a CPU failure in any of the hours shown below has the
