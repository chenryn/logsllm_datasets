The Fragile Internet
May2009
As cloud computing looms overhead, the Internet will become ever more important to corporate
well-being. It is already the lifeblood of hundreds of thousands of small online stores hosted by a
variety of software-as-a-service providers. The importance of email services reaches into the
largestenterprises.
The availability of Internet services is of paramount importance to these companies, and its
importance only grows with time. If the Internet is down, so are the operations of many
companies, large and small. The Internet’s mesh architecture is designed to provide the extreme
availability demanded by these users. After all, a fault anywhere in the Internet is automatically
routedaround;andservicecontinuesuninterrupted.
ButistheInternetreallyallthatreliable?Can youbet yourcompanyonthecontinuousavailability
of the Internet? Unfortunately, experience says “no.” As Om Malik, a well-known technology
writer,said,“Our Internetinfrastructure…is as fragile as afine porcelain cupontheroof of acar
zippingacrossapot-holedgoattrack.”
Is this a well-founded statement? Indeed, a recent report by the Business Roundtable,1 a
consortium of CEOs of large U.S. companies, says that there is a 10% to 20% chance of a
breakdown of our critical information infrastructure in the next ten years. They suggest that this
breakdown could be brought about by malicious code, coding error, natural or man-made
disasters,orattacksbyterroristsorotheradversaries.
We review here real-life outages that expose the frailty of the Internet and discuss some of the
defensive measures that companies should consider to protect themselves from similar
experiences.
What? No Internet?
Recorded Internet faults range from metropolitan outages to wide-area outages and on to global
outages.Itseemsthatnoone,andnocompany,istotallysafefromsuchmisfortunes.

January 30, 2008, cutting off Internet service from North Africa, India, and the Middle East to the
rest of the world. The outage lasted for several days and for several weeks in some cases.
Coincidentally, two days later, another cable was cut by an anchor north of Dubai, disrupting

This was notthefirsttimethatsuchaglobalInternetdisaster hadhappened.InDecember,2006,
a magnitude 7.1 earthquake severed nine cables between Taiwan and the Philippines, cutting
Internet and other communication services between southeast Asia and the rest of the world for

The Internet is a highly structured set of interconnected networks. It comprises a network of
autonomoussystems(AS).AnASisacollectionofnetworkscontrolledbyasingleentity,suchas
anISP,acountry,oralargecorporation. BecauseofacapabilityoftheBorderGatewayProtocol
(BGP) that is used to route global traffic between ASs, it is possible for a nefarious AS to hijack
traffic to one or more web sites. It can do this by modifying routing tables in edge routers to

This, in fact, happened to YouTube quite accidentally on February 22, 2008. Pakistan decided to
redirectPakistaniYouTubetraffictoa“blackhole”viaBGPhijackingbecauseofwhatitperceived
to be a blasphemous video clip. However, a simple mistake by an engineer at Pakistan
Telecommunications Authority caused the redirection to be propagated throughout the entire
Internet. YouTube was globally inaccessible for about two hours before the error was reported
andcorrected.

60,000 Embarq and Verizon customers throughout southern Nevada lost Internet and other

Thousands of businesses and individual users in Silicon Valleyand the San Francisco area were

Many configurations used by communication providers use a ring topology so that if a cable is

were either point-to-point, or the ring was otherwise disabled for maintenance. Though the

The cable tunnel was 32 meters (about 100 feet) below street level. The tunnel was completely
blocked and unsafe. Its depth made it very difficult to repair the cables. They had to be pulled to

Terrorism–SometimeintheFuture?
Experts on communication security have pointed out that the most vulnerable point in a
communication network is the central office. It is a hub and a single point of failure for a mass of
communication links. If a terrorist were able to damage or destroy, for instance, Verizon’s central
office in lower Manhattan, communication service to the Wall Street area could be taken out for
daysorevenweeks.4
For this reason, these facilities are heavily protected by security. We trust that we will not be

Summary
We ask again – could your company survive such an Internet outage? Are the procedures for
such an outage incorporated into your business recovery plan? If not, now is the time to decide
whatyouaregoingtodo–notaftertheoutagestrikes.
As seen by the above examples, you could lose Internet access for hours, for days, even for
weeks.Recoveryplanningcouldtakeseveralforms.
At the very least, to protect yourself against local outages, you should be connected to at least
two points-of-presence (POPs) that are independent and separately routed. You should make
surethattheydo notusesomecommonthird-partycarrier whosefailurecouldaffectboth of your
POPs.
You should make sure that your POPs are fault-tolerant, either because they are on a ring
network or on a mesh network. You should insist on seeing a physical diagram of the providers’
network paths to ensure that there are no single points of failure. No one should accept a failure
duetopoint-to-pointconnections.
Another concern is network latency. If you are on the Internet, you have already accepted
response times that are measured often in seconds. However, if your carrier can reroute around
an outage and continue service, that rerouting could seriously increase your response times.
When the Mediterranean Sea cables were cut, Internet access from North Africa to Europe was
rerouted through the Middle East and Asia, across the Pacific Ocean and North America, across
the Atlantic Ocean, and finally to Europe. Can you tolerate very slow response times? Will your
applicationstimeoutandcrash?
But what about wide-area or global Internet outages that cannot be restored by rerouting or for
which rerouting causes such congestion that the Internet is useless to you? As we suggested in
our What? No Internet? article, previously referenced, the first line of defense is a contingency
plan to get reconnected to the Internet. One contemporary possibility is a satellite backup
channel. The hours following a massive Internet failure is no time to try to negotiate backup
channel capacity – there might not be any. There are several companies that offer satellite
backup services, such as VSAT Systems (www.vsat-systems.com). Another is the FailSafe
