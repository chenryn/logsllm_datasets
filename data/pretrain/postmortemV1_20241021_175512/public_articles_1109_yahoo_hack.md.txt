The Hack
Thoughthe breachoccurredinlate2014, Yahoo didnotdiscover ituntilrecentlyanddidnotreport ituntil
September 22, 2016. It is not clear when Yahoo discovered the attack. Their announcement simply said
that“arecentinvestigation…hasconfirmedtheattack.”
The stolen data showed up for sale on the dark web this past August. On August 1, a hacker named
“Peace” claimed to have breached 200 million Yahoo usernames and passwords back in 2012 and
offeredtosellthem onthedark web.InaJuneinterviewwithWired,Peaceidentifiedhimselforherselfas
a former member of a team of Russian hackers who had breached and sold credentials from several
majoronlineservicesin2012and2013.
Itwas Peace’sallegationsthatpromptedYahootoinitiateaninternalinvestigation.WhileYahoofoundno
evidence to substantiate Peace’s claim, this is when it found indications that the larger breach had
occurred. User credentials were out in the open on the dark web for nearly two months before Yahoo
confirmedthebreach.
The hack affected predominantly users in the United States. However, users in Japan, the Philippines,
Taiwan,andHongKongwerealsopossiblycompromised.
Yahoo claims that evidence points to a state-sponsored hacker. Though it did not name a suspect, likely
culprits are China, Russia, and North Korea. (There is a common saying in the security industry: “There
are only two kinds of companies – those who know they have been hacked by China, and those who
don’tknowtheyhavebeenhackedbyChina.”)
Federal and state investigators will likely launch investigations and may possibly demand fines or
penaltiesfromthecompany.

What Was Stolen
The hackers obtained consumer names, email addresses, phone numbers, and birthdates. They also
obtained passwords, but Yahoo claims that the passwords were protected by a complex hashing
algorithm,brcrypt.Hackersalsoobtainedsecurityquestions intheclear (Whatwas your mother’s maiden
name?).Thestolendatadidnotincludepaymentcarddataorbankaccountinformation.
It would take tremendous computing resources to determine the actual passwords from the hashed
versions. However, out of 500 million stolen passwords, it is likely that some of them will be deciphered,
especially if they are of the form “password” or “12345.” If the hackers were successful in decoding only
1%ofthepasswords,theywouldstillhaveaccesstofivemillionpasswords.
Cybercriminals know that consumers use the same passwords across websites and applications. This is
why millions of leaked password credentials coupled with their user names are so useful for perpetrating
fraud.
Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg’s Twitter account was hacked using a similar method after the
passwordsofmorethan100millionLinkedInmemberswereleaked
How to Protect Yourself
Yahoo will be contacting affected uses and asking them to supply “alternate means of account
verification.” Affected users can set up a “Yahoo Account Key” that sends a code by text anytime a user
tries tologontoanemailaccount.Thecodeis receivedontheuser’s mobilephoneandmustbeentered
duringthelogonprocessinordertoaccesstheaccount.
Yahoo users should change their Yahoo passwords and security questions. Users should also be on
guardforspamemailsthatmightincludemalware,scams,orphishingattempts.
The Verizon Merger
Yahoo is in the process of being acquired by Verizon for $4.8 billion USD. Verizon was just recently
notifiedofthebreach.
Studies have shown that 97% of Americans lose trust in companies like Yahoo following a massive data
breach.ItisnotyetclearwhetherthisbreachwillaffectthependingVerizonacquisition.
Summary
The Yahoo hack shows the importance of maintaining appropriate security precautions surrounding
corporate data. Not only should facilities be in place to prevent intrusion from malicious outsiders, but
