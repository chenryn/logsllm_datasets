More Never Agains IX
July2013
Our last several issues of the Availability Digest included many notable failures and cyber attacks that
took down corporate systems. Spamhaus, a spam-site blacklisting firm, was taken down for days by a
massive DDoS attack launched by one of their blacklisted sites. Two Middle Eastern banks were robbed
of USD $45 million by hackers who compromised their gift cards. A phony AP tweet claiming the
President had been wounded in a White House attack crashed the stock market. New York City’s new
911systemcrashedfourtimesinthefirsttwodaysofoperations.
During this time, several other outages worth covering occurred. Some of these are summarized in this
article.
International Space Station Incommunicado for Three Hours
NASA communicates with the International Space Station (ISS) from Houston via three geosynchronous
communication satellites that transmit voice, data, and video. But on Wednesday morning (EST),
February 20, 2013, something went wrong. The ISS suddenly lost all communication with NASA’s
controllersatitsgroundstations.
Theoutage occurred when NASA was makingaroutineupdate to the space station’s flightcomputers.In
order that normal functions would continue during the upgrade, the computer that controls these
operations failed over to its backup computer. For some reason, the backup system could no longer
communicatewithNASA’sTrackingandDataRelaySatelliteSystem.
Communication was restored about three hours later. During the communication outage, station
commander Colonel Kevin Ford was able to radio the ground as the space station orbited over ground
stations in Russia. He verified that the station and its six astronauts were all safe and that the space
stationwasotherwiseperformingproperly.
Though NASA has not disclosed the reason for the communication outage, it recently launched the new
Tracking and Data Relay Satellite K (TDRS-K) this past January. This was the first upgrade to the
TrackingandDataRelaySatelliteSystemsince2002.
Heat Spike Takes Down Hotmail and Outlook.com for Sixteen Hours
Microsoft has been a leader in operating data centers at warmer temperatures. This strategy can save
significant energy by requiring less use of power-consuming chillers and cooling equipment. The
downsideofthisstrategyisthatitleaveslittleroomtorecoverfromcoolingfailures.
Microsoft experienced this a little after noontime on Tuesday, March 12, 2013, in one of its datacenters.
Microsoft was updating firmware for a part of its physical plant, a procedure it had done several times in
the past. But this time, things went awry. The update failed in an unexpected way and resulted in a rapid
and substantial temperature spike in the datacenter. The spike was significant enough to cause several

servers in the datacenter to shut down as a safeguard. Microsoft is in the middle of transitioning its
Hotmail user base over to its new Outlook.com service. It was the servers that predominantly hosted
HotmailandOutlook.comservicesthatsufferedtheoutages.
The heat spike was so rapid that it prevented any of the datacenter’s infrastructure from executing
automatic failover to an alternate datacenter to continue services. Based on the nature of the failure, a
mix of infrastructure software and human intervention was required to bring the core infrastructure and
the downed servers back online. This extended the time needed to recover the lost Hotmail and
Outlook.comservices.

Microsoft has suffered several cloud outages this year. In January, both Hotmail and Outlook.com
suffered interruptions. Early in February, its Office 365 online software suite and its Outlook.com email-

Seacom Underwater Cables Cut Once Again

A Rat Causes Massive Fukushima Power Outage
The Japanese Fukushima nuclear power plant was hit by an earthquake and tsunami in March, 2011,
causing meltdowns which spewed radiation into the surrounding soil and water. 160,000 residents had to
beevacuatedfromthearea.
The big problem was that the nuclear reactor cooling facilities were shut down by the disaster, causing
the meltdowns. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) has since relied on makeshift equipment to
maintain its fresh-water cooling pools to keep the reactor temperatures safe until all nuclear material can
beremoved,whichmighttakeuptofortyyears.
In late March, 2013, a switchboard short-circuited and disabled four cooling systems. It took technicians
30 hours to repair the system. According to TEPCO, the facility would be safe for at least four days
withoutcoolingwater.
What caused the short circuit that took out the switchboard and the cooling pools? A ten-inch rodent was
found fried and somewhat exploded in the switchboard. TEPCO is taking steps to ensure that animals

Hackers Attack WordPress
WordPress currently powers 64 million websites read monthly by 371 million people. In mid-April, 2013,
WordPress was attacked by a botnet of tens of thousands of individual computers over the period of a
week. The botnet targeted users with the username “admin,” the default username, which unfortunately
manyusersneverchange.
The botnet used over 90,000 IP addresses to avoid being shut down by firewalls and other attack-
mitigationdevices.

WordPress urged users to change their usernames and passwords and to use the two-step
authentication procedure that it had just introduced the prior week. With two-step authentication, a one-
timepasswordissenttoauser’smobilephonewhenheattemptstologin.
One concern is that attacks on major web sites by PC botnets are an attempt to build stronger botnets.
PC botnets have limited capacity to launch a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. By gaining
access to large servers with orders of magnitude more bandwidth, extremely dangerous DDoS botnets
canbebuilt.1
American Airlines Cancels or Delays 2,000 Flights

morning of Tuesday, April 16, 2013, the airlines lost access to their computer systems that do everything
from issuing boarding passes to determining how much fuel a plane needs. The result was the

American, which is merging with US Airways to become the world’s largest carrier, could only apologize
to the tens of thousands of stranded passengers as the airline worked through the problem. Passengers
waited in long lines, shouted at the overstressed agents, and exploded their frustrations on social media.

Power Outage Costs Sears $2.2 Million
In June of 2013, Sears Holdings Corp. filed a lawsuit against its power-equipment vendors for two power
failuresinJanuarythatSearssayscostitUSD$2.2millioninprofitsandanotherUSD$2.8milliontofix.
The problems began on January 3, 2013, during the busy season just after the holidays. One of its four
uninterruptable power supplies (UPS) failed. This was followed by the failure of the other three UPS
systems. This was followed by the failure of its backup power facility, totally shutting down power to its
maindatacenteranddisablingitsretailwebsite.
It took five hours for Sears to start its backup generators and to bring its datacenter back online.
According to Sears, this cost it USD $1.58 million in profit. It then had to run the datacenter on backup
generatorsforeightdays,costingitanotherUSD$189,000indieselfuel.
Unfortunately, one of Sears’ power-equipment maintenance vendors reset a circuit breaker for testing
purposes after the first failure and did not return it to its proper setting. This caused a second outage on
January 24th. Three of the four UPS units failed, shutting down the datacenter until Sears could fire up its

profit. In addition, a generator ultimately failed; and Sears had to rent another one for USD $ 13,500 per
week.

Summary
During these last few months, outages were caused by a wide range of problems. Interestingly, over half
of them were environmental. Some were power and cooling problems, but others were unimaginable – a

These incidents emphasize the need for a thorough, well-documented, and well-practiced business
continuity plan that is independent of the causes of outages. You may think that you have all of your
