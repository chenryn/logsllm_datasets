###  Extended Outage

Yesterday, February 8th, at 12:30PM PT Instapaper suffered from an
outage that has extended through this morning.

After spending multiple hours on the phone with our cloud service
provider, it appears we hit a system limit for our hosted database
that's preventing new articles from being saved. At this time, our only
option is to export all data from our old database and import it into a
new one. We expect the service to be fully recovered today, February
9.

We pride ourselves on being a reliable service with minimal downtime (we
were up for 99.93% of 2016), and know many of you rely on Instapaper
every day. We apologize that this issue has resulted in an extended
period of downtime.

We assure you we haven't lost any data. While you may not have been able
to save articles during the outage, anything you've already saved to
Instapaper is safe. We appreciate your patience while we work diligently
to get it resolved.
