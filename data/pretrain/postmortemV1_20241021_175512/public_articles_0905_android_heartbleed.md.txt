Heartbleed Attacks Androids
May2014
Heartbleed is a notorious Internet vulnerability that was introduced in 2012, but it only
came to light recently. It allows a malicious attacker to steal data from a device in an
undetectablewayasitsbrowserisused.
Heartbleed has had tremendous media exposure, and most people now know about it. If you are one of
those and have taken the precaution of upgrading your browser and changing all your passwords, you
maythink that youarenow safe.However,if you are anAndroiduser,think again.Thereis along wayto
go to make Android devices safe from Heartbleed. Though you may have received Google’s patch to
correct the vulnerabilityin your Android operating system, you maybe running several apps that open up
yourdevicetoaHeartbleedattack.
What Is Heartbleed?
We described the Heartbleed vulnerability in our last issue of the Availability Digest.1 To recap,
Heartbleed is a flaw in the open-source OpenSSL (Open Secure Sockets Layer) cryptographic software
libraryusedtoprovidecommunicationsecurityovertheinternetviaencryption.
Heartbleed allows hackers to bypass the OpenSSL protection. Attackers can read portions of memoryof
a protected device. This memory may include the private keys used by OpenSSL for public/private key
encryptionaswellasusernamesandpasswordsthatmaybestoredontheaffecteddevice. Withallofits
malicious actions, Heartbleed leaves no traces. There is no log activity that records its intrusion. It is
virtuallyimpossibletodetect.
The OpenSSL flaw that opened the Heartbleed vulnerability was a missing bounds check in handling
heartbeats.Heartbeats wereaddedtoOpenSSLinversion1.0.1,whichwasreleasedonMarch14,2012.
The intent of the heartbeat was to test and keep alive secure communication links without the need to
renegotiatetheconnection.
Either side can send a heartbeat to the other side, and the initiator expects a copy of its heartbeat in
response. The heartbeat is an arbitrary text string, up to 64K bytes in length, and a 16-bit integer
indicatingthelengthofthetextstring.Forinstance,theheartbeatmessagemightbe“bird,4.”
Unfortunately, the flawed heartbeat logic in OpenSSL did not check the text message against the
indicated length (the missing bounds check). If the initiator of the heartbeat sent a heartbeat comprising
“bird,64K,”itwouldreceivethetext“bird”followedby64Kbytes(lessfourbytes)ofthefollowingcontents
ofmemory.

Since the memoryblock returned as aheartbeatresponse was takenfrom dynamicallyallocated memory
that had been returned to the memory pool, each heartbeat typically received a different block of old
memory that contained different information. Each block of memory could then be mined for information
nuggets. Because the blocks were typically dynamically allocated memory used by OpenSSL, blocks
oftencontaineddatasuchasprivatekeys,usernames,andpasswords.
Affectedversions of OpenSSLare versions 1.0.1to 1.0.1f.Versions 1.0.0andearlier and versions 1.0.1g

Android and Heartbleed
Android versions 4.1.0and 4.1.1(releasedin2012) containtheHeartbleed vulnerability. About20% of all
Android phones use these versions of the operating system (mostly version 4.1.1). Consequently, about
50 million Android phones worldwide may be vulnerable. People using these versions should avoid
sensitive transactions because their data may be compromised. Opening a malicious website as a result
of a phishing email may allow a hacker to take advantage of the Heartbleed bug to steal data from the
phone.
GooglehasreleasedapatchtotheAndroidoperatingsystem tocorrectthevulnerability.However,itmay
take some time for this patch to reach phones in the field as updates must come from the smartphone
manufacturers and wireless carriers. They typically make updates only every few months, so protecting
theflawedAndroidphonesmaytakesometime.
Android Apps and Heartbleed
But this not the end of the story. Just because the Android operating system has been patched does not
mean that a phone’s vulnerability has been corrected. This is because the vulnerability also exists in a
myriadofAndroidapps–eventhoseavailablethroughGoogle’sGooglePlayappstore.
Android apps frequently use native libraries, which either directly or indirectly leverage vulnerable
OpenSSL libraries. Though developers have corrected many of their apps, many more continue to carry
theflaw.Thecorrectionstosomemaybelongincoming,ifever.Forinstance,manyappsuseembedded

Security firm FireEye2 scanned 54,000 Google Play apps, each with over 100,000 downloads, and
determined that 220 million of these downloads contained the Heartbleed vulnerability. No patches are
yet available for these apps. Many of these were business apps, making the risk of sensitive data loss
even greater. It is quite likely that many 4.1.0 and 4.1.1 Android users who now feel protected are still
opentoaHeartbleedattack.
Detecting Heartbleed Vulnerability

scanning – they were only adware. FireEye found only two apps that were effective. Unfortunately, they

the phone’s browser accesses Salesforce.com and
Facebook.com. Neither of these web sites are
vulnerable to Heartbleed. Rather, the bleeding is
betweenthephoneandamaliciousserver.
Lacoon also has posted another video to YouTube
showing the detection and protection of an Android
phone against a Heartbleed exploitation using their
mitigation product MobileFortress.4 MobileFortress
includes a gatewayto inhibit heartbeats until the phone
is free of vulnerabilities. With no heartbeats, no data
will be stolen. The only impact is that connections will

Summary
Heartbleed has been one of the worst vulnerabilities ever to hit the Internet because it easily steals data
fromserversandclientdevices.Itissotransparentthatittook twoyearstoexpose.Mostservershaveby
now been corrected. However, millions of Android phones are still vulnerable to data loss from malicious
servers because the Heartbleed flaw is contained in thousands of Android apps. It may take a long time
to correct all of these apps and to render the phones invulnerable to Heartbleed. Some vulnerable apps
mayneverbedetectedorcorrected.
Apple states that it does not use the vulnerable version of OpenSSL in its iPhones or iPads. Microsoft
saysthatitsWindowsPhonesanditsWindowsoperatingsystem arenotaffected.ThisincludesWindows

aMicrosoftstatement:
"Even though Windows XP is no longer supported by Microsoft and is past the time we normally
