U-2 Spy Plane Crashes FAA Computer
May2014
OnApril30,2014,theair-trafficcontrolcomputersatthebusyLosAngeles,California,Air
Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) suddenly went down, paralyzing air traffic across
the U.S. Southwest. After some denials, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) finally admitted
that a U-2 spy plane operating within the area at high altitude caused a software problem that took down
the computers. It took almost an hour to restore the computers to service and several hours to clear up
backloggedtraffic.
The U-2 Dragon Lady
The U-2, nicknamed the “Dragon Lady,” is a single-
seat airplane that can fly above 70,000 feet for high-
altitude reconnaissance. Conceived in the early 1950s
as a surveillance aircraft that could evade detection by
the Soviet Union, it went into operation in 1955. The
U.S. believed that the limit of the Soviet Union’s radar
was 65,000 feet, so flights at 70,000 feet and above
wouldgoundetected.
Unfortunately for the U.S., the Soviet’s improved their
radar andcouldtrack U-2flights. Usinga surface-to-air
missile, theyshot down a U-2 in 1960 that was flying a
CIA mission. Pilot Gary Powers was captured; and
much of the plane was recovered, giving the Soviet’s a
great deal of information about the U.S. capability for high-altitude surveillance, including detailed high-
resolution photos takenbyPowers. This was a major embarrassmentfor President Eisenhower, who had
assuredNikitaKhrushchevthattheU.S.wasnotconductingspymissionflightsovertheSovietUnion.
After 60 years of service, the U-2 is still being used by NASA for civilian purposes and by the U.S. Air
Force.TheplanesawserviceinboththeAfghanistanandIraqiwars.
It is believed that the Air Force is planning on decommissioning the U-2’s, perhaps replacing them with

The ERAM System
TheU.S.air-trafficcontrolsystem is old.Itis builtontheradar andradiotechnologies of the1950s;andit
is becoming increasingly difficult for it to handle today’s air traffic, which is expected to double or triple
over the next one to two decades. It is written in obsolete languages, it is difficult to upgrade, and

So what is the FAA doing about this? Its answer is NextGen – the next generation air-traffic control
system. NextGen is a transformation of the entire U.S. national air transportation system. It replaces
legacy ground-based navigation (radar, navigation aids) and ground/air voice communication with GPS
positioninganddigitalcommunication.
An important component of NextGen is a system called En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM).
ERAM is tasked with specifically keeping planes from colliding with each other, whether they be large
commercialairlinersorsmallgeneralaviationaircraft.
Unfortunately, ERAM’s deployment has been plagued with development problems, software bugs, cost
overruns, and schedule slips. The (now) USD $2.4 billion system, whose development started in 2002,
was supposed to have been installed in the twenty ARTCC facilities in the U.S. by 2010. A 2012 audit
report by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Office of Inspector General found numerous examples
of software problems and determined that the project was well behind schedule and way over budget. It
blamedpoorcontractandprojectmanagementforthebulkoftheproblems.
ERAM is now partially installed in sixteen of the twenty ARTCC facilities, but it is not fully operational in
anyofthem.ItsnewlyscheduledfulldeploymentisAugust,2014;butthisdateisunlikelytobemet.
Nevertheless, controllers say that ERAM is a vast improvement over past systems and is needed to

The U-2’s Flight into the LA ARTCC Air Space
On Wednesday, April 30, 2014, the Air Force filed an FAA flight plan for a U-2 flight within the Los
Angeles ARTCC area. Flight plans are required for any operations within controlled air space in the U.S.,
and this flight plan was like any other. (Outside of controlled air space, in good weather, planes –
especiallysmallgeneralaviationairplanes–canflyVFRwithoutaflightplan.VFR,orVisualFlightRules,
requires thatthepilotberesponsiblefor avoidingcollisions.Thereis noair-trafficcontroller monitoringhis
flight).
There were two differences in the U-2 flight
plan from a normal flight plan. One difference
was that it specified a very complex route,
flying in and out of the ARTCC area several
times. Most flight plans are for simple point-to-
point routes, flying to a destination airport or
from a departure airport within the ARTCC, or
for a straight path through the ARTCC air
space.
The other difference was that apparently the
flight plan did not include an altitude. To
compensate for this, an air-traffic controller
entered an arbitrary altitude of 60,000 feet,
typical for a U-2 flight and miles above any
otherairtraffic.
The Software Bug

primarysystem failed, behaved in the same way. It took a few days, but finallythe FAA admitted that the
problemwascausedbytheU-2flight.
For whatever reason, the Los Angeles ERAM system apparently became confused about the altitude at
which the U-2 was flying. One conjecture is that the plane’s transponder, which sends information about
the plane’s position, including its altitude, to the ARTCC system was faulty and was sending erroneous
altitude information. Furthermore, it may not have been flying at the arbitrary altitude of 60,000 feet that
wasmanuallyenteredbythecontroller.
Notknowing the altitudeof theU-2flight,the ERAMsystem hadtoanalyze theroutes of everyflightinits
area as compared to the flight path of the U-2 and to redirect those flights so that they would not collide
with the U-2 (even though the U-2 was, in fact, miles above all of the other flights). This was a level of
activity not envisioned in the design of the ERAM; and it evidently ran out of memory, causing it to shut
downandrestart.Whenthebackupsystemtriedtotakeover,itsufferedthesameconsequences.
Ittook FAAspecialists almostan hour toreconfigure the ERAM to allow it to resumeits normalfunctions.
In the meantime, hundreds of flights were cancelled or delayed. Over a period of time, the FAA issued
severalexplanatorystatements:
“FAA technical specialists resolved the specific issue that triggered the problem on Wednesday, and
the FAA has put in place mitigation measures as engineers complete development of software
changes. TheFAA willfullyanalyze theeventtoresolve anyunderlyingissues thatcontributed to the
incidentandpreventareoccurrence.”
“The computer system interpreted the flight as a more typical low-altitude operation and began
processingitforaroutebelow10,000feet.”
“Theextensivenumberofroutingsthatwouldhavebeenrequiredtode-conflicttheaircraftwithlower-
altitude flights used a large amount of available memory and interrupted the computer’s other flight-
processingfunctions.”
“The FAA … has enabled facilities that use the computer system to significantly increase the amount
of flight-processing memory available. The FAA is confident these steps will prevent a reoccurrence
ofthisspecificproblemandotherpotentialsimilarissuesgoingforward.”
The Impact on Air Traffic
The impact of the outage in such busy airspace was wide-spread. Hundreds of flights around the country
were canceled, delayed, or rerouted. Flights originating within the Los Angeles ARTCC were grounded,
as were any other flights destined for airports within the ARTCC. All in all, fiftyflights were cancelled and
almost 500 flights were rerouted or delayed. Major airports within the ARTCC that were affected included
LosAngles,SanDiego,andLasVegas.
During the outage, air-traffic controllers had to use slips of paper and telephones to relay information
aboutplanes toother controllers andtoother air-trafficcontrolcenters.Amajor causeof disruptionis that
when air traffic control has to revert to a compromised mode of operation, the minimum separation
between airplanes is increased from one mile to five miles. Furthermore, even though planes are
identified on the controllers’ display screens by four-digit codes transmitted by the planes’ transponders,
aircraft must periodically report their positions as they pass over designated reporting points to eliminate
any confusion. They may be directed to hold at these points until the air space in front of them can be
cleared. These procedures greatly reduce the achievable flow of air traffic through the controlled air
space.

Summary
The failure of the Los Angeles ARTCC due to a U-2 overflight was caused by a software error in the
ERAM system. Developed by Lockheed (the company that also developed the U-2), software bugs such
as this are an indication of inadequate testing of the software during its development. This conclusion is
supported by the facts set forth in the Inspector General’s report described earlier. Software bugs are a
leadingfactorinthemultiyearscheduleslipoftheERAMsystem.
