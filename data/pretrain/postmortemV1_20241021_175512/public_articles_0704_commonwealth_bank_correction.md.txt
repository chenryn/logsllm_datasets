Inarecentissue,wereviewedaseries ofoutagesbeingexperiencedbyAustralia’slargestbanksasthey
engage in multi-year replacements of their aging legacy systems.1 The “big four” Australian banks -
National Australia Bank (NAB), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), the Australia and New Zealand
Bank (ANZ), and Westpac - have all had their shares of outages affecting ATMs, retailers’ POS devices,
andonlinebanking.
In response to the article, one of our subscribers informed us that we had made an error in our reporting
ofoneofCommonwealthBank’soutages,anerrorthatwewouldliketocorrect.
Our Story
WedescribedtheMarch,2011,Commonwealthoutageasfollows:
Commonwealth Bank customers found on March 1, 2011, that they could not transfer funds or pay
billsonline.RetailPOSmachineswereaffected,andscheduledpaymentsweredelayed.
However, … cash from the bank’s ATMs was plentiful – too plentiful for some.The technical problem
forced Commonwealth to take its ATMs offline. Its ATMs could still dispense cash, logging the
transactions locally in the ATM. Since there was no check of a customer’s account balance,
customers found that they could withdraw any amount by simply visiting several of the bank’s ATMs.
Word of this bonanza quickly spread, and there were reports of people queuing up at the bank’s
ATMstotakeadvantageofthesituation.
Once service was restored and the ATM logs processed, the bank realized that some customers had
systematically and deliberately set out to withdraw money that wasn’t theirs. It froze or closed the
accounts of those customers, including many on welfare, and threatened legal action to recover the
“stolen”funds.

Our Subscriber’s Response
Theresponsefromoursubscriberwasasfollows:
I am discouraged to read these words, as they do not express the reality of the situation, and gloss
overthemanagementproblemsrevealed.
I have fairly close knowledge of how the CBA's various ATM and EFT systems interact. At no time
were the ATM's themselves ever "off-line". The CONNEX Advantage switch, running on dual
Tandems,was onlinetotheATM's,andonlinetothe bank's EFT system calledCTS,butoff-linefrom
thebank'svariousproductsystems.MostoftheirdebitaccountsarenowprocessedinSAP.
Theissuewas thatCTSwasstandinginforSAP,butnotusingabalancefile,morea"readonlydaily
limit" figure per card, which resulted in the cash being plentiful. CONNEX did and does have
balances, but the CBA did not see fit to use them until much later in the outage. Definitely, CONNEX
wasloggingallATMtransactionsduringthistime.
The Correction
The eFunds CONNEX Advantage system runs on dual HP NonStop servers and provides a complete set
of services for the processing, switching, authorization, and settlement of automated teller machine
(ATM),pointofsale(POS),ande-commercetransactions.Itprovidestransactionprocessinginterfacesto
hostsystems,cardnetworks,andotherfinancialinstitutions.
It appears that Techworld’s statement that “Commonwealth Bank … put all their ATMs into offline mode”
was an oversimplification. According to our subscriber, what happened was that the ATMs were, in fact,
online to the CONNEX Advantage transaction switch, which was in turn online to the bank’s EFT system,
CTS. CTS, however, was offline from the bank’s SAP system, which holds the customer card balances
usedfor authorization.CONNEX onlyhaddailylimitfigures towork with, which inmanycases weremore
than the customers’ account balances. In these cases, customers could withdraw up to the card daily
limits,thusoverdrawingtheiraccounts.
Our apologies to Commonwealth Bank for not having this more detailed explanation of what happened in
thisoutage.Wehopethatthishassettherecordstraight.
