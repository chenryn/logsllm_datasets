Fire Suppressant’s Impact on Hard Disks
February2011
InarecentAvailabilityDigestarticle,1wereportedadata-centerfailureexperiencedbyWestHost,
a major web-hosting provider, that took down almost 100,000 web sites and email accounts for
uptosixdays.
The problem occurred when WestHost’s data center underwent a standard yearly test of its
Inergen fire-suppression system. Unfortunately, a third-party test technician failed to follow the
published pre-testchecklist and did not removeone of the actuators that activates thesystem.At
about2:20PMlocaltime,whenthesystem was rearmedfollowingthetest,the actuator fired and

No one at the time knew why, but hundreds of WestHost disk-storage systems were severely
damaged. WestHost operations immediately came to a halt, and it was days before full service
was restored. To make matters worse, WestHost did not back up its customers’ data offsite.
Rather, they backed it up using virtual tape, storing the backups on disk systems located in the
datacenter.Manyofthesediskswerealsodamaged,andsomedatawasirretrievablylost.
Speculation, of course, circulated around the Inergen gas. Was it the gas itself? Was it the
sudden increase in pressure caused by the release of the gas? Subsequent investigations led to
anunlikelyculprit–noise.
Can Loud Noises Affect Hard Disks?
The disk failures were a totally unexpected event. Normally, when a fire-suppressant system is
triggered,itis inresponsetoafire.Servers andharddisksareexpectedtobedamagedbecause
of heat and smoke damage. But why was there such widespread damage in the absence of a
fire?
Since 2008, occasional reports had surfaced in the fire-safety industry that hard disks had faced
problems when gaseous fire-extinguishing systems were activated. As later reported in the
Availability Digest,2 Siemens, a world leader in fire safety and fire-suppressant systems, decided
toexploretheproblem further.Itsreport3detailedtestsitperformedtodeterminethecauseofthe

system is triggered, not only is there an explosive noise from the sudden release of the gas, but
the sound level from the warning alarms is ear-splitting. According to local codes, dry
extinguishing-system alarms typically have to generate sound levels between 90 and 120
decibels.
Siemenssubjectedharddiskstosuchnoiselevelsandfoundthat,indeed,theperformanceofthe
disk drives was reduced by up to 50%. Temporarymalfunction of the disks and damage to some
sectorswereobserved.
This effect is graphically illustrated in an amusing YouTube video, Shouting in the Data Center,4

The Inergen Team Steps In
Tyco, the manufacturer of Inergen, stepped in with its own exhaustive tests and came to the
same conclusion. Tyco Fire Suppression and Building Products (TFS&BP), in cooperation with a
major IT manufacturer and an acoustics consultant, discharged Inergen gas into an enclosure
containingthirty-fiveoperatinghard disks representing types andmanufacturers typicallyfoundin
data centers. Not only did these tests include various nozzle configurations, but they also
includedtypicalalarms.
Surprisingly, it was not the noise of the gas discharge that was the primary cause of the disk
problems. It was the noise of the alarm sirens! It was determined that sound consisting of high
decibellevelswithhighfrequencycontentcausedthemostdisruptiontothedisks.
TFS&BP also found that the effect on the disks depended upon the quality of the disks. Disks
commonlyreferred to as “enterprise-class disks” were less likelyto be affected than lower quality
disks.TheresultsoftheTFS&BPtestsarepreviewedinapreliminaryreporttoitsInergensystem

Defensive Steps to Minimize Noise Damage
Following are some steps that a data center can take to minimize the potential damage to disks
followingagasdischarge(theyarerecommendationsmadebySiemensandTFS&BP):
 Useenterprise-qualitydisksorsolid-statediskswherepossible.
 Encloseharddisksinnoise-proofedenclosures,andkeepthedoorsclosed.
 Replicatecriticaldatatooffsitediskstorage.
 Position siren and gas nozzle locations so that they do not radiate directly on the disk
drives.
 Muzzlethesirensduringfire-extinguishertests.
 Increase the number and decrease the spacing of suppression nozzles to decrease their
soundlevels.
 Avoidveryshortdischargetimes(lessthan60seconds).

 Use electronic horns instead of pneumatic sirens. The following charts show
TBS&BP test results for these two types of alarms. Electronic horns caused very

 Many codes and standards recommend deenergizing equipment prior to clean-agent
discharge. NFPA 75, Protection of Information Technology Equipment, states that “the
power to all electronic equipment shall be disconnected upon actuation of a gaseous
agent total flooding system …” This will allow the disk drives to “park,” greatly reducing
thechancethatdatawillbelostorthatdiskswillbedamaged.
One other strategy is to consider hypoxic fire-prevention systems,6 which involve no gas
discharge. Rather, they maintain a human-safe atmosphere of reduced oxygen that will not
support combustion. Fires in these environments simply cannot start. However, all the caveats

Summary
Occasional reports have surfaced in the last few years describing damage to hard-disk drives
following a discharge of a gaseous fire-suppression system. Tests by major providers of these
systems have confirmed that such damage can occur and that it is related to extreme noise
generatedduringsuchadischarge.
However, the noise specificallydue to the discharge of gas is not the primaryculprit. The biggest
effect on disk drives is caused by the fire alarms that accompany the discharge. There are
reasonablysimplestepsthatadatacentercantaketominimizethisdamage.
