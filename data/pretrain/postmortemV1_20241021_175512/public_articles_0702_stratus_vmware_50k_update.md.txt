Stratus Puts $50,000 Where Its Mouth Is – An Update
February2012
In our December, 2011, issue, we described Stratus’ $50,000 wager that its servers
will not fail.1 This is the second time in as many years that Stratus has stuck its neck
out with such an offer. Unfortunately, at the time of our article’s publication, Stratus’
latestofferwassoonabouttoexpireasoftheendof2011.
Good news for those considering fault-tolerant industry-standard servers. Stratus has extended its latest
offer for a year. Virtualized Stratus 4500 or 6310 ftServers running VMware’s vSphere that are ordered
anytime in 2012 will be warranted to be failure-free for the first six months of production, or Stratus will

Stratus’ vSphere Guarantee
Stratus is now doing it again but with a slightly different twist – virtualization. Stratus is betting $50,000
that Tier 1 enterprise applications are virtualization-ready and will not fail – provided they are running on

Critical, virtualized applications depend upon an extremely reliable infrastructure on which to run. If a
server goes down, not just one application is lost. All applications running on that server are down until
they can be failed over to another server – a process that can take an hour or more for large, complex
applications.Theimpactofafailedserverisamplifiedmanyfoldinavirtualizedenvironment.

The Stratus ftServer
AchievingSix9sAvailability
We have described the ftServer in some detail in a previous product
review.3 ftServer uses dual modular redundancy to provide plug-and-play
fault tolerance to Windows and Linux applications. To measure the
availability of its servers in the field, Stratus monitors its service incident
reports and updates an Uptime Meter daily, which it displays on its ftServer
homepage.TheUptimeMeterconsistentlyshowsanavailabilityofsix9sor
more(32secondsofdowntimeperyearorless).
ftServerArchitecture
The high availability of the Stratus ftServer product line is achieved by running all applications on dual
processors that are lockstepped at the memory-access level. Should
there be a disagreement between the processors, one of the
processors has suffered a fault. If the faulty processor has detected its
own fault, that processor is taken out of service. Otherwise, each
processor enters a self-test mode; and the processor in error is taken
outofservice.
Each processor contains its own I/O subsystem. In normal operation,
peripheral devices are driven by both I/O subsystems via a multipath connection. However, if an I/O
subsystemdetectsamalfunction,itwillremoveitselffromservice.

Each logical processor is connected to each of the I/O subsystems. In this way, any combination of one

Each logical processor can support two six-core Xeon microprocessors, letting it scale to meet verylarge
processing demands. Furthermore, each processor contains not only its logical microprocessor cores,
memory, and I/O subsystem but also 2.4 terabytes of integrated disks. Thus, each logical processor has

Windows and Linux applications. Any application that can run under Windows or Red Hat Linux on an
industry-standard server can run on an ftServer without modification. The installation and administration
procedures are identical. The user should see no difference except for downtime – and that is the big
difference.
When a new operating system version is about to be released, Stratus engineers do everything that they
can to break it. Stratus engineers claim that they have not yet found a device driver that they could not
break. Faults that involve the operating system are reported back to Microsoft and Red Hat, who make
corrections to eliminate the sources of those failures. Everyone benefits from this effort because it is the

StratusCallHome
All Stratus servers monitor themselves for faults. If a problem of any kind is detected, the system will
automatically call a Stratus support facility (provided customer permission has been granted to do so);
andactionisimmediatelytakentodiagnosetheproblem.
If a component needs to be replaced, Stratus will send the component to the customer’s site. There are
many cases in which the first sign of a problem to the customer is when it receives the replacement part
inthemail.
Virtualization
Virtualization technology allows many virtual machines to run on a single server. Virtualization is an
importanttechniqueforgettingfullutilizationoutoflargeserverfarms.
A problem faced with virtualization technology is that availability becomes far more important. One
particular application may not have a high value and can suffer some downtime without serious
consequence. However, run many of these as virtual machines on a single server, and a server failure
becomesmuchmorecostly.
Stratus has integrated the ftServer with VMware’s vSphere to allow ftServers to host many virtual
Windows and Linux machines in any combination. vSphere sits on top of the ftServer hardware and
supports multiple instances of different guest operating systems running as if they were in their own
physicalservers.
As a result, it is very simple to add a fault-tolerant pool of servers to a virtualized server farm. It is this
integrationofftServerwithVMware’svSpherethatStratusiswageringwillnotfail.
The Fine Print
This guarantee is a bold offer from Stratus. But what about the fine print? It seems that the terms and
conditionsofthewagerarestraightforward.Thetermsincludethefollowingdefinitionsandrequirements:
 Ordersmustbeaccepted byStratus byDecember 31, 2012,andbescheduled for deliverywithin

Summary
Stratus’ fault-tolerant systems change the focus of availability from hardware failures and operating-
system faults to other factors. Application bugs, operator errors, and environmental faults such as power,
cooling,anddata-centerdestructionnowbecomethethingsaboutwhichtomostworry.
Continuous availability is no longer a technological problem. It is an exercise in balancing system cost
with downtime cost. Stratus’ ftServer is an affordable starting point to achieve extreme availabilities.
