The Delta Data Center Fire

data center at its Atlanta headquarters. The fire was the result of a routine scheduled switch for testing

Power is broughtintoDelta’s datacenter from twoseparateutilities throughoppositesides of thebuilding

over to their backups, which were also down due to being unpowered. Servers that did have a power
backup (or were powered by the surviving feed) could not communicate with the servers that failed. This
took down Delta’s entire system. Gone were passenger check in facilities, baggage facilities, websites,
kiosks,airportdisplays,andmyriadsofothercriticalapplications.

Delta Flights are Cancelled or Delayed
Airlines cancel flights for safety reasons when they cannot get access to important computerized
information such as passenger counts, checked baggage, or fueling records. This is the situation Delta
found itself in following the fire. It had no choice but to cancel flights or seriously delay other flights.
Addingtotheproblem was thatthecancellationor delayof someflights leftflight crews andairplanes out
ofpositiontocarryonDelta’snormalscheduleofflights.
Delays of flights were further exacerbated by the fact that manual procedures had to be put in place. For
instance, Delta’s reservation and passenger service systems are built on a 52-year old legacy system
called Deltamatic. This old green-screen legacy application had been outfitted with a modern GUI
interface. When this system came back online, only the old Deltamatic green-screen interface was
operational.Agentswhocouldnotusethisoldinterface(mostofthem)hadtoresorttomanuallychecking

Delta cancelled 2,100 flights over a span of three days. It cancelled 1,000 flights on Monday, the day of
the fire. It cancelled 800 more flights on Tuesday and 300 on Wednesday. An additional 2,400 flights
weredelayed.Thousandsofpassengerssleptontheairportfloorswaitingfortheirflights.
Though the ground stop was lifted at 8:40 AM on Monday, cancellations and delays continued. By 1:30

The Cost to Delta
The system outage is estimated to have cost Delta $150 million USD. It had to issue refunds to
passengers whose flights were cancelled or significantly delayed. It offered $200 vouchers to travelers
delayed bymore than three hours or who were grounded due to cancellations. It waved change fees and
put thousands of travelers up in hotels. It turned to its fleet of private jets to get some of its highest-level
customerstotheirdestinations.
The cost of this outage was extraordinarily high. The average cost of a data center outage, according to
the Ponemon Institute, is about $730,000. This highlights the fact that airlines have a lot more at stake

Summary
Airlines face difficult challenges with their IT systems. They depend upon these systems for all of their
functions, including flight scheduling, passenger check-in and services, baggage handling, fueling, airport
video displays, andmanyothers.However,mostof thesesystems arebasedon legacysystems installed
years ago. Upgrading thesesystems is acomplex task sincenone of these functions can be takenoffline

Nevertheless, airlines must deal with the fact that failures are not exceptions. They are normal. When a
server,adatastore,or anetwork componentfails,their systemsmustbeabletoimmediatelyandreliably
fail over to a backup component. Otherwise, the result is cancellations or delays and millions of dollars in
costs.
