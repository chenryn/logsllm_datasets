Shellshock – The Bash Vulnerability
October2014
A bug in the popular Bash shell used in Linux and Unix operating systems was
discovered at the end of September, 2014. Dubbed ‘Shellshock,’ the flaw has led to a
code-injection vulnerability for applications running under Linux and Unix that use Bash
as the shell. Some analysts are concerned that Shellshock may rival the recent Heartbleed vulnerability,
discoveredlastAprilinOpenSSL.1
The Bash Vulnerability
Bash is a commonly used command interpreter for Unix and Linux systems. It converts typed or scripted
command strings into operating system commands. Bash is a free software replacement for the Bourne
shell.2 Bash was released in 1989, and it has been distributed widely as the shell for the GNU operating
systemandasadefaultshellforLinuxandApple’sMacOSX.
Bash uses Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts to generate dynamic content for web pages and
web applications. The Bash vulnerability is caused by its handling of environmental variables in CGI
scripts. When a script assigns a CGI variable, not only is the specified function executed, but any
malicious trailing code in the function definition also will be executed. Bash takes no precautions to
protectagainsttrailingcode.
This opens the door for code-injection attacks. It is fairly easy to smuggle code into CGI environment
variables, as the CGI scripts are sent over the Internet to display web pages on client systems. The
malicious code can open a back door to welcome sophisticated malware that then can infect an
enterprise’s entire network. CGI scripts, including child processes spawned by the scripts, are all
vulnerable.
The Bash vulnerability was discovered on September 24, 2014, by Stéphane Chazelas, a French IT
manager working for a software maker in Scotland. However, the flaw has been around for twenty-two
years.ItfirstappearedinBashVersion1.13andcontinuesthroughBashVersion4.3.
Notonlyis Shellshock acriticalsecurityrisk toLinux andUnix operating systems,it also is athreat to the
entire Internet because of Bash’s ubiquity among systems connected to the Internet. Even worse is the
“Internet of Things,” in which all kinds of controllable devices are attached to the Internet. Linux is now
being used in cars, calculators, intelligent light bulbs and toasters, and even home wireless routers. It is
doubtless that most intelligent appliances will ever be patched to correct the Bash defect. The Internet of

NIST (the National Institute of Science and Technology) rates the Bash flaw 10 out of 10 in terms of

Comparison to Heartbleed
Many analysts have compared the seriousness of Shellshock to Heartbleed. In fact, the similarities
between them are striking. While Shellshock allows execution of malicious commands that have been
inserted following an environmental variable in a CGI script, Heartbleed allows the reading of
unauthorizeddatafollowingatextstring.
Heartbleed is a flaw in the OpenSSL (Open Secure Sockets Layer) cryptographic software library. The
OpenSSL flaw that created the Heartbleed vulnerability was a missing-bounds check in handling
heartbeats. Heartbeats were added to OpenSSL in Version 1.0.1, which was released on March 14,
2012.Theintentof theheartbeat was totestandkeep alivesecurecommunicationlinks withouttheneed
torenegotiatetheconnection.
Either side can send a heartbeat to the other side, and the initiator expects a copy of its heartbeat in
response. The heartbeat is an arbitrary text string, up to 64K bytes in length, and a 16-bit integer
indicatingthelengthofthetextstring.Forinstance,theheartbeatmessagemightbe“bird,4.”
Unfortunately, the flawed heartbeat logic in OpenSSL did not check the text message against the
indicated length (the missing bounds check). If the heartbeat initiator sent a heartbeat comprising “bird,
64K,” it would receive the text “bird” followed by 64K bytes (less four bytes) of the following contents of
memory.
That chunk of memory can then be mined for information nuggets. Typically, it is dynamically allocated
memory used by OpenSSL and contains data such as private keys, user names, and passwords. Since
thememoryblock returned as aheartbeatresponse is takenfrom dynamicallyallocatedmemorythathas
been returned to the memory pool, each heartbeat usually receives a different block of old memory that
containsdifferentinformation.
