The Cost of Data Breaches
January2016
The theft of data from a company can have many consequences. Customers may leave
and patronize other companies that they consider more secure. Government regulations
maybeviolated.Thedatabreachmayinflictseverecostsonthecompany.
The Ponemon Institute has released its tenth annual study on the cost of data breaches.1 The study was
sponsored byIBM and covers data breaches that occurred in 2014. 350 companies that actuallysuffered
a data breach of less than 100,000 records are included in the study (mega-breaches were not included
inthestudyastheytendtoskewtheresults).
The cost of data breaches continues to rise. The average total cost of a data breach increased to $3.79
million,2 up 23% since 2013. The average cost per breached record increased to $154, a 12% increase
since2013.
There is a growing concern among senior executives and boards of directors about the risks posed by
data breaches and cyberattacks, including potential damage to a corporation’s reputation, class action
lawsuits, and costlymitigation. As a consequence, executives are paying greater attention to the security
practicesoftheircorporationsinordertothwartdatabreaches.
Participating Companies
The companies that were involved in the study were located the United States, United Kingdom,
Germany, Australia, France, Brazil, Japan, Italy, India, Canada, and the Arabian region (United Arab
Emirates andSaudiArabia).Allparticipatingorganizations experiencedadatabreachrangingfrom 2,200
records to 101,000 records. A compromised record is one that identifies the individual whose information

Reasons for Higher Data-Breach Costs

 Cyberattacks have increased in frequency and in remediation costs. Malicious or criminal attacks

 The consequences of lost business are having a greater cost impact. This cost includes the
abnormal turnover of customers, increased customer-acquisition activities, reputation losses, and
diminished goodwill. The growing awareness of identity theft has contributed to the increase in
lostbusiness.
 Costs associated with detection and mitigation have increased. These costs include forensic and
investigative activities, assessment and audit services, crisis-team management, notification of
thoseaffected,andcommunicationstoseniorexecutivesandboardsofdirectors.
Main Causes of a Data Breach
Therearethreemaincausesofadatabreach.
 47% of data breaches are caused by malicious or criminal attacks. The most common types of
malicious or criminal attacks include criminal insiders, malware infections, phishing/social
engineering,andSQLinjection.Theseattacksarealsothemostexpensiveonaper-recordbasis.
The average cost per record compromised in such an attack is $170. Cost ranges from $230 in
theU.S.to$71inIndia.
 29% of data breaches result from system glitches at an average cost of $142 per breached
record.Costsrangefrom$210intheU.S.to$45inIndia.
 25% of data breaches are caused by human error, typically due to carelessness. Such a breach
carries an average cost of $137 per breached record. Costs range from $201 in Germany ($198
intheU.S.)to$49inIndia.

Data Breach Costs by Industry
The Ponemon study included sixteen industries. Those with the highest data-breach costs were Health
($363),Education($300),Pharmaceuticals($220),Financial($215),andCommunications($179).
Time to Identify and Contain a Data Breach
Surprisingly, it takes a significant amount of time for a company to discover a data breach. This is
because most of the time the data breach is noticed first by a third party, such as a bank that suddenly
sees a raft of fraudulent purchases on its credit cards. It can then take some time for the data breach to
becontained.
MeanTimetoIdentify(MTTI)
In the survey sample, the average time that it took to identify a data breach (MTTI) was 206 days. The
maximum amountof timeinthesurveysampletoidentifyadatabreachwas 582days (over a year anda
half!).
The root cause of the data breach was a factor in the MTTI. For a malicious or criminal attack, the MTTI
was256days.Forasystemglitch,itwas173days.Forahumanerror,itwas158days.
MeanTimetoContain(MTTC)
Once the data breach was identified, the average timeto contain it (MTTC) was 69 days. For a malicious
or criminal attack, the MTTC was 82 days. For a system glitch, the MTTC was 60 days. For a human
error,theMTTCwas57days.

MajorCostComponentsofaDataBreach
Therearefourmajorcostcomponentsofadatabreach:
 Lost Business has the most severe financial consequences. This category includes the abnormal
loss of customers due to a data breach, increased customer-acquisition activities, reputation
losses, and diminished goodwill. Lost business contributes $1.57 million to the cost of a data
breach.
 Detection and Escalation activities add $0.99 million to the cost of a data breach. Detection
includes activities that enable a company to detect the breach of data at rest or in motion.
Escalation involves activities necessary to report the breach to appropriate personnel. These
activities include forensic and investigative activities, assessment and audit services, crisis-team
management,andcommunicationstoexecutivemanagementandtheboardofdirectors.
 Notification activities inform affected people or companies of the data breach. These activities
include the creation of contact databases, determination of all regulatory requirements,
engagement of outside experts, postal expenditures, secondary contacts to email or email
bounce-backs, and inbound communications. Notification activities represent the lowest data-
breachcostcomponent,adding$0.17milliontothecostofadatabreach.
 Post Data-Breach activities help victims of a breach to communicate with the company to ask
additional questions or to obtain recommendations in order to minimize potential harm. These
activities contribute $1.07 million to the cost of a data breach. Post data-breach costs include
help-desk activities, inbound communications, special investigative activities, remediation, legal
expenditures,productdiscounts,identityprotectionservices,andregulatoryinterventions.
BestPracticestoReduceCosts
Thefollowingbestpracticescanreducethecostofadatabreach:
 Maintain an incident response team that can immediatelytake actions to limit the effect of a data
breach.
 Useencryptionfordata-at-restanddata-in-flight.
 Train employees on how to properly handle sensitive data and to avoid phishing attacks or other
social-mediaincursions.
 Haveawell-thought-outBusinessContinuityManagement(BCM)plan,andinvolveallemployees

TheImpactofaBusinessContinuityManagementPlan
The Ponemon report focuses on the advantages of using a good BCM plan. The survey results indicated
that a BCM plan reduced the per-record cost of a breach from $161 to $147 and reduced the total
average cost of a data breach by $500,000, from $4 million to $3.5 million. It reduced the likelihood of a
databreachform28%to21%.

Probability of a Data Breach
Based on its study, the Ponemon Institute has generated an algorithm that it believes will predict the
probabilitythat a data breach will occur in the next 24 months.The algorithm is based on two factors: the
sizeofthedatabreachandthecountry.Itappliestocompaniesthatalreadyhavehadadatabreach.
According to its algorithm, the probability of a company experiencing a data breach involving a minimum
of 10,000 records in the next 24 months is estimated to be 22%. The probability of a data breach
involving100,000recordsinthenext24monthsislessthan1%.
This should be a wakeup call to executives whose companies have experienced a data breach to be on
thelookoutforanothersmalldatabreach.
So far as countries are concerned, companies in Brazil are most likely to experience a data breach of at
least 10,000 records (37%). Companies in the U.S. have a 22% probability of experiencing such a data
