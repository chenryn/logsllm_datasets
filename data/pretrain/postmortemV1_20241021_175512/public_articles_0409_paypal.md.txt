PayPal Fault Takes Merchants Offline
September2009
Shopping with PayPal
PayPal is the world’s largest online payment service. By including a small PayPal HTML snippet
into his web site, a merchant can effortlessly accept customer payments using a variety of credit
cardssuchasVisa,MasterCard,AmericanExpress,Discoverandothers.
Of ever increasing popularity is the PayPal account. A customer can deposit funds into his own
PayPal account and use these to make online purchases. Whether a purchase is made with a
credit card or with a PayPal account, a merchant receives instant payment via a deposit into his
ownbankaccountorintohisPayPalaccount.

and 75 of the top 500 online retailers such as Wal-Mart. 205 of the top 500 online merchants

PayPal was founded eleven years ago and was acquired by EBay, the online auction firm in
2002. EBay, facing increasing competition from Amazon.com and coping with weakening

PayPal and its sister payment service, Bill Me Later (acquired by EBay in 2008), account for a
third of EBay’s revenue and a sixth of its profits. With over 75 million users, these companies
currently handle over $16 billion in online commerce per quarter. During normal periods, almost

The PayPal Outage
Clearly, the availabilityof PayPal services is of utmostimportance to its merchant customers. If a
merchant depends upon PayPal for all of its payment services – credit cards and PayPal
accounts – a PayPal outage can bring that merchant to his knees. A large number of customers
who were denied payment privileges may well go elsewhere, and a merchant could lose
significantrevenueduringanoutage.
PayPal will not take responsibility for such losses. Its terms of service agreement states that
PayPal isn’t liablefor “lost profits or anyspecial, incidentalor consequential damages arising out

of or in connection with our Web site, our service, or this agreement (however arising, including
negligence).”
To meet its obligations, PayPal has had excellent availability over most of its existence. A major
exceptionoccurredin2004whenabotchedsoftwareupgradetook downsomemerchantsforfive
days.Butsincethen,PayPalhashadnearcontinuousavailability.
That is, until Monday, August 3, 2009. At 1:30 PM Eastern Time, an “internal network hardware
issue” crashed the entire PayPal network. No merchant anywhere in the world could conclude a
transaction over PayPal. Customers trying to place online orders were shown a message saying
thattheirorderscouldnotbeprocessedatthistime.
PayPal customer service representatives quickly notified the major online merchants of the
problem,anditstechnicalstaffscurriedtocorrecttheproblem.Afteranhour,someservices were
restored, but scattered problems appeared for the next four hours. Full service was finally
restoredat6:30PM.
The scope of this problem was greater than any that PayPal had encountered before. There is
no estimate of the amount of business lost by PayPal’s merchant customers during this outage,
but at $8 million an hour, it is likely to be significant. Even worse, many of the affected online

PayPal Isn’t Alone
PayPal is not the only payment service to impose suffering on online merchants. Authorize.net is
a similar company that offers credit-card payment services. With 262,000 customers, it handles
almost$28billionperquarterinpaymentsreflectingoverahalf-billiontransactions.

Authorize.net was down for hours, leaving thousands of merchants with no way to accept
customer payments. Power was restored at about 2 PM, and Authorize,net was able to restore

Lessons Learned
The lesson to be learned from these outages is not a provider lesson; it is a user lesson.
Databases are not the only things that need to be backed up. Critical services also need to be
backedup.
Those merchants that relied solely on a single payment provider felt the pain. While PayPal or
Authorize.net were down, their stores were idle. Those that had a contingency plan in place
hardlynoticedtheimpactontheiroperations.
One retailer, Sports Giant, uses Yahoo to host its web site. When PayPal shut down, Sports
Giant simply accepted customer credit card requests blindly. It notified Yahoo to pass all
customer payment information to the customer service department of Sports Giant. There, the
payment information was held until PayPal services were restored, at which time the payment
information was submitted to PayPal. Sport Giant”s exposure? An occasional invalid credit card
payment.

FansEdge, number 217 in the top 500 online retailer list, took contingency planning one step
further. It developed systems that accept orders when payment processing fails and that then
resubmitthepaymentinformationwhenpaymentprocessingreturns.
Another technique would beto not putall ones eggs inonebasket.For instance, PayPal Pro can
be used to establish a merchant account so that the merchant can deal directly with the credit
card payers. PayPal can be used for payments via PayPal accounts. However, payments using
other credit cards go directly to the credit card issuer for authorization. Should PayPal go down,
atleasttheothercreditcardsarestillactive.
Contingency planning such as this should be applied to every critical service that cannot be lost
forhours.Evenifthecontingencyplanismanualbackupwithmanualre-entryoftransactions,the
plan should be well-documented, tested and rehearsed so that operations will continue
