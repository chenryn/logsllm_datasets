DualDatabaseFailures

subsystem. The chance that a pair of mirrored disks will fail is one-in-a-million if each has an
availability of three 9s. A dual SAN, each with four 9s availability, is one hundred times more
reliable.Yetsuchfailureshappen.Woetotheenterprisethathasn’tbackedupitsdatabaseifthis
highly unlikely event should happen. It has lost both its production database and its replicated
copy.
American Eagle, a multibillion dollar clothing retailer, experienced just this fault. In July, 2010, its
web site came crashing down when its primary SAN failed.5 As it attempted a failover to its
backup system, the unthinkable happened. Its standby SAN crashed. No problem – American
Eagle attempted a failover to its remote DR system only to find that its outsourcer, IBM, had not
yet brought the DR system into operation. Fortunately, it did have magnetic tape backups; but it
tookfour days torestorethe purchasing functions ofthe web site and another four days to get its
ancillaryonlinefacilitiesbackintooperation.
More often than not, a dual-storage outage is due to a maintenance error. DBS Bank, the largest
bank in Singapore, started getting alert messages from its primary SAN in July, 2010.6 The
support group deduced that it was a cable problem, and a cable replacement was scheduled for
the wee hours of the morning. The local service technician decided that he could probablyfix the
cable and started fiddling with it. The result – he took down the standby SAN as well. Gone were
thebank’sonlineservices,ATMservicesandPOSservices.ThebankwasluckierthanAmerican
Eagle – the database was still intact, and they were able to restore services in ten hours.
Nevertheless,theywerehitwitha$230millionpenaltybytheSingaporeMonetaryAuthority.
The State of Virginia was not so lucky.7In August of 2010, a controller board failed on the state’s
primarySAN.When a maintenance technician started the repair process, he pulled the controller
board from the good SAN by mistake. Fortunately, the database was backed up on magnetic
tape.However,it tookthestateovera weektorebuild thedatabase; and it lostuptofourdaysof

Vehicle Bureau, Social Services, and the Department of Emergency Management just as

Point-in-TimeRestoration
A major advantage of backups is recovering accidental or malicious deletions of files or tables.
With a backup, you can return to some prior point in time and recover a lost or corrupted file or
table.
JournalSpace wasa major bloggingsite.InDecember, 2008, JournalSpacesummarilyfireditsIT
manager for stealing from the company.8 On his way out, the disgruntled employee did a slash
and burn on JournalSpace’s entire SQL database, overwriting it with garbage. Only then did
management discover that the manager had never fulfilled his duties to back up the database.
After exhausting all options to recover the database, JournalSpace went out of business the next
month.

Archiving
Backups are the only way to archive information for long-term storage. This is often required by

ProtectingDataThatIsNotProtectedbyReplication
Data replication doesn’t always protect everything. Often, to make the most efficient use of
processing and network capacity, only that data that is deemed critical is replicated. There is no
standby copy of the less critical data, though it is important to the smooth operation of the
enterprise.
Do you know what data is replicated and what is not? As new applications are added, do you
keeptrackoftheprotectionofthatdata?
The only safe way to protect all data is to back it up periodically so that it can be recovered
followingitsloss.

PeaceofMind
Finally, there is peace of mind. As one person told me, no matter how safe he feels with
replication, he does not want to have to stand in front of the Board of Directors and explain how
helostthecompany’sdata.
Backing Up – Magnetic Tape or Virtual Tape?
So backup is imperative. There is great risk to your data and to your company if you do not
performperiodicbackups.
But what kind of backup? We have seen from some of the above stories that even when
companies backed up their databases on magnetic tape, it could take them days to restore
operations following a major failure. Virtual tape improves recovery time significantly, typically
reducing recovery time from days to hours. It also improves reliabilityof backup since there is no
concernaboutlost orunreadabletapes.Inaddition,sincebackups canbemade morefrequently,
theamountofdatalostcanbereducedfromdaystohours.
Magnetic tape does have a role, though, and that is long-term storage. Maintaining backup tape
images on disk is typically valuable only for a limited amount of time. Depending upon the
application needs, that time may be months or more. There comes a point when the need to
rapidly access backed-up data for point-in-time restoration or for audit purposes loses its value.
Atthattime,olddatashouldbemovedtomagnetictapetosavemoneyandenergy.
A recent study by The Clipper Group9 has concluded that in a typical long-term archiving
scenario, a disk archive will cost about 23 times as much as a tape archive and will burn 290
times as much energy. If a virtual tape library with a 20:1 deduplication factor is used, disk
archivingwillstillcostaboutfivetimesthatoftapebackup.
What About the Cloud?
Cloud computing is the new paradigm today. Many cloud providers offer storage services in the
cloud. The advantage of using cloud storage is that there are no operational worries – just pay
thebill.
Unfortunately, cloud storage has yet to be proven a reliable backup medium. We read every
couple of months about some cloud storage provider that has lost part or all of the data it is
holding.10 Unless you can reconstruct your data somehow, be aware of the cloud – it can be

Summary
Data replication does not protect data. It protects system operations. Should a system fail, rapid
recovery can be made to a standby system with a current application database that has been

However, if the production database gets corrupted, or if a file or table is lost, data replication
provides no protection. If there is a simultaneous failure of both the production and standby
databases,datareplicationprovidesnoprotection.Onlybackupprovidesthisprotection.
Therefore, the database must be backed up. Near-termbackups should be kept on disk for rapid
