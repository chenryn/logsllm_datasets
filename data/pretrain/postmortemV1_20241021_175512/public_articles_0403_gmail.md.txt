Has Gmail Become Gfail?
March2009
Gmail is a highly popular free email service offered by Google. It is the third most popular email
service (after Yahoo! and Hotmail) with about 100 million subscribers. Gmail launched in April,
2004, as an invitation-only beta release and became available to the general public in February,
2007.
Gmail’s business model is advertising instead of user subscription fees. Gmail scans incoming
emailandpoststextualadvertisingmessagesrelatedtotheemail’scontent.
In January, 2009, Google added an experimental offline email feature that allows users to read
and respond offline to email that they previously downloaded. Gmail will resynchronize when the

messaging, and office productivity services. Google offers ad-free Apps Premier for a
subscription price of $50 per user account. Apps Premier carries a service-level agreement in
which Google agrees to give its customers credits if it does not meet a monthly availability of
99.9% (72 minutes of downtime per month). This SLA does not apply to Gmail or Google Apps

Google’s Miserable Gmail Availability History
Some might say, “You get what you pay for.” This certainly has not been the experience with
Googleingeneral,thoughGoogledeclaredtheentireInternetasmalwareforan hour onJanuary
31, 2009.1 Google’s search engine has by itself made the Worldwide Web immensely useful to
all.
However,Google’sGmailhasnotliveduptothisstandard.Overthelasteightmonths,Gmailhas
experiencedsixsignificantoutages:
 July16,2008–Usersreceiveda“502servererror”messagewhentheytriedtologin.
 August 6, 2008 – An outage locked out Gmail users and Google Apps customers for 15
hours.
 August 11, 2008 – A problem with Google’s “contacts system” caused Gmail access to
go offline for a “couple of hours.” Individual accounts and Google Apps customers were
againaffected.
 August 15, 2008 – An outage once again locked out some users for a day, returning the

 February 24, 2009 – The topic of this article, a two and a half hour outage again affected
almostallGmailandAppsPremiercustomers.
Though Google claims an availability of its Gmail services of 99.9%, or three 9s availability, the
above experience would indicate an availability of 99% or so over eight months, about ten times
worse.Thelasttimewesawapersistenttwo9savailabilitywasintheearlydays oftransistorized

Gmail’s Latest Outage
Google’slatestGmailoutageoccurredonTuesday,February24.Itstartedaround9:30AMGMT,
and lasted for two and a half hours until noontime GMT. Users trying to login to Gmail received
the onerous “502 server error” message. For users in the U.K. and Europe, this was the worst
time for an outage as it was the beginning of their work day. For users in North America, most
werestillinbed whentheservice wentoutand weresavedthefrustrationofnotbeingabletoget
ontoemail.
This was the first time that Gmail was down since Google had announced offline email support
the previous month. Users who had started to use Google’s offline email services could read
whatever emails they had previously downloaded; and they could prepare responses to those
emails.However,theresponsescouldnotbesentuntilGmailwasbackonline.

The news of the outage spread rapidly over Twitter. The term “Gfail” soon rose into the top
Twittersearchterms.
Google later explained that the cause was a new feature that they had installed to keep email
geographicallyclose its owner.During the maintenanceof one of their European datacenters, its
traffic was routed to another nearby data center. This inadvertently overloaded that data center,

Google’s Apology
Google apologized for the outage and noted in blogs that it shared the pain since its staff uses
Gmailaswell.

month that availability falls below 99.9% but is above 99%, a customer will receive a credit of
threedays.Ifavailabilityfallsbelow99%,acreditoffifteendaysisgiveninstead.
The two and a half hour outage resulted in an availability in February of 99.6%, qualifying Apps
Premier customers to get a three-day credit. However, Google granted the higher credit – fifteen
days–asafurtherapology.
At $50 per year per user account, a three-day credit amounts to $0.41 per user. A fifteen-day
credit is the equivalent of $2.05 per user account. This may not seem much when compared to
the cost of the inconvenience to the users and to the users’ companies. However, note that if
Gmail availability should fall below 99% every month of the year, Google will sacrifice 50% of its
AppsPremierrevenue.

Google’s Superb User Communication
A common thread in our Never Again stories is that web site providers are often notoriously poor
at keeping their users informed when their sites go down. This has led to some serious customer
backlashes.
Onthecontrary,Google workedveryhardviablogsandits websitetokeepusersinformedasto
the status of the outage and, eventually, the cause of the outage. When the problem first
occurred,Googlepostedthefollowingmessage:
“We’re aware of a problem with Gmail affecting a small subset of users. The affected users
are unable to access Gmail.We will provide an update by February 24, 2009, 6:30 AM PST,
detailing when we expect to resolve the problem. Please note that this resolution time is an
estimateandmaychange.”
Asitturnedout,itwasnota“smallsubsetofusers;”buttheproblemwasresolvedby4AMPST.
AsubsequentGmailpoststated:
“If you’ve tried to access your Gmail account today, you are probably aware by now that
we’re having some problems. Shortly after 9:30 AM GMT, our monitoring systems alerted us
that Gmail consumer and business accounts worldwide could not get access to their email.
We’re working very hard to solve the problem, and we’re really sorry for the inconvenience.
ThoseusersintheUSandUKwhohaveenabledGmailofflinethroughGmailLabsshouldbe
able to access their Inbox, although they won’t be able to send or receive emails. We’re
posting updates to the Gmail Help Centre … Thanks for bearing with us while we sort this
out.We’llreportbackaswemakeprogress.”
Most important, in response to this extended outage, Google launched the very next day its
GoogleAppsStatusDashboard,2whichshowsthestatusofeachcomponentofGoogleApps.

The 6:55 PM post provides a link to a detailed incident report. Going to the incident report, we
findGoogle’sdescriptionoftheincident:3
“Google’s software is designed to allow maintenance work tobe done in datacenters without
affecting users. User traffic that could potentially be impacted by a maintenance event is
directed towards another instance of the service. On Tuesday, February 24, 2009, an
unexpected service disruption occurred during a routine maintenance event in a data center.
Inthisparticularcase,usersweredirectedtowards analternatedatacenterinpreparationfor
the maintenance tasks; but the new software that optimizes the location of user data had the
unexpected side effect of triggering a latent bug in the Gmail code. The bug caused the
destination data center to become overloaded when users were directed to it and which in

 In recognition of the fact that Google has no maintenance window, innovate on the
technology and process fronts to make its systems as self-healing and as self-managing
aspossible.
 Proactively communicate with customers when outages do occur. This drove the

Lessons Learned
TherearemanythingsthatGoogledoescorrectlytominimizeorcontaintheeffectsofanoutage:
 Its data centers back each other up. In the event of either planned or unplanned
downtime,user services canbe quicklyandseamlesslyswitched tosurvivingcenters.As
reported in many of our Never Again articles, this does not seem to be a standard
practiceyetincloudcomputing.
 Google makes great efforts to communicate frequently and effectively with its customers,
including being forthright in explaining the reasons for its outages. Its launching of the
AppsStatusDashboardisanexcellentexampleofthiseffort.
Google’s outage frequency is aggravated by its rapid and continual introduction of new features
and newservices. However,it is gratifyingto seethe supportthat users providetoGoogle during
these crises, as evidenced by the blog traffic that sprang up in response to this outage. We
