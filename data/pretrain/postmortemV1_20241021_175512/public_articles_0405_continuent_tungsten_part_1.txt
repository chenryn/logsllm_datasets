Master/Slave Replication with Continuent’s Tungsten
May2009
The Tungsten replication engine from Continuent, Inc. (www.continuent.com), provides
asynchronous heterogeneous replication between MySQL and Oracle
databases. Tungsten is open-source and is also available in an
enterpriseeditionsupportedbyContinuent.
In a previous paper entitled “Scaling MySQL with Continuent’s uni/cluster,” we discussed
Continuent’s uni/cluster, a two-node active/active system. The two nodes are LAN-connected,
and each node connects to one or more MySQL database servers. The MySQL databases are
keptsynchronized bysynchronous replication.Reads arespreadbetweenthe MySQLdatabases
for scaling. Should a node fail, all transactions are automatically routed to the surviving node.

In this article, we review Continuent’s Tungsten asynchronous-replication engine, which provides
master/slave replication between MySQL and Oracle databases as well as to other JDBC-
compliantdatabases.
Tungsten Replicator
The Tungsten Replicator provides asynchronous master/slave replication between off-the-shelf
SQLdatabasesrunningoncommodityhardware.
TungstenMaster/SlaveReplication
In a master/slave configuration, one master
database replicates its updates to one or more
slave
slave databases. The master database is
DBMS
available to all applications, and all updates
updates master read
are made to the master database. The slave DBMS only
systems are available for read-only
slave
applications such as queries, reports, and
DBMS
backups.
Master/SlaveReplication
Master/slave configurations bring many
advantagestoanapplication:
 Availability - High availability can be achieved since a slave can be promoted to master
statusshouldthemasterdatabasefail.
 Scaling–Readscanbespreadacrossmanyslavecopiesofthedatabase.
 DataLocality–Databasecopiescanbelocatedatremoteclustersofusers.

 Disaster Recovery – A current copy of the database can be maintained at a remote site

 Change Data Capture – Changes to independent databases can be fed to a centralized
database,suchasadatawarehouse,forenterprise-widedataconsolidation.
 Cross-SiteClustering–Applicationprocessingcanbedistributedtomultiplesitesforload

 Zero-Downtime Upgrades – Upgrades maybe rolled through the system without denying
accesstousers.
Tungsten supports asynchronous master/slave replication. As changes are made to the master
database, they are replicated to the slave database copies. Replication may either be via SQL
statements or via rows. In addition to inserts, updates, and deletes, Tungsten also supports
schemachanges,storedprocedures,views,andtriggers.
MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL databases are supported as master databases. They and any
other JDBC-compliant databases may be mixed in a master/slave configuration as slave
databases.
Architecture
TheTungstenreplicationenginecomprises anExtractor andanApplier.As changes aremadeto
the master database, a record of those changes is entered into a change log of some sort. For
Oracle databases, this is the Redo Log maintained by Oracle for transaction integrity. For
MySQL,itisthebinarylogthatcontainsallSQLstatementsthatmodifythedatabase.

TungstenReplicationEngine
The Extractor at the master database reads changes made to the master database from the
change log and writes them to Tungsten’s transaction history log. These changes are then sent
over the communication channel to each slave, where they are written to the slaves’ transaction
history logs. At each slave is an Applier that reads the changes from its transaction history log
andappliesthechangestotheslavedatabase.
The transaction history logs provide persistent storage for replication events for recovery in the
eventofafailure.

Both the Extractor and the Applier support pluggable modules to support any target entity. The
Tungsten Replicator supports any JDBC-compliant database. Continuent has certified Oracle,
MySQL, and PostgreSQL, as master databases. It has also certified these databases along with
SQLServerandDB2asslavedatabases.Inaddition,modulesmaybewrittentoreplicatedatato

The replication engine can provide incremental consistency checks to validate that the slave
databases are, in fact, consistent with the master database without stopping the applications or
withoutstoppingdatareplication.
The Tungsten Replicator runs on commodity hardware. It can be installed on any system that
supports Java. Continuent has currently certified Tungsten for the Linux and Windows operating
systems.
TungstenStack
Tungsten is organized as a stack comprising layers that interact to provide replication and
master/slaveclustermanagement.ThemodulesinthestackarelargelywritteninJava.Thestack
includes:

TungstenConnector
The Tungsten Connector is an optional proxy for MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. It allows
applications to connect transparently to Tungsten master/slave clusters. It provides load
balancing of read requests against multiple slave databases. Should a database fail, it provides
transparent failover without session loss to a surviving database if necessary. MySQL and
PostgreSQL clients can connect without changing libraries as the Tungsten Connector provides
aninterfacethatisidenticaltothatprovidedbythenativedatabase.

SQLRouter
TheSQLRouter isanoptionalmodulethatisresponsiblefortheproperroutingofrequeststothe

requests to the best database, master or slave, based on a quality of service specification. It
handles load balancing and capacity expansion, and it supports failover from a failed master to a
promotedslave.

TungstenManager
TheTungstenManagerhandlesthepoliciesforfailoverfollowingadatabasefault. Itmonitorsthe
systems in the cluster by using Hedera group communications to implement cluster membership
andtoprovidedistributedmessagingbetweenservicesrunningondifferenthosts.
Should Tungsten Manager determine that the master database has failed, it promotes one of the
slave databases to be the new master and notifies the other slaves of the role switch. Failover is
executed with a single manual command. Failover can be automated by integrating the failover
commandwithaclustermanager.
Hedera
Hedera provides a group communications facility to exchange messages between processes
within a cluster. Group communication is needed to support replicated databases, where the
replicasaremanagedbydifferentdatabasecontrollers.
Bristlecone
Bristlecone provides tools for testing database performance. It can generate mixed loads of
inserts, updates, and deletes. Benchmark test cases can be run with systematically varying
parameters. It is useful for quantifying read and write scaling, replication latency, and transaction
throughput.

 Continuentprovidestechnicalsupportandmaintenance.
HeterogeneousSupport
The open-source version of Tungsten is aimed at replication between MySQL and PostgreSQL
databases. By using Continuent’s supported Tungsten Enterprise edition, Oracle replication is
added and allows heterogeneous replication between MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle
databases.AllOracleeditionsaresupported,includingExpress,SE,andEE.
With this capability, the master database may be MySQL, Oracle, or PostgreSQL. If Oracle is
used, Tungsten uses the Oracle Redo Log reader to read changes from the Oracle Redo Log.
Since the Redo Log reader runs only under Linux, an Oracle master must run on a Linux
platform.
In addition to the master databases, all of which may also be slaves, Continuent has certified
SQLServerandDB2asslavedatabases.
