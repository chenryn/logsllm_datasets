Mizuho Bank Down for Ten Days
June2011
This is a story of poor Business Contingency Planning. The Japanese bank, Mizuho Bank
(www.mizuhobank.co.jp), shut down its ATM network and stopped making salary transfers to its
customersinmid-March,2011.Itwastendaysbeforethebankwasbackinfulloperation.
What caused this disaster? A nice thing, actually. It was excessive donations made via mobile
phones in response to the devastating Japanese earthquake and ensuing tsunamis the week
prior. However, the massive load created bythe donations hobbled Mizuho’s batch processing of
money-transfer transactions. As well-intentioned as these donations were, it was little solace to
the millions of Japanese who could not get their salaries paid or who could not withdraw
necessaryfundsfromtheiraccountsviaATMsfordays.
Mizuho Bank
Mizuho Bank is the third largest bank in Japan. It has 440 branch
offices and operates 38,000 ATMs throughout Japan. It is focused on
providing a wide range of banking services to individuals and to small
businesses.
Mizuho Bank came about as a merger of three banks in 2002. Its IT problems started almost
immediately. Each of the three banks had a different computer system – IBM, Hitachi, and
Fujitsu. Indecision as to how to consolidate these systems led to a banking outage almost as
severeas thecurrentone. 2.5millionpublic-utilityautomatic payments weredelayed.As aresult,
Japan’s regulatory watchdog, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), imposed administrative
sanctionsonMizuhoBank.
The Outage
BankingServicesLost
Shades of 2002.Things startedtogo wrongonMonday, March14th, whenbank customersfound
that they were not getting their salary payments transferred into their accounts and that many of
the bank’s ATMs were inoperable. The ATMs were all returned to service by Thursday, March
17th. Then on Friday, March 18th, all of the bank’s 38,000 ATMs stopped working. A customer
who didn’t get his salary payment could not even get moneyfrom an ATM managed by the bank
in order to buy food and to pay bills. This was just before a long weekend ending with the
JapaneseholidaycelebratingVernalEquinoxDay.

To help provide service to its customers, the bank kept its branches open through the weekend
and the holiday. There were even reports that in typical Japanese style, bank employees were

Inside the bank’s back offices, things were even worse. Because of failures of the nightly batch
runs,hundredsofthousandsofmoney-transfertransactions worthalmostatrillionyen(about$10
billion U.S.) could not be processed. This included salary payments that were to have been
transferredintocustomeraccounts.
OntheTuesdayafter theholiday,thebank’s 3500 ATMs in its branch offices opened.Therestof
the ATM network was restored over the next two days. At this time, all money transfers were
finallybeingmadeontime.
ThePubliclyStatedReason
Publicly, the bank initially blamed excessive deposit activity. It later tied the activity to an
extremely large volume of donations to disaster funds set up after the devastating Japanese
earthquake and ensuing tsunamis that occurred the previous week on March 10th. The donations
were made by mobile phone and through ATMs. Each donation resulted in a money-transfer
transactionthathadtobeprocessedduringthebank’snightlybatchrun.
TheentireATMoutagewasfurther aggravatedbythe bankingcommunity’s practiceof turningoff
some ATMs to conserve power in the wake of the destruction of three of the country’s nuclear
reactorsduetotsunamiflooding.
How Did This Happen?
The bank undertook an intensive investigation into the causes of the outage and the steps to be
taken to ensure against such a disaster in the future. In an unusual display of transparency, the
bank publishedinMayadetailedaccount1oftheeventsthatledtotheoutageofits IT services.It
pointed the blame directly at itself and listed many changes that it would make so that such a
fiascowouldnothappenagain.
DonationsOverwhelmedBatchProcessing
Theproblem startedduringthedayofMonday,March14th,whendonations werefirstsolicitedfor
the earthquake relief funds. The earthquake had just hit Japan the previous Thursday. The
Japanese respondedoverwhelmingly, makingdonations from their mobilephones viatheir online
banking accounts. This activity presented no problem during the day, but it led to a mass of
money-transfertransactionsthathadtobeprocessedthatevening.
The bank processes money transfers that had occurred during the dayin an overnight batch run.
The result of the batch run is transmitted as transaction files to the participant banks and is used
to update the bank’s own accounts before its branch offices open. The batch run on this Monday
evening proceeded as usual until suddenly, the batch run failed. The abnormal termination of the
batchrunmeantthatitcouldnotbecompletedbeforethebranchofficesopenedthatmorning.

RevertingtoManualMode
The bank’s systems are designed to handle the evening batch processing and the daily branch-
and online banking support as alternate processing functions. The systems cannot do both
simultaneously. Therefore, the processing of the previous day’s money transfers had to proceed
using manual procedures so that the branches could open. The massive number of manual
operations resulted in many human errors that slowed down processing even further. The result
wasthatMondaynight’sbatchrunwasnotcompletedbythetimethattheTuesdayeveningbatch
runwassupposedtocommence.
Tuesdaynight, the batch runs were attempted again; but once again theyterminated abnormally.
The bank was forced to revert again to manual processing but was unable to come anywhere
near to catching up. By the time branches opened Wednesday morning, almost one million
money-transfer transactions worth almost one trillion yen (about $10 billion U.S.) had yet to be
processed.
The batch-processing problems continued through Wednesday night and were not solved until
Thursday morning. The bank’s IT staff finally realized that each batch run had violated the “data
ceiling” of the batch run’s capability. Simply stated, there were simply too many transactions for
thebatchruntohandle.Whenithititsdataceiling,thebatchrunabnormallyterminated.
TheSlowRecovery
The bank realized that it could not catch up unless it throttled the rate of new money-transfer
transactions. It therefore decided to close down all of its 38,000 ATMs over the long weekend
stretching from Friday, March 18th, to Tuesday, March 22nd. Over this period of time, the bank

By Tuesday morning, it thought that it had completely caught up. However, it then discovered
another 160,000 transactions that were left to be processed. They were processed before the
opening of its branches on Wednesday, March 23rd. Another 1,000 straggler transactions were
found and were cleared by Thursday morning. The bank was now finally caught up and back to
normaloperation.Ithadbeenovertendayssincethebank’stroublesbegan.

The bank is taking aggressive steps to correct these and other deficiencies. In addition, it is
consolidating its three main banking functions under one executive officer. These functions are
currentlymanagedbythreedifferentexecutiveofficers.
The bank is still using the same computer systems that it has used for almost a decade since its
formation in 2002. It is accelerating the development of its next-generation IT systems and plans
to have them completed by the end of the 2012 fiscal year. It plans to have all of its component
systemsrunninginthenewenvironmentbytheendofthe2015fiscalyear.
Lessons Learned
This outage is an excellent example of the penalties of inadequate Business Contingency
Planning.MizuhoBank clearlydidnottakethis task seriously.TheRisk Analysis was incomplete,
and procedural documentation was in error or nonexistent. Contingency procedures were
unaudited.Thebankprobablydidlittleifanytestingofitscontingencyplan.
Proper business contingency planning can be time-consuming and expensive. But it probably
carries much less cost than a two-week outage. The same applies to proper documentation and
operator training.Inthis case,simplyensuringthatthe system operators wereawareof thebatch
dataceilingwouldhavepreventedthisdisaster.
