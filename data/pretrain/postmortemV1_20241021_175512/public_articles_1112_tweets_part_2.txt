but is overly simplistic. Anexamination of today’s digital leadersshows that their infrastructure
strategies are substantially more complex. They typically involve a hybrid mix of legacy
environments, private and public clouds (as well as the use of colocation facilities and managed
services); more than one public cloud at the infrastructure, platform or applications layer; and a
spectrum of computing resources ranging from centralized hyperscale cloud data center
infrastructure to its polar opposite, the fog, i.e., a highly dispersed edge, being driven by the Internet

TheInternetofThingsLeavesFinlandCold
The residents of two apartment buildings in the city of Lappeenranta in Finland found themselves
bundling up at home when the heat in the buildings shut down. The reason for the failure wasn't an
accident — it was a days-long distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack primarily usingInternet of

Who is to blame for the 21 October attack on managed domain name service Dyn? The elephant in
the room is that this probably shouldn't have happened. At the very least, there's a lot to learn
already about the frailty of the Internet DNS system and the lack of failsafes and backups for

IndianCIOsbankondisasterrecovery
A recent Ovum/Zerto Asia Pacific Survey interviewed 400 Asia-Pacific enterprises, and the research
points at massive growth in the disaster recovery market. “The findings of this report show that no
company is immune to a potential outage or disaster; and in the event this does strike, the first few
minutes are critical to recovering as quickly as possible,” said Andrew Martin, managing director,
Asia-Pacific and Japan, Zerto. CIO India takes a look at what the Indian CIOs are doing to protect

Digest Mng Ed. Bill Highleyman presents "Recent Developments in Improving Mission-Critical
System Availability"
Research on making mission-critical systems more reliable continues with some surprising
developments. In this talk, we first review the classic theory behind minimizing the probability that
both nodes of a HA system will fail simultaneously. Weextend this theoryby examining nodal failure
probability distributions and show that by staggering the nodal starting times so that failure
probability distributions are uncorrelated, the probability of a dual node failure and resulting system
losscanbegreatlyreduced.Thisstrategyappliesbothtohardwarefailuresandtosoftwarefailures.

FromtheAvailabilityDigest:High Availability,1970sStyle
In 1972, Digest Managing Editor Dr. Bill Highleyman started MiniData Services, Inc., a payroll
processing company. To service MiniData’s thousands of customers, Dr. Bill and his team
purchased two modern,top-of-the-line minicomputers– PDP-8sfrom Digital EquipmentCorporation.
Each PDP-8 had 4K (yes, kilos) of memory, and each system processed different payrolls.
Additional 4K memory banks could be added. If one PDP-8 failed (and the MiniData PDP-8s never
did), the companywas confident that theycould move the customers off the failed system and could
process all the payrolls on the surviving system. Back in the day, such confidence was all that
constituted the concept of high availability. There was no data replication and no active/backup or
active/active configurations. “High Availability, 1970s Style” is Dr. Bill’s own account of how his
MiniData team operated a successful payroll company with mere kilos of memory, no operating
system,andsoftwaredevelopedin-house.
