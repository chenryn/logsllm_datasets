NonStop Boot Camp Is Coming in October
August2012
It’s been several years since the HP NonStop community has had an opportunity to gather together in a
dedicated setting. The time is coming again. Connect, The HP Business Technology User Group, has
announced the Connect NonStop Advanced Technical Boot Camp, to be held Sunday, October 14th,
throughTuesday,October 16th,2012.TheBootCampwilltakeplaceattheSanJoseDoubletreeHotel,a
largeconferencefacilitythatisafreeshuttleridefromtheSanJoseairport.
Modeled after the OpenVMS Boot Camp that has successfully supported the OpenVMS community for
years, the three-day session of the NonStop Boot Camp will include a preconference day on Sunday
followed by two education days. The education days will include several tracks featuring content
presentedbyHP,customers,andNonStopvendors.
The NonStop Boot Camp is an essential continuation for the NonStop community of HP Discover 2012,
which was held inLas Vegas from June4ththroughJune7th. AtDiscover 2012,attendees learnedallthat
is new in HP’s converged infrastructure initiative. However, Discover 2012 had to cover somuchmaterial
about so many topics that any one particular niche could be given only limited exposure. This is the
purposeoftheNonStopBootCamp–todrilldownintoallthingsNonStop.
The educational opportunities are only some of the reasons for attending the Boot Camp. This is an
opportunity to talk directly with NonStop management and engineering staff who may have been hard to
find(or maynot even have been) atHP Discover. Socialize withother like-mindedNonStop customers to
share your experiences and to find out what they are doing, what are their challenges, and how they are
meeting them. Connect expects about 400 attendees at the Boot Camp, including HP staff, customers,
analysts,vendors,andotherindustryprofessionals.
Also, you can learn about the many new offerings from the NonStop third-party vendors in the partner
pavilion.Andofcourse,lookforwardtotheBootCampreceptionstorelaxandinteractwithallyourpeers.
