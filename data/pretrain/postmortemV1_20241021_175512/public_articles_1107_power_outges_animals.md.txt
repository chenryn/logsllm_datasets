Power Outages Caused by Animals
July2016
In August of 2009, John C. Inglis, Former Deputy Director, National Security Agency,
noted:
"Idon'tthinkparalysis[oftheelectricalgrid]ismorelikelybycyberattackthanbynaturaldisaster.And
franklythenumber-onethreatexperiencedtodatebytheUSelectricalgridissquirrels."
A disturbing number of power outages have been caused by a variety of animals gnawing through high-
voltage wires or falling on transformers or other electrical equipment. It seems that most of these
unfortunatecrittersaresquirrels.However,theyarejoinedbyweasels,monkeys,andevenbirds.
Squirrels
According to CyberSquirrel1, a site that
tracks power outages caused by squirrels,
in a single four-month period in 2013 there
werefiftyreports of squirrel-causedoutages
in 24 U.S. states. In just two days, fifteen
hundred customers in Mason City, Iowa;
1,500 customers in Roanoke, Va.; 5,000
customers in Clackamas County, Ore.; and
10,000 customers in Wichita, Kansas, all
lost power. A month later, there were two
separate outages caused by squirrels
around the small town of Evergreen,
Montana.
During this same time period, squirrels cut power to a regional airport in Virginia, a Veterans Affairs
medical center in Tennessee, a university in Montana, and a Trader Joe’s in South Carolina. Five days
aftertheTraderJoe’s went down,anothersquirrelcutpowerto7,200customersinRock Hill,S.C.,onthe
opposite end of the state. Nine days later, 3,800 more South Carolinians lost power after a squirrel blew

In Portland, Ore., squirrels inconvenienced 9,200 customers on July 1; 3,140 customers on July 23; and
7,400 customers on July 26, 2013. In Kentucky, more than 10,000 people lost power in two separate
squirrel attacks a few days apart. The town of Lynchburg, Va., suffered large-scale attacks on two
consecutiveThursdaysinJune,2013.Theentiredowntownareawentdarkfollowingoneoftheattacks.

Other Animal Attacks
TheLargeHadronCollider
A weasel brought downCERN’s LargeHadronCollider when it chewedthrougha 66-kilovolt power cable
connected to the LHC,1 taking it offline for two weeks. The Large Hadron Collider is the largest machine
ever made by man. It is a superconducting tunnel seventeen miles in diameter straddling the
French/Swissborder.Itisdesignedtosmashsubatomicparticlestogetheratclosetothespeedoflight.

PigeonPoop
In an unexpected act of sabotage, a flock of pigeons in Japan caused a blackout byjust pooping all over
the place. Around three feet of excrement had been allowed to pile up on an electricity substation’s
insulator. The insulator finally shorted, resulting in power being knocked out across the area. Some
25,000 traffic lights lost power because of the bird dung, leaving drivers stuck in traffic. Hundreds of
homesalsolostpower.
FriedChicken
A chicken got into a Maui Electric Co. transformer in the rental car area in Kahului airport in Hawaii. The
chicken caused a power outage that left some passengers having to disembark their planes by mobile
stairway.

RatBlacksOutAberdeenRailStationinScotland
Train passengers were left in the dark after a rat chewed through a power cable and caused a six-
hour station blackout. Engineers found the dead rodent beside the damaged cable at Aberdeen
(Scotland) railway station shortly after the power went out around 9.30 am. Although train services
were not affected, power was not restored until later in the afternoon, leaving the electronic
departuresboardsintheblack.
CrowBlacksOutSanFernandoValley
A crow flew into a 34,500-volt circuit breaker, triggering blackouts throughout the San Fernando Valley in
California, U.S.A. About 15,000 homes and businesses lost power for most of the day, and traffic lights
wentoutoveralargearea.Ittookabouttenhourstorestorepower.
This type of outage is typically restored quickly by switching the circuit to a functioning power bank.

Lessons Learned
Unfortunately, a power substation’s reliability can be compromised by changes in its physical
environment. Plants grow, wildlife populations change, and the topography of the site can erode. These
naturalchanges canleadtoagreater chanceof animalincursions –incursions thatcancauseequipment
failuresandpoweroutages.
The utility should check for overhanging branches or brush growth around the substations that may
