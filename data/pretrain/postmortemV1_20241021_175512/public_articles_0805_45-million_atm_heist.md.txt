The $45 Million ATM Heist
May2013
Perhapsthebiggestfinancialcybercrimeinhistorywascarriedoutearlythis year when“cashiers”around
the world branched out with phony, limitless prepaid debit cards and withdrew USD $40 million from
ATMs in 27 countries in ten hours. Much of this money has not been found, and the brains behind the
operationareyettobeidentified.
The Heist
Theattacksactuallyoccurredattwodifferenttimes.OnDecember 22,2012,thieves stoleUSD $5million
dollars from ATMs worldwide. Then, on February 19, 2013, the thieves struck again and stole another
USD $40 million. It seems that the first attack may have been a dress rehearsal for the second, much
largerattack.
Both attacks used cloned prepaid debit cards whose withdrawal limits had been eliminated or set
extremely high by hackers. This attack is called an “unlimited operation” since there is no limit to the
amount of moneythat may be stolen. Prepaid cards are often used by employers to paytheir employees
or bycharitable groups to distribute disaster assistance. Theyare preloaded with funds rather than being
linkedtoabankaccountoralineofcredit.
Each attack targeted a Middle Eastern Bank that specialized in prepaid cards.. The first bank to be
attacked (in December) was Ras Al-Khmaiah (Rakbank) in the United Emirates. Prepaid MasterCard
debit cards were targeted in this attack. The second bank to be attacked (in February) was the Bank of
MuscatinOman.
In each case, the hackers gained entry into the banks’ systems and eliminated the withdrawal limits on a
set of prepaid cards. They generated PINs for these cards and then texted or emailed the card numbers
andPINstotheir“cashiers”aroundtheworld.
All the cashiers had to do was to record the card number and PIN on any old magnetic-stripe card such
as an expired credit card or even a hotel key. (Magnetic stripe recorders are readily available in the
marketplace.) Then, at the appointed time, they made their rounds of ATMs and withdrew as much cash
astheycould.Theytooktheir20%cutandsenttherestofthemoneytothemastermindsoftheattacks.
During the operation, the masterminds monitored the activities of each cashier during the carefully
coordinated attack through a portal they established to the bank under attack. In this way, they could

In the first attack in December against Rakbank, the thieves withdrew $5 million using 4,500 ATM

Authorities in more than a dozen countries are working with U.S. investigators to uncover the
perpetrators. Though they have not yet identified the masterminds, they believe that they are in Asia or
Europe.However,theinvestigatorshavebeensuccessfulinNewYork City, wheretheyhavearrestedthe

The New York City Cell
EightmembersoftheNewYork Citycellhavebeenarrested.TheyareallU.S.citizensoriginallyfrom the
Dominican Republic. Most are in their early twenties, and all lived in Yonkers, a city north of New York
City.
The ring leader of the NYC cell was Alberto
Yusi Lajud-Pena, 23. He was found murdered
in the Dominican Republic. At the time of his
murder, he had $100,000 in cash with him and
had just deposited $150,000 in twenty-dollar
bills in a Miami bank. One man has been
arrested and has claimed that the murder was

During the December attack, the NYC cell
made 750 ATM transactions from 140 ATMs
and withdrew $400,000 in cash from ATMs in
Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. During the
February robbery, they made over 3,000
withdrawals in ten hours, netting $2.4 million in
cash. The route of one of the cell members is
shownifFigure1.
The members of the cell were at best sloppy.
The cell phone of one of the cell members
contained a photo of him and another cell
member with piles of cash (Figure 2). All of the
cell members were caught on ATM security
camerasandwereidentifiedviadriver’slicense

of pictures of Jose Familia Reyes, 24, showed
his backpack getting ever fuller as he visited
ATMs.
The Security Issues
These attacks have sent ripples through the
security world, not merely for the size of the
operations but also for the ease with which
they were carried out. This modus operandi

has proven successful. It is therefore expected

again,andmoresuchattacksmaybeinstore.
According to Avivah Litan, a Gartner security analyst, Middle Eastern
banks are “a bit behind” on security and screening technologies that are
supposedtopreventthiskindoffraud.
Furthermore, according to the New York Times, payment processing
companies make a more attractive target than banks because they are
typically less secure, and prepaid debit cards are preferable to individual

The first vulnerability appears to be tied to the fragmented system used to connect prepaid debit-card
providers and ensure cash is dispensed to customers. Better oversight could have covered this
vulnerability.Forinstance,theuseofaSIEM(SecurityInformationandEventManagement)system could
have uncovered the unusual activity in a few minutes and closed down the attacks. As it was, the speed
at which the withdrawals were made was such that the financial firms involved did not have enough time
toreactorstopthethieves.
The use of smart cards with embedded chips instead of magnetic stripes could have corrected the
secondvulnerability.Smartcardscouldnothavebeencloned.Unfortunately,becauseofthedependence
of the U.S. market on magnetic stripe cards, this is not likely to happen in the foreseeable future.
However, there is current activity to adapt the EMV (Europay, MasterCard, and Visa) standard for smart
cardsintheU.S.(seeTheJoyofEMVpublishedintheMay/JuneissueofTheConnection).
