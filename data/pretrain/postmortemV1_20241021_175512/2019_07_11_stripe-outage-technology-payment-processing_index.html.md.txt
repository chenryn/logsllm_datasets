# Stripe Outage Smacked Businesses for Two Hours

[Stripe](https://fortune.com/2013/11/21/the-new-power-player-in-online-payments/), one of the most [valuable financial technology startups](https://fortune.com/2018/09/27/stripe-valuation-ipo-stock/) in the world, was hit with one of its
longest periods of downtime ever on Wednesday. The company's services
were offline for almost two hours cumulatively throughout the day,
meaning some [companies that rely on Stripe](https://fortune.com/2016/06/08/stripe-payments-france/) to process payments could not accept
orders during that time.


Stripe was last valued by investors at \$23 billion, and builds software
and payment infrastructure to help businesses accept money online.Â 

"We know that you and millions of other businesses rely on Stripe," the
startup said in a post-mortem on the outage that it plans to publish
Thursday, according to an e-mail reviewed by Bloomberg. "However," it
went on, for about half an hour at about noon New York time, and for
more than an hour after 5 p.m., "the Stripe API was severely degraded. A
fraction of API requests succeeded, but most of them failed."

Tech outages have become commonplace in recent months, with companies like
[Facebook](https://fortune.com/2019/03/14/mystery-14-hour-facebook-outage/), Reddit, and, most recently, Twitter
reporting issues. But because Stripe is used by businesses to make
sales, the downtime can take more of a toll on users.

On [social
media](https://twitter.com/search?q=stripe%20outage&src=typd&lang=en), small businesses complained
about the failure, with one offering discounts to affected customers.
One New York-based startup said it lost roughly \$100,000 in sales
because of the lack of payment processing, some of which it won't be
able to recoup. An executive at the company asked not to be named to
avoid complicating future negotiations with Stripe. The downtime will
also have a financial impact for Stripe itself, which charges a small
fee on payments it processes.


Large companies like Uber Technologies and Amazon also use Stripe, but since they don't rely
solely on the company to process transactions, they didn't experience
the same downtime as small businesses with only one payments platform.
