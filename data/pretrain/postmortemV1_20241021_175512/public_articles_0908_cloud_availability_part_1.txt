Notable instances of public cloud failures and data loss have been frequently reported, and security is a

There is motivation, though, to find a way for critical applications to take advantage of the benefits of
cloud computing. A hybrid approach that assigns critical processing to highly available private systems
such as HP NonStop servers and noncritical processing to the public cloud is a concept that is gaining
momentum. Data replication plays an important role in this approach by providing the ‘glue that binds’

In this article, we discuss the role that data replication solutions can play in public, private, and hybrid-

Cloud Computing
A cloud computing environment comprises a network of compute resources, including CPU, memory,
persistent storage, and communication capacity. These resources are assigned to users of the cloud on
an as-needed basis. If a particular application running in the cloud is suddenly presented with an
increased transaction rate, the cloud infrastructure will assign more resources to it. As the application’s
load decreases, excess resources are returned to the cloud pool. The cloud business model is pay-as-
you-go,meaningauserpaysonlyfortheresourcesactuallyutilized.
The architectural foundation for clouds is virtualized machines (VMs), as shown in Figure 1. A VM is a
virtualized server that runs with other VMs on a single physical host server. A VM comprises a guest
operating system running one or more applications. Supported guest operating systems typically include
Linux,Windows,andsomeUNIXoperatingsystems.

Whenauser decides torunan application,thecloud willcreate a VMrunning on somephysicalserver in
thecloudenvironment.TheguestoperatingsystemtobeusedforthatVMwillbebootedontothatserver,
and the user application will be started. Thereafter, the user’s application runs just as if it had sole
possession of its own physical server – it is unaware that it is sharing resources with other VMs. Except
for theoverallloadsharing of thephysicalresources,theapplications anddatarunning withinthe VMare
isolatedfromallotherVMsrunningonthesamephysicalequipment.
A key point is that the physical representation of a VM is nothing more than a server image stored on
SAN or NAS storage accessible by all physical host servers in the cloud. The server images contain the
executablesfortheguestoperatingsystem usedbytheVMandtheexecutablesforalloftheapplications
that are to be started. This accessibilityprovides a great deal of flexibilityin a cloud. A VM can be moved
from one physical server to another: simply terminate it on the old server and reboot it onto the new
server via its server image on the common storage. This flexibility allows the cloud to move VMs around

its current physical server, it can be moved to another server that has the necessary resources. As that
need dwindles, the VM can be relocated to a server whose resources more closely match its needs. The
resourcesusedbyaVMaremonitoredbythecloudandareusedtobilltheuserforhisactualusage.
There are public clouds, private clouds, and hybrid clouds. A public cloud serves any user who wishes to
subscribe to its services. A private cloud is owned and managed by an organization for its own internal
use. An application running in a hybrid cloud spreads its resource requirements across public and private
clouds or other internal IT infrastructures (for example, an HP NonStop server which is not running as a
partofanycloud).
CloudLock-InandOpenStack
Today’s largepublic clouds includeAmazonWebServices (AWS) andMicrosoftAzure.Theproblem with
these clouds is that they are proprietary. Once a user selects a cloud for their applications, they are
lockedin.Itisverydifficulttomovetoanothercloudprovider.

Amoveis underwaytocorrectthis situation.OpenStack1is anopensourcecloudsuitablefor private and
public clouds.As theOpenStack websiteexplains,OpenStack is a“largescaleopensourcecloudproject
and community established to drive industry standards, end cloud lock-in, and speed adoption of cloud
technologies by service providers, enterprises, and government agencies to build massively scalable
public and private clouds using freely available Apache-licensed software.” OpenStack is patterned after
Amazon’sAWScloud.Itconsistsofthreemajorfacilities,asshowninFigure2.
OpenStack Compute includes VMs to provide compute capacity. Most major hypervisors are
supported, as areWindows, Linux, and some UNIX guest operating systems. An OpenStack VM
can have two IP addresses – one for internal communications and one for external
communications.
OpenStack Storage is a massive block store that provides persistent storage. It is modeled after
Amazon’s Elastic Block Store (EBS).2 Storage assigned to an OpenStack VM does not survive
when the VM is terminated. If the storage must be persistent, it must be directed to OpenStack
Storage.

OpenStack is currently used by the Rackspace cloud and by HP’s CloudSystem Matrix, which allows

explosive growth with companies that are implementing their own clouds. If OpenStack becomes the de-

Integrating a Data Replication Engine with the Cloud
Figure 3 shows a simplified view of a typical data replication engine. The role of the replication engine is

Figure3: ADataReplicationEngine
As the Extractor receives updates,itsends them over acommunication channeltothe Applier resident in
the target environment. There, the Applier applies the data updates to a target database and/or sends
them to target applications. In this way, the target environment is kept synchronized with the source
environment.
In order to be effective in cloud environments, the replication engine must be heterogeneous. The source
andtargetplatformsmaybedifferent,asmaybethesourceandtargetdatabases.Thereplicationengine
must guarantee the transactional integrity of the data it is applying to the target environment. All target
databasesandapplicationsmustbeavailableforapplicationuse(bothreadandwrite)duringreplication.
Replication may be uni-directional or bi-directional (carried out in both directions). With bi-directional
replication, a change to either database is replicated to the other. Thus, an application may be active in
both environments, and the two environments are kept synchronized. A transaction can be sent to either
environment for processing and will achieve the same result. This architecture is known as an
active/activesystem.
DataReplicationintheCloud
As shown in Figure 4, the data replication engine can be integrated into the cloud so that it can transfer

For data transfer from the cloud to an external system, the Extractor is configured to run inside a VM in
the cloud. The cloud-resident Extractor uses the local change queue to collect data from local cloud
applications or databases. In the event-driven push model, the Extractor receives the updates from the

change queue as they are generated and sends them to the Applier on the external system. In the pull
model, the Applier is configured to connect to the Extractor and pull the changes periodically. Regardless
of the model, the Extractor uses the VM’s external IP address to send updates to the Applier located in
the external system. The Applier applies the updates to a target database or sends them to target
applications,asappropriate.
