– Our June Twitter Feed of Outages
June2014
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass.With our new Twitter presence, we don’t
have to feel guilty. This article highlights some of the tweets that made headlines in
recentdays.

IBM'sNewHyperSwapaHeadScratcherforSome
One of the new features that IBM added to its PowerHA suite with the launch of IBM i 7.2 is
HyperSwap. Itallowsa production IBMi LPAR to be moved fromoneDS8700 SANarrayto another
and restarted almost instantly. While HyperSwap protects against the failure of a SAN in a single
data center, its inability to work in a geographically dispersed manner had led some in the IBM i HA

Bandwidthneedsmayputastretchedclusteroutofreach
When it comes to server virtualization, failover clustering is a mechanism for preventing a physical
server failure from resulting in an outage. But what happens if an entire data center fails? Both
Microsoft and VMware offer the ability to fail over VMs to a secondary data center via a stretched
cluster.However,therearefactorsthatyoumustconsiderbeforeyoucanbuildastretchedcluster.

ItOnlyTakesOneBozoToKillYourCloudData
Think all your data is safe and sound in The Cloud? Yesterday, a system administrator at a cloud
service data centre accidentally rebooted every single server at once by accident. The problem
wasn’t just that some system operator pressed the wrong button but that there wasn’t even a “shut it
alldownrightnow”buttoninthefirstplace.

Fat-fingeredadmindownsentireJoyentdatacenter
Cloud operator Joyent went through a major failure when a fat-fingered admin brought down an entire
data center's compute assets. For those not familiar with the cloud, a data center-wide forced reboot on
all servers is just about the worst thing that can happen to a provider aside from the deletion of customer
dataorfrommultipledatacentersgoingdownsimultaneously.

WeNeedtoGetBetteratCoding
Forty seconds after it launched into the skies of French Guiana in 1996, the Ariane 501, an
enormous rocket carrying four satellites, exploded. The catastrophe was caused by a few lines of
faulty code that tried to convert a 64-bit number into a 16-bit memory space (the digital equivalent of
trying to park a semi truck in a broom closet).We rely on code like that in nearly every aspect of our
dailylives.

Australian Web Host Crazy Domains Irretrievably Loses Customer Data, Offering $100 Credit to
Affected Accounts
In May, according to web host Crazy Domains, an “unforeseen incident in a storage upgrade”
resulted in the irretrievable loss of customer data. The company tried to recover the data but
maintains that data backup is the responsibility of the customer. While this may be true and is likely
something in the user agreement’s fine print, it may not be something the less technically savvy
customerwouldbeawareof.
