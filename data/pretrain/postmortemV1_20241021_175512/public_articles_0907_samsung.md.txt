Fire Knocks Out Samsung
July2014
In mid-April, 2014, a fire took down Samsung’s smart-phone, tablet, and Smart TV
services. Its payment services were down. Samsung payment cards could not be
accepted by retailers, and cards were rejected by ATMs. It took more than a day for Samsung to
completelyrestoreservices.

The Fire
Around noon on Sunday, April 20, 2014, a fire broke out on
the fourth floor of Samsung’s backup data center in
Gwacheon. The fire started in a UPS system used to keep
systems running in the event of a power failure until backup
diesel generators could come into service. The fire quickly
spread to the upper floors. Fortunately, no one was killed,

Samsung quickly shut down the servers in its backup data center to minimize damage, to protect data,

Though the fire was in Samsung’s backup data center, it took down Samsung’s web service,
samsung.com, and all of the connectivity to the servers in its Suwon primary data center. Any Samsung

service that depended upon connectivity with its servers was unavailable to users. This included
Samsung smart phones and tablets, Samsung Internet phone service, Samsung Smart TV, Samsung
BluRayplayers,theSamsungAppsMobileStore,andothers.
Perhaps the most serious consequence was that access to Samsung’s servers that ran its payment card
serviceswascutoff.SamsungcardcustomerscouldnotusetheirpaymentcardsatretailersoratATMs.

The Fire’s Impact on Samsung’s Primary Data Center
The fire was in Samsung’s backup data center in Gwacheon. So why were services interrupted? Would
nottheprimarydatacenterinSuwoncontinueinoperationunaffected?
Accordingtoindustryreports,Samsunghadlocatedits networkinginfrastructureinits backupdatacenter
in Gwacheon. This infrastructure was not replicated between Samsung’s primary data center and its
backup data center. Users entered the Samsung online systems via the networking systems in
GwacheonandwereroutedtotheproductionserversinSuwon.
Thus, when the fire damaged the networking infrastructure in Gwacheon, connectivity between the
Internet and the production center in Suwon was lost. No user could access the production servers, and
the backup servers were down. All online Samsung services were lost. These services could not be
restoreduntilthenetworkserviceswerebroughtbackonline.
Lessons Learned
The lesson from this disaster is clear. If mission-critical services are to be supported by redundant
systems,theremustnotbeanysinglepoint-of-failureintheprocessinginfrastructure.InSamsung’scase,
the networking infrastructure should have been implemented in both data centers. If one data center
failed,usertrafficwouldsimplybereroutedtothesurvivingdatacenter.
