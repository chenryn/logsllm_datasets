The Ubiquitous Internet
July2009
In recent articles, we have talked about the fragility of the Internet and of cloud computing.
Companies that depend upon either for critical services must really concern themselves with
backupstrategies.
Internet failures over wide areas have lasted for days.1 Cable breaks caused by a range of
factors, from construction equipment to ship’s anchors, have taken down states and even
countries. Power failures, routing errors, web-site hijacking, chewing rats, sunbursts (affecting
satellitecommunications)andevenvandalismhavewreackedhavocwiththeInternet.
Cloud computing depends upon the availability of the Internet. It also depends upon the
availability of the data centers providing the cloud services, whether they are compute hosting
services or software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. But data centers have been taken down
for days by the failure of backup power systems, upgrades gone wrong, explosions, overloads,
employeemalfeasance,hackers,businessfailures,andevenFBIconfiscation.2
In the face of these horror stories, the Internet thrives. Pingdom (www.pingdom.com) provides a
service to monitor the availability and responsiveness of web sites (you can add your web site to
the Pingdom list). Earlier this year, it published statistics gained from a variety of sources on just

Social Networks
Theneedfor theInternet is gettingfurther fuelingfrom therapid increaseinsocial networking.As
part of its monitoring services, Pingdom has reported on the availability of fifteen of the most
popularsocialnetworks.5
Onlyfive social networking sites achieved an availability of three nines or better (up 99.9% of the
time, or down for no more than eight hours per year). They were Facebook, MySpace,
Classmates.com,Xanga,andImeem.
Friendster suffered one of the longest outages when it was down for 23 hours over a three-day
period in November because of a data-center problem. One-third of the social networking sites
suffered outages of over a day and a half in 2008. A good bit of this downtime was caused by
overloadingduetotherapidincreaseinthenumberofusers.
Social-networkdowntimewasmostnotableforTwitter,whichseemstohaveexplodedpriortothe
U.S. presidential elections and peaked with the untimely death of pop icon Michael Jackson. In
2008, Twitter suffered more downtime than any other social site monitored by Pingdom, though
its performance improved during the second half of the year. For the year, it was down for 84
hours,achievinganuptimeofbarely99%.6
NextbehindTwitterwasLinkedInwith45.8hoursofdowntime.
Summary
The Internet provides important services but on a best-efforts basis. It makes no claim that it will
reliably deliver messages. It just does the best that it can. However, given that, the Internet
provides a high level of service – not telephone quality but more than sufficient for most of the
tasksforwhichitisused.
There is a trend for companies to use the Internet for critical services, initially for email services
but more and more for cloud computing. This should only be done with great caution and with
contingency plans in place to account for the loss of Internet service or cloud data centers,
perhapsfordays.
AgrowingtrendinInternetusageissocialnetworking. Companiesarebeginningtolook tosocial
networking sites such Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn to communicate with their customers. To
interact with customers for marketing purposes is one thing. If social networks are to be used to
communicate critical information such as actions to take in an emergency, this use should be
approachedwithcaution.
