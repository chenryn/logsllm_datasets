Critical Date Testing – Leap Day and More
May2012
As we described in It’s Official! Leap Day Caused the Windows Azure Outage, our companion article in
this issue, Microsoft’s Vice President of Windows Servers and Solutions described in a very transparent
blog why the Windows Azure Cloud went down for a day and a half at the stroke of midnight GMT,
February28,2012.Itwas,infact,aLeapDaybug.
Whenanewvirtualmachine(VM) iscreatedinAzure,theVMgenerates asecuritycertificatethatexpires
in one year. The faulty program accomplished this simply be adding one to the year. Thus, certificates
created on February 29, 2012, expired on February 29, 2013 – an invalid date. This caused physical
servers to be declared unhealthy, and all of their active VMs were moved to other physical servers. None
of these VMs could now come up, and the failure of otherwise healthyservers cascaded through most of
thecloud.
After the immense and largelysuccessful effort expended to protect against the Y2K problem, one would
think that date/timebugs wouldbe athingof the past. Evidently, notso. Azure was not the onlyfatalityof

 A Leap Day bug prevented customers of Australia’s Health Industry Claims and Payments
Service (HICAPS) from paying for their health care services. HICAPS manages 18,500 terminals

 Users of the TomTom automobile GPS devices had to find their own way on Leap Day. Almost a
week later, the Dutch manufacturer of the satellite navigation device determined that the problem

 Some of the lottery games run in Western Canada suffered a minor glitch due to Leap Day.

day.
 Sometimes, things work backwards. Two years ago, several models of Sony PlayStation 3 game
consoles thought that 2010 was a leap year. The bug affected millions of users worldwide and

Among many others, two specific date/time testing products are available for systems that represent a
bulk of mission-critical systems – Opta2000 from TANDsoft for HP NonStop servers and SoftDate from
SoftBase for IBM zOS systems. We briefly review these products as examples of the capabilities of
date/timesimulators.
Opta2000
Opta2000 from TANDsoft (www.tandsoft.com) is a clock and time-zone simulator for HP NonStop
servers. With Opta2000, each application can run under its own virtual system clock with no application
modifications. Thus, applications can be easily tested for proper behavior for future dates. Equally
important, existing production, backup and development systems can support consolidated worldwide
applicationsrunningindifferenttimezones.
No matter the application, the programming language, the system type, or the operating environment, all
timecallsgenerateasystemcalltoanoperatingsystemprocedure.Byinterceptingthesecalls,Opta2000
can manipulate the returned time to meet the simulated time requirements of the application group. For
time-zone simulation, Opta2000 offsets the system’s actual time by an amount expressed as a deviation
from GMT time (Greenwich Mean Time). For clock simulation, the virtual system times can be offset to
whatevertimeisrequiredbytheapplication.
Time simulation services are applied to flexibly defined application groups that can consist of a specified
set of programs, processes, users, and so on. If an application is not defined within any group, it
continuestooperateoffofthenormalsystemtime.
A system can host many application groups, and each group can specify its own time offset. Date/time
offsetsfortheapplicationgroupsareenteredviaacommand-lineinterface.
ClockSimulation
Clock simulation has several uses. For one, the application can be easily tested for critical times. For
instance, to test Leap Day, the application’s clock would be set to just before midnight, February 28th, of
the year to be tested. The application can be tested over and over again to monitor its behaviour as it
transitions the critical time. This testing capability applies both to home-grown applications and to third-
partyapplications.
Another use for clock simulation is to rerun a batch application that failed. The clock can be set to the
timeexpectedbythebatchrun,andthebatchapplicationrerun.
Opta2000 was used successfully in many Y2K testing projects to ensure proper operation as midnight,
December31,1999passed.
Time-ZoneSimulation
With Opta2000’s time-zone simulation, applications can be run on the same system as if they were
located on different systems resident in various time zones. The various transitions between standard
time and daylight savings time for all regions are supported. This allows a company to consolidate the
2

workloads of several geographically dispersed systems onto a single system located in some other
foreigntimezone.
In addition to production environments, time-zone simulation can be used to back up several diverse
systems onto a single system.Though the various systems maybe located in their own time zones, their
backup images can be resident on a single system in some other time zone. Each backup image runs in
asimulatedtimezonethatmatchesthatofitsproductionsystem.
A major Canadian bank used Opta2000 to consolidate three production data centers and DR sites in two
timezones(GMT-5andGMT-8)intoasingleproductionsiteandasingleDRsite.
SoftDate
SoftDate from SoftBase (www.softbase.com) provides time and date simulation services for IBM zOS
systems. SoftDate dynamically front-ends system routines to obtain the correct date and time. The front-
ending occurs only in zOS regions where it is required. SoftDate can be turned on at the individual job
step,TSO,CICS,orIMSuserwithoutimpactingotherjobsorusersinthesamesystem.
SoftDate confines its impact to only those regions and users that actually require it. There is no impact
from SoftDate on regions which are not activelyusing it. There are no permanent changes to anysystem
routines; and any region that is running without SoftDate active will execute only standard, unmodified
systemcode.
Time simulation rules are defined via an intuitive ISPF (Interactive System Productivity Facility) interface.
Thus, there is no need to make JCL changes in order to test time compliance. Notes can be attached to
simulation rules to document them. Comprehensive security controls are provided to prevent time
simulation where it is not intended. Exclusion lists allow users to specify programs that are never to use
SoftDate.
SoftDate’s rules can be assigned to groups of users or applications that can be differentiated by some
combinationof:
 jobname
 stepname
 procedurestepname
 programname
 userID
 subsystemname
 jobclass

Time-zone virtualization of zOS data centers supports data center consolidation. It allows local time to be
presentedtousers who maybe in widelydispersed geographic locations andtimezones.For instance, a
datacenter inNew York maybe hostingapplications for users inLos Angeles,New York,London,Berlin,
and Singapore. Each user will see his correct local time for his own time zone just as if the data center

were located in his city. Specific logical partitions (LPARs) are no longer needed to support branches,
subsidiaries,orcompaniesexistingindifferenttimezones.
SoftDate supports applications running under CICS, TSO, IMS, and WebSphere. CICS MRO (Multi-
Region Operation) support ensures that a transaction started in one zOS region will carry the same time
asitsprocessingtransitionsotherregions.
SoftDate supports Parallel Sysplex systems. Job, CICS, and IMS time simulation rules are synchronized

All 64-bit zOS environments are supported, including support for 64-bit storage above the two gigabyte
bar. 64-bit support is extended to the zOS DB2 10 database management system, including DB2 stored
procedures.

Other Time Simulation Products
There are many other date and time simulation products available in the marketplace. Though
TANDsoft’s Opta2000 is the only time simulator for HP NonStop systems, several others support IBM
mainframesandLinux,Unix,andWindowssystems.Someexamplesare:
 TICTOCfromIBMsupportsavarietyofIBMmainframesincludingzOS,OS/390,CICS,andDB2.
 Time Machine from Solution-Soft supports Windows, Linux, and Unix (HP-UX, Solaris, AIX)
servers.

Time Testing Goes Beyond Y2K and Leap Years
Testing for proper Leap Day functionality is only one of many time-related challenges for application
programmers.Therearemanyothercriticaldatetransitionssuchas:

 clockrolloveratmidnight
Inaddition,manyapplicationshavecriticaldatesthatshouldbetested:
 Policyrenewalandanniversarydates
 Bondandinvestmentfundmaturitydates
 Overduepayments
 Licenseexpiration
All of these cases and many more must be thoroughly tested before an application is deployed. Time
simulation products are a necessary and important tool to ensure that an application will handle
date/time-relatedfunctionsproperly.

Summary
Even with all the Y2K experience, there are still many failures due to date and time bugs. There is no
reason for this. Products are available to thoroughly test applications to ensure that they handle critical
dates and times successfully. These products are by and large noninvasive and require no program
modifications. Simple means are provided to specify date simulation parameters for groups of
applications or users based on a variety of parameters. These products can be used to offset times for
testingortosimulatemultipletimezonesforsystemconsolidation.
Time simulation products exist for most operating system environments, including those for IBM
mainframes,HPNonStopservers,Linux,Windows,andmostUNIXplatforms.
