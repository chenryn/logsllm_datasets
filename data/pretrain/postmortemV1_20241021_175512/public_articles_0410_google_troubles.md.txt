Google Troubles - A Case Study in Cloud Computing
October2009
It’s tough when you’re the big guy on the block. Everybody’s watching, and your missteps are
often reported with glee. Such is the case with Google. Its services are so broad and so popular
thatitisboundtostumbleonceina while,andwhenitdoes itseemstobethetargetofafeeding
frenzyinthepress.
At the risk of joining this feeding frenzy, we look at some of Google’s latest outages over the last
year. Gmail seems to be the Achilles heel, but Google Search, Google News, Google Talk, and
other Google services are not immune. As good as Google is, it is understandably not perfect,

Tuesday, September 1, 2009 – Gmail Down
During the afternoon of September 1, 2009, Gmail went down for over two hours for its million
and a half users. The failure chain began when Google upgraded its routers with the intent of
improvingreliability.Unfortunately,thisupgradeappearedtonegativelyimpactthecapacityofthe
routers–animpactnotimmediatelyrealizedbyGoogle.
But they soon found out, to their chagrin. On that afternoon, Google staff took down several
Gmail routers for maintenance – a common practice done hundreds of times in the past without
incident. What the staff had underestimated was the additional load that this would put on the
remainingroutersastheyroutedGmailtraffic.
The overloaded routers rejected traffic that they could not carry, and this traffic was rerouted
through other routers that then became overloaded. This created a classic cascade of increasing
workloadonfewer andfewer routers.Withinminutes,all of therouters intheGmail network were
overloaded,andGmailcrashed.
It took two hours for Google’s staff to reroute Gmail traffic across the rest of its immense network

Thursday, May 14, 2009 – Google Network Slows to a Crawl
Google Search and Google News slowed to a crawl on May 14, 2009 when 14% of Google’s
network capacity was lost. The outage that took Google offline for millions of users for over an

hour was caused simply by a routing error which affected most of Google’s services including
Gmail,YouTube(ownedbyGoogle),andevenGoogle’swebsite.
Googleexplainedthat thefailure was a result of misdirectedtraffic.Anerror in oneof its systems
caused its network to direct some of its web traffic erroneously through Asia. Many routes

Users across the United States, China, Australia, France, and other countries all reported
problems.
Tuesday, March 10, 2009 – Google Apps Down for 22 Hours
Subscribers for Google Apps were taken down for several hours on Tuesday, March 10, 2009.
Service for many was restored within an hour, but an unlucky subset of users were offline for up
to22hours.1
The problem appeared to be a failover fault. A Google Apps server failed, and its backup in a
remote data center failed to take over. Matthew Glotzback, at the time the Director of Product
Management for Google Enterprise, said in an interview with IDG News Service2 that “[when] we
can’t fail [a] user over for whatever reason – there’s an error with the account, or the master and
theslaveareoutofsync…wecan’trestorethatuser’saccesstotheserviceuntilwerestorethat

Just a week earlier, a Google glitch allowed some Google Apps files to be accessible to
unauthorizedusers.
Tuesday, February 24, 2009 – Gmail Becomes “Gfail”
Gmail was down around the world for two and a half hours on Tuesday, February 24, 2009. This
outageearnedGmailtheinfamousnicknameof“Gfail.”3
Google later explained that the cause was a new feature that they had installed to keep email
geographically close its owner. In preparation for a routine maintenance event at one of their
European data centers, users were routed to another nearby data center. This inadvertently
overloadedthatdatacenter,whichcausedacascadingeffectfromonedatacentertoanother.
Google added actions to its apologies. The very next day, it launched the Google Apps Status
Dashboard. In addition, though its Google Apps Premier customers were due an additional three
days of freeservice under Google’s SLA,Google extended 15 days of additional servicetothese
users.
Tuesday, February 24, 2009 – Google News Out for 14 Hours
On the same day as the “Gfail” outage, Google News went down for about fourteen hours.
Google has not said what caused this outage, and it is not known whether or not it is related to
theGmailproblemswhichalsooccurredonthatday.

January 31, 2009 – Google Declares Entire Internet as Malware
Google works with StopBadware.com, a non-profit project headed by Harvard and Oxford, to
identifysuspicious sites thatexport malware such as viruses and Trojans.Whenever Google lists
such a site in response to a search, it cautions the user with the message, “This site may harm
yourcomputer,”andlinkstheusertoStopBadware.comforfurtherinformation.
On the morning of Saturday, January 31st, Google did a periodic update of its malware site list.
Unfortunately, this update included the URL “/” - a wild card meaning all URLs. Thereafter, for an
hour, every site included in a search result was given the warning message.4 Google dutifully
even labeled itself amalware site. The load on StopBadware.com was so great that it went down
underadenial-of-serviceattack.
October 17, 2008 – Update Takes Down Google Apps
GoogleApps is an SaaS(Softwareas a Service) offeringaimedateasingthemovementof small
businesses to the cloud. A “Start” portal page provides a single sign-on for remote access to a
company’s email, instant messaging, voice, video, calendar, storage, document, intranet, and
collaborativeservicesprovidedbyGoogle.
On Friday, October 17, 2008, Google decided unilaterally and without prior warning to update its
portal pages to look more like its iGoogle personalized home pages following a major upgrade to
iGoogle.Suddenly,linkswerebroken,buttons weremisconfigured,andstrange“gadgets”caused
confusion, preventing access to many Google Apps services. It took days for Google to correct
theproblems.

Google’s New Policy for Transparency
Enterprises using Gmail and other Google services expect communication and transparency
regarding outages. After several of its earlier failures and many complaints by users that Google
was not communicating with them concerning outages, Google intensified its communication
efforts.
Google decided to be very proactive in keeping its users informed about the status of problems
after the “Gfail” outage. The day after that event, on February 25, 2009, Google launched its
GoogleAppsStatusDashboard,whichcanbefoundathttp://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en.
Though the dashboard covers only Google Apps components (Gmail, Calendar, Talk, Sites, and
others), it does not provide information on other services such as Google News. However, for
Google Apps, it notes the daily status of each component and provides information concerning
thestatusofoutagesandotherproblems.
GoogleisnowalsopostingoutageinformationontwoTwitteraccounts.
Google also committed to one-on-one post-mortem discussions with its larger customers
following a problem. Google has been much more open with the press about the reasons for
outages,asisevidencedbysomeofthestoriesabove.
The Premier Apps SLA
Google Apps is a free service. However, support can be obtained by paying for a Google Apps
Premier subscription. With this subscription comes a Service Level Agreement (SLA) that
guarantees99.9%availability.
Three9savailabilityequatesto43minutespermonth.ForeachmonththatGoogleAppsoutages
exceed 43 minutes a month, Google will provide all customers with three extra days of service at
the end of their contract. Should Google Apps not achieve 99% availability within a month (about
7hoursofdowntime),Googlewillgiveanadditional15daysservicetoitscustomersattheendof
theircontracts.
What About Redundancy?
In this dayof high availabilityand continuous availability, redundancyis king.With all of Google’s
problems, one might question the extent of redundancy incorporated into Google’s systems and
networks.
Googleadmits thatitis not fullyredundant.Inits mostrecentquarterly10Q regulatoryreportfiled
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, it states that some of its important data
centersarenotfullyredundant,andthatitfacesrisksfromnetworkissues:
"The availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our
informationtechnologyandcommunicationssystems.Oursystemsarevulnerabletodamage
or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss,
telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other
attempts to harm our systems. … Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our
disasterrecoveryplanningcannotaccountforalleventualities.
"The occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without
adequate notice for financial reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers

could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are
highlytechnicalandcomplexandmaycontainerrorsorvulnerabilities.”
Based on its Google Apps SLA, Google has architected its systems to achieve a 99.9%
availability goal, and it is struggling to achieve this level. It has violated this goal for some subset
of users at a frequency of over once per month (sixteen outages in fifteen months, as reported
above).
An availability goal of four or five 9s (as little as five minutes per year of downtime) would be
warmly welcomed by Google’s subscriber base, But the increase in subscription costs and the
potentiallossoffreeserviceswouldnotbegreetedwithsuchenthusiasm.
There is no question that availability costs money – and perhaps lots of it. Google is striving to
balance cost and availability to maximize its market share, and by all measures it seems to be
achieving that balance. It has shown that there is a mass market in which three 9s, though
perhapspainful,isperfectlyacceptable.
Amazon’s Approach
Amazon is a cloud provider that has taken high availability to heart. Its cloud computing and
storageservices,EC2andS3,aresimilartechnologicallytoGoogle’ssystems.Amazonalsosays
initsSECfilingsthatitssystemsarenotfullyredundant.
However,aftersomeearlydisastrousoutages,includingonethattook downitsownAmazon.com
store for several hours in June of 2008,5 it embraced the redundancy mantra. Amazon now
providesredundancyserviceviaitsAvailabilityZones.6
Amazon divides the world into geographic regions, each containing several Availability Zones. A
customer can select an Availability Zone to launch an instance of his application. He can also
launch a backup instance in another Availability Zone in the same region. The database in the
backup instance is kept synchronized with the primary data database via data replication.

Lessons Learned
Many see cloud computing, in which computing, storage, and application services are available
anywhere,anytime,and at alowcost, as thefuture of computing.This maybe so,but we have a
longwaytogo.
Today, by and large, the cloud is useful for applications that are not mission-critical. If your
application simplycannot be down, it doesn’t belong in the cloud. But as seen by the commercial
successofcloudproviders,thereareamyriadofapplicationsthatbenefitfromcloudcomputing.
However,whensomethinggoeswronginyourcloudvendor’sdatacenterandtheperformanceor
availability of your critical application is compromised, there is little that you can do but wait for

Cloud computing is like any other computing system. If you are to achieve high availability, you
must have redundancy; and failover has to be rapid, reliable, and automatic. For extremely

important applications, you must have some control over your fate. When something goes
wrong with the hardware or software in your cloud vendors' data centers and the
performance and availability of the cloud’s services are affected, you don’t want to be in the
positionthatallyoucandoiswaitfortheproblemtobesolved.
Cloud computing simply provides space, hardware, software, and IT management in someone

At the very least, you should back up your data at an offsite facility. Perhaps you can have your
applications ready to go in another cloud. Perhaps your application data can be replicated from
