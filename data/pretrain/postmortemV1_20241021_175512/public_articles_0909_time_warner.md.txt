TWC Internet Outage Affects Millions
September2014
On Wednesday morning, August 27, 2014, people all over the United States woke up to
find that they had no Internet service. The outage lasted for hours. It turned out that a
human error had taken down the high-speed Internet backbone of Time Warner Cable
(TWC),terminatingInternetserviceformillionsofsubscribersfrom coasttocoast.Thisoutageisbelieved
tobeoneofthelargestInternetoutagestohaveeveroccurredintheUnitedStates.
Time Warner Cable
Time Warner Cable is the second largest cable company in the United
States.ItprovidesInternet,TV,andphonecableservicesto14.5million
of the country’s 115 million homes in 29 states. 11.4 million of these
homes and other businesses subscribe to its high-speed Internet
services.
The presence of Time Warner Cable services is particularly
concentrated in high-density population centers such as New York City
andLosAngeles.
The Outage
A little before 7:30 AM Eastern Time, traffic on social media such as Twitter started to indicate that there
were major Internet outages in California and in the Northeast U.S.
These reports were all from Time Warner Cable subscribers. The
complaints increased in intensity and frustration throughout the
morning. It became clear that the Internet was down in large swaths
of the country – in fact, wherever TWC provided service, primarily in
California,theU.S.Northeast,andTexas.
Frustrated subscribers found that they could not access TWC’s web
site, and TWC’s call center was so overloaded that few telephone
calls were being answered. However,TWC acknowledgedtheoutage
at7:30AMandsaidthattheywereworkingtorestoreservice.
At9:00AM,TWCreportedthat“services werelargelyrestoredasupdatescontinuetobringallcustomers
back online.” This, of course, was not a complete restoration of services. Finally, at 11:54 AM, TWC
reported that service was restored for all customers. Restoration was confirmed by an end of complaints
onsocialmedia.Theoutagehadleftalmost12million subscribers in29states withoutInternetservice,in

The Cause of the Outage
In describing the cause of the outage, TWC said that “During an overnight network maintenance activity,
in which we were managing IP addresses, an erroneous configuration was propagated throughout our
nationalbackbone,resultinginanetworkoutage.”
TWC’s national backbone provides the paths to which local and regional networks connect in order to
carry Internet messages over long distances. The backbone also provides connectivity with the Internet
services provided by other carriers. Without its backbone, a subscriber could not connect to any web
serviceunlessitwasinhislocalregionandwasservedbyTWC.
It appears clear that the outage was caused by a human error. Internet networks use Border Gateway
Protocol1 (BGP) routers to interconnect their regions and to communicate with other Internet carriers. To
maintain a view of the current Internet topology, BGP routers exchange with their neighbors messages
that advertise new routes and that withdraw unfeasible routes. These changes quickly propagate
throughouttheInternetsothatallroutershaveareasonablycurrentviewoftheInternettopology.
It appears that a routing error may have been introduced into TWC’s network during the maintenance
activity, and this routing error propagated throughout the TWC network. The result was a confused
networkthatcouldnotreliablypassmessagesfromsourcetodestination.
Fined for Lack of Reporting
TWC’s quality control has come under scrutiny. Though Internet carriers are not required to disclose
detailsofunplannedoutages,theymustreportforthcomingplannedoutages.
TWC has been found by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to be in violation of this
requirement. It has fined TWC USD $1.1 million for failing to file a substantial number of planned
downtimenotices.
The Proposed Merger with Comcast
AsthesecondlargestcableproviderintheU.S.,TWCisinthemiddleofanefforttomergewithComcast,
the nation’s largest cable provider. The deal is valued at USD $45.2 billion. The combined company
would be in a position to provide high-capacity Internet services to two-thirds of American households
without any network extensions. 29% of these households have access to only one Internet service
provider. The merged company’s largest competitor would be Verizon, which would overlap just 15% of
thesehouseholds.
Many are opposed to the merger, feeling that it would be a threat to the future of the Internet. With little
competition and no regulation, it is felt that the combined company would be able to freely increase its
fees and restrict the use of its network. This is an especial concern of streaming service companies that
feel that the requirement for Internet neutrality would disappear. The merged companycould give priority
tostreamingservices of its choice, limitingthe bandwidthcapacityof others.Netflix has alreadylaunched
acomplaintrelativetothismatter.
Another concern is that as the networks of the two companies are integrated, an error such as this one
would take down the Internet for almost the entire United States. Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York,
has stated that his state will investigate this outage as part of its ongoing review of the proposed merger.

If approved, the merger is expected to take place in 2015. However, it appears that there are several
roadblocksintheway.
Summary
This outage is consistent with TWC’s reputation among its subscribers, which is dismal at best. The
American Consumer Satisfaction Index shows that TWC has the lowest satisfaction rating of any big
cable provider. Of equal importance is that Comcast has the second lowest rating, just below that of
TWC.This does notbode wellfor acableprovider thatwouldeffectivelycontrolInternetservices formost

Added to this is that the U.S. ranks below other developed nations when it comes to Internet
infrastructure, broadband penetration, and network speeds. In 2013, President Obama announced a plan
