limit,anofflinetransaction-countlimit,andanofflineamountlimit.
Exceptforunusualconditions,atransactioncanbeauthorizedofflineonlyifits amountisbelowthelower
floor limit. For instance, if the lower floor limit is five dollars, only transactions that are at or below five
dollars can be authorized offline. Note that if the lower floor limit is zero, all transactions must be
authorizedonline.
An exception to this rule occurs if the communication between the terminal and the issuer is interrupted.
In such an event, transactions can be authorized offline as long as they are below the upper floor limit.
The upper floor limit allows retailers to continue to service most of their customers if their POS terminals
should go offline. In this case, the merchant is typically responsible for disputed or fraudulent
transactions;butitisariskmostretailersarewillingtotaketomaintaincustomersatisfaction.
The issuer can limit the number or amount of offline transactions that can be authorized before the
terminalmust go online with a transaction. This is accomplished via the offline transaction-count limit and
the offline amount limit. This restriction limits the use of the card to fraudulently make unlimited, small,

A further protection against the offline use of a fraudulent card is that the card randomly forces online

The terminal stores the transaction data. According to rules established by the issuer, the terminal will

Protections
In addition to the SDA/DDA/CDA protections described above for offline transactions, EMV technology
providesseveralotherprotections.
Swiping
The data from the card cannot be read by an attacker because all data transfers between the card and
theterminalareprotectedbythecard’ssecretprivatekeys.
Cloning
Evenif carddatacouldbe compromised,itcannotbe usedtocloneamagnetic-stripecard, which willstill
be in use for some time to come. This is because the cloned card data will not include the CVC1 code
that needs to be written in the magnetic stripe. Without the proper CVC1 code, a magnetic-stripe
transactionwillberejected.
Another protectionagainst cloningisthetransactioncounter.Everytimeacardis insertedintoaterminal,
its transaction counter is incremented. If a cloned card were also being used, the issuer would note that
thetransactioncounterswereoutofsynchronizationandwoulddisablethecardaccountnumber.
Counterfeiting
One concern is that an attacker could obtain a batch of blank EMV cards and a personalization machine
and create what appear to be valid cards for offline transaction purposes. To protect against this, every
batch of blank cards has embedded in the cards a unique symmetric key known only to the issuer.
Therefore,onlytheissuercancreateusableEMVcards.
Card-Not-Present-Fraud
ForInternettransactions,thereisnoterminaltoreadthecardandtoapplytheriskmanagementtests.To
compensate for this, a private handheld reader may be required by some online merchants. The
customer has his own private handheld reader.When he wants to make an Internet purchase, he inserts
hisEMVcardintohisreader.
Thereadergeneratesaone-timeuniquepasscode,whichthecustomerentersintoafieldprovidedonthe
merchant’s checkout page. This passcode verifies to the issuer that the customer is in possession of the
EMVcardbeingused.
UsingSmartCardsatDumbTerminals
Until all POS terminals have become EMV terminals and magnetic stripes have been eliminated from
smart cards, there will always be cases in which smart cards with magnetic stripes are used at “dumb”
POS terminals that read only magnetic stripes. In these cases, all the vulnerabilities of magnetic stripes
that we deal with today still exist. A skimming device or skimming malware can send the card data and
PIN to an attacker, who can clone the card as a magnetic-stripe-only card that can be used at POS
terminals whether they are EMV-capable or not. This is because, for a while to come, all EMV POS
terminalsmuststillbeabletoprocessmagnetic-stripecards.
The EMV Specifications
The first EMV specifications were developed bya consortium comprising Europay, MasterCard, and Visa
– thus the name EMV. The primarymembers of the consortium now include MasterCard (which acquired
Europay), Visa, American Express, Discover, JCB (Japan), and UnionPay (China). Most other payment-

The OmniPayments Financial Transaction Switch
OmniPayments (www.omnipayments.com) from Opsol Inc. (www.opsol.com) is an HP NonStop-based
financial transaction switch that interconnects POS terminals, ATMs, acquiring banks, and issuing banks
via any of the various financial transaction networks. OmniPayments supports all features required to
process EMV smart-card transactions, from support of EMV POS terminals and ATMs to the protocols
required to communicate with the issuing and acquiring banks. OmniPayments is currentlyhandling EMV

systemsasEMVtechnologytakesholdintheUnitedStates.
OmniPayments architecture is based on modern Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). SOA enables new
functionality to be easily added to OmniPayments to meet specific needs of its customers. The core of
OmniPayments is a set of Business Logic Modules, or BLMs. Each BLM is tasked with providing a
specific service for OmniPayments. For instance, OmniATM controls ATMs, OmniPOS controls POS
devices, Transaction Screening offers preauthorization services, and OmniAuth provides stand-in
authorizationservices.
A set of adapters connects the external entities to acquirerterminals issuers

Summary
Magnetic-stripe cards will become a thing of the past as EMV technology is adopted worldwide. This is
almost the case now in countries around the world except for the United States. However, within a few
years,itisexpectedthattheU.S.willcatchup.
Magnetic-stripecardshavebeenprovenoverandoveragainbymajorhackstobeterriblyinsecure.Their
data is easy to skim, the cards are easy to clone, and cloned cards have an active market in the
undergroundInternet.
EMV technology provides strong protection against card-skimming, card-cloning, card-counterfeiting, and
man-in-the-middle attacks. Once EMV technology is universally accepted, our card-payment systems will
become significantly more secure. The OmniPayments financial transaction switch supports EMV POS
terminals and ATMs and the EMV protocols for communication between EMV terminals, acquirers, and
issuers. OmniPayments brings the entire suite of EMV security protection to an organization’s financial
switchingnetwork.
It is said that hackers are smarter than security professionals. Whenever a security vulnerability is
patched, hackers rapidly find a way around it. However, it will take an extremely sophisticated hacker to
breakthroughtheprotectivebarriersofEMV.
