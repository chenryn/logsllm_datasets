Stratus Continues its $50,000 Uptime Guarantee
March2015
In 2010, Stratus Technologies (www.stratus.com) bet $50,000 that its fault-tolerant
ftServer wouldnotgodowninthefirstsixmonthsofoperation.If youboughtasystem by
theendofFebruary,2010,andifitfailedinitsfirstsixmonthsofoperation,Stratuswould
payyou$50,000incash(orinproductcreditifyouwanted).1
How did it do on this wager? It did so well that Stratus announced several extensions
to the guarantee. Five years later, it is sticking to its guarantee. In the five years of the
guarantee, Stratus has not paid out a cent, thus illustrating its claim that ftServers
achieveoverfive9sofavailability.
Stratus’ Expanded Guarantee Now Extends to Virtualization
The ftServer now supports Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2012, as well as Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL), versions 5 through 7. Its support has also been extended to virtualized
environmentswithMicrosoft’sHyper-VandVMware’svSpherehypervisors.
Critical virtualized applications depend upon an extremelyreliable infrastructure on which to run. If a host
server goes down, not just one application is lost. All applications running on that server are down until
they can be failed over to another host server – a process that can take several minutes and even up to
an hour or more for large, complex applications. The impact of a failed server is amplified manyfold in a
virtualizedenvironment.
Stratus ftServers provide fault tolerance for virtualized environments. Stratus has worked closely with
Microsoft and VMware to harden their virtualized environments and to protect systems against both
hardware (Stratus) and software (Windows, Hyper-V, Linux, and vSphere) failures. Stratus feels so
confidentintheresultsthatitcontinuestobet$50,000againstafailure.Butatthistime,itis wageringnot
onlyonitsftServer.Itisbettingthattheentirehardware/softwarevirtualizedenvironmentwillnotfail.
The range of operating systems covered under its guarantee has now been extended from Windows
Server to Linux and to virtualized systems running VMware’s vSphere hypervisor and its guest operating
systems.

The Stratus ftServer
AchievingFive9sAvailability
ftServer uses dual modular redundancy to provide plug-and-play fault
tolerance to Windows, Linux, and virtualized applications. To measure the
availability of its servers in the field, Stratus monitors its service incident
reports and updates an Uptime Meter daily, which it displays on its ftServer StratusftServerUptimeMeter
web site.2 The Uptime Meter covers all hardware, operating system, and asofFebruary20,2015
hypervisor failure incidents and consistently shows an availability of five 9s or better (an average of five
minutesofdowntimeperyearorless).
ftServerArchitecture
The high availability of the Stratus ftServer product line is achieved by running all applications on dual
processors that are lockstepped at the memory-access level. Should
there be a disagreement between the processors, one of the
processors has suffered a fault. If the faulty processor has detected its
own fault, that processor is taken out of service. Otherwise, each
processor enters a self-test mode; and the processor in error is taken
outofservice.
Each processor contains its own I/O subsystem. In normal operation,
peripheral devices are driven by both I/O subsystems via a multipath connection. However, if an I/O
subsystemdetectsamalfunction,itwillremoveitselffromservice.

Each logical processor is connected to each of the I/O subsystems. In this way, any combination of one

The ftServers use industry-standard multi-core Intel Xeon processor chips. Depending upon the model of

microprocessor cores, memory, and I/O subsystem but also integrated disks, a portion of which can be
solid state drives (SSDs). The internal storage is mirrored between the slices, providing fault-tolerant
storagewithintheftServeritself.

Virtualization
Virtualization technology allows many virtual machines to run on a single server. Virtualization is an
importanttechniqueforgettingfullutilizationoutoflargeserverfarms.
A problem faced with virtualization technology is that availability becomes far more important. One
particular application may not have a high value and can suffer some downtime without serious
consequence. However, run many of these as virtual machines on a single server, and a server failure
becomesmuchmorecostly.
Stratus has integrated the ftServer with Microsoft’s Hyper-V and VMware’s vSphere hypervisors to allow
an ftServer to host multiple virtual Windows and Linux machines in any combination. The hypervisor sits
on top of the ftServer hardware and supports multiple instances of different guest operating systems
runningasiftheywereintheirownphysicalservers.
As a result, it is very simple to add a fault-tolerant pool of servers to a virtualized server farm. It is this
integrationofftServerwithVMware’svSpherethatStratusiswageringwillnotfail.
HardenedCommodityOperatingSystems
TheWindowsandRedHatLinuxoperatingsystemsthatStratussupportsarethosethatarecommercially
available to anyone. The same is true of the Hyper-V and vSphere hypervisors. Therefore, the ftServers
are application binary interface (ABI) compatible with Windows and Linux applications. Any application
that can run under Windows or Red Hat Linux on an industry-standard server can run on an ftServer
without modification, either directlyor as aWindows or Linux virtual machinerunning on topof one of the
supported hypervisors. The installation and administration procedures are identical. The user should see
nodifferenceexceptfordowntime–andthatisthebigdifference.Thereisnodowntime.
When a new operating system version is about to be released, Stratus engineers do everything that they
can to break it. Stratus engineers claim that they have not yet found a device driver that they could not
break. Faults that involve the operating system are reported back to Microsoft and Red Hat, who make
corrections to eliminate the sources of those failures. Everyone benefits from this effort because it is the
hardenedversionthatis releasedfor public use.TheWindows andRedHatLinux operatingsystems that

The Three-Legged Stool
Dual modular redundancy is only one leg of the
fault-tolerant capability of the ftServers. The other
legs are the Automated Uptime Layer and
ProactiveAvailabilityManagement.
AutomatedUptimeLayer
Stratus ftServers use pairs of hardware
componentstoeliminateanysinglepointoffailure.
The Automated Uptime Layer provides a single-
system view that keeps these redundant
components running in perfect lockstep. The user
also sees a single-system image. Unlike clusters, management of the system is the same as if the
applications were running ona single standard commodityserver. Also,multiple licenses for software are
notnecessary.
A primary function of the Automated Uptime Layer is to detect potential faults before they cause an
outage. More than 500 conditions in the ftServer hardware and software are monitored. This includes

indicators of resource exhaustion and poor performance. The Automated Uptime Layer can decide to
alarm the Stratus Customer Assistance Center, and action is immediatelytaken by Stratus technicians to
diagnosetheproblem.Thiscapabilityisdubbed“StratusCallHome.”
If acomponent needs to be replaced, Stratus willsend the component to the customer’s sitevia next day
delivery.Therearemanycasesinwhichthefirstsignofaproblem tothecustomeriswhenitreceivesthe
replacement part in the mail. A failed processor is easily replaced by an untrained customer. No special
tools or operational procedures are required. Simply remove the failed processor and slip the new
processor into the ftServer chassis. The new processor will automatically synchronize itself and begin its
lockstepprocessing.
ProactiveAvailabilityManagement
If the user chooses to use Stratus’s proactive availability management services, Stratus support
technicians monitor the system over its secure ActiveService Network (ASN). Using information provided
by the Automated Uptime Layer, these experts are ready 24/7 to remotely diagnose and remediate more
complex issues than those thatcanbeautomaticallyresolved bythe Automated UptimeLayer.There are

Summary
Stratus’ fault-tolerant systems change the focus of availability from hardware failures and operating-
system faults to other factors. Application bugs, operator errors, and environmental faults such as power,
cooling,anddata-centerdestructionnowbecomethethingsaboutwhichtomostworry.
Continuous availability is no longer a technological problem. It is an exercise in balancing system cost
with downtime cost. Stratus’ ftServer is an affordable starting point to achieve extreme availabilities.
