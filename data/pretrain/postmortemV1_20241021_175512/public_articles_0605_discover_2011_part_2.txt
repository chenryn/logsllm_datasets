3907 - Achieving better availability and disaster tolerance with HP Serviceguard Solutions
andOracleonHP-UX11i
JonathanPatrizioandGuhendranDevendran,HP
Oracle applications and databases are crucial to the smooth operation of many enterprises that
provide 24x7 services to customers. Achieving these service level objectives while taking a
standard approach to deploying and supporting a complex variety of applications can be
challenging. HP Serviceguard extensions and toolkits integrate Oracle software on HP-UX,
allowing the whole stack to be deployed in a highly-available and disaster-tolerant environment
possible. This session will explain how architects can deploy Oracle RAC with Serviceguard
Extension for RAC (SGeRAC), Serviceguard Extension for Oracle E-Business Suite and the
Serviceguard Toolkit for Oracle Data Guard. Attendees will learn how to choose an architecture
thatmatchesanapplication'scriticalitywiththeappropriatelevelofdisasterrecovery.Toillustrate

4666 - Protecting the security and availability of next-generation telecommunication
services
AnshPatnaik,HP
Six key trends in telecommunications are driving a major transformation of the industry. These
trends (migration to IP-based networks, SmartPhone adoption, industry consolidation, regulatory
oversight, BPO, and managed services) enable new revenue sources but also introduce
significant cybersecurity risk. Telecoms that can satisfy the demand for new consumer and
business services while mitigating the associated risks stand to build a stronger brand and a
bigger competitive advantage. However, effectively addressing the risks that accompany the
trends and opportunities requires visibility into all network and business activity-which telecoms
lack today. This session will review the trends, opportunities, and associated risks facing
telecommunications firms and will highlight a comprehensive approach to delivering next-
generation services through continuous and automated monitoring using the HP security product
portfolio.

faulttolerance
BradKatzandJoshuaPowell,HP
Hands-OnLab
Learn to set up and configure a multi-site P4000 cluster, and demonstrate a site failure using

configuration using P4000 storage. They will then demonstrate the ability of the P4000 Multi-Site
cluster to survive a site failure by taking down half the P4000 nodes and using VMware High
AvailabilityandFault Toleranceto keepvirtualmachines and applications on line duringafailure.
This hands-on lab provides an excellent opportunity to learn key concepts around P4000 multi-
site clustering, including Network RAID, network configuration and failover managers. A focus on
VMwareFTprovidesfurtherhands-onopportunities.
