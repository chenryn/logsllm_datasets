Improving Power Availabilitywith Microgrids
November2016
Portions of the electrical power grid in the United States often fail, leaving millions of
people without power, sometimes for weeks. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy, the second
most costly hurricane in U.S. history, caused six million people to be without power in
several states along the Eastern Seaboard. Hurricane Matthew took down power for three million people
in the U.S. Southeast. These storms also disrupted diesel fuel supply, hindering attempts to keep
emergencypower-generationstationsoperating.
Now more and more, communities are looking into the feasibility of deploying microgrids to ensure the
continuation of power should the major power grid go down. Let us look at what microgrids are, how they
work,andsomeexamplesoftheirplanneddeployment.
What is a Microgrid?
Microgrids are local energy networks that are able to separate from the larger electrical grid during
extreme weather events or emergencies, providing power to individual customers and crucial public
services such as hospitals, first responders, and water treatment facilities. Microgrids offer refuge from
power outage disasters. By automatically disconnecting from cascading destruction, they protect their
customers from power outages in the larger grid. They then activate their own distributed generators to
continuetosupplyelectricalpower.
A microgrid usually comprises distributed energy resources with clearly defined electrical boundaries. It
acts as a single, controllable entity with respect to the grid and can connect and disconnect from the grid

A microgrid can power a single facility, or it may power part of a town. The microgrid itself may be
powered via several means, including distributed diesel generators, batteries, and renewable energy
sources such as solar panels or wind power. Multiple power sources maybe involved in supplying power

A microgrid not onlyprovides backup for the grid in case of emergencies, but it can allow communities to

The New York Prize
The U.S. Northeast has embarked on a campaign to build microgrids to serve shelters, hospitals, police,
firestations,watertreatmentplants,grocerystores,andgasstations.
New York State in the United States is actively encouraging microgrids. The USD $40 million New York
Prize is a state program that is aimed at helping communities create microgrids. Through this program,
the state has funded 83 projects throughout New York State to evaluate the feasibility of installing and
operatingacommunitymicrogrid.
The NY Prize helps communities reduce costs, promote clean energy, and build reliability and resiliency
into the electric grid via microgrids. The NY Prize is part of a statewide endeavor to modernize New York
State’s electric grid,spurringinnovationandcommunitypartnerships withutilities,localgovernments,and
the private sector. Its mission is to enable the technological, operational, and business models that will
helpcommunitiesreducecosts,promotecleanenergy,andbuildreliabilityandresiliencyintothegrid.
NY Prize is designed to support new local energy microgrids that will provide power to multiple
customers, including residential and commercial customers as well as crucial public services such as
hospitals,firstresponders,andwatertreatmentfacilities.
Communitymicrogrids will often build on existing infrastructure and equipment, connecting multiple users
in a neighborhood in the event of a power outage, offering energy independence as well as local power
generationanddistribution.
The microgrids will allow the use of clean, efficient distributed energy resources such as wind, solar,
combinedheatandpower, andenergystorage,thus improvingtheenvironmentalandeconomichealthof
thecommunity.
The NY Prize aims to broaden the scope of microgrids, which today serve only a single user such as a
university or a hospital. New microgrids will connect multiple users through a network relying on clean,
reliable,andaffordableenergysources.
New York’s Lower East Side
New York City’s Lower East Side won $100,000 in the first round of funding in the New York Prize
competitiontoevaluate its proposalfor amicrogrid.NamedtheTwo Bridges/BeyondtheGridCommunity
Microgrid, the microgrid will serve a mix of public and private residential, institutional, and commercial
sites on Avenue C between East 10th Street and East 14th Street in the East Village. This area was
severelyimpactedbyfloodingandpoweroutagesduringSuperstormSandy.
The team is proposing a USD $15.4 million community microgrid project that will provide 100% of the
power requirements for about 4,000 residents in eleven buildings, including four schools, a community
center,apharmacy,asupermarket,andavarietyofapartmentbuildings.
The microgrid will include a mix of natural gas and renewable energy generation sources. It will provide
two megawatts of power and will contain eight megawatt-hours of storage capacity. The microgrid will

Alaska’s Microgrids
41%ofAlaskanresidentsresideinAnchorage.Therestliveinsmallruralcommunitiesspreadthroughout
the state. 90% of these communities generate their electricity via diesel-generated power. However, due
to transportation costs and other logistical challenges, rural communities pay up to four times more for
dieselfuelthatthoseelsewhereinthestate.
Nevertheless,Alaska’senergysector hasexcelledinonearea–themicrogridsthatarelocatedinremote
communities. Alaska operates 12% of the world’s microgrids. Almost 250 microgrids generate power
rangingfrom30kilowattsto100megawatts.
Most of these microgrids run on diesel power. However, over 70 of these microgrids integrate some sort
ofrenewableenergysuchashydroprojects,wind,solar,andbiomass.
Energy Storage
Energy storage within a microgrid can play a major role in facilitating the use of renewable energy
sources by protecting the power stability and reliability of the microgrid. A microgrid’s reliability is
predicatedonitsabilitytoofferaseamlesssupplyoflocalelectricity.However,renewableenergysources
such as wind and solar are intermittent. On a windless day, there will be no wind power. Nor is there any
solarpoweratnight.
There must be a balance between load demand and generator output. In a centralized grid, fossil-fueled
generatorswillrampupanddowntoensuretheiroutputiskeptinbalancewithdemand.
The same kind of capability is needed in a microgrid. Energy storage devices can act as a buffer, either

Energy storage can also provide a source of power during outages that last for an extended period of
time. In addition, the availability of energy storage solves the problem of providing power during the
several seconds that it takes for a microgrid diesel generator to spin up when the microgrid is
disconnectedfromthegrid.
Summary
Microgrids are a fairly new technology. They are just now being planned in many communities, though
they have been in service is such areas as Alaska for a while. As microgrids become more widespread,
the power outages we experience due to major storms and other causes should become less and less
frequent.
