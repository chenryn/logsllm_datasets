If related transactions can flow over multiple threads, one must be careful to apply the
transactions to the target database in the same order that they were applied to the source
database in order to ensure the referential integrity of the target database. Shadowbase ensures

DataTransformation
In heterogeneous environments, the database structures of the source and target systems are
almost certain to be different. Even in homogeneous environments, data structures and field
definitions may be different. An extreme case is replication between a relational database and a
filesystem.
Therefore, it is important that the data replication engine be able to reformat changes as they
move from the source system to the target system. Shadowbase provides two facilities for doing
this:
 Data format changes can be specified via Shadowbase’s Transformation and Mapping
Facility,whichprovidesascriptinglanguageforspecifyingdatatransformations.
 Mostof the Shadowbasecomponents support embeddinguser exits, which arecustomer
written transformation algorithms for specifying to Shadowbase how the data is to be
filtered, cleansed, or transformed. These components include the Consumer, the Open
Server,theDOCreader,andtheTFSandTRSprocesses.

 AUDMON monitors the Shadowbase components in a node and will automaticallyrestart
a critical process that has failed. In NonStop servers, AUDMON is implemented as a
fault-tolerantprocesspair.
 AUDCOM provides a command interface so that users can configure and control
Shadowbase and monitor its status. AUDCOM may run on either the source system or
thetargetsystem.
 The Shadowbase Enterprise Manager (SEM) is a Windows GUI that provides integrated
command and monitoring support for the Shadowbase components running on the
variousplatforms.
SOLV
The Shadowbase Online Copy, Verification and Validation utility (SOLV)2 provides the facility for
the online copying of databases, for verifying that two databases match, and for correcting a
databasethatisoutofsynchronism.
OnlineCopying
In active/active systems, it is imperative to be able to create a copy of an active database for a
node that is to be brought into service, whether it is being repaired or it is a new system node
beingintroducedintothenetwork.Thesourcenodecannotbetakendownwhilethecopyisbeing

Acommonwaytodothis is totakeasnapshotof thedatabaseatagivenpointin time.However,
thesnapshotmaytakeseveralhourstotransferandloadintothetargetdatabase; anditisthena
copy of the database that is several hours stale. To bring it up to date, the changes that have
queued during the snapshot interval must be replayed, a process that itself can take several
hours–perhapslongerthanthesnapshottook.
SOLV makes a copy of an active database that it keeps up-to-date as the copy proceeds. Thus,
whenthecopyis complete, thetargetdatabaseis immediatelyreadytouse. SOLVaccomplishes
thisbyintegratingcloselywiththeShadowbasedatareplicationengine.

SOLV is the copyprocess. It will lock and read a block of data from the source database and will
send it to the Consumer, which will write it to the target database. To keep the target database
up-to-date, changes to the source database are also replicated by Shadowbase to the target
database,asdescribedpreviously.
However, the flow of data blocks and the flow of changes must be synchronized to ensure that
the data block has been written to the target database before subsequent changes to that data
block areapplied.Toaccomplishthis,SOLVwritesintothedatastream amarkerindicatingthata
specified block has just been transferred. When the Consumer receives the marker, it will insert
the referenced data block into the replication stream at the place of the marker. Thus, any data
block changes that were received after the data block was read from the source system are
guaranteedtoarriveonlyafterthedatablockhasbeenwrittentothetargetsystem.

VerificationandValidation
A target database can be verified by a simple extension to SOLV. Rather than writing a data
block tothetargetdatabase,thatblock is insteadread from thetargetdatabaseandcomparedto
theblock receivedfrom thesourcesystem.Comparisoncanbebasedoncomparingthecontents
ofthesourceandtargetrowsorbysimplycomparingchecksumsorrow-versionindicators.
This procedure protects against row differences due to replication latency (i.e., inflight changes
thathavenot yetreachedthetargetdatabase).Therows areguaranteedtobeidenticalsincethe
source rows were locked up to the point of the marker. If there is a difference in the rows, the
errorisreported.
DatabaseResynchronization
Verification and validation can be extended to resynchronize the databases if there is a
comparisonerror.Thisisdonebyusingthesource-rowcontentstorepairthetargetrow.
If the rows mismatch, the target row is replaced with the source row. If the source row exists but
the target row does not, the source row is inserted. If the target row exists but the source row
doesnot,thetargetrowisdeleted.
Zero Downtime Migration with Shadowbase and SOLV
Shadowbase, in conjunction with SOLV, can be used to eliminate planned downtime due to
upgradesormigrations.Usinganactive/activesystemasanexample,thenodetobeupgradedis
taken out of the application network. During this time, the remaining nodes in the application
network handletheentiretransactionload.Inthefollowingfigure,thegreendatabasesareactive,
thereddatabaseisoffline,andtheyellowdatabaseisbeingloaded.
The decommissioned node is upgraded and tested. When it is ready to be returned to service,
SOLV is used to recreate its application database. Shadowbase replication then keeps that
databasecurrentwhilethenodeisreturnedtoservice.
Bidirectional replication is turned on at the upgraded node, and transaction flow is restored to it.
Normal operation has now been restored. However, should the upgraded node exhibit problems,
it is straightforward to take it once again out of service, correct the problem, and return it to
servicewithnodisruptiontotheservicesbeingprovidedtotheusers.

If other nodes are to be upgraded, the upgrade process can be rolled through the application
networkonenodeatatime.
This same process can be used to add new nodes to an application network. It can also be used
to upgrade a single system if another system is available on loan or if the system can be
partitionedtosupporttwoinstancesoftheapplication.

The Future
One serious need which is not yet available for active/active systems is efficient synchronous
replication. With synchronous replication, there are no data collisions; nor is there any data loss
following a node failure. However, current methods for synchronously replicating data impose a
seriouspenaltyontheperformanceoftheirsupportedapplications.
Gravic plans to introduce an efficient synchronous replication product based on their patented
coordinated commit method. The coordinated commit method uses asynchronous replication to
propagate changes to the target system but coordinates the commits of transactions among the
variousnodesintheapplicationnetworkafterallchangeshavebeenreplicated.3
