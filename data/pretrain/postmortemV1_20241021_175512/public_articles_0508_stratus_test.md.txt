Stratus’ ftServer Flexes Its Recovery Muscle
August2010
The ftServer from Stratus Technologies is a hardware-based, fault-tolerant
server for running Windows and Linux applications. Its scalability and
recoverability were recently measured in June, 2010, by Principled
Technologies,Inc.
Under atestcommissioned byStratus andNEC1toassess ftServer’s scalabilityandits resilience
to catastrophic events, Principled Technologies stressed the ftServer incrementally by adding
virtual CPUs (vCPUs) to a single VMware virtual machine (VM). At peak load, one of the two
redundant servers - memory, processor, I/O subsystem, disks, and all – was pulled from the
chassistomeasuretheftServer’srecoverytimefromsuchacatastrophicfailure.
The results showed performancemeasured in tens of thousands of orders per minute. Scalability
was reasonably linear up to four vCPUs. With eight vCPUs running, the induced massive fault
caused by removing one of the redundant processors resulted in virtually no performance
degradationandnooflossofapplicationdataoritsintegrity.

TheftServer architectureis described insomedetailin our earlier article,FaultTolerantWindows
and Linux from Stratus, which was published in the September 2007 issue of the Availability
Digest ( http://www.availabilitydigest.com/public_articles/0209/stratus.pdf). ftServers from Stratus
Technologies (www.stratus.com) provide plug-and-play fault tolerance for Windows and Red Hat
Linux applications. Using Intel Xeon chips in a dual modular redundancy architecture, ftServers
bring extremely high availability – five 9s and beyond – to the industry standard marketplace at
affordableprices.
DualProcessors
The high availability obtained by the Stratus ftServer product
line is achieved by running all applications on dual processors
that are lockstepped at the memory-access level. The dual
physical processors appear to the outside world as a single
logicalprocessor.
Should there be a disagreement between the processors, one
of the processors has suffered a fault and is taken out of service. The faulty processor can be

Each processor is packaged as a 2U module. The processors are interconnected via a small,
passivebackplane.AcompletestandaloneftServer,therefore,hasa4Uformfactor.
I/OSubsystem
Each 2U module contains its own I/O subsystem. Both I/O subsystems also have their own fault
detection and isolation logic. In normal operation, peripheral devices are driven by both I/O
subsystemsviaamultipathconnection.However,ifanI/Osubsystemdetectsamalfunction,itwill

Each logical processor is connected to both I/O subsystems. In this way, anycombination of one
logicalprocessorfailureandoneI/Osubsystemfailurewillnotrenderthesysteminoperable.
IntegratedDisks
Each processor contains not only its microprocessor cores, memory, and I/O subsystem but also
three 500 gigabyte integrated disks. Thus, both logical processors have direct access to 1.5
terabytes of local storage. This storage is mirrored between the processors, providing 1.5
terabytesoffault-tolerantstoragewithintheftServeritself.
OperatingSystems
The Windows and Red Hat Linux operating systems that Stratus supports are those that are
commercially available to anyone. Therefore, the ftServers are application binary interface (ABI)
compatible withWindows and Linux applications. Any application that can run under Windows or
Red Hat Linux on an industry-standard server can run without modification on an ftServer. The
installationandadministrationprocedures areidentical.Theusershouldseenodifferenceexcept

The Test Configuration
SystemConfiguration
The Principled Technologies’ test was run on a Stratus ftServer 6300. Each of the redundant
processors provided dual sockets for quad-core microprocessor chips. Therefore, the logical
ftServerhadaccesstoeightcores.
Both physical processors were configured with 48 GB of memory, giving the logical processor 48
GBofmemory.
The ftServer was connected via fibre channel to a NEC D3-10 SAN that contained the virtual
machine.
VMware ESX 4.0 was configured to be the hypervisor for the test. The test did not use the
VMware Fault Tolerance or the VMware High Availability products to provide availability. The
availabilitycharacteristicstestedwerestrictlythosethatwerenativetotheftServer.
A single VM running Microsoft Server 2008 R2 as its guest operating system was configured for
the application. The number of virtual CPUs running in that VM was varied from one to eight, the
maximumnumberofcoresavailable.
The benchmark test was database-intensive. Microsoft SQL Server was used as the database
manager for the application. Three virtual disks were configured – one for the operating system,

TheTestDriver
The open-source “DVD Store Version 2” (DS2) benchmark2 was used to exercise the system.
DS2 simulates an online ecommerce DVD store. Simulated customers log in, browse movies by
actor, title, and category, and purchase movies. The title and actor searches use full-text search.
DS2 provides other administrative functions, such as adding new customers. Each simulated

A single instance of DS2 was configured with 32 threads to run on a control server. DS2 is
structured to use a web interface to submit requests to a database server. However, in this test,

Test Results
Scalability
The scalability test measured scaling in a single VM as vCPUs were added. This test is
particularly important for database applications that must scale beyond one vCPU. Note that the
test system used a 5 GB database in a processor with 48 GB of memory. Therefore, the
database was likely to be cached in memory; and the test measured raw processor power. Test

The ftServer scaled fairly linearly up to four vCPUs, as shown in Table 1 and in Figure 1.
Doubling the number of vCPUs from one to two resulted in more than twice the capacity. This
was perhaps due to SQL Server optimization for multiple CPUs. Moving to 8 vCPUs showed
saturationofthesystemandwasusedtotestrecoverability.
Recoverability
The recoverability test measured the ability of the ftServer to recover from a catastrophic failure.
Running at maximum capacity with eight vCPUs, one of the redundant lockstepped servers was
pulled from the chassis - processor, memory, I/O channels, disks, and all. The processing
