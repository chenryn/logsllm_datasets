BloggingSitePutOutofBusinessbyDisgruntledEmployee
Started in 2003, JournalSpace was a popular and growing blog-hosting service. It was primarily a free
service supported by advertising. Unfortunately, in December, 2008, thousands of blogs were wiped out
whenJournalSpacelostitsentiredatabaseandwasunabletorecover.
Apparently, the database’s demise was the malicious act of a disgruntled employee – even worse, the IT
manager. JournalSpace claims that it had caught the IT manager stealing from the company. They
summarily fired him; but he did a slash-and-burn on his way out, overwriting the entire database with
garbage.
This should have been only a minor irritant because all that was needed to cure the problem was to
restore the database from the backup copy. The problem? No backup copy! It was, of course, the IT
manager’s responsibility to ensure that a backup copy was periodically taken and preserved. However,
though he dutifully backed up the HTML code for the site on a remote server, his backup strategy for the
blog database was to use a RAID 2 mirrored disk. If one disk failed, the database was still available on
themirror.
In a panic, JournalSpace management sent the hard disks to a service known for recovering data from
burnt, drowned, and crushed hard drives. Unfortunately, the answer was ultimately “no.” The disks were
unrecoverable.Theyhadbeenoverwrittenwithrandomdata,obliteratingtheoriginaldata.

SonyPlayStationTakenDownforWeeksbyHackers
This may be the biggest hacking story in history. From April 16th to April 18th, 2011, hackers gained
access to Sony’s online gaming servers and stole sensitive personal information for over 100 million
accounts. Sony did not discover the breach until April 19th. It promptly closed down its online gaming
servicesuntilitcouldrestructureitssecuritydefenses.
Over 77 million PlayStation accounts were compromised. Sony announced that the enhancements it
needed to beef up its security protection services would be time-consuming. It predicted that some
serviceswouldbebackonlineduringthefirstweekinMay.
Then on May 1st, the magnitude of the disaster was discovered to be worse than originally thought. The
investigating team found that the mid-April attacks had also similarly compromised the 25 million
subscriber accounts for Sony Online Entertainment. The company shut down the SOE services the next
day and ceased making predictions as to when services would be restored. Services were gradually
restoredthroughmid-May.Sony’sgamingserviceshadbeendownforseveralweeks!
ThoughSonyis teamingwiththeFBI(theU.S.FederalBureau of Investigation) andprivateinvestigators,
the perpetrators have yet to be identified. However, there is evidence that points to a hacking group
named “Anonymous” that wanted to get revenge for Sony’s “unfair legal actions” against a well-known
hackerwhohadmanagedtofindandpublishthesecretkeystoSony’sonlinegames.
TwitterTakenDownbyDDoSAttack
On Thursday, August 6, 2009, Twitter suddenly became unavailable to those trying to use it. During that
day and much of the next, Twitter was down for a few hours, would seem to recover but would be

sluggish or subject to timeouts, and then would go down again. Continuous periods of outages and
timeoutscontinuedwellintothenextday.
It didn’t take long for Twitter to conclude that it seemed to be a target of a distributed denial of service
attack (DDoS), in which its servers were being swamped by spam messages. The spam messages were
all queries against the blog of a single user who went by the user name Cyxymu. Clearly, someone was
outtosilenceCyxymu.Butwhy?
It turned out that Cyxymu was a pro-Georgian blogger, a 34-year old economics lecturer from Tbilisi,
Georgia, who had been criticizing Russia’s conduct in its war the previous year over the disputed South
Ossetiaregion.CyxymuisthenameofatownintheformerSovietUnion.
In later posts, Cyxymu blamed Russia for the attack. He suggested that the timing of the attack was
