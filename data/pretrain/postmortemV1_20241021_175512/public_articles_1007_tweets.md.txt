– Our July Twitter Feed of Outages
July2015
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass.With our new Twitter presence, we don’t
have to feel guilty. This article highlights some of the tweets that made headlines in
recentdays.
TheMakingofUnited'sSummerFrom AirlineHell
United and Continentalclosed their merger in 2010andcreated what was then the world’s largest
airline. Fifty-seven months later, executives are still working to integrate United Continental Holdings
into a single company — and struggling with some high-profile operational and customer service
problems.

A Digest Oldie but Goodiefrom TheGeek Corner: 'TheCost of RPO and RTO'
The purpose of availability analysis is to determine how to limit downtime and data loss. Both cost a
corporation money and reputation. But improving them also costs money. Improvement generally
means adding redundancy to the corporate systems. How does one balance the cost of availability
improvement against the savings of reduced downtime and lost data? For every application, the
company should set certain objectives for lost downtime and lost data. The objective for lost
downtime is called the Recovery Time Objective, or RTO. The objective for lost data is called the
RecoveryPointObjective,orRPO.

TheReallyBigOne
Most people in the U.S. know just one fault line by name: the San Andreas, which runs nearly the
length of California and is perpetually rumored to be on the verge of unleashing “the big one.”That
rumor is misleading. The Cascadia subduction zone, discovered only 45 years ago, runs for seven
hundred miles off the coast of the U.S. Pacific Northwest. If the entire zone gives way at once, an
event that seismologists call a full-margin rupture, the magnitude will be somewhere between 8.7
and9.2.That’stheverybigone.Oddsofithappeninginthenext50yearsareincreasing.

WhyTimeWill Stop For aLeap Second
Justas leap yearskeep ourcalendarslined up with Earth'srevolution around the sun,leap seconds
adjust for Earth's rotation. This kind of fine-tuning wasn't much of an issue before the invention of
atomic clocks, whose ticks are defined by the cycling of atoms.Cesium-based clocks, one kind of
atomic clock, measure the passage of time much more precisely than those based on the rotation
ofourplanet,soaddinga leapsecondallowsastronomicaltime to catchup to atomictime.
