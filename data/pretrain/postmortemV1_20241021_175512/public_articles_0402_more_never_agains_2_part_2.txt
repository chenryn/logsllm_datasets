Brisbane Times, Thursday, December 4, 2008 – For the umpteenth time over the last half year,
the Commonwealth Bank of Brisbane, Australia, had to field irate customer calls. The latest
incident was due to a technical glitch that crippled its online banking system, Netbank, for the
second time in two weeks. In late November, thousands of dollars disappeared from 200,000
accounts after transfers were duplicated due to batching errors. In October, Centrelink payments
were delayed to thousands of customers due to another computer glitch. Despite continuing

Las Vegas Review Journal, December 11, 2008 – All of Southeastern Nevada lost Embarq
services and some Verizon services on the morning of December 10th. A construction crew

several copper and fiber cables used by Embarq. It took two days to restore service. Verizon

African News, Tuesday, December 23, 2008 – Located in Southeast Africa, Malawi is among the
world's leastdevelopedandmostdenselypopulatedcountries.5OnDecember,2008,thecountry
was isolated by a massive communications fault. During an upgrade of an auxiliary switch in the
capital city of Lilongwe by the nation’s largest mobile carrier, Zain, a technical glitch took down
the country’s entire mobile network for over four days. The problem was compounded by Zain’s
initiative to provide cheap, subsidized phones to the Malawian population. This led to a mass of
repeated dial-in attempts, further overloading the operating remnants of the system. In this case,

Microsoft’sZuneMP3PlayerDoesn’tSurvivetheNewYear’sCelebration
Cnet News, January 1, 2009 – Microsoft’s 30-GB Zune MP3 players stopped playing on New
Year’s Day, 2009. It turned out that the Zune’s clock software crashed when rolling over the last
day of a leap year and totally locked up the device. It could not even be turned off since the
software was looping in the date routine. Microsoft said that the only correction was to let the
battery drain and then to bring it back to life after noontime GMT on January 1st. After the efforts
to avoid Y2K problems, one would like to think that Microsoft would have been sensitive to the
leap-yearproblem.

The China Post, Wednesday, January 7, 2009 – The immigration computers used by Taiwan’s
National Immigration Agency crashed early in the morning of Tuesday, January 6th. Service was
not restored until late the next afternoon. In the meantime, thousands of passengers waiting for
clearance to leave Taiwan queued up at airports and cruise ports around the country. It was
reported that two backup systems had failed, one after the other, as a result of damage to their
hard drives. There was a suspicion the failures may have been caused by a disgruntled
employee.
AvalancheHitsJuneau–Again
Juneau Empire, Wednesday, January 14, 2009 – Last April, a mile-and-a-half-wide avalanche
wiped out power transmission lines and three towers delivering power from the Snettisham
hydroelectric dam to Juneau, Alaska’s capital.8 Power was lost for a month-and-a-half as the city
converted to diesel generators, raising electricity rates by 400%. Lightning never strikes twice,
right? Wrong. Just nine months later, another avalanche recently took down one of the three
towers that had been replaced, throwing Juneau once again into the dark. The good news? Oil

Not good! Perhaps its Web site was a victim also. GoDaddy suffered a similar attack in
November, 2005, when 600,000 customers were affected. With GoDaddy’s plethora of servers,
these had to be massive attacks.We wish GoDaddy well in protecting itself from such attacks in
