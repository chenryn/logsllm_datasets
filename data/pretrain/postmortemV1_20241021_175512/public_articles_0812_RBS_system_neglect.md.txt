The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS)
Together with its subsidiary banks, NatWest and Ulster Bank, RBS provides banking facilities throughout
the U.K. and Ireland. RBS has about 700 branches, mainly in Scotland. RBS’ roots date well back into
history – it was founded in 1727. It currently employs over 140,000 people. It has about 24 million
customersintheU.K.
NatWest (the National Westminster Bank) was acquired by RBS in 2000. NatWest, with 1,600 branches,

During the 2008 housing crash, RBS was bailed out by U.K. taxpayers. RBS is now 82% owned by the
British government. It is undergoing a continuing investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority

What Was the Cause of This Outage?
RBS was quick to state that their systems did not go down because of Cyber Monday volume, nor had
theybeenattackedbyhackers.Nospecificproblemwascommunicatedtothepublic.
However, Ross McEwan, the new CEO of RBS (for just a month at the time), blamed the outage on his
predecessors.As aresultofmergers andacquisitions,theRBSIT environmenthadbecomeapatchwork
of systems that was becoming more and more difficult to maintain. For years, RBS had made little

In an effort to help customers during the outage, the bank tweeted a redirect link that customers could
use to get service. However, this proved to be a boon for hackers, who used the opportunity to send out

phishing emails passing unsuspecting users to bogus web sites. These sites appeared to be real but
were really designed to capture a customer’s banking credentials. There were reports of monies that had
been stolen from accounts. RBS urged customers not to click on links or open attachments in suspicious
emails.
McEwan’s goal now is to build IT systems that customers can rely upon. He has pledged to spend £700
millioninthenextthreeyearstoimprovethebank’ssystems.
A History of RBS Outages
RBS has been plagued with a history of IT outages. In March of 2013, RBS, NatWest, and Ulster Bank
mobile applications went down for six hours. Customers could not access their accounts via their mobile
phoneapps.Earlierintheyear,ATMsandallonlineaccessweredown.
The granddaddy of all outages hit RBS in June of 2012. It caused weeks of havoc. The outage was
causedbyanupgradegonemassivelywrong.1OvertheweekendofJune16thand17th,thebank decided
to upgrade its CA 7 batch facility to a new version. It found a problem with the new version and backed it

of CA Technologies, it took until June 22nd to pinpoint the cause of failure and to resume the batch run.
However, during this time, scheduled bills could not be paid, employers could not pay their employees,
and pensioners could not get their pension payments. Interbank transfers could not be made, which

operations.
The outage cost the bank £175 million. This included compensation to customers for money lost and the
costof extended branch bankinghours,expandedcall centers,and working withcredit-rating agencies to

Following in the Steps of the Australian Banks
The RBS series of failures due to an aging IT infrastructure mirrors what is going on in Australia.2 The
National Australian Bank, Westpac, the Commonwealth Bank, and the Australia and New Zealand Bank
(ANZ)haveallsufferedmultiplemajoroutagesoverthepastthreeyears.
As with RBS, these outages have occurred because of outdated IT environments. The Australian banks
are undergoing a massive upgrade of their systems. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has
said that it will not accept outages due to institutions running outdated, unsupported operating systems,
hardware, or applications. Nor will it stand for outages caused by running critical systems with single
pointsoffailureorbylosingcriticalskills.IthaswarnedaboutcuttingITbudgets.

Summary
RBS’ chief executive, Ross McEwan, has said that British banking technology lags behind Australia. We
wonderwhatotherbankingsectorsmaybefacingthisverysameproblem.
Within the RBS infrastructure, McEwan has committed to spend £700 million over the next three years to
bring his systems up to date. However, it is reported that executive bonuses for this year will total about
£500million.ThatwouldbewelcomemoneytosolveRBS’availabilityproblems.
