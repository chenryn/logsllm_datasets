Malicious Apple Chargers
August2013
Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have discovered an unlikely back door
intoAppledevices.BillyLau,YeongjinJang,andChengyu Songhavedemonstratedthatthey
can easily build an Apple device charger that can infect an iPhone or an iPad. Known for its
high level of security and vetting of apps, Apple devices are seldom compromised by hackers (not so for
Androiddevices). Applehasquicklyrespondedwithanupgradetoclosethesecurityflaw.
The key to compromising an iPhone or an iPad is the fact that
such devices are charged through a USB port. The USB port
supplies not only a provision for charging the internal batteries of
the device but also provides a gateway to the device’s operating
systemandapplications.Thisis,ofcourse,theprimarypurposeof
the USB port – to provide (presumably secure) access to the iOS
internalsforexternaldevices.
The researchers used the USB portal into the devices to infect
them within sixty seconds of being plugged in. Fortunately, there
arenoknowninstancesofthishackbeingusedintherealworld–yet.
The Disclosure
Georgia Tech’s Information Security Center notified Apple in June, 2013, so that Apple could patch its
operatingsystem beforetheresearcherswentpublic withtheirdiscovery.Theresearchersthendescribed
their technique and demonstrated a working proof of concept at the Black Hat USA 2013 security
conference held at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas from July27 through August 1, 2013. Theyplugged an

Their talk was entitled “Mactans: Injecting Malware into iOS Devices via Malicious Chargers.” The
abstractfortheirtalkreadasfollows:
“Apple iOS devices are considered by many to be more secure than other mobile offerings. In
evaluating this belief, we investigated the extent to which security threats were considered when
performing everyday activities such as charging a device. The results were alarming: despite the
plethora of defense mechanisms in iOS, we successfully injected arbitrary software into current-
generation Apple devices running the latest operating system (OS) software. All users are affected,

“In this presentation, we demonstrate how an iOS device can be compromised within one minute of
being plugged into a malicious charger. We first examine Apple’s existing security mechanisms to

To demonstrate practical application of these vulnerabilities, we built a proof of concept malicious
charger, called Mactans, using a BeagleBoard. This hardware was selected to demonstrate the ease
with which innocent-looking, malicious USB chargers can be constructed. While Mactans was built
with limited amount of time and a small budget, we also briefly consider what more motivated, well-
funded adversaries could accomplish. Finally, we recommend ways in which users can protect
themselves and suggest security features Apple could implement to make the attacks we describe
substantiallymoredifficulttopulloff.”
The Malicious Charger
The researchers built their charger using a small $45 BeagleBoard
Linux computer from Texas Instruments. They named their charger

ThoughtheBeagleBoardis quitesmall–aboutthesizeofacreditcard,
it is much too large to fit into an Apple charger casing. It is unlikely
(though not impossible) to be scaled down to the size of an Apple
iPhoneoriPadchargeranytimesoon.
The Attack Methodology
The researchers took advantage of Apple’s developer model. The model allows an enrolled developer to
register a device’s Unique Device Identifier (UDI) to prove that the device is his. The UDI is then used on
an Apple website to take advantage of an Apple uploading tool that allows the developer to download an
appunderdevelopmentsothathecantesthissoftwareonaniOSdevice.
At this point, the developer can install any third-party app on that iPhone or iPad, whether or not the app
hasbeenapprovedbyApple.
The hack proceeds as follows. The hacker first registers with Apple to become a developer. When
plugged into the iDevice, the Mactans malicious charger interrogates the iDevice via the USB port to
obtain its UDI. Mactans then registers the device as the developer’s test device in seconds. At this point,

In the demo, the researchers loaded a fake Facebook app and replaced the real Facebook app with the
fake one. In this way, the iOS had no idea that a malicious app had been installed. The fake Facebook

Apple has thanked the researchers for their important input and has stated that the issue has been
addressed in iOS 7. iOS 7 is currently in Beta testing as of this writing, and Apple has not committed to

Summary
Mactans is an interesting means to infect a device. We don’t usually worry about the access that a

In any event, Mactans does not seem to present an immediate danger. It is unlikely to be packaged to
look like a standard iDevice charger, and is a threat only to the one iDevice it is plugged into and only if
thatdeviceisunlocked.
This is not the first problem Apple has faced with its chargers. Apple is plagued with cheap fake versions
of its chargers. In July, 2013, a Chinese woman was electrocuted bya fake charger. The following week,
a man was shocked into a coma by a fake charger. Apple has now offered to buy back any
iPhone, iPad, or iPod charger not made by Apple and to replace it with an authentic Apple
