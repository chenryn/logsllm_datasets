– Our June Twitter Feed of Outages
June2015
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass.With our new Twitter presence, we don’t
have to feel guilty. This article highlights some of the tweets that made headlines in
recentdays.

NatWest’slatestglitchisaperfectmetaphorofproblemsfacingUKbanks
On Tuesday, 16 June, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan told analysts and investors he wanted
RBS to be the number one bank for customer service in the UK by 2020. That very night, a mere
week after George Osborne said he wanted to return RBS to private ownership, the bank’s IT
systemsmanagedtomisplaceroughly600,000transactions.Nicetiming.

About 600,000 payments that failed to enter the accounts of RBS customers overnight may not be
completed until the end of the week, the bank has said. Customers from RBS, NatWest, Coutts and
Ulster Bank - all part of the same banking group - were affected by the latest issue, which was

Increasingly, government agencies responsible for monitoring hazardous processes, e.g.,
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, are taking advantage of technology to use resources efficiently.
A great example is how the US Geological Survey’s National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC)
in Golden, Colorado, is used as a remote backup location for the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory
(HVO).

ISLAMABAD: Despite having purchased expensive automated data processing and billing

From the Availability Digest: "HP NonStop Servers Migrated to x86"
Fault-tolerant HP NonStop servers have come a long way from their origin as Tandem Computers.
Along the way, NonStop servers have moved from proprietary hardware and software to become
increasingly open, with a Unix-like operating system and support for modern programming
languages. HP has now taken the final step in moving NonStop servers to commodity technology by
migratingthemtoanx86architecture.ThenewserversareknownasHPNonStopX.

The LightSail,the newsolarsail spacecraftlaunched lastweek byBill Nye and hisPlanetarySociety

LightSail consistently sent back a number of data “chirps” to Earth over a two-day period, indicating
its position and other important data about the spacecraft.According to the Planetary Society’s
website, it’s likely that with each additional chirp, the satellite created a file that was too big for the
