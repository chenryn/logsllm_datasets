Going Prices for Personal Information
January2014
Hacking financial data-processing systems to steal credit-card, debit-card, and personal
information has become big business. Not only are hundreds of millions of people put at
financialrisk each year,but thehackersmakebigprofits withoutever using this data.Rather, theysimply
sellitinahackers’blackmarkettoresellers..
Hackers are Successful
Recent indictments against a Russian team1 demonstrate how effective knowledgeable hackers can be.
This group of five individuals operated a prolific hacking operation that was responsible for several of the
largest known data breaches. The team included two who specialized in penetrating corporate computer
networks.Athirdindividual specialized inharvestingdatafrom thepenetratednetworks.Aforthindividual
provided anonymous web-hosting services that were used for the hacking activities. A fifth individual sold
theinformationobtainedfromthehackingactivitiestowillingbuyersaroundtheworld.
During a five-year period, this team was able to steal almost 200 million credit card numbers and related
personalinformation:
 Twomillioncredit-cardnumberswerestolenfromCarrefour,aFrenchmultinationalretailer.
 Over 4 million credit-card numbers were stolen from Hannaford, a regional U.S. supermarket
chain.
 Heartland Payment Systems, one of the world’s largest credit-card and debit-card payments
processors,had130millioncardnumbersstolenandsufferedlossesofUSD$200million.
 Thirty-million card numbers was stolen from the computer networks of Commidea, a provider of
electronicpaymentprocessing.
 Dexia Bank Belgium suffered a large card-number loss that resulted in almost USD $2 million
dollarsinlosses.
 Dow Jones, a publisher of news, business, and financial information, suffered the loss of 10,000

And then there was the recent Target breach in which 110 million credit cards and debit cards were
compromised.
Going Prices for Personal Information
What do these malicious people do with all of these cards? Do they withdraw large sumsfrom ATMs and
make thousands of purchases? No, that is too much work. Rather, theysimplysell the stolen information
toothersinundergroundcybermarketplaces.
Did you know that your birthdate is worth somewhere between USD $11 and USD $25? According to an
investigation by Dell SecureWorks (http://www.secureworks.com), the following are going prices for

Credit card and debit card information is sold to “cashers,” who use the information to write the magnetic
stripes of fake credit cards and debit cards. The fake cards are then used to withdraw cash from ATMs
andtomakeillegalpurchases.
Credit card, debit card, and personal information of non-U.S. citizens sell for more than that of U.S.
citizens.This maybebecauseU.S.systems arebetter protectedthan others aroundthe world.Therefore

to send malicious spam on behalf of other spammers or to launch DDoS attacks. Botnets in Asia tend to
sell for less than those in the U.S. It is thought that this is because the U.S. provides a faster and more
reliableInternetconnection.
DDoS attacks are probably becoming the major availabilitythreat to companies’ online services. Hackers

Doxing is another service provided by hackers, Doxing involves getting all of the information possible
about a victim. Doxing methods include searching public information sites and social media sites and
manipulating the victim via social engineering, infecting them with an information-stealing Trojan. Doxing
feesrangefrom$25to$100pervictim.
For the future, there is no shortage of hackers willing to do almost anything computer-related for money.

Protecting Yourself
The means to protect your sensitive data are well known but not always followed. Organizations should
employ firewalls, intrusion protection systems for networks and hosts, and malware protection software.
They should scan for vulnerabilities and monitor their logs on a 24x7 basis. Sensitive data and emails
should be encrypted in-place and in-flight. Organizations should educate their employees to never click
on email links or attachments without checking with the sender first. Email and web surfing are the two
majorinfectionvectors.
Individuals should avoid clicking on email links or attachments from untrusted sources. They should
ensure that their antivirus software is maintained up-to-date, as should all updates to other applications
theyuse.Freesoftware or trialsoftwareshouldnotbe installed.Bankingstatements andcardstatements
should be reconciled on a periodic basis to make sure that there has been no unauthorized activity. An
interesting suggestion is to use a separate computer dedicated to online banking and bill paying. This
computershouldnotbeusedforemailorwebsurfing.
Summary
Hackers are clever and resourceful. Whatever protections we put in place, it does not seem long before
they have worked out ways to circumvent them. And they have good reason to do so. A theft of even a
modest amount of personal information can mean big payments to them. Imagine stealing the data for
onemillioncreditcardsandsellingthisdataat$4percard-$4milliondollarsoverandoverasthedatais
soldtomoreandmoreresellers.
The protections we have against this malicious activity are well-known but not always followed. It is
important that organizations and individuals incorporate protective actions in their everyday life. Perhaps
the key actions are for organizations to encrypt sensitive data in-place and in-flight and for individuals to
avoidclickingonemaillinksandattachmentsfromunknownsources.
