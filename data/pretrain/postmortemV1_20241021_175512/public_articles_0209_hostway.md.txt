Hostway’s Web Hosting Service Down for Days
September2007
Hostwayis one of the largest web site hosting services in the world. When Hostwayattempted to
move 3,700 servers of the Miami data center of a recently acquired company to its own facilities
in Tampa, Florida, the servers suffered multiple failures in transit. The result was that the web
sites of 500 customers, many of them small online stores, were down for days. A week later,
severalcustomerswerestilldown.
What went wrong? Where were the proper data and application migration techniques? What
could Hostway have done to avoid the problem? Let us look at this horribly failed migration and
attempttoanswerthesequestions.
Hostway
Founded in 1998, Hostway Corporation provides web site hosting services for over 400,000
businesses worldwide. A customer may choose to use dedicated hosting, in which case it is
provided its own dedicated server by Hostway; or it may choose the less expensive shared
hostingservice,inwhichcaseitsharesaserverwithothercustomers.
Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Hostway has over $100,000,000 invested in network
infrastructure. Hostway is truly a global enterprise and maintains data centers at twelve sites
worldwide, including Chicago, Tampa, Austin, Vancouver, Seoul, London, Paris, Frankfurt,
Hanover,andSydney.ItalsohasoperationsinAntwerp.Amsterdam,Bucharest,andMumbai.
Its data centers utilize fully redundant environments, including redundant HVAC systems and
diesel generators. Hostway configures its data centers to provide four 9s of availability to its
customers.

The Hostway/Affinity Merger
InAprilof 2007,HostwayacquiredAffinityInternet,another majorwebsitedeveloper andhosting
service. Via its ValueWeb hosting service, Affinity hosted web sites for over 3,000 customers on
the3,700serverslocatedinitsMiamidatacenter.
The Planned Data Center Migration
Inorder toimproveservice toits newlyacquiredValueWebcustomers,Hostwaydecidedtomove
the Affinity data center from its Miami location to Hostway’s major data center in Tampa. The
Tampa data center had significantlymore capacityand better network connectivity to the Internet
backbone than Affinity’s Miami center. The move would result in significantly improved service to
theValueWebcustomers.
Migrations such as this had been accomplished successfully by Hostway several times in the
past,andtherewaslittledoubtthatthismigrationwouldgojustassmoothly.
The move was planned to take place over the weekend of July 27, and Hostway anticipated that
the affected web sites would be down for 12 to 15 hours while the servers and other equipment
weretransportedandreinstalled.Hostwaynotifieditsaffectedcustomersbyemailandstated
“…The12–15houroutagewilltakeplacebeginningthisFriday,July27th,at8PMEDT.The

PM, youshouldexpect your server to be back online between8 AMand 11 AM onSaturday,

According to plan, at 8 PM on July 27th, Hostway began the process of powering down,
disconnecting,packing,loading,moving,repositioning,reconnecting,andtestingtheserversprior

What Went Terribly Wrong?
It is not difficult to see the storm clouds forming. This was not a graceful migration – it was a “big
bang” migration. All service was shut down and the data center moved with the full expectation
thatservicewouldberestoredassoonastheserverswerebroughtonlineinthenewdatacenter.
But that was not to happen. The primary problem was that there were many, many more server
failuresinducedbythemovethananyonehadanticipated.Theresultwasthatservicerestoration
wasdelayed,notbyhours,butbydays.1
Many of the failed servers suffered from hardware failures – especially hard drive failures. There
were spares on hand in Tampa to correct such hardware failures, but not nearly enough. In
addition, networking configuration problems prevented other servers from being brought online.

Its call center was overloaded, causing many complaints that Hostway was not answering its
service lines. It was not answering email sent in by anxious customers. In fact, there was little in
the way of customer communication except a voicemail message that was only occasionally
updated and a brief update posted daily on its web site2 (yes, Hostway’s web site was still
working).
Accordingtothepostings onits website, whichamountedtotwoor threeshortparagraphs every
other day or so starting on Tuesday, July 31, about 250 servers were still down on Tuesday
(threedays after theywere firstshutdown).ByThursday,this number was reducedto50;andby
Saturday,August4,oneweeklater,abouttwentyserverswerestilldown.
Most of the customers that were affected were those using dedicated hosting services. Each
failed server represented one customer. Therefore, about 500 customers experienced multiple-
dayoutages.Manyoftheseweresmallonlinestoresthatwereliterallyoutofbusinessduringthat

The Cost to Hostway
The cost to Hostway of this fiasco is not known to the general public. However, numerous blogs
notedthenumber ofcustomers whowereconsideringmovingtoother hostingsites.Thepublicity
hasbeenhorrible.TherewasapopularthreadontheDiggdiscussionforum3entitled“HowNotto
MoveaDataCenter.”
Hostway’s costs are varied. They range from bad publicity in the press and on the blogs to lost
customers and perhaps even to lawsuits brought by the online stores that lost days worth of
business. Whatever forms it may take, what is certain is that the costs of this botched migration
maybeextreme.
Lessons Learned
This was a “big bang” migration gone wrong. There are several strategies that Hostway could
have used to ensure a more orderly migration. I am sure that none of these are news to the
Hostwaystaff.Theconsiderationsmayhavebeenmorefinancialthantechnical.
 First of all, it is unconscionable to plan to shut down online store customers in this 24x7
worldfor hours atatimewithoutconsulting withthose customers.Itappears thattheonly
noticethatthosecustomersreceivedwastheemailquotedpreviously.
 The migration could have taken place incrementally over a longer period of time. True, if
only200 of the 3,000 customers were migrated per week, it would have taken about four
months to do the migration rather than one weekend. But then the spare parts
complement and the availability of technical staff would have been substantially more
adequatetohandleanyproblems.
 Evidently,Hostwaydoes notprovidebackupsites.However,it is likelythat there is spare
capacityintheir datacenters worldwide.Theproper wayto do amigrationsuch as this is
to first move a customer’s hosting service to another site, make sure that it is up and
running on the new server, and then move the original server, returning the hosting
service to that server after it has been reinstalled and thoroughlytested. There are some
operational problems with this, such as getting the customer to agree to provide the

permissions required to move his site; but this is minor compared to dealing with an irate
customerwhohasbeendownfordays.
 It seems that there was no fallback plan to cover cases of massive migration failure.
Perhaps it was deemed that the chance for such a failure was too small to make this
exerciseworthwhile.Wrong!!
 It is noteworthy that an operation as large as Hostway does not support a backup site.
Withtwelve datacenters worldwide,onlyone data center at athirteenth location need be
configured to back up any one of the operational data centers. Then the applications and
the databases of the servers to be migrated could be transferred to the backup data
center for the period of the move. A backup data center is expensive, but its cost may
pale in comparison to the costs associated with a massive outage such as that
experiencedbyHostwayinthismove.
And speaking of a backup site. A major data center in “hurricane alley” with no backup? Come
on!
