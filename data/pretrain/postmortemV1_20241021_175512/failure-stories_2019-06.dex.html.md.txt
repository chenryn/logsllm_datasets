# A kubernetes failure story (#1)

k8s meetup at
[NMBRS](https://www.meetup.com/Dutch-Kubernetes-Meetup/events/262313920/)

## The setting

Kubernetes authentication

-   Dex
-   OIDC \"proxy\"
-   Storage backends

## Config

                  
    config:
      storage:
        type: kubernetes
        config:
          inCluster: true
                  
                

## The problem

Bad defaults

-   AKA \"stop hitting yourself\"
-   Insane TTL
-   Refreshing dashboards
-   Actual security bug

### I got these hints earlier..

## Now i got \$x AuthRequests

-   How TF do i clean this up?!
-   Listing all authrequests times out
-   Kinda need that to delete the resources

## What would you do?

1.  Tweak timeouts in etcd/apiserver
2.  Delete namespace and let k8s clean up for us
3.  Bypass k8s and delete resources in etcd
4.  (did i miss any?)

## Whats behind door number two?

![](img/k8sparty.gif) is
magic, The End


## Reconciliation loops

-   List all requests in order to delete
-   Timeout
-   Repeat
-   Masters load spikes to 60


## New situation

Royally screwed

-   Masters down
-   Can\'t access monitoring (no auth, no port-forward)
-   Plenty of alerts in slack though..

## Dirty tricks

                  
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: dex
    spec:
      finalizers:
      - kubernetes
    status:
      phase: Active
                  
                

You cant actually remove that finalizer with kubectl

-   Go directly through API and do not pass go
-   <https://github.com/ctron/kill-kube-ns>
-   **NEVER DO THIS**

# NEVER DO THIS

## That \"fixed\" it

-   Still left with 0.5G of authrequests in etcd
-   Fairly confident

    kubectl create namespace dex

    kills the cluster
-   Deployed dex to new namespace with SANE DEFAULTS
