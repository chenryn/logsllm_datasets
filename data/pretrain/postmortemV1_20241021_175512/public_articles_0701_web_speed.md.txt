Retail Web Sites Lose Millions to Slow Response Time
January2012
The recent Black Fridayand Cyber Monday brought grief to manyretail sites. American Eagle was down
intermittently for eight hours between Wednesday and Monday. Crutchfield, Brookstone, and Victoria’s
Secret were down for an hour or so. Toys”R”Us, Avon, and Crate and Barrel had approximately a half
hourofdowntime.
None of these companies identified the reason for their failures. But given the significantly increased
shopping activity during this time, it is likely that many were caused by unanticipated, heavy website
loading.
As serious as these outages were to brand loyalty and to revenues, they may be hiding an even more
insidious problem – website performance. Site outages may make the headlines, but slow website
response may be the silent enemy #1. No one talks about this, but as performance expert Lenny
Rachitskysays:
“Downtime is better for a B2C [business-to-consumer] web service than slowness. Slowness makes
youhateusingtheservice;downtimeyoujusttryagainlater.”
The Impact of Website Responsiveness
Though not reaching the attention of the press, website performance has attracted a great deal of
industryattention.Severalimportantmetricshavebeendevelopedfromtwoareasofstudy:
 User experience research, which looks into how we use the web and why we react the way

 E-commerce research, which identifies the relationship between website performance and

A 2010 study by Akamai Technology found that 57% of site visitors will abandon the site after waiting

Aberdeen Group interviewed 160 companies and found that a one-second increase in page load time
resulted in a 7% reduction in conversions. For a site that earns $100,000 per day, this is $2.5 million per

Shopzilla reduced its website page load time from 6 seconds to 1.2 seconds. This resulted in a 25%
increase in pageviews and a12% increaseinrevenue.Amazonmeasuredthatfor every100millisecond

It seems from these studies that subpar performance might cost a company every bit as much as
downtime – perhaps more since poor performance is an ongoing problem rather than an occasional,
unlikelyproblem.
How Fast is Fast Enough?
Jakob Nielsen has spent seventeen years studying web usage. He argues that a fast user experience is
better than a flashy one. People want to move quickly and focus on content rather than wait for
entertainingpagestoload.

 After ten seconds, people start thinking of other things, making it difficult to resume their tasks at

A study by Forrester Research confirms these observations. It found that users could stretch their

Another study by Zona Research came to the same conclusion. Over the last decade, Zona has been
testing the expectations of users. In 1999, they found that users would live with an eight-second page
load time. In 2006, this expectation was reduced to four seconds. In 2009, users were uncomfortable if

How Are the Major Retail Sites Doing?
During the 2010 holidays, several performance measurements were made of the top 500 and the top
2,000 retail web sites. The measurements showed a striking difference, with page load time ranging from
twotothirtyseconds.
Amongthefastestretailwebsiteswere:
Amazon 2.9seconds

BestBuy 4.4seconds
Netflix 4.4seconds

Sears 22.6seconds
Macy’s 21.2seconds

The best web sites were well within the one- to ten-second range of acceptable page load time, with

Where Are the Bottlenecks?

problems.
 Back-endservercapacityandoverloadingduringpeaktimes.
 Third-party content – ads and widgets that are optimized for visual appeal rather than for
performance.
Summary
These insights into how poor website performance impacts revenues and customer loyalty raise some
critical questions. Do retailers understand the cost of poor performance? Do they have a stated
performance goal for their web sites? Do they have a clear sense of how to go about making their sites
faster?
