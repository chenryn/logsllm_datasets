Power outage disruptsFoxtelecast of World Series
The Fox Sports telecast of Game One of the World Series in Kansas City was knocked off the air
due to a "rare electronics failure." The roughly 20-minute outage happened when a broadcast truck
lost power. "Before the start of the bottom of the fourth inning ... a rare electronics failure caused
both the primary and backup generators inside the Fox Sports production compound to lose power,"
Fox Sports said in a statement. The glitch caused a seven-minute delay on the field as Major
League Baseball officials waited for it to be fixed in order to deliver the telecast to replay officials in
NewYork.

Power Grid RemainsIll Prepared forFuture Hurricanes, Study Shows
Three years after Hurricane Sandy devastated the East Coast, key electrical infrastructure remains
vulnerable to flooding in major storms. A recent study by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS)
says millions of Americans living along the East and Gulf coasts would likely lose power in a
Category 3 hurricane. Sandy left more than 8 million people across 21 states without power and
caused billions of dollars in damage when power plants and major electrical substations were
inundatedbyitsstormsurge.

One of the AvailabilityDigest's Most Popular Articles: Fire Suppression Suppresses WestHost for
Days.
Saturday, February 20, 2010 - It’s not a good idea to test a fire-suppression system by triggering it.
But that’s what happened to WestHost, a major web-hosting provider headquartered in Utah. The
accidental release of a blast of fire-suppressant gas severely damaged most of its servers and data
stores. Hardware repair and database recovery efforts putWestHost’s customers out of commission
foruptosixdays.

SecurityArchitectureBuildsBridgestoaSecureNetwork
Manufacturers know that you can’t build on a weak foundation and expect a product to stand up
over time, but many don’t realize the same principle applies to computer networks. To ensure
yours is built and running on a stable structure, you need to look at your security architecture.
