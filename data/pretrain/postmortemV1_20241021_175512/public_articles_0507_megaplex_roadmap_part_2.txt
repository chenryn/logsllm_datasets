RBC used SOAP/AM from NuWave Technologies to create its RIMMS SOA environment. RBC
downloaded a trial version of the product and within 30 minutes was building SOA objects via
intuitive browser screens. RBC went on to replace its green screens with modern GUIs, and it
interfaced RIMMS with its Unix-based treasury applications. Today, RBC has a fully functioning

Step 4: Availability Modernization
MovingtoContinuousUptime
Availability modernization involves moving from the traditional availability- and disaster-recovery
methods toa readiness program.Fullyimplementedreadiness programs arecomprehensiveand
cover people, systems, processes, applications, databases, communications, and the many
interdependenciesbetweenthem.
The centerpiece of a readiness program is an active/active system. An active/active system
comprises two or more independent processing nodes cooperating in a commonapplication. The
databasecopies ateachnodearekeptinsynchronism viadatareplication.Shouldanodefail,all
thatneedstobedoneistoreroutefurthertransactionstosurvivingnodes.
An active/active configuration does away with nonproductive chores such as testing and
certification because by its nature, the active/active system is always up-to-date; and all of its
nodes are being continually tested. Active/active systems also eliminate planned downtime since
upgradescanberolledthroughthenodesonebyone.
Active/active benefits include greater overall availability, reduced costs, less planning, and higher
readiness. The heart of an active/active system is the data-replication engine used to keep the
databases in synchronism. The data-replication engine can also be used to integrate various
heterogeneoussystemsandtomigrateapplicationsfromoneenvironmenttoanother.

AOL–ACaseStudy
More than 40 million people have AOL email and instant messaging
accounts. Therefore, AOL services must be continuously available. Several
years ago,AOLfacedaserious problem.Its loginsystem was runningoutof
capacity and experiencing some downtime. AOL feared that at any time its users might not be
abletologin.
AOL initiated a project in 2006 to replace its login system with an ultra-reliable system. There
weretwoconstraintsonthismove:
 Thesystemcouldnotbedownduringthemigrationorcutover.
 The system had to be financially viable and provide disaster tolerance for the required
capacity.
AOL’s first step was to evaluate major hardware and database vendors. Only the HP NonStop
system met AOL’s rigorous performance and scaling requirements. AOL planned a four-node
NonStop active/active system to replace its old login system with one that provided continuous
availability.
Its next step was to migrate its old Login Request Complex to the new active/active system. This
involvedmovingamassivedatabaseofabillionrowstotheNonStopdatabase.TheShadowbase
data-replication engine from Gravic, Inc., was chosen not only to implement the NonStop
active/active system but also to do the data migration. Six software developers and database
administrators from AOL and the replication-engine vendor worked over a period of eighteen
months to gradually migrate the database according to a detailed plan, and they did so with no
userdowntime.
AOL’s active/active approach minimized the need for ongoing disaster recovery and testing and
significantly reduced the system’s server footprint. AOL estimates an annual savings in people,
power,andlicensingcostsofabout$1million.
Step 5: Security Modernization
MovingtoProactiveSecurityProtection
Security modernization means moving from the traditional passive security monitoring to
proactive protection. Government and industry regulations such as SOX, HIPPA, and PCI
mandatemuchofthischange.
The security process can be very complex, as companies seek to protect hundreds of assets.
One wayto simplifythe security process is to deploy a centralized securitymanagement system.
In the NonStop world, the fundamental security mechanism is Safeguard. A proper, centralized
managementsystemthatincludesNonStopserversmustintegratewellwithSafeguard.
Over half of organizations have an active program to implement centralized security
management. However, of these, about half cannot satisfy auditors demands’ to meet the
security compliance goals. To do so requires highly sophisticated software to address all key
areasofauthentication,authorization,accesscontrol,accountability,administration,andaudit.

Wells Fargo uses a three-level security technical-support organization. The first level is a help
desk. The second level manages the security products and services used by the bank. The third
level follows state-of-the-art securitytools and techniques and ensures that the bank is operating
atthehighestlevelofsecuritybestpractices.
Wells Fargo’s NonStop systems include twenty-one nodes spread across six data centers.
Applications include ATM network management, wholesale banking, international funds transfer,
and mortgage tracking, all of which come under security-compliance regulations. It is the job of
the third level of security support to ensure that the security products meet or exceed the
complianceandauditingrequirementsofthebank.
Prior to the merger, Wells Fargo and Wachovia both used XYGATE from XYPRO Technology
Corporation for their NonStop systems. Wells Fargo continues in this tradition. XYGATE is used
for managing and tracking system security privileges, enforcing password quality, managing
accesscontrol,andauditing,amongothersecuritytasks.
Step 6: Operational Modernization
MovingtoaMatrixInfrastructure
Operational modernization requires moving from vertical structures to a matrix structure using
horizontal service views. The intent is to run the service at the right service level to balance cost
and availability. Services that require high availability, security, and data integrity will operate in
one space (typically in NonStop servers), whereas services that do not maintain state or that do
nothaveahighvaluewilloperateinalessreliableserviceareaatlowercost.
Operational personnel will generally not know nor care where the service takes place. They will
beprovidedwithauniformoperationalmanagementsystem acrossallservices.This capabilityis
foundinHP’sSystemsInsightManager(SIM)withNonStopEssentials.
SIM provides hardware and software management for NonStop servers, other HP systems, and
non-HP systems including IBM mainframes. It automates routine operator tasks such as
monitoring, recovery, provisioning, startup, and shutdown. SIM’s graphical user displays help
operatorsrespondquicklyandaccuratelytosituationswherehumaninterventionisrequired.
VocaLink–ACaseStudy
VocaLink provides ATM and POS payment transaction services
for banks, large corporations, and government agencies. It
handles over a half-billion payments a month with peak daily
volumesof90milliontransactions.
In 2000, the British government ordered the banks to reduce payment times. In response,
VocaLink developed the Faster Payments System (FPS) on NonStop servers. FPS has cut the
transferofpaymentsfromthreedaystominutes.
VocaLink currently operates thirteen NonStop nodes with 80 CPUs. However, the tremendous
transaction volume handled byVocaLink put a strain on its operations staff due to increased cost
and training. Its staff was managing all of the systems and applications with old error-prone,
command-line technology. Furthermore, system management was on a node-by-node basis,
requiringactiononallthirteennodesevenforglobalactions.
To modernize its operations, VocaLink installed SIM so that it could monitor its entire NonStop
complex, including servers, storage, and operating-system components, as a single system.

The Standish Group’s Rapid Performance Measurement (RPM) service benchmarks and
assesses the project management skills of its clients. RPM uses the critical success factors
determined by its CHAOS studies and surveys to evaluate the best practices in the client’s
project-delivery organization. The result is a comparison of the client’s success rate in terms of
cost and time overruns and feature deficiency rates with those of 70,000 projects from 1,000
organizationsstudiedoverthepastsixteenyears.
