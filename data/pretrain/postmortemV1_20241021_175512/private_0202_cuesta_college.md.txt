Community College Learns From SAN Disaster
February2007
Cuesta College, a large community college in California, stored all of its critical data on a
redundant SAN.It was satisfiedthat the SAN’s redundancywould protectthe datain theeventof
a component failure.Whatit did not anticipate was a failover fault. The SAN controller failed, and
the failover was faulty. The result – two days of hard downtime and several weeks cleaning up
stray problems. Now a dually redundant SAN provides the data protection the College originally
sought.
Cuesta College
Cuesta College (www.cuesta.edu) is a public community college
offering dozens of associate degree and certificate programs. The
subject areas covered by these degree and certificate programs
range from a variety of technologies to marketing, business, social
sciences,paralegal,nursing,music,fashion,andmanyothers.
CuestaCollegeis locatedinSanLuisObispoincentralCaliforniaona150-acrecampusnearthe
Pacific Ocean. It has an additional campus in Paso Robles, California, and centers in the Arroyo
GrandeandNipomoHighSchools,alsoinCalifornia.
The college has a ninety-year history, having started out as a division of San Luis Obispo High
Schoolin1916.In1964,itbecamepartoftheSanLuisObispoCountyJuniorCollegeDistrictand
offered evening courses at a California National Guard facility. In 1965, the college was officially
namedCuestaCollege;anditbrokegroundforitscurrentcampusin1970.1
The College now serves over 10,000 students at its two campuses in San Luis Obispo and Paso
Robles. It has over 500 full-time and part-time faculty members and is part of the California
Community Colleges system. It is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and
Colleges.
The Growth of IT Services
As with most enterprises, Cuesta’s dependence on data processing technology has evolved over
the years to the point that it is now totally dependent upon its systems. The data which supports
these operations are measured in terabytes. Various services are provided by twenty-odd

A few years ago, the College consolidated its data
processing operations by acquiring a two-terabyte
storage area network (SAN). The SAN is linked to the
various servers via fiber channel and provides storage
for all of the mission-critical files and databases that
had previously been directly attached to the servers.
These mission-critical applications include

to protect the data, which is so necessary to the
operation of the College. It uses RAID arrays for the
storage media and uses dual SAN controllers in an
disk active/backup configuration. If a disk fails, the RAID
array array continues in operation. The failed disk can be
replaced while the system is operational and can be

The Cuesta IT staff had done its homework. The College’s data was protected by a redundant

The Failover Fault
The IT staff’s confidence was rooted in the knowledge that should a component fail, there was
another one available to instantly take its place. This is called failover. What it hadn’t counted on
was the possibility, although remote, that the failover wouldn’t work. This is known as a failover
fault.3

Losing access to the system’s data for two full days and then having only sporadic access
seriously impacted important school operations. Many applications such as email were totally
down. Servers running Active Directory, DNS (Domain Name Service), clustering services, and
SQL 2000 were affected. Faculty and administrators could not get to their data. Fortunately,
students were not affected since it was the school’s practice not to provide students with

It was realized that future failures such as this would only be worse since the school’s data was
growing at a rate of approximately25% per year. A better solution for database protection had to
befound.
FalconStor to the Rescue
The IT staff found its solution in IPStor, a product from FalconStor (www.falconstor.com). IPStor
is a fullyredundant virtualization appliance for implementing SANs and NASs across multivendor
and multiplatform environments. It provides a centralized management interface for these
environments.

Not only does IPStor provide redundant controllers, it provides dual connections (one from each
controller) to the disk arrays. It is hardware-agnostic, running on a variety of platforms under
Linux or Solaris. IPStor supports mirroring, replication, snapshot copies and several other
functions.
Cuesta initiallyused IPStor’s mirroring capabilities. It purchased two IPStor appliances to provide
additional redundancy in case one of the redundant appliances failed. This configuration, in fact,
provided four independent connections to the disk arrays. Data was now mirrored on separate
diskarraysforaddedprotection.
As Murphy would have it, the central SAN array, which had been repaired and certified for return
to service, failed again before the full installation of the FalconStor arrays had been completed.
However, this time the result was far different. The mirror copies were promoted to primary
storage, and service was restored in about four hours. Some data was lost, but the impact was
negligible.TheschoolsincehasaddednewSANdiskstoaugmenttheinitialtroublesomearrays.
Since then, the SAN’s primaryarrayfailed for athirdtime.This time,IPStor was fullyoperational;
and failover occurred with no user impact. Best of all, no data was lost. The only way the IT staff
knewthattherehadbeenafailurewasfromthelogs.

Improved Backup as a Plus
Withtheeverincreasingamountofdata,Cuestafound
that it was struggling with its backup procedures to
tape. As data volume grew and as access
requirements began to extend into the evening hours,
the IT staff found it increasingly difficult to complete its
tapebackupsintheever-shrinkingovernightwindow.
The solution was found in FalconStor’s snapshot
capabilities. Cuesta purchased FalconStor’s
TimeMark,whichtakesefficientincrementalsnapshots
and stores them on a SAN storage array. Typically, a
transaction-consistent dump of the database is taken
on the weekend when traffic is light. Thereafter,
TimeMark can be invoked to quickly take a snapshot
of only the data that has changed. A TimeMark
snapshot is fast enough that these incremental
snapshots can be taken quite frequently, such as
hourly.
Cuesta uses TimeMark to take snapshots during the ever shortening overnight window. As a
consequence, it can now leisurely back up its database to tape from the snapshot even during
heavyusagetimeswithoutaffectingproductionservices.
Summary
Cuesta College learned the hard way about failover faults in redundant systems that aren’t
supposedtofail(atleast,hardlyever).Injustahandfulof years,ithasexperiencedthreefaultsin
itsredundantSANhardware.
The first one was disastrous. Since then, the College has added redundant backup to its
redundant systems. The subsequent failures were handled without any substantial impact. The
second failure occurred before the implementation of its dually redundant solution was complete.
Even in that circumstance, the College experienced a delay of only a few hours and little data
loss.
The third failure occurred after the implementation was complete. That failure was hardly noticed
