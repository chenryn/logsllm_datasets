Most IT pros have experienced the dreaded war room meeting that immediately starts after an
outage to a critical application or service. But how do you avoid it? It’s more than building
redundancyanddisasterrecoveryintosystems.

Howahacker'stypohelpedstopabilliondollarbankheist
A spelling mistake in an online bank transfer instruction helped prevent a nearly $1 billion heist last
month involving the Bangladesh central bank and the New York Federal Reserve. Unknown
hackers still managed to get away with about $80 million, one of the largest known bank thefts in
history. Four requests to transfer a total of about $81 million to the Philippines went through; but a
fifth for $20 million to a Sri Lankan non-profit organization was held up because the hackers

TTCneedsmorereliablepowertoavoidchaos
The March 1st commuter chaos that crippled transit in downtown Toronto (Canada) is just
another symptom of a complex system failure. Yet another underground power vault failed,
cutting electricity to most of the city’s downtown core subway and streetcar lines. Madness
ensued. That Canada’s most critical transit system can be put out of service by one small fire is
evidence the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) does not have an adequate business continuity
plan. There should be redundant alternative sources of electricity for the transit lines.

MIT,UMass Scientiststo StudySolar-Powered DataCenters
Renewable energy is tricky to use in data centers, which have to operate around the clock,
regardless of whether the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. For data center operators that have
turned to renewable energy, the three answers have been a) using a combination of renewable
generation and energy storage to supplement a data center’s power supply, not replace it; b)
investing in renewable energy generation for the same grid that feeds the data center – the grid that
also has coal, nuclear, and other traditional energy sources; and c) simply buying Renewable
Energy Credits equivalent to some or all energy a data center consumes. Researchers behind an
experimental project in Massachusetts (U.S. state) hope to push the progress further by studying
overtimetheperformanceofasolar-poweredmicrodatacenterlaunchedinFebruary.
