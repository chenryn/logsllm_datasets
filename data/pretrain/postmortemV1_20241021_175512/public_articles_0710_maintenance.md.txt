Is Preventive Maintenance Preventive?
October2012
The Perils of Maintenance
Our Never Again stories are ripe with major IT failures caused by poorly performed maintenance.
WestHost is a major web-hosting and domain-registration company. Its IT systems are housed in a
certified SAS 70 Type II data center. Yet it was brought down by the failure of a technician to disable a
fire suppression system actuator during a routine preventive maintenance test.1 The piercing noise from
the sirens damaged many disks, including some backup disks that were in the same facility. It took up to
sixdaystorestoreallservices,andsomedatawasirretrievablylost.
An Availability Zone in Amazon’s U.S. East Region’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) was taken down for
four days when maintenance to increase the capacity of the Availability Zone’s primary internal network
capacity went terribly awry.2 Rather than rerouting traffic to an alternate high-capacity primary network,
traffic was rerouted to a slower secondary network. This effectively isolated the processing nodes in the
Zonefrom their datanodes andledto a“remirroringstorm” during whichtheprocessingnodes attempted

BlackBerry subscribers lost communications for a day when their systems were upgraded to “improve
cache performance” with no fall back plan.3 A major European company mistakenly took down both
nodes of an active/active system while attempting to upgrade the capacity of one of the nodes.4 The $38
billion Alaska Permanent Fund database was wiped out bya maintenance technician working on the disk
system.5 Several IT systems of the State of Virginia were down for seven days, and four days of data

What About Preventive Maintenance?
It is estimated that humans have contributed in some way or another to about 70% of all major IT
outages. Maintenance functions comprise a large number of these incidents. Maintenance for repair and
upgrade purposes must be done. But what about preventive maintenance? Preventive maintenance is
optional, though generally considered a best practice. However, WestHost went down in a spectacular
waybecauseofapreventivemaintenanceerror.WaspreventivemaintenanceworthittoWestHost?
The value of preventive maintenance received attention at the 2011 Fall Conference of the 24x7
Exchange held in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S.A. The 7x24 Exchange is a forum for those who design, build,
use, and maintain mission-critical enterprise information infrastructures. In his keynote address, Steve
Fairfax, the president of MTechnology, addressed this issue. MTechnology provides risk-assessment
servicesforhighlyavailableelectricalpowersuitableforITfacilities.
In his address,7 Fairfax argued that a vigorous maintenance schedule can actually make a facility less
reliable. “There’s this mantra that more maintenance equals more reliability,” he submitted. “We get the
perception that lots of testing improves component reliability. It does not. The most common threat to
reliability is excessive maintenance. The purpose of maintenance should be to find defects and remove
them.Andwheneverapieceofequipmentisundergoingmaintenance,yourdatacenterislessreliable.”
His views were echoed by other speakers. The Executive Director of Uptime Institute, Pitt Turner, said
that he was in “violent agreement” with Fairfax on the risks of excessive maintenance. “Think about what
preventive maintenance programs are appropriate,“ he said. “Do them and do them well using best
practices to lower your risk.” The Uptime Institute offers education, consulting, and data center tier-
certificationservices
Others forcibly disagreed. In a comment posted to a summaryof Fairfax’s speech, Henry Hu of Emerson
Network Power, a company providing mission-critical power and cooling solutions, referenced a detailed
study done by his company8 on the effectiveness of preventive maintenance to maximize the availability
of UPS systems and the battery systems upon which they depend. The study covered 185 million
operating hours for more than 5,000 UPS units and more than 450 million operating hours for 24,000
batteryinstallations.
The company’s research found that the MTBF (mean time between failures) for units that received two
preventive maintenance service events a year was 23 times greater than those that received no
maintenance, provided that the maintenance was performed by a factory-trained service engineer. It
found that a maintenance error by one of their service engineers caused an outage in only one out of
5,000serviceevents.
Emerson’s analysis did show that there was a limit to the number of service events per year after which
the availability of the systems decreased. If factory-trained service technicians were not used, this
thresholdwasmuchlower.
The Most Critical Preventive Maintenance Testing - Failover
One very important preventive maintenance function for IT systems is the testing of failover to a disaster
recovery(DR) system.This is a verycomplex andriskytask that is often not performedcompletelyor not
atall.Theresultisthatwhenaproductionsystem fails,thereisasignificantlikelihoodthattheDRsystem
will not come up. In our Never Again stories, this has been experienced by Google, American Eagle,
BlackBerry,andothers.

The best way to test failover is to failover and stay. Reverse the roles of the production system and DR
systems periodically and stay that way until the next test. The Mayo clinic follows this procedure,

Summary
Corrective maintenance is mandatory. Preventive maintenance is optional. All maintenance can cause
outages.Itis estimatedthat70% of allIT outages havebeenaggravatedbyhumanactions.Maintenance
errors dominate these. Preventive maintenance procedures must be carefullycontrolled so that an action

We invest a lot of money into our data centers to make them redundant so that any single failure can be
tolerated.Whynotdothesameforthe70%problem-humans?Ifthereisacriticaloperationthatmustbe
performed for maintenance, whether corrective or preventive, provide human redundancy. Use two
people,onetodefinetheactiontobetakenandonetoconfirmit.
So far as preventive maintenance is concerned, it seems that the consensus is that a little goes a long
way.Justdon’toverdoit.
