Wells Fargo (www.wellsfargo.com) has always been a
pioneer.Remember thePonyExpress thatdelivered mailby
horseback to the Wild West in the mid- to late 1800s? That
service was run byWells Fargo, a company formed in 1852
toprovidebankingandexpressservicestoCalifornia. In1905,WellsFargoseparateditsbanking
and express operations; and in 1918, as a wartime measure, the U.S. Government nationalized
the express operation, which became the Railway Express Agency and which has since been
privatized.
Wells Fargo is now one of the Big Four banks in the United States, joining Bank of America,
Citigroup, and JP Morgan Chase. Wells Fargo operates more than 6,600 branches and 12,000
ATMsforits43millioncustomers.
The Early ATM Days
As in the stagecoach days, Wells Fargo has been a pioneer in bringing banking convenience to
its customers. It was an early adopter of ATM technology and worked tirelessly to make ATM
services highly available to its customers. To ensure availability, the bank implemented its ATM
networkwithafault-tolerantTandemsystem,locatedinitsSanFranciscodatacenter.
But an ATM is not in itself a reliable component. The bank’s initial thrust was to make its ATM
machines as reliable as possible. However, in the late 1980s, it realized that there was a
diminishing return in improving the availabilityof the individual machines themselves. There were
just too many things that could go wrong, such as cash depletion, jammed cash drawers, and
networkfailures.
Consequently, Wells Fargo changed its focus from machine availability to location availability.
Machines were going to fail – this was a fact that had to be accepted. But if another operating
machine was right next to it, the customer could easily use it instead and not be inconvenienced.
Thisislocationavailability.
Active/Active ATM Availability
At every location that Wells Fargo had an ATM, the bank installed a second one. It provided two
ATM networks, with each ATM at a location being connected to a different network. One network
connected its ATMs to the Tandem system in the existing data center in San Francisco; and the

other network connected its ATMs to an identical Tandem system in a new data center built by
thebankinElMonte,nearLosAngelesinSouthernCalifornia.
The ATM application, called Retail Delivery System (RDS), was custom-built by the bank – the
popularthird-partyapplication,Base24,wasnotused.
SynchronizingtheDatabases
Each data center had a full copy of the customer database. The bank’s IT staff implemented its
own replication facility called “Duplicate DB,” abbreviated “Dup DB.” (this was well before the
days of commercial data-replication engines). Dup DB replicated each transaction to the other
data center with an SLA of twentyseconds. The intent was that if a customer made a transaction
at ATM-a, by the time his card was returned and could be inserted into ATM-b just three feet
away,thetransactionwasalreadyrecordedinbothsystems.
Dupe DB was initiallysingle-threaded, but a multithreaded version followed less than a year later

EliminatingDataCollisions

was locked in both systems. The system servicing the ATM being used locked its copy of the
account and authorized the transaction only if the Dup DB replicator succeeded in obtaining a
lock on the account in the alternate system. In this way, data collisions were eliminated. In later

WellsFargo’sActive/ActiveATMNetwork
There was no abilityto switch ATMmachines individuallyfrom one network to another. However,
anentirenetwork couldbe switchedfrom itshomedatacentertothealternatedatacentershould
there be a data-center failure. This was called the “Big One” option - after all, the data centers

The Active/Active Architecture
The original active/active ATM architecture reflected the technology of the late 1980s. In each
datacenterwereapairofTandemVLXsystemsconnectedviaaFOXring.
The replication network connecting the two systems comprised six 56-KB Expand lines (Expand
is the proprietary protocol used by Tandem, now HP NonStop, to interconnect systems). The
ATMswereconnectedtotheirrespectivedatacentersvia9600-baudmodems.
By focusing on location availability through the use of dual systems kept synchronized by data
replication, ATM availability from the customer’s viewpoint was significantly increased.
Furthermore, with the capability to switch networks from a downed data center to an operating
datacenter,efficientandeffectivedisasterrecoverywasachieved.
Summary
This solution is reminiscent of the bank’s survival of the disastrous 1906 San Francisco
earthquake. Bank president I. W. Hellman telegraphed, “Building Destroyed, Vault Intact, Credit
Unaffected.”
Wells Fargo’s active/active ATM system lets it continue in this tradition. Let’s hope that sometime
in the future, Wells Fargo does not have to email the message, “Building Destroyed, Network
Intact,ATMsUnaffected.”
