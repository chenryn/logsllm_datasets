Attunity Integration Suite
December2010
Though not focused primarily on high availability in the uptime sense, the Attunity Integration
Suite (www.attunity.com) provides extensive functionality necessary to ensure the availability of
disparatedatasourcesandapplicationservicestotheenterpriseasawhole.
In today’s corporate environments, many of the critical applications and much of the corporate
data is still contained in legacy systems. The Butler Group estimates that 80% of all corporate
data is held in nonrelational databases. IDC estimates that 40% of all application development
effortsarestillfocusedonexpandingexistinglegacydata.1
Large and mid-sized firms alike have millions of lines of code executing on proprietary platforms.
These systems process a large proportion of the transactions that are the lifeblood of the
company. However, as today’s competitive situation becomes more intensive and morecomplex,
it is mandatory that these silo data sources and applications be able to interoperate with each
other.
ThisisthegoaloftheAttunityIntegrationSuite.

An Attunity Connect Agent imports the schema for its data source and stores it in its Data
Dictionary. For nonrelational data sources, it creates a relational model and schema that can be
usedforSQLoperations.
A SQL Query Processor optimizes SQL queries and ensures against “bad queries” that can be
detrimental to performance. XML Data Services provide an XML interface for Web services and
ServiceOrientedArchitecture(SOA)access.
Via the Connect Agents, clients can read and write data via SQL operations, execute SQL
queries, execute transactions, and participate in two-phase distributed transactions. Attunity
Connect provides several thin client agents that enable universal connectivity by providing a
varietyofinterfacestothedatasources:
 TheODBCDriverprovides32-bitand64-bitconnectivityusingANSISQL-92.
 TheJDBCDrivermakesdatasourcesaccessiblebyanyJavaorJ2EEapplication.
 TheOLEDBProviderprovidesdataaccessforWindowsapplications.
 The ADO.NET Provider makes data sources accessible by applications written in Visual
Basic,ASP.NET,andC#.
 TheXMLDataServicesAdapterdefinesXMLoperationsonthedatasourceinsupportof

 The SDK Driver allows developers to develop custom agents for proprietary data
structures.
ApplicationConnectivity
Attunity Connect application adapters provide integration with legacy applications running on
platforms ranging from Windows to mainframes. The adapters expose existing applications as
servicesthatcanbeusedbyJava,.NET,andwebapplications.
Attunity Connect supports many application-integration platforms such as Oracle SOA Suite and
Microsoft BizTalk. Local and global transaction interfaces are supported via the
XAinterface.
The Attunity adapters provide an XML interface to many application environments and queues.
Metadata is imported from the application, and additional metadata can be defined for multiple
interactions.Theinterfacescanbeusedbyapplicationsrunninginanycomputingenvironment.
Adapters are provided for CICS and CICS Queue, IMS/TM, COBOL, RPG, Tuxedo and Tuxedo
Queue, and Pathway applications. For those environments in which queues are supported,

Attunity Stream
Attunity Stream moves database changes from one database to another. Typical uses are to
build integrated data stores such as data warehouses and operational data stores, to feed such
platforms as ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load), EAI (Enterprise Application Integration), and BI
(Business Intelligence), or to keep different systems synchronized.2 In addition, the target
database can be used for reporting, for writing backups, or for batch processing, thus eliminating
batchwindows.
StreamisbasedonAttunity’sChangeDataCapture(CDC)technology.3
ChangeDataCapture
Change Data Capture captures changes made to enterprise data sources and makes these
changes available for immediate or later processing by other facilities. It does so non-intrusively
to the application updating the database – no changes need to be made to the application or the
database.
Attunity provides CDC capabilities for many databases, both relational and nonrelational. For
databases that maintain a log of changes, CDC follows the log, reading changes as they are
enteredintothechangelog.All SQLdatabases andsomenonrelationaldatabasesmaintainsuch
logs.TheyincludeOracleRedoLogs,DB2Journals,NonStopSQL/MPandEnscribeAuditTrails,
CICSlogsforVSAMfiles,SQLServerTransactionLogs,andAdabaspLogs.
Special techniques are required for nonrelational databases that do not provide accessible logs.
Forinstance,AttunityprovidesitsownloggersforVSAMfilesthatareupdatedbybatchprograms
and for IMS/DB files. RMS updates are intercepted by a special logger that interacts with
OpenVMSsystemservices.
The CDC capture facility provides the change stream to some other facility that will process it. In
thecase of AttunityStream,this facilityis the CDC Router.Other users of CDC areETL(Extract,

Transform, and Load), EAI (Enterprise Application Integration), and BI (Business Intelligence)
utilities.
CDC also can be used to capture and distribute events. With Event Data Capture (EDC), an
entire transaction representing the event is packaged as an XML message including all relevant
changes, even across several tables. Events are pushed via APIs such as JMS to event-driven
applications.
StreamProcessing
In Attunity Stream, changes are sent to the CDC Router in the Staging Area. The Staging Area
provides a place to store changed data and to applyintelligent filters and services. It offloads the
data servers and makes it easier to support multiple consumers of the streamed data changes.
The Staging Area is typically resident on the same server as the tool being driven by Stream
(ETL,EAI,BI,etc.)oronadedicatedserver.
The CDC Router is the heavy lifter in Stream. It stores changes in Change Tables for use by
different applications. Prior to storing data changes, it appends certain metadata information to
each change, including the type of change (insert/updated/delete), the time of the change, and
theapplicationthatmadethechange.
In addition, the CDC Router can be configured to apply certain processing rules to cleanse and
transform the data. Changes can be filtered based on tables, the type of change, and the
contentsofcertainfields.
From theChangeTables,applicationscanpollforchanges(pull)usingSQL(typicallyforETL);or
changes can be sent to the application (push) either immediately or according to a schedule via
XML (typically for EAI). Pushing changes and events is done via a Publisher. For instance, the
JMSPublisherpublisheseventstoJMSqueues,TIBCOqueues,andMQServerqueues.
Attunity Stream supports several interfaces. For SQL, access may be accomplished via ODBC,
JDBC, OLE DB, ADO, and ADO.NET clients. For XML, Stream supports .NET, JCA and 3GL
clients.

Attunity Stream is fault-resilient. It maintains a pointer in the change stream to the last change
that was successfully processed by each application. Stream positions are persistent. In the
event of a failure, Stream can pick up and continue processing from the last change that was
processed. In addition, change consumers can reposition in the change stream to facilitate
recovery,
Attunity Studio
The Attunity Studio is a GUI-based facility for configuring and managing the components of the
Attunity Integration Suite. Using an intuitive GUI interface, the Studio allows the developer to
import existing metadata, define new metadata, configure agents and adapters, configure the
CDC Router processing rules, deploy the Attunity components, and manage the production
environment. It provides single-console access to the entire Attunity network throughout the
enterprise.
