VMware’s Cloud Foundry Flounders
July2011
VMware (www.vmware.com) is the new kid on the block when it comes to cloud computing. Its
offering, the Cloud Foundry, is aptlynamed since it is not simplyanother cloud service. Rather, it
is intended to provide a platform for developers to build their own clouds. VMware’s intent is that
theCloudFoundrywillbecomethe“LinuxKernelofCloudOperatingSystems.”
VMware launched the Cloud Foundry on April 12, 2011. It did so by offering free access to its
own beta version of a PaaS (Platform as a Service) cloud for developers to experiment with their
ownclouds.
Unfortunately, just two weeks after its launch, the Cloud Foundry suffered a sequence of major
problems that took it down for about twelve hours over a day and a half period. Coincidently, this
was just five days after Amazon suffered a devastating crash that took down its EC2 (Elastic
Compute Cloud) cloud for four days and resulted in some irretrievable data loss.1 Interestingly,
both outages entailed a storage subsystem fault that was subsequently aggravated by a human
fatfinger.
Before we get into what happened to VMware’s Cloud Foundry, let’s look at what the Cloud
Foundryis.
The Cloud Foundry
The Cloud Foundry is free, open-source cloud-computing software developed by VMware. It can
support multiple frameworks, multiple cloud providers, and multiple application services, all on a
cloud-scaleplatform.
CloudFoundryOfferings
TheCloudFoundryisofferedinthreedifferentforms:
 CloudFoundry.com is a complete, multitenant PaaS (Platform as a Service)
environment hosted and managed by VMware. It runs on VMware’s vSphere cloud
platform and is written in Ruby. Currently, CloudFoundry.com supports Spring for Java
apps, Rails and Sinatra for Ruby apps, Node.js apps, and apps for other JVM
frameworks,includingGrails.

CloudFoundry.comis in beta and can be accessed for free. Users of the beta service will
be notified regarding the end of the beta phase. The pricing for commercial service has
notyetbeenannounced.
 CloudFoundry.orgis an open-source project where developers and community
members collaborate and contribute to the project. It is released as free software under
thetermsoftheApacheLicense2.0.
 Cloud Foundry Micro Cloud is a single developer instance of Cloud Foundry. It
provides developers with a personal PaaS that runs on their desktops. Micro Cloud is
provided as a downloadable software image for VMware Fusion or VMware Player as
well as a hosted image on selected cloud partners. Yet to be released, Micro Cloud will
beafreedownloadfor developers interested inasingleinstance,personal PaaS ontheir
localmachines.
CloudFoundryArchitecture
The Cloud Foundry platform consists of six major components – Droplet Execution Agents
(DEAs), a Cloud Controller, a Health Manager, Routers, services, and a message bus.
VirtualizationservicesareprovidedbytheunderlyingVMwarevSpherecloudplatform.
DropletExecutionAgent
The Droplet Execution Agent, as
its name implies, executes
droplets. A droplet contains all of
the objects that comprise an
application. These objects are
organized into a tar2 file and are
wrapped with a pair of start/stop
scripts. The droplet also has one
input that is used by the DEA to
assign a port number over which
the application can receive
requests.
There can be several server
nodes in a Cloud Foundry
environment.ADEAruns oneach
node and is responsible for
runningtheapplicationsassignedtoitsnode.
When a new application is ready to be deployed, the DEAs receive a broadcast message from
theCloud Controller (CC - described next) announcingtheavailabilityof theapplication. If aDEA
has theresources toexecutethe application, itresponds affirmatively.If it is chosenbytheCC, it
willreceivetheapplication’sdropletfromtheCC.
Onceitreceivesadroplet,theDEAcallsthedroplet’sstartscripttostarttheapplication.TheDEA
uses the droplet’s input to inform the application on which port number to listen for requests. The
application then broadcasts its location over the message bus so that the Routers know of its
existence.

CloudController
TheCloudController(CC)isthedeveloper’sinterfacetotheCloudFoundry.Whenadeveloperis
ready to deploy an application, he submits a directory tree of his application files to the CC. The
CCcheckstoseewhatfilesitalreadyhasandreturns alistofthefilesthatitneedsinordertobe
abletobuildtheapplication.
Once it has all of the components it needs, the CC creates a droplet for the application. Once it
has packaged the application into a droplet, it broadcasts on the message bus that it has an
application to run. Based on the responses received from the DEAs, it will assign the application
tooneormoreDEAsforexecutionbysendingthemthedroplet.
Routers
A Cloud Foundry platform has a pool of identical Routers. The Routers receive application
requestsfromexternalentitiesandroutethemtotheaddressedapplications.
The Routers listen to DEA broadcasts to know which applications are coming online and which
are going offline. When an application request is received by the Cloud Foundry, it is routed to
one of the Routers via a load balancer. The Router determines the application to which the
requestistoberoutedbasedontherequest’sheaderandsendstherequesttothatapplication.If
therearemultipleinstancesoftheapplication,theRouterwillchoseoneandwillsendtherequest
toit.
HealthManager
The Health Manager is a stand-alone daemon responsible for the reliable operation of the Cloud
Foundry. It periodically scans the CC’s database to see what the state of the cloud should be. It
theninspectstherealstatetoseeifthatstatematchestheexpectedstate.
If there is a discrepancy, the Health Manager will notify the CC. If the discrepancy is a downed
application, the CC will spawn a new instance of the application. If a DEA node is down, the CC
willredistributetheapplicationsthathadbeenrunningonthatnodetosurvivingDEAs.
Services
A set of services is provided for the applications to use. Included are messaging, caching, and
database (MySQL) services, among others. It is VMware’s intention that the set of services
ultimatelybecomesahugeecosystemprovidedbyVMwareandtheopencommunity.
MessageBus
The message bus provides a decoupled mechanism for all of the Cloud Foundry components to
communicatewitheachother.

Accordingtoadetailedaccount3postedonApril29thbyDekelTankel,oneoftheprimarybuilders
andmanagersofCloudFoundry,thefollowingsequenceofeventsoccurred:
 5:45amPDT,April25th
The Health Manager detected intermittent failures in two DEA nodes. It reported these
failures to the Cloud Controller, which took appropriate action to correct the problems.
Over the next thirty minutes, the failures intensified and spread to other DEA nodes. The
volumeoffailuresstartedtoimpacttheperformanceoftheCloudController.
 6:11amPDT,April25th
TheHealthManagersuddenlyissuedalargenumberofalerts.AlleightCloudControllers
had lost their connections to a portion of the storage subsystem. This caused the
controllersandtheHealthManagertoenterread-onlymode.
As a result, all developer control operations became inoperative. These functions
included logon, logoff, create application, start application, stop application, and others.
However,existingapplicationscontinuedtorunnormally.
 3:30pmPDT,April25th
The problems were corrected, and the developers could once again log in and continue
their development. They had been locked out of the Cloud Foundry for more than nine
hours.
 Therootcauseofthefailure
Itwassubsequentlydeterminedthattheproblemsstartedwithapartialoutageofapower
supply in one of the storage cabinets. This impacted a single LUN (logical unit number –
adiskorsetofdisks)andmadeitinaccessible.
Such a failure was expected to happen, and the platform had been designed to recover
from it by using redundant hardware and software. However, the monitoring system, the
recovery software, and the operational procedures were not consistent with each other.
Consequently,thefaultwasnotproperlyhandled,causingtheCloudControllertodeclare
alossofconnectivitywithasectionofstorage.
It took several hours to verify that there was no loss of data and that the storage
subsystemwasoperatingproperlybeforeservicetothedeveloperswasrestored.
 8amPDT,April26th
To prevent this situation from happening again in the future, it was decided to develop a
full operational playbook to properly guide Cloud Foundry operating staff in the early
detection, prevention, and restoration of services should the platform fail to properly
handleanylossofconnectivitytostorage.
Explicit instructions were issued not to make anykeyboard entries until the playbook had
been formally reviewed by the engineering and operations team in a meeting scheduled
for noon. This was to be a hands-off the keyboards, paper-only exercise until the
playbookreviewwascomplete.

 10:15amPDT,April26th
Unfortunately, one of the operations engineers “touched” a keyboard.4 This resulted in a
full outage of the network structure that front-ends the Cloud Foundry. It took out all the
load balancers, the routers, the firewalls, and other network components as well as a
portion of the DNS infrastructure. There was a complete loss of external connectivity to
thecloudplatform.
All of the applications in the DEA nodes continued to run, but it was only the operations
staffthatknewthis.Noonecouldaccessthemfromtheoutside.
 11:30amPDT,April26th
The operations staff successfully restored the network. The Cloud Foundry was once
againupandrunning.
DekelTankelendedhisanalysisbysaying:
“We take full responsibility for these issues and apologize to our users who were
impacted by them. We can and will do better, having already learned from these
incidents. We greatly appreciate your patience as we improve our service and the
underlying technology, while building capacity to deal with the extraordinary level of
demandthatweareexperiencing.….”

Lessons Learned
VMware’s outage did not have the same negative effects on its users as did the Amazon outage
a week earlier. The Cloud Foundry is a beta release that is expected to have problems – that is
why we have beta releases. Users have free access to it and are penalized only by their
inconvenience. This outage was simply a case of infant mortality. Nevertheless, it is important to
learnfromthisexperience.
Despite the rather full disclosure made by VMware following this series of outages, there are
severalcuriousquestionsstillremaining.
 How could a power-supply failure affect a portion of a storage subsystem? Were there
notredundantpowersupplies?
 Whydid the lack of access to a LUN in the storage unit take down the Cloud Controller?
Wherewasthebackupdatabasecopy?
 What possible sort of keyboard action could have wiped out the entire network feeding
thecloud?
Clearly, VMware has a lot to learn about managing a cloud before it goes prime time. However,
experiences like this are the best teacher. One of the key lessons that VMware must have
learned from this incident is that proper documentation, testing, and training is absolutely
necessarytoensurethatoperationalproceduresforanypurposeareadequate.

One thing that VMware did that was admirable was its transparent description of the events that
led up to the outages and their root causes. This is often a failing of an organization, leading to a
great deal of frustration for its users. In fact, VMware seemed to beat the press. The press
accountsdescribingtheseincidentsdidn’tstartuntilaboutthefirstofMay,aweeklater.
One subtle lesson that cloud outages such as those experienced by Amazon and VMware teach
is that the more resources you tryto bring together, the more things there are that can go wrong.
