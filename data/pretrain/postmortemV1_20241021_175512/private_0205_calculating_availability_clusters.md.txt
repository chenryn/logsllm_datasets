Calculating Availability - Cluster Availability
May2007
In our companion article, Active/Active versus Clusters, we hinted at an availability
difference between active/active systems and clusters. Let us look at that difference inmore
detail.
Failures and Failovers
There are two predominant reasons for a redundant system such as a cluster or an
active/activesystemtobeunavailabletoitsusers:
 SystemFailure-Thesystemisdown.
 Server Failover - One server in the system is down and is failing over to a backup
system.
The analysis of the availability impact of these two failure modes is documented in great
detail in our previous articles.1We review this analysis briefly below and applyit to a cluster
andanequivalentactive/activesystem.
SystemFailure
Let us consider the single-spared case. That is, the cluster or the active/active system has a
singlesparenode.Ifonenodeshouldfail,thesystemsurvives.However,iftwonodesshouldfail,
thesystemisdown.

The probability that two specific nodes will be down at the same time is the probability that one
nodeisdownandtheprobabilitythatasecondnodeisdown.Thisisf2=(1–a)2.
The system will be down if any two nodes in the system fail. If there are n nodes in the system,
there are n(n-1)/2 ways that two nodes can fail. That is, one out of n nodes can first fail followed
by one of the (n-1) remaining nodes for a total of n(n-1) combinations of node failures. But this
has countedeachnode pair twice,i.e.,anode3failurefollowedbyanode2failureandanode2
failure followed by a node 3 failure. Thus, there are only n(n-1)/2 unique combinations of a dual
nodefailure.

ServerFailover
If a single node fails, the system survives, However, during the time that the applications (in the
case of a cluster) or the users (in the case of an active/active system) are being switched over,
usersarenotbeingserviced.Sofarastheyareconcerned,thesystemisunavailable.

When one node fails, service to the users will be down for a period of MTFO. Since this will
happen on an average every mtbf period of time, the proportion of time that the system is down
duringfailoverofaparticularnodeisMTFO/mtbf.
However, there are n nodes in the system, the failure of any one of which will cause a failover
outage.Therefore,theprobabilityofafailoveroutageforthesystem,F,is

Clusters
Let us apply these equations to a typical cluster to calculate its availability. We will consider a
two-node cluster comprising industry standard servers, each with an availability of three 9s and
an mtbf of 4,000 hours (about six months). Cluster failover time is five minutes, or 300 seconds

(bringinguptheapplications,recoveringthedatabase, connectingtothedatabase,andswitching
IPaddresses).Thus,
n =2
a =.999
MTFO =300seconds
mtbf =4,000hours
Fortheseparameters,Equations(1)through(4) yield

F .000042(42x10-6)
f
F .000043(43x10-6)
A .999957(4+9s)
Clearly, in this case, failover time is the major factor in system availability and yields an
availabilityhalfwaybetweenfour9sandfive9s.
Active/Active Systems
Let us make this same availability calculation for an active/active system, except that the failover
timeisthreeseconds(switchingoverusers):
n =2
a =.999
MTFO =3seconds
mtbf =4,000hours
But first, we must make an adjustment to Equation (2). Unlike a cluster, in which all users are
down duringfailover, in an active/activesystem onlytheusers atthefailednode aredownduring
failover.Thus,only1/nusersareaffected.Sincewecountdowntimebasedonusersandnotona

A .99999879(6-9s)
Thus,theavailabilityofanactive/activesystem,usingthesamesystemsastheclusteredsystem,
isalmostsix9s.
In this case, failover time for the active/active system is 1% of the cluster failover time. Though
failover time is the predominant availability component for the cluster, it is not very significant for
the active/active system. Because of the much shorter failover time and the fact that only a
portion of users suffer a failover outage when a node in an active/active system fails, the
active/active configuration enjoys an availability that is more than an order of magnitude greater
thanthatofacluster.

It is instructive to consider the availability of the same active/active system if a fault-tolerant
system such as HP’s NonStop server is used. These systems have proven availabilities of about
four 9s, about ten times that of an industrystandard server. If an industrystandard server has an
mtbf of 4,000 hours (about six months), a fault-tolerant server will have an mtbf of 40,000 hours
(aboutfiveyears).Theavailabilityparametersforourexamplethenbecome

In this case, failover times are much more significant in the active/active system. However, with

Summary
Though cluster and active/active architectures have a great deal in common, there is a
tremendous difference in the availability that they offer. An active/active system can be an order

In our example using industry standard servers, a cluster can achieve almost five 9s availability
(about five minutes of downtime a year on the average). An active/active system using the same
hardware can achieve almost six 9s availability (about 30 seconds of downtime per year on the
average). If fault-tolerant nodes are used, an active/active system can achieve over seven 9s of
availability(aboutthreesecondsofdowntimeper yearontheaverage).
