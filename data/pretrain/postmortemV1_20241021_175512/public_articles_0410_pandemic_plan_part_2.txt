 Prioritize processes (functions): Use the Impact Analysis to create a hierarchy of
business functions ordered from those that are mission-critical to those that can be
suspendedforaperiodoftime. Identifythecriticalemployeesforeach.
 Manage skill sets: Identify employees with specific skill sets or functional experience.
Form teams of employees whose members have similar skills and experience to be
backup teams to provide a pool of employees to move into situations where the number
ofpersonnelhasfallenbelowcriticallevels.
 Travel/relocation: Consider what travel is important to your business, and restrict non-
criticaltravel.Planonhowyouwillrelocateemployeesifnecessary.
 Backfilling: Hire and train temporary employees to provide a buffer of trained personnel
to fill gaps. These people can be obtained from temporary employment agencies,
contractors,orevenretiringorretiredemployees.
 Dispersal to other locations: Employees with similar skills can be dispersed to other
locationsorothershiftstominimizethechanceofcross-contagion.
Response
Develop strategies for dealing with the impact of the pandemic at both organizational and
operationallevels.
ProcessContingencies
For each critical function, what resources does it need? Can it be performed by home-based
workers or workers at other sites? Can functions be scaled back, temporarily postponed, or
eliminated?Howcantheybeexecutedwithminimumface-to-facecontact?
SupplyChainStrategies
Identify what can be done in advance to plan for disruption in the supply chain. Create sourcing
diversityandstockpilemission-criticalcomponents.
 Sourcing diversity: Establish relationships with backup suppliers for those vendors who
aremission-criticalandwhoaresinglepointsoffailure.
 Stockpiling: Mission-critical supplies should be accumulated in the event that a supplier
cannot meet its delivery obligations. Consider the cost of stockpiling versus the risk of
componentshortages.
 Geographic dispersion: Consider geographic diversification of your vendor supplybase

 Pecking order check: Determine where you are in your vendors’ pecking order list.
Some vendor contracts with government and large customers may give them priority in
time of need. In critical cases, consider negotiating preferred treatment for critical
supplies.
 Supplier readiness: Do your critical vendors have pandemic plans of their own? What
do they entail? Have they identified their critical suppliers? How will they handle a
diminishedworkforceandrestrictedtransportation?Howwilltheycommunicatewithyou?
 Transportation readiness: How will you get products to your customers? What if there
are transportation restrictions? Set up alternative accounts with other delivery services
andtransportmodes.

 Options: Reduce travel time to reduce exposure. Employees who have already
recovered from the virus may be the best bet for travel you cannot eliminate. Change
your sales and service operations to reduce direct contact with customers. Consider
videoconferencing. Take advantage of the needs of potential customers to expand your
marketbybeinganalternatesuppliertothem.
 Honesty and information: Don’t hide the truth. The pandemic will pass, but the
customerswhohavebeenliedtowillremember.
 Alternate distribution: Increase online opportunities for customers to order your goods.

 Making hard choices: What if you cannot meet customer demands or sales are
insufficient to support the business? Can you so “no” to customers? Can you scale back
productionandreduceyourworkforce?
PhysicalSecurity
Physical security entails securing access to buildings to minimize infections. It also requires
keeping parking areas, communication networks, the supply chain, and transportation modes
secureinthefaceofpandemicproblems.
 Secure buildings: Employ guards and limited access to restrict access to employees,
visitors, vendors, and suppliers suspected of being infected. Have written policies in
placedescribinghowsuchpeoplearetobeidentified.
 Secure parking: If a significant number of your employees use mass-transit, where will
they park if the mass transit system closes down? What if the operators of a parking
garage have to close the garage? If other parking garages close down, how do you
preventnon-employeesfromfillingupyourparkingarea?
 Secure supply chain: Commodities that are normally common may gain considerable
value during a pandemic. Ensure your delivery and storage are safe and reliable. For

 Secure communication channels: Make sure that critical voice and data
communication channels are not subject to disruption. This includes land lines, virtual
private networks (VPNs), Voice over IP (VoIP), cellular communication, facsimile, web
communications,andyourownPBX.Establishbackupcommunicationchannels.
