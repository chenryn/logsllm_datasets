American Airlines Grounded by iPad Glitch
May2015
In 2012, American Airlines replaced the 35 pounds of paper navigation charts carried by
itspilotswithiPadsthatdisplayedchartsuponrequest.Itwasthefirstairlinetodoso.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, April 28 and April 29, 2015, dozens of American Airlines flights were
grounded or seriouslydelayed because the pilots were not able to access their navigation charts on their
iPads. The problem turned out to be an error in the chart app supplied by Jeppesen, a Boeing company

Though unrelated, this incident has increased the concern of the possibility of hacking into an airliner’s

The Conversion from Paper Charts to iPads
Until recently, pilots used paper charts for departure, enroute, and
approach navigation as well as for finding their way around airport
taxiways. A typical flight bag carried on board by a pilot might include
3,000 pages of charts weighing 35 pounds. The pilot must have not only
the charts for his intended route, but he also must have all the charts
necessaryforanydiversionofhisflightduetoanemergency.
Recently, Jeppesen introduced electronic charts and an app that allowed the charts to be downloaded to
aniPad.Thishadthepotentialofreducing35pounds ofpapercharts withalight-weightiPad.Inaddition,
charts could be accessed with a couple of clicks rather than having to search through a flight bag loaded
with manuals. Furthermore, the iPad charts could be updated daily with a few minutes of download time

iPads rapidly became popular for reference, but they initially were not approved by the FAA (the U.S.
FederalAviationAdministration)asareplacementfortraditionalpapercharts.
Driven by the obvious advantages of replacing paper charts with iPads, the FAA tested them thoroughly,
including subjecting iPads to rapid decompression and ensuring that
they would not interfere with critical navigation or electronic equipment.
They also concerned themselves with what would happen if an app
crashed, but found that the problem could be corrected in seconds with
asimplereboot.
The FAA then tried out the use of iPads in a small regional carrier for a
couple of years. This test was successful, and in 2012 the FAA
approvedtheuseofiPadchartsasareplacementforpapercharts.

American Airlines was the first major commercial carrier to deploy electronic flight bags throughout its
fleet and to discontinue paper charts. It replaced 8,000 flight bags weighing 35 pounds with 8,000 iPads.
The airline estimated that the switch to iPads saved 400,000 gallons fuel annually, providing an annual
savingofUSD$1.2millionatthecurrentfuelprices
American’siPadGlitch
At about 7 PM Pacific Time Tuesday, April 28, 2015, some American Airline pilots found that their iPads
crashed when they tried to bring up navigation charts. The problem only occurred if the iPads were
running Apple’s newest operating system, iOS 8.3. Was it an Apple problem or a Jeppesen problem?

Manypilots discovered the glitch only after theyhad taxied to the runwayand were setting up for takeoff,
a procedure which included bringing up their departure and enroute plates. They had to taxi back to the
gate and await a correction. American Airlines said that 24 flights were delayed in this way on Tuesday
and50delaysoccurredonWednesday.Somedelayslastedforseveralhours.
Some pilots solved the problem by getting paper charts that were available at the airport. Others found
that using a Wi-Fi connection at the gate to reboot the app cured the problem. American Airlines
announcedthat“our pilots havebeenabletoaddress theissuebydownloadingtheappagainatthegate

Jeppesen’sResponse
Jeppesen issued a worldwide NavData notice on April 28 that indicated that the problem was caused by
Apple’snewoperatingsystemandthatJeppesenwaswaitingforafixfromApple:
TheProblemIsFound
Unfortunately for Jeppesen, American Airlines found the problem the next day onWednesday, April 29th.
The issue was, in fact, caused by a Jeppesen error. A duplicate chart for Reagan National Airport had
been included in American Airlines’ chart database. The Jeppesen app could not reconcile the duplicate
chart,causingittoshutdown.

The problem was cured by uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Until the Jeppesen chart database was

Potential of Hacking Airline Avionics
Though not directly related, the GAO (U.S. Government Accountability Office) had issued a report just a
week earlier warning that “unsecured connections between the passenger Wi-Fi networks and the
avionics systems on some Boeing and Airbus planes could make it possible for a hacker to gain access
to navigational controls and commandeer the plane.” The GAO noted that onboard firewalls intended to
protect avionics from hackers could be breached if flight control and entertainment systems used the
samewiringandrouters.
The report was in response to a pair of security experts’ admission that they had connected to the

TheFAAhas concurred withthis concernandis working withtheU.S.NationalSecurityAgency(NSA) to
identify needed changes. These organizations have issued an alert that describes the signs that flight

Our Personal Experience
Both my wife and I are general aviation pilots. In fact, Janice is a flight instructor. We use flight charts on
our iPads. Rather than the Jeppesen charts (which are quite expensive), we instead use charts from
ForeFlight. They are wonderful moving map displays, showing our position via GPS on departure,
enroute,approach,andtaxiwaycharts.TheyprovidebothVFRcharts(VisualFlightRuleschartsforgood
weather)andIFRcharts(InstrumentFlightRuleschartsforbadweather).
However,our experiencehas ledus totheconclusion toalways havepaper charts withus (yes, our flight
bag is pretty heavy). One challenge is glare. Light coming into our cockpit often makes the screens
unreadable unless we block the light with our hands. Even glare shields don’t help. Flying a complex
instrument approach into an airport is no time to have to lose the use of a hand or to have to continually
squintataglaredscreen.
Another surprising problem is that our iPads have a tendency to overheat with the sun beating on them
through the cockpit windows.When theydo, they shut down.Without paper charts as a backup, we then
wouldbewithoutnavigationalinformation.
In large airliners, the iPads can be positioned to avoid these problems. However, iPads without paper
backupmayneverbeusedsuccessfullyingeneralaviation.

Summary
The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly growing to integrate all of the devices in our lives. As American
Airlines’ experience has shown, this can lead to problems due to software errors introduced by humans.
The American Airline’s challenge was resolved with nothing more than a serious inconvenience to many
ofitspassengers,butitcouldhaveresultedinalife-threateningsituation.
Adding to the concern of software errors is the ability to hack systems. The GAO’s alert that airline flight
control systems could be taken over by hackers via the in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system exposes a
seriousthreatposedbyIoT.
