Google Will Help You Manage the 2016 Leap Second

Our dayis onerotationof theEarthaboutits axis.Wecallthis a‘solar day.’Webreak
up the solar day into 24 hours. Each hour contains 60 minutes, and each minute
contains60seconds.Thus,thereare86,400secondsinaday.

However, the Earth wobbles. The Earth’s rotation is affected by actions such as tides in the oceans and
the movement of magma beneath the Earth’s crust. These actions cause variations in the length of the
solarday,typicallyslowingitdownslightly.
Toaccountfor thevariation,onesecond is added onoccasiontoUTC timetosynchronize it withthetrue
solar day. This second is called a leap second. Leap seconds began in 1972 and are now administered
bytheInternationalEarthRotationandReferenceSystemsService(IERS).
However, leap seconds do not occur with regular frequency. They cannot be predicted because of
irregularitiesintheEarth’srotation.Inthepast40yearsorso,about25leapsecondshavebeenaddedto
our clocks. Nine leap seconds were added in the eight years from 1972 to 1979. However, no leap
seconds wereadded inthe seven years from 1999to 2005.Thelastleapsecond was addedonJune30,
2015.
Therehas never been a timewhen a leap second was subtracted from UTC.Theearth is indeed slowing
down.
Leap seconds generally are announced six months in advance to give everyone time to prepare. They
always occur at the end of June or the end of December. Adding an additional second can wreak havoc

Aleapsecond willbeaddedthis year justaftermidnightonDecember 31,2016.MostInternet-connected
devices get their time from NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers. NTP is an open-source technology
usedallovertheworld.
For this coming leap second, Google is here to help. Google runs its own NTP servers and uses them to
ease its systems through leapseconds.Rather than adding asecond atmidnight (leading to an improper
time of 23:59:60), Google uses a ‘smeared time’ technique. Its NTP servers run their clocks 0.0014

Enterprises running virtual-machine instances on Google’s Compute Engine and those using Google
APIs must keep their systems synchronized with Google’s slightly slower clocks during the twenty-hour
adjustmentperiod.ClientsystemsalsowillhavetouseGoogle’stimetoworkwithitsservers.
In addition to those working with Google’s services, Google is encouraging everyone to use its NTP
servers for free. Users can do this by configuring their network settings to use time.google.com as their
NTPserver.
Googleisn’ttheonlyoneto smear time.Amazonand Microsofthavedonethis in thepast.Infact,the big
cloud companies are planning to smear the second over a 24-hour period. Google plans to use this
longer time period for the next leap second to align itself with the other companies. Though there is no
