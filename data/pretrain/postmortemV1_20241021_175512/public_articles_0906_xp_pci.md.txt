Windows XP Is No Longer PCI DSS Compliant
June2014
Even though Microsoft’s Windows XP operating system is still running on 25% of the
world’s desktop computers and PCs, Microsoft elected to end XP support on April 8,
2014. According to the Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards organization, XP
systems no longer comply with the PCI Data Security Standard (DSS). Merchants still
using XP-based systems to process payment cards will no longer be able to pass the
PCIDSSmandatoryannualcomplianceaudit.
Requirement6.2ofthePCIDSSstates:
“Ensure that all systems and software are protected from known vulnerabilities by installing
application vendor-supplied security patches. Install critical security patches within one month of
release.”
Since Microsoft will no longer be providing security patches, Windows XP is, by definition, not compliant
and cannot be used in payment card applications. For Internet-facing applications, XP systems will be
automatically detected by ASV (Approved Scanning Vendors) scans. This will be reported as an
automaticfailureofthecomplianceaudit.
Windows XP – AHaven for Hackers
In an earlier article in the Availability Digest on the termination of XP support,1 we pointed out that
hackers would be hoarding vulnerabilities unknown to Microsoft (so-called zero-day exploits) and not
usingthem untilWindows XPsupportended.Theythenwouldhavefreereignto usethesevulnerabilities
to attack XP systems with no fear of the vulnerabilities being closed down by Microsoft security updates.
Inarecentsecurityblog,Microsoftpointedoutthatthesituationisfarworsethanthis:
“The very first month that Microsoft releases security updates for supported versions of Windows,
attackers will reverseengineer thoseupdates,find the vulnerabilities and testWindows XP tosee if it
shares those vulnerabilities. If it does, attackers will attempt to develop exploit code that can take
advantage of those vulnerabilities on Windows XP.Since a security update will never become
available for Windows XP to address these vulnerabilities, Windows XP will essentially have a “zero
day”vulnerabilityforever.

What Can Be Done?
UpgradetheWindowsXPSystems
The only proper way to handle this situation is to upgrade Windows XP systems to Windows 7 or
Windows 8 systems. Windows XP’s long life has given hackers plenty of time to work around its main
defense lines. Attacks have evolved and surpassed XP’s ability to defend against them. Security
mitigationsinWindows7andWindows8arefarmoresophisticated.
Unfortunately, upgradingWindows XP systems can be veryexpensive. Subsequent versions ofWindows

Giventhatacompanyis willingtobitetheupgradebullet,thefirststepistoidentifytheXPsystemsbeing
used by the company. Many organizations host all or a portion of their IT environment off-site, further

Organizations can use vulnerability scanning to help identify all instances of XP within their environment.
For instance, ControlScan is a cloud based utilitythat performs an internal vulnerabilityscan. It is a quick
andeasywaytodiscoverXPwithintheIT infrastructure.ControlScan’sscanningprocessisprovidedwith
a tunnel into the internal network. From there, an initial discovery scan is performed to identify all IP-
addressable systems in the environment. Next, each system is scanned in turn to identify relevant
attributes, services and processes. The report generated from the internal scanning process lists each IP
address discovered as well as the operating system and version. This gives a clear view of where XP
residesinthenetwork.
CompensatingControls
While the ideal plan is to upgrade all XP machines to a modern operating system, some organizations
simply can’t allocate the necessary financial or human resources to do this. However, it is extremely
importantthattheseorganizationshaveagameplan.
The Knowledge Base of the PCI Security Standards Council gives some guidance to a potential
temporary solution known as compensating controls. In its Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) 1130, it
raisesthequestion:
“Areoperatingsystemsthatarenolongersupportedbythevendornon-compliantwiththePCIDSS?”
FAQ1130states:
”PCI DSS Requirements 6.1 and 6.2 address the need to keep systems up to date with vendor-
supplied security patches in order to protect systems from known vulnerabilities. Where operating
systems are no longer supported by the vendor, OEM, or developer, security patches might not be
availabletoprotectthesystemsfromknownexploits,andtheserequirements wouldnotbeabletobe
met.
However, it may be possible to implement compensating controls to address risks posed by using
unsupported operating systems in order to meet the intent of the requirements. To be effective, the
compensating controls must protect the system from vulnerabilities that may lead to exploit of
unsupported code. … Examples of controls that may be combined to contribute to an overall
compensating control include active monitoring of system logs and network traffic, properly-
configured application whitelisting that permits only authenticated system files to execute, and

isolating the unsupported systems from other systems and networks. Note that these examples may
complement an overall compensating control, but these examples alone would not provide sufficient
mitigation.
An effective option to implement compensating controls is to enlist the services of a Managed Security
Service Provider (MSSP). MSSPs specialize in delivering the technical expertise and security know-how
required to meet PCI compliance requirements. They will partner with an organization to ensure that
firewall settings and system configurations are secure and systems are monitored 24/7/365 for any
suspiciousactivity.

Summary
Any payment systems still running the Windows XP operating system are now out of PCI DSS
compliance. Without the latest security protections, your XP systems are open to all kinds of malware
attacks, including stealing data. If you accept payment cards, you have something hackers want.
Processing payment cards with XP systems just makes it easier to the hackers to get at them. They

Should your organization experience a breach, you will be deemed “non-compliant,” even if you were
