Sophos Security Threat Report 2013
June2013
Every year, Sophos Ltd., a major securityfirm based in the U.K., publishes a threat report that highlights
the securitythreats of the past year and the threats that seem likelyin the coming year. In this article, we
summarizethefindingsoftheSophosSecurityThreatReport2013.1
IT security is evolving from a device-centric view to a user-centric view, bringing many new security
challenges. Users are fully embracing the power to access data from anywhere. The rapid adoption of
bring-your-own-devices(BYOD)isacceleratingthistrendandisprovidingnewmalwareattackvectors.
Another trend is the transformation of endpoint devices from homogeneous Windows systems to an
environment of diverse systems. Predominant among exploits of such devices is Android malware, a
seriousandgrowingthreat.
The web remains the dominant source for malware. Social engineering and targeting vulnerabilities in
browsersandapplicationsrepresenttheprimaryattackvectorslaunchedfromtheweb.
A modern security policy must focus on all areas of vulnerability – enforcement of BYOD use policies,
data encryption, secure access to corporate networks, content filtering, patch management, and threat
andmalwareprotection.
New Platforms and Changing Threats
In 2012, attackers continued to target thousands of badly configured websites and databases to expose
passwords and deliver malware. They are now extending their reach to social networks and cloud
platforms.
On the positive side, law enforcement authorities achieved significant victories against malware networks
and cybercriminals. Those that facilitate cybercrime via botnets and online toolkits can be held as liable
asthecybercriminalsthemselves.
SocialMedia
Throughout 2012, hundreds ofmillions of users flocked to social networks; and so did the cybercriminals.
Included in the attacks were Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest. For instance, Twitter direct messages
(DMs) from reportedly online friends claimed that a person had been captured on video that had been
posted on Facebook. Following the directions to see the video, that person was infected with a backdoor

With one billion users, Facebook remains the top target for attackers. Innovations such as Facebook
showing a person photos of his friends and asking that person to identify them – something that hackers
can’tdo–mayprovehelpful.
CloudServices
Cloud security drew attention in 2012 when Dropbox admitted that user names and passwords stolen
from other websites had been used to sign into some of its accounts. Evidently, Dropbox employees had
used the same user names and passwords for all of their accounts. When the attackers discovered that
thesecouldbeusedtoaccessDropboxaccounts,Dropboxsecuritywasbreached.
This followed a 2011 Dropbox security lapse when it accidentally removed all password protection from
its accounts for nearly four hours. Dropbox now provides optional two-factor authentication, in which a
secretpasswordsenttotheuseruponlogonmustbeenteredinordertoaccesstheaccount.

 Use application controls to block or allow access to particular applications, either for the entire
companyorforspecificgroups.
 Automaticallyencryptdatabeforeitisuploadedtothecloudfromanymanagedendpoint.
Blackhole: Today’s Malware Market Leader
Blackhole is now the world’s most notorious malware exploit kit. An exploit kit is a prepackaged software
toolthatcanbeusedtoinfectservers withundetectedmalware.Itsauthorsbenefitbydeliveringpayloads
forothers.Nearly30%ofthethreatsdetectedbySophoshavebeenBlackhole-related.
Blackhole is distributed using a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) rental model. Rental rates are specified (in
Russian)inthekit’saccompanyingread-mefile.
Blackholeworksinfourstages:
1. Hackers add malicious Java script to legitimate web sites that generate links to the hackers’
Blackhole site. When someone visits the legitimate site, their browsers pull down the exploit kit
fromtheBlackholesite.
2. The exploit code first determines the path through which the browser arrived at the Blackhole
server. This is used to pay the affiliates who generated the traffic in the first place. It then
determineswhichoperatingsystemthebrowserisusing.
3. At this point, Blackhole delivers the payload it’s been directed to send. It can actively check the

Java Attacks Reach Critical Mass
Major new vulnerabilities in Java encouraged many organizations to get rid of Java in their browsers.
Oracle quickly released emergency patches, but other vulnerabilities were rapidly found and attacked.
TheDepartmentof Homeland Securityhas releasedanalertrecommending that companies disable Java
intheirbrowsers.2

Android: Today’s Biggest Target
Androids represent more than a 50% share of the smartphone market. Targets this large are difficult for

RootedDevices
It is possible for Android users to “root” their devices so that they have administrative control over their
phones. This allows them, for instance, to remove unwanted software and add-ons included by the
serviceproviderandtoreplacethemwithalternativesoftheirchoice.
However, rooting bypasses the built-in Android securitymodel and invites malware to gain privileges and

Diverse Platforms and Technologies Widen Opportunities for Attack
It used to be that almost everyone ran Windows. Security focused on Windows. Those days are now
gone. Far more development currently takes place for the web and mobile platforms. Some examples of
2012securitybreachesinclude:
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) holes in online stores certified as safe by VeriSign, Visa, or
MasterCard allowed criminals to steal authentication credentials and customer billing information,
therebyputtingthecustomersatriskforidentitytheft.
 Users received “order verification” emails containing links to legitimateWordPress blogs that had
beeninfectedtodownloadmalware.
 Hackers have been demonstrating attacks against everything from transit-fare cards to near-field
communication-enabled(NFC)smartphones.
 Ransomware is a particularly vicious attack. The attacker locks the PC or encrypts its files and
demands that payment of a few hundred dollars be made via a cashier’s check or international
moneyorder.
OSX and the Mac: More Users, Emerging Risks
Most malware developers have found it to be more profitable to attack Windows and Android than the
smaller community of Apple devices. However, the presence of Apple Macs in the workplace is growing;
andtheyarebecomingamoreattractivetarget.
Attackersseem tobefollowingtheirWindowssuccessesinattackingMacPCs.Onewaytoanticipatethe

In 2012, Java vulnerabilities allowed many Macs to be infected. Apple has now by default disabled Java
initsoperatingsystems.
Morcut/Crisis
OSX/Morcut-A (aka Crisis) was discovered in 2012. It is designed for spying and monitors virtually every
way a user communicates. It is contained in a Java Archive file (JAR) digitally signed by VeriSign. If
installed by a user, Morcut runs without administrative authentication. It opens a Mac backdoor to accept
malwarethatstealsuserdata.
Morcut represents a serious threat to corporate security and compliance. It can initiate targeted attacks

Much of the malware found on Macs is Windows malware. Though this is often dismissed by Mac users
as not being a threat, this is only true if they are using OSX operating systems. However, if they are

Authorities Make High-Profile Malware Arrests and Takedowns
2012 saw a marked increase in the success of law enforcement authorities around the world in
apprehendingcybercriminals.

 Following their 2011 arrests of the notorious LulzSec hackers, U.S. authorities gained extensive
cooperation from one of its keymembers, Hector Xavier Monsegur (Sabu). He reportedly worked
months under cover, building cases against those behind hacking attacks on the CIA, Pentagon,
the U.S. Senate, and many other prominent organizations. He helped nab Jake Davis in the
ShetlandIslands,whereDavisreportedlyheld750,000stolenpasswords.
 U.S. authorities extradited Russian cybercriminal Vladimir Zdorovenin. He is charged with
installing key loggers to capture credit-card numbers, which were then used to purchase goods
fromonlinestores.
 The mastermind of Bredolab, Georgy Avanesov, was sentenced to four years in jail in Armenia.
Bredolab was a botnet that had captured 30 million computers. Avanesov reportedly made
100,000 euros a month renting his botnet to cybercriminals who wanted to spew email and
spreadmalware.
 The FBI arrested 24 cybercriminals from the U.S., U.K., Bosnia, Bulgaria, Norway, and Germany
forcredit-cardfraud.
 Tokyo police arrested six men in connection with an Android app that stole personal data and
thendemandedafeetonotdistributethedata.
 The U.K. obtained stiff sentences for three citizens of Baltic states after their convictions for
stealingfromonlinebankaccountsintheU.K.,theNetherlands,andNewZealand.
 Authorities took down the command and control computers of the huge Grum botnet that was
responsibleforanestimated17%oftheworld’sspam.
Growth of Dangerous Targeted Attacks
2012 saw an increase in state-sponsored attacks. The Flame attack infected systems around the world
for surveillancepurposes.3TheShamoonTrojancausedsignificantdamagethroughoutthe Middle East’s
energy sector. It infected some 30,000 computers and took Saudi Arabia’s national oil company and
Qatar’s natural gas firm offline. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks were directed against many
largeU.S.banks.4
By their very nature, state-sponsored cyberattacks are difficult to track and prove. More actors appear to
be developing the capabilities to launch such attacks. Whatever their source, these attacks have
breached some nation’s most advanced computer defenses and exposed the vulnerability of their
infrastructures.
Polymorphic and Targeted Attacks: The Long Tail
A polymorphic virus is able to mutate while keeping its original algorithm intact. The code changes each
time it runs, but the functions of the code do not change. This makes a virus very difficult to detect via
signatures(codesnippets).
The phrase “long tail” is often used in statistics to describe events that do not fall within the conventional
statistical distribution but rather occur in ones and twos at the “tail end.” Polymorphic malware changes
form for every infection. Sophos reports that 75% of the malware reported to it is seen in only one
organization.Thislevelofpolymorphismisunprecedented.

Polymorphic attacks were classically found in Windows systems. However, in 2012, it appeared for the
first time in Android malware. These attacks are often used to target specific classes of users, such as
financial decision makers. By limiting the scope of the attacks, the cybercriminal minimizes the spread of
hisvirusandminimizesitschanceofdetection.
