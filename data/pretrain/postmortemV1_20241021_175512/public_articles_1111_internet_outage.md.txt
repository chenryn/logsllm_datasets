U.S. Internet Traffic Comes to a Halt
November2016
In our article in last month’s issue of the Availability Digest, “Can a Country Shut
Down Its Internet,” we concluded that most developed countries could not do so –
certainlynot the United States nor the western European countries. Internet access is
provided by too many Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and all would have to be taken out of service.
The Internet has been taken down bythe governments of countries that have only one or two ISPs, such
asSyriaandLibya.
However, now we must backpedal a bit on that statement. The Internet was taken down over a large
swath of the United States in mid-October, 2016. How did that happen? The short answer is a massive
DDoSattackonamajorDNSprovider.
The Internet Outage
At 7:10 am Eastern Time on October 21, 2016, users around the world started to have problems
accessing some of the most popular sites on the web. The sites included Netflix, Twitter, Spotify, Reddit,
CNN,PayPal,Pinterest,FoxNews,Amazon,Github,andAirbnb.Manynewspapersalsowereincludedin
theoutage,includingtheGuardian,theNewYorkTimes,andtheWallStreetJournal.
The web sites that were inaccessible seemed to be concentrated in the United States in the Northeast,
Texas,LosAngeles,SanFrancisco,andSeattle.SomewebsitesinEuropewerealsoaffected.

Themorning outage lasted abouttwohours.It was determinedthat theoutage was causedbyamassive
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack on Dyn, a major Domain Name System (DNS) company
locatedinNewHampshire,U.S.A.TheoutagewasresolvedbyDynaround9:30am.

A second attack occurred just before noon. A third attack was launched against Dyn a little after 4 pm.

How Did It Happen?
As a DNS provider, Dyn resolves URLs entered by users into IP addresses so that the web sites being
referenced by the URLs can be accessed via the Internet. When Dyn was hit by the massive DDoS
attack,normalURLrequestscouldnotreachDynandcouldnotberesolved.
Dyn provides DNS services to many predominant web sites, including those listed above as being
unreachable. This is why these web sites could not be reached during the Dyn attacks. DNS registrars
suchasDyntypicallyprovideDNSservicesforthousandsortensofthousandsofdomainnames.
AccordingtoDyn,theDDoSattackswerecomingfromtensofmillionsofIPaddressesatthesametime.

AttackingaDNSserver is averyeffective waytotakedownmultiple websites (perhaps thousands inthe
caseof Dyn).Rather thantargeting individual websites,aDNSserver attack takes outtheentire Internet
for any web sites served by the DNS server and for any end users whose URL resolution requests route
through that server. The volume of malicious DDoS requests directed toward the DNS server is amplified
byautomaticre-requestswhenIPresolutions arenotreceivedandbywell-meaningusershitting“refresh”
overandover.
The IoT Conundrum
The DDoS attack launched against Dyn used the Mirai virus. The Mirai malware is a very sophisticated
virus. It is self-propagating malware that builds a botnet of devices by scouring the Internet for IoT
devices that are protected by little more than factory-default usernames and passwords. The botnet can

Any device connected to the Internet is a candidate for a Mirai infection – DVRs, cable set-top boxes,
routers,evenInternet-connectedcamerasusedbystoresandbusinessesforsurveillance.
Mirai malware is estimated to have infected over 500,000 devices so far. About 10% of these devices
participatedinFriday’sattackagainsttheInternet.Apparently,otherbotnetsalsowereinvolved.
Interestingly, the Internet attack was launched the day after Dyn’s principal data analyst wrote a blog
aboutthesetypesofIoT-basedattacksentitled“WhatIsTheImpactOnManagedDNSOperators?”
The developer of Mirai released the source code for the Mirai malware on September 30, 2016. The
source code was posted on dark web sites that operate as sort of an online underground for the hacker
community.
The Mirai source code now available to hackers allows any hacker to build his own IoT attack army. This
virtuallyguaranteesthattheInternetwillsoonbefloodedwithattacksfrommanynewbotnetspoweredby
insecurerouters,IPcameras,digitalvideorecorders,andothereasilyhackabledevices.
Summary
The Mirai Internet attack has drawn the attention of the FBI, which is investigating all potential causes of
the attack. However, until IoT device manufacturers incorporate powerful security features into their
software to deter malware infections, such attacks are likely to continue. There is no indication that IoT
devicemanufacturersaregoingtofollowthisroute.
