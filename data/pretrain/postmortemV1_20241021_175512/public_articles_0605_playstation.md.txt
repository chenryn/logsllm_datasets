Sony PlayStation Taken Down for Weeks by Hackers
May2011
This may be the biggest hacking story in history – at least so far. In mid-April, 2011, hackers
gained access to Sony’s online gaming servers and stole sensitive personal information for over
100millionaccounts.Itis estimatedthatthisbreachcouldcostSonyandcredit/debitcardissuers
upto$2billionU.S.inrecoveryexpenses,nottomentionthecostofpendinglawsuits.
As soon as Sony discovered the breach, it closed down its online gaming services until it could
restructure its security defenses. This happened on Wednesday, April 20th. At the time, Sony
indicated that its services might be down for a few days. As of this writing, gaming services have
beendownforthreeweeksandcounting.Sonyhasstoppedpredictingwhenits onlinegameswill
resume.
Though Sony is teaming with the FBI (the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation) and private
investigators, the perpetrators have yet to be identified. However, there is evidence that points to
ahacking group that wantedto get revengefor Sony’s “unfair legal actions” againsta well-known
hackerwhohadmanagedtofindandpublishthesecretkeystoSony’sonlinegames.
Sony’s Online Gaming Services
Several Sony entities were involved in this incident. Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) is Sony’s
game development and publishing division. Its games are MMORPG games – massive
multiplayer online role-playing games – in which millions of subscribers compete with each other
formastery.
PlayStation 3 is the latest version of Sony’s very
popular home video game console. It is used to play
both offline and online games and competes with
Microsoft’sXboxandNintendo’sWii.
The PlayStation Network (PSN) is Sony’s online
network for supporting multiplayer games using the
PlayStation3.
Qriocity (pronounced curiosity) is Sony’s on-demand
streaming services for videos, music, games, and

The Intrusion
From April 16 through April 18, 2011, unbeknownst to Sony, hackers gained access to Sony’s
gaming servers for the PlayStation Network, Qriocity, and SOE. Sony personnel did not detect
the intrusion into the PSN and Qriocity servers until the following day, April 19th. On April 20th,
they shut down the PSN and Qriocity services, explaining that the servers were down for
maintenance. All online gaming using the PlayStation 3 console was dead, though offline games
couldstillbeplayed.AllQriocitystreamingserviceswereterminated.
It was not until April 23rd that Sony publicly disclosed the breach of PSN and Qriocity. It
acknowledged that 77 million accounts were vulnerable but said that it did not think any critical
personal data had been compromised. Later, Sony revealed that names, addresses, email
addresses, birthdates, and login information might have been compromised. However, it had no
indicationthatcredit-ordebit-cardnumbershadbeenstolen,thoughthiscouldnotberuledout.
OnApril25th, Sonyannouncedthat the enhancements itneededtobeef upits securityprotection
services would be time-consuming. On May 1st, it predicted that some services would be back
onlineduringthefirstweekinMay.
Then on May 1st, the magnitude of the disaster was discovered to be worse than originally
thought. The investigating team found that the mid-April attacks had also similarly compromised
the 25 million subscriber accounts for SOE. The company shut down the Sony Online
Entertainment services the next day and ceased making predictions as to when services would
be restored. As of this writing, May 8th, no further word has been forthcoming as to when online
gamingserviceswillberestored.
Even Congress Gets Involved
Shortly after Sony announced that credit- and debit-card information may have been stolen, the
U.S. House of Representatives’ Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade sent
Sony a letter demanding answers to several questions. On its May 4th PlayStation blog, Sony
summarizeditsresponsestotheCongressionalinquiry:

Sony’s Customer Care Response
On May 5th, Harold Stringer, CEO of Sony, reiterated that credit-card numbers did not appear to
havebeencompromised:
” To date, there is no confirmed evidence any credit card or personal information has been
misused; and we continue to monitor the situation closely. We are also moving ahead with
plans to help protect our customers from identity theft around the world. A program for U.S.
PlayStation Network and Qriocitycustomers that includes a $1 million identitytheft insurance
policy per user was launched earlier today, and announcements for other regions will be
comingsoon.”
Theidentity-theftinsurancethatMr.Stringerreferredtois AllClearIDPlusfrom Debix.Itprovides
monitoring of credit-card usage, notification of suspicious activity, and the assignment of an
investigator to help resolve credit issues. It provides $1 million of identity-theft insurance for
covered expenses. Sony will provide the service free to all U.S. customers for the first year. It is
lookingintoprovidingsimilarprotectiontoitsotherinternationalcustomers.
In addition, Sony is offering thirty days of free service plus one additional day for every day that
thegamingservicesaredown.
The Potential Cost to Sony
Not even considering litigation or regulatory costs, Sony can face some extraordinary costs.
Simply replacing a credit- or a debit-card costs the issuing bank an estimated $25. With the
potential of replacing millions of cards, this is a big expense for the issuing banks, one that Sony
mayhavetopickup.
In addition, there is the cost of the identify-theft insurance for 100 million subscribers. This is
bound to cost millions of dollars. It has been estimated that Sony’s costs for the intrusion could
rangeintheorderof$1to$2billiondollarsU.S..
Who Dunnit?
The big open question is who were the perpetrators? Sony is working with the FBI and several
select private investigation firms to try to track them down. Though there has been no definitive
word on the culprits, there is a strong suspicion. It has to do with an earlier hacking of Sony’s
PlayStation.
George Hotz, known on the web as Geohot, is a renowned and very successful 22-year old
American hacker. He is known for unlocking Apple’s iPhone, allowing it to be used with other
wirelesscarrierscontrarytoAT&T’sandApple’sintent.

Late in 2009, Hotz announced his intention to hack Sony’s PlayStation; and in January, 2010, he
posted details of how he had gained control for read/write access of the PlayStation operating
system.
OnJanuary2, 2011, Hotz took adramatic step when he
posted the root keys for the PlayStation 3 on his web
site. The keys are used by PlayStation 3 to validate that
a piece of software is legitimate. Knowing the root keys,
hackers can create custom software for the PlayStation
andcanusepiratedgames.
Sony was faced with a dilemma. The root keys can only
be changed via a hardware modification. Once made,
current games would be rendered inoperable. In
response to this threat, Sony obtained a restraining
order against Hotz on January 11th and initiated legal
action. The root keys were immediately taken off of his
GeorgeHotz(Wikipedia)
website.
Then suddenly, on April 2nd, a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack was made on the PSN
servers, taking down PlayStation games for several hours.The attack was launched byan online
distributed,decentralizedactivistgroupcallingthemselves “Anonymous.” Anonymousstatedthat
theattackwasindefenseoffreespeech–presumablyHotz’srighttopostanyinformationthathe
wantedto.
On April 11, 2011, Sony and Hotz announced that the lawsuit had been settled on the condition
that Hotz would never again hack Sony products. Anonymous declared that it would intensify its
attacks on Sony and called for a day of protest on April 16th. The intrusion to Sony’s servers and
theftofuserinformationoccurredfromApril16thtoApril18th.
Interestingly, during the investigation of the break-in, the investigators found a calling card of
sorts stored on a server. It was a file named “Anonymous” and contained the message, “We are
Legion.” This led to the suspicion that Anonymous was the culprit. However, Anonymous denied
involvement, saying that “We are trying to fight criminal activities by corporations and
governments, not steal credit cards.” George Hotz also condemned the attack, noting that
stealingdatabaseswasmuchdifferentthathackingtogainplayaccess.
Thejuryisstillout.
Lessons Learned
Beware of hackers. They can do serious damage if they want to. And they are probably smarter
than you are. Even worse, this incident shows that they are a loosely knit group that can be
fiercelyloyaltoeachother.
Sony has learned a great deal from this incident, unfortunately at great cost. As Sony
summarizeditsreplytotheU.S.Congressinitsblog:
“We are taking a number of steps to prevent future breaches, including enhanced levels of
data protection and encryption; enhanced ability to detect software intrusions, unauthorized
access and unusual activity patterns; additional firewalls; establishment of a new data center

Theyareallgooddefensestoconsider.
