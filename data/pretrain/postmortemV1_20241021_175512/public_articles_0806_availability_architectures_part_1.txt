Responding to the recognition that availability and disaster recovery are not simply luxuries for
information technology, institutions now implement broad measures to protect all their IT assets. What
had been a niche business for areas that had clear business justification (e.g., ATM/cash machine
networks) has become a standard data center practice or infrastructure-based service offering. Together
with the increased technological support for availability, applications increasingly define themselves as
requiring higher levels of business critical support, generally expressed as high availability and disaster
recovery. This ‘white glove’ treatment is now the norm in many information industries, particularly the
financeindustry.
Often, even though applications define themselves as requiring high availability, they do not adapt their
programming models to support this. It is simpler for an application to leverage support services in the
infrastructure, such as duplicated disk storage, replicated SAN storage and heightened data center-wide
backup and recovery. Processes and failover tests are used as after-the-fact assurance that the
measures adopted are satisfactory or can be remediated. Infrastructure, in turn, is often optimized to
seamlessly provide these capabilities with no direct connection to the actual business or application
requirements which invoked them in the first place. Ultimately, the proverbial cart is often placed in front
of the horse, with the data center needs taking on a life of their own, regardless of the application or
business requirements. A trend like this can result in costly, excessive and ineffective investments in
availability--almostasbadasituationastheoppositeextremeofnoavailabilitysupport.
At this point, architects might well interject themselves into the topic. As depicted in Figure 1, the goal of
an architected approach is to provide the most cost effective strategy, while offering the needed level of
protection.

Defining Availability
Availability can take a range of characteristics and can be viewed from multiple technology and business
viewpoints. For example, is an application available if it can only process half its projected volume (as
illustratedinFigure2,below)?Whatifthathappensafteradeclaredevent(disaster)?

Similar questions can be asked about data availability. Is data available if it is out of date, corrupted or of
uncertainquality? Is data actually available if you can only retrieve it together with extraneous material,
whichmayconfuseordelayitsrecovery?Whataboutrarelyaccessedhistoricaldata?
While there is no single right answer for these questions, we provide a basic definition for availability
whichcanthenbeadjustedtosuitspecificbusinessconditions.
Definition: An application or system is available when it can correctly process its normal expected
volume of business. It is recovered from a declared fault when it can reach that same processing
criterion. Data is available only if it has no corruption or inconsistency; a subset of data may be
consideredavailable,evenifthefulldatasetisnot.

Categorize the business requirements
Much of the IT industry has realized that availability and disaster recovery are requirements for
applications that are significant to the business. What was once the province of niche applications and
vendors (Tandem/NonStop, Stratus/S88, Dec-FT, with their warring “5-nines” of availability claims), now
appliesacrosstheboardtoallbusinessapplicationsandareas.
A typical way to communicate the business requirements for availability is to specify a level of criticality:
High/Medium/Low. While this terminology may be intelligible to the business, it is far from obvious what
requirement this places on an application. Also, there is more than a single dimension to availability.
Commonly used technical descriptors, including “Mean Time Between Failures” (MTBF), “Mean Time to
Repair” (MTTR), “Recovery Time Objective” (RTO), and, “Recovery Point Objective” (RPO), are deeply
technicalinnatureandnotobvioustothebusinessiii.
The classification terminology for business requirements should be natural, but fairly precise to satisfy
both sides of the communication. A framework for this terminology would be to define an “Availability
Class” definition (AC-n) with both business criteria and technical specifications. Each AC would cover a
defined range of cases that would not overlap with the other classes. The granularity of such an AC
systemdependsonthenatureofthebusinessrequirements:
 Athreetier(AC-1,AC-2,AC-3)systemwouldintuitivelycorrespondtohigh/medium/low
availability.
 Afourtiersystem(AC-1,…,AC-4)couldadda‘super’highavailabilityrating.
 Themiddletiercouldbesubdividedfordifferent(data)recoverytimeswiththesame
basicoutageclassofservice.
 Anextratiercouldbedefinedtospecifythecharacteristicsofauniquebusinessor
technologyenvironment,e.g.,high-frequencytradingorremoteofficeapplications,or,
usingcloudorco-locatedtechnology,etc.
For these tier definitions, disaster recoveryand high availabilityservice levels are treated as one subject,
buttheycouldbetreatedas distinctbusiness andtechnologyproblems.Ingeneral,disaster recoverycan
be included in the availability service tier, but it may also entail wider support issues, such as remote or
secondary access, and, transportation and housing for alternative venues. The wider scope might raise
theneedtoclassifyapplicationsfortheserequirementsseparatelyfromtheavailabilitytiers.
As one such example, we present a table (Figure 3) for a three tier classification, specifying the AC, key
technicalcriteriaandbusinesscriteria.

In the table, AC-1 specifies “3-nines” of availability. This means that a business owner can expect to
provide service with almost no outages (total annual outage time measured in minutes to hours). RTO of
4 hours means that any outage is resolved in less than a business day, while the RPO means that only
themostrecentactivitycouldbelostorcorruptedas aresultofanoutage. AC-1isanexpensiveservice.
Generally, this is the highest class of service that an enterprise would provide and should be restricted to
business areas that can demonstrate the value or requirement for this sort of service. Typically,
transactionsthatcapturemonetaryobligations(sales,orders,trades,payments,etc.)andthatoccurinan
online real-time fashion are candidates for this service. Higher service levels (e.g., more “nines”, quicker
RTO, continuous availability with no data loss) could be defined either as a subset of this class or as a
separateavailabilitytier,iftherewasaspecificbusinessrequirementinthisarea.
AC-2 would usuallybe considered ‘standard’ service. A good expectation of availability(hours to days of
outage per year) is specified, with outages resolved by the next day and data recovered from the end of
the previous business day. This service class is generally applicable to any application whose business
value is not seriously disrupted if the process is stalled for a day. Most reporting functions and analysis
activitiescantoleratethislevelofavailability.
AC-3 represents a ‘best efforts’ service level intended for utilityor internal applications which can tolerate
being at risk of failure and moderate data loss. Even these applications will have a fairly high level of
availability service, simply because standard modern technology and processes have a high level of
quality built into them. Applications in this tier would receive the lowest prioritization during any recovery
activity. Note that a business could architect AC-3 as their standard infrastructure support and require
applications to engineer their own higher availability using software techniques. An example of this was
the approach provided to Amazon Web Services customers, where lowest cost for basic services was a
keyrequirement.
There could well be special case exceptions to the tiering system. For example data-warehouse
applications may be regarded as critical to the business, but not worth the extreme cost required to put
them in AC-1. Furthermore, data loss is not an issue for these systems, in general, since they are
consuming information generated from the enterprise which may most efficiently be recreated from the
source systems rather than restored from a data-warehouse replica or back-up. On the other extreme,
market data systems are viewed as critical in financial enterprises, but maynot have the RTO (data loss)
requirement since the data becomes historical and of low value in a very short time. While counter-
intuitive,theAC-2orevenAC-3ratingmightbemoreappropriateforthesesystems!
