TransactionAuthorization
As eachpayment-cardtransaction is processedbya POSterminal,it is sentto its HPNonStopserver for
preauthorizationfraudchecks.
TheNonStopserver sends thetransactionover theappropriatetransaction-switchingnetwork tothebank
that issued the payment card. The issuing bank decides whether or not to authorize the transaction and
returnsan‘accept’or‘reject’responsetothePOSterminal.
TransactionSettlementViaOmniReplicator
Eachserverlogsitsowntransactionactivity.However,toensurethedurabilityoftransactionsintheevent
of a server failure, the transaction logs on each of the two servers are synchronized via OmniReplicator.
Wheneveratransactionisenteredintothetransactionlogofoneserver,itisimmediatelyreplicatedtothe
transaction log of the other server via OmniReplicator’s bidirectional replication capability. Thus, each
serverhasarecordofalltransactionsmadebybothservers.
At the end of the day, either log may be used to send transaction information to the chain’s acquiring
bank for settlement and clearing. During this process, funds are transferred in settlement of the day’s
transactionsfromtheissuingbankstothechain’saccountheldbyitsacquiringbank.
DataCollisions
Data collisions in this active/active system are highly unlikely because there is only a very small
probabilitythatthesamecardwillbeusedattwoPOSterminalssimultaneously.
If a husband and wife should use their cards simultaneously to make purchases at two POS terminals
connected to the same NonStop server, transaction locking will prevent data collisions. However, if they
should use their cards simultaneously at POS terminals connected to different NonStop servers, there is
still no problem. Each system will independently forward its transaction to the issuing bank, which will
probablyauthorizeboth. Eachsystem willthen writethetransactionto its logfile. Eachtransaction willbe
replicated to the transaction log of the other system, and both transactions will be sent at the end of the
daytotheacquiringbankforsettlement.Thegrocerychainwillbereimbursedforeachtransaction.
CorrespondentBanks
In addition to the supermarket stores, the new OmniPayments system also supports what is known as
correspondent banks. In the country served by the grocery chain, small, rural villages often have no
supermarkets, no banks, and, in some case, no Internet service. In many of these communities, the
grocery chain has set up one or more local merchants with POS terminals. A merchant can then sell
goods viacreditcards anddebitcards andcanexecuteother transactions suchas thecell-phonetopping
and banking services provided by the chain’s grocery stores. These merchants are called correspondent
banksbecausetheyextendbankingservicestothesmallvillages.
The correspondent bank POS terminals are connected to the active/active NonStop servers just as are
thein-storePOSterminalssothattheirtransactionscanbeauthorizedbytheissuingbanks.
OmniReplicatorManagement
The OmniReplicator replication channel is managed by OmniConsole, a component of OmniPayments.
OmniConsole integrates all of the functions that are delivered by OmniPayments, such as replication-
channel monitoring; selecting files for replication; starting, stopping and restarting OmniReplicator;
defining master keys; sending encryption keys to POS terminals; and creating batch schedules for
OmniScheduler. OmniConsole is a web service, so the management of OmniPayments can be
undertakenfromanylocation.

OmniConsole includes two major facilities necessary for system management – OmniOffender and
OmniDash. OmniOffender is an interactive performance monitor for NonStop systems. It displays
parameters such as NonStop server CPU time utilization, CPU resource usage, process utilization, disk
utilization,andfileactivity.
OmniDash is a real-time dashboard. It displays many statistics, such as the total number and amount of
purchases and other transactions for all POS terminals, the volume of usage for each POS terminal, the
volumeof transactiondenials,andthestatus of eachPOSterminal.This information is vitaltothechain’s
abilitytomanageitsPOSterminalnetwork.
OmniScheduler is the OmniPayments component that schedules batch jobs. It performs similar functions
toHPNonStopNetBatch.Forinstance,itisOmniSchedulerthatcontrolstheend-of-daybatchprocessing

Other Benefits Achieved by the Grocery Chain
Achieving continuous availability via OmniReplicator is only one of the many benefits that the chain
obtainedbymovingtoOmniPayments.
Encryption
The new system now provides encryption for data in-flight and at-rest via OmniPayments’ OmniCrypto
facility.OmniCryptosupports POStransactionsecurity,keymanagement,Public KeyInfrastructure(PKI),
encryption, and tamper-proofing of database files. It manages passwords and credentials for user
authenticationandrole-basedAccessControlListsforuserauthorization.
WithOmniCryptoinplace,thegrocerychainisnowPCIDSScompliant.
EliminationofIn-StoreServers
The 300 in-store servers are no longer needed in the grocery stores. All functions that had been carried
outbytheseserversarenowperformedviatheOmniPaymentsBusinessLogicModules.Thesefunctions
includecell-phonetopping,customerbankaccountmanagement,andbillpayments.
POSExpandedFunctions
The chain now can easily add functions to its POS terminals without having to roll out upgrades to 300
storeservers.Rather,thefunctionsaresimplyaddedtotheOmniPaymentsswitch.
One such new function is loyalty cards. As customers make purchases at the chain’s grocery stores,
points are added to their loyalty cards. The customer can use these points to purchase additional
products at the chain’s stores. Loyalty-card processing is one of the new functions to be supported by
OmniPayments. OmniPayments will maintain loyalty-card balances in its database and will furnish loyalty
credits to customers on demand. The loyalty balances will be replicated between the NonStop systems
via OmniReplicator so that both systems will have access to customer loyalty accounts. Replication also
willprotecttheloyaltyaccountbalancesintheeventofaNonStopserverfailure.
SmartCardProcessing
OmniPayments supports all aspects of EMV smart-card processing. EMV POS terminals are supported
as are the communication protocols required to pass EMV transactions to the issuing banks and EMV
settlementdatatothechain’sacquiringbank.

ReducedLicensingCosts
OmniPayments substantially reduced the grocery chain’s licensing costs. This is because the
OmniPayments license fee is based on the size of the NonStop systems rather than on the previous
year’stransactionvolume,asisthecasewithmanyotherfinancialtransactionswitches.
The OmniPayments Financial Transaction Switch
Opsol’s OmniPayments financial-transaction switch is shown in Figure 5. The core layer of
OmniPayments is Opsol’s OmniDirector Enterprise Service Bus. OmniDirector services include data
transformation, encryption, intelligent routing, and
communication-failure recovery. It also implements
adapters to support those protocols required to
communicate with the chain’s POS terminals as well as
withtheinternationalfinancialswitchingnetworks.
Business logic modules, or BLMs, provide the business
functions of OmniPayments. These functions include
credit-card and debit-card authorization services. The
BLMs are extensible to supply the other services that
the chain offers or plans to offer its customers via its
POSterminals.
OmniPayments supports complete logging of all
transactions via its OmniLogger module. The logs
contain the transaction information needed at the end of
each day for clearing and settlement. It is this
processing function that transfers funds from the card-
issuing banks to the chain’s merchant account held by
itsacquiringbanktoreflecttheday’ssalesactivities.
Summary
The grocerychain was faced with a tough decision when ACI announced its termination of support for its
BASE24financial-transactionswitchonHPNonStopsystems.Iteitherhadtomakeamajorinvestmentto
convert its applications to run on an alternate platform or it had to move to another transaction switch on
the HP NonStop. After a great deal of study and analysis, it chose the latter and decided to go with
OmniPaymentsfromOpsolIntegrators.
As a result, the grocery chain recognized several improvements in the functionality of its financial-
transactionsystem:
 It achieved continuous availability for its grocery stores via OmniReplicator’s active/active
architecture.
 ItbecamePCIDSScompliantwithencryptionofdatain-flightandat-rest.
 Itmovedtoanimproved,industry-standardcommunicationprotocolforitsPOSterminals.
 ItsupportsEMVsmartcards,thepaymentcardsofthefuture.
 Iteliminatedits300in-storeserversthatmanageditsPOSterminals.
 It is now able to add new functionality in the OmniPayments switch rather than having to roll
upgradesto300in-storeservers.
 Itsignificantlyreduceditslicensefeesforthetransactionswitch.
OmniPayments includes several stand-alone modules, most of which are bundled into OmniPayments
and are not sold separately. These modules include OmniReplicator, OmniConsole, OmniDash, and
OmniLogger.However,OmniCryptoandOmniOffenderaresoldasseparateproducts.
