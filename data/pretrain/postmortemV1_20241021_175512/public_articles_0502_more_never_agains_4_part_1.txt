More Never Agains IV
February2010
It is once again time to reflect on the damage that IT systems can inflict on us mere humans.We
havecomealongwayinensuringthehighavailabilityofourdata-processingsystems.Butasthe
following stories show, we still have a ways to go. During the last six months, hardware/software
andnetwork faults sharedresponsibility,eachcausing aboutone-third of theoutages.Therestof
the outages were caused by a variety of problems such as power failures, construction mishaps,
andhacking.
RackspaceHitwithAnotherOutage
Techcrunch, June 20, 2009 – On June 20, Rackspace suffered yet another outage1 due to a
power failure. The breaker on the primary utility feed powering one of its nine data centers
tripped, causing data center’s generators to start up. However, a field excitation failure escalated
to the point that the generators became overloaded. An attempt by Rackspace to fail over to its
secondary utility feed failed because the transfer switch malfunctioned. When the data center’s
batteriesranout,thedatacenter wentdown.Failovers dofail.Haveacontingencyplannomatter

NYSESuffersSeveralOutagesinLessThanaMonth
Reuters,July2, 2009 –On Thursdaymorning,July2, brokers onthefloor of the New York Stock
Exchange found that they could not route orders, causing the NYSE to halt trading in some
stocks and to extend the trading day. During the previous month, a software glitch halted trading;
and an order-matching problem affected timely order reconciliation. The Exchange has now
implemented a new order-processing system that reduces order-execution time from about 100
millisecondstofivemilliseconds.However,brokerswantmicrosecondorder-processingtimes.

GoogleAppsDownforHours
Softpedia, July 3, 2009 – Access to the Google Apps Datastore went down for the morning on
July 3. Google Apps is Google’s answer to cloud-based development and hosting. The outage
affected the entire Google Apps cluster. The problem started when the Datastore went into read-
only mode with all writes disabled, but the problem quickly escalated to a total failure. All Google
Apps applications were downfor over four hours.Therehas been no explanation as tothecause
oftheproblem.
MySQL.comGoesOutJustBeforeanUpgrade
The Register, July 22, 2009 – A power outage in Uppsala, Sweden, took down the MySQL web
site for almost a day. The outage prevented the open community’s developers from accessing
MySQL source code, documentation, discussion groups, and bug tracking. Interestingly, Sun
Microsystems, which owns MySQL, had planned to upgrade the data center that weekend
specifically to avoid an outage due to power failures. Bad timing. Many are waiting to see if
OracleisgoingtocontinuetosupportMySQLfollowingitsacquisitionofSun.
UnderseaCableFaultTakesOutInternetthroughoutWestAfrica
Africa News, July 30, 2009 – There is only one fiber-optic cable linking West Africa to the rest of
the world; and on July 30, the landing cable linking Nigeria failed. 70% of Nigerian Internet
services went down, and other neighboring countries lost 100%. Though Nigeria had built a
redundant land network, there was no backup for the landing cable. The only way to reroute
traffic was over limited, expensive satellite channels. Banking services, phone services, and
Internet services were all impacted. It took days to repair the cable and to return service to these
countries.
CiscoTakesDownitsOwnNetwork–Twice
The Register, August 5, 2009 – A human error was responsible for knocking Cisco’s web site
offline for three hours. Evidently, a maintenance update caused an “electrical overload.” System
administrators were unable to access Cisco’s support resources just after Cisco announced four
security vulnerabilities in its network products. This wasn’t the first time that Cisco stepped on its
own toes. In August, 2007, a preventative maintenance error knocked out the Cisco network for
anotherthreehours.Inneithercasedidthebackupfacilitieskickin.

The Register, August 5, 2009 – O2 is the UK network that exclusively provides mobile services
for the Apple iPhone. In July and August, the network went down on four different occasions,
leaving iPhone users without email and Internet services for hours at a time. O2’s problems
ranged from a fire in a London substation to a 2G network GPRS (ground packet radio service)
satellite issue, a DHCP (dynamic host configuration protocol) problem, and the failure of the

aging email system was slowly being migrated to an Exchange Server environment when the

RouterFailureTakesDownWestJet Airlines
Calgary Herald, August 7, 2009 – A router in WestJet’s Calgary network center took down the
airline’s computer system that it uses to check in passengers. The router was redundant, and its
backupshouldhavetakenoverimmediately.Theproblemwas,therouterdidn’tquitedie.Though
it failed to forward traffic, it was not sick enough for its backup to take over. About 1,000
passengers were affected for over an hour, and several flights out of Toronto and Montreal were
seriouslydelayed.

TexasLosesAccesstoitsBusinessRecords
Marshall News Messenger, August 12, 2009 – A computer hardware fault cut access to the
business records kept by the Texas’ Secretaryof State. The outage lasted for almost two weeks.
During this time, business incorporations, real-estate closings, voter registrations, and other
activities were put on hold. The hardware fault was in a data center managed by IBM and its
partners as part of an $863 million contract to consolidate data-center operations across state
agencies.
TyphoonDisruptsEast AsianInternetandVoiceServices
Reuters, August 13, 2009 – From August 9 to August 12, users in Taiwan, Singapore, Hong
Kong, and the Philippines watched their Internet services deteriorate from slow to none. It turns
out that Typhoon Morakat damaged several undersea cables, not directly, but through undersea
landslides. The landslides occurred over a several day period, breaking cables one at a time.
Though it may take months to repair the cables, service was restored within a week by rerouting
trafficoverothernetworks.

DNAResultsScrambledbyHardwareIncompatibility
Bio-IT World, August 27, 2009 – deCODEme is a genome service that will analyze up to one-
million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a client’s DNA. One client found that the
presentation of his results differed on different browsers. Several dozen SNPs were presented
differentlydepending upon the browser used. Itturns outthat the problem was anincompatibility
with 32-bit processors. The presentations were correct on 64-bit processors. The problem has
