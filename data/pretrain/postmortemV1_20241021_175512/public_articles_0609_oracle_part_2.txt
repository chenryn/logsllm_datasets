The communication channel can be any medium that supports IP. There is no geographical limit on the
separationofthesourcesystemfromthetargetsystem.
Data changes are delivered to the Delivery process from the target-side Trail File if there is one or
otherwise directly from the communication channel. The Delivery process uses the changes to update
thetargetdatabase.
The Manager controls the GoldenGate processes on its node via a command-line interface. It provides
the facilities for configuration, critical event and threshold monitoring, log resource management, and the
managementandpurgingofoldTrailFiles.
GoldenGate supports dynamic rollback and reconstruction of a database for rapid recovery from errors
that may have contaminated the database. Before-images are used to create reverse transactions to a
specified point in time that is known to correspond to an accurate database. After-images are then used
tocreatetransactionstoreturnthedatabasetoitspropercurrentstate.
Configuration
Flexible network technologies are supported. GoldenGate can be configured in a multinode peer-to-peer
configuration (active/active). It can be configured to broadcast data changes from a master database to
multiple slave databases or to consolidate changes made to several database copies onto a master
database.Itcansupportcascadingofdatadownamultitiereddatabasestructure.

Oracle Streams
Oracle Streams enables the sharing of messages via a message stream.6 The stream can propagate
information to other databases or applications. Stream rules route specified information to specified
destinations.
Streams accomplishes data replication by propagating changes from a source database to a destination
database. Streams can be configured for bidirectional data replication, and it provides data collision
detectionandresolution.

Architecture
Changes made to tables, schemas, or an entire database are recorded in the Oracle redo log for the
database. A Capture process fetches changes from the redo log and formats each change into a
message, which is placed in a persistent queue. Users and applications can also enqueue messages.
Streams propagates messages from one queue to another. The destination queues can be in the same
databaseorindifferentdatabases.
An Apply process at the destination dequeues messages from a queue. The Apply process can apply
messagesdirectlytodestinationdatabases,oritcanpassmessagestocustomprogramsforprocessing.
TheCaptureProcess
Changes made to database objects in an Oracle database are logged in the redo log to guarantee
recoverability in the event of user error or media failure. A Capture process formats these changes into
messages andenqueues them.Therearetwotypes ofmessages.Onetypecontains informationabouta
change to a row in a table resulting from a DML (data manipulation language) operation. The other
containsinformationaboutaDDL(datadefinitionlanguage)changetoadatabaseobject.
TheApplyProcess
An Apply process dequeues messages from a destination queue and either applies each message
directly to a destination database or passes the message to a user-defined procedure. User defined
procedures include message handlers, DML handlers, DDL handlers, precommit handlers, and error
handlers.
Typically, an Apply process applies messages to the local database where it is running; but in a
heterogeneous database environment, it can be configured to apply messages to a remote non-Oracle
database.
UserMessaging
A user or application can also enqueue and dequeue messages. Oracle Streams enables user
applications to enqueue messages into a queue, propagate messages to subscribing queues, notify user
applications that messages are ready for consumption, and dequeue messages at the destination.
Streams supports all the standard features of message queuing systems, including multiconsumer
queues, publish and subscribe, content-based routing, Internet propagation, transformations, and
gatewaystoothermessagingsubsystems.
DataReplication
For data replication purposes, Streams can capture DML and DDL changes made to a source database
and replicate those changes to one or more destination databases. A Streams Capture process captures
changes made to source database objects and formats them into messages that can be propagated to
destinationqueues,fromwheretheyarethenappliedbyStreamsApplyprocesses.
Streams canreplicatechanges bidirectionallybetween databases.Thetables for which data is shareddo
not need to be identical copies at all databases. Both the structure and the contents of these tables can

Configuration
DataProtection
Data protection is achieved by creating a remote copy of a production database. In the event of human
error or a catastrophe, the copy can be used to resume processing. This capability can also be
accomplishedwithOracleDataGuard,whichusessomeofthesameinfrastructureasStreams.
Rules
Streams Capture processes and Apply processes perform actions based on rules. Rules specify which
events are captured, propagated, applied, and dequeued. The ability to capture events and propagate
them to relevant consumers based on rules means that Streams can be used for event notification.
Messages representing events can be staged in a queue and dequeued explicitly by a messaging client
or anapplication. Actions canthenbetakenbasedon theseevents,suchas emailnotificationor sending
amessagetoacellphoneorpager.
DataWarehouseLoading
Data warehouse loading is a special case of data replication. Some of the most critical tasks in creating
and maintaining a data warehouse include refreshing existing data and adding new data from the
operational databases. Streams components can capture changes made to a production system and
sendthosechangestoastagingdatabaseordirectlytoadatawarehouseoroperationaldatastore.

AutomaticConflictDetectionandResolution
An Apply process detects conflicts automatically when applying messages in a bidirectional replication
environment. A conflict results when the same row in the source database and the destination database
ischangedatapproximatelythesametime.
Streams offers a variety of prebuilt conflict handlers to resolve conflicts. In addition, users can build their
ownconflictresolutionhandlers.If aconflictis notresolved or if ahandler procedureraises an error,then
all messages in the transaction that raised the error are saved in the error queue for later analysis and
possiblereexecution.
OracletoNon-OracleDataSharing
To share DML changes from an Oracle source database with a non-Oracle destination database, the
Oracle database functions as a proxy and carries out some of the steps that would normally be done at
the destination database. The messages intended for the non-Oracle destination database are dequeued
in the Oracle database itself, and an Apply process at the Oracle database applies the messages to the
non-Oracledatabase
To capture and propagate changes from a non-Oracle database to an Oracle database, a custom
application is required at the non-Oracle source database. The application fetches changes made to the
non-Oracle database by reading from transaction logs, by using triggers, or via some other method. The
application must assemble and order the transactions and must convert each change into a message.

Summary
Oracle is making a major shift in its data replication strategy, moving from Oracle Streams to its newly
acquired GoldenGate replication engine. Industry conjecture is that the heterogeneous capabilities of
GoldenGate that are lacking in Streams give Oracle a powerful way to integrate its database into
environments that currently do not use Oracle. GoldenGate will provide the mechanism for Oracle to
become the database of record in these environments, accepting data from other databases and
distributingitscentralizeddatatothosedatabases.
