WhytheAirlineIndustryCouldKeepSufferingSystemFailuresLikeDelta's
Delta canceled about 530 flights on Tuesday, August 9th in addition to about 1,000 canceled a day
earlier after a power outage in Atlanta brought down the company's computers and ground the
airline's operation virtually to a halt. Seth Kaplan, who follows the airline industry, asks the question
on everyone's mind: "If every small business on the corner can manage to keep its website running
through a cloud-based server and all those sorts of things, why can't Delta Air Lines with all its
resourcesmanagetodothat?"

Delta Datacenter Crash: Do the Math on Disaster Recovery ROI
How on earth could a companythe size and scope of Delta—a company whose verybusiness relies
on its ability to process, store, and manage fast-changing data—fall prey to a systems-wide outage
that broughtits business to a grinding halt?Wecan look to the official answer, which boilsdown to a
cascading power outage and its far-reaching impacts. But the point here is not about this particular
outage. It’s not about Delta either since other major airlines have suffered equally horrendous
interruptions to their operations. The real question here is how companies’ mission-critical data can
be frozen following an outage and how no disaster recovery or failover plan is stepped up to tackle
theprobleminreal-time.

WhatCIOscanlearnfromtheDeltaOutage
Delta is not the first airline to face widespread computer system failures, and it likely won’t be the
last. In 2015, Quartz began tracking the tech glitches plaguing airlinesand preventing them from
operating normally. Since then, it has tracked 24 significant airline system failures. Delta’s recent
outage affected Delta’s entire network because the company’s control points are centralized.
Though running route scheduling, ticketing and check-ins over a single network is cost-effective,
the system only runs smoothly while the central control points are available. What can CIOs learn
from Delta’sissues?

Poweroutageon AranIslandsleadstofreshdemandsforrenewables
The prolonged electricity blackout affecting two of the Aran Islands (Ireland) has given renewed
impetus to making the islands carbon-neutral. All three islands lost power after a sub-sea cable at
the mouth of Gregory’s Sound was ruptured in early August. The island of Inis Mór regained supply
several hours later that same day. But its two neighbouring islands faced significant hardship for

Latest thread on LinkedIn's "Continuous Availability Forum": Does Hadoop Provide The
AvailabilityRequiredbytheIoT?Wehave768members.
I sometimes feel that I am a lone voice promoting the concept of continuous availability (four or five
9s, or five minutes of downtime per year) for mission-critical systems. I encounter serious pushback
from colleagues who feel that the norm of three 9s achieved by most systems (eight hours of
downtime per year) is sufficient, and indeed many mission-critical systems achieve no better
availability than this. Now we have the emergence of the Internet of Things. Gleaning useful insight
from such a large mass of data in the brief time during which the data is most useful requires
continuous availability. Hadoop has become the preferred big-data processor to perform this
function.DoesHadoopprovidetheavailabilitythatisneededtomaximizethebenefitoftheIoT?
