| ABSTRACT: The Apollo 11 mission succeeded in landing on the moon      |
| despite two computer-related problems that affected the Lunar Module  |
| during the powered descent. An uncorrected problem in the rendezvous  |
| radar interface stole approximately 13% of the computer\'s duty       |
| cycle, resulting in five program alarms and software restarts. In a   |
| less well-known problem, caused by erroneous data, the thrust of the  |
| LM\'s descent engine fluctuated wildly because the throttle control   |
| algorithm was only marginally stable. The explanation of these        |
| problems provides an opportunity to describe the operating system of  |
| the Apollo flight computers and the lunar landing guidance software.  |

| LM-1, also known as Apollo 5, was a 6-hour unmanned mission in earth  |
| orbit for the Lunar Module (LM) only. The date was January 22, 1968.  |
| For those of us who developed the onboard software for the LM         |
| Guidance Computer (LGC) it was our first flight. An event that had    |
| once seemed impossibly distant was now upon us.                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The mission included two firings of the LM\'s Descent Propulsion      |
| System (DPS). For the second \"burn\" Allan Klumpp, who designed the  |
| lunar landing guidance equations\[1\] based on work by George         |
| Cherry\[2\], had devised an earth-orbit version of the lunar landing  |
| guidance. It had three parts, meant to simulate the \"braking\"       |
| phase, \"visibility\" phase, and final landing phase of a real        |
| descent. But first there was a burn meant to simulate the descent     |
| orbit insertion maneuver that preceded the landing. This was to be    |
| the first in-flight firing of the LM\'s descent engine, lasting about |
| 38 seconds.                                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The LGC was in Phase 9 of the \"canned\" LM-1 mission, the program    |
| for the first DPS burn. (Later missions were organized more flexibly  |
| and the first DPS burn was conducted in P40.) The LM had maneuvered   |
| to the burn attitude. The computer counted down to ignition. At       |
| thirty seconds a \"task\" called READACCS was executed for the first  |
| time. It read the accelerometers in the spacecraft\'s inertial        |
| measurement unit, scheduled a \"job\" called SERVICER to run          |
| immediately, and then scheduled itself to run again two seconds       |
| later. Having been initialized with state vectors from the onboard    |
| orbital integration software, SERVICER\'s \"average-G\" navigation    |
| equations began to use accelerometer data to update the position and  |
| velocity vectors. READACCS and SERVICER would repeat every two        |
| seconds throughout the powered-flight phase. Seven and a half seconds |
| before ignition an \"ullage\" burn of the Reaction Control System     |
| (RCS) jets began, to settle the propellant in the DPS tanks. We       |
| leaned closer to the squawk box that connected us to mission control  |
| in Houston.                                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| We heard \"Engine on\"\... several seconds passed\... \"Engine off\". |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Soon we understood what had happened. A small piece of code in        |
| SERVICER called the \"delta-V monitor\" had concluded that the engine |
| had failed and sent an engine-off command. But why? To give the       |
| engine time to come up to thrust, the delta-V monitor always waited   |
| some period of time after engine-on before it began to monitor the    |
| engine. But this time, at the end of the grace period the engine was  |
| still not producing enough thrust to satisfy the monitor\'s thrust    |
| criterion.                                                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Published accounts\[3\] have attributed the slow DPS thrust buildup   |
| to the fact that the LM\'s tanks were only partially pressurized. The |
| author\'s investigations show that the problem was elsewhere. For the |
| DPS fuel system, the normal procedure was to open the valve that      |
| allowed fuel to enter the propellant manifold at the time the engine  |
| was armed, several seconds before ignition. But on LM-1 the control   |
| valve that regulated the passage of fuel from the manifold into the   |
| engine was suspected of being leaky. To prevent the possible,         |
| premature entry of hypergolic propellant into the engine (which could |
| have had explosive consequences) the decision was made, shortly       |
| before flight, to delay arming the engine until the time of           |
| ignition\[4\].                                                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The engine was slow to start not because the tanks were less          |
| pressurized, but because the propellant had further to travel to      |
| reach the engine. It would have been easy for us to adjust the        |
| parameter that controlled how long the delta-V monitor waited before  |
| testing the engine --- but nobody told us.                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Houston sent a signal to turn off the onboard computer. The main      |
| objectives of the LM-1 mission were achieved under ground control. We |
| who programmed the LM\'s computer hung our heads in disappointment,   |
| and endured a public reaction that did not distinguish between a      |
| \"computer error\" and a mistake in the data. Yet, this was not the   |
| last time that a seemingly innocuous parameter, relating to the       |
| performance of the descent engine, would come perilously close to     |
| ruining a mission.                                                    |

| The job of designing the guidance system for the Apollo spacecraft    |
| had fallen to the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory in Cambridge,        |
| Massachusetts. Under the leadership of its founder \"Doc\" Charles    |
| Stark Draper, the Lab had since 1939 played the preeminent role in    |
| perfecting inertial guidance systems. Our contract to design and      |
| program the Apollo Primary Guidance Navigation and Control System     |
| (PGNCS, pronounced \"pings\") was the first Apollo contract signed.   |
| Doc had volunteered to fly the mission himself.                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (In 1970 the Instrumentation Laboratory was renamed the Charles Stark |
| Draper Laboratory, and in 1973 became independent from MIT, although  |
| the two institutions remain linked. The Draper Laboratory is still    |
| deeply involved in NASA\'s manned spaceflight programs.)              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The flight computer program for LM-1 was called SUNBURST. By the time |
| LM-1 flew we were already working on SUNDANCE, the program that would |
| fly the earth-orbital Apollo 9 mission. SUNDANCE in turn evolved into |
| LUMINARY, the program for Apollo 10 and the lunar landing missions.   |
| It was LUMINARY revision 99 that flew the Apollo 11 mission in July,  |
| 1969. Revision 116 flew Apollo 12 in December, and so on.             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (This paper follows nomenclature used during the Apollo Program.      |
| Program names, and the names of tags and variables within programs,   |
| were usually written in upper case.)                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Informally, the programs were called \"ropes\" because of the durable |
| form of read-only memory into which they were transformed for flight, |
| which resembled a rope of woven copper wire. For the lunar missions,  |
| 36K words of \"fixed\" (read-only) memory, each word consisting of 15 |
| bits plus a parity bit, were available for the program. In addition   |
| there were 2K words of artfully timeshared \"erasable\" or RAM        |
| memory. Allowing for the identical Apollo guidance computer (AGC) in  |
| the Command Module (CM), containing a program called COLOSSUS, it is  |
| correct to say that we landed on the moon with 152 Kbytes of onboard  |
| computer memory.                                                      |

| The AGC was packaged in a sturdy, sealed, aluminum-magnesium box,     |
| anodized in a gold color, that measured about six inches, by one      |
| foot, by two feet, weighed 70 pounds and consumed about 55 watts. Its |
| logic was made up of 5600 3-input NOR gates packaged two-each in      |
| flat-pack integrated circuits. Eldon Hall, the machine\'s principal   |
| designer, has related the bold decision to use integrated circuit     |
| technology for this computer despite its immaturity in the early      |
| 1960\'s\[5\].                                                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The LGC (with related equipment) was mounted behind the astronauts at |
| the back of the LM cabin. In front of the astronauts was a rigid      |
| structure called the \"Nav Base\" that held an alignment telescope    |
| and the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in a fixed geometrical        |
| relationship. The computer\'s Display and Keyboard Unit (DSKY) was    |
| mounted like a desk between the two astronauts. Figure 2 illustrates  |
| the components and high-level interfaces of the LM\'s primary         |
| guidance system.                                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The IMU, packaged in a spherical case about a foot in diameter, was   |
| the heart of the guidance system. The heart of the IMU itself,        |
| enclosed by three nested gimbals, was the \"stable member\" --- a     |
| small platform containing three accurate gyroscopes and three         |
| accelerometers --- that could be \"aligned\" to an inertial           |
| orientation. Any deviation from the inertial alignment would be       |
| sensed by the gyros, and the gimbals would move to correct, all       |
| happening with such precision that no matter what attitude            |
| (orientation) the spacecraft took (almost), the stable member deep    |
| inside provided a steady attitude reference. A matrix called REFSMMAT |
| expressed the stable-member alignment with respect to the reference   |
| inertial frame. The accelerometers were there to count velocity       |
| increments during powered flight in the coordinate system of the      |
| stable member.                                                        |

| The DSKY (Figure 3) was the principal man-machine interface for the   |
| LGC. For display it provided three signed five-digit registers for    |
| general-purpose use, three two-digit registers to indicate the        |
| current phase (a number between 63 and 68 for the lunar landing), and |
| the current \"verb\" and \"noun\". Verbs and nouns provided a         |
| primitive language for communication between the crew and the         |
| computer. Phases and verb/noun combinations were determined by the    |
| software in some cases, and in other cases were entered by the crew   |
| on a keyboard of 19 keys. The contents of the three general-purpose   |
| registers depended on the current verb and noun. The DSKY also        |
| contained an array of indicator lights that were under the control of |
| the computer, and a computer-activity light that lit when the LGC was |
| *not* in its idle state.                                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The AGCs in the LM and CM were programmed in two languages. The one   |
| we called \"Basic\", but more properly \"Yul\", was an assembler      |
| language of about 40 operations\[6\], authored by Hugh Blair-Smith.   |
| \"Interpretive\" was a list-processing interpretive language          |
| (essentially a set of subroutines) designed to facilitate guidance    |
| and navigation calculations involving double precision (30-bit        |
| fixed-point) vectors and matrices --- at the cost of being very       |
| slow\[7\]. The Interpreter was written by Charles Muntz.              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The memory-cycle time for the AGC was 11.7 microseconds. A            |
| single-precision addition in the assembler language took two memory   |
| cycles. A double-precision vector cross-product programmed in         |
| Interpretive took about 5 milliseconds. One of the challenges in      |
| programming the AGC was juggling the two languages to obtain the best |
| blend of speed and compactness for the given situation.               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The computer programs for Apollo were still small enough to fit into  |
| one listing --- typically six inches thick on 11x15 inch fan-fold     |
| paper. The listing included symbol tables that allowed threads to be  |
| traced. With a single listing we always knew that the answer was      |
| there, when we had a bug to deal with, but it might be devilish to    |
| find.                                                                 |

| With respect to units, the LGC was eclectic. Inside the computer we   |
| used metric units, at least in the case of powered-flight navigation  |
| and guidance. At the operational level NASA, and especially the       |
