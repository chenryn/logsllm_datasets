VSI to Port OpenVMS to x86

term plans for current OpenVMS applications? Port them to another platform? Run them in emulation
modeonacommodityplatform?Nolong-termoptionwasveryappealing.
New Life for OpenVMS
A year later, in mid-2014, HP corrected this situation to the relief of all OpenVMS users. HP completed a
perpetual and exclusive licensing agreement with VMS Software, Inc. (VSI) to extend indefinitely the
lifespan of OpenVMS. Under the licensing agreement,VSI will be the sole developer of future versions of
OpenVMS. It will continue to support OpenVMS on HP Itanium systems and, of special note, it will port
OpenVMStox86-64servers.
Headquartered in Bolton, Massachusetts, U.S.A., VSI was created exclusively to carry on OpenVMS
developmentandsupport.ItwasformedinMay2014byagroupofinvestors,executives,anddevelopers
from Nemonix, a company that had provided OpenVMS services for older VAX and Alpha systems for
threedecades.
VSI to the Rescue
VSI immediately tackled the task of bringing OpenVMS forward. For a small company with only a few
dozen developers, it has laid out an aggressive roadmap and is planning to expand aggressively to meet
this roadmap. It expects to double its number of developers by the end of 2015 and to have 100
developersonstaffbytheendof2016.
VSI made its first deliverable within a year, OpenVMS Version 8.4-1H1. This version included upgrades

OpenVMS on x86-64 Servers
AttheOpenVMSBootCamp2015,organizedbyConnect,theHPBusinessTechnologyUserGroup,and
held in Nashua, New Hampshire, U.S.A. in September 2015, VSI laid out its plans for porting OpenVMS
to x86-64. VSI’s roadmap shows it delivering OpenVMS on x86-64 servers by 2018. There is a massive
amount of work to do to accomplish this, and many of the features in the new operating system are still
beingdetermined.WereviewbelowthecurrenteffortsbeingmadebyVSItodeterminejustwhatfeatures
itwillsupportonx86-64.
Thex86-64
The x86-64 is primarily available from Intel as the Xeon microprocessor and from AMD as the Opteron
microprocessor. It currently has the bulk of the microprocessor market place, with USD $31 billion in
revenuesachievedfromtheshipmentofalmost10millionunitsin2013.Thisrepresentsabout70%ofthe
marketintermsofrevenueand95%ofthemarketintermsofunitsshipped.
The x86-64 is based on a CISC (complex instruction set computing) architecture with over 600
instructions.Afifteen-corechipcontainsabout5.6billiontransistors.
Languages
VSIplanstosupportthefollowinglanguageswithOpenVMSonx86-64:
C
BLISS
FORTRAN
BASIC
COBOL
PASCAL
MACRO
C++
Ada
VSI will use the LLVM open-source compiler. VSI’s initial language efforts will focus on C, BLISS, and
MACRO.
Memory
VSI’s x86-64 port will support 4 KB, 2 MB, and 1 GB page sizes. The x86-64 has four memory-protection
modes. OpenVMS will run in two of these modes – Unprivileged (0) and Privileged (3). The Supervisor
mode(1)andExecmode(2)willbeimplementedinsoftware.
Virtualization
VSI is investigating the option of allowing an OpenVMS virtual machine to run as a guest operating
system under the VMware, kvm, and/or xen hypervisors. VSI is currently using CentOS-7/kvm on an HP
ProliantDL380Gen8asadevelopmentplatform
Clouds
Various cloud-application interfaces are being considered, including AWS, OpenStack, Rackspace, and
Apacheclouds.

Summary
VSI’s planned port of OpenVMS to the x86-64 microprocessor will open a broad market for OpenVMS.
With HPE’s port of its NonStop fault-tolerant operating system to its x86 blades (now the NonStop X),
VSI’s port will give mission-critical applications another hardened operating system to run on commodity
servers.
