More Never Agains II
February2009
Despite its title, this is the fourth in our semi-annual series of brief recaps of some of the many
computing-system failures that have occurred over the last six months.1 Unlike prior recaps,
power outages do not lead the list of failures this time. Network outages were the most
predominant, accounting for over a third of all failures. Operator errors accounted for almost 20%
offaults,rangingfromonethatdestroyedacompanytoGoogle’sdisablingofitssearchengine.
OperatorErrorDeniesPaycheckstoTensofThousands
The Age, Friday, July 3, 2008 – Tens of thousands of Australia’s Westpac bank customers
missed their weekly paychecks, were overpaid, or had direct debit payments taken out twice on
Thursday, July 3rd. The bank is responsible for providing payroll services to hundreds of
thousands of people. The problem was evidently caused by the transmission of an interbanking

a year before, Apple dictated that the phones be activated in the store before customers left. An
unanticipated heavy demand defeated this concept. Apple’s iTunes servers experienced
problems, preventing activation. In the U.K., network partner O2’s servers overloaded. The
Telstra mobile billing system in Australia collapsed. Customers waited for hours in long lines or

TheSinkingDataCenter
WHIR News, Monday, July 14, 2008 – Once in a while, a site disaster can be clearly predicted
and steps taken to protect the data center. A 70,000 square-foot facility in Tennessee is being
relocated bythe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers because it is slowly sinking. In addition to having
been built on an unstable landfill 21 years ago, it is also just downstream from one of the five
dams in the U.S. at most risk of failing; and it has only one power source. The site will be

QueenslandTelephoneServiceSeveredbyCableCut
news.com.au, Tuesday, July 15, 2008 - A fiber-optic cable was cut by workers laying a pipe for
Australia’s Queensland water grid, collapsing the Optus communication network for over four
hours. Communications throughout Queensland were abruptly terminated for more than a million
customers when rerouting failed. Airports, hospitals, 000 emergency calls, government services,
stockbrokers, and Internet access were all affected. Unhappily, a hardware fault had taken down
the state’s backup link the night before; so services weren’t restored until the fiber could be
repaired. Backbone networks do go down. This illustrates the need for a company seeking high
availabilitytohaveconnectivitytotwoindependentcommunicationnetworks.2
NICClosesDublin Airport
Examiner, Thursday, July 17, 2008 – Aircraft position and identification information started to
intermittently disappear from controllers’ screens in early June, 2008, as aircraft departed and
approached Dublin Airport, Ireland’s busiest air-traffic hub. The problem continued through early
July, when it finally became so bad that controllers shut down the air traffic control system on
Wednesday afternoon, July 16th, and rerouted planes to other airports. The problem was
ultimately traced to a faulty Network Interface Card (NIC) providing radar data to the control
systems. There was no backup link. Tens of thousands of passengers were left stranded or
delayedoveraseveraldayperiod.

May of 2008, a click of the Enter key destroyed the business. A lone system administrator ran a

customers. MediaMax management apologized profusely to their irate customers and then

unable to access their accounts for over a day starting at 8 AM on October 15th. The problem,
which took down not only the online bank’s Web site but also its call center, was caused by a
power failure at the bank’s Spanish facility. As a result, customers could not make transactions
either online or by telephone. Neither were any scheduled debt payments made, leaving

WegmansStoresShutDownforHoursFollowingFalseAlarm
WIVB TV, Friday, October 17, 2008 – With 71 stores in five states in the U.S., Wegmans is a
major supermarket chain with offices near Rochester, New York. On October 15th, 2008, a fire
alarm in its data center triggered the shut-down of all of its computers for over four hours. During
this time, no store could process debit or credit cards or gift certificates. However, no fire was
ever detected. Essentially shutting down all of its stores for four hours except for cash
transactions had to carry a hefty price tag for Wegmans. Where was the business continuity
plan? Reversion to manual swipe imprinters would have reduced the effect of the problem for
verylittleinvestment.

The Star, Monday, October 20, 2008 – Air Canada, Canada’s major airline, saw its computer
operations come to a halt for several hours on the morning of October 20th. The culprit was a
nationwide glitch caused by a routing problem in Bell Canada’s trans-Canadian backbone
communications network. The outage affected all of Air Canada’s online IT operations, from self-
service kiosks to sign-in desks, gate operations, ticketing, and reservations, causing massive

in the world, went down for over three days when its data-processing center in Santa Clara,
California, abruptly crashed. Outsourced to Quality Technology Services, the data center went
down when Quality Tech pulled the plug on utility power as part of normal failover testing. The
diesel generators failed to come up due to a voltage regulator problem. As a consequence, the
