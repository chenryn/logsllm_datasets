Oracle Data Replication
September2011
The key component for achieving high availability and continuous availability is data replication. It is the
replication engine that maintains a remote copy of the production database so that it is protected against
anydisasterthatmightbefalltheproductiondatabase.
Furthermore, if bidirectional replication is used, all nodes in the application network can participate in
transaction processing. Should a node fail, all that needs to be done is to route further transactions to
surviving nodes. Recovery times measured in seconds can be achieved. This is the active/active
architecture.1
By many measures, the Oracle database is the most widely used database today for critical corporate
applications. Oracle has a rich set of data replication capabilities to support a range of availabilities and
data protection. In this article, we look at these Oracle products. Theyinclude Oracle Data Guard, Oracle
GoldenGate,andOracleStreams.
A Product Summary

Their newest replication engine is GoldenGate. Oracle acquired GoldenGate Software, Inc., in 2009.
Indications are that GoldenGate is to be the preferred replication engine in the future. In fact, at Oracle
World 2010, Oracle announced that Oracle Steams will continue to be supported but not be actively
enhanced.2OracleGoldenGatewillbethefutureforOraclereplication.
The one capability that GoldenGate does not possess is synchronous replication. This need is filled by
Oracle Data Guard. Oracle Data Guard can also provide replication between RAC (Real Application
Cluster)clusterswithautomatedswitchoverintheeventofaproduction-nodefailure.3

GoldenGate grew up in the HP NonStop world, where it was heavily used for data replication. Its
bidirectional capabilities are used in many NonStop active/active applications. However, it seems that
Oracleis turningits back ontheNonStopcommunitybasedonthesignificant licensefeeincreases that it
is exacting from current NonStop customers. Many of these customers are migrating to other NonStop
replication engines such as Shadowbase from Gravic, Inc., (www.gravic.com/shadowbase) and DRNet
fromNetworkTechnologiesInternational(http://network-tech.com/drnet.html).
Oracle Data Guard
OracleDataGuard provides asynchronous or synchronous replicationservices to createandmanageone
ormorestandbydatabasesthatarecopiesofaproductiondatabase.4
Architecture
The Oracle database maintains a redo log that records every change made to the production database.
DataGuard accomplishes data replicationbyshipping the productionredo logto eachstandbydatabase.
At each standbydatabase, Oracle applies the redo data to keep the standbydatabase synchronized with
theproductiondatabase.
Data Guard supports heterogeneous configurations. A standby database may be the same as the
production database. In this case, redo changes are applied with Oracle’s Redo Apply facility. On the
otherhand,thestandbydatabasesmaybedifferent.Inthiscase,SQLApplyisusedtotransformthedata
in the redo log to standard SQL statements and then to execute these statements on the standby
database.
Configuration

copies of the production database. As such, they can support many functions such as query, reporting,
and backups. Furthermore, Data Guard can switch any standby database to production use to recover
fromaprimarydatabasefailure.
The databases in a Data Guard configuration may be dispersed geographically so long as they can
communicate with each other. This is important for disaster recovery and can be useful to position
databasecopiesclosetocommunitiesofusers.

The primary and standby databases may each be managed by their own dedicated server, or they may
eachbedatabasesinaRAC(RealApplicationCluster).
If Data Guard should detect that a redo log on a standby system is corrupt, it will refresh that redo log
fromtheproductiondatabaseorthatofanotherstandbysystem,ifthereisone.
RoleTransitions
The production and standby roles of the databases in the network can be interchanged either via a
switchover or a failover. A switchover is a controlled change of roles, usually done for planned
maintenance.Switchoverisdonewithnodataloss.
A failover occurs following a catastrophic failure of the production database. One of the standby
databases is configured to become the production database in the event of such a failure. In this case,
somedatathathasnotyetbeenreplicatedmaybelost.
Should a standby database fail, the production database will queue further redo log blocks until the
standbydatabaseisreturnedtoservice.Atthattime,theproductiondatabasewilldrainitsredologqueue
tobringthestandbydatabasebackintosynchronization.
Role transitions are commanded manually. However, they can be simplified or automated using Oracle’s
DataGuardBroker.
DataGuardBroker
The Data Guard Broker is a distributed management facility that automates the creation, maintenance,
and monitoring of a Data Guard configuration. It can be used via a command line interface or via a GUI
interfaceprovidedbyOracleEnterpriseManager.
DataGuardProtectionModes
Data Guard provides three protection modes that offer various compromises between failure recovery
timeanddatalossfollowingafailureaswellasperformanceduringnormaloperation.
MaximumProtectionMode
The maximum protection mode ensures that no data will be lost following a production node failure. This
mode uses synchronous replication. A transaction on the production system cannot complete until the
redologneededtorecoverthattransactionhasbeenwrittentoatleastonestandbysystem.
If replication should fail for any reason, the production system is shut down until the problem can be
corrected. This prevents a subsequent failure in the production system from causing the loss of data that
hasnotbeenreplicated.
MaximumAvailabilityMode
Themaximumavailabilitymodeissimilartothemaximumprotectionmodeinthatsynchronousreplication
is used to keep the standby databases in synchronism with the production database. However, in this
mode, the production system will continue to operate in the maximum performance mode described next
if replication should fail. When replication is resumed, the redo log blocks that have not yet been
replicated will be sent to the standby databases. When this change queue has been drained,
synchronousreplicationresumes.

In this mode, no data loss will occur if replication fails. However, if the production system should fail

ofthereplicationchannelfollowedbyafailureoftheproductionsystem.
MaximumPerformanceMode
Both the maximum protection mode and the maximum availability mode impose a performance penalty
on the applications using the database. This is because each transaction is delayed until at least one
standbyhasreceivedalloftheredologblockscontaininganoperationforthattransaction.
The maximum performance mode corrects this performance problem by using asynchronous replication.
A transaction will commit on the production system immediately without waiting for a standby system.
However, data loss following a production system failure is now possible. Any redo log entries that have
notbeenreplicatedwillbelost.
OtherFeatures
Replication can be delayed by a specified time interval. This gives some protection against user errors
which may erroneously modify or delete data. Alternatively, Data Guard’s Flashback Database feature
lets a database be restored to some previous point in time from the redo log without having to restore a
backupandthenrolltransactionsforwardtothetimeoftheerror.
Because database synchronization is performed by replicating the redo log rather than actual database
changes, corruption to the production database does not replicate to the standby databases. This is true
solongastheredologisnotcorrupted.
Oracle GoldenGate
TheGoldenGatereplication engine provides asynchronous replicationbetweenheterogeneous platforms,
including Oracle.5 Furthermore, GoldenGate provides bidirectional replication supporting active/active
configurations.
Architecture
The architecture of the GoldenGate replication engine is similar in many respects to Data Guard.
GoldenGate follows a queue of changes made to the source database and sends them to the target
databaseforapplyingtothetargetdatabase.

GoldenGate provides the data transformation between the source and target databases to support
heterogeneity, whether it be simplydifferent data structures in otherwise identical databases or database
systemsfromdifferentvendors.
A Capture process receives changes to the source database. These changes could come from a variety
of sources. They might be extracted from a transaction log (such as Oracle’s redo log or the NonStop
TMF audit trail) maintained bythe source database or transaction manager. If such a log is not available,
changes may be fed to the Capture process directly by the application or by an intercept library
embeddedintheapplication;ortheymaybefedbychangeinformationgeneratedbydatabasetriggers.
Data changes captured by the Capture process are written to the source-side Trail File, which provides a
queue of transactions to be sent to the target system.Theremayalso be a target system Trail File which
will queue changes prior to applying them to the target database. The Trail Files function as consistent
en-route checkpoints for the data replication process so that replication can be continued without data
