# Human Error Caused OWASA Fluoride Overdose, OWASA Very Sorry About That

An \"unintentional \[water treatment plant\] operator key
stroke\"---literally, someone hit the wrong button---caused the overfeed
of fluoride that forced OWASA to shut down its water plant last week,
according to independent reports released Friday.\
\
The extra fluoride dosage, plus a major water main break the next day,
prompted a water shortage in Orange County that closed businesses,
placed Chapel Hill and Carrboro under states of emergency, and sent
residents scrambling to buy bottled water. Customers were [unable to use
or drink their water for more than twenty-four
hours.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210226170650/http://www.indyweek.com/news/archives/2017/02/04/owasa-water-is-safe-again)\
\
This afternoon, OWASA released reports on both the February 2 [fluoride
overfeed](https://web.archive.org/web/20210226170650/http://www.owasa.org/Data/Sites/1/media/2017wateremergency/final_primary-and-contributing-causes-of-loss-of-function-of-the-jones-ferry-wtp_10feb17.pdf)
and the February 3 [water main
break.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210226170650/http://www.owasa.org/Data/Sites/1/media/2017wateremergency/owasa_main_break_tm.pdf)\
\
According to the fluoride report, by CH2M HILL North Carolina, at 11:43
a.m. on February 2, a plant operator accidentally instructed the
plant\'s fluoride feed pump to increase its feed rate to 80 percent,
compared with its normal operating range of about 8--12 percent. The
operator tried to change the command about twelve seconds later, but
according to the report, the change didn\'t register.\
\
\"The pump appears to have operated at a rate significantly greater than
the subsequent commanded speed for approximately 3.25 hours, resulting
in a fluoride overfeed condition,\" the report says.\
\
A lead operator at the plant noticed the extra high levels \"but did not
take corrective action, leading to the issue not being resolved until
after 2:40 p.m.\"\
\
A fluoride level of 5.90 mg/L was recorded at the plant that day,
exceeding state and federal primary drinking water standards by 1.9
mg/L, the report says. (Fluoride is added to water to prevent tooth
decay.)\
\
The water main break, according to a report by AECOM Technical Services,
may have been the result of the pipe bending because of pressure and
settling. The pipe that broke, near the intersection of Summerfield
Crossing Road and Foxcroft Drive, was buried three feet below the
street.\
\
\"An increase in water pressure or an increase in external forces may
have been responsible for the failure event. As the pipe is shallow, it
would have been very sensitive to live loads---more so with an increased
point load effect over the storm sewer below; so any combination of
increased pressure, differential settling, or increased external loading
(or increase in bending moment in this case) may\
have initiated the failure,\" the report says.\
\
The break leaked about 1.2 million gallons of water, causing pressure in
the system to plummet. As a result, customers were ordered not to use or
drink their water because low flow can allow bacteria to grow in pipes.
[Tests show the water was not contaminated.\

The OWASA board of directors met Thursday night to discuss the water
shortage and hear comments from the public and staff. Another meeting
will be held February 23 at 7 p.m. in the Chapel Hill Town Hall.\
\
"Last night, the Board agreed that OWASA would develop solutions to
prevent the particular failures of last week, assess outage risks more
broadly and take action to improve the water system resiliency, and
review communication practices of OWASA and its partners during critical
events. We may turn again to outside parties for both expertise and
objectivity,\" John Young, chair of the OWASA Board of Directors, said
in a statement. \"OWASA apologizes for the significant disruptions and
impact experienced by the community and thanks its many partners for
their support."\
\
OWASA [says it has stopped adding fluoride to the
water,](https://web.archive.org/web/20210226170650/http://owasa.org/faqs)
and [*The News & Observer*
reports](https://web.archive.org/web/20210226170650/http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/community/chapel-hill-news/article131922419.html)
that the agency is reviewing its policies and seeking public input
before reintroducing it to the water supply.\
