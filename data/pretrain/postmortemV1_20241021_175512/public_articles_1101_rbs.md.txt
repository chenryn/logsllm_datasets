RBS – A Poster Child for Outages
January2016
The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and its associated banks, NatWest and Ulster Bank,
have a sorry record for customer service. Over just the last three and a half years, the
banks have suffered a half dozen outages, each depriving the banks’ customers online access to their
accounts, the use of their payment cards, and the immobilization of their mobile applications. Despite
promisestoupgradetheiraginglegacyITenvironments,theservicefailurescontinue.
RBS’ problems are not unique to them. Many banks throughout the world face the same problems.
Established banks built their banking IT systems decades ago. They were implemented by a myriad of
different software teams writing in different languages on different machines in different locations. The
developersmovedon.Documentationwaseitherlostorwasnonexistent.
Many of the languages used in the legacy banking applications are no longer used, resulting in a lack of
skills to maintain the applications. The technologies available today to integrate applications did not exist
decades ago, and the applications are often relegated to their own silos, unable to interoperate with
newerapplications.
The ongoing rash of banking mergers and acquisitions further aggravate the problem, requiring the
integration of disparate banking applications. Add to this the demand by increasingly tech-savvy
customers who want to bank online and via their mobile apps. These capabilities require new systems

systemsmakes it stand out as a primaryexample of the problems inherent in trying to maintain these old
legacysystems.

A History of Frequent Outages

customers.

June2012–DownforTwoWeeks
Perhaps the worstoutageoccurredonJune19,2012. TheIT systemsof RBS,NatWest,andUlster Bank
all came to a halt. Millions of customers were affected. Theycould not pay bills. Theycould not use their

Being plagued with the loss of online services for such a long time, the problems spilled over to other

Over the weekend of June 16 and 17, 2012, the Group upgraded its batch management facility. On
Monday, June 18th, one of the batch runs failed. Consequently, on Tuesday, June 19th, the upgrade was
backedout.
Unfortunately, the remaining batch jobs could not be run until the failed batch run was corrected.
However, this required determining where the batch run had failed, as millions of transactions had been
processed correctly up to the failure and should not be processed again. However, the operations staff
could not determine at which transaction the batch run had failed. It took until Friday to determine the
failure point and the cause of the failure so that the batch run could continue. It turned out that a critical
schedulingfilehadbeenerroneouslydeleted.
Bythis time,several days of batchruns hadaccumulated andhadtobe executed.It took several days to

To aid its customers, the Group expanded its call center and opened bank branches on Sundays. It
agreed to compensate its customers for anycosts they incurred as a result of the outage. In the end, the
two-weekoutagecosttheGroup£175million.
March2013–AHardwareFault
In March, 2013, a hardware fault in one of their systems caused a six-hour outage during which

As a cost-cutting measure, the Group began to outsource its IT management overseas to India. This

On December 2nd, one of the busiest shopping days of the year – Cyber Monday (the Monday after the
U.S. Thanksgiving holiday), the Group lost all of its online services. Customers could not access the

The Group announced that the problem was not volume or hacking. It was a problem with the integration

This was the third major outage in eighteen months. The Group Chief Executive, Ross McEwan, called
the outages unacceptable. He admitted that “for decades, RBS failed to invest properly in its systems….
We are investing heavily in building IT systems our customers can rely on.” He noted that RBS had
preferred to struggle with its aging infrastructure. He pledged to spend £700 million over the next three
yearstoimprovethebank’ssystems.

June2015–LostTransactions
On Tuesday, June 16, 2015, CEO McEwan stated that he wants RBS to be the number one bank for
customer service in the UK by 2020. As a stroke of bad timing, RBS lost 600,000 transactions the next
day. Bills were not paid on time. Accounts were not credited with deposits. Checks were returned.
Customerscouldnotwithdrawcashfromtheiraccounts.

December2015–LostAccounts
In December, about 4,500 RBS customers with inactive accounts were told that the bank did not have
these accounts and was not holding their funds. Customers had located these accounts through a
national lost-account service that helped savers who wanted to trace savings that had been lying
dormant.
The problem was caused by incorrect filters on computer software that was supposed to identify holders
ofinactiveaccounts.
RBS sent letters of apology to the affected customers, informing them to reclaim their outstanding
balancesbyvisitingtheirlocalbankbranches.

Millions of RBS customers could not use their payment cards because the POS (point-of-sale) terminal

RBS Penalties
The UK banking authorities have penalized RBS extensively for the problems that it has had with its
legacy banking systems. In 2014, RBS was fined £56 million for software problems that prevented
customersofallthreeoftheGroup’sbanksfromaccessingtheiraccounts.
In 2015, the UK Financial Conduct Authorityfined RBS £42 million, and the Bank of England’s Prudential

Lessons Learned
Aging banking systems are not limited to RBS. Banks across the global banking sector face this
challenge. In mid-January, UK bank HSBC had a two-day outage that denied online access to millions of
itscustomers.ThisoutagecamejustsixmonthsafterapreviousmajorHSBCoutage.
Not onlyare the old legacy systems difficult to maintain with their archaic software languages and lack of
documentation, but it is extremely difficult and risky to add modern-day functionality to them such as
online banking and mobile apps. These new capabilities are typically added by building them into new,
modernsystemsthatthen mustbeintegratedwiththelegacysystems.However,byandlarge,thelegacy
systems were implemented in a day when system integration facilities did not exist. Thus, the integration

One major advantage that the newer banks have is that theycan be more facile at mining Big Data – the
mass of data that a bank accumulates on its customers’ behaviors. This can provide a bank with
important tools to design new services that will attract and keep customers. The legacy systems of
establishedbanksdonotfitwellintothisparadigm.
In December, 2013, RBS CEO McEwan promised spend £700 million over the next three years to
improve the bank’s systems. Two years have now past. Let us see if he can meet his commitment this
timenextyear.
