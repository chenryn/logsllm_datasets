Vodafone Downed by Burglars
April2011
We can imagine many disasters that can take down a data center – floods, fires, earthquakes,
explosions. But what about theft of equipment? That is what happened to a Vodafone telephone
exchangelateonenight.
Vodafone
Vodafoneistheworld’slargestmobiletelecommunicationscarrierintheworldas
measuredbyrevenues.ComingbehindonlyChina Mobil,it is thesecondlargest
carrier as measured by subscribers, with over 300 million customers.
Headquartered in the UK, Vodafone provides services directly in over 30
countries and through partners in over 40 additional countries. It owns 45% of
Verizon,thelargestmobiletelecommunicationscompanyintheUnitedStates.
The Break-In
Shortly after midnight on Sunday, February 28, 2011, a
large swath of Vodafone customers in southern England
suddenly found themselves without mobile services.
Voice, texting, and mobile Internet services had all
disappeared. Subscribers from Oxford in the north to
Salisburyinthesouthwereimpacted.
It seems that thieves had used sledgehammers to break
into a major Vodafone mobile hub in Basingstoke and
had made off with racks of computers and networking
equipment. The hub connected mobile users throughout
southernEnglandwiththeVodafonecellularnetwork.
The stolen equipment is reported to have been worth
several million pounds. It was the network gear that
recognized mobile phone SIM cards and connected the
phones to the mobile network. Without this capability,
no cell phone service could be provided to Vodafone
customers.Thenetworkwasdead.
The telephone exchange is in a nondescript building
that sits on an anonymous site in an industrial park.

It evidently took Vodafone a while to determine what had happened. The police arrived on the
scene about 5 AM and began their investigation while Vodafone scrambled to restore service.
Vodafone was able to restore voice service in the late morning, eleven hours after the outage
began.TextandInternetserviceswerenotrestoreduntilmid-afternoon.
Vodafone stated that several hundred thousand customers were affected. Other reports put the
tallyatthreetosevenmillioncustomers.Vodafonehas19millioncustomersinEngland.
The Motive
The motive for the theft may never be known if the perpetrators are not apprehended. However,
the general consensus is that the equipment is destined for Eastern Europe where there is a
thriving black market in IT equipment. The thieves took very specialized telecommunications
equipment–theyseemedtoknowwhattheywanted.
Other theories are that the thieves were looking for copper. Thefts of copper cables occur
regularlyascopperfetches agoodpriceontheblack market.However,cables wereleftrelatively
intact.
Another thought was that the thieves wrongly believed that the computers held personal account
details that might be useful for ID fraud. If the theft had included Home Location Register
computers,thiswouldhavebeenaproblem.However,Vodafoneassureditscustomersthatthere
werenosecurityrisksinthetheft.
Keeping Customers Informed
Losing mobile service for the better part of a daywas bad enough for Vodafone’s customers. But
based on blog postings and tweets, what really aggravated its customer base was the lack of
communications. No one knew what was happening, nor did they have any indication of when
servicewouldberestored.
Reportedly, the first post that Vodafone made to its web site
relative to the outage was not until almost noontime on Monday,
almosttwelvehoursaftertheoutagebegan.Vodafonesaid:
“We hada break in last night at one of our technical
facilitieswhich resulted in damage done to some of our
equipment. This means thatsomecustomers may be
experiencing temporaryloss of voice, SMS, and Internet
services.We are working quickly to restore these and will be
back tonormal as soon as we can. There has been no impact
ontheprivacyofcustomers’data.“
Meantime, an internal Vodafone memo was widely circulated on
the Internet. It told much more than Vodafone’s formal posting.

Lessons Learned
Mobile phone service is no longer just a convenience to keep in touch with family members and
friends. It has become critical to the operation of many businesses. Many of the Internet posts
complaining about the outage came from professionals who could not conduct their normal,
everydaybusinessactivitiesbecauseoftheoutage.
Not being able to communicate for most of the dayis bad enough. But what seemed to reallyget
people angry was the lack of communication from Vodafone. Customers did not know what was
happening nor when to expect the restoration of mobile services. We have seen this in so many
Never Again stories – a total lack of communication with the affected users. In response, many
companies now post digital dashboards showing the status of their services and details on
problems.Vodafoneshoulddefinitelyfollowsuit.

Other aspects of this incident also stand out. Where was the physical security for the building?
Was there a guard on site? Was the site alarmed? Why did it take the police so long to arrive at
thescene?
Furthermore, telephone networks are so reliable because they can automatically route around
failures. If an exchange goes down, traffic is simply routed around it to other exchanges. Why
couldVodafonenotdothis?
And where was Vodafone’s business continuity plan? Surely, they had considered the recovery
fromadata-centerfailure.Orhadthey?
Speaking of business continuity plans, one final point is to be made. There were hundreds if not
thousands of posted complaints from business people who could not conduct their normal
business during the outage. Where were their business continuity plans? If you depend upon
infrastructure such as telephone systems or the Internet, you must know that these systems are
not100%reliable.Theywillfail.Whatisyourplantocontinueyourbusinessactivitiesintheevent
