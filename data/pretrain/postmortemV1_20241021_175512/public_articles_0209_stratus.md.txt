Fault-Tolerant Windows and Linux from Stratus
September2007
Introduction
ftServers from Stratus Technologies (www.stratus.com) provide plug-and-
play fault tolerance for Windows and Red Hat Linux applications. Using Intel
Xeon chips in a dual modular redundancy architecture, ftServers bring
extremely high availability – five 9s and beyond – to the industry standard
marketplaceataffordableprices.
In contrast, average annual unplanned downtime for industry-standard servers has been
measured to be about thirteen hours for Windows systems, sixteen hours for Red Hat Linux
systems,andtenhoursfor UNIXsystems.TheavailabilityofftServers iscontinuallymonitoredby
Stratus, and a running availability is posted on its home page. This Uptime Meter indicates an
average availability for the Stratus hardware and operating systems of greater than five 9s, or
abouttwominutesper yearofdowntime.
Stratus’ftServer supports Windows,Linux, and Stratus’proprietaryoperatingsystem,VOS.Their

The Stratus ftServer Platform
The high availability achieved by the Stratus ftServer product line is achieved by running all
applications on dual processors that are lockstepped at the memory access level. Should there
be a disagreement between the processors, one of the processors has suffered a fault. If the
faulty processor has detected its own fault, that processor is
taken out of service. Otherwise, processing is paused as
eachprocessor enters aself-testmode;andtheprocessor in
error is taken out of service. Processing continues with the
remaininggoodprocessor.1
The faulty processor can be replaced and synchronized with

TheProcessors
An ftServer comprises two logical processors. Each logical processor is packaged as a 2U
module, similar to a blade, which Stratus calls a slice. The logical processors are interconnected
viaasmall,passivebackplane.AcompletestandaloneftServer,therefore,hasa4Uformfactor.
The ftServer logical processors use the Intel Xeon multicore microprocessors. A range of
processing power is provided across the ftServer product line, from single dual-core logical

I/OSubsystem
Each 2U module, or slice, contains its own I/O subsystem. Each I/O subsystem also has it own
fault detection and isolation logic. In normal operation, peripheral devices are driven by both I/O
subsystems via a multi-path connection. However, if an I/O subsystem detects a malfunction, it
willremoveitselffromservice.
Each logical processor is connected to each of the I/O subsystems. In this way, any combination
of one logical processor failure and one I/O subsystem failure will not render the system
inoperable.
IntegratedDisks
Each slice contains not only its logical microprocessor cores, memory, and I/O subsystem but
also three 500 gigabyte integrated disks. Thus, each logical processor has direct access to 1.5
terabytes of local storage. This storage is mirrored between the slices, providing fault-tolerant
storagewithintheftServeritself.
OperatingSystems
The Windows and Red Hat Linux operating systems that Stratus supports are those that are
commercially available to anyone. Therefore, the ftServers are application binary interface (ABI)
compatible withWindows and Linux applications. Any application that can run under Windows or
Red Hat Linux on an industry-standard server can run on an ftServer without modification. The
installationandadministrationprocedures areidentical.Theusershouldseenodifferenceexcept
fordowntime–andthatisthebigdifference.
Behind the scenes, Stratus spends a great deal of effort ensuring that these operating systems
measureuptoitshigh-availabilityrequirements.Workingwithitspartners,MicrosoftandRedHat,
Stratus works diligently to harden the operating systems so that operating system faults are
minimized.
When a new operating system version is about to be released, Stratus engineers do everything
that they can to break it and the drivers that are supplied with it by the peripheral vendors. They
2

use a facility they call “Breaker” to induce a wide variety of faults, from device errors to power
glitches. The Stratus engineers claim that they have not yet found a device driver that theycould
not break. Faults that involve the operating system are reported back to Microsoft and Red Hat,
who make corrections to eliminate the sources of those failures. Actually, everyone benefits from
this effort because it is the hardened version that is released for public use. The Windows and
Red Hat Linux operating systems that Stratus runs are the standard commercially available
versions.
However, Stratus has found that the weak links in the software systems are the device drivers.
Therefore, Stratus develops its own hardened device drivers that will stand up to the stresses
generated by Breaker. As a consequence, Stratus will only support certain peripheral devices.
This limits the choice of peripherals such as external disk arrays and network interfaces. Since
the operating systems are standard, anyone can install any device driver that they want.

HardwareFaultDetectionandIsolation
In normal operation, both logical processors are processing the same instruction stream and are
comparingtheir results at a memory-access levelas theyproceed. Providingthattheyagree,it is
knownthattheyarecorrect;andtheycontinueon.
Thereareseveralprocessorfailuremodes:
 One failure mode occurs when one of the processors, through its own fault-detection
logic, recognizes that its operation is erroneous. In this case, it takes itself out of service,
and the other processor carries on with normal processing. This “fast-fail” action ensures
that the faulty processor will not propagate the error to external interfaces or to the
database.
However, it is possible that this error was a transient error. Therefore, the failed
processor will run a self-check diagnostic. If it passes the diagnostic, it returns itself to
service and is resynchronized with the operational processor so that fault tolerance is
restored. A count is kept of transient errors for each logical processor. Should this count
exceedaspecifiedlimit,theprocessoristakenoutofserviceandmustbereplaced.
 A second failure mode occurs when the two logical processors disagree, but neither has
declared itself at fault. In this case, processing is paused; and the two logical processors
each run their self-test diagnostic. If one should determine that it is indeed at fault, it is
takenoutofservice(sincethefaultwasdetectable,itwasnotatransientfault).
 Athirdfailuremodeoccurswhenthetwologicalprocessorsdisagree,andbothpasstheir
self-diagnostic tests. In this case, the problem is likely to be a timing problem, such as
two simultaneous interrupts being processed in different order. One logical processor is
declared the winner, and the other is resynchronized with it. Operation in fault-tolerant
modecontinues.
In any case, fault-tolerant operation continues on as long as there are two good logical
processors. Should one processor fail, the system continues on as a single nonfault-tolerant
systemuntilthefailedprocessorisreplaced.

When a replacement logical processor is available, it is slid into the 2U slice slot to replace the
failedprocessor.Itsmemoryandinternaldisk-residentdatabasearethenresynchronizedwiththe
operating processor while system operation continues, after which the new processor is put into
service.Fault-tolerantoperationisnowrestored.
Resynchronization impacts system performance only to a small degree. At the end of the
synchronization process, there is about a 100 millisecond pause as the new logical processor is
putintoservice.
OperatingSystemFaultRecovery
Even with the extensive efforts to harden the operating system, the operating system will crash
onoccasion.Thiswill,ofcourse,takedowntheftServer;anditmustberebooted.
When this happens with an industry-standard server, it is good practice to obtain a dump of the
operating system so that the fault can be tracked down and corrected. However, this is a timely
processduringwhichthesystemcontinuestobedown.
Stratus makes use of its dual processors to alleviate this problem. Following a crash, only one of
the logical processors is rebooted and becomes operational. The other is used to perform the
dump. When the dump is finished, the processor will join the operating processor, restoring fault
tolerancetotheftServer.

Storage Arrays
To augment the 1.5 terabyte mirrored internal storage, Stratus offers its ftScalable storage array.
This array has a 2U form factor and includes dual RAID controllers with redundant cache. Each
ftScalable array contains twelve 300 gb disks, yielding a capacity of 3.6 terabytes. Up to three

Virtualization
Virtualization technology allows many virtual machines to run on a single server. Virtualization is
animportanttechniqueforgettingfullutilizationoutoflargeserverfarms.
A problem faced with virtualization technology is that availability becomes far more important.
One particular application may not have a high value and can suffer some downtime without
serious consequence. However, run many of these as virtual machines on a single server, and a
serverfailurebecomesmuchmorecostly.

Stratus is integrating the ftServer with VMware’s ESX
Server to allow ftServers to host many virtual Windows
Apps Apps Apps Apps
and Linux machines in any combination. The ESX
Server sits on top of the ftServer hardware and
supports multiple instances of different operating

systems running as if they were in their own physical
server.

The Stratus Continuum Family
The Continuum product line is an older line that is still marketed and supported by Stratus. It is
based on PA-RISC microprocessors. The PA-RISC chips are no longer made by HP, but Stratus
states that it has an extensive inventory of these chips that will allow it to support the Continuum
seriesintotheforeseeablefuture.

Rolling Upgrades
The Stratus ActiveUpgrade facility allows Windows updates to be installed without taking down
the system. To do this, one of the logical processors is taken offline; and its operating system is
updated.Itisthenputonline,andtheapplicationsarerestartedinordertobecompatiblewiththe

Stratus has not made this facility available for VOS, as VOS is now very stable with few
upgrades. They also have not made it available for Linux as theyfeel that virtualization will make
thisunnecessary.
Stratus Call Home
All Stratus servers monitor themselves for faults. If a problem of anykind is detected, the system
will automatically call a Stratus support facility (provided customer permission has been granted
todoso);andactionisimmediatelytakentodiagnosetheproblem.
If it is decided that a component needs to be replaced, Stratus will immediately send the
component to the customer’s site. There are many cases in which the first sign of a problem to

The Stratus Uptime Meters
The success of all of the availability features described above is reflected in the Stratus Uptime
Meters, one for ftServers and one for Continuum servers. The ftServer meter is updated daily,
whereas the Continuum meter is updated weekly. The meters are accessible from Stratus’ home
page(theftServerUptimeMeterisshownthere).
Calculatedavailabilityis basedon allreportedservice incidents
over the preceding six-month period that impacted production.
Both hardware-related and Stratus-supplied software-related

Market Positioning
Stratus’mantraisavailability,simplicity,andcost:
 Availability-ftServersachieveavailabilitiesoffive9sandbeyond.
 Simplicity- The ftServers are plug-and-play. They are installed and are administered just
likeanyotherindustry-standardserver.
 Cost-Serverprices,rangingfromthelow- tomid-fivefigures,areaffordable.
Stratus focuses on the industry-standard server community by offering fault-tolerant systems that
canreplacenormalindustry-standardservers.
What about the other fault-tolerant systems – HP NonStop servers? Both HP and Stratus
marketing people say that they rarely run into each other. Stratus focuses on the low-end
industry-standard server market, and the HP NonStop folks focus on the very large systems
requiring massive scalability, a feature Stratus does not support. They each say that if they run
intoeachother,probablyoneofthemisinthewrongplace.
Nevertheless, the low end is pervasive. Stratus is found in eight of the top ten banks, 12 of the
top 15 pharmaceuticals, fourteen of the top twenty telecommunication companies, and in over
225publicagencies.
Stratus – the Phoenix Risen from the Ashes
Stratus Computers was founded in 1980 by Bill Foster. It became a publicly held company but
was then acquired by Ascend in 1998 for Stratus’ telecommunication products. Shortly after that,

The new Stratus Technologies now has over 5,000 customers in 47 countries. Its 700+
employees generate over a quarter billion dollars in revenue. Stratus, like the Phoenix, has come
fullcirclefrombirthtodisappearancetorebirth.
Summary
Stratus today is the predominant player in the fault-tolerant, industry-standard server
marketplace. With its lockstep hardware technology, its hardened failsafe software, and its call-
home and availability services, it provides affordable, plug-and-play fault-tolerant solutions for
Windows, Red Hat Linux, VOS, and HP-UX systems. Via its port of VMware, it is now entering
thefault-tolerantservermarketforvirtualizeddatacenters.
It is a tribute to the short-sightedness of today’s IT managers that fault-tolerant solutions such as
