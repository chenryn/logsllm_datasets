Fire Suppression Suppresses WestHost for Days
May2010
It’s not a good idea to test a fire-suppression system bytriggering it. But that’s what happened to
WestHost,amajor web-hostingprovider headquarteredinUtah.Theaccidentalreleaseof ablast

Inergen
The WestHost fire-suppression system works by releasing Inergen gas. Comprising common
atmospheric gases, Inergen is environmentally friendly and breathable by people; but it reduces
theoxygencontentofairtoalevelthatdoesnotsupportcombustion.
Inergen comprises 52% nitrogen, 40% argon, and 8% carbon. Normal air is 21% oxygen and
79% nitrogen with traces of carbon dioxide and other gases. Enough Inergen in a fire-
suppression system is released to create a 40% to 50% concentration in the computer room’s
normal air supply. This reduces the oxygen content in the computer room to about 10% to 12%,
which is not enough to support combustion (about a 15% oxygen concentration is required for
combustion).
However,the increasedcarbon dioxide level inInergen increases a person’s respiration rate(it is
carbon dioxide in our blood stream that invokes the breathing response), allowing a person to
function in the reduced oxygen level Therefore, Inergen is safe for humans, although theyshould
beevacuatedasquicklyaspossible.
In the event of a fire, Inergen is released rapidly and causes a large pressure surge that must be
relievedquicklytopreventdamagetotheenclosedspace.
The Meltdown
On Saturday, February 20, 2010, the WestHost data center underwent a standard yearly test of
its Inergen fire-suppression system. Unfortunately, a third-partytest technician failed to follow the
publishedpre-testcheck listanddidnotremoveoneoftheactuatorsthatactivates thesystem.At
about2:20PMlocaltime,whenthesystemwasre-armedfollowingthetest,theactuatorfiredand
triggeredthereleaseofthelargeblastofInergengasdesignedtoputafireout.
No one seems to know for sure whether it was the pressure blast or the gas itself, but hundreds
of servers and disk storage systems were severely damaged. WestHost operations immediately
cametoahalt,anditwasdaysbeforefullservicewasrestored.
WestHost’sfirstchallenge was togetthefailedservers back intooperation. However,manywere
soseverelydamagedthattheyrequiredthereplacementofhardwarecomponents.Someservers
could be repaired with onsite spares. Others had to wait for spares to be delivered from
WestHost’s suppliers via expedited delivery. Despite this Herculean effort, WestHost reported
Mondayafternoon(50hourslater)thateighteenservershadyettobereturnedtoservice.
But this was only the beginning of the recovery effort. The repaired servers had to have their
databases restored, a task thatWestHost predicted would take another four days to complete. In
apostedannouncement,WestHostexplained:
“At present, we have restored service to all but twelve shared and six dedicated servers. …
Retrieving lost data and restoring from backups can take up to 24 hours per server. This is
where we are with the majority of downed servers. Our backup process restores three
serverssimultaneously.”
The next problem then presented its ugly head. The backup drives were in the same facility as
theservers,andmanyof thebackupdisks were destroyed.SomeRAIDdrives wererecoverable,
and their servers were brought back into service. For others, data recovery experts were brought
in and were able to restore data from failed drives. However, some data was simply deemed
nonrecoverablebythedata-restorationexperts.

Even after servers and their databases were restored, WestHost reported that some were still
experiencingfile-systemproblemsthatresultedinpoorperformance.
The end result of all these efforts was that many shared and hosted services were down for as
longassixdays.
Keeping Customers Informed
Information concerning the outage and the recovery effort was slow in coming out of WestHost.
Its ability to keep its customers informed did not get rave reviews, though this may be
understandable due to the massiveness of the outage. Not only was WestHost swamped with
customer queries, but its people were consumed by the efforts to get the data center back in
business. The only source of information for many of WestHost’s customers was what was
postedonitsNetstatuspageathttp://netstatus.westhost.co\m.
One important move that WestHost did make was to bring up some server capacity that its
customers could use for temporary purposes. This capacity could be used to provide email
services since the downed servers had taken email systems with them. It could also be used to
communicate with customers to keep them informed about the outage. WestHost patched DNS

WestHost said that it would also compensate its customers with one or more free months of
service(thecostforbusinesssharedservicesrangesupwardsfrom$12.95permonth).
Lessons Learned
Thefirstquestiontoaskishowafire-suppressionsystemcoulddestroysomuchequipment?The
answer to this is still pending. If a fire-suppression system is going to cause this much damage,
whyhaveone?(Insurancecosts,perhaps.)
Given that, what lessons can be learned from WestHost’s experience? The blogs are full of good
observationsabouttheimpactofthisdisastrousoutageandwhatpeopleshouldthinkaboutinthe
future.
 Don’t depend upon data centers, even those with advanced certifications, to protect your
services and data. Even their SLAs are clear that there is no protection. The degree of
protection that they provide is more of a marketing statement than it is a factual
guarantee.Dataprotectionandservicecontinuityareyourresponsibilities.
 Always back up your data offsite. WestHost was faulted for not having offsite data
backup. Even if a data center does provide offsite backup, there is no guarantee that the
backup data will be accessible if there is a major disaster such as experienced by
WestHost. You should back up data on an independent hosting service, an independent
backupservice,oronyourownservers(yourownPCifyouareablogger).
 If your web site is critical (such as for an online store), be prepared to bring it up
temporarily on another hosting service or on your own servers should your primary
hosting service go down. This requires that your data can be restored. You will lose any
data from the time of your last backup. Real-time replication of your data to an
independent storage facility will minimize your lost transactions. You can easilyswitch all
webtrafficfrom your primarysiteto your backupsitebysimplychangingtheDNS pointer
inyourlocalDNSserver.

 Obtain domain registration from a service other than the hosting service you are using.
Otherwise, the failure of the DNS server maintained by your primaryhosting service may
meanthatyoucannotswitchtraffictoatemporarybackupwebsite.
 Your email should not be provided by the same hosting service as the one that hosts
your web site. It is bad enough that you lose your web site. If you also lose your email,
youarereallydown.
 Communicate with your customers tokeep them informed as to what is going on. Even if
youdon’tplantoprovideafullbackupof your website,youcanprovideatemporaryweb
site to post information to your customers concerning an outage if your primary web site
isunavailable.Ifyouhavethiscapability,allyouhavetodoistoswitchyourDNSentryto

The bottom line is that you are the only one ultimately responsible for your web services. It
