The State of Virginia – Down for Days
October2010
The Commonwealth of Virginia lost dozens of its computer systems for over a week, bringing the
activities of over two dozen of its agencies to a halt. Tens of thousands of the state’s citizens
wereaffected,someseriously.ThewebsiteoftheDivisionofEmergencyManagementwentdark
justasHurricaneEarlwasapproaching.
How could so many major systems go down simultaneously? Why did it take so long to restore
services?Welookatthisfiascointhisarticle.
The Outsourcing Decision
The storybegan in 2002 when then-Governor Mark Warner commissioned a legislative review of
Virginia’s computer systems. The review concluded that the state’s computer systems were
outdatedandwerebecomingincreasinglyexpensivetomaintain.
Competitive bids were solicited for an overhaul of the entire computing network. In 2005, the
contract was awarded to Northrup Grumman, a major defense contractor. The contract provided
$2.4 billion over ten years to implement and manage a modern-day system to serve 76 state
agencies. The contract, to be managed by the Virginia Information Technology Agency (VITA),
wasthelargestcontractofanykindeverawardedinVirginia’shistory.
Theprojectwasplaguedfromthebeginningwithpoorperformanceandmissedschedules.Under
Governor Robert McDonnell, an October, 2009, legislative audit showed that the system had
disrupted service at almost every state agency. There were an abundance of complaints about
poor service and cost overruns. Rolling outages occurred because of the failure to install
redundant communication networks. Northrup Grumman admitted it was nine months behind
schedule.Yetthestate’sCIOwasfiredforcriticizingNorthrupGrumman’sperformance.
As a result of the audit, the contract was renegotiated in April of 2010. In return for increased
penalties for poor performance, the contract was extended by three years and fattened with an
additional$100million.
The Debacle
TheCause
AroundnoontimeonWednesday, August25,2010, a largestorage area network (SAN) in adata
center in Chester, south of the state’s capital, Richmond, began sending alert messages that
something wasn’t right. However, a redundant fault-tolerant EMC Symmetrix DMX SAN with
automaticfailoverwasinservice,andtheSANcontinuedoperatingproperly.

;
It was determined by the maintenance staff that one of the SAN controllers needed replacing. A
few hours later, a technician replaced the board; and pandemonium erupted. Though the root
cause has yet to be announced, it was the initial belief that the technician pulled the good board
of the fault-tolerant pair. At that point, the dual SAN crashed. 485 out of the state’s 4,800 servers
wereknockedoffline.
Maintenance staff tried through the night to fix the problem but to no avail. A decision the next
day was made to shut down the entire system and to replace all suspected faulty components.

TheRecovery
System testing then showed that the crash had caused severe database corruption. The only
alternative was to rebuild the massive database from magnetic tape, a lengthy process. All data
sincethelasttapebackupwaslost.
Database recovery from tape took almost a week to complete. Even then, only 97% of the data
could be restored. A Minnesota companyspecializing in retrieving lost data was retained, but 3%
of the data was irretrievably lost. For instance, thousands of photographs and signatures
submittedbyresidentsfordrivers’licensesduringthefourdayspriortotheoutagewerelost.
EMC reacted quickly to try to return the system to operation. They said that they had never
experienced such a disaster in one billion hours of operation of systems all over the world. They
claimed that field experience showed five nines of SAN availability(an average of five minutes of
downtime per year) and that internal checks ensured that dual failures did not corrupt data. It
seems that you can protect data paths from sending corrupt data, but what do you do about fat
fingers?
TheImpact
Theimpactonstateservices was devastating.26of 89stateagencies weredown,manyfor over
a week. One such casualty was the Department of Motor Vehicles. All 74 DMV offices were
closed,leavinganestimated45,000peopleunabletoobtainorrenewdrivers’licenses.
The web site for the Department of Emergency Management went dark. It is used to
communicate with Virginia residents during emergencies. This happened just as Hurricane Earl
was approachingVirginia.Infact,Governor McDonnell declaredastateof emergencyfor Virginia
onSeptember1st,justasthesystemwasbeingrestored.
The State Department of Taxation was unable to access taxpayer accounts and to issue refunds
for seven days. Local and state employees of the Department of Social Services worked through
the weekend to issue food stamps and welfare checks to 380,000 people. The Department of
Juvenile Justice could not release inmates. The Department of Veterans Services could not pay
its bills. The Alcoholic Beverage Control, the Board of Elections, and the Virginia Employment
Commission were down. The state could not process child-support payments or process claims
forunemployment.
Following restoration of services, employees throughout the state government worked long hours
tocatchuponsuspendedservices.

The Consequences
Financial
NorthrupGrummantookresponsibilityfortheoutage.Inapublishedannouncement,itsaid:
“We cannot afford to let any vulnerability in the infrastructure go unresolved. We have an
obligationto[VITA]andthe agencies andcitizens theyserveto learn everything wecanfrom
this occurrence. We will conduct a root cause analysis, carefully analyze and review the
findings,developlessonslearnedandmakenecessarychanges.”
Governor McDonnell, meanwhile, called for an independent third partyto perform an “operational
and performance review” of the outage and of the roles played by both VITA and Northrup
Grumman.NorthrupGrummanstated:
“Northrup Grumman supports the Governor of Virginia Bob McDonnell’s call for an
independent analysis of the situation, from the cause of the initial failure through the process
of restoration that has taken place. Our commitment to this partnership is absolute, and we
are committed to making the Commonwealth’s information technology infrastructure the best
ofitskind.”
Per the contract, Northrup Grumman faces a $100,000 fine. In addition, it will pay $250,000 to
cover the costs of the independent review. Should the review find negligence on Northrup
Grumman’spart,itcouldfacesignificantadditionalfines.
Political
The costs of this outage went far beyond financial considerations. It became a serious political
headacheforRepublicanGovernorMcDonnell.Aspartofhiselectioncampaign,hehadcriticized
his predecessor, Governor Timothy Kaine, for failing to properly manage the Northrup Grumman
contract. He pledged to run such programs as a business. It was for this reason that he
renegotiated the Northrup Grumman contract after he was elected to tighten the penaltyclauses.
Inreturn,heincreasedthecontractbythreeyearsandadded$100milliontoit.
The Democrats are using the incident to call into question Governor McDonnell’s management
style. They point out that Virginia cannot do without the computer systems but cannot afford the
$400millionterminationfee.
Lessons Learned
Fortunately,NorthrupGrummandidonethingright.In designingthesystem,theyelectedtoback
upthedatabaseperiodicallytomagnetictaperatherthantorelyonlyonthereplicatedcopyofthe
database on the fault-tolerant SAN. Otherwise, they would have found that both copies of the
database were corrupted with little chance of recovery since any corruption to the online SAN
would have been replicated to the backup SAN. Most if not all of the data for those 26 state
agenciesmighthavebeenirretrievablylost.
However,foradatabasethissize,magnetictapebackupwasperhaps nottherightchoice.There
were too manytapes to manage, leading to lengthy restore times – in this case, several days. In
addition,there was toomuchof achanceof findinga tapethatcouldnotberead. Abetter choice
would have been virtual tape backup, in which tape images are replicated offsite to disk. (From
there, they can be archived to tape if necessary.) Since virtual tape eliminates manual tape-
handlingprocedures,itissimplerandcanbescheduledmoreoften.

Virtual tape can reduce both RPO and RTO. RPO is the Recovery Point Objective, or how much
data loss can be tolerated. RTO is the Recovery Time Objective, or how long an outage can be
tolerated. It appears that Northrup Grumman’s tape backup schedule called for days between
backups, as evidenced by the four days of data loss reported for the DMV. If virtual tape had
been used, the database could perhaps be backed up one or more times per day, significantly
reducing the amount of lost data. Furthermore, recovery time would have been significantly
shortened since it is much faster to reconstruct a database from disk images than it is from
magnetictape.
Last, but certainly not least, it does not appear that recovery procedures had been thoroughly
tested and practiced by the operations staff. It seems like the length of time it took to recover the
database was a shocker to all. If recovery had been tested or practiced, staff would have known
howlongrecoveryshouldtake.
The key lesson here is that if you are going to outsource your data center-operations, include in
thecontractthe requirements todocument,test,and periodicallypracticeall recoveryprocedures
and the right to witness and audit these procedures. This should be a fundamental tenant of any
goodbusiness-recoveryplan.
