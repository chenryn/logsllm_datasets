Ace Data Recovery
December2014
Nothing strikes fear in the heart of a corporate executive as much as the loss of some or
all of his business’ data, whether it is via a hard-disk failure, a crashed RAID array, or
data tucked “safely” away in the cloud. Fortunately, to offer help in these situations are many companies
that strive to recover data from damaged media. One of the largest of these companies is Ace Data
Recovery(http://www.datarecovery.net).
Ace will attempt to recover data from hard disks, RAID arrays, solid-state drives
(SSDs), tape, mobile devices, and cloud environments, among others. A Microsoft
RegisteredPartner,Aceis qualifiedtorecoverlostdatafromMicrosoftExchangeand
MicrosoftSQLdatabases.
In business for thirty years, Ace has locations all over the United States. Four of these locations
(Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas (its headquarters); Houston, Texas; Falls Church, Virginia; and Chicago,
Illinois) are equipped with state of the artcleanrooms.Thesesites include Class 100 andClass 10clean
rooms (less than 100 particles exceeding 0.5 microns per cubic foot or less than 10 particles exceeding
0.5 microns per cubic foot, respectively). Clean rooms are an imperative for recovering data from hard
drivesasatinyparticleunderthediskheadcanscratchthedisk.
Ace maintains twenty-five other locations around the U.S. that can service local customers. These
locationsarrangefordamagedmediatobeshippedtoalocationwithacleanroomifnecessary.
Ace performs all recovery operations on a clone of the damaged media to prevent further damage to the
media or modification of the original data. The typical timefor hard-disk recovery is three to five business
days, though difficult restorations may take longer. Ace provides a 24/7/365 critical response data

Do’s and Do Not’s
Ace posts a useful list of do’s and do not’s on its web site at http://www.datarecovery.net/data-recovery-
tips.html. Prior to attempting anyaction on a damaged storage medium, this list should be consulted. For
instance:

Data Recovery – Hard Drives
Harddrivescanexhibitanyoneofmultiplefailuremodes,including:
 Unabletoboot  Harddrivefailure
 Accidentaldeletionofdata  Harddrivecrashes
 Inaccessibledrivesorpartitions  Fireandwaterdamage
 Unabletorunorloaddata  Surfacecontaminationanddamage
 Datacorrupted  Virusattacks
When working on hard drives that must be disassembled, it is imperative that this be done in a clean
room.
Ace can recover data from a full range of hard disk drives and operating systems.Disk drives include the
followinghard-driveassemblies:
IDE SAS
EIDE SCSI
STAT
Operatingsystemsinclude,butarenotlimitedto:
Windows DOS VMware
MACOS UNIX(selectfamilies) Novell
Linux
Drives from multiple manufactures can be recovered. Manufactures handled by Ace include, but are not
limitedto:
WesternDigital Seagate Samsung
Maxtor Toshiba IBM
Hitachi Fujutsu

Data Recovery – SSD Devices
Ace can recover data from a full range of solid-state drives based on MLC or SLC NAND flash memory
technology. SSDs have higher vulnerability to some defects to which typical hard drives are not as
vulnerable. These defects include abrupt power loss, magnetic fields, and electric charges. Also,
considering the fact that the SSDs have a limited number of write cycles, the ability to write to the device
willeventuallywearout,thusleadingtopotentialdataloss.

Data Recovery – Cloud Environments
Placing several machines as virtual machines in a cloud environment rather than on individual servers
creates an increased risk of data loss, as multiple virtual machines will crash together if a host server
fails.Thefollowingarethemostcommoncauseswhydatainthecloudcanbelost:
 Corruptionofhostserverfilesystems

 VMDKheadercorruption

Data Recovery – Mobile Devices
ACE Data Recovery has developed technology to recover data from Android devices. This technology
supports SSDs, SD andMMC cards,andmonolithic flashmemorydevices.Itis abletorecover datafrom
Android devices whether they have logical corruption or physical damage. Data has been successfully
recovered from nearly every type and brand of Android-based devices produced, such as smartphones,
tablets, laptops, and netbooks. In addition, the Android operating system has been used on cameras,
smartglasses,smartwatches,headphones,andportablemediaplayers.
All information on Android-based devices is stored on the flash media, regardless of whether it is internal
memoryor additional SD cards. Ace has developed an advanced flash recovery technology that consists
of reading individual flash memory chips into raw images, then applying reverse-engineered error
correction and special mapping algorithms to unscramble images and re-assemble them. The resulting
imagecanthenbeprocessedusingexistingdatarecoverymethods.
Ace supports smartphone and tablet devices with Android OS 2.1 and later from Samsung, HTC, LG,
Sony,Motorola,andothers.
Data Recovery – Exchange Server

TypicalsituationsthatcauselostExchangeServer/MailDatainclude:
 Inconsistentfilestate
 Dirtyshutdown
 Corruptedheaderinformation
 Writeerrors
 Duplicatekeys
Ace is able to recover mailboxes located in the Information Store from most errors, such as “jet-engine
errors,” “read verification errors,” database corruption, oversized files, or other problems with the
InformationStore.

 RecoveryofemailaddressesfromActiveDirectorystorage
 Recoveryoffolders,messagesandfileattachments
 Recoveryofnotes,contacts,tasks,andappointments
 Recoveryofcreationdatesforallobjects
 FormattingrecoveredforRTFandHTMLmessages
Data Recovery – SQL Server
SQL Server recovery from a drive failure is often a two-stage process. First, the physical data (raw
sectors) must be recovered in order to gain access to the logical data. If the database will not attach to
SQLServer,thesecondstageisSQLdatarecovery.

In most cases it is possible to return a database to an attachable state. If it is not possible to repair the
database to a point to where it will attach, as manytables and records as possible will be recovered. The
