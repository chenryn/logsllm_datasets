Dear Mr. Glotfelty and Dr. Kamel:
Enclosed is the Final Report of the Security Working Group (SWG) supporting the United States
- Canada Power System Outage Task Force.
The SWG Final Report presents the results of the Working Group`s analysis of the security
aspects of the power outage that occurred on August 14, 2003 and provides recommendations for
Task Force consideration on security-related issues in the electricity sector. This report
comprises input from public sector, private sector, and academic members of the SWG, with
important assistance from many members of the Task Force’s investigative team. As co-chairs
of the Security Working Group, we represent all members of the SWG in this submittal and have
signed below.
Sincerely,
