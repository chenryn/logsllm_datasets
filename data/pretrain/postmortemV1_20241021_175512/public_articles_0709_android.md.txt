The Malware Threat to Android
September2012
Can smart phones be infected by malware? You bet! Furthermore, studies by many security firms show
that Android is the primary mobile target of hackers. Why is this, and what can you as an Android
smartphoneuserdotoprotectyourself?
ItistruethatsmartphonemalwareattacksaremuchrarerthanaresuchattacksonPCs,butsmartphones
are a lot newer. The troublesome fact is that these attacks are increasing at an alarming rate, not only in
termsofactualdeviceinfectionsbutintermsofmalwareversions:
 Sophosfoundthatnewlydiscoveredmalwareversionsincreased41timesfrom2011to2012.
 Juniper Networks reported that malware samples increased 472% between July and November,
2011.
 McAfee stated that threats increased by over 1,200% in the first quarter of 2012 to 7,000 from
600.
 Securityvendorsreported8millionnewattacksinthefirstquarterof2012.
 According to Kaspersky Lab, mobile attacks increased 600% between 2010 and 2011. 65% of
thesewereagainstAndroid
Why Android?
The majority of malware versions and attacks have been against Android mobile
devices. This is not surprising as Android has become the world’s leading smartphone
platform. As of the beginning of 2012, Android had a 59% share of the worldwide
smartphone market. As of the third quarter, there were 500 million Android devices in
use,and1.3millionwerebeingaddedeveryday.
Android is based on Linux and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such
as smartphones and tablets. Developed by Google, Android is available as open-source
under the Apache license. Smartphone manufacturers license Android and apply their own modifications
tothebaseoperatingsystem.Therefore,therearemanyversionsofAndroidoperatingworldwide.

can be downloaded from Google Play, the online store run by Google for music, ebooks, and Android
apps, or from third-partysites.As of mid-2012, there weremorethan600,000 apps availablefor Android,

The Android development team has invested heavily in Android security and has published an extensive
document on the security features of Android.1 However, the Android versions in production have
generally been heavily modified by the device manufacturers, and security features are often
compromisedintheseversions.
Furthermore, the manufacturers are often slow in sending operating system updates to their mobile
devices. Even worse, they maystop updating older models while they are still in use. According to a Bit9
report, manufacturers Samsung, HTC, Motorola, Sanyo, LG, and Sony are slow in upgrading their
phones. Duo Security collected results from 20,000 Android phones that uses its X-Ray vulnerability tool
andfoundthat50%ofthesephoneshadunpatchedvulnerabilities.
Android’s problem of security vulnerabilities due to its fragmented marketplace is compounded by its
large base of application programmers writing apps with no verification by Google. As Juniper Networks
said,
“These days, it seems all you need is a developer account that is relatively easy to anonymize, pay
$25, and you can post your application. With no upfront review process, no one checking to see that
your application does what it says, just the world’s largest majority of smartphone users skimming
past your application’s description page with whatever description of the application the developer
choosestoinclude.”
ThoughGoogleprovides somevalidationof apps that itprovides throughits GooglePlaystore,apps sold
throughthird-partystoresareunvalidated.Thus,hackerscaneasilyincludemaliciouscodeintheseapps.
It appears that the main source of Android infections comes from unvalidated apps obtained through
third-partysites.Compoundingthis problem is thatcybercriminals arecreatingfakeGooglePlaystores to

Because smartphones and tablets are much newer in the marketplace than PCs, mobile malware

With the combination of Android’s market penetration, its security vulnerabilities, malicious apps, and
immature anti-virus software, it is no wonder that Android has become the hacker’s choice for mobile
devices. Coupled with user ignorance of malware threats and the fact that more data is going mobile,
maliciousinfectionsofAndroiddeviceswillcontinuetoescalate.
The Threats
Though the variety of malicious threats is large, there seems to be a few that are reported to be
predominant.
PreloadedApps
Preloaded apps delivered with Android devices by many manufacturers have security vulnerabilities. In
particular,manyofthem donotproperlyenforcethepermissions-basedsecuritymodelthatrequiresapps
to explicitly request permission from users to access personal information. This security hole is often
exploitedbyhackerstocollectsensitiveinformationfromusers.
TollFraud
According to Juniper Networks, SMS toll fraud represents half of malicious attacks on Android devices.
These malicious apps use SMS Trojans to send text messages in the background to premium-rate

numbers (numbers that charge a fee for each call). These result often in huge surcharges to a user’s
monthlybill.Thecybercriminalgetsacutofthegeneratedrevenue.
Rootkits
A rootkit is a type of Trojan that keeps itself hidden from detection. It enables an attacker to have root
access to the operating system. A rootkit can intercept system API calls and as a result can do whatever
the hacker wants to the device and to the user’s data. One particular rootkit described in the literature

What About Apple and iOS?
So far, we have focused on Android. But what about the other major player in the mobile marketplace,
Apple,withitsiOSmobileoperatingsystemanditsiPhonesandiPads?
Interestingly, there seems to be no significant threats that have been detected that target Apple’s mobile
platform.Thereareseveralreasonsforthis.Forone,iOSisnotopensource.ThereisonlyoneiOSinthe
marketplace, and its source code is not available for hackers to study. Thus, if it has security
vulnerabilities(whichitcertainlymusthave),thesearegenerallynotknown.
Furthermore, though older Android operating system versions are often not updated, Apple guarantees
upgradesfortwoyears.
Android’s security weaknesses reside not only in its vulnerabilities, but in its lack of regulation for apps
written bythird parties. Apple validates all apps written for iOS and offers them only in its App Store. iOS

Perhaps thebesttributeto Apple’s mobilesecuritycomesfrom KasperskyLab. Theynotedin May,2012,
that they expect iPhone and iPad to be infected by malware within the year. To be sure, all of the
malwaredetectionvendorshopethatthis willbetrue.However,Kaspersky’spredictionistestimonytothe

Summary
So what can Android users do to protect their mobile devices? It seems that there are three guidelines
(shortofswitchingtoaniPhoneoriPad):
1. Stopbeingcomplacentaboutmobilesecurityandacceptitasaloomingthreat.
2. BecomemoreproactiveinprotectingtheirAndroidmobiledeviceswithanti-malwaresoftware.
3. Install applications only from the Google Store, and avoid applications that look suspicious or
