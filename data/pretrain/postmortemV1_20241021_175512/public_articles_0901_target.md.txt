Target Compromises Millions of Payment Cards
January2014
I’ve never shopped at Target. But this holidayseason, my wife asked me to buy a Target gift
cardtobegiven as aChristmas presenttoafriend’s young son.I found the giftcards nextto
thecashierasIwalkedinandpaidforitwithmycreditcard.
Two days later, I received a call from my credit-card fraud service. Did I just buy $900 worth of lobster?
No!! Mycardcompanyinvalidatedthecharge,cancelledmycreditcard,andreissuedmeanewone.The
timing couldn’t have been worse. It was right in the middle of the holiday shopping season, and it took
four days (over a weekend) to get the new card so that I could continue shopping. In addition, I had to
notify every company that uses my card for automatic payments. I can’t remember who they all are – I
oftenhavetowaituntiltheycallandcomplain.
It was then that I heard of the Target payment card breach. Was I a victim? I’ll never know, but the
chancesaregoodthatIwas.
The Target Card Breach
Target is the third largest U.S. retailer, with almost 1,800 stores in the U.S. and Canada.
Opened in 1946, Target is ranked as the 18th largest retailer in the 2013 Internet Retailer Top
500.
TheAttack
Unbeknownst to Target, hackers gained access to its payment card systems and over a period of almost
three weeks stole the card information of millions of debit cards and credit cards. The attack took place
during the busiest shopping season of the year, from November 27, 2013, to December 15, 2013. Target
disclosedtheattackonDecember18th.
According to Target’s initial assessment, 40 million payment cards that were used in Target stores in the
U.S. were compromised. Cards used in its Canadian stores and cards used online were not affected. All
majorcardbrandswereinvolved–Visa,MasterCard,AmericanExpress,andDiscover.
Information published on the Target website indicated that Target discovered on December 15 that point-
of-sales (POS) systems in its U.S. stores had been infected with malware. The malware captured the
magnetic-stripe information on a card that was being swiped and sent it to the attackers. Target
immediately disabled the malicious code and sent all compromised card numbers to the payment card
companies.

CardScraping
The malware engaged in “card scraping.” This is the process of maliciously accessing the information
stored in the card’s magnetic stripe and sending it to another site. The data that was compromised
included the card-holder’s name, the card number, the expiration date, and the CVV (Card Verification
Value)code.
The CVV is not the three- or four-digit number that is printed (and not embossed) on the back of each
paymentcard.Thatisthe CVV2code.TheCVVcodeisincludedinthemagneticstripetoensurethatthe
physical card is in the possession of the merchant for card-present transactions. The CVV2 code is used
for online or telephone transactions. It ensures that the purchaser is in physical possession of the
paymentcardforcard-not-presenttransactions.
Attackers can use this data to clone fraudulent credit cards and debit cards. All that needs to be done is
to acquire a readily available magnetic-stripe writer and to write the information into the magnetic stripe
on the cards. The fraudulent cards are pre-embossed with some name and card number that does not
correspond to the magnetic-stripe information. However, fraudulent users depend upon the common
practiceofsalesclerksnotlookingatthecardandcomparingtheinformation.
This gap in security is now being covered by some retailers (and the U.S. postal service) by having the
sales clerk enter the last four digits of the embossed card number. The point-of-sale terminal compares
this to the last four digits recorded on the card. Unfortunately, in manycases, the sales clerk simplyasks
for the last four digits and does not look at the card. The fraudulent user simply repeats the four-digit
sequencerecordedonthecard.
StolenPINs
A major problem with debit cards is that they can be used to withdraw cash from ATMs if the PIN is
known. As partof apurchasewith adebitcard,thepurchasermustenter his or her PIN into a PINpad.If
thePINisstolen,thecloneddebitcardcanbeusedimmediatelytowithdrawcashfromATMs.
Upon further investigation, Target discovered that debit-card PINs were also stolen. However, they were
encrypted in the PIN pad with triple DES encryption; and all transmissions of the PIN once it left the PIN
pad were encrypted. The encryption was carried through the entire in-flight transmission of the
transaction to the payment processor. It was only the payment processor that could decrypt the PIN. In
fact, the encryption key is held by the payment processor. Target had no access to the key, so the key
couldnotbestolenbythehackers.
Customer Communications
Once the breach was announced by Target, its call center and website became overwhelmed with
customerstryingtodeterminetheirexposure.Callswentunansweredafterlongperiodsoftime.
Target doubled its call-center capacity in an attempt to handle incoming calls. It quadrupled the capacity
of its proprietary REDcard account management site to handle the inquiry volume. It emailed information
to17millioncustomers–allthecustomersforwhichithadanemailaddress.
To prevent email and phone scams, it posted all official communication to its website. Customers were
encouraged to check the website and to ignore email or telephone requests for personal information
relatedtotheircompromisedcards.

The Investigation
Targetimmediatelylaunchedan investigationintothe breach.It partnered with a thirdpartyforensics firm
to determine how its POS systems had become infected. The U.S. Secret Service and the U.S.
Department of Justice, along with the attorneys general of several states, are also participating in the
investigation.
Then Things Got Worse
The news got much worse in early January. As an early result of its investigation, Target found that its
breach went well beyond the scraping of 40million payment cards.Theydetermined that information had
been stolen from an additional 70 million cards. A total of 110 million cards had been compromised -
aboutonecardforone-thirdofallresidentsintheUnitedStates.
Even worse, the stolen data from these cards included more than magnetic-stripe data. Mailing
addresses,emailaddresses,andphonenumberwerealsostolen.This isthekindofdatathatis obtained
by retailers for online or telephone purchases. Combined with other information that can be found on the
Internet, this could lead to some cases of identity theft (though there is no report of social security
numbersbeingcompromised).
Clearly, the hackers had access to more than just the POS terminals. It appears that they may have
hackedthe webservers thatsupportonlineorderingandobtained the additional informationfrom them or
from the network connecting the web servers to the central servers. Alternatively, they may have gained
access to the databases of the central servers, perhaps also via the POS terminal network that connects
the in-store POS-terminal controllers to the central servers. However, this is less likely since the central
serversaretypicallywellprotected.
The Impact on Cardholders
Fortunately, the impact on cardholders should be minimal – some inconvenience at most. Target offered
free credit-reporting for a year to all affected customers and extended a 10% discount on all in-store
purchasesthroughtheholidayseason.
There was no date-of-birth or social security number information stolen, so there is no chance for identity
theft.
Stolen debit-card PINs were encrypted, so there is little concern that the debit cards can be used at
ATMSorforanyotherpurchases,forthatmatter.
Since CVV2 codes were not compromised, the stolen card data cannot be used for online or telephone
purchases so long as the merchant asks for this information. Unfortunately, many retailers do not ask for
this data, and they may suffer fraudulent purchases. In these case, the merchants are liable for the
losses.
For fraudulent purchases, credit-card holders are responsible for at most $50. The same limit applies to
debit cards except in exceptional circumstances in which the limit may be as high as $500. However,
most issuing banks accept all responsibility for fraudulent purchases, and the cardholder will not be
penalized.
Nonetheless,there were inconveniences imposedonmanycardholders.Iffraudulentcharges weremade

Furthermore, some banks imposed withdrawal and spending limits on payment cards that had not been
reissued. JPMorgan Chase capped purchases at $500 and ATM withdrawals at $100. However, it kept
about a third of its branches open on Sunday, December 22nd, to help reissue cards and support large
cashwithdrawals.
What Should Cardholders Do?
The primary action that an affected cardholder should take is to monitor his or her card and bank
statementsforanyfraudulentactivityandreportthosetransactionsimmediatelytothecard’sissuingbank
(using the telephone number on the back of the card) or to the cardholder’s bank. Provided that reporting
isprompt,thecardholderwillnotsufferanylossfromthosetransactions.
To be really safe, cardholders should ask that their cards be canceled and new ones issued. Debit-card
holdersshouldresettheirPINs.
How Was the Breach Detected?
Brian Krebs of KrebsOnSecurity reported hearing rumors of the breach as early as December 12th. After
confirmingthebreach,hereporteditonDecember18th.
The breach was found by fraud analysts at several banks. The banks began to get reports of thousands
of fraudulent transactions early in December for cards that they had issued. The fraud analysts went to a
well-known underground “card shop,” an online store that sells “dumps” of credit-card and debit-card
information stolen from the magnetic stripes of payment cards. This card shop had recently advertised
thatithadahugenewbatchofmillionsofqualitydumpsforsaleat$20to$100percard.
Any number of cards with any specified characteristics could be purchased. The banks purchased
hundreds of the compromised cards that they had issued (the first six digits of the card number identifies
the issuing bank) and analyzed the recent card transactions. A common thread among these cards was
that they had all been used recently for purchases at Target stores. Target was immediately notified. It
discoveredthemalwareinfectionanddeleteditfromitssystems.
How Was the Breach Implemented
As long as Target’s investigation is continuing, it is making no comment on the mechanics of the breach.
Therefore,thefollowingisstrictlysupposition.
It seems clear that the attack focused on the POS system. It is unlikely that the attackers infected the
POSterminalsdirectly.Theirprogramsareprobablystoredinfirmwareandcannotbemodified.However,
the POS terminals in a store are controlled by a local server, typically running Windows. Windows
systems are a favorite target for hackers. A good guess is that the attackers gained access somehow to
Target’s POS network that connects the POS servers to the central site. They then infected the POS
servers in each store. As payment cards were swiped at the POS terminals, the magnetic-stripe data,
including the encrypted PINs, was sent to the local POS terminal server. There, malware read the data
andsentittotheattackers.
However, the attackers were also able to steal information not on the card magnetic stripe, including
physical addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses. This is information that is provided by
cardholders when they make online purchases. The hackers may have been able to gain access to the
web servers that provide online purchase services or to the network connecting these web servers to the
centralservers.Alternatively, theymayhavebeenabletohack intothecentralserver databases from the
POS network that they had infiltrated. However, this is less likelysince central servers are generally very
wellprotected.
Again,thisisstrictlyconjecturebasedontheknownfacts.

The U.S. Lags in Payment Card Security
Sadly, this breach needn’t have happened if the U.S. payment industry had kept up with payment card
securitythewaytherestoftheworldhas.IncommonuseinEuropeandmanyothercountriesistheEMV
(Europay, Master Card, Visa) standard. This standard defines a payment card with an integrated

By U.S. government regulation, the U.S. card industry must be converted to the EMV standard by 2020.

Summary
The Target breach is one of the most serious data breaches in U.S. history and illustrates a common
attribute of such malicious attacks.Target had no idea that the attack was underway. It was almost three
weeks before it became aware of the attack. As is often the case, Target found out about the attack
becausesomeoneoutsideoftheorganizationdetectedtheattack.

Management)appliancetomonitorthelogs,itmighthavedetectedthebreachearlyonandcontainedthe

One thing that Target did correctly was to give priority to customer communication. It emailed its
customers, posted frequent updates to its website, and expanded the capacity of its call centers and
websitestohandletheincreasedtrafficfromconcernedcustomers.
This sort of hacking is on the rise as more tools become readily available on the web. Even novices can
