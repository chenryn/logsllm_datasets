Hospitals Under Ransomware Attacks
July2016
Hackers have found that hospitals are a soft target for ransomware cyberattacks.
Their security is not strong, and their data is absolutely essential for patient well-
being. The hospitals are therefore very willing to pay modest amounts of ransom to regain access to
compromisedpatientinformation.
The attacks are typically carried out via phishing techniques. An employee is sent a seemingly harmless
email.However,whenanattachmenttotheemailisopenedorareferencedwebsiteisvisited,malwareis
copied into the employee’s computer. From there it can travel to every computer on the network. The
malware encrypts whatever data it finds, and then sends a message to the organization asking for a
ransominordertobegiventhedecryptionkey.
The ransomware also can be injected into a computer via a USB thumb drive or a diskette left lying
around. It is likely that some employee will insert it into his computer, thus infecting the computer and all
othersonthesamenetwork.

Beth Israel Deaconess
Beth Israel Deaconess takes a cautious approach to computer security. It does not attach any of its

However, its medical-records computer needed an operating-system update. The manufacturer sent a
technician to do the job. He connected the computer to the Internet and started the download of the
update.Hethenwenttolunch.

out that Chinese citizens cannot get a visa to travel outside of the country if they have an infectious lung

Boston Children’s Hospital
Boston Children’s Hospital was struggling with a controversial case involving a teenage girl. She had
been takenintostatecustodyafter her parents continuedto pushfor treatments considered bydoctors to
beunnecessary,claimingthatherailmentwaslargelypsychological.
ThehactivistgroupAnonymous viewedthis as an infringementof thegirl’s rights.Theydecidedto punish
the hospital by launching a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack against the hospital.
Unfortunately, they attacked the hospital’s subnet rather than its URL, taking down Harvard University
andallofitshospitals.
Hollywood Hospital
Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center uses computer systems for patient-care documentation and for
sharing lab work, X-rays, and CT scans.Their systems were attacked on February5, 2016; and malware
encrypted many of these files. Hospital staff could not access the medical records for many of their
patients.
The hospital systems were down for two weeks until they agreed to pay a ransom of 40 bit coins (about
$17,000).Thiswasafteraninitialdemandfor$3millioninbitcoins.

Another pair of Southern California hospitals was hit with similar ransomware attacks less than a week
later.
Massachusetts General Hospital
Hackerscreateda phonywebsite thataccuratelymimickedMass General’s payroll portal.Theythensent
emails to Mass General’s affiliated physicians instructing them to go to the fake website and authorize a
bonuspayment.
When doctors did this, the hackers stole the doctors’ credentials and used them to change the doctor’s
direct-deposit information in the actual payment system. The hackers used the doctors’ money to buy
Amazongiftcards.
Alvarado Hospital Medical Center
Alvarado Hospital Medical Center is located in San Diego, California, U.S.A. It is owned by Prime
HealthcareServices,whichowns41otherhospitalsacross14states.
Prime Healthcare detected malicious software infections in March 18, 2016, in its Alvarado systems and
in the systems of two other hospitals, Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital. The

What Defenses Can Hospitals Deploy?
There are several steps that hospitals can take to protect themselves from attacks such as those
describedabove.
 Makecopies of all data.Thesystem administrator can thensimplywipeoutthe infecteddataand
replaceitwiththenon-corruptedcopy.
 A further step is to back up every computer system with another computer that is not connected
to the same network. If a system becomes corrupted, simply replace it with the non-corrupted
system. If all hospitals did this, the motivation for hackers to conduct this type of attack would be
removed
 Craftaplan.Assignsystemstotiers,andprotectthemostcriticalsystems.
 Testtheplan.Thebestsecurityplanisworthlessunlessyoutestitbeforeyouhavetorelyonit.
 Work with qualified cybersecurity vendors. The hospital should expand the capabilities of its

 Employ multi-layered protection. Protect every access point to the hospital’s computer systems,
includingemail,webgateways,USBthumbdrives,andinsiderthreats.
 Educate the hospital’s staff. Staff members should be familiar with all sorts of risks such as
phishingemails,unapprovedwebsites,andUSBflashdrivesnotobtainedfromtrustedsources.
