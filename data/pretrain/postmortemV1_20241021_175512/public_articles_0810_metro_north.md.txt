Metro-North Taken Down by Redundant Power Failure
October2013
A portion of the Metro-North railroad, connecting commuters in Connecticut with New York
City, was taken down for almost two weeks by a dual failure of a redundant cable feeding
power to its tracks. Workers had impossibly long commutes as major highways were turned
intovirtualparkinglots.
Metro-North
Metro-North is the busiest rail line in the United States, servicing 125,000 commuters. It stops at 38
stations in 23 towns. Its rail network comprises nine branches connecting major towns in Connecticut to
GrandCentralStationinNewYorkCity.
All of Metro-North’s lines are electrified. It runs only electric locomotives. Amtrak shares Metro-North’s
tracksforitsservicetoBostonandtonorthernpointsbeyond.
About 40,000 commuters ride the New Haven line during each rush hour. This is the line that was taken
downbythepoweroutage.
The Redundant Power Failure
On Wednesday, September 25, 2013, at 5:20 AM – the beginning of the rush hour – trains on the busy
New Haven line of Metro-North came to a halt. Theyhad no electric power. The power cables feeding an
eight-milesectionoftrackhadfailed.
How could this have happened? Metro-North provides
dual 138,000-volt power cables for all of its rail
sections.Whathappenedtothebackuppowercable?
As it turned out, the backup cable for this track section
had been taken out of service in Metro-North’s New
Vernon substation for an upgrade. It was part of Metro-
North’s USD $50 million program to add capacity to its
linessothatitcouldaddexpandedserviceinthefuture.
However, the backup cable had not been taken out of
service casually. During the summer, Metro-North had
thoroughly tested the 38-year-old power cable that was

forthecablewasthirtyyears).Usingthiscabletopowerthetracks,Metro-Northranextratrainstoensure

Having concluded successful tests, Metro-North took the backup cable out of service on September 13th.

inspectittofindoutwhathadhappened.
The outage affected more than the New Haven line. Though many commuters elected to work at home,
many more attempted to get to work. Parts of Interstate 95, the major automobile corridor from
ConnecticuttoNewYorkCity,becameavirtualparkinglotwithcarsbackedupformorethanfifteenmiles
during rush hour. All construction was halted on the major roadways leading into New York City to try to
easethecongestion.

Attempts to Restore Service
Metro-North determined that the primary power cable that overheated was unrepairable. Service could
notberestoreduntilthebackupcablecouldbeputback intoservice.It wasestimatedthatthismighttake
threetofourweeks.
To provide some level of service during this period, Metro-North began running diesel locomotives on the
New Haven line between Grand Central Station and Stamford, Connecticut, where the power outage
terminated. It was able to put 24 diesel engines into service. In addition, it ran 60 buses between
Stamford and other Metro-North rail lines to ferry commuters to operating trains. However, these efforts
providedaservicecapacityforonlyone-thirdofthenormalcommuterload.
Officials desperately tried to find alternate sources of power. They finally settled on a plan with
Consolidated Edison, the major power provider for the area, to put into service three massive
transformers that would siphon power from the local residential power grid and feed it to the dead Metro-
North rail section. It could only provide 13,000 kilowatts compared to the normal 100,000 kilowatts of
power used by the rail section, but at least it would get some electric locomotives working. In effect, a
newpowersubstationwasbeingbuiltinjustafewdays.
Thiseffortwassuccessful.ThecapacityoftheNewHavenlineincreasedfrom 33%ofitsnormalcapacity
to 65% by October 2nd. In addition, the return of the backup cable was proceeding nicely; and the three-
to-four week estimate was firmed up to three weeks, with the expectation of service restoration by
October 14th. However, trains were running more slowly than usual because they were making all of the
localstopsratherthanrunningexpress.
The outlook for service restoration continued to improve. The backup cable finally went into service on
Monday,October7th,justshyoftwoweeksaftertheoutage.
The Cause of the Outage
It is still not clear what caused the primarypower cable to overheat and fail. The onlyclue that has come
out from Metro-North is that workers were using liquid nitrogen to freeze cooling oil in the backup cable
that they were upgrading and accidentally also froze a portion of ground nearby. It is not clear what this
had to do with the primary power cable failure. Metro-North personnel have been doing twenty freezes a
yearfordecadeswithnoproblems.

Summary
The power outage was costly to Metro-North, incurring an estimated USD $2 million dollars per week.
Metro-North is giving weekly and monthly ticket holders full credit against future tickets for days lost due
totheoutage.
Interestingly, the American Society of Civil Engineers has recommended for years that a third cable be
putinplacetomaintainredundancyduringperiods ofplannedor unplanneddowntimeforacable.Maybe
Metro-Northwillnowhearthisrecommendation.
