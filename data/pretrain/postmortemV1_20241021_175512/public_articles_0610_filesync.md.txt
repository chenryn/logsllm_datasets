FileSync and CSR Synchronize NonStop Systems
Part 1 - FileSync
October2011
A common technique for guaranteeing system availability is to configure a backup system that can take
over processing should a production system fail. A major hurdle to achieving high availability with
active/backup architectures is configuration drift. If the software versions of programs, scripts, and
configuration files resident on the backup system are not up-to-date, version conflicts may prevent the
backup system from operating properly. Failing over to the backup system following a production system
failure may be unsuccessful, resulting in a failover fault. Equally important, testing failover is made much
morecomplexifversionerrorsmustbetrackeddownandcorrectedinordertosuccessfullypassatest.
To ensure that a failover will be successful, it is important that all versions of software running on the
backup system match that of the properly operating production system. Tools are available to compare
the production system software modules to those on the backup system to detect version errors. If such
errorsarefound,operationsstaffmusttakestepstocorrectthem.
A more advanced solution is to have a facility that not only will detect version errors on the backup
system but that also will automaticallycorrect such errors. Such a facility is FileSync from TANDsoft, Inc.

SynchronizingtheBackupSystem
Threeclassesofobjectsareinvolvedinsystemsynchronizationtoensureproperfailover:
 Audited Databases: Several products are available for replicating changes in real time to a
NonStop audited database, whether it be Enscribe or SQL. They include RDF from HP,
Shadowbase from Gravic, Inc., DRNet from Network Technologies, Replicate from Attunity, and
GoldenGate from Oracle. These products read changes from the TMF source audit trail and
replicatethemtothetargetdatabase.
 Unaudited Files: The primaryfunction of FileSync is to synchronize unaudited files. An unaudited
file may contain several types of data, such as program source code and executables, scripts,
configuration files, or application data. FileSync ensures synchronization of unaudited files by
replicatingtheentirefileorbyreplicatingonlythechangestothefile(FileSyncAudit).
 Configuration Changes: Various NonStop utilities are provided to change the configuration of the
processing environment, such as FUP and SQLCI. These configuration changes must be made

FileSync
FileSync synchronizes application environments and unaudited files across one or more NonStop
servers. The target servers may be disaster-recovery systems or other production systems (for instance,
serversinanactive/activenetwork).Bidirectionalreplicationinanactive/activeenvironmentispossibleby
configuringaFileSyncsubsystemforeachdirection.

FileSync can replicate files across either Expand or TCP/IP links, though the use of Expand is the more
efficient option. However, TCP/IP is required if the node names of the source and target servers are the
same.

InvokingFileSync
FileSync is invoked via a TACL (Tandem Advanced Control Language) script. The script includes many
parametersandoptionsthatareprovidedtocontrolFileSync.Theyinclude:
 JobID:EachFileSyncjobisgivenadescriptiveID.
 Fromfilelists:FilesthataretobereplicatedareincludedinoneormoreFromfilelists.Theseare

 Interval:ThetimesatwhichFileSyncistobeinvoked.
 Rename: A target file that is open for read-only access or execution can be synchronized by
renamingthecurrentlyopenfile.

Replication can be made to a target file opened for read or execute access (typically a program object
file) if the Rename option is specified. In this case, the open file is renamed; and the source file is
replicatedtothefilename.Onthenextopenofthatfile,thenewfilewillbeopened.
A source file that is open for write access (providing that it is not opened exclusively) can be replicated if
the Open option is used. This option should be used with great caution. If the source file is modified
duringreplication,thedestinationfilemaybecorruptandunusable.
A file will onlybe replicated if the user (or program) initiating the request is authorized to access both the
sourceanddestinationfiles.
Triggers
FileSync can generate a trigger either before a synchronization job begins or when it ends. The trigger
invokes a TACL script, a TACL macro, a TACL obey file, a TACL command, or a TACL RUN command,
which can perform any desired function. For instance, programs can be SQL-compiled after a FileSync
jobcompletes.Abatchprogrammightbelaunched.Nodenamescanbemodified.
OtherFeatures
FaultTolerance
FileSync can be optionally configured to be persistent in the event of a fault that takes down any of the

ParallelProcessing
If a FileSync command includes multiple file lists, each file list can run in a different CPU. If multiple
instantiations of FileSync are running (for instance, to serve different business units), they can run in
differentCPUs.
FileSync uses theFrom/Tolistspecifyingthefiles to bereplicatedtobuilda filesynchronization package.
It passes this to other utilities to build an archive file, as described later under FileSync Architecture. An
archive file has a configured maximum number of replicated files that it can hold. If the number of files in
the file synchronization package is too large, the archive file will spawn multiple sub-files. Each of these
archivesub-filescanbereplicatedbydifferentFileSyncinstantiationsrunningindifferentprocessors.

Reporting
FileSync provides several statistical options. Everystep is logged in a TACL Log file that can be followed
to determine the status of a running FileSync job. The completion statistics for each FileSync job are
recordedintheLogfileandinaHistoryFileforlaterreferenceandanalysis.
The FileSync monitor, FSYNcom, provides a monitoring interface to FileSync. FSYNcom will report the
status of a currentlyrunning job using the Log file and the completion statistics based on the HistoryFile.

FileSyncArchitecture
The heart of FileSync is the SRVSYNC process. A copy of SRVSYNC must run on the source system. It
mustalsorunoneachtargetsystemifTCP/IPisusedasaninterconnect.
AFileSync instantiation is startedeithermanuallyor bySCF byinvokingaTACLscriptonthesourceand
target systems. The script specifies whether FileSync is to be run at scheduled times, at intervals (in
increments of minutes), or once interactively by an operator. Alternatively, FileSync can be started by
NETBATCH
SRVSYNCisstartedasprocess$TSYN(thedefaultname)onthesourcesystem.IfTCP/IPisbeingused
to connect the sites, SRVSYNC is also started on the target system with the name $RTSYN (default
name). If there are multiple instantiations of FileSync, the source and target SRVSYNC processes will
havedifferentnames.
$TSYN willparseitsFROMfilelistand willcheck thefilesonthetargetsystem toseewhichfilesmustbe
synchronized. If Expand is being used, $TSYN can access the target files directly to make this
determination.IfTCP/IPisbeingused,$TSYNchecksthetargetfilesvia$RTSYN.
FileSync then builds a file synchronization package, which is a list of files to be synchronized. Guardian
and OSS files are placed in different file synchronization packages. Guardian file synchronization

packages are sent to the NonStop backup/restore utility PAK, which will package the files into an
optionally compressed backup archive. FileSync passes OSS file synchronization packages to the open
utility PAX (portable archive exchange) utility, which builds a similar backup archive. HP’s BR2 is used to
archiveSQL/MXtablesforreplication.
If Expand is being used, the PAK archives are read by the UNPAK process on the target system. PAX
archivesarereadbyPAXonthetargetsystem.Theseutilitiesaccesseachfilefromthearchivestoredon
the source system and write them to the target database. When UNPAK (or its OSS equivalent PAX)
completes,theFileSyncjobiscomplete.
If the link between the systems is TCP/IP, then the archived file sets are sent to the target system over
the TCP/IP channel. $RTSYN passes the archive to the UNPAK or PAX process, as appropriate, which
writes thefiles tothetarget database.WhenUNPAKor PAX has finished,$RTSYN notifies $TSYN of the
completion.
Upon completion, $TSYN writes the job statistics to the History File and notifies the TACL that the job is
complete.
As each step in the process completes, the TACL is notified and writes an event to the Log file. It also
generates EMS (Event Management Service) messages for warnings, errors, and completions. EMS
messages are sent to $0 by default, but FileSync can be directed to send the messages to another
collectorifdesired.
Operations personnel can use the monitor process, FSYNcom, to monitor the progress of a job by
inspecting the Log file. The completion statistics in the History File also can be viewed. In addition, a job

FileSync Audit
FileSync replicates an entire file when something – even one byte – is changed. This is appropriate for
small files that seldom change, such as configuration files. However, an Enscribe database file can be
verylargeandveryactive.Replicationofitinitsentiretycanbeprohibitive.

FileSync Audit is a FileSync extension that replicates only changes to an Enscribe file (audited or not).
FileSync Audit takes advantage of TANDsoft’s OPTA (Online Process Tracer and Analyzer) intercept
technology. The OPTA library configured for the interception of Enscribe file operations is bound into a
user program that is updating the file to be replicated. No application changes are needed. Each file
modificationisinterceptedandpassedbyOPTAtoFileSyncAudit,whichcapturesthechangeandplaces
itintoanauditedorunauditedchangelog.
The change log is periodically replicated by FileSync to the target system. FileSync Audit on the target
systemupdatesthetargetcopyoftheEnscribefilewiththechangesinthechangelog.
FileSync in Action
Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania, serves as a good example of a FileSync user. The
hospital purchased two NonStop Blade systems to use in a production/disaster recovery architecture.
Theyunderstoodfromthebeginningtheimportanceofkeepingthesetwosystemsinsynchronization.
FileSync was recommended to them by another NonStop shop that had been using FileSync for years.
LVHtesteditandinstalleditinApril,2011. Sincethen,FileSynchasperformedtrouble-free.
LVH uses FileSync to synchronize its unaudited files every four hours and its system pack twice a day
over an Expandlink. FileSync schedulingis accomplishedviaNetBatch. Unauditedfiles includethosein
LVH’s GE Healthcare system as well as a variety of other files used by other applications. Audited files
arereplicatedbyShadowbasefromGravic,Inc.
Rich Karluk, Lead Subject Matter Expert at LVH, observes that “It is pretty impressive that FileSync can
check60,000filesandsynchronize600changedfilesinsixteenminuteswithverylittleCPUoverhead.”
Summary
In manyactive/backup architectures, ensuring that backup system software versions correspond to those
on the production system is imperative to prevent failover faults. FileSync periodically compares the
sourceandtargetfilesofimportanceandupdatesout-of-datetargetfiles.
This still leaves configuration changes that have been made by system utilities such as FUP and SQLCI
but that are not reflected in the target system. TANDsoft’s Command Stream Replicator satisfies this
need. It replicates to the target system changes made to the source-system configuration by NonStop
utilities,thuscompletingthesynchronizationcycle.CSRisdescribedinthesecondpartofthisseries.
