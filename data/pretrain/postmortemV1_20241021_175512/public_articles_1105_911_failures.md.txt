911 Systems Are Failing Too Often
May2016
It should be obvious without saying that U.S. 911 services are among the most mission-
critical of all computer applications. “911” is the nationwide U.S. emergency number that
will immediately get the caller to assistance. If a 911 service fails, lives and property are put at risk. A
crisis call for an ambulance, to police, or to a fire department may go unanswered or be seriously
delayed.
Yet asimpleGooglesearchof “911 failures” yields pages of references to 911 system failures across the
country. In some cases, the failure is the result of inadequate backup systems. In others, it is a
consequenceofthefailureofanotherwiseadequatebackupsystem.

Erie County, New York
Buffalo, New York, is the anchor of Erie County. Erie County had just spent tens of millions of dollars on
upgrading its 911 system. Yet on March 30, 2016, the system went out of service for three and a half
hours,beginningat3am.
The problem wasn’t noticed until a dispatcher realized that calls were not coming in. This was a half hour
after the actual fault had occurred. Dispatchers went to a secondary location to which calls were
supposedtoberoutedif theprimarylocationfailed.However,emergencycalls werenotbeingdivertedto
this location. Fortunately, since it was off hours, not many calls were expected. Dispatchers had no idea
howmanycallswerelost,thoughsomecallswereeventuallyanswered.
The problem turned out to be a malfunctioning air conditioner and a failure of its backup. A service
technician was dispatched to the site and found that the temperature in the computer room had risen to
120° Fahrenheit. A warning system that was supposed to broadcast an alarm hadn’t worked, and the
backupairconditionerdidnotturnon.Circuitbreakershadtrippedtoprotectthecomputingequipment.
To make matters worse, the repair man hit an emergency kill switch for power, thinking it was an air
conditioner reset button. Now the entire facility was without power. This shut down every emergency
responseterminalinthepublic safetybuildingandrenderedthephonesystems andpush-to-talk systems
useless. Dispatchers resorted to their cell phones for communications. An electrician had to be called in
toresetthepower.
In the event of an outage of the main call center, emergency calls were supposed to be diverted to four
otherbackupcenters.However,oneofthesecenterswasfloodedwithcalls.Anothercenterreceivedonly
two calls. The other two centers received no calls. When staff tried to establish a backup call center at
one of the idle sites, the system failed to recognize the new site. The result was long waits for callers to

When the air conditioning system was fixed, the 911 systems were rebooted in a particular order. The
systemcamebackonlineat7:30am.
During the three-and-a-half hour outage, about forty emergency calls were answered, including one
suicideofawomanwhojumpedoffaneight-storyparkingramp.
Erie County periodically tests its 911 backup procedures, and these had always worked. However, a
poweroutagewasneversimulated.
Verizon is responsible for ensuring that 911 calls be answered in the event of a primary system
shutdown. Erie County has begun an investigation into Verizon’s facilities to determine why calls weren’t
divertedduringtheoutage.
Las Vegas, Nevada
OnTuesday,February2,2016,thecityofLasVegassufferedasix-hourbreakdowninits911emergency
response system. The outage affected not only its 911 system but its 311 police and fire information
systems.
Emergencycalls were answeredfrom about3:30pm until10pm bydispatchers inneighboringNorth Las
Vegas. Las Vegas police were sent to neighboring cities to help handle the volume. Nevertheless, many

The Las Vegas 911 center typically receives hundreds of calls an hour. This interruption was considered
to be a critical infrastructure failure. Las Vegas had recently spent $2.3 million upgrading its 911 system

Pinellas County, Florida
Pinellas County in Florida is home to St. Petersburg and Clearwater. On February 17, 2016, at around
10am, the county’s 911 system suddenly failed. The outage was caused by a “routine” software upgrade
bythecounty’snetworkprovider.

During this time, all medical and police dispatch calls were diverted to the St. Petersburg Police
Department. The Police Department then rerouted calls to each appropriate law enforcement agency.

Rerouting of calls through the St Petersburg communication center is part of the county’s emergency
contingencyplan.
Cleveland, Ohio
Nearly 500,000 people in Cleveland, Ohio, were left without 911 service for several minutes during the
early morning hours of Thursday, March 3, 2016. AT&T had announced that it planned maintenance on
telephonelines betweenmidnightand5am thatmightaffect911services.Itthen revisedits statementto
indicatethattherewouldbenoimpactto911services.
However, 911 services suffered an outage from 2:17 am to 2:38 am. Twelve calls went unanswered.
When service was restored, dispatchers were able to call everyone back. None of the calls had been
emergencycalls.
Washington, D.C.
On Saturday, April 2, 2016, high winds in the Washington, D.C. area caused several power outages.
Power to the D.C. 911 call center was knocked out at 11:25 pm. Apparently, a power spike caused the

911 services were relocated to a backup site. No 911 calls were delayed or impacted. However, 311

The power outages also took down Internet services. First responders turned to radios for
communication.

CenturyLink Fined
Olympia, Washington, suffered a six-hour 911 outage in April 2014. CenturyLink is the provider of 911
servicesforthestate’ssevenmillionresidents.
Recently,stateregulators finedCenturyLink $2.85millionfor theoutage.Furthermore,thecompanymust
regularly report to the Utilities and Transportation Commission on 911 circuit reliability and a transition to

Lessons Learned
As with all mission-critical systems, 911 systems must provide a backup facility so that operations can
continue in the event of a primary system failure. Equally important, the backup facility should be
periodicallytestedtoensurethatitisoperational.
As is clear in many of the incidents described above, backup failures were communication-oriented. The
backup sites functioned properly, but 911 calls did not get properly rerouted. It appears that backup
testing did not always thoroughly test the communication side of things. This is perhaps because
communications and communication rerouting are the responsibility of a telephone company such as
VerizonorCenturyLink,andgettingthesecompaniestocommittoabackuptestmightbeaproblem.
Nevertheless, as seen above, it is imperative that all phases of the backup plan be exercised periodically
andthoroughly.
