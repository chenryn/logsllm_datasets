Continuous Availability Featured at HPTF 2009
June2009
Continuous availabilityis a major topic at this year’s HP TechnologyForum and Expo (HPTF&E),
(www.hptechnologyforum.com) to be held in Las Vegas from June 15th through the 18th. Dr. Bill
Highleyman, Managing Editor of the Availability Digest, will be
contributing with two talks on active/active systems –
“Eliminating Planned Downtime in Active/Active Networks” and
“AchievingCenturyUptimeswithActive/ActiveSystems.”
There are several other excellent presentations and SIGs
(Significant Interest Groups) dealing with continuous availability
and high availability, many highlighting active/active technology.
Abstracts focusing on continuous availability and the titles of
sessionsdealingwithhighavailabilityarelistedbelow.
Of particular interest to many of you is HP’s announcement of its new TMF (Transaction
Management Facility) Synchronous Gateway,1 which lets a third-party replication engine join a
TMF transaction. Sessions 3111, 4621, and 4106 will show you how third parties are striving to

Continuous Availability Sessions - NonStop
AchievingCenturyUptimeswithActive/ActiveSystems
Dr.BillHighleyman,ManagingEditor,AvailabilityDigest
Session4422–Wednesday2:30PM
This session will describe how active/active systems work and why they work. Their availability
will be compared to active/backup configurations and clusters. The session will explain data-
replication techniques to keep the distributed database copies that are so important to
active/active systems, and it will review currently available replication products. Examples
showing how to perform cost/benefit analyses of active/active systems will be given. Finally,
active/activeconceptswillbeexemplifiedbyacasestudy.
In today’s 24x7 environment, the continuity of business functions is paramount. This means IT
systems that never fail, even in the presence of disasters that may wipe out a data-processing
center. Furthermore, disaster recovery is insufficient—recovering from a data-processing fault
can take hours and can cost an enterprise dearly. What is required is disaster tolerance. Ideally,

users should be unaware that there has been an IT failure; or at least they shouldn’t be
inconvenienced.
Disastertoleranceistherealm ofcontinuousavailability.Continuousavailabilityis beingachieved

EliminatingPlannedDowntimeinActive/ActiveNetworks
Dr.BillHighleyman,ManagingEditor,AvailabilityDigest
Session2561–Tuesday,5:00PM
The session will describe the procedures for eliminating downtime in active/active systems.
Several case studies of systems currently in production will be described. Active/active systems
comprise multiple processing nodes using replicated database copies to cooperate in a common
application. These systems are capable of attaining availabilities in excess of six 9s, or an
average downtime of less than 30 seconds per year. Therefore, there is no time available for a
system to be taken down for maintenance for any reason whatsoever. However, planned
downtime can be eliminated in active/active systems by rolling upgrades through the system
node-by-node. Since a node can be removed from service and subsequently reliably restored,
thisprocessiscompletelytransparenttotheusersofthesystem.
The techniques described in this session are also applicable to active/backup systems that are
properlyconfigured.
The procedures that will be discussed in this session are extremely important in today’s 24x7 IT
environments, where planned downtime can be as costly to a company as unplanned downtime.
In the past, planned downtime was needed to migrate to new hardware, new operating system
versions,new databasemanagementversions, and new applicationversions,as wellas to install
new applications. However, gone are the days of a two-hour maintenance window over the
weekend.Today,systemsmustbecontinuouslyavailable.Planneddowntimeisnotpossible.
NonStopServerBusinessContinuityUpdate
WendyBartlett,DistinguishedTechnologist,HP
Session3111–Tuesday,11:45am
At this session, you will hear about the latest improvements to the full product set for HP’s
NonStop disaster-tolerance solution: Remote Database Facility (RDF) 1.9, Transaction
Management Facility (TMF) 3.6, AutoTMF and AutoSYNC updates, and SQL Data Definition
Language (DDL) Replicator, plus the new TMF Synchronous Gateway for use in active/active
replication by partners. All these products run on all the latest HP NonStop platforms, and RDF
1.9 will be available for all currently supported server types, from the S series to the new HP
Integrity BladeSystems. The session will also review highlights of the expanded RDF System
Manual, with guidelines for achieving the fastest switchover and takeover. In addition, it will
discussongoinginterestinHPNonStopactive/activereplicationenvironments.

Time-SensitiveApplicationsinVirtualizedEnvironments
JackDiGiacomo,ProductManager,TANDsoft
Session3068–Wednesday,10:30AM
This session explores the available time-simulation solutions that allow production and backup
systemstosupportworldwidevirtualizedenvironmentswithoutaffectingnormalsystemoperation.
These solutions become all themore important as increasing numbers of businesses consolidate
their IT environments onto fewer systems or into a virtual data center. While delivering many
benefits—significant savings, improved service levels, enhanced speed and reliability, reduced
network complexity, and more—consolidation also brings challenges. Companies often become
so focused on the benefits that they fail to adequately anticipate and prepare themselves for the
issuestheymustresolve.
Onesuchchallengeisthatofaddressingtime-sensitiveapplications.Companiesnowconsolidate
many applications serving worldwide locations onto a set of servers at a single processing
environment. However, doing so creates the dilemma of how these time-sensitive applications
run under their own local clocks, in their own time zones. Today’s businesses use one system to
host multiple applications with different date/time requirements. As a result, problems arise with
having to provide each application with its own clock and calendar for development, testing,
production, disaster recovery, and qualityassurance activities. Time-simulation solutions address
thesechallenges.
OptimizingMulti-NodeConfigurationsforPerformanceandIndestructibility
RandallBecker,R&DProgrammeManager,Nextbridge
Session3661–Wednesday,10:30AM
This session will examine the challenges that can arise when taking advantage of the HP
NonStopplatform’suniqueabilitytodistributedataandbusinessservicelayersseamlesslyandin
a linearly scalable fashion. The session will introduce a number of suggestions for organizing
data for performance, including the use of geo-technical proximity (how close it is on the Internet
to the user), SQL/MX partitioning, and service allocation. Active/passive and active/active
configurations will also be presented and compared as options for improving performance.
Finally, the session will examine various approaches for improving performance in non-failure,
failure,andmaintenanceoperatingscenarios.

ESX 3.5 on HP c-Class Blades, Virtual Connect, and HP StorageWorks Enterprise Virtual Arrays
(EVAs). The session will focus on real-world examples of VMware and HP best practices. For
example, participants will learn how to double their storage I/O; how to make Virtual Connect
really “connect” to Cisco Internet Protocol (IP) switches in a true active/active fashion; how to
configure Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) for the Virtual Connect modules and VMware
Virtual Switches; and how to solve the firmware headaches with Virtual Connect. Further,
participants will receive valuable VMware and Virtual Connect cheat sheets to use during their
design and implementation. A basic understanding of VMware ESX and HP c-Class blades is
recommended.
