Americans who generally have little wealth, no emergency cash, and limited access to credit to help
them bridge the gap during a difficult time. And for those who rely on the alternative financing of
RushCards—prepaid debit cards aimed specifically at underbanked Americans—things have gotten

Theself-drivingcarisreadyforprimetime,butyoustillcan'thaveone
In September, Google (or Alphabet) held a press event to show off the latest data from the
company’s formerly secretive self-driving car project. Media members got to take rides in two

Applepullsinfectedappsaftermalwarestrikes AppStore
Apple just pulled a slew of iOS apps from the App Store after security researchers discovered
malware in some of the store’s top apps. The malware worked its way into the App Store through an
unauthorized version of Xcode, the code developers use to build iOS apps. Developers downloaded
the sham version of Xcode from a Chinese server because it was faster than downloading it from
Apple’s U.S.-based server. Only developers who had shut off Apple’s safety warnings could install
