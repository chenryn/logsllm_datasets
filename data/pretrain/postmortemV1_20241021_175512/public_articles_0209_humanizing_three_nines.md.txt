Humanizing Three 9s
September2007
Isthree9sofavailabilitysufficientfortoday’sdataprocessingsystems?Theansweris“maybe.”It
alldependsupontheapplication,
In data processing terms, an availability of three 9s means that a system will be down about 45
minutespermonth,oralmostninehoursper year.ForPCsandmanynoncriticalapplications,this
may be sufficient. However, there are critical applications that require four, five, or six 9s of
availability because of the cost of downtime in terms of dollars, publicity, and/or loss of life or
property.
But what if our lives were governed by three 9s? Below, we list some of the consequences of
suchanenvironment.1Thesestatistics applytolifeintheUnitedStates.Multiplybyten togetthe

If Our Life Were Governed by Three 9s
 Therewouldbeatleast20,000prescriptionerrorsmadeeachyear.
 10,000 new cars each year would be returned to dealers as unacceptable under the
“lemon”laws.
 More than 15,000 newborn babies would be accidentally dropped by doctors or nurses
eachyear.
 If you went to an ATM once per week, you would find one that didn’t work once every
twentyyears(wouldn’tthatbenice).

 If we used our PC 40 hours per week, we would have to reboot it once every two weeks
(thatwouldbeanimprovement).

Would We Want to Live in a World of Three 9s?
Isuspectthateachofyoucouldaddmoreitemstothislist.
Just as with data processing applications, three 9s in our lifestyle is wonderful in some cases
(voters, smokers), is satisfactory in others (dropped cell phone calls, PC reboots), and is
unacceptableinstillothers(droppingnewbornbabies,telephoneservice).
In data processing, we experience three 9s from industry standard servers, four 9s from fault-
tolerantsystems,five9sfromclusters,andsix9sfromactive/activesystems.Three9savailability
is satisfactoryfor a large number of applications, would be wonderful for some that don’t achieve
thatnow,andwouldbeunacceptableforcriticalapplications.
But I don’t think that we would like to live in a world of onlythree 9s.Wesometimes can live with
two 9s; we sometimes need six 9s. Like applications, our needs range from the casual to the
critical;andthecriticalhavetobehighlyavailable.
