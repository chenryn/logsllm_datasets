Postmortem

## **Incident Report**

Incident Date: January 15, 2022\
Incident Number: PR-2762

### **Major Incident Summary:**

On January 15, 2022, at 9:00 AM ET, Tucows' engineering team began
planned maintenance work to migrate the Enom platform to a new cloud
infrastructure. Due to the complexity of the cutover, the team
encountered many issues resulting in continuous delays. The maintenance
window was extended multiple times to address issues related to data
replication, network routing, and DNS resolution issues impacting
website accessibility and email delivery.

### **Incident events breakdown and resolution steps:**

On January 15th, 2022, at 11:33 PM ET, the database replication was
completed, and the team continued with the rest of the migration steps,
which extended the maintenance window for six (6) hours beyond the
scheduled time. Unfortunately, the maintenance exceeded this extended
period, and it was further extended several times due to issues with
network routing, port exhaustion and DNS resolution.

On January 17th, 2022, at 2:00 AM ET, the maintenance was completed;
however, a number of issues remained unresolved and new ones were
identified. The engineering team continued to investigate the issues as
they were being identified via internal and external reports.

On January 17th, 2022, at 10:30 AM ET, customers' ability to make DNS
updates was disabled to avoid interference with our efforts to restore
our DNS service. At this time, it was also identified that resellers
could not search for or view their list of domains under management.

On January 17th, 2022, at 1:00 PM ET, an interim solution was
implemented to address the DNS resolution issues that had impacted
customer websites and email service delivery. At this time, we also
restored customers' ability to view existing domains. Later in the day,
at 11:35 PM ET, the team restored customers' ability to make DNS
updates.

On January 17th, 2022, at 5:00 PM ET, payment processing issues were
identified with PayPal and credit cards. The credit card processing
issue was resolved at 9:00 PM ET. The PayPal payment feature was
disabled on January 17th at 8:45 PM ET and on January 21, 2022 at 1:30
PM ET, we released a solution to re-enable it.

On January 18th, 2022, at 5:55 AM ET, we identified that Enom Control
Panel login-attempts were failing due to missing configuration on one of
the web servers. This issue was resolved at 8:30 AM ET.

On January 18th, 2022, at 10:00 AM ET, the engineering team identified
issues with system notification emails, including password reset emails
and Registrant Verification (RAA) emails. The system notification emails
were delayed due to routing changes and new IP assignments, causing
deferral by the recipient. As a result, the engineering team worked with
global providers to add the new IPs to their allow lists at 12:00 PM ET.

On January 18th, 2022, at 3:30 PM ET, all Enom services were validated
and the major incident was deemed resolved.

### **Learnings and process changes to prevent and mitigate future issues:**

1.  ***Simplifying our approach to complex maintenance work***

In an effort to make the data center migration more seamless from our
customers' perspective, we opted to complete the entire migration in a
single maintenance period. At the time, we felt this was the right
decision. Moving forward, we plan on taking a step-by-step approach to
large-scale migrations, staggering the work into shorter maintenance
sessions over a longer period of time. 

We also introduced a new DNS provisioning system as part of this
migration, rather than simply mirroring the existing setup on the new
infrastructure. This increased the complexity of the migration. Going
forward, we will reduce the number of moving parts by handling
maintenance work separately from the introduction of new system
components.

2. ***Enhancing our monitoring practices***

We monitor all aspects of our systems and operations, but during this
incident, we have identified some gaps. We are addressing these
immediately, and the end result will be better high-level visibility
that will allow us to identify and respond to complex scenarios faster. 

3*. **More thorough planning and better migration readiness*** 

Pre-migration, we conducted testing and identified possible failure
scenarios. During the migration, the major failure we encountered, which
resulted in missing DNS records, was one that we had not foreseen. In
the future, we will conduct more robust crisis planning. This will
involve spending more time identifying possible failure scenarios to
develop a more nuanced migration roadmap that will not only help us
avoid issues, but respond to any that do arise faster. This will be
supported by a more thorough peer-reviewing process.

4. ***Extend Communications***

We know that many of our customers felt that our communications during
this incident were insufficient. We will gather additional customer
feedback and are committed to using alternative channels, outside of
email, to communicate with customers. We will also validate customer
contact information within the platform to ensure communications reach
the intended customers.

### **In summary**

This incident report does not conclude our investigations and planning
to prevent future system outages and downtime. We let you down and
ourselves in the process. We are very sorry to all those who were
impacted. We will do better. 

We would also like to acknowledge our community who, despite the
downtime and increasing stress levels, continued to treat us with
respect and work collaboratively with our teams. This is not just a
business to us, we value our customer relationships, many extending
decades long, and want to continue to nurture and build long-lasting
partnerships. 

If you have any questions or feedback, please contact our customer
service team at <help@enom.com> 

Thank you,

Tucows Engineering Team

\* Select resellers are not able to refill their accounts using PayPal\
\* Enom experiencing isolated credit card processing issues\
\
Our engineering team continues to implement a system-wide solution to
resolve all issues. At this time, the ability to update DNS records via
the Enom Control Panel and API will remain disabled. Any DNS update
requests have been backlogged and will be provisioned as soon as we've
implemented our system-wide solution. For new domain registrations that
use our DNS, there will be a delay in DNS provisioning until the
"system-wide" solution is in place.\
\
The next update will be provided no later than 9:00 PM EST (02:00
UTC).]

Update

[As of 1:45 PM EST (18:45 UTC), all websites are resolving. Our
engineers continue to work on a system-wide solution, and once it is in
place, updates to DNS records will once again process normally via the
Enom Control Panel and API.\
\
Any DNS update requests have been backlogged and will be provisioned as
soon as we've implemented our system-wide solution.\
\
The next update will be provided no later than 5:00 PM EST (22:00
UTC).]

Update

[As of 1 PM EST (18:00 UTC), our engineers have introduced an interim
solution and continue to work on a system-wide solution, both of which
will resolve the DNS resolution issue that certain end customers have
been experiencing.\
\
No action is required from customers. As of right now:\
\
\* Impacted customers should see their websites resolve imminently\
\* Any email service interruptions related to missing MX records should
be resolved\
\* Resellers can now successfully generate the list of domains in their
account using the Enom Control Panel\
\
If you continue to experience resolution issues, we recommend clearing
your browser history/cache.\
\
At this time, the ability to update DNS records via the Enom Control
Panel and API will remain disabled. Any DNS update requests have been
backlogged and will be provisioned as soon as we've implemented our
system-wide solution.\
\
