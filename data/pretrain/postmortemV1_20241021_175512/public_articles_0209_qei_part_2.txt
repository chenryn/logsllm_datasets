connections are used, these relatively slow communication rates limit the SCADA system event
rate to typically twenty to fifty events per second. However, LAN speeds of 10 to 100 mbps
eliminatethislimitation.
RTUs support management from the Master Station via SNMP (Simple Network Management
Protocol)overLANandWANconnections.

RTUs are not redundant, though they support redundant communication channels. Even in the
extreme heat, cold, and stormy conditions in which RTUs must operate, QEI data accumulated
over 25 years shows an RTU MTBF (mean time before failure) of 200,000 hours (about 23
years).Mostfailuresarecausedbylightningstrikes.
TDMSSoftwareArchitecture
TDMS runs under the OpenVMS operating system. OpenVMS is a verymature operating system
that is tailored for real-time operation and is extremely secure, an attribute demanded by power
utilities.1OpenVMSruns65%oftheworld’senergymanagementsystems.
The TDMS software provides data acquisition, point control, alarm processing, tagging, zoning,
event logging, and reporting, among other functions. Add-on applications implement customized
functions such as load management through voltage adjustments and/or through the disabling of
customerequipment.
Through its software services, TDMS maintains an image of the state of all field devices in its
memory. As each point state change is received from the RTUs, TDMS’ memory state map is
updated. It is also updated with the results of anycomputed points. Periodically, the state map is
verified via an all-data poll, which asks all RTUs to send the current state for all of the points that
theyaremonitoringtotheMasterStation.
Changes to device state are written in an event log to disk. In addition, changes to point
configuration maps, and one-line diagrams, are recorded on disk. The memory-resident state
map is not maintained on disk since it changes rapidly and is transient in nature. Furthermore, it

Active/Active Redundancy
TDMS also supports active/active redundancybyconfiguring a second system synchronized with
theactivesystem.
Active/ActiveDualModularRedundancy
A second TDMS Master Station can be configured to back up the active primary Master Station.
All of this system’s processes are enabled, and its database is synchronized with the active
system’sdatabase.Thesystemisreadytotakeoverprocessinginstantly.
However, in a SCADA application, this second system cannot be actively processing events
alongwiththeprimarysystem.Thisisbecausealleventsmustbeprocessedinsequence,justas
theyaregenerated in thefield.Otherwise,afalseconditionmaybe reported.Therefore,onlyone
Master Station can be active at any one time. Though this is truly an active/active architecture, it
must necessarilybe used as an active/standbyconfiguration with nearlyinstant takeover.We will
thereforerefertothesecondsystemasthestandbysystem.
The active and standbysystems maybe collocated, or theymaybe geographically separated for
disaster tolerance purposes. The systems are connected by LAN if they are collocated. They are
connectedbyWAN,suchasaT1link,iftheyaregeographicallyseparated.
The controller Worldview consoles have access to both systems via a LAN, which may be either
a dedicated or a corporate LAN. Alternatively, if the standby system is remote, a separate set of
consolesmaybeprovidedattheremotefacility.

DatabaseSynchronization
The TDMS database contains, among other things, a log of all events, the current point
configurations, and the current maps and one-line diagrams. As events, point configuration
changes,mapchanges,orone-linediagram changesareprocessedbytheactiveMasterStation,
theyarewrittentodisk.Theyarealsosentoverthecommunicationchannelconnectingtheactive
system to its standby. At the standby system, this same data is written to its disk so that the
databases are in synchronization. Should the active system fail, no events or configuration
changes will be lost (except, perhaps, those that were in the replication pipeline at the time of
failure).
The memory-resident state maps are not replicated since they are highly transient in nature and
areeasilyreconstructedfollowingfailover,asdescribednext.
Failover
Theactive andstandbysystems alsotradeheartbeats over their interconnectingchannel. Should
the standby system detect a loss of heartbeat from the active system, it takes over control of the
system. Its processes are all enabled, and it has an up-to-date database. However, it does not
havethecurrentstateofthefielddevices.
Therefore, it must issue an all-data poll to its RTUs. It polls its RTUs for current device state
simultaneously on all communication channels. Depending upon the number of points being
monitoredbythesystem andthespeed of thecommunication lines,this typicallytakes anywhere
fromthirtysecondstotwominutes.2
As it receives device status, the new Master Station builds its own in-memory state map and

ModularRedundancy
The TDMS SCADA system can be configured with dual modular redundancy, as described
above. It also can be configured with triple or quadruple modular redundancy. A typical triply
redundant system would include an active/standby pair at the primary site and a standby system
attheremotesite.
A system with quadruple redundancy would comprise an active/standby pair at the primary site
andanequivalentstandby/standbypairattheremotesite.

As indicated above, no matter what the level of redundancy, only one master station may be
activeatanyonetime.
AvailabilityExperience
The TDMS-PLUS OpenVMS systems are maintained by HP. If HP’s 24x7 maintenance is used,
HP guarantees a five 9s (five minutes per year) availabilityfor its hardware and software through
its Service Level Agreement. An 8-to-5 next-business-day maintenance agreement is also
available.
In all of its experience, QEI reports only one redundancy failure attributable to TDMS. That was
when two systems tried to take over the active role. Other failures are quite infrequent, and are
generallyduetoinappropriateconfigurationchangesmadebythecustomer.
Summary
QEI has been delivering SCADA equipment for almost 50 years, beginning with tone equipment
fordatatransmissionunderitsoriginalname,Quindar.
Sincethen,ithasgonethroughmanyevolutionsoftheMasterStation:
 1965–Hardwiredcontrolpanel.
 1968–Integratedcircuit-basedcontrolpanelswithcomputerloggers.
 1974–Firstminicomputer-basedMasterStationusingTexasInstruments960.
 1981–MasterStationusingDECPDP-11.
 1986–MasterStationusingDECVAXandVMS.
 1993–MasterStationusingDECAlphaandVMS(QUICS-IV).
 2000–MasterStationusingDECAlphaandOpenVMS(TDMS-2000).
 2004–MasterStationusingHPIntegrityandOpenVMS(TDMS-PLUS).
QEI’s TDMS system reflects decades of field experience. Its current systems are aimed at
monitoring distribution subsystems for electric utilities and transit systems. With redundancy
levels up to quadruple modular redundancy and with fast failover, QEI’s customers are
