| displayed, altitude and altitude-rate (for example) were calculated   |
| from the metric state vector maintained by navigation, and then were  |
| converted to feet and ft/sec. It would have felt weird to speak of    |
| spacecraft altitude in meters, and both thrust and mass were commonly |
| expressed in pounds. Because part of the point of this paper is to    |
| show how things were *called* in this era of spaceflight, I shall     |
| usually express quantities in the units that it would have felt       |
| natural to use at the time.                                           |

| By now the area on the second floor of 75 Cambridge Parkway where we  |
| monitored missions had been moved to a larger space, but on July 20,  |
| 1969 the room was crowded despite efforts to keep it clear for those  |
| of us who were most involved in this phase of the mission. We         |
| listened to a squawk box in a nondescript classroom, while a quarter  |
| of a million miles away a manned spacecraft emerged from behind the   |
| moon and approached its orbital low-point (perilune) of about 50, 000 |
| feet above the cratered surface, where the lunar landing burn would   |
| begin.                                                                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The crew keyed in Verb 37 to select P63, the phase that controlled    |
| the preparations for Powered Descent Initiation (PDI) and stayed in   |
| control until the burn achieved its first set of targets. The         |
| computer processed an algorithm to compute the exact time for         |
| ignition and the attitude the LM should be in at that time. Next the  |
| spacecraft maneuvered to that orientation. At the time of ignition    |
| the engine bell would be pointed almost dead ahead, directly opposing |
| the spacecraft\'s orbital velocity.                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Now the computer issued code 500. It thought the landing radar        |
| antenna was in the wrong position. The crew saw that the relevant     |
| switches were already in the right positions, but they cycled them    |
| anyway and the warning cleared. This had no connection with the       |
| events that would follow, but it nourished our suspicion of           |
| \"discretes\", those signals that told the computer some fact like    |
| the position of a switch or an antenna --- but sometimes lied.        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Control passed to BURNBABY --- the master ignition routine that we    |
| wrote after LM-1 to save memory by exploiting the similarities among  |
| the powered flight phases in the period leading up to ignition. Verb  |
| 06 Noun 62 appeared on the DSKY. The middle register contained a time |
| in minutes and seconds that began to count down toward light-up. At   |
| 35 seconds the display went blank, and at 30 seconds reappeared. This |
| was a signal that Average-G had started. At seven and a half seconds, |
| the ullage burn began. At five seconds, the display flashed to        |
| request a \"go\" from the crew. Buzz Aldrin, the LM Pilot, standing   |
| on the right side of the cockpit, had the main responsibility for     |
| working the DSKY. Now he keyed PROCEED.                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| At Mission Elapsed Time (MET) 102:33:05 self-igniting propellants     |
| came together in the descent engine and it lit up at 10% throttle.    |
| Armstrong did not even feel the gentle push --- less than 1/25 G. The |
| display changed to Noun 63 and the three display registers now showed |
| a total velocity of 5559.7 ft/sec, an altitude-rate of -2.2 ft/sec,   |
| and an altitude of 49971 feet\[8\]. The gimbals that pivoted the      |
| descent engine moved to align the thrust vector with the              |
| spacecraft\'s center of mass. Then, 26 seconds into the burn, the     |
| software throttled-up the DPS to its maximum thrust of 9870 pounds    |
| (43, 900 newtons), 94% of the engine\'s official rating of 10500      |
| pounds, and at the same time enabled the descent guidance.            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| P63 was called the braking phase because its only purpose was to shed |
| horizontal velocity. It would end in about eight minutes when the     |
| spacecraft reached target conditions known as \"high gate\" at about  |
| 7400 feet altitude. Figure 5 illustrates the phases of the lunar      |
| landing.                                                              |

| At MET 102:36:55 Neil Armstrong, the Commander, standing on the left  |
| side of the LM cockpit, used his joystick to spin the spacecraft      |
| about its thrust axis so that the windows, which had allowed the      |
| astronauts to look down at the surface while hurtling forward feet    |
| first, would point out into space, where Earth was visible. But the   |
| spacecraft was rotating too slowly. Armstrong realized the autopilot  |
| rate switch was at 5 deg/sec and switched it to 25\[9\]. Just before  |
| the maneuver was complete the landing radar signaled \"data good\".   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| It was not possible to navigate so accurately as to touch down safely |
| on the lunar surface with no local knowledge of its relative distance |
| or velocity. The landing radar provided this information. Despite the |
| \"reasonability check\" performed by the software, radar data could   |
| not be incorporated into the state vector without crew (and ground)   |
| approval. So about five minutes into the burn Aldrin keyed in Verb 16 |
| Noun 68 --- a request to monitor a noun whose third register showed   |
| the difference between the altitude sensed by the radar and the       |
| computed altitude. This number, called DELTAH, was about -2900 feet.  |
| This was within the range of expected altitude error. The radar data  |
| could gradually be folded into navigation without adversely affecting |
| the shape of the trajectory.                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Then we heard the words \"program alarm\". In Cambridge we looked at  |
| each other. Onboard, Aldrin saw the PROG light go on and the display  |
| switch back to Verb 06 Noun 63. He quickly keyed in Verb 5 Noun 9.    |
| Alarm code 1202 appeared on the DSKY. This was an alarm issued when   |
| the computer was overloaded --- when it had more work to do than it   |
| had time for. In Cambridge the word went around, \"Executive alarm,   |
| no core sets\". Then Armstrong said, with an edge, \"Give us a        |
| reading on the 1202 program alarm\"\[10\].                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| From here events moved very quickly, too fast for us to have any      |
| input from Cambridge. It was up to Mission Control in Houston. The    |
| story of what happened there has often been told --- how it fell to a |
| 26-year-old mission control guidance officer named Steve Bales to say |
| \"go\" or \"abort\". Bales had participated in a recent review of LGC |
| alarms that had deemed 1202 a \"go\" unless it occurred too often or  |
| the trajectory deviated. He was supported by Jack Garman of NASA and  |
| Russ Larson of MIT in the back room. Garman said, \"go\". Larson gave |
| a thumbs-up. (He later said he was too scared to form words.) So      |
| Bales answered, \"go\", Flight Director Gene Krantz said \"go\", and  |
| capsule communicator Charlie Duke passed it up to the crew. At MIT,   |
| where we realized that something mysterious was draining time from    |
| the computer, we were barely breathing.                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Half a minute elapsed between the alarm and the \"go\" from Houston.  |
| During that time mission control approved the DELTAH, and Aldrin      |
| keyed in 57 to allow navigation to incorporate the landing radar      |
| measurements. Then he tried Verb 16 Noun 68 again and watched DELTAH  |
| decrease to 900 feet. Again a program alarm light. Again Verb 5 Noun  |
| 9 --- 1202 alarm. Again \"go\" from the ground.                       |

| (solid line) During Powered Descent (Simulation Data)                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| At MET 102:39:31 the best possible confidence builder occurred ---    |
| throttle down, right on time. \"Ah! Throttle down\... better than the |
| simulator\" commented Aldrin, \"Throttle down on time!\" exclaimed    |
| Armstrong, their excitement palpable. In the official transcript of   |
| communications between spacecraft and ground during the powered       |
| descent, these are the only exclamation points\[11\].                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The descent engine experienced excessive nozzle erosion if operated   |
| in the range between 65% and maximum thrust. Throttle down occurred   |
| when the thrust required by guidance sank to a level enough below     |
| that limit that a gradual increase through the end of the braking     |
| phase would not force a return to maximum (see Figure 6). Throttle    |
| down was a sensitive indicator of how well the guidance system was    |
| doing. It was also true that if the throttle stuck at maximum an      |
| abort might soon be necessary, because in about 40 seconds the        |
| guidance equations would command the spacecraft to invert.            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| While the LM was still facing the lunar surface Armstrong had clocked |
| landmarks that indicated the LM was further downrange than desired.   |
| He realized now that the computer did not know the lander was going   |
| long\[12\]. Otherwise the engine would have stayed at maximum thrust  |
| for longer as guidance tried to stop short.                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| At MET 102:41:32, as the spacecraft passed through 7400 feet, sinking |
| at 125 ft/sec, high gate was achieved. Guidance began using a new set |
| of targets. The LM pitched forward so that the lunar surface was      |
| visible ahead. On the DSKY the mode register changed to 64 indicating |
| the Visibility Phase, and Noun 64 replaced Noun 63. Two two-digit     |
| numbers replaced velocity in the top register. One was a \"landing    |
| point designator\" (LPD) angle that indicated where Armstrong should  |
| look along a reticle attached to his window to see where the LM would |
| touch down if it were allowed to land automatically. The guidance     |
| system controlled yaw to keep the landing site along the line of the  |
| reticle. The crew could move a hand controller to shift the site.     |
| (Armstrong had stated before the flight that he planned not to use    |
| this capability, but there was apparently one inadvertant             |
| redesignation late in the visibility phase.) The second number gave   |
| the time remaining during which a redesignation could be input. With  |
| the redesignation logic now engaged, this was the busiest period of   |
| the landing.                                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| At MET 102:42:17 a 1201 alarm occurred. It was another Executive      |
| alarm --- \"No VAC areas available\". About 24 seconds later there    |
| was another 1202. Just 16 seconds later, with the lander at 770 feet  |
| with a sink rate of 27 ft/sec, yet another 1202 occurred. Mission     |
| control in Houston called a \"go\" in each case. Neil Armstrong,      |
| whose heart rate rose from 120 to 150 during this period\[13\], put   |
| it this way:                                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Normally, in this time period, that is, from P64 onward, we\'d be     |
| evaluating the landing site and starting LPD activity. However, the   |
| concern here was not with the landing area we were going into, but    |
| rather whether we could continue at all. Consequently, our attention  |
| was directed toward clearing the program alarms, keeping the machine  |
| flying, and assuring ourselves that control was adequate to continue  |
| without requiring an abort. Most of our attention was directed inside |
| the cockpit during this time period and in my view this would account |
| for our inability to study the landing site and final landing         |
| location during final descent\[14\].                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Nevertheless, Armstrong had time to notice that the LPD indicated     |
| \"we were landing just short of a large rocky crater with very large  |
| rocks covering a high percentage of the surface\"\[15\]. So at MET    |
| 102:43:08 (650 feet), after deciding that he could not stop short of  |
| the crater, Armstrong flipped the autopilot mode switch from AUTO to  |
| ATT HOLD to take manual control of the LM\'s attitude. He maneuvered  |
| to zero pitch to maintain horizontal velocity and skim over the rocky |
| area.                                                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (ATT HOLD meant the digital autopilot\'s Rate-Command Attitude-Hold   |
| mode, in which the astronaut could command an attitude rate by        |
| deflecting a joystick. After the stick was released the autopilot     |
| nulled rates to maintain the present attitude.)                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| At MET 102:43:20 (430 feet) Armstrong flicked a spring loaded toggle  |
| switch with his left hand, entering the rate-of-descent mode (P66).   |
| Now the computer controlled the spacecraft\'s thrust to maintain a    |
| rate-of-descent commanded by the ROD switch. A flick upward slowed    |
| the descent by one foot per second; a flick downward increased the    |
| descent rate by the same amount. Using the joystick, Armstrong tilted |
| the LM to null out horizontal velocity and bring the LM to a safe     |
| area for touchdown. After some \"possibly spastic\" control motions   |
| because dust kicked up by the exhaust plume distorted his perception  |
| of translational velocity, at MET 102:45:40, Armstrong landed the     |
| spacecraft safely in the Sea of Tranquility.                          |

| Years before Apollo 11, when the guidance system was first being      |
| conceived, the onboard software was almost an afterthought --- \"Hal  |
| will take care of it\" was the sentiment. In fact it ended up taking  |
| scores of people, with hundreds more in support, but to Hal Laning,   |
| in the early days, fell the job of figuring out how to organize the   |
| numerous software functions that must go on almost simultaneously in  |
| a real-time spacecraft control computer --- in this case one of       |
| limited size and speed.                                               |

| Hal\'s design avoided the pitfalls of a \"boxcar\" executive, in      |
| which the computations must be divided up explicitly between time     |
| slices. A boxcar executive is painful to implement because            |
| computations must be broken up arbitrarily. During development the    |
| allocation may need to be revised whenever any of its parts is        |
| modified or new functions are added. Worst of all, a boxcar executive |
| is a *brittle* system during operation. It breaks down completely as  |
