HPE Spins Off Software Assets to Micro Focus
September2016
I started implementing NonStop systems when Tandem was first announced in the late
1970s. The first Tandem system implemented by my company, Sombers Associates,
Inc.,wasaracetrack totalizatorsystem thatacceptedwagersonhorseracesandposted
theoddsandpayoffsondisplayboardsaroundthetrack.
As Tandem Computers was absorbed by Compaq, which was then acquired by Hewlett-Packard (now
Hewlett Package Enterprise), so have Tandem systems morphed into NonStop systems. The basic
hardware architecture remains unchanged, though the processors have moved from proprietary to
Itanium to x86-based and the duplex ServerNet backbone fabric has been replaced with InfiniBand.
However,thesoftwaresupportingNonStopsystemshasgrownandgrown.
HPE now has announced its plans to spin off its non-core software assets and to merge them (a spin-
merge) with software-company Micro Focus. This move represents a strategic slimming of HPE by CEO
MegWhitmantostrengthenthecompany’s focus onits primarymission–to deliver thepromiseof hybrid
IT,inwhichacompany’sdatacentersareefficientlyintegratedwithitsprivateclouds.
The spin-merge deal is valued at $8.8 billion USD to HPE shareholders. The acquisition of HPE’s non-
core software by Micro Focus will position Micro Focus to be one of the world’s largest software
companies.
Earlier in 2016, HPE spun off its Enterprise Services Division and merged it with Computer Sciences

However, the spin-merge transaction does not affect NonStop Systems. NonStop is not part of the
Software Division that is the subject of the spin-merge. NonStop remains with HPE as part of Mission

HPE’s Focus
HPE’s strategy is to become the industry’s leading supplier of software-defined hybrid IT solutions.While
it spins off its non-core software assets, it is keeping its capabilities for software-defined infrastructure
solutionsandcloudenvironments.
Key to this strategy are core software assets such as OneView and the Helion Cloud platform. OneView
is an infrastructureautomation engine that streamlines the provisioning and lifecyclemanagementacross
compute, storage, and network resources. It enables IT staff to control these resources programmatically

These and other products and services enable a standalone HPE to realize its vision of being the

bridge them to multi-cloud environments. The products and services provide the intelligent edge that will

to realize its vision of being the industry’s leading provider of hybrid IT, merging a company’s IT assets
with its private clouds. HPE’s newly created software-defined and cloud business will build on software

In addition, HPE’s Technology Services will be deployed to help customers transform their IT
environments to hybrid architectures. HPE’s Technology Services include about 22,000 service

Where Does This Leave NonStop?
As previously stated, the spin-merge of software assets to Micro Focus does not affect the NonStop
business directly. NonStop is not part of the Software Division. The Mission Critical Solutions
organization,whichincludessystemssuchasNonStopalongsideSuperdome,remainswithHPE.
However, in some areas the Mission Critical Solutions organization will forge more formal relationships
with the teams that become part of Micro Focus. The NonStop business will move forward with HPE to
continue to provide mission critical solutions that support customers’ needs for hybrid and cloud
environmentsinaccordancewithHPE’sannouncedstrategy.
Summary
When HP split into two companies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Hewlett Packard, Inc, it was to
separate the Enterprise business from the printer and PC business (which remained as HP, Inc.). At that
time, HPE became a major software player across the needs of enterprises. It is CEO Meg Whitman’s

intent to focus HPE on providing world-class infrastructure and services to companies implementing
hybridITsystemsandmergingtheirtraditionalITassetswithprivateclouds(particularlyHPEHelion).
To achieve this goal, HPE is honing itself to focus on the assets that contribute directly to this vision and
divest itself from those that are less crucial. This has included the spin-off of its Enterprise Services
Division to CSC and its non-core software assets to Micro Focus. Both of these transactions will net
significantvalueforHPEshareholders.
Upon the completion of these transactions, HPE will be a slimmed-down company focusing efficiently on
providing infrastructure for hybrid IT architectures to companies. In addition, HPE is using the cash that
these divestments generate to acquire other technologies that add to this capability. HPE has recently
announced that it is acquiring SGI, a global leader in high-performance solutions for compute, data
analytics,anddatamanagement.
