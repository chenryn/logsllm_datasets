The Hack
On July 15, 2015, a team of hackers calling themselves the Impact Team broke into the Ashley Madison
database and stole the entire set of data. According to the hackers, the breach was a protest of the
company’s encouragement of adultery. They demanded that Ashley Madison be closed down or they
would release all of the data. Ashley Madison’s response was that it had incorporated fully effective
securitymeasures.
To demonstrate that they possessed the database, the Impact Team began releasing data on July 22nd.
With Ashley Madison still in business, the hackers continued to release more data until on August 20th,
they released everything. The information, going back to 2007, comprises 60 gigabytes exposing 37
millionmembers.Thedataevenincludesthosecustomerswhohadpaidthedeletionfee.
Thedatais posted onthe DarkWebviaan“Onion” address.This is afacilitycalledTor (TheOnion Ring)
that is accessible only through a Tor browser that is made available only to those who have proven that

How to Find Out If You Have Been Exposed
Though a Tor browser is needed to access the database posted by the Impact Team, as soon as some
data was posted, several sites immediately came online and published the posted data on the public-
facing Internet. These sites included CheckAshleyMadison.com, Trustify, and Have I Been Pwned,
among others. Anyone now could search these databases to see if their email addresses, names, or
phonenumberwerepresent.
However, the Ashley Madison legal team shut down these sites, serving them with a DMCA takedown
demand. DMCA is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Avid Life Media, the company that owns Ashley
Madison,claimsthatitownsthecopyrightdatatothedatabasecontentsandthatnooneelsecanpublish

Just because you may find your spouse or any other person in the database does not mean that they
were a legitimate member of Ashley Madison. Many of those registering used phony or hijacked email
