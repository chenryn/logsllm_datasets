Pop! Goes the Weasel!
June2016
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a multimillion-dollar project near Geneva,
Switzerland, designed to smash subatomic particles together at close to the speed of
light. On April 29, 2016, the LHC lost power despite a series of sophisticated safeguards. A weasel had
chewed through the cable connecting a 66-kilovolt electrical transformer.The fried remains of the weasel
werefoundnexttothegnawedcables.

The Large Hadron Collider
The Large Hadron Collider is located at CERN, the European
Organization for Nuclear Research, in Geneva. It is a
superconducting circular tunnel seventeen miles in circumference
designedtosmashprotons together at nearlythespeedof light.It
isthelargestmachineintheworld.
Constructed between 1983 and 1988, the tunnel straddles the
French/Swiss border. It is twelve feet wide, and its depth ranges
between164feetto574feetunderground.
Beams of protons shoot through the massive collider in opposite
directions at nearly the speed of light. Four laboratories around
the track have batteries of sensors to monitor the collisions.

The LHC generates tens of petabytes of data each year. This mass of data is processed by the

Doubling the Energy of the LHC
The LHC has just gone through more than two years of upgrades to double its power. This allows for
collisionsattwicetheenergythanthatpreviouslypossible.
Last June, after the upgrades, the collider began the hunt for dark matter. It is scheduled to be running
nonstop for the next few years. Scientists are hoping to discover ‘super-symmetry,’ currently the best
candidate for dark matter. The Collider has already discovered anomalies that hint at the existence of a

The LHC Taken Down by a Weasel
In April, 2016, scientists were just getting ready to resume experiments after a winter
shutdown.Suddenly,onApril29,theColliderlostpower.
Repair personnel found that a cable feeding a 66-kilovolt transformer had failed. Upon
further investigation, they found the fried remains of a weasel next to the cable.
Evidently, the unfortunate weasel had gnawed through the cable, causing the power
outage.

Researchers Finding New Evidence

The Higgs boson is a fundamental particle that had been hypothesized first in the 1960s and finally had

Researchers also have seen hints in recent data that other, yet undiscovered particles might also be
generated inside the LHC If those particles exist, they could revolutionize researchers’ understanding of
everythingfromthelawsofgravitytoquantummechanics.
Not the First Time
This is not the first time that the LHC has been ‘attacked.’ In 2009, a bird dropped a piece of bread onto
the electrical system, causing a short circuit and interrupting the power feeding an LHC cooling unit. In

Such problems are not exclusive to the LHC. In 2006, raccoons conducted a ‘coordinated attack’ against

Lessons Learned
Facilities such as colliders that span miles of territory are bound to interfere with nature. Nature will have
its way. The staff of machines such as these must expect occasional interference from nature’s critters
