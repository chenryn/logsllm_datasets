The Causes of Outages
March2013
There are many published statistics that characterize the causes of downtime. A troublesome aspect of
these studies is that they varyall over the place. Though theygenerallyfocus on the same vulnerabilities
– hardware, software, network, human, and environment, the contributions of each of these faults does
notseemtoconvergeintoanymeaningfulnumbers.
Toaddour owninputtothesestudies,weanalyzedover250outagesreportedinourNever Againseries.
The outage reports were all drawn randomly from the press over the last seven years and so should
representareasonablyaccuratecross-sectionofdowntimetriggers.
Sometimes, an outage is a complex interaction among a primary cause and one or more contributing
causes. For instance, if a maintenance technician pulls the wrong board to replace a failed storage-array
controller, thus taking down the entire storage array, the primary cause is a human error; but the
contributing factor is a hardware fault. The failure of the controller board did not cause the outage. The
maintenance technician caused the outage, but he would not have been the cause if the controller board
hadnotfailed.Wetakemultiplefactorsintoaccountinouranalysis.

Hardware
All of the hardware outages were caused either by a server failure, a storage-system failure, or a power-
supplyfailure.TheirrelativeoccurrencesareshowninTable2:

Power outages were generallytriggered bythe failure of the primarypower source followed bythe failure
of the power backup facilities. Backup failures included generators that wouldn’t start, insufficient
generatorcapacity,fuelexhaustion,transferswitchmalfunctions,andflooding.
Miscellaneous
The bulk of miscellaneous faults were caused by capacity overloads that took down systems and by
cyberattacks:

People
Wesave “people” for last. Human errors that directly caused an outage accounted for 12% of all outages
(Table1)andincludedmaintenanceerrors,incorrectoperatorcommands,andpoorplanning.
However, people were involved and must share the responsibilityfor manyother faults, including failover
faults (lack of testing), upgrades gone wrong (improper fallback planning), software bugs (programming
errors), power failures (improper maintenance of power backup facilities), capacity planning, and cyber
attacks. Given all of the above, our reported incidents indicate that people contributed in some way or
anothertoalmost60%ofalloutages.
Summary
Based on these results, it seems that a reasonable rule of thumb for the causes of outages is that
software, networks, and environmental factors each account for about 20% of all outages. Hardware
faults are responsible for about 15% of outages, and people and miscellaneous factors account for 10%
to15%each.Miscellaneousfactorsarealmostevenlysplitbetweencapacityoverloadsandcybercrime.
