Overview of Task Force Recommendations: Titles Only
Group I. Institutional Issues Related to Reliability
1. Make reliability standards mandatory and enforceable, with penalties for noncompliance.
2. Develop a regulator-approved funding mechanism for NERC and the regional reliability councils,
to ensure their independence from the parties they oversee.
3. Strengthen the institutional framework for reliability management in North America.
4. Clarify that prudent expenditures and investments for bulk system reliability (including invest-
ments in new technologies) will be recoverable through transmission rates.
5. Track implementation of recommended actions to improve reliability.
6. FERC should not approve the operation of new RTOs or ISOs until they have met minimum
functional requirements.
7. Require any entity operating as part of the bulk power system to be a member of a regional reli-
ability council if it operates within the council’s footprint.
8. Shield operators who initiate load shedding pursuant to approved guidelines from liability or
retaliation.
9. Integrate a “reliability impact” consideration into the regulatory decision-making process.
10. Establish an independent source of reliability performance information.
11. Establish requirements for collection and reporting of data needed for post-blackout analyses.
12. Commission an independent study of the relationships among industry restructuring, competi-
tion, and reliability.
13. DOE should expand its research programs on reliability-related tools and technologies.
14. Establish a standing framework for the conduct of future blackout and disturbance
investigations.
Group II. Support and Strengthen NERC’s Actions of February 10, 2004
15. Correct the direct causes of the August 14, 2003 blackout.
16. Establish enforceable standards for maintenance of electrical clearances in right-of-way areas.
17. Strengthen the NERC Compliance Enforcement Program.
18. Support and strengthen NERC’s Reliability Readiness Audit Program.
19. Improve near-term and long-term training and certification requirements for operators, reliability
coordinators, and operator support staff.
20. Establish clear definitions for normal, alert and emergency operational system conditions. Clarify
roles, responsibilities, and authorities of reliability coordinators and control areas under each
condition.
21. Make more effective and wider use of system protection measures.
22. Evaluate and adopt better real-time tools for operators and reliability coordinators.
23. Strengthen reactive power and voltage control practices in all NERC regions.
24. Improve quality of system modeling data and data exchange practices.
25. NERC should reevaluate its existing reliability standards development process and accelerate the
adoption of enforceable standards.
26. Tighten communications protocols, especially for communications during alerts and emergen-
cies. Upgrade communication system hardware where appropriate.
27. Develop enforceable standards for transmission line ratings.
28. Require use of time-synchronized data recorders.
29. Evaluate and disseminate lessons learned during system restoration.
30. Clarify criteria for identification of operationally critical facilities, and improve dissemination of
updated information on unplanned outages.
31. Clarify that the transmission loading relief (TLR) process should not be used in situations involv-
ing an actual violation of an Operating Security Limit. Streamline the TLR process.

Group III. Physical and Cyber Security of North American Bulk Power Systems
32.Implement NERC IT standards.
33.Develop and deploy IT management procedures.
34.Develop corporate-level IT security governance and strategies.
35.Implement controls to manage system health, network monitoring, and incident management.
36.Initiate U.S.-Canada risk management study.
37.Improve IT forensic and diagnostic capabilities.
38.Assess IT risk and vulnerability at scheduled intervals.
39.Develop capability to detect wireless and remote wireline intrusion and surveillance.
40.Control access to operationally sensitive equipment.
41.NERC should provide guidance on employee background checks.
42.Confirm NERC ES-ISAC as the central point for sharing security information and analysis.
43.Establish clear authority for physical and cyber security.
44.Develop procedures to prevent or mitigate inappropriate disclosure of information.
Group IV. Canadian Nuclear Power Sector
45. The Task Force recommends that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission request Ontario
Power Generation and Bruce Power to review operating procedures and operator training associ-
ated with the use of adjuster rods.
46. The Task Force recommends that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission purchase and install
backup generation equipment.
