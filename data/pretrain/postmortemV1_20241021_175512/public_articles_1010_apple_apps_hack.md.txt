Malware Attacks Apple Apps
October2015
Apple fans claim that Android’s open nature makes it far more susceptible to attacks by
hackers. There have been many cases of the Android operating system and the smart
phoneswithinwhichitrunsbeinginfectedwithmalware.

The iOS App Store Attack
This secure feeling suddenly changed in September 2015 when thousands of Apple apps were found by
Internetsecurityfirms tobeinfected.Theinfections all occurredinChina, whichis Apple’s secondlargest
market.Chinesedeveloperslaunched130,000newappslastyear.
The infection, called XcodeGhost, hit hundreds and possibly thousands of Chinese iOS apps. They were
products of some of China’s most successful tech companies, and the malware affected hundreds of
millions of Chinese citizens. One of the affected apps was WeChat, the popular Chinese mobile
messaging utility used by 600 million people. Angry Birds 2, TenCent, and PDFReader also are on the
infectedlist.
How Were Apple Apps Infected?
The developers of iOS apps use the Xcode utility delivered by Apple to build their apps. Xcode includes
all the tools needed to develop apps for iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches. The utility provides
stringentsecuritymeasurestoensurethatiOSappsaresecureandarenotmaliciouslyinfected.Thishas
served Apple well for decades and is a key factor in its reputation for selling only secure apps in its App
Store.
However, in mid-2015, several Internet security companies detected malware of some sort lurking in iOS
apps. It was Palo Alto Networks, a U.S. Internet security company, that identified the infection. Palo Alto
Networks determined that Chinese developers had been using an infected version of Xcode. How had
thiscounterfeitXcodemadeitintothehandsofChinesedevelopers?
Itturns outthattherootcause was theChineseInternetinfrastructure.iOS app developers aresupposed
todownloadXcodedirectlyfrom Apple’s servers in the United States. However, downloadingXcode from
an international source was painfully slow for Chinese tech companies. This is a result of China’s
censorship architecture and its weak Internet infrastructure linking it to the outside world. China controls

Therefore, it became the practice of Chinese tech firms to download Xcode from local sources. Xcode
was posted on several Chinese file-sharing sites for just this purpose. One such site was the file-sharing
serviceBaiduYunpan.Asitturnedout,ahackerhadpostedacounterfeitmaliciouscopyofXcodeonthis
site. Any tech firm that downloaded Xcode from Baidu Yunpan received an infected version that would
insertthemalwarethatbecameknownasXcodeGhostintothefirm’siOSapps.
It was this lax security procedure of some of the biggest-name Chinese tech firms that allowed so many
malicious apps to be made available in the Chinese iOS App Store. This is also the reason that the only
compromisedappsaretobefoundintheChineseAppStore.
What Harm Can the Malware Cause?
At first it appeared that XcodeGhost would do little damage except to steal the device ID and other
information of little value to an attacker. However, upon further study, the malware was much more
viciousthanthis.
The attacker can send commands to infected devices to steal personal information. It can conduct
phishing attacks byopening up specific URLs, taking the user to infected web sites. It can read and write
tothevictims’clipboards, anditcan postfakealerts ontothe victim’s screens.Itcandupecustomers into

Apple’s Response
Apple has removed from its App Store the apps that it knows have been created with the counterfeit
Xcode.It has recognized theproblem that Chinesedevelopers have downloading its tools,and it is going
to make these tools available to Chinese developers from Apple servers in China. Furthermore, it will
work with all developers worldwide to make sure that they are using the proper version of Xcode to build
theirapps.
What to Do?
The only defense against XcodeGhost is to uninstall any applications that may be infected with the
malware. This affects primarily Chinese users, as it would be unusual for others to install apps from a
ChineseAppStore.
Some of the more popular apps that may be infected are listed in the articles entitled “XcodeGhost hack:
Delete these infected iOS apps immediately” and “85 legitimate iPhone apps that were infected with

Summary
The Apple App Store had been almost entirely free of malware. This is the first large-scale attack on the
popular software outlet. Prior to this attack, only five malicious apps have ever been found in the App
Store,accordingtoPaloAltoNetworks,theU.S.Internetsecurityfirm.
It is unclear how the altered code withstood Apple’s famously tough app approval process. Developers
face long delays getting their apps approved and often have to wait a week or more for reviews of
updatestotheirapps.
