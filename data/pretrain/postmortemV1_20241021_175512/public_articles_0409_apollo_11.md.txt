Apollo 11 – Continuous Availability, 1960s Style
September2009
Wetalk a lot about continuous availability – systems that virtuallynever fail – as if this is a brand
new concept made possible by today’s technologies of fault-tolerant systems, clusters,
virtualization, and active/active systems. We talk about task-critical systems, in which a fault will
idle workers or production lines, mission-critical systems that can take down a company, and
safety-criticalsystemswhosefailurecanmeanlossoflifeorproperty.
But forty years ago, continuously available systems put men on the moon and got them back
several times without a loss. The entire lunar mission, from launch to translunar coast to landing
and then rendezvous and return to earth, were controlled by computers whose failure would
mean the loss of the astronauts. Against all odds, all systems worked impeccably for the lunar
landings.
How did the technologies of the ‘60s achieve this near-miracle? In this article, we look at the
approaches taken back then to ensure continuous availability. We will find that they were not
much different than what we do today. The ability to achieve continuous availability in our
computersystemshasbeenaroundforalongtime.
The Apollo Mission
On April 12, 1961, the U.S. was galvanized into action when the Russians put Yuri Gagarin into
orbitintheVostok1.TheU.S.wasclearlybehindinthespacerace.1
Shortlythereafter,PresidentJohnF.Kennedythrewdownthegauntlet:

This seemingly impossible goal was met on July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong stepped off of
the lunar lander’s ladder onto the moon and said “That's one small step for [a] man, one giant
leapformankind.”2
This “giant leap” required an investment of $24 billion (in 1960 dollars), 400,000 people, and
20,000industrialfirms anduniversities over an eight-year period.Thecosts of thespacecraftand

rockets added another $83 billion to the tab. The mission continued to put men on the moon five
moretimes,endingfinallyin1972.3
The Apollo Computers
Three main computer complexes were involved in each lunar flight – the ground computers, the
onboardguidancecomputers,andtherocketcomputer.
GroundComputers
TheAvailability Digest was fortunatetohavethe opportunitytospeak with Ed Poole,anengineer
who contributed to the Apollo ground-computer complex during the mission. He joined NASA in
1966 with a mathematics degree, a necessity for the complex navigation calculations required to
guide men to the moon. The following is a description of the ground-control environment that Mr.
Pooleprovidedus.
As he related, the overriding design principle was to be “man-ready.” The entire thrust of the
mission was to successfully put a man on the moon without killing anybody.4 After all, the
astronauts were friends and neighbors. “Man-ready” revolved around redundancy and extensive
testing.
The effort wasn’t easy, nor was it cheap. Redundancy was achieved through the use of five
newly-released IBM 360 Model 75 computers running the MVS operating system. Up to 3,500
IBMemployeesparticipatedinthedesign,implementation,andtestingofthesystem.
To put technology into perspective, at that
time the computer industry was just in the
process of converting from vacuum tubes
to transistors. IBM had delivered its first
transistorized computer, the IBM 7090, in
1959. The computers received by NASA in
1964 were among the first IBM 360s
delivered. The new MVS operating system
was a batch-oriented system but had to do
areal-timejob.

The 360s had a speed of 1.7 MIPS (million

 modifyMVStoprovidereal-timeprocessing.
 specifyerror-recoveryprocedures.
Because the 360 and MVS were batch-oriented, one of the first tasks of the programming group
was to modify them for real time. This required gaining access to the 360 bus structure, a task
that proved to be difficult. Specializedcommunication plugboards had to beconnectedtotheI/O
bus to receive ground tracking, onboard telemetry, and trajectory data in real time. The plug

boards interfaced to the computer bus via a five-way switch so that they could be connected to
anyofthefivecomputers.
As Mr. Poole told us, these computers had to do error recovery in ways no one had ever
considered before. It was for this reason that a special team was devoted to error detection and
recovery. Mr. Poole worked with this team to provide simulation of any conceivable fault to
validate the error-recovery procedures. Communication errors were handled by a 3-bit error
correcting code using a 36-bit polynomial. Uncorrectable messages were retransmitted.
Trajectory errors had to be corrected in real-time. If there were to be an error in the onboard
guidance systems, this had to be accommodated from the ground since the guidance computer
programscouldnotbepatched–theywereheldinROM.
Simulationswerealsoimplementedtotrainastronautsandcontrollers.
At the time, IBM described the six megabyte programs it developed to monitor the spacecrafts'
environmental data and the astronauts' biomedical data as the most complex software ever
written.5
Redundancywas provided via the use of three of thefive IBM computers working in parallel. The
other two computers were available for test and development but could be pressed into
productionifoneofthethreeproductioncomputerswentdown.
Of the three production computers, one was the operations computer, one was a dynamic
standby, and one was a static standby. The operations computer and the dynamic standby
processed all data in parallel. If one went down, the other immediately and automatically took
overcontrolandbecametheoperationscomputer.
Atthispoint,thestaticstandbycomputer was broughtintoserviceasthedynamicstandby.Itwas
brought up-to-date by loading the last data checkpoint and then by replaying all subsequent
events at high speed. Checkpoints were written to tape every fifteen minutes to be used to load
the static standby, and real-time events were written to tape as they occurred. The event tape
wasusedtocompletetheresynchronizationofthenewstandby.6
During this recovery time, operations continued unimpeded. A total system failure would have

standbywassynchronized.Eventhen,onlyasmallamountofdatawouldhavebeenlost;andthe
system would quickly resynchronize with newly received data. Continuous availability was truly
achieved.
There was a lot of demand for computer time. Therefore the static standby was in place only
duringthecriticalphases of launch,translunar coast(during whichthespacecapsule was thrown
out of earth orbit and into lunar orbit), lunar landing, and return to earth. During other times, the
staticstandbysystemwasavailableforotherpurposes.
GuidanceComputers
The onboard Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) controlled the Columbia Command Module (CM)
and the LM Guidance Computer (LGC) controlled the Eagle Lunar Module (LM). They collected
flight information, displayed this to the astronauts, and communicated it to the ground. The AGC
wasdevelopedbytheMIT InstrumentationLaboratoryandwasbuiltbyRaytheon.Therewasone
AGC in the Command Module and one in the Landing Module.7 Those with a need to know

updates to these computers. The guidance systems provided for manual control should an AGC
exhibitproblems.
The AGC ran the LM’s Primary Guidance, Navigation, and Control System (PGNCS). The
PGNCS was backedupbytheAbortGuidanceSystem(AGS) designedbyTRW.TheAGScould

TheAGC was thefirstcomputer touse integratedcircuits (ICs).
All 4,100 ICs were identical three-input nor (negative or) gates.
They were configured to provide flip-flops for data storage and
to provide the logic of the computer. The ICs were socket-
mounted and were interconnected by wire wrap. The decision
to use a single IC design throughout the AGC avoided
problemsthatplaguedother earlyICdesigns thatused amix of

The Apollo project perhaps kick-started the microchip revolution. It bought 60% of the American
commercialproduction of ICs intheearly1960s,temporarilyshoringup an industryfor whichfew

The memory of each of the AGC lock-stepped computers
comprised 2K words of random-access RAM memory and 36K
of read-only ROM memory, each with a cycle time of about 12
microseconds. The word length was 16 bits. The processor ran
at a speed of one megahertz and could multitask eight jobs at a
timeviatimeslots.
Modern-day PCs may be more powerful than the AGC, but the
AGC did much more than plug into a printer and a router. It
interfaced with ground telemetry links, radar rendezvous
systems, landing altimeters, gyro compasses, optical star

trackers,andpropulsionsystems.
Unfortunately, the PGNCS malfunctioned on the first lunar landing. It became overloaded with
radar data from spurious signals generated by the rendezvous radar that had been left on during
descent. Fortunately, the efforts at automatic error recovery paid off. The PGNCS shed some
noncriticaltasksandreturnedtoserviceintimeforasafelunarlanding.

The final computer in this trilogy is the one that guided the Saturn 5 rocket at liftoff. Designed by
