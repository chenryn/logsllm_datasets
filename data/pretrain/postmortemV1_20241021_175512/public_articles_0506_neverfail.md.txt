Neverfail for Windows Applications
June2010
Neverfail, from Neverfail Ltd. (www.neverfailgroup.com), ensures
continuity of user services provided by Microsoft Windows applications
via data replication and automated failover procedures. Neverfail
maintains a local or remote standby server in complete application
synchronization with its primary companion via asynchronous data
replication. It monitors the health of an entire application ecosystem at the business level. If it
cannot resolve a potential availability issue detected on the primary server, Neverfail will failover
theapplicationtothestandbyserver.
Overview
Neverfail is focused on Windows applications. Application monitoring and failover polices are
determined by rules configured into Neverfail. For many common applications, such as
Exchange, SQL Server, File Server, IIS, SharePoint, and BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES),
rules are preconfigured into plug-ins available from Neverfail. Users may modify these rules if
desiredandmayestablishrulesforapplicationsnotsupportedbyNeverfailplug-ins.
Neverfail provides a shared-nothing architecture that supports both physical and virtual
environments. It is hardware agnostic, though the software must be identical on both servers.
Neverfail automatically detects software changes on the primary server and replicates these
changes to the standby server. This eliminates “configuration creep” caused by configuration
changesintheprimaryserverthatdonotgetreflectedinthestandbyserver.
Not only does Neverfail eliminate unplanned downtime, but planned downtime is eliminated as
well by upgrading the standby server and then switching over to it while the primary server is
beingupgraded.
Neverfail’s replication engine and failover procedures can satisfy short RTOs (recovery time
objectives) and RPOs (recovery point objectives). Failover to a standby server following a
primary-server failure is typically about two minutes (RTO). Data loss following a primary server
failure (RPO) is measured in seconds if the standby server is collocated and in minutes if it is
remote.Usersessionsaremaintainedduringafailoversothatusersdonothavetologonagain.

According to the failover policythat has been established for an ecosystem, a failure in one of its
components might cause just that component to fail over,multiple components to fail over, or the
entire ecosystem tofailover.For instance,if failover is toaremotesitethat is thousands of miles

Architecture
SystemConfiguration
A Neverfail environment includes a primary server and a standby server. The servers may be
collocated in the same data center, or they can be hundreds or thousands of miles apart to
providedisastertolerance.
Eachserverisconnectedtotwonetworks:
 Aprivatenetworkforheartbeatsanddatareplication.
 Apublicnetworkforuseraccess.
The private network is extremely critical, as without it the standby server cannot be kept
synchronized with the primary server and is useless as a backup. Neverfail supports an optional
dual private link to ensure server interconnectivity. This is especially important if the servers are

Neverfail supports heterogeneous hardware configurations. The hardware used by the two
serversdoesnotneedtobeidentical.

However, the software on the two servers must be

absolutely identical. The operating systems on
each machine must be the same and must be at

the same service pack and patch level. Disk
names, directory structures, and database
(redundancy
schemas must be identical. All application

executables must be the same version. User
authorizations must be identical. Both servers must
have the same name, and both must use the same publicnetwork
IP address for the public network. The latter
requirement allows users to be moved from the NeverfailPrimary/StandbyPair
primary server to the standby server without losing
theirconnections.
Neverfail ensures that the initial software installations are identical, and it discovers anychanges
made thereafter to the primary server. The changes are replicated to the standby server, thus
ensuringsoftwarehomogeneity.

DataProtection
The Neverfail replication engine maintains real-time consistent copies of all critical data by
replicating it asynchronouslyfrom the primaryserver to the standbyserver. This includes all data

 Databaseschemas
 Applicationexecutables
 Registrysettings

Neverfail replicates not only changes to files and tables but also any change to the application
configuration. In this way, it is known that the configuration of the standby server is always the

same as the primary server. This is necessary to ensure that the standby server will perform

Using Microsoft’s VolumeShadow-CopyService(VSS),Neverfailcan alsoroll back databases to
a previous known consistent state to recover from data corruption or from erroneously-deleted
data.
Monitoring
Driven by the rules for each application that have been previously established, AMF monitors
serverandstoragehardware,networks,andapplications:
 Servers are monitored by the Neverfail heartbeat mechanism. The conditions under
which a heartbeat failure is declared are determined by the rules established for the
application. Rules also specify the action to take upon a heartbeat failure (for instance,
restarttheapplicationorfailovertothestandbyserver).
 Networks are monitored for connectivity. If access to the public network is lost by the
primaryserver,failover is initiatedtothestandbyserver.If theprimaryserver shouldlose
communication with the standby server, further changes are queued and are sent to the
standbyserveruponrecovery.
 Applications are monitored according to pre-established rules. Metrics can include queue
lengths,responsetimes,CPU utilization,storageutilization,memoryutilization,andother
indicatorsofproperoperation.
 Rule-based performance is monitored at the user-expectation level. For instance, test

application must be failed over to its standby, other applications in the ecosystem or the entire
ecosystem can be failed over to ensure continued satisfactory performance. User sessions are
not lost during a failover – users do not have to relog on. Failover typically takes about two
minutes.
Following a failover and the subsequent recovery of the primaryserver, the applications that had

Clusters
Neverfail’s Cluster Protector provides remote cluster site protection for MSCS (Microsoft Cluster
Server)anditssuccessor,WSFC(WindowsServerFailoverClustering).UsingstandardNeverfail
continuity services, a cluster can be cloned at a remote site. Neverfail will monitor the health of
the cluster and will seamlessly fail over to the remote cluster should the primary cluster fail.
Cluster Protector is especially useful to protect a cluster from a catastrophic data-center site
failure.
Virtualization
Neverfail can be used between two physical servers (P2P), between a physical primary server
and a virtual standby server (P2V), between a virtual primary server and a physical standby
server(V2P),orbetweentwovirtualservers(V2V).
One common use for Neverfail P2V is to back up several physical servers with a single virtual
server. Neverfail will keep each physical primary server cloned in a virtual machine on the
virtualizedserverhost.Inthisway,ratherthanhavingonestandbyserverperprimaryserver,only
one physical server is needed to back up several other physical servers. Of course, the virtual

Neverfail supports VMware ESX, Citrix XenServer, and Microsoft Hyper-V virtualization
environments. Neverfail can migrate virtual machines in these systems to remote standby virtual
machinesintheeventofahostserverfailure.
In addition, VMware uses Neverfail to protect its vCenter Server, which is the control hub for the
vSphereinfrastructure.

SCOPE
SCOPE (Server Check, Optimization, and Performance Evaluation) is Neverfail’s diagnostic and
monitoring utility. It is responsible for performing the comprehensive health checkups that
Neverfailusestodeterminecorrectiveactions.
Duringinitialization,SCOPEidentifiespotentialconfigurationandperformanceissuessothatthey
can be corrected before putting the application into production. SCOPE then monitors the
production environment in real time for the same conditions. It discovers changes in

SCOPE monitors many different components of the server and application environment, such as
memory utilization, CPU utilization, disk utilization, and network traffic. It will issue alerts if it

Tertiary Configuration
Tertiary is an extension of the standard Neverfail configuration. It supports three servers – one
primary server and two standby servers. One standby server is collocated with the primary
server, and one is located remotely. Both standby servers are kept synchronized by Neverfail
replication,andbotharemonitoredbyNeverfail.

Should the primary server fail, it will fail over to the local standby server if that server is
operational. Otherwise, it will fail over to the remote standbyserver. In this way, failover time and
data loss are minimized if the local standby is available. However, the remote standby ensures

ContinuousAvailabilityDirector
The Continuous Availability Director (CAD) is the graphical user interface (GUI) to Neverfail. It
provides functions for configuring Neverfail and for monitoring and controlling the organization’s
ecosystems.
It is through CAD that plug-ins are installed. Rules for component monitoring and failover polices
are established for business functions that are not covered by a plug-in, such as special
applications used by the enterprise. Neverfail requires no scripting for the rules and the actions
thattheyinvoke.Allrules areconfiguredvia the CAD GUI.For applications that aresupported by
standard Neverfail plug-ins, no action is required of system administrators since the plug-ins
come preconfigured with applicable rules. However, a knowledgeable administrator has the
flexibilitytomonitorandenhancetheserules.
Once operational, the ecosystem availability states are displayed graphically so that operations
personnelcanrapidlynoteandanalyzepotentialfaultissues.

System operators can initiate a variety of functions via the Continuous Availability Director. For
instance, if a potential fault appears ominous but has not yet met the criteria for an automated
failover, the operator can command a failover. The operator can command a failover if a system
is to be taken down for maintenance. The operator can initiate a rollback of a database to a
consistent point in time if the database has become contaminated or if a file or table has
mistakenlybeendeleted.
Summary
Neverfail ensures the continuity of critical Windows-based business functions by protecting an
entire functional ecosystem. It monitors all components of the ecosystem not only for health but
also for performance from the users’ viewpoint. If any condition that threatens the continuity of a
business function arises, Neverfail will immediately take corrective action, including seamless
failovertoastandbyserverthatmaybelocallyorremotelylocated.
Neverfail’s monitoring and corrective actions are governed by rules established for each
application. These rules are preconfigured for many Windows business-critical applications.
