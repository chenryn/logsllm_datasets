Interview with Ron LaPedis on NonStop with XP Storage
May2007
The editor of the Availability Digest, Dr. Bill Highleyman, was pleased to be granted an
interview with Mr. Ron LaPedis on one of Ron’s favorite subjects – NonStop server
availability.Ron was akeyfigureatHPintheNonStop server worldfor several years before
his retirement from HP. He can now be found at SanDisk, the largest manufacturer of flash
memorycards,locatedinMilpitas,California.
[Highleyman]: Hi, Ron. I’m familiar with many of the roles that you played while at HP with
theNonStopEnterpriseDivision.Whatexactlywerethey?
[LaPedis]: Good morning, Bill. Just before retiring, I was the
product manager of business continuity, security, and
internationalization (I18N) for the NonStop Enterprise Division.
Before that, I held widely varying jobs, such as operations
manager for Shanghai Systems (Scube), network architect for
the India offshore group, and was Tandem’s first continuity
planner.
[Highleyman]: You were very involved in business continuity
planning and security and, I believe, earned many
certificationsinthatfield.Whatwerethey?
[LaPedis]: Well, I guess there are a couple. I hold CISSP
(Certified Information Systems Security Professional), CBCP
(Certified Business Continuity Professional), ISSAP
(Information Systems Security Architecture Professional), and ISSMP (Information Systems
SecurityManagementProfessional)certifications.
[Highleyman]: I know that you have read our articles on active/active systems to achieve
extraordinary availability. What other advice do you have for users to achieve high
availabilities?
[LaPedis]: Availability during system maintenance can be increased through the use of a
backup system with the same processing power as the primary system; through automated
scripts, short NonStop TMF transactions, and automated file replication of non-database
files; and through careful analysis of the processes and procedures needed to switch to the
backupsystem.
[Highleyman]: Does this imply that there is no difference between the primary system and
thebackupsystem?

[LaPedis]: Yes. In reality, this means that the only difference between the primary and
backupsystemsisthecurrentstatus.Manycustomershaverealizedthatonceswitchedtoa
capable backup system, there is no need to switch back to the primary system once
maintenanceiscompleted.
[Highleyman]: Do you have any further tips or tricks to increase the availability of NonStop
servers?
[LaPedis]: There are, of course, many. For instance, there are significant advantages to
using HP’s StorageWorks XP connected to the NonStop server(s) via a Storage Area
Network(SAN)ratherthan‘private’disksconnectedtoeachsystem’sCPU.
[Highleyman]:WhywouldthisincreasetheavailabilityofaNonStopserver?
[LaPedis]: Primarily, with the use of a SAN, it is actually possible to switch disc volumes
fromoneNonStopservertoanotherinsecondsifafewrulesaremet.
[Highleyman]:Whatarethoserules?
[LaPedis]: First,theNonStopservers musthavethesamenodenames andnode numbers.
Second, the TMF catalog and audit trail volumes must be switched along with the protected
data volumes. At this time, $system still must be on a private disk volume, However, the
TMF catalog does not need to be on $system. In fact, moving it from $system is one of the
easiestperformanceenhancementsthatyoucanmaketoTMFonabusysystem.
[Highleyman]:Canyougiveusmoredetailonthecommunicationconfiguration?
[LaPedis]: The setup looks like this. Both systems are defined with the same node name
and node number, so of course there cannot be an Expand network between them. TCP/IP
and other network addresses can be the same or different. If they are the same, then of
course the two systems cannot be on the LAN at the same time, which severely limits
systemconfigurationandmanagement.
[Highleyman]:Canthefailoverbescripted?
[LaPedis]: Scripts can be used to alter TCP/IP addresses and other network settings when
a switch is required, either on the NonStop servers or on the LAN. That is, routers and
switchescanbeusedtorerouteLANtrafficafteraswitchover withcompletetransparencyto
theendpoints.
[Highleyman]:Whataboutnonauditedfiles?
[LaPedis]: If both systems areontheTCP/IP network atthesametime,NonStop AutoSync
can be used in TCP/IP mode to duplicate whole files between the systems, as can
GoldenGatesoftwareforauditedandnonauditeddatabasefiles.
[Highleyman]: You talked about TMF earlier. Are there any special considerations with
respecttoTMF?
[LaPedis]: Yes. The TMF control and audit trail volumes as well as the data volumes are
defined on both systems but left disabled on the inactive system. TMF is also left in a down
state(obviously,sincetheTMFcontrolvolumeisononeoftheSANvolumes).

[LaPedis]: When the active system is to be brought down, the applications are either
stoppedinacontrolledmanner,whichispreferred,orthesystem canbecrashed(or,infact,
the system may have suffered a crash). TMF is then stopped either nicely or abruptly, and
the TMF control and data volumes are switched to the backup system and brought up.
When TMF is started, it will either immediately be ready, or it will start volume recovery.

[LaPedis]:Dependingontheapplication,thiscantakefromminutestohours.
[Highleyman]:Thathurts.Isthereanythingthatcanbedonetospeedupfailover?
[LaPedis]: One effective enhancement is to modifycustom applications so that theycan be
pre-started in the backup system. However, they remain inactive and depend upon a

[Highleyman]:Thanks,Ron,foryourtime.Andgoodluckinyournewlife.
