\"The routing layer that directs traffic from the internet to customer
dynos has an extremely slow memory leak that has existed for some time.
Typically, this memory leak has been mitigated by regular deploys of the
router. Recently, however, deploys to this component have been less
frequent. At some point, we crossed a tipping point and the memory leak
was no longer automatically remediated by ongoing deployments.\
\
This memory leak caused the processes in the routing layer to be killed
and restarted. During this period of the processes restarting, they were
unable to receive traffic and connections received EOF responses.\"

\"Degraded performance of one of our Cassandra database clusters caused
delays outside tolerance limits to the delivery of notifications and the
dispatching of webhooks. The degradation in performance was triggered
during the replacement of a failed virtual machine in the cluster. This
maintenance was unplanned, as the failure of the host was unexpected.\
\
The procedure used to replace the failed node triggered a chain reaction
of load on other nodes in the cluster, which hampered this cluster's
ability to do its primary job of processing notifications.\"
