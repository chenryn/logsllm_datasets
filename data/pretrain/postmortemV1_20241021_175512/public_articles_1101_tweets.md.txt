– Our January Twitter Feed of Outages
January2016
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass. With our new Twitter presence, we don’t have to feel
guilty.Thisarticlehighlightssomeofthetweetsthatmadeheadlinesinrecentdays.
Firstknownhacker-causedpoweroutagesignalstroublingescalation
Highly destructive malware that infected at least three regional power authorities in Ukraine led to a
power failure that left hundreds of thousands of homes without electricity in late December/early
January. According to antivirus provider ESET, the Ukrainian power authorities were infected using
booby-trapped macro functions embedded in Microsoft Office documents. If true, it's distressing that
industrial control systems used to supply power to millions of people could be infected using such a
simple social-engineering ploy. It's also concerning that malware is now being used to create power
failuresthatcanhavelife-and-deathconsequencesforlargenumbersofpeople.

UnderstandingthePromiseandPitfallsofMachineLearning
Machine learning is generating a tremendous amount of attention these days from the press as well
as the practitioners. And rightly so – machine learning is a transformative technology. But despite
the references to the topic, the money raised from venture capitalists, and the spotlight that Google
isbringing to thesubject,machinelearningisstill poorlyunderstood outsideofa coregroup ofhighly

Perhaps the greatest challenge of the algorithm revolution is that as machines and

‘Always-On’businesstobethenormfor2016
In 2016, the Internet of Things brings availability to the fore. The rise of mobile and connected
devices demonstrates that there is zero tolerance for downtime. Even a slight outage of a few hours
will cause everyone involved in the business to be unhappy that they don’t have access, but more
importantly, businesses will lose money, data, respect of employees, credibility from partners and
loyalty of customers, doing potential damage to consumer and investor confidence.

Stillcomingsoon:TheSEPTAKeytransitsmart-card
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania’s (USA) new SEPTA Key fare system, under which smart cards will
replace tokens and passes on public transit services throughout the city and its surrounding
counties, is to debut in 2016, about three years later than expected. The delays, depending upon to
whom you talk, are the result of the industry's immaturity in the United States, a lack of technical
know-how on SEPTA's part, and the speed at which technology is moving. SEPTA is short for
SoutheasternPennsylvaniaTransportationAuthority.

ITRecoveryAutomation:TheSolutiontoShortandLongTermOutages
Mention “IT outage,” and thoughts turn to super storms -- hurricanes, tornadoes or some other
natural disaster causing widespread havoc with your critical data. Typically, though, what causes a
data disruption is much more mundane. For instance, a power failure or a hardware glitch. Or (you
can’t make this up) a squirrel, a dropped anchor, or burning cigarette butt left in the wrong place.
They’re unusual, to be sure, but they still result in disruptions in IT operations.

Are organisations taking business continuity seriously? Apparently they are, but how they go about
handling disaster recovery is another matter. The difference is made in how companies manage
disaster recovery and business continuity and the emphasis they place on how time really matters
by putting solutions in place to ensure that a high level of uptime and network performance is
maintained.

FromtheDecemberAvailabilityDigest:"ApplyingPredictiveAnalyticstoPowerBackup"
In today’s data centers, protection from primary power outages is typically provided by backup
generators and UPS systems that supply power until the generator can be started and brought
online.Thefailure of a generatororaUPS system isone of themajorcausesof datacenteroutages.
Often, generatorsandUPS systemsaremonitored by extensive monitoring systems.However,most
of the data generated is unused for any actionable purposes. By analyzing the data in real time
using predictive analytics, actionable insights can be generated for intervention and maintenance

On December 22, 2015, the United States Patent and Trademark Office(USPTO) experienced a
catastrophic failure of electronic information systems. According to the USPTO, “Power that comes
into the USPTO’s main building feeds two power filtration systems that provide steady, “filtered”
power so systems don’t suffer from damaging surges or drops in power supply. A malfunction in the
power supply lines feeding these two systems caused significant damage to both systems. This is
