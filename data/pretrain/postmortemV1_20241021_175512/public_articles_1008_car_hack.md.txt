My Jeep Wasn’t Hacked!
August2015
Jeeps are being hacked! Apair of securityresearchers has demonstrated remotecontrol
of a Jeep by turning on its air conditioner and its radio, activating its windshield wipers,
and putting it in neutral while it is moving. They also can disable the brakes and control the steering and
theaccelerator.Fortunately,myJeepisnotoneofthoseaffected–itisjustacoupleofyearstooold.
In a recent Availability Digest article,1 we described a security researcher who was able to access a
plane’s flightcontrols viathein-flightentertainmentsystem inthecabin.Itturns outthatthecabinIntranet
network and the flight-control avionics Intranet network were linked by a firewall, which he was able to
breach.
Now this malicious technology has been extended to automobiles. Security researchers have
demonstratedthattheycantakecontrolofacar’scomputersbyaccessingthemviathecar’sinfotainment
(information andentertainment) center using acell phone from hundreds of miles away. Theinfotainment
center’s Intranet and the Intranet connecting the car’s computers are separated only by a firewall, which
theywereabletobreach.
The Jeep Grand Cherokee Hack
Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller have spent several years developing their car-hacking abilities. Today’s
cars often contain over fifty computers running 50 million lines of code. The hacker’s attack relies on the
car’s infotainment center that controls the car’s radio, music, navigation, and telephone capabilities. The
elements of the infotainment center are interconnected by an Intranet. This is the same Intranet that is
used by the car’s computers to communicate, though the Intranets of the infotainment system and the
car’scomputersareseparatedbyafirewall.
The researchers focused particularly on the Uconnect entertainment system used by Fiat Chrysler in
hundreds of thousands of their automobiles. After studying mechanical diagrams of a number of cars,
theysettledonJeepGrandCherokeesasaparticularlyvulnerablevehicle.
Uconnect receives information over Sprint’s 3G network. Uconnect controls the vehicle’s entertainment
and GPS navigation systems. It enables phone calls and even offers aWi-Fi hot spot. It allows control of
alloftheseservicesbyvoicecommands.
TheUconnectcellular connection to Sprintallows anyone whoknows thecar’s IP address to gainaccess
to the vehicle from anywhere in the country. The hackers were able to communicate with the Uconnect
system via a 3G cell phone. They discovered a service in Uconnect that enabled them to exploit a
vulnerabilitythatletthemputtheircodeintothefirmwareoftheentertainmentsystem.

From there, Valasek and Miller were able to communicate with and reprogram another chip that was
responsible for in-vehicle communications. They could then forge messages and send them to the car to
cause its computers to execute any number of actions. They could interact with the engine, steering,
transmission, or braking systems. They could control the air conditioner, the windshield wipers, the turn
signals,andtheradio.Inshort,theycouldcontrolthecarfromhundredsofmilesawaywithacellphone.
Of course, to do this, they needed to know the IP address of the car. To address this challenge, they
created a laptop program that can scan Sprint’s 3G network for cars with Uconnect systems. They
realized that theycould identifycars with a Uconnect system anywhere in the country. Theycould read a
car’sGPScoordinates,its vehicleidentificationnumber,itsmakeandmodel,anditsIPaddress.Withthis
information,theycouldselectacarandcontrolit.
A Wild Ride
To demonstrate that their work was real, Valasek and Miller subjected a journalist from Wired magazine
toawildride(seethearticlereferencedbelowandentitled”HackersRemotelyKillaJeepontheHighway

Working with the Manufacturers
Valasek and Miller worked closely with Fiat Chrysler while they were perfecting their hacking technique.
Theyalso involvedother manufacturers bysendingthem questionnaires abouttheir securitypractices.Of
the sixteen automakers who responded, all confirmed that virtually all of their vehicles have some sort of
wireless connection. Only seven of the companies said they hired independent security firms to test their
vehicles’ digital security. Only two said that their vehicles had monitoring systems that checked their
computernetworksformaliciousdigitalcommands.
Chrysler’s Recall
In response to this vulnerability, Fiat Chrysler has issued a safety recall affecting 1.4 million vehicles in
the United States. It issued a statement saying that exploiting the flaw “required unique and extensive
technical knowledge, prolonged access to a subject vehicle and extended periods of time to write code.”

Chrysler Fined for Inadequate Recalls
This is not the firstrecallbyFiat Chrysler. Infact,the U.S. National HighwayTraffic SafetyAdministration
(NHTSA) has criticized the companyfor its handling of 23 recalls involving 11 million vehicles. It points to
shortcomings in reporting defects and in inadequate recall procedures. As a consequence, Fiat Chrysler
hasbeenfinedUSD$105million.
The company has acknowledged violations of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act’s requirements to repair
safetydefects, and it has agreed to submit to rigorous federal oversight. The fine could be reduced if the
companyshowsgoodfaithincorrectingitsrecallissues.
Summary
The NHTSA is trying to determine how many car makers have received wireless components from the
same company that supplied Fiat Chrysler with Uconnect. They are making tests to determine how wide
thisvulnerabilitymightbe.
Furthermore, many other infotainment systems currently in use might present a similar vulnerability.
Among them are GM Onstar, Lexus Enform, Toyota Safety Connect, Hyundai Bluelink, and Infiniti
Connection.
Two U.S. senators have introduced a bill in Congress to call on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and
the NHTSA to set standards on vehicle safety. Included would be a security rating system for cars so
consumerswouldknowwhichonesworkedthehardesttomakeunhackableautomobiles.
Of course, the ultimate protection is to drop the use of the firewall and to use an air gap instead. Provide
