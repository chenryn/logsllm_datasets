ING Bank Down Ten Hours Due to Fire-Suppression Test
September2016
Fire-suppression testing strikes again. In 2010, WestHost, a major web-hosting
company, was taken down for days by a fire suppression test, the noise of which
damaged many of its hard disks.1 On Saturday, September 10, 2016, a similar test disabled an ING data
centerinBucharest,Romania,fortenhours.
It is common for data centers to use Inergen fire suppression systems, as the Inergen gas is non-
destructive to electronic equipment. However, the noise of the release of the Inergen gas is explosive.
Coupled with the noise of the sirens, the vibrations can generate hard-disk drive errors and in some
cases even damage the disks. During a recent test of its Inergen fire-suppression system, this is exactly
whathappenedtoING.IttookINGtenhourstobringitsdatacenterbackintooperation.
Inergen Fire-Suppression Systems
Inergen fire-suppression systems work by releasing Inergen gas into the computer room. Inergen gas
comprises 52% nitrogen, 40% argon, and 8% carbon dioxide. The normal air that we breathe contains
21%oxygenand79%nitrogen.
In the event of a fire in a data-center room, enough Inergen gas is released to cause a 40% to 50%
concentration of Inergen in the computer-room’s air supply. This reduces the oxygen content in the data
center room to 10% to 15%. This is a safe level for humans and allows time for data-center personnel to
safely evacuate the data center. However, this level of oxygen is insufficient to support combustion.
Therefore,theinjectionofInergenintothecomputer-roomairextinguishesthefire.
Unfortunately,theInergengasisreleasedrapidlythroughnozzles locatedthroughoutthecomputerroom.
This rapid release of gas generates a great deal of noise. In addition, the fire sirens in the room add
additional noise. There have been several incidents in which hard disk drives (HDDs) have been
damagedduringtestingofInergenfire-suppressionsystems.
Tests by Tyco, the manufacturer of Inergen, and by Siemans, the manufacturer of the fire-suppression
systems, have determined that it is neither the Inergen gas nor the increased pressure from the gas that
causes the disk damage. Rather, the HDD damage is caused by the noise generated from the gas
discharge along withtheaccompanying noise of the warningsirens.In particular, thehighdecibel levelof
the noise, coupled with the high-frequency content of the gas discharge and the sirens, causes the disks
togenerateerrorsand,insomecases,tobedamaged.

The ING Bank Fire-Suppression Test
On Saturday, September 10, 2016, personnel in ING’s Bucharest, Romania, data center performed their
yearly fire-extinguisher test. Their system is an Inergen system, and the test involved activating the
systemandfloodingthedatacenterwithInergengas.
The pressure of the gas was higher than expected, and its discharge created an explosive din much
larger than ING had experienced in previous tests. The clamor exceeded the capability of the bank’s
noise-measuring equipment, which topped out at 130 decibels. 130 decibels is equivalent to being fifty
feet away from a jet aircraft taking off from an aircraft carrier with afterburner. The noise destroyed
dozensofharddiskdrives.

The bank’s website was knocked offline by the outage. Several financial transactions were affected over
the weekend. ING’s ability to notify customers about the situation was hampered by its email and text

Why Are Hard Disks So Affected?
Sound is vibrations sent through the air. These vibrations cause the HDD cases to start to vibrate. The
vibration is transmitted to the disk’s read/write heads, causing them to go off their data tracks.The heads
canalsovibrateupanddown,scratchingthedisksurface.Ifthishappens,thediskisdestroyed.
According to IBM, an HDD can tolerate less than one-millionth of an inch offset from the center of a data
track. Earlier disk technology had much greater spacing. That is why these fire-suppression test failures
areonlynowbeingseen.
This effect is graphically illustrated in an amusing YouTube video, “Shouting in the Data Center,”2 in
which a technician cups his hands and yells at disks. Monitoring software graphically shows the

Best Practices
There are several steps that a company can take to avoid the consequences of a fire-suppression test
gonewrong:
 Selectlesssensitivedrivesorsolid-statedisks.
 Encloseharddisksinnoise-protectedenclosures.
 Replicatecriticaldatatooff-sitedisks(on-sitebackupdiskscanbedamaged).
 Selectsirenandgasnozzlelocationsthatdonotradiatedirectlyonthediskdrives.
 Muzzlethesirensduringfire-extinguishertests.
 Increase the number and decrease the spacing of suppression nozzles to decrease their sound
levels.
 Avoidveryshortdischargetimes.
 De-energizeequipmentandletthedisksparkthemselvesbeforethetest.

Summary
The activation of a fire-suppression system can create enough noise to seriously damage the servers’
hard disk drives in the computer room. It is one thing to damage disks in a real fire with noise, as they
