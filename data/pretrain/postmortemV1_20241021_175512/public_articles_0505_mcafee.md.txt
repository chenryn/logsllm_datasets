Anti-Virus – A Single Point of Failure?
May2010
What do active/active systems, clusters, fault-tolerant systems, and standby systems have in
common?Theyall avoid a singlepoint of failure. True,fault-tolerantsystems andclusters will not
survive a site failure; and standby systems have been known not to come up when needed. But
active/activesystemsareimmune,right?
OnApril 21st, McAfee, one of the leading antivirus vendors,provedthis conjectureto be wrong. It
sentoutan antivirus updatethatimmediatelytook downhundreds of thousands –maybemillions
– of computers worldwide. This one bad update could have stopped every node in an
active/active system, and our “indestructible system” would have been destroyed – a single point
offailure.

What Went Wrong?
svchost.exe
On every PC is a very critical executable – svchost.exe. svchost.exe is a generic process that
runsdynamiclinklibraries(DLLs)assignedtoit.
Sometimeago,MicrosoftmovedfunctionalityforWindows services out of dedicated executables
to DLLs to improve reusability. But a DLL cannot be directly executed. It must be linked to a
process that will execute it. Hence, svchost.exe. DLLs are packaged into groups associated with
a certain service, such as network management, the firewall, and the user interface. Each group
is assigned to an instance of svchost.exe responsible for executing those DLLs. Look on your
Windowscomputer,andyouwillseemanyinstancesofsvchost.exerunning.
Clearly, svchost.exe is fundamental to the operation of a PC system. A Windows system cannot
evenbootupifsvchost.exeisabsent.
TheBotchedUpdate
Antivirus vendors, such as McAfee, Symantic (Norton), and AVG, are under increasing pressure
due to the rate of creation of new virus attacks. It is reported that Symantic issues its Pulse
updates every five to fifteen minutes to try to beat a virus to systems in the field. To avoid
infection, time is so critical that updates are propagated automaticallyand usually take effect in a
systemwithoutuseractionorknowledge.

But anyupdatemustbethoroughlytestedtoensurethat it is proper and willdo nodamageitself.
In Microsoft systems, there are a multitude of versions ofWindows that must be tested before an
update can be released. However, the longer that testing takes place, the more likely it is that
systems will be infected. Thus, there is a real trade-off between testing and effectiveness of an
upgrade.McAfeehas7,000employees,mostworkingunderthisstress.
OnApril 21st,the McAfee team was racing to propagatean update to its users to defeat a variant
of theW32/Wecorl virus. This virus attempts to attach itself to the svchost.exe file to gain control
ofasystem wheneverthesvchost.exefileisexecutedasaprocess.Itisoneofmanyvirusesthat
attack the svchost.exe file. McAfee propagates its updates as DAT files. DAT file 5958 contained
the fix and was sent to all McAfee customers on April 21st. On most systems, the update was
installedautomaticallyandimmediately.
The problem was that this update erroneously identified every running instance of the
svchost.exe process as being infected. It therefore either quarantined the svchost.exe file or
deleteditfromdisk.Itthenautomaticallyrebootedthecomputertoeffectuatetheupdate.
TheConsequences
The consequences were disastrous.Without svchost.exe, PCs could not boot up. They went into
acontinuousrebootcycle.
If a user acted fast enough, he could trap the reboot and bring the PC up in safe mode. But then
what? He could discover that he had no access to the network and that even his USB port was
probablynotworking.ThePCwaseffectivelyisolatedfromtherestoftheworld.
McAfee quickly came up with a fix that it distributed in an emergency DAT – the EXTRA.DAT
update. All users had to do was to download EXTRA.DAT and send it over their networks to fix
the compromised PCs. The only problem was that there was no network access. Even if an
unaffected computer could download EXTRA.DAT, it could not distribute it over a company’s
internalnetworktothefailedcomputers.
To compound the matter even further, McAfee’s support web site went down under extraordinary
load; and many couldn’t even get to the update fix. McAfee sent out a notice that said, “The
McAfeeCommunityisexperiencingunusuallylargetrafficwhichmaycauseslowpageloads.”
McAfee then published (again on their overloaded support site) other fix suggestions. All a user
had to do was to unquarantine the quarantined svc.host file to return it to service (this could be
done in safe mode). If the file had instead been deleted, the user could copy it from a good
systemtothefailedsystem.Theproblemwiththedeleted-filemethodwasthatitrequiredcopying
the file from a good system onto a USB flash drive and then loading the file from the flash drive
onto the bad system.ButtheUSB portonthebadsystem was likelynot tobeoperational,so the
copycouldnotbeperformed.
Early the next day, McAfee made available a semi-automated repair tool dubbed SuperDAT
Remediation Tool. It was available from the network, but it was of no use to customers who had
nonetworkaccess.

The Scope of the Disaster
As it turned out, the bad update affected only Windows XP Service Pack 3. In an apology,
McAfeesaidthat onlyone-half of onepercentof allcorporateusers were affected;andalmostno
consumers were affected. However, the blogs and comments on McAfee’s web site told a
different story. A Gartner Group analyst stated that Windows XP SP3 has over 50% of the
corporatemarket.OnecommentontheMcAfeewebsitesaid:
“How the hell am Isupposed to sign up for Support Notification Service if I can’t even access
myInternet?ThisisHORRIBLE.WheredoIsignupfortheHUGEclassactionlawsuit?Iwas
on the phone over 3 hours yesterday with this issue. The first time I called, you wanted to
chargeme$89.50tofixyourproblem!Also,Ihadtwodifferenttechiessaytheywouldcallme
back.Guesswhat?Theyneverdid!”
McAfee’s apology also stated that “the problem could result in moderate to significant
performanceissues.”Continualrebootingisamoderatetosignificantperformanceissue?
From a crisis management and public relations viewpoint, McAfee’s response was disastrous.
McAfee downplayed the seriousness of the problem in their “apology.” As of April 23rd, two days
later, there was still no statement, apology, or clearly labeled link to support resources related to
thisissueonMcAfee’shomepage.

How Did This Happen?
McAfee has yet to explain in any detail how this update got released to its customers. However,
Ed Bott of ZDNet claims to have been given a confidential copy of a McAfee release that was
neverpublished.Inthisrelease,theauthorsaid:
“Some specific steps of the existing Quality Assurance processes were not followed.
Standard peer review of the driver was not done. … There was inadequate coverage … in
thetestsystemsused.Specifically,XPSP3…wasnotincludedinthetestconfiguration…”
In its haste to get the update out, McAfee purportedly bypassed testing it onWindows XP SP3 –

Lessons Learned
This was a nightmare scenario - an automatic update that wiped out a crucial system file on
hundredsofthousands ofcomputersandwhichcould onlyberepairedmanually. However,this is
notthefirsttimethatthishashappened:
 Inthepreviousmonth,aBitDefenderupdatetookdown64-bitWindowssystems.
 InMayof 2007, aSymantic definitionfilecrippledthousands of Chinesecomputers when
itmistooktwocriticalWindowsDLLfilesasmalware.
This is bound to happen again. What should we do to protect ourselves from the problem? One
bloggerputitsuccinctly:
“All this negativity. Evenif this slippedpastMcAfee,shouldn’teverybodybetestingtheir DAT
files in their own lab environment? I test everyone of mine in a VM lab environment to make
surenothingbadcancomeoutofissuinganewDATglobally.”
For critical enterprise systems, don’t rush to automatically apply updates of any kind (antivirus,
operating system, utilities, application fixes). Test them first in a safe environment, roll them out
slowly one system at a time, or wait to see if problems are reported by others. For those with
individualPCs,dothelatter–waitadayorsotoseeifproblemsarereported.
By doing so, you may be opening yourself up to a higher probability of infection. But with proper
firewalls, opening only trusted emails, and visiting only proper web sites, this probability is pretty
small. Besides, an infection is probably more easily corrected than is a computer that is totally
wipedout.
