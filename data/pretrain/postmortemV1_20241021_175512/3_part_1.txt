Post Incident Review (PIR) - Canonical Ubuntu issue impacted VMs and AKS

Tracking ID: 2TWN-VT0


**What happened?**

Between 06:00 UTC on 30 Aug 2022 and 16:00 UTC on 31 Aug 2022, customers
running Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic) Virtual Machines (VMs) who had Ubuntu
Unattended-Upgrades enabled received a systemd version that resulted in
Domain Name System (DNS) resolution errors. This issue was confined to
Ubuntu version 18.04, but impacted all Azure regions including public
and sovereign clouds.

Downstream Azure services that rely on impacted Ubuntu VMs also
experienced impact during this window -- including Azure Kubernetes
Service (AKS), Azure Monitor, Application Insights, Log Analytics and
Microsoft Sentinel. AKS customers could have experienced pod creation
errors such as ImagePullBackoff as kubelet was unable to resolve DNS
names of container registry. Customers may have experienced an inability
to access Azure Monitor, Application Insights, Log Analytics, and/or
Microsoft Sentinel log data, and may have noticed missed or delayed Log
Search alerts and/or Microsoft Sentinel alerts.

**What went wrong, and why?**

At 06:00 UTC on 30 August 2022, a Canonical Ubuntu security update was
published -- so Azure VMs running Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic) with
unattended-upgrade enabled started to download and install the new
packages, including systemd version 237-3ubuntu10.54. This led to a loss
of their DNS configurations due to a race-condition bug:
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1988119](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1988119).

The manifestation of this bug was triggered due to the combination of
this and a previous update. This bug only affects systems using a driver
name to identify the proper Network Interface Card (NIC) in their
network configuration, which is why this issue impacted Azure uniquely
and not other major cloud providers. This resulted in DNS resolution
failures and network connectivity issues for Azure VMs running Ubuntu
18.04 (bionic). As a result, other services dependent on these VMs were
impacted by the same DNS resolution issues.

When unattended-upgrades are enabled, security updates are automatically
downloaded and applied once per day by default. Considering their
criticality, security updates like these do not go through our Safe
Deployment Practices (SDP) process. However, we are reviewing this
process to ensure that we minimize customer impact during incidents like
these.

**How did we respond?**

Multiple Azure teams detected the issue shortly after the packages were
published via production alerts, including our AKS and Azure Container
Apps service teams. Upon investigation, we identified the root cause as
the bug in Ubuntu mentioned above, and began engaging other teams to
explore appropriate mitigations. During this time, incoming customer
support cases describing the issue validated that the issues were
limited to the Ubuntu versions described above.

There were multiple mitigation and remediation steps, several of which
were completed in partnership with Canonical / Ubuntu:

-   This bug and a potential fix have been highlighted on the Canonical
    / Ubuntu website, which we encouraged impacted customers to read
    (linked above).
-   For impacted Azure VM instances, we recommended that customers
    reboot the VM(s) or, if reboot was not an option, run a script to
    fix it. Azure provided a template script but encouraged customers to
    test and modify the script as needed before applying:
    [https://github.com/mcgov/az_scripts/blob/main/az_fix_dns_resolve.sh](https://github.com/mcgov/az_scripts/blob/main/az_fix_dns_resolve.sh).
-   For the impact to AKS nodes, our AKS team developed an automatic
    detection and remediation solution then rolled this out across all
    regions. This resolved the vast majority of customers, others
    required manual mitigations through support.
-   Additional downstream impact to other services was addressed through
    similar remediation steps to address the bug in their specific
    Ubuntu version, so some of these services recovered prior to the
    final mitigation time above.

**How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?**

Already completed:

-   Improved monitoring of AKS data plane for alerts on the uptick of
    errors.
-   Reviewed AKS monitoring algorithms to help ensure detection and
    alerting upon similar VM errors that were experienced in this
    scenario.
-   Established an improved escalation path to Canonical during outages
    and include that in our internal Technical Service Guides (TSGs).

Short term:

-   AKS will take full control over the security patch mechanism, versus
    shared control with Canonical today. This includes additional
    testing and controlled release of these patches done directly by
    AKS. (Estimated completion: December 2022).

Medium term:

-   For IaaS VMs, we are working to engage with Canonical to run
    dedicated tests on proposed packages before they are published for
    Azure users.

Longer-term:

-   AKS will establish a process with Canonical to close the testing gap
    for the upgrade scenario. (Estimated completion: March 2023).
-   AKS will provide customers with maintenance window control and
    environment staging for these patches when they are deemed safe to
    release. (Estimated completion: December 2023).

**How can our customers and partners make incidents like this less
impactful?**

-   AKS customers can ensure their nodes are up to date and exclusively
    leveraging Microsoft's supply chain by using automatic node image
    upgrade:
    [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/auto-upgrade-cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/auto-upgrade-cluster).
-   For IaaS VMs, customers can choose to configure VMs to use the
    following service to get Ubuntu patches here:
    [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching).
    This service will limit the blast radius of VMs seeing the patches
    from Ubuntu and do an orchestrated update of the VMs. The service
    also provides health monitoring and to detect issues, users can
    provide app health signals through app health extension. Please
    refer to:
    [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-health-extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-health-extension).

Post Incident Review (PIR) - Datacenter power event - West US 2

Tracking ID: MMXN-RZ0


*Watch our \'Azure Incident Retrospective\' video about this incident:
[https://aka.ms/AIR/MMXN-RZ0](https://aka.ms/AIR/MMXN-RZ0)*

**What happened?**

[Between 02:47 UTC on 27 Aug 2022 and 02:00 UTC on 28 Aug 2022, a subset
of customers experienced failures when trying to access resources hosted
in the West US 2 region. Although initially triggered by a utility power
outage that affected all of our datacenters in the region, the vast
majority of our backup power systems performed as designed to prevent
impact. Failures of a small number of backup power systems led to
customer impact in two datacenters. Most customers were recovered by
07:00 UTC on 27 Aug 2022, but small subsets of resources required manual
recovery -- with the final set being brought back online by 02:00 UTC on
28 Aug 2022.]{style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51)"}

[During this impact window, several downstream Azure services that were
dependent on impacted infrastructure also experienced issues --
including Storage, Virtual Machines, App Services, Application Insights,
Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Red Hat OpenShift, Azure Search,
Azure SQL DB, Backup, Data Explorer, ExpressRoute, and NetApp
Files. ]{style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51)"}

**What went wrong, and why?**

On August 27 at 02:47 UTC, we identified a power event that caused
impact to a number of storage and compute scale units in the West US 2
region. The West US 2 region is made up of 10+ datacenters, spread
across three Availability Zones on multiple campuses. During this event,
the whole region experienced a utility power outage, impacting all
datacenters in the region. A failure on major distribution lines caused
at least two substations to lose power. That resulted in loss of utility
power across a broad area that included all three Availability Zones in
the West US 2 region.

In all datacenters except two, our backup power systems performed as
designed, transitioning all infrastructure to run briefly on batteries
and then on generator power. But in two separate datacenters, two unique
but unrelated issues occurred that prevented some of the servers in each
datacenter from transitioning to generator power. Since these two
datacenters were in two different Availability Zones, customers may have
been impacted by both.

In the first datacenter, impact was caused when a small number of server
rack level Uninterruptible Power Supply (RUPS) systems failed to stay
online during the transition to generator, creating a momentary loss of
power to the servers. These servers were immediately re-energized once
backup generators started and supported the load.

In the second datacenter, several Primary UPS systems (approximately 12%
of the total UPS systems in the datacenter) failed to support the load
during the transition to generator, due to UPS battery failures. As a
result, the downstream servers lost power until the UPS faults could be
cleared and put back online with utility supply.

The initial trigger to this event was when a high voltage static wire
(used to help protect transmission lines against lightning strikes)
failed. When the static wire failed, it created a voltage surge on the
230kV lines, causing breakers at two substations (approximately 30 miles
apart) within the utility power grid to open. The root cause of the
static wire failures is still under investigation by the utility
provider. 

**How did we respond?**

This event was first detected by our EPMS (Electrical Power Monitoring
System) in West US 2, which in turn notified our datacenter team of the
utility loss issue, and then of equipment failure issues. While the vast
majority of datacenters transitioned to backup power without issue, two
specific datacenters experienced different UPS issues described above
that prevented a full transition to backup power sources.

Due to the nature of this event, the team followed our Emergency
Operations Procedure (EOP) to manually restore Mechanical, Electrical,
Plumbing (MEP) equipment to its operational state. Once the MEP was
returned to an operational state, the racks began to recover. The Public
Utility Department (PUD) was able to close their breakers and restore
utility power to our datacenters by 03:48 UTC. This enabled the
datacenter teams to begin the recovery of the affected equipment and
restoration of power to the impacted racks. By 04:46 UTC, power was
fully restored to all affected racks, and services continued their
recovery.

Four Azure Storage scale units were impacted by the power loss (one
Standard, two Premium, one Ultra Disk scale unit) resulting in the data
hosted on these becoming inaccessible until power was restored and the
scale units recovered to healthy states. The Standard Storage scale unit
was fully available by 07:45 UTC, although the vast majority of clients
would have seen availability restored by 06:05 UTC. The two Premium
Storage scale units were restored by 0510 UTC. Due to a software bug
(the fix for which is already in our deployment pipeline) a small subset
of disk requests (\<0.5%) may have encountered further errors through
07:30 UTC. Due to a combination of hardware failures and software bugs,
the Ultra Disk scale unit was not fully available until 21:40 UTC on
8/28. The majority of the data (\> 99.9%) was available by 05:15 UTC on
08/27.

Impacted Azure compute scale sets were brought back online -- mostly
automatically after storage recovered, but a subset of infrastructure
and customer VMs required manual mitigations to ensure they came back
online successfully. VMs that were using the Trusted Launch feature, in
particular, did not automatically recover and required engineering team
intervention to restore -- all of these VMs were restored to a
functional state by 00:20 UTC on 8/28. 

**How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?**

Already completed:

-   We have completed detailed inspections on our generator systems and
    all generators are in good operating condition. 
-   UPS systems have been inspected and all components are operating and
    functioning per design specifications. This inspection highlighted
    that battery replacement is required.
-   After reviewing the entire line up, batteries have been replaced in
    the UPS units that experienced failures.

Short term:

-   Complete deployment of the Storage software fix for the bug that
    caused a small tail of errors following Premium Storage scale unit
    recovery.
-   Complete deployment of the software fix for the trusted VM feature,
    which caused some VMs not to come back online automatically after
    storage recovery.

Longer term:

-   We are working on several platform, telemetry, and process
    improvements that will reduce Ultra Disk replica recovery time.
-   We are improving our VM migration times to healthy hosts for faster
    recovery. This includes telemetry improvements to identify long
    running/stuck migration operations to identify issues more quickly.
-   Microsoft uses multiple equipment vendors and designs -- findings
    will be reviewed against our global fleet and, where necessary,
    applied beyond the impacted datacenters.
-   Process failure mode effects analysis (PFMEA) review of the
    processes utilized during the event, applying lessons learned and
    improving our methodology. This includes assessing human touch
    points, working to engineer out or automate systems for smoother
    transition or recovery. Findings will also be applied to our
    Tabletop/GameDay exercises, ensuring team members are familiar and
    prepared to respond.

**How can customers and partners make incidents like this less
impactful?**

-   While Availability Zones are designed in ways to reduce correlated
    failures, they can still occur. We encourage customer and partner
    Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plans to include the
    ability to failover between regions, in case of a region-wide
    incident. While the likelihood of failure decreases with the
    magnitude of the failure, it never goes to zero:
    [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/availability-zones/cross-region-replication-azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/availability-zones/cross-region-replication-azure)
-   Consider which are the right Storage redundancy options for your
    critical applications. Geo-redundant storage (GRS) enables account
    level failover in case the primary region endpoint becomes
    unavailable:
    [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy)
-   More generally, consider evaluating the reliability of your
    applications using guidance from the Azure Well-Architected
    Framework and its interactive Well-Architected Review:
    [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency)
-   Finally, consider ensuring that the right people in your
    organization will be notified about any future service issues - by
    configuring Azure Service Health alerts. These can trigger emails,
    SMS, push notifications, webhooks, and more:
