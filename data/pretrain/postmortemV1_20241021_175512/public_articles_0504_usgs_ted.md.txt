The Twitter Earthquake Detector
April2010
It can take many minutes for an earthquake to be scientifically reported, but social networks can
reduce this time to seconds. The U.S. Geological Survey, which has responsibility in the U.S. for
earthquake detection and reporting, is building a prototype to take advantage of social Internet
technology to speed up early reporting of earthquake activity. It is parsing tweets sent by Twitter
users to find out about earthquakes in the seconds after the tremors begin. It calls this new
systemtheTwitterEarthquakeDetector(TED).
U.S. Geological Service
DrivenbytheneedtoinventorythevastlandsacquiredbytheUnited
States after the Louisiana Purchase and the Mexican-AmericanWar,
theUnitedStatesGeologicalSurvey(USGS) wascreatedin1879.1It
was charged with the “classification of the public lands and
examination of the geological structure, mineral resources, and
productsofthenationaldomain."
A bureau of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the USGS is a scientific agency with no
regulatory responsibility. USGS scientists study the landscape of the United States, its natural
resources, and the natural hazards that threaten it. The USGS supports four major scientific
disciplines–biology,geography,geology,andhydrology.
Its Earthquake Hazards Program monitors earthquake activity worldwide. The Colorado-based
Earthquake Information Center detects the location and magnitude of global earthquakes and
informs authorities, emergency responders, the media, and the public, both domestic and
worldwide,aboutsignificantearthquakeactivity.
Twitter
Twitter is a very popular worldwide microblogging service2 that allows its users to send text-
message “tweets” comprising up to 140 characters. The receipt of tweets can be limited to the
“followers”ofthesender,ortheymaybeopentweetsavailabletoall.

However, even as the tremors are occurring, the Twitter network is alive with first-hand accounts
of the shaking. These tweets can get through even if voice communication channels are
overloaded.
The USGS has recognized that tweets are a valuable source of information, unscientific though
they may be, and is experimenting with adding first-hand accounts of shaking to its suite of
seismically-derived information. It has initiated a prototype project that automatically monitors

The USGS can summarize and map pertinent tweets to get an early indication of suspected
earthquakeactivity.Themappingrapidlydetermines theareaof an earthquakethathas beenfelt
by people, and this data can subsequently be linked to the scientifically-derived seismic
information. The USGS attaches a summary of the cities where tweets originated and the text of
thefirstseveraltweets to its earthquakealerts that providethemeasuredlocation andmagnitude
of the earthquake. In this sense, tweet information augments but does not replace scientific
information.

Summary
The USGS has realized that social networking can produce more than simply “short bursts of
inconsequential information.” Immediate responses by observers over a social network can be
mined to provide early reports of many disasters, from earthquakes, fires and accidents to

software”).
