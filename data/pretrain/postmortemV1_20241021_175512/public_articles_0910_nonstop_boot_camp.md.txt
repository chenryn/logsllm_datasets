2014 HP NonStop Technical Boot Camp
October2014
It’s that time again for the premier HP NonStop conference. Hosted by Connect, the
Independent HP Business Technology Community (http://www.connect-community.org/),
the 2014 HP NonStop Technical Boot Camp will be held from Sunday, November 16th,
through Wednesday, November 19th, at the Hayes Mansion in San Jose, California. The NonStop Boot
Camp follows the successful Connect OpenVMS Boot Camp held in Bedford, Massachusetts, from
September28ththroughOctober1st.
This is the 40thanniversary of NonStop servers (affectionately
stillknownasTandem computers).NonStopserversarefault-
tolerant systems with dual everythings. Every component
(hardware and software) is duplicated at least once in the
system with instant failover should a fault occur. The systems
employ a shared-nothing architecture that isolates every
component from every other so that a failure in any one
component does not affectother components.Loosecoupling
amongcomponentsisachievedviaahighlyefficientmessagingsystem.1
Field experience has shown NonStop-server average failure intervals to be measured in years. In
active/active systems, in which two or more active nodes share the application work load, NonStop

Of particular interest this year will be information on HP’s port of the NonStop operating system to its x86
blades. NonStop will soon be able to run in either an x86 environment or in an Itanium environment.
