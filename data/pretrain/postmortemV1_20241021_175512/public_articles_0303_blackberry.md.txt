BlackBerry Takes Another Dive
March2008
Déjàvu.Ithappenedagain.It was less thana year agothat the BlackBerryemail network of RIM
(Research in Motion) went down, and it took days to work through the backlog of email that had
builtupduringthehalf-dayoutage.1
Just last month, email and Internet service again disappeared from the screens of millions of
BlackBerrys in North America and Canada. Again, it was over a day before RIM’s email service
workedofftheresultingbacklogandreturnedtonormal.
The BlackBerry outage in April of 2007 was caused by a software upgrade that had not been
properly tested. RIM management said that this would never happen again. Guess what? The
outage in February, 2008, was caused by a software upgrade that had not been properly tested.
Willtheyeverlearn?
Research in Motion and the BlackBerry Success Story
BlackBerrys are handheld “smart phones.” Not onlydo theyserve as cell
phones, but they also send and receive email messages and provide
access to the Internet, among other features. They have become a
perceived necessity for bankers, lawyers, journalists, lawmakers,
businesspeople,andanyoneelsewhofeelsthathehastobeconnected
while“onthego.”
The BlackBerrynetwork was created and is managed by RIM (Research
in Motion, of Ontario, Canada). RIM is the developer and owner of the
BlackBerry technology, though it perhaps is not the inventor, as
evidenced by a patent lawsuit it recently lost. Its email network
comprises two Network Operating Centers (NOCs), one in Canada and
one in the UK. The Canadian NOC serves subscribers in North America
and parts of Asia, and the UK NOC serves subscribers in the UK,
Europe,theMiddleEast,andAsia.
Each NOC acts as a hub, receiving BlackBerry email messages from corporate and ISP email
servers, encrypting them, and pushing them to other BlackBerrys over the cellular networks and
to other email servers over the Internet. Thus, BlackBerry subscribers can exchange email
directlywithotherBlackBerrysandcansendandreceiveemailtoandfromemailservers.
The BlackBerry service has expanded rapidly. The number of BlackBerry users has tripled over

Down in April, 2007
Over the years, RIM has had its share of BlackBerry hiccups but nothing terribly serious. All of
this changed on Tuesday evening, April 17, 2007. On that day, at 8 pm EDT, BlackBerry
messagesstoppedflowingtosubscribersinNorthAmerica.
ByWednesday morning, the system had been returned to service; but it had to deal with a huge
backlog of emails that had accumulated during the outage. These emails started to trickle out
Wednesday morning, but new emails that came in entered the end of the queue and were
delayedforhours.ItwasnotuntilThursdaythatoperationsreturnedtonormal.
Once operations normalized, RIM management began to release details of the outage. They
reported that the outage was triggered by the “introduction of a new, noncritical system routine”
designedtooptimizecacheperformance.Theyhadnotexpectedthischangetoaffecttheregular
operationsofBlackBerry.
However, despite previous testing, the new system routine set off an unexpected chain reaction.
It triggered a series of interaction errors between the system’s operational database and cache
andresultedinatemporaryoutageuntilthebackupsystemcouldbebroughtonline.
After the RIM technicians isolated the database problem and tried unsuccessfully to fix it, they
began the failover process to the backup system. But horrors of horrors, the failover attempt
failed,despitefailoverhavingbeenpreviouslytested.
Clearly, RIM’s testing proved to be insufficient. RIM management stated that it had identified
several deficiencies in its testing, monitoring, and recovery processes and promised that these
processes would be enhanced to prevent a recurrence of the incident. RIM’s co-chief executive
officer said that such disruptions were very rare and pledged that the company would prevent
suchaservicefailurefromhappeningagain.
Down Again in February, 2008
But such a failure did happen again.2 On Monday, February 11, at 3:30 pm EST, Verizon, Sprint
Nextel,andAT&T werenotifiedofa“criticalseverityoutage” inRIM’s emailandInternetservices.
About half of all North American users – about four million subscribers – suddenly found their
emailscreensempty.
During the April, 2007, outage, RIM was severely criticized for not informing their subscribers as
to what had happened and what the prognosis was. This time, RIM sent out a message to its
largeclients,saying:
“ThisisanemergencynotificationregardingthecurrentBlackberryinfrastructureoutage.

also be unable to register their device, roam in another location, or use other services

Theonlyproblemwasthat thismessagewassentoutbyemail!Howironic!
The BlackBerry system was down for three hours. The good news was that voice and SMS (text
messaging) services were unaffected. The bad news was that it was not until the next day that
the backlog of email messages dissipated and that service returned to normal. The backlog was
aggravated by the millions of messages that read something like “Subject: Test. Body: Test Test
TestCanyouhearmenow?”
The Post Mortem
For redundancy purposes, RIM provides to its North American NOC two paths represented by
twoIPaddresses.TheemailserversofRIMclientsaresplitbetweenthesepaths.
Early tests seemed to indicate that one of the IP paths was refusing connection requests. It was
the RIM clients using that path who experienced the outage. Clients using the working path
experiencedlittleornoserviceinterruption.
However, at this time, RIM offered no explanation of what had happened. They only said that it
“continuestofocusonprovidingindustry-leadingreliabilityinitsproductsandservices”
Subsequently, RIM announced that the outage was due to an internal data routing system within
the BlackBerry service infrastructure. The routing system had recently been upgraded and had
misbehaved.Onceagain,anupgradethatseemsnottohavebeenproperlytestedtook downthe
BlackBerrysystem.
RIMwentontosaythat“theupgradewaspartofRIM’sroutineongoingeffortstoincreaseoverall
capacity for longer term growth. RIM continuously increases the capacity of its infrastructure in
advance of longer term demand. Similar upgrades have been successfully implemented in the
past, but there appears to be a problem with this particular upgrade that caused the intermittent
servicedelays.”
Are You a “CrackBerry” Addict?
The addictive nature of BlackBerrys has led them jokingly to be called “CrackBerrys.” Are you a
CrackBerry? Over a year ago, in December, 2006, after consulting with a time-management
expert, professors, and therapists who specialize in family training and obsessive-compulsive
disorder,KatherineRosmancameupwiththefollowingrulestocontrolyouraddiction:3

Lessons Learned

UpgradesCanBeHazardousToYourSystem
Upgrades to applications, operating systems, databases, hardware, networks, or any other
component of your system are to be feared. No matter how careful you are, something can (and
oftenwill)gowrong.
The first rule, of course, is to thoroughly test the upgrade before installing it. Most of us do that
verywell.However,whatwedon’toftendoistoprepareacontingencyplan.Whatdowedoifthe
upgradedoesn’tworkorifitcausesunanticipatedproblems?Howarewegoingtoundoit?
Oh! If we only had an Undo button, but we don’t. If we are concerned about availability, one way
to quickly back out an upgrade is to take advantage of our system redundancy which we surely
have (don’t we?). Run the upgrade in one system and be prepared to immediately switch over to
theothersystemiftheupgradegivesaproblem.
EvenInfrastructureNeedsBackups
BlackBerry service is becoming part of the critical infrastructure that many of us depend upon. In
many cases we have backups for infrastructure failures. We expect our power to be always
available, but we are smart enough to provide UPS backup systems and motor-generators to
carryusoverintheeventofapoweroutage.
We also expect to get a dial tone whenever we pick up the telephone handset. A couple of
decades ago, we had no recourse if the telephone went dead. Fortunately, now we do. It is our
cellphone.

Can the Internet go down? Not likely, given its multipath redundancy with automatic rerouting
around failures. But it can happen, and it has. In December, 2006, a massive earthquake broke
Internet connections between Southeast Asia and the rest of the world. It took over seven weeks
torepair thedamage.Justlastmonth,inJanuary, 2008,cables connectingtheMideastandIndia
to Europe and the Eastern United States were severed, disrupting Internet service for days.4 Are
you prepared for such a catastrophe? Do you have agreements in place for satellite backup
channels?
Now we find that even at the personal level we should have backup contingency plans. What do
we do if our BlackBerry suddenly goes dead for hours or days? It is time to think about that and
