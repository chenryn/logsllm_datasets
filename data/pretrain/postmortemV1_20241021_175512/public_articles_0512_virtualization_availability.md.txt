Leveraging Virtualization for Availability
December2010
Virtualized environments are becoming commonplace in today’s data centers. Since manyvirtual
servers can be hosted on a single physical server, the server count in the data center along with
the associated savings in floor space, energy, and administration can reduce the server
componentcostinadatacenterby80%ormore.
However, if a server should fail, not one but many applications are taken down. Availability is a
critical issue in a virtualized environment. Fortunately, there are several ways to provide high
availabilityintheseenvironments.Inprinciple,evencontinuousavailabilitycanbeachieved.
What is Virtualization?
Until recently, it has been the practice in many data centers to have a separate server for each
application. After all, a business-unit manager did not want to share his server with other
applications that he could not control. Who knows what bugs lay in the applications of others or
whathorribleperformancehitstheymightimpose?
However,as theseservers wereupgradedtomorepowerfulservers over the years,theybecame
less and less loaded. In many data centers today, it is not uncommon to find that the Windows,
Linux, and UNIX servers in the data center are running at only 10% to 20% of capacity. What a
wasteofcomputingpower.
Virtualization allows the consolidation of multiple physical servers onto one physical server - the
host - as virtual machines (VMs). Each virtual machine appears to the outside world as if it were
an independent physical server. Each is independent of the others – a fault in one will not affect
theothers (thoughthetotal of theloads imposedbythesetof VMsmustbewithinthecapacityof
the host). Each VM provides its own operating environment, running its own copy of a guest
operating system. Typical virtualization products support Windows, Linux, and UNIX operating
systems.

A hypervisor adjudicates requests from the various VMs for host services, such as input/output
devices.
Leading virtualization products include ESX from VMware, Xen from Citrix, and Hyper-V from
Microsoft.
The Virtual Availability Problem
A major problem with virtualization is availability. Before virtualization, if a server failed, one
application was lost. In a virtual environment, if a physical host fails, it takes down multiple
applications with it. There are some strategies that can be used to mitigate the impact of a host
failure.
One strategy is to allocate critical applications to different hosts so that if a host fails, only one
critical application is affected. However, if load balancing is used, this strategy becomes
ineffective.Withloadbalancing,shouldonehostbecomeheavilyloaded,oneormoreofitsvirtual
machines are moved to other hosts to rebalance the load. Therefore, over a period of time, the
allocation of applications to hosts will become indeterminate. There is nothing to prevent two or
more critical applications from being hosted on one physical host. Should that host fail, multiple
criticalapplicationsmightfailaswell.
Another strategy is to use fault-tolerant servers as hosts. This will typicallyreduce the failure rate

three 9s, which translates into one or two failures per year. Stratus’ Avance1 and Marathon’s
everRun both support the Xen hypervisor and have availabilities of four 9s, which translates into
failure intervals of five to ten years. Stratus’ ftServer2 has a field experience of more than five 9s
(afailureintervalintheorderofdecades).ftServersupportsVMware.
Virtual Availability Solutions
Beyond these strategies, the virtualization products themselves provide several features for
improvingavailabilityinthefaceofseveralfailuremodes.
The first requirement for improving availability is to know when a VM has failed (of course, if a
host fails, all of its VMs will fail). To accomplish this, each VM generates a heartbeat. A

HostFailure–HighAvailability
In order to recover from a host failure, there must be two or more hosts that are clustered
together. Clustering in this case simply means that all hosts share the same storage device –
typicallya SAN (storage areanetwork) or aNAS(network-attachedstorage). Keep inmind that a
VM is simplyafile onthe SAN or NASstorage.Furthermore,thehosts mustbeconnected with a
redundanthigh-speeddatalink.

Managers on each host. Should a host fail, the failed VMs are restarted on a surviving host. The
only criterion is that the host to which the failed VMs are moved has to have enough capacity to

Most virtual environments provide a load balancer that monitors the loads on the hosts in the
cluster. It makes the load-rebalancing decisions. An example of a load balancer is VMware’s
DistributedResourceScheduler.
HostFailure–FaultTolerance
The problem with the availabilityapproaches discussed so far is that failover can takeminutes or
more, and all work in progress is lost. This can be mitigated with a fault-tolerant approach to VM
recoveryavailableinsomevirtualizationproducts.
The strategy is to provide a hot backup of a VM on another host. Should a VM fail, its backup
automaticallyandseamlesslytakesover.Failoverismeasuredinseconds,andnoworkislost.
VMware Fault Tolerance is one example of such a product. It creates a backup copy of a VM to
be protected on another host. During operation, the stack of the active VM is replicated over a
high-speed local channel to the backup VM. Therefore, the backup VM is always in the same
state as the active VM. If a host fails, the backup VM immediately takes over processing,
transparentlytoitsusers.
HostFaultTolerance
Note that this facilitydoes not protect against a VM failure on an otherwise operable host. This is
because the VM has somehow become corrupted, and the stack of its backup will be similarly
corrupted.Inthiscase,theVMmuststillberebooted.
DisasterRecovery
None of the above architectures provides disaster recovery. The clustered hosts and common
storage subsystem must all be collocated in the same data center. To provide recovery from a

The physical servers in both data centers can be active hosting their own sets of virtual
machines. Each replicates its database to a copy at the other data center (SAN or NAS
replication is typically unidirectional). Should a data center be taken out of service, the cluster in
the surviving data center brings the replicated database into a consistent state; and the physical
servers then mount it. At this point, the downed VMs can be restarted on hosts in the surviving
cluster.
As with typical disaster-recovery sites, recovery can take hours; and all work in progress at the
failed data center is lost. An example of a disaster-recovery facility is VMware’s Site Recovery
Manager.
ContinuousAvailability
Continuous availabilityhas not yet made it into the virtualized world in terms of existing products.
Recoveryfromfailurestakesmanyminutestohours.
However, conceptually, there is no technical reason why continuous availability could not be
achieved in a virtual environment. What is needed is bidirectional replication between the data
stores at the various sites. In this way, all hosts can be actively processing transactions for the
same application. If a VM, a physical host, or an entire data center should become disabled, all
that needs to be done is to resubmit failed transactions to surviving VMs. Recovery can be in
seconds.
Summary
Intheearlydays of virtualization,availabilitywas aserious concern because of the“all your eggs
in one basket” syndrome. However, as the technology has matured, several facilities have been
developedbythevirtualizationvendorstoprovideawiderangeofhigh-availabilityoptions.
Though we have used the VMware options3 as examples, most of the major virtualization
products provide equivalent functionality. Citrix’s Xen 4.0 now includes fault tolerance along with
the standard high availability options.4 Microsoft’s Hyper-V provides Quick Migration and Live
Migration for recovering or moving VMs and Stretch Clustering for disaster tolerance.5 Microsoft
and Citrix also play together via Citrix’s Essentials for Microsoft Hyper-V, which adds significant
managementfunctionalitytoHyper-V.6
