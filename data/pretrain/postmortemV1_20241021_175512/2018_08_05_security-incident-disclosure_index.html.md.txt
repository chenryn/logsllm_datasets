On 31st July 2018 [a security researcher
identified](https://medium.com/@vesirin/how-i-gained-commit-access-to-homebrew-in-30-minutes-2ae314df03ab)
a GitHub personal access token with recently elevated scopes was leaked
from Homebrew's Jenkins that gave them access to
`git push`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} on Homebrew/brew and
Homebrew/homebrew-core. They reported this to our Hacker One. Within a
few hours the credentials had been revoked, replaced and sanitised
within Jenkins so they would not be revealed in future. Homebrew/brew
and Homebrew/homebrew-core were updated so non-administrators on those
repositories cannot push directly to `master`{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge}. Most repositories in the Homebrew organisation
(notably not Homebrew/homebrew-core due to their current workflow and
maintainer requests) were also updated to require CI checks from a pull
request to pass before changes can be pushed to
`master`{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}.

### What was impacted

GitHub Support was contacted and they verified the relevant token had
not been used to perform any pushes to Homebrew/brew or
Homebrew/homebrew-core during the period of elevated scopes. **To be
explicit: no packages were compromised and no action is required by
users due to this incident.**

### What we're doing about it

-   We have for several years enabled 2FA and third party application
    restrictions for the entire Homebrew GitHub organisation. This was
    also recommended by the security researcher.
-   We enabled branch protection and required reviews on additional
    repositories as mentioned above.
-   We requested all Homebrew maintainers review and prune their
    personal access tokens and disable SMS fallback for 2FA.
-   The security researcher also recommended we consider using GPG
    signing for Homebrew/homebrew-core. The Homebrew project leadership
    committee took a vote on this and it was rejected non-unanimously
    due to workflow concerns.

We did, do and will continue to take the security of the project and our
users very seriously. We try our best to behave as a for-profit company
would do in terms of timely response to security issues but this is
heavily limited by our lack of resources. For example, in this the
Homebrew maintainer who resolved the above issues was on paternity leave
from work and the primary carer for their child and had to reach a quick
resolution while their child had a nap.

We need more help to improve Homebrew's security. Please consider
contributing your code and code reviews to our GitHub projects, get in
touch to volunteer to be on-call for security and/or system
administration emergencies or [donate through

Thanks for using Homebrew!
