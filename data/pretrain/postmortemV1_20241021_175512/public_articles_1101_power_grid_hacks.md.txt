Increasing Incidents of Hacker Intrusions
A recent investigation by the U.S. Congressional Research Service has determined that sensitive
computer systems maintaining the U.S. power grid increasingly are being attacked. It has distributed its

Furthermore, the report points out that the incidence of reported cyber intrusions aimed at undermining
the U.S. grid is increasing. Even worse, independent researchers have found that hacking into grid-
computing networks to be startlingly easy. In October, 2014, the Cyber Emergency Response Team
(CERT) revealed that several industrial control systems had been infected with a virus capable of
gatheringinformationabouthowtheU.S.powergridfunctions.
The report made several recommendations to the U.S. Congress to strengthen the U.S. cybersecurity
posture. The recommendations revolved around establishing a broader sharing of cyber threat indicators
and incidents between federal and private-sector entities. The goal is to enable integrated actions to

BlackEnergy
The primary attack vector used by hackers has been identified as the BlackEnergy Trojan horse.
BlackEnergy has been found in control systems the world over. Though it is capable of doing damage to
thecomputersitinfects,ithasprimarilybeenusedfordatagathering.
However, in the last two years or so, it has been upgraded to include a facility called “KillDisk.” Among
other malicious actions, KillDisk is designedtoterminateasoftwarefacilitycalled “ASEMUbiquity,” which
is a platform used by industrial control systems to manage their devices. KillDisk then overwrites the
executable with random data so that it cannot be restarted. At this point, the control system is disabled,
unabletocarryoutthefunctionsrequiredtokeeptheinfrastructurethatitwasmanagingoperational.
Investigators determined that, in many cases, the initial points of infection were Microsoft Office
documents that had been embedded with malicious macros. When an unsuspecting employee opened
the document, a backdoor was enabled on his system that allowed the injection of BlackEnergy into the
computer. It is distressing that such a simple social-engineering ploy can create power failures that can

The group behind BlackEnergyhas been dubbed “The Sandworm Gang.” It is believed that the gang has

Dragonfly
Another sophisticated malware facility is also emerging to attack the power grid – Dragonfly. Dragonfly
has managed to compromise a number of strategically important organizations for spying purposes and

Dragonfly’s initial targets were defense and aviation companies in US and Canada. However, it has now

According to security firm Symantec, Dragonfly bears the hallmarks of a state-sponsored operation,
displaying a high degree of technical capability. Based on the analysis of when they attack, Symantec
believesthattheattackersarelikelybasedinEasternEurope.
Dragonfly started with planting malware in phishing emails and in compromised web sites. It has now
moved on to Trojanizing legitimate software bundles belonging to different Industrial Control System
equipmentmanufacturers.
The Hacker’s Entry Point – the SCADA System
Let us turn now to one of the primary entry points for malicious code – the SCADA systems that control
thepowergrid.ASCADA(SupervisoryControlandDataAcquisition) system providescontrollers withthe
facilities required to monitor and control the field devices upon which utilities such as the power grid
depend. It automatically generates alarms should conditions in the field demand immediate controller
attention and provides a raft of historical data for trend analysis, root cause analysis, and many other
functionsimportanttotheutilities.
The household and building electrical power upon which we all depend comes to us through three major
infrastructures–generation,transmission,anddistribution:
 Electricity is generated by large electrical generators which are themselves powered by coal, oil,
gas,water,orothersources.
 This electricityis carriedover longdistance transmissionlines tolocalpoints of distribution.Since
power loss over the transmission network is a function of the current flowing through the lines,

transmission networks distribute electricity at very high voltages and low currents (power is
voltage times current). Typical transmission voltages are 230 to 500 kilovolts. Transmission
networks terminate in transmission substations, which reduce the voltage for distribution to
homesandbusinesses.
 From the transmission substations, the lower voltage electricity is distributed to other distribution
substations for routing to homes and offices. These substations feed the power lines so
ubiquitous on the telephone poles outside of our homes. The fact that these lines carryelectricity
at a “lower voltage” is a bit misleading. The voltage on the power lines outside of your home is
13,000 volts. Don’t touch a downed line! This voltage is reduced by transformers on the poles

SCADA systems are used to control the generator plants, the transmission lines, and the distribution
substations. ASCADAsystem comprises aMaster Station andasetof RemoteTerminalUnits,or RTUs.
AnRTU monitorsmultiple digitalandanalogfield devices inafacilityandcan acceptcommandsfrom the
Master Station to control these devices. A typical field device might be designed to measure the

The Master Station monitors the RTUs for status changes and maintains displays of the current field
status for the controllers. If a fault condition or an alarm condition should occur, the Master Station may
have the intelligence to issue commands to the RTUs to correct the situation automatically via its
monitoring applications. Otherwise, the Master Station accepts commands from the controllers to send to
thefielddevices.
etats
When SCADA systems were originally deployed decades ago, communication between the Master
Station and its RTUs was over polled telephone lines, LANs, WANs, fiber, microwave, or radio. These
were all point-to-point communication channels and posed no security issues. Therefore, early SCADA
systemswerenotdesignedwithsecurityinmind.
However, with the advent of the Internet, communication between the Master Station and the RTUs
moved to the Internet. The SCADA systems were somewhat modified to try to detect or deflect malware
intrusions,butthesefacilitieswerenotverysophisticated.
Therefore,theSCADAsystemshavebecomeaprimarytargetforhackerswhowanttocontrolthevarious
facilities of a power grid. As we said earlier, there has not been a hack on the U.S. power grid that has
causedanydamage.However,thatmaybeabouttochange,asUkrainefoundout.
Ukraine Loses Power Due to a Hacked Electric Grid
The complacency about power grid hacks came to a sudden end on December 23, 2015, when hackers
managed to cut off power for several days to 80,000 Ukrainian customers. This was the first known
instance of malware being used to generate a power outage. Fortunately for the affected Ukrainians,
Christmas cold had not yet advanced into Ukraine. Daytime temperatures hovered around 60°
Fahrenheit.
ResearchersdeterminedthattheBlackEnergymalwarewastoblame.BlackEnergyinfectedatleastthree
regional Ukrainian power authorities, disconnecting the electrical substations from the Ukrainian power
grid. Investigators determined that this appeared to be a coordinated effort bya malicious hacker. Russia
was immediately suspected, as it had just annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. However, Russia

This is a wakeup call for the energy sector. Yes, its power grids are susceptible to malicious hacking to
