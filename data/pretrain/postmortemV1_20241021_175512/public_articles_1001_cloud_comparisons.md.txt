Comparing Clouds with CloudHarmony
January2015
We have written frequently about whether public clouds are suitable for corporate critical
applications. We have published many Never Again stories about massive failures in
popular clouds such as Amazon, Google, Azure, and Rackspace. However, these are
really vignettes – snapshots in time. What are the real availability statistics for these and other clouds
overalongperiodoftime?1
The web-monitoring site CloudHarmony gives us an insight into this data as well as much more
information about cloud performance, cloud pricing, and cloud capabilities for dozens of public clouds.
CloudHarmony obtains its data from its own applications that are running in the clouds that it is
monitoring.
Furthermore, there are several web services that monitor clouds in real time and provide information on
thecurrentstatusoftheseclouds.Wereviewtheseservicesinthisarticle.

CloudSquareStatus
It is CloudSquare Status that gives us direct insight into the availabilities of the different cloud services.
The availability of almost 50 public clouds and their 500 regions are shown for a selected period of time,
from the previous week to the previous year. The availability for compute services, storage, database,
content delivery networks (CDN), Domain Name Services (DNS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS)
offeringscanbeselected.
For instance, the CloudSquare statistics show that Amazon’s nine EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) regions

CloudSquareDirectory
The CloudSquare Directory provides side-by-side comparisons of cloud providers that can be selected
from a list of almost 100 such providers. The comparisons include features, configurations, SLAs,
availability,pricing,andmore.
The comparison information includes compute services, storage, database, content delivery networks
(CDN), Domain Name Services (DNS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings. The description for
each service, where applicable, includes the number of service locations, the service availability, the
servicemarketshare,pricing,servicefeatures,computeinstancetypes,andstoragefeatures.

Other Web Analysis Services
There are several other facilities for testing connectivity and performance of web sites in real time. These
include:
CurrentlyDown
CurrentlyDown (www.currentlydown.com) can be used
to check whether a web site is down at the moment.
Just type in the URL of the web site, and its status is
immediately displayed., along with the response time
required to access the site. If the site is one which is
being monitored by CurrentlyDown, its availability
historywillalsobeshown.

CurrentlyDown gets a great deal of its
monitoring information from Twitter feeds. If it
shows that a web site specified by you is down,
it will alert you as to whether you are alone or
whether many have tweeted that the web site is
down. CurrentlyDown provides the means for
individualstoreportcurrentproblemswithaweb
site.
CurrentlyDown monitors hundreds of the most
popular websites and tracks website availability
over the long term. The outage history is stored for later reference. Outage data is displayed in easy-to-
understand charts so that a website’s availability on any particular date can be viewed. CurrentlyDown
also researches every issue and posts news about the outage cause and its status. The most notable
outagesarealsopostedtoitsTwitterandFacebookfeeds.

monitors thestatus of severalpopular websites,
combining user reports, tweets,informationfrom
other web sites that monitor service status, and
official announcements to indicate when there is
a service problem. The site provides a means
forindividualstoreportaproblem.
The status history for the past 24 hours is
displayed for any of the web sites that are
monitored. Web-site status is posted to
downrightnow’s Facebook page and is reported
viaTwitter.

Pingdom
Pingdom (www.pingdom.com) is a for-fee service that a company can engage to monitor its web sites.
Monitoring can be as frequent as once per minute from 50 locations over the world. Thus, problems not
onlywithawebsitebutwithnetworksconnectingthewebsitecanbequicklydetermined.
Pingdom provides a smart-phone app so that the status of web sites can be viewed at anytime,
anywhere.
Pingdom claims over a half-million customers, including HP, Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Google, Twitter,
Instagram,Disney,GitHub,andPinterest.
Summary
Public clouds still have a ways to go to achieve carrier-grade availabilities of five 9s or better. Some are
nearlytherenow–Amazon’s EC2computeservicehas achievedanaverageavailabilityof almostfive9s

(five minutes of downtime per year), which is probably better than the availability achieved by most data
centers. Amazon’s S3 storage service had an availability exceeding five 9s. However, public clouds like
Microsoft’s Azure with an average availability of a little over three 9s have a lot of maturing to do before

A capabilitythat all companies should consider for critical applications running in public clouds is the use
of multiple fault-isolated regions such as Amazon’s Availability Zones to run backup copies of the
applications inmultipleregions sothatanapplicationfailurecanbequicklyrecovered.Of course,justlike
any failover mechanism, failover to a backup region should be periodically tested to ensure that it will
work.Thisis whatsavedNetFlix2whenAmazonhadtorebootmanyofits virtual machines inSeptember,
