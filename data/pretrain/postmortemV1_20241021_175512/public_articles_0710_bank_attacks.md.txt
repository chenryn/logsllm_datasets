Islamic Hacktivists Attack U.S. Banks
October2012
The posting of the fourteen-minute anti-Islamic trailer, “Innocence of Muslims,” on YouTube in early
September, 2012, did more than spark outrage and massive anti-American demonstrations against U.S.
embassies throughout the Arab world. It launched cyberattacks against the largest of American banks in
retaliation for the film. Massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks took down the web sites of
Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and PNC for a day each over a two-week
period.

Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Warriors
Thegroupthatclaimsresponsibilityfor theattackscalls itself theIzzad-Dinal-Qassam CyberWarriors.It
isbelievedtobeanarmofHamas,thepoliticalpartythatgovernstheGazaStripinPalestine.
The group takes its namefrom the Muslim preacher Izz ad-Din Abd al-Qadar ibn Mustapha ibn Yusuf ibn
Muhammadal-Qassam,whowas aleader inthefight againstBritish,French,andZionistorganizations in
the Levant (an area encompassing roughly the western regions of the Muslim world) in the 1920s and
1930s.
The group makes its plans well known in advance via posting on certain web sites – notably
www.pastebin.com.OnSeptember18,2012,itposteditsinitialwarning:
“DearMuslim youths,MuslimsNationsandarenoblemen
“When Arab nations rose against their corrupt regimes (those who support Zionist regime) at the
other hand when, Crucify infidels are terrified and they are no more supporting human rights. United

The Banking Victims
Sure enough,onTuesday, September 18th, the Bank of Americawas attacked,followed, as promised,by
an attack the next day on JPMorgan Chase. The attacks were massive DDoS attacks that prevented
customersfromaccessingthebanks’websitesandonlinebankingservicesformostoftheday.
Following the BofA attack, the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC),
which is owned by dozens of large financial firms, including BofA and JPMorgan Chase, raised its cyber
threatlevelfrom“elevated”to“high.”

Sure enough, Wells Fargo was attacked on Tuesday, September 25th. U.S. Bank was attacked on
September 26th, and PNC on September 27th. In each case,the attack lastedmostof the day. (Weatthe

These attacks were followed the next week by preannounced attacks on Capital One, SunTrust Banks,
andRegionsFinancial.
Interestingly, the New York Stock Exchange did not seem to be attacked as threatened. Perhaps it was
sparedsinceitdoesnotdependuponapublicportalsuchastheonlinebankingservicewebsites.
A Volunteer DDoS Attack
The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Warriors evidently used a different and very effective strategy for their
DDoS attacks.The standard DDoS attack uses a botnet set up bythe hacker. After infecting hundreds or
thousands of computers around the world, the hacker sends a command to the computers to start
generatingrequests tothetargetsitetooverwhelm thesiteandmakeitvirtuallyinaccessibletolegitimate
users.
This group used a volunteer-powered DDoS strategy. It enlisted the cooperation of perhaps hundreds of
thousands of volunteers around the world who downloaded a program from a file-sharing site that would
send continuous request messages on command to a target. At the assigned time, the volunteers
launched their programs, and the target was overwhelmed with request messages. The attacks were
launchedunderthename“OperationAbabil,”meaning“swarm.”
This strategy had two consequences. One is that the typical DDoS mitigation strategy of filtering out
attack messages based on IP addresses was made very difficult because of the number of attack
sources. The other is that the targets were bombarded by an estimated 100 gigabits/second of traffic

DDoS Defense
Little can be done by law enforcement to curtail DDoS attacks. They are typically carried out in countries
wheretherearenolawsgoverningsuchattacksorwherelawenforcementislax.
Firmsneedtoimplementmitigatingcontrolsandaformalincidentresponseplanbeforeanattackoccurs.
Somemitigatingstrategiesinclude:
 purchasingmorebandwidthforcriticalwebsitesandthenetworksthatfeedthem.
 redirectingtraffictoacloud-basedalternativetoobtainadditionalbandwidthondemand.
 usingalternateroutingtoolstoredirecttraffictootherlocationstobalancetheload.
 using appliances that do packet analysis to separate good traffic from bad traffic, sending the
latertoanunusedIPaddress.
A useful discussion of these and other techniques can be found on the DDoS Defense web site
(http://www.ddosdefense.net/). See especially the article entitled, “How To Select A Distributed Denial of
Service‘DDoS’MitigationService.
Still, the best defenses may not protect even the best-prepared firms from a concerted attack such as
those described above. All firms should have a formal incident response plan that specifies how the firm
will continue to provide services and products during such a successful attack. This plan should be
includedinthefirm’sBusinessContinuityPlan.
Summary
The demand of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Warriors to “erase the nasty movie” has not been met.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has made the disgust of the U.S. government with the movie patently
clear. However, Google, the owner of YouTube, has removed the movie only in countries that have laws
against such blasphemy. Where freedom of speech is guaranteed, such as in the U.S., the movie is still
availableonline.However,othercountrieshaveblockedYouTubeuntilthevideoisremoved.
On September 27, 2012, U.S. federal authorities arrested Nakoula Basseley Nakouia, who created the
movie under the alias “Sam Bacile.” He was charged with the violations of his parole including his role in
the film making and his use of the alias. He is being held without bail. A Pakistani minister has offered a
bountyforthedeathofNakoula.
The video has sparked debates about the freedom of speech and Internet censorship. The First
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects freedom of speech in the United States. The U.S. Supreme
Court has interpreted this amendment in 1952 as invalidating government restrictions on blasphemyand,
in the mid-1970s, on hate speech. In March, 2011, the Court reiterated its position by an 8:1 majority.
