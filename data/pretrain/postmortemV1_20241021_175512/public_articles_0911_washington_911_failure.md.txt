911 Service Down for Six Hours Due to Software Bug
November2014
On Thursday, April 10, 2014, the entire state of Washington lost 911 service for all of its
residentsforsixhours.Someresidentsinsixotherstatesalsosuffered911outages.The
problem was caused byasoftware bug in acentralizedsite that handles over half of 911
callsfortheUnitedStates.
Centralization of 911 services is made possible by the move to Next Generation 911 (NG911), which will
be IP-based rather than based on land-line direct trunks. Consolidation of services may portend further

The Outage
At about 1 AM PDT on April 10th, call dispatchers in 911 call centers around the state of Washington
began to notice that no 911 calls were coming through. 911 call centers are called Public Safety Access
Points (PSAPs). Call dispatchers attempted to reroute incoming 911 calls to neighboring PSAPs but
foundthatthesejurisdictionshadnoserviceeither.
FranticcallstoCenturyLink,the911serviceprovider
for the state of Washington, provided no relief. It
took six hours to restore service. During that time,
4,500 911 calls in Washington state went
unanswered.Only770werecompleted.
Washington was not the only state affected, but it
was the only state to lose 911 calls to all of its
PSAPs. In total, 11 million people in seven states
were affected. Other states that lost partial service
included North Carolina, South Carolina, California,
Florida, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. In total, 6,600

Next Generation 911 (NG911)
A little background will set the stage for the description of the problem. In the early days of 911 service,
before the Internet became pervasive, 911 calls were made by land-line telephones. A 911 call was
received by the local central office that served the telephone. The central office knew the location of the
telephoneandroutedthe911calltothePSAPthatservedthatlocation.
Then came the Next Generation 911 service – NG911. The intent of NG911 is to take advantage of the
Internet to make 911 call servicing more efficient and flexible. Rather than the local central office directly
routing 911 calls to the local PSAP, it now routed the calls to a central site for rerouting to the PSAPs.
Communication links between the central offices and the central sites were initially land-line trunks,
specificallytime-divisionmultiplexing(TDM)trunksthatcanhandlemultiplecallsoverasinglelandline.
These lines are slowly being replaced with IP (Internet Protocol) communication links. One of the
advantages of NG911 is that voice is no longer the only means of communication. 911 messages can
now be sent over IP links by text, and even video can be relayed to a PSAP. NG911 implementation is
currentlyinprogressnationwideandwillnotbecompleteforseveralyears.
ApotentialAchilles’s healinNG911 is theconcentrationof services incentralcomputers.Afailureof one
of these central sites can have a major impact on 911 services. This is what happened on April 10th. The
problem was caused by a simple, easily correctable software bug. Even worse, there was redundancy in
thesystem;andiftheproblemhadbeencorrectlyidentified,servicecouldhavebeenrestoredinminutes.
The Software Bug
A major 911-services provider is a company by the name of Intrado Inc. Intrado provides some level of
911 function for over 3,000 of the nation’s 6,000 PSAPs. 260 million 911 calls per year, over half of all
nationwide911calls,arehandledinsomewayoranotherbyIntrado.
One of the services that Intrado provides is 911 call routing to the appropriate PSAPs. It maintains two
majordatacenterstodothis,oneinEnglewood,Colorado,andoneinMiami,Florida.Massivedatabases
relate the location of land-linetelephones and cell-phone locations to the nearest PSAP.Whena911call
comes in to one of Intrado’s routing systems, it reroutes the call to the nearest PSAP according to its
database.ThesetwocallcentersarecalledEmergencyCallManagementCenters(ECMCs).
Washington state had turned to CenturyLink to manage its 911 service. By agreement, CenturyLink
routedWashington’s911callstoIntrado’sColoradoECMC.
For incoming calls over TDM trunks, an Intrado ECMC assigns a unique identifying key to each call to
help it process the call. The system had a maximum capacityof fortymillion keys. Keys were periodically
purgedtoensurethattherewerealwaysasufficientnumberofkeystohandleincomingcalls.
However, the last key purge for the Colorado ECMC had occurred the previous year in September. At
11:54 PM PDT on April 9, 2014, the Colorado system ran out of keys. Incoming calls could no longer be
assignedkeysandcouldnotbehandled.Callstimedout,andcallersweregreetedwithabusysignal.
Whydid it take six hours to correct the problem? There were two factors that delayed the identification of
the outage. One was that there was a simultaneous outage in Oregon. The Intrado staff and CenturyLink
reasonably assumed that the problems in Washington and Oregon were caused by the same fault.
Eventually, the Oregon problem was solved, and it then became apparent thatWashington was suffering
adifferentproblem.

The other challenge was that a full-key condition was deemed to be not important, and this event was
assigned a low-priority alarm. All that happened was that thousands of alarms were logged, one for each
incompletedcall.Butnohumanbeingwasevernotified,andnoonenoticedthealarms.
Once the Intrado staff recognized the problem – six hours after it occurred – incoming 911 calls were
reroutedtotheMiamiECMCandservicewasrestored.
All in all, 81 PSAPs were affected in sixty counties located in seven states. The outage affected only
those PSAPs that communicated with the Colorado ECMC over TDM trunks. Those communicating over
IPlinksorcommunicatingtotheMiamisystemwereunaffected.

It is certain that future failures are bound to occur. Unlike previous outages that were often caused by
natural events such as weather, earthquakes, or fires, breakdowns in the future are more likely to be
hardertodetect.AsconsolidationofservicesincreasesduringthephaseovertoNG911,outagesbecome
more likely to be caused invisibly as computers fail or as software bugs arise. However, these are no
excuses.Callsforhelpmustgothrough.
Highlighting the problem of NG911 consolidation is that during the past three years there have been no
outages affecting an entire state or multiple states. Now that NG911 is being implemented, there have
beenfoursuchincidentsin2014,includingthoseinHawaiiandVermont.
This outage also provides a lesson for active/active systems. Intrado’s ECMC systems represent an
active/active architecture. 911 calls are being actively handled byboth nodes, and a call can be routed to
either node for processing. However, if one node fails and no one notices (or there is not an automatic
rerouting of traffic), all users on that node are down until the failure in recognized. It is imperative that
effectivemonitoringbeemployedonallnodescomprisinganactive/activesystem toimmediatelydetecta
failure and to either automatically recover to surviving nodes or to alert IT staff so that a manual
switchovercanbemade.
