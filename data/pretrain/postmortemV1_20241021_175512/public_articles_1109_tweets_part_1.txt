– Our September Twitter Feed of Outages
September2016
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass.With our new Twitter presence, we don’t
have to feel guilty. This article highlights some of the tweets that made headlines in
recentdays.

A just-completed project, though relatively tiny, off the coast of the U.S. state of Rhode Island is
at the forefront of a sea-based transition to renewable energy.

Gain value from your move to the IoT with continuous availability. John Fryer explains how in this
blogpost
It’s often difficult to fully understand the impact of modernizing an automation system and how an
investment in fault-tolerant platforms from Stratus, along with updated Programmable Automation
Controllers (PACs), can deliver rapid results. For Columbia Pipeline Group, the answer is
approximately$2.3 million in 2014 alone, even with a partial pipeline upgrade. Using theStratus
ftServer platform, which delivers high availability in excess of five nines (99.999%), Columbia has
achievedanoverallsystem-wideavailabilitylevelofover99.5%.

From the AvailabilityDigest: Everseethe1964 thriller "Failsafe"? What onecharacter said then is
sotruenow
Itiscertainlytrue thatthemore complexasystemis,themorelikelyitisthatitwillprovideerroneous
outputs. Computers are a major class of this sort of system. Because their actions are governed by
the humans who program them, and because humans are not fail-safe, neither are computers.
Though the movie “Failsafe” was not about computers per se, it emphasized the frailty of humans in
complexsituations.

ForgetSoftware—NowHackersAreExploitingPhysics
Practically every word we use to describe a computer is a metaphor. “File,” “window,” even
“memory” all stand in for collections of ones and zeros that are themselves representations of an
impossibly complex maze of wires, transistors and the electrons moving through them. But when
hackers go beyond those abstractions of computer systems and attack their actual underlying
physics,themetaphorsbreak.

UnreliableWirelessNetworkLeftFirstRespondersHigh AndDryDuringLouisianaFloods
Having already endured Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the U.S. state of Louisiana has once again
suffered catastrophic floods. During the two hurricanes, all of the commercial wireless networks
went down amid the devastation and were no more available for first responders than they were for
citizens trying to make and receive calls to loved ones. During the current flood, while some
commercial wireless networks have fared better than others, the communications failures during this
month’s flooding are a reminder yet again of why our first responders need a resilient, reliable and
purpose-builtwirelessnetwork.

ToStorm-ProofHoboken,aMicrogrid
With 80 percent of her city underwater and the power out, Hoboken (New Jersey) Mayor Dawn
Zimmer climbed the stairs to a senior apartment facilityand found a woman, alone and in tears.
She’d been trapped in her home, unable to leave the building without elevator service, and she
needed her medication. “Theyleft us in the dark,” she said. Superstorm Sandyin October 2012
gave Zimmer a new priorityfor her administration—preparing this New Jerseycityof 50,000

PuttingthetestbackintoDevOps
The DevOps community is all about speed and high-quality releases; and since mobile applications
and websites drive traffic and revenue, companies can’t afford to have site crashes or send out
buggy releases. To emphasize the importance of testing, people are putting it back into DevOps,

DigestOldiebutGoodie:With100%Uptime,DoINeedaBusinessContinuityPlan?
In our article entitled “All About Continuous Processing Architectures,” we pointed out that
active/active application networks are capable of incredible availabilities – uptimes measured in
centuries. One might well question the need for a Business Continuity Plan if the system is never
going to go down. No assumption could be more fallacious. Extreme availability does not mean an
absolute100%uptime.

Transformingtelcosflyhighasprocrastinatingairlinesgetgrounded
If you everhad second thoughtswhysomuch fusshasbeenmade of transformationin the telecoms
world, you only have to look at the airline industry to understand. Biting the bullet early in updating,
streamlining and simplifying everything from the network to the back-office has gone a long way in
saving telcos by reducing costs and making them more efficient. But for airlines it could mean the
differencebetweenlifeanddeath.

TheTrueMeaningofAvailability
High availability is the ultimate goal of all cloud-service providers (CSPs). It’s a testament to their
reliability and standard of service, providing a measurement of their ability to remain continuously
operational. But in their quest to attain the highest number of “nines” in their service-level
agreements, players in the cloud industry may have been neglecting the true meaning of availability
allthistime.
