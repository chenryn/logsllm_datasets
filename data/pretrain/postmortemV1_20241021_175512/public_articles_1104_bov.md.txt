Introduction

ACI BASE24 Classic financial transaction switch to manage its network ATMs and POS
terminals.1 For business continuity, its BASE24 system was running in an active/passive
mode on a pair of HPE NonStop S-Series servers. Early in 2015, the bank found that it needed to
upgrade these servers, which along with the operating system and application software, were nearing
their end-of-support life. The bank made the decision to migrate its BASE24 system to a pair of NonStop
NS-Seriesservers,againrunningasanactive/passivepair.
The bank also decided to replace its current data replication product with HPE Shadowbase solutions,
due to cost issues and to optimize its business continuity failover time for system outages, whether
scheduled or unscheduled. Furthermore, this replacement positioned the bank to take advantage of the
Shadowbase sizzling-hot-takeover (SZT) facility, which can typically reduce failover time to a few
seconds.
The Bank’s Original BASE24 System
The original configuration employed by the bank running its BASE24 system is shown in Figure 1. It
compriseda productionsystem (\S78PRD) and abackupsystem (\S78BKP),eachrunning on aNonStop
S-Series server. The production system ran the BASE24 application, which managed the bank’s ATMs
and POS terminals, and it communicated with other hosts in the financial transaction network to forward
ATMandPOStransactionsforauthorization.
TheBASE24files were initiallyallunaudited Enscribefiles.Thesourcesystem could notrunaudited files

for application data volumes. (TMF auditing is not recommended/should not be used on these special
diskpacks.)
The source Enscribe files were replicated to the backup system by a replication product that intercepted
changes to the production databases via an intercept attached to the source application and created
extract files of the database changes. The extract files were then sent to the backup system via an

The latest BASE24 Classic application is installed on both systems. Since the backup system has the
BASE24 application already installed and tested, it serves as a hot backup and can take over processing
fromtheproductionsysteminjustafewminutesintheSZTconfiguration.
The Shadowbase replication engine is configured to be bi-directional, meaning it can simultaneously
replicate in either direction. This configuration supports failover to the backup system, which must then
act as the production system and replicate changes back to the old production system once that system
isrestoredtoservice,tobringthesystemsbackintosynchronization.
The Phased Migration
The bank faced several challenges as it planned its upgrade. The primary problem was the existing
BASE24 version possessedsomedata inconsistencies with thenew BASE24 versionrunning on theNS-
Series servers. Therefore, data transformation was required in migrating the production data to the new
BASE24 release. These transformations were handled by customized User Exits implemented in the
Shadowbasesoftware.
The bank also decided, in part, to move from the original product that replicated data between the
production and backup systems, to HPE Shadowbase software, which requires TMF audited files. All of
thefiles inthe BASE24system wereunaudited,sothe upgraded BASE24system was further modifiedto

This was accomplished by installing a replay facility on the old Backup server to convert the unaudited
database changes into audited database changes. These new audited database files were then used as

To address these issues and perform the migration, the bank enlisted the aid of a professional services
(PS)teamassembledbyHPE.Thisteamutilizedthefollowingresources:
 HPEforhardware,operatingsystemandsoftwareinstallationandsupport
 PayX,anindustryleadingproviderofconsultingservicesandsupportinthepaymentsindustryfor
BASE24ClassicandBASE24-eps,amongotherpaymentsproducts
 GravicShadowbasepersonnel,forthereplicationenginework
Since the bank felt it was imperative that switchover to the new system be seamless and with no impact
on its customers, the project was organized into steps. Each step accomplished only one task and
involved only the necessary project partners, with the results thoroughly tested before the next step
began. The multiple steps were carried out from June through October 2015, when the new system was
putintoproduction.Thebasicstepsoftheprojectconsistedofthefollowingtasks(seeFigure4):
 InstallnewNonStopNS-Seriessystems(productionandbackup)
 InstallcurrentBASE24Classiconnewsystems
 ImplementAutoTMFtoautomaticallycreateauditedBASE24files
 Install and configure HPE Shadowbase software to replicate BASE24 data from old systems to
new systems, without interrupting service and keeping all systems synchronized with current
productiondata
 Testnewsystemindependently(includingfailover/failbacktesting)
 Cut over from the old system to the new system with minimal service interruption using
ShadowbaseZeroDowntimeMigration(ZDM)
 Shutdownoldsystems

this entire migration process, the old production system remained in service to act as a fall back in case
anythingwent wrong.Asexpected,itwasn’tneeded. Thebank nowconductsregularfailovertesting, with
completeteststhatbringthebackupsystemintofullservice.
The bank is now positioned to move from its active/backup configuration to a Shadowbase SZT
architecture. With the BASE24 application up and running on both production and backup nodes, if an
outage of the production system occurs, all that is needed is to re-route users to the backup system
(which is known-working and ready to process transactions), resulting in failover times that can be
measuredinseconds.

Summary
Thebank took averystale,agedBASE24system andupgradedboththehardwareplatform andBASE24
software with no outages except for a brief time during the final cutover. At the same time, the bank
replaced a costly data replication product with HPE Shadowbase software. The cutover application
service outage could, in fact, have been completely avoided if the bank had elected to use the
Shadowbase ZDM features that were installed and tested (an abundance of caution). Choosing a team
whose members had specific expertise to support the project was another major factor in the success of
the upgrade. This team included HPE for the NS-Series system upgrade, PayX for its BASE24 expertise,
andGravicfortheconfigurationofHPE Shadowbasesoftware.Inaddition,thebank implementedreliable
failover procedures that reduced its downtime due to a production failure from two hours to under four
