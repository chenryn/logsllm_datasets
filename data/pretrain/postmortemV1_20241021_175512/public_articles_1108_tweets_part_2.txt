Google,Amazonand AppleAreForgingtheFutureofCorporateEnergyManagement
Apple recently made headlines when it established a subsidiary called Apple Energy and filed
for authorization to sell capacity, energy and ancillary services in wholesale energy markets
nationwide. It will be some time before we see Apple participate in many of these markets,
since Apple’s application currently covers only its renewable energy projects in California and
Nevada as well as one under construction in Arizona. But the fact that a consumer technology
company has formed an energy subsidiary reflects the extent to which large corporations are
taking an active approach to energy management.

HowThisMassiveStructureintheOregonDesertKeepsFacebookRunning
There are a lot of ways to make sure you have fast Internet. You could move to a Google Fiber
city. You could select one of our Fastest ISPs. Or, you could build your house next to a
Facebook data center. Take the first Facebook data center, for instance. Opened in Prineville,
Ore., in 2011, it has served as the model for every data center the social media giant has built
since then, from Sweden to Iowa. It consumes so much bandwidth that it requires multiple ISPs
serving the area to fortify their networks, bringing local residents along for the ride.

WhydoesTexashaveitsownpowergrid?
Texas’ secessionist inclinations do have one modern outlet: the electric grid. There are three grids in the
Lower 48 states: the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection — and Texas. The
separation of the Texas grid from the rest of the country has its origins in the evolution of electric
utilitiesearlylastcentury.

Wanttoknowwhatthesquirrelsareupto?
"I don't think paralysis [of the electrical grid] is more likely by cyberattack than by natural disaster.
And frankly the number-one threat experienced to date by the US electrical grid is squirrels." - John
C.Inglis,FormerDeputyDirector,NationalSecurityAgency2015.07.09.

Aresquirrelsabiggerthreattothepowergridthanhackers?
After countless warnings from cybersecurity specialists about the digital security of the power grid, it
appears that a furry adversary with a proven track record of taking out the lights is still the biggest
threat to the grid. That adversary? – squirrels. The critters are such a large problem that the
AmericanPublic Power Association tracks the blackouts caused by squirrels with its own "Squirrel
Index."
