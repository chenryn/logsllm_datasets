Over the 2013 Christmas holidays, Target1 was hit with a massive theft of credit-card
information.Morerecently,itappearsthatHomeDepothassufferedasimilarfate.
But what use is this stolen information? Do the hackers use forged credit cards to make a lot of
purchases?No,theyselltheinformationontheDarknet,oftenformillionsofdollars.
Recent Hacks
TheTargethack occurredover athree-week period prior to the 2013 holidayseason.POS(point-of-sale)
terminals in its U.S. stores were infected with malicious software that captured the magnetic-stripe data
from cards that were being swiped in its terminals. The data was then sent to the attacker. Personal
informationfrom110millioncardswasstolen.
The recent suspected Home Depot hack may even surpass the Target hack. As with the Target hack, it
alsoappearsthatmagnetic-stripedata wascompromisedinthePOSterminalsbymalicioussoftwareand
senttotheattacker.InthecaseofHomeDepot,theattackmayhavebeengoingonforuptofourmonths
beforeitwasdetected.
How Were the Breaches Detected?
In neither case was the breach discovered by the victim company. In the case of Target, credit-card
companies were faced with a suddenly large number of fraudulent purchases. Upon investigation, they
found that batches of stolen cards had shown up on an underground web site that deals in stolen
personal information. The card companies purchased some batches and analyzed recent activity of the
cards. In all cases, the common denominator was Target Stores. From the card samples, it was
determinedthattheTargetbreachoccurredoverathree-weekperiodpriortoChristmas,2013.

In the case of Home Depot, the scenario was somewhat different. On Tuesday, September 2nd, it was
notedthatnewbatchesofstolencardinformationhadsuddenlyappearedonthe samewebsite.Analysis
of these cards led to Home Depot as being the common source. Evidently, the Home Depot hack had
been going on since April or May, perhaps for four months or so. By delaying the sale of the stolen data,

Interestingly, in the Home Depot case, batches of cards from U.S. banks were labeled “American
Sanctions.” Card batches issued by European banks were labeled “European Sanctions.” Was the Home

Infecting POS Terminals
The U.S. Secret Service has been investigating a POS terminal malware infection called “Backoff” since
October, 2013. It is not known if this is the malware that infected the Target and Home Depot terminals,
butthatisapossibility.
Unfortunately, this malware was not recognized by antivirus software until August, 2014. Seven POS
system vendors have confirmed that multiple of their clients have been affected by Backoff. The Secret
Serviceestimatesthatperhaps1,000U.S.businesseshavebeeninfected.
The Darknet

The Darknet actually originated quite legally under the auspices of ARPANET, the
predecessor to the Internet. Launched in 2002, a project called Tor was set up by the U.S.
Naval Research Laboratory with the purpose of protecting U.S. intelligence communications.
ItallowedgroupsofpeopleusingtheInternettomaintaincompleteanonymity.
Tor is an acronym for The Onion Ring project because of its many layers of protection. Tor directs
Internet traffic through a worldwide, volunteer network of more than 5,000 relays to conceal a user’s
location and usage from anyone conducting network surveillance. Tor is currently supported by the non-
profit Tor Project (www.torproject.com) and is heavily used legitimately by groups of people who need to
keeptheircommunicationsabsolutelyprivate.2
Unfortunately, this is also what purveyors of illegal products such as stolen information need to advertise
their wares. Any illegal use of the Tor network is now known as the Darknet. Most of the use of the
DarknetcanbetracedtosourcesinRussiaandEasternEurope(seehttp://carder.su/).
HackersdealinginstolenpaymentcardinformationontheDarknetareknownas “carders.”Carderseven
have their own blogging web site that can be found at www.cardersforum.se. Included on this web site is
a Bitcoin exchange. Bitcoins are typically used for transactions in the Darknet because, like the Darknet,
theyarecompletelyanonymous.3
Typical offers on the Darknet include U.S. stolen identities for $25 each, European stolen identities for

How Carders Make Money?
How do carders make money from stolen credit cards? The process takes many steps. The first step is
that the attackers sell their stolen information to brokers who buy in bulk. The brokers then break the
stolen informationintosmaller batches andsellthebatches tocarders.Thecarders haveseveral ways to
makemoneyoffofthestolenpaymentcardinformation.
One technique is to use a credit card to purchase pre-paid cards. These cards are then used to buy gift
cards issued by stores such as Amazon. The gift cards are used to purchase high value items such as
computers,smartphones,andgameconsoles.
Thecarderhasthepurchaseditemssenttoa“mule.”Amuleisininnocentandunsuspectingpersonwho
has been recruited through legitimate channels such as Angie’s list with the promise of “easy work-at-
home jobs.” The mule reships the items for a fee to a location specified by the carder, who then
assembles them into packages for resale overseas or on auction sites at significant discounts. By
frequently changing shipping addresses used by the mules (often to unoccupied houses or offices), the
cardercanescapediscovery.
The carders have discovered another way to make money. They scam spammers. A carder will sign up
as an affiliate of a spam campaign – for instance, an online pharmacy. However, instead of sending out
junk email, it uses the stolen credit cards to purchase items being promoted bythe spammer.The carder
earns a cut of 40% to 50% for everything it “sells.” It is not until a card company detects that a sale is
fraudulent that the spammer gets a chargeback and often higher merchant fees because of the large
number of fraudulent sales. The spammer loses the money on its sale but has already paid the carder,
whoisnolongeranywheretobefound.
What to Do?
Law enforcement agencies around the world are attempting to track criminal rings who deal in stolen
information. Fifty-six members of a card fraud ring centered in Russia and who stole information from
Visa,MasterCard,Discover,andAmericanExpresshavebeensentenced.
Of course,law enforcementis after thefact.Thekeysolutionto fraudulent cardtransactions is toprevent
card-information theftinthe firstplace. This canbestbeaccomplished byencrypting informationfrom the
payment card as it is being read by the POS terminal and then using only the encrypted information to
authorize the payment. Smart cards, prevalent in Europe, do just this. Using a computer chip embedded
into the card, a smart card sends its card number to the issuing bank in encrypted form. The POS
terminalneverseesthecardnumberinplaintext,sonomalwarecaninterceptit.
Summary
TheUnitedStates is ameccaforcarders becauseitis oneof thelastcountries (andthelargestsourceof
paymentcardtransactions)toadoptsmart-cardtechnology.
However, this is about to change. The U.S. payment-card industry has mandated that all merchants be
smart-card compatible by October, 2015, (except for gas stations, which have until 2017) or face a
“liability shift.” If a merchant does not process at least 75% of its transactions through an smart-card-
enabled terminal (whether via chip-cards or magnetic-stripe cards) and accepts a disputed or fraudulent
cardpayment,themerchantwillbeliableforthetransactionratherthantheissuer.
Similar attacks to those launched against Target and Home Depot are likely to continue until magnetic
stripes have been completely phased out. For the time being, smart cards continue to be adorned with
magnetic stripes so that they can be used in magnetic-stripe POS terminals. However, once all payment
cards have been converted to smart cards and all POS terminals have been replaced with those that will
readsmartcards,magneticstripeswilldisappear.Thismaytakeawhile,butitstimeiscoming.
