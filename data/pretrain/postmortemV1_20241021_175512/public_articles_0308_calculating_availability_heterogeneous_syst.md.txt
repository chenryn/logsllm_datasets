Calculating Availability – Heterogeneous Systems Part 4
August2008
In the first three parts of this series,1 we showed how to calculate the availability of complex
systemscomprisingserialandparallelcombinations of subsystemswith varyingavailabilities.We
considered not only system downtime due to multiple system failures but also system downtime
duetofailovertimesandfailoverfaults.
In this final Part 4, we demonstrate the use of these results to calculate the availability of an
active/active system backed up by a standby system that takes over only in the event of the
failureoftheentireactive/activesystem.

A Review of Parts 1, 2, and 3
When considering system availability, it is convenient to think of asystem being in one of several
states.For instance,thesystem maybe up, it maybe down, or itmaybe failingover toa backup
system.
From an availability viewpoint, there are two basic
structures in a complex system – serial subsystems
and parallel subsystems. A parallel subsystem a3
contains two or more components arranged so that
the subsystem survives the failure of one or more of a1 a2
its components. If there are s spare components in
thesubsystem,ittakes the failure of s+1components a4
tobringthesubsystemdown.
Aserialsubsystemcontains twoor morecomponents
arranged so that all components must be operational AParallelSubsystem ASerialSubsystem
for the subsystem to be operational. Should any one
ofthecomponentsfail,thesubsystemfails.
ParallelSubsystems
Let us consider a singly-spared dual-node parallel subsystem in which the nodes are the
componentsofthesubsystem.Thesubsystemisdownunderthreeconditions:
a) Bothnodeshavefailed.
b) Onenodehasfailed,andtheusersarebeingfailedovertoabackupnode.

In these equations, the first term is the probability that the system will be unavailable due to a
dual-node failure. The second term is the probability that the system will be unavailable because
it is in the process of failing over. The third term is the probability that the system will be
unavailableduetoafailoverfault.
SerialSubsystems
A serial subsystem requires that all nodes (which are its components) in the subsystem are
operationalinorderforthesubsystem tobeoperational.Shouldanyonenodefail,thesubsystem

ComplexSystems
In general, systems are constructed from parallel and serial subsystems. We call these complex
systems. The availability of a complex system is determined first by reducing each parallel
subsystem to a single node with an equivalent availability. This may leave one or more serial
subsystems. Each serial subsystem is reduced to a single node with an equivalent availability.
This may result in more parallel subsystems. This process continues until the system has been
reducedtoasinglenodewithanavailabilitythatistheavailabilityofthesystem.

ResolvingaComplexSystem
An Example
To illustrate the application of these concepts, consider a configuration that is an active/active
system backed up by a hot standby system. The active/active system comprises two nodes that
are five miles apart. The active/active databases at the two sites are synchronized via
synchronousreplication.
Thehotstandbysystemislocated1,000milesfromtheactive/activesystem.Thestandbysystem
is idle so long as the active/active system is operational. However, should the active/active
systemfail,alluserswillbeswitchedtothestandbysystem;andoperationswillcontinue.3

The active/active system in this example is a two-node system split across two sites. Each
processor at each site has access to two identical databases connected via a dual fibre-channel
SAN. One database is resident on a RAID disk subsystem, and the other is resident on a
mirrored disk subsystem. The active/active system is up if at least one processor is up as well as
oneSAN andonedisk subsystem.Alternatively,theactive/activesystem is down if the processor
pair is down or if the dual SAN is down or if the disk subsystem pair is down. We assume that
failover time from one node to another is zero and that the probability of a failover fault is also
zero(reasonableapproximationsforanactive/activesystem).
Shouldthe active/activesystem fail,thestandbysystem willtakeover operations for alltheusers
within 15 minutes and with a 99% success rate. It will take an average of 24 hours to return the
active/activesystemtoservice.

Both processors connect to both SANs as do both disk subsystems. Therefore, either processor
canaccesseitherdisksubsystemovereitherSAN.
DatabaseAvailability
The two disk subsystems are kept in synchronism by dual writes. That is, each write is written
synchronously to both disk subsystems. Therefore, either processor may use either disk
subsystem over either SAN. We ignore here the problems of distributed lock management and
distributedcache(seeFootnote3above).

Active/ActiveSystemAvailability
The active/active system is up if the processor pair is up and if the SAN is up and if the disk
subsystem is up. These subsystems are in series. Therefore, the availability a of the

oroverfive9s.Thisrepresentsaprobabilityoffailureof5.27x10-6.
In this example, it is clearly the processors that govern availability of the active/active system.
Adding a third three-9s processor as an additional spare would decrease the failure probabilityof
the processor group to 5x10-9 (over eight 9s), substantially removing it from the availability
equation. The SAN network, providing almost seven 9s of availability, would now be the
predominantfactor.
SystemAvailability
Should the active/active system fail, the standby system will take over. The standby system is a
NonStopsystemwithanavailabilitya offour9s:

The standby system will be brought into operation; and all users will be switched over to it, a
processthatrequires15minutesonaverage.Thisisthemeantimetofailover,ormtfo:
mtfo=0.25hours
Since the standby system is a hot standby, all applications are running and have the local
database mounted, sharing it with the asynchronous data replication facility. During the failover
time, users are switched, incomplete transactions are rolled back, and test transactions are
executedto ensurethatthe standbyis correctlyfunctioning.Atthis point,thestandbysystem can
begintoprovideservicetotheusers.

Using Equation (2) as a guide, the failure modes for recovery to the backup system are as
follows:

Failover
The probability that there will be a failover is the probability that the active/active system will fail.
Users are then failed over to the backup system. We assume that it takes 24 hours on the
averagetoreturntheactive/activesystemtoservice.Thisisitsmtr:
mtr=24hours
FromEquation(1),theprobabilitythatthesystemwillbedownbecauseofafailoveris

Thus, this active/active system with a hot standby can achieve seven 9s of availability. Seven 9s
represents an average downtime of 3 seconds per year. Assuming that it will take 24 hours to

Summary
By breaking down a complex system into an iterative series of parallel subsystems, the
availability of the overall system can be determined. A parallel subsystem comprises a set of
nodes thatcan withstandthefailureof oneor morenodes.Aserialsubsystem willfailif anynode
inthesubsystemfails.
The first step in the calculation of the system’s availability is to resolve the availability of parallel
subsystemsinwhichoneormorenodesmayfailandthesystemremainsoperational.Ifthereisa
failover time required, the downtime during failover and the probability of a failover fault must be
considered.
