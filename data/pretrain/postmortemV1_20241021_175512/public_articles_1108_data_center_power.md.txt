Data Centers Consume Inordinate Amounts of Energy
August2016
The explosion of digital content, big data, e-commerce, and Internet traffic is
positioning data centers to be among the largest consumers of electricity. Data
centersareamongthefastest-growingusersofelectricityintheUnitedStates.
In 2013, data centers consumed an estimated 91 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, more than twice that
of all households in New York City. If worldwide data centers were a country, they would be the world’s
twelfth largest consumer of electricity, ranking somewhere between Spain and Italy. Data-center energy
consumptionisestimatedtoincreasebymorethan50%by2020.
The world’s aging power infrastructure is unable to keep up with the electricity demand in many
developedcountries.

According to EMC Corporation, about 100 megabytes of new information is created every minute for
everyhumanbeing on Earth.Theneed to analyze this datais followingsuit. Businesses arebeginningto
realize that the power required to support their High Performance Computing clouds, clusters, and
supercomputersisnotgrowingasfastastheirneeds.
The processing power required to service all of this activity plus that of corporations are provided by
twelve million servers housed in three million data centers (from closets to hyper-scale cloud computing
centers). Hyper-scale cloud computing data centers, such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and NetFlix,
represent only a small fraction of the power consumption of all data centers. As shown in Table 1, the
vastmajorityofdata-centerenergyisconsumedbysmall,medium,andlargecorporatedatacenters.
A growing segment in this collection of data centers is multi-tenant data centers. These data centers
provide the compute, storage, and networking facilities that companies can lease to provide their
processing needs. Multi-tenant data centers typically charge by the space (or by the rack). Associated
with each rack is a power allotment. The customer does not pay for power so long as the power
consumedbytherackislessthanthatallotted.

The information and technology ecosystem now represents about 10% of the world’s electricity
consumption. It takes 34 power plants, each generating 500 megawatts of electricity, to power all data

Causes of Data Center Power Inefficiencies
A primary cause of data-center power inefficiency is that in most organizations, the department
responsible for data-center management is separate from the one paying the electric bills. Only about
20%ofITdepartmentspaytheirelectricbills.
In multi-tenant data centers, the situation is even worse, as those that provision IT equipment and those
that are responsible for the payment of the electric bills are carried out by different companies. Thus,
thereislittleincentivetoworryaboutpowerefficiency.
A single refrigerator-size server rack in a data center consumes as much power as an average
household. Yet, the average server in such a rack operates at no more than 12% to 18% of its capacity
while it continues to draw 30% to 60% of its maximum power. This is because it is provisioned to handle
itspeakloads,whichmayonlyoccuroccasionally.
Even worse, about 30% of all servers are “comatose.” They are no longer used. Typically in the past,
when a department wanted to deploy a new application, it would acquire a server for that application.
When the application was no longer needed, the server would not be recycled. It simplyremained on the
data-centerfloordrawingpower.
Thus,much of the energy consumed by data centers is used to power twelve million servers that do little
ornoworkmostofthetime.
The situation is even more striking in multi-tenant data centers. The IT equipment and the power to drive
that equipment are paid not by separate departments, but by separate companies. Since each rack is
givenapower allotmentbythedatacenter,thecustomer does notpayfor power if his servers intherack
draw less power than that allotted. Of course, if the servers begin to draw more power, the customer is
motivated to attempt to control the power consumption of his servers. It is only then that the customer
maybemoremotivatedtoinvestinmoreefficientequipment.
IT managers are extremely cautious about implementing aggressive energy management programs
because they are concerned that such measures could threaten uptime. Uptime is one of the primary
metricsuponwhichtheirperformanceisjudged.

Steps to Take to Improve Data-Center Power Efficiency
Thereareseveralstepsthatcanbetakenbydata-centeradministratorstoimprovepowerefficiency:
 Shut down unused servers. However, data-center administrators cannot always tell whether a
server is trulycomatose. It mayappear that it is forever idle. However, it maybe used at the end
of each month to run a critical application. Data-center administrators are therefore unwilling to
shutdownserversthatappeartobecomatose.
 Extend the use of virtualization. Virtualization is used extensively in the hyper-scale cloud data
centers, achieving average server utilization of 50% to 60%. However, virtualization has yet to
make major inroads into smaller data centers. By using virtualization, smaller data centers could
significantlyincreasetheirserverutilizationsandstillprovidethecapacityforpeakworkloads.
 Focus on long-term total cost of ownership rather than the upfront procurement costs of servers.
Purchase Energy Star servers, which cost more to procure but are less expensive over the long
term when energy costs are considered. The use of such servers saves not only in the cost of
power to operatetheservers butalsointhecoolingcostsfor thedatacenter,sincetheseservers

 Usedatadeduplicationtoreducetheneedfordata-storagesystems.
 Use solid-state storage. SSDs generate much less heat than rotating hard disks and therefore
requirelesscooling.
 Raisetheoperatingtemperatureinthe data-center roomfrom thenorm of 64degrees Fahrenheit
to 75 degrees, a temperature that standard equipment today can tolerate. Some new equipment
nowavailablecanoperatesatisfactorilyintemperaturesashighas95or100degreesFahrenheit.
 Have multi-tenant data centers charge customers directly for the power they use rather than
simplygivingthemapowerallotment.
 Consider moving the data center to an area with abundant, clean, and affordable power such as
Iceland,Norway,Sweden,andtheCanadianprovinceofQuebec.Manyoftheseareasarerichin
hydroelectric and geothermal energy. Such northern areas can also provide cool outside air to
reducethepowerdemandofcooling.
Summary
If just half of the potential energy savings were realized by today’s data centers, they could slash their
electricity consumption by 40%. This is equivalent to the electricity consumption of all the households in
theU.S.stateofMichigan.
