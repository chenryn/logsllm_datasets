Bug at BT forwards every sent email to one man's email account
BT, the UK's largest broadband provider, admitted that a "testing" error resulted in every email sent
across its network being forwarded to a single account for three hours in April. A "Steve Webb"
received every email sent by BT users. Customers may have seen errors when sending mail
because the inbox on the receiving end grew full and began to bounce new mail back to the sender.

St.Thomas-St.JohnBlackoutCausedByHumanError,FaultonFeeder
A fault on a feeder along with human error was the cause of an eight-hour service interruption in St.
Thomas – St. John on a Sunday night in mid-April. When the feeder experienced a fault, its relay
allowed the fault to remain on the line for a longer period than required and resulted in the loss of
otherfeeders.The powersystem became unstable but would have metmostof the powerdemands.
However, a power plant control room operator attempted to close or re-energize the originally
impacted outage without first ensuring that the fault was cleared. This action resulted in a
reoccurrence, this time sidelining both remaining generating units, knocking out all remaining
feedersandleadingtothedistrict-wideelectricserviceinterruption.

Googletocloudcustomers:Sorry,buthere'showtwobugsknockedusoutworldwide
If you had trouble accessing certain apps on Monday, April 11th, there'sa chance it was caused by a
brief but widespread outage on Google's infrastructure-as-a-service offering, Google Compute
Engine (GCE). The outage only lasted 18 minutes, but it knocked out GCE instances in all regions.
That's not good news for customers who expect Google's multi-region datacenters to offer some
failovercapability.

TappingEarth’sAbundantGeothermalEnergy
Geothermal energy is generated by heatfrom Earth’s rocks, liquids and steam. It can come from
shallow ground, where the temperature is a steady 10 to 16 C, hot water and rocks deeper in the
ground, or possibly very hot molten rock (magma) deep below Earth’s surface. As with clean-
energysources like solar, geothermal energy systems vary, from those that use hot water from the
ground directly to heat buildings, greenhouses and water to those that pump underground hot water
or steam to drive turbines. Unlike wind and solar, geothermal provides steady energy and can serve
as amore cost-effective and less environmentallydamagingformofbaseloadpowerthanfossilfuels
or nuclear. It’s not entirely without environmental impacts, but most are minor and can be overcome
withgoodplanning.

Hownationalinfrastructurebecametopofthehackerhit-lists
The world of cybercrime expands incrementally each day, leading to the current state of affairs in
which even national infrastructure organisations are vulnerable to the growing sophistication of
hackers. To newsreaders around the world and especially the hundreds of thousands of victims in
Ukraine, the ability of hackers to worm their way into critical infrastructures and even cause mass
blackouts is understandably shocking. To those with a deep familiarity of the cybersecurity field, this
