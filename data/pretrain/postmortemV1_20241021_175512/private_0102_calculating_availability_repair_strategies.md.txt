parallel repair, via which service technicians are dispatched to all failed nodes and work
onthemsimultaneouslytoberepaired.
sequential repair, via which there is only one service technician who repairs the nodes

Clearly, we would expect that parallel repair would be advantageous over sequential repair since
we are applying more repair effort to the system, but to what extent is this an advantage? We

ParallelRepair
Let us take the simple case of a singly-spared system (that is, s = 1). In our previous article, we
notedthatthemaximumnumberoffailuremodesforthiscaseis
n(n1)
f 

wherenisthenumberofnodesinthesystem.
This is explainable as follows. The system will fail if two nodes fail simultaneously. There are n
ways that one node of the n operable nodes can fail. Given that one node has failed, leaving just
n-1 operable nodes in the system, there are n-1 ways that a second node can fail. Therefore,
there are n(n-1) ways that two nodes in the system can fail, thus taking it down. However, this
argument has counted each node pair twice. For instance, a node 4 failure followed by a node 3
failure has been counted as well as a node 3 failure followed by a node 4 failure. Therefore, the
countishighbyafactorof2,andwecorrectforthisbydividingtheresultby2.
As we consider this argument in the light of repair strategies, we realize that we have assumed
that the order of node failure is not important. No matter which node fails first, the node that is
repaired first is the one that returns the system to service. This implies that the nodes are being
repaired simultaneously, since either one could be repaired before the other. This is parallel
repair.
Thus,fortheparallelrepairstrategy:

SequentialRepair
If there is only one service technician, the order in which the nodes fail is important because the
first node that failed will be the first to be returned to service. Therefore, the maximum number of
failuremodeswhenasequentialrepairstrategyisusedis
f n(n1) forasingly-sparedsystemwithsequentialrepair (3)
There are twice as manyfailure modes when sequential repair is used in a singly-spared system
than when parallel repair is used. Therefore, the probability of a system failure, which is

TheImpactofRepairStrategyonSystemProbabilityofFailure
The above analysis has concentrated on singly-spared systems. But what if there is more than
onespare?
The difference between the number of failure modes for parallel or sequential repair is the
differenceinthenumberofwaysthatanygivensetof s+1nodescanbechosenforfailure.There
are s+1 ways that the first node to fail can be chosen, s ways for the second node, s-1 ways for
the third node, and so on until the last node, for which there is only one choice. Therefore, the
number of different ways that the same set of s+1 nodes can be chosen is (s+1)!. This is the
parallelrepairadvantageandleadstothefollowingrule:
Parallel Repair Failure Probability Advantage Rule: If there are s spares configured for
the system, parallel repair will reduce system failure probability by a factor of (s+1)! as
comparedtosequentialrepair.
For instance, if there is one spare node, parallel repair will have a 2:1 advantage over sequential
repair.Iftherearetwospares,parallelrepairwillhavea6:1advantage.
TheImpactofRepairStrategyonSystem MTR
Theamountoftimethatasystemisdown,itsmeantimetorepair,orMTR,isthetimethatit

For sequential repair, the mean time to repair the system, MTR, is, in fact, the nodal repair time
mtr (we will use lower case mtr and mtbf for a node and upper case MTR and MTBF for the
system).Thus,
MTRmtr forsequentialrepairofasingly-sparedsystem (4)
For parallel repair, we have to be a little more careful. On the average, a service technician will
makeone repair during each time interval of mtr, thenode’s mean time to repair. Remember that
this is an average time to repair – some repairs will take much longer, and some will be much
faster.
If there are two service technicians working independently on two failed nodes, in the time mtr
therewillbeontheaveragetworepairs.Thus,therewillbeanaverageofonerepairduringevery
mtr/2 time interval. For instance, if nodal mtr is four hours, and there are two downed nodes that

done in the four-hour period, or one repair on the average every two hours. Therefore, in this
case,itwilltakeontheaveragetwohourstorepairthefirstnodeandreturnthenodetoservice.
Thus, for parallel repairs, the average system MTR for a singly-spared system is one-half the
nodalmtr:

parallel repair will reduce system MTR by a factor of (s+1) as compared to sequential

parallel repair will increase system MTBF by a factor of s! as compared to sequential

The Importance of Nodal Repair Time
TheSingle-SparedNodalRepairTimeRule
Over and above the repair strategy that is used when a multiple node failure takes down a
system, as discussed above, there is significant leverage for reducing system failure probability
bysimplyreducingtherepairtimeofanode.
Let us return to the basic availability equation which states that the probability of failure of a
systemistheproportionofthetimethatitisdown:
MTR MTR
F1A   (8)
MTBFMTR MTBF
where
F istheprobabilityoffailureofthesystem.
A istheavailabilityofthesystem.
MTR is the average amount of time that the system is down following a
failure(themeantimetorepair).
MTBF is the average time that the system is up following a repair (the mean
timebeforefailure).
That is, the probability of failure of the system is the time that it is down (MTR) as compared to
the total time (MTBF+MTR, since the system is either down or up). The approximation is good if
MTR<<MTBF,whichiscertainlytrueinthecasesinwhichweareinterested.
Let us take one more step before continuing. Based on the basic availability equation, F = 1-A ≈
MTR/MTBF, we note that the failure probabilityof a node, (1-a), is approximatelymtr/mtbf, where
mtr is the average repair time for a node (its mean time to repair), and where mtbf is a node’s
averageuptime(itsmeantimebeforefailure).

The system failure probability is a function of (mtr)s+1. If we can reduce the nodal repair time bya
factor of k, the system probability of failure has been decreased by a factor of ks+1. For instance,
in a dually-spared system, if the nodal repair time can be reduced by 2, the system probability of
failureisreducedbyafactorofeight.Thisleadstothefollowingrule:

Note that for a single-spared system (s = 1), this reduces to our single-spared repair rule given
above.

We know the reduction in the system probability of failure due to reduced nodal repair time from
the above equations.We can determine the impact of reduced nodal repair time on system MTR
from Equations (6) and (7). Knowing these parameters, we can determine the increase in system

Summary
We have analyzed the difference between parallel repair and sequential repair and have seen
that parallel repair provides significantly improved availability as expressed by our Repair
StrategyRules:
Parallel Repair Failure Probability Advantage Rule: If there are s spares configured for
the system, parallel repair will reduce system failover probability by a factor of (s+1)! as
comparedtosequentialrepair.
Parallel Repair MTR Advantage Rule: If there are s spares configured for the system,
parallel repair will reduce system MTR by a factor of (s+1) as compared to sequential
repair.

Parallel Repair MTBF Advantage Rule: If there are s spares configured for the system,
parallel repair will increase system MTBF by a factor of s! as compared to sequential
repair.
If one spare node is provided, parallel repair reduces the probability of failure by a factor of two
and reduces system MTR by a factor of two. If two spares are provided, failure probability is
reduced by a factor of six, system MTR is reduced by a factor of three, and system MTBF is
increasedbyafactoroftwo.
Clearly, if one is going to go to the expense and effort of an active/active system, one must
ensure that the service team is large enough and distributed widely enough to effectively provide
parallelrepair.
