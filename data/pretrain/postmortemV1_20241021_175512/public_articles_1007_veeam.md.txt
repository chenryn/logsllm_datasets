A Look at Today’s Data Center Availability
July2015
Organizations face increasing demands for “always on” availability. How are they faring?
A 2014 survey1 by Veeam Software (http://www.veeam.com/), a provider of data center
availabilityproducts,exploresthistopic.
Thesurvey,performedinconjunctionwithVansonBourne,anindependentmarketresearchorganization,
is based on interviews with 760 senior IT decision makers in ten countries. The interviewees represent
companies in retail, distribution, transportation, manufacturing, financial services, and business and
professionalservices,amongothers.
Thesurveyconcludesthatthesystem anddata-availabilityrequirementsforcompaniesisever-tightening,
andthatcompaniesarestrugglingtokeepup.

The Availability Gap
Even with their extensive investments in data-center modernization, companies have been unable to
keep up with the increases in their SLA requirements for RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO
(RecoveryPointObjective). This is especiallytruefor mission-critical applications.Currently, abouthalf of
allapplicationsareconsideredmission-critical.
Withrespectto RTO,mission-criticalapplications currentlytakean average of 2.9hours torecover, while
non-mission-critical applications require an average recovery time of 8.5 hours. These recovery times
comparetoaverageSLAsof2.7hoursand10.0hours,respectively.
RPO is a function of how frequently backups are taken. Following a system failure, it is possible for all
data since the last backup to be lost. Backups for mission-critical systems are taken every 4.8 hours on
theaverage. Theaverage backuptimefor non-mission-critical applications is 14.5hours.Thesecompare
toaverageSLAsof3.5hoursand11.5hours,respectively.
Eventhoughcompliance withrespecttosomeSLAs is close, SLAs aregetting tighter;butthetechnology
is not changing. Some countries (Italy, Switzerland, the U.K.) are missing the RTO mark by more than a
factor of 2:1. Likewise, other countries (Germany, Switzerland, Singapore) are missing the RPO mark by
asimilarfactor.
The Financial Cost of Downtime
On the average, organizations encounter unplanned downtime in some application or another thirteen
timesper year.Theaveragecostofdowntimeformission-criticalapplicationsapproximatesUSD$83,000
perhourandfornon-mission-criticalapplicationsaboutUSD$44,000perhour.
In addition to the cost of downtime is the cost of lost data. The average cost for an hour of lost mission-
criticaldata is aboutUSD $71,000.For non-mission-critical data,thecost is comparabletoUSD $42,000.
Based on the average backup intervals, a single incident can cost an organization about USD $341,000
formission-criticaldataandUSD$608,000fornon-mission-criticaldata.
Adding the costs of downtime and lost data, a single incident can cost an organization about USD
$451,000 for a mission-critical system outage and close to USD $782,000 for non-mission-critical system
outage. At an average of 13 incidents per year, enterprises face an average annual cost in excess of
USD$10,000,000.

If RTO and RPO could be reduced to 15 minutes or less, total annual costs due to system outages could
be reduced to about USD $500,000. This demonstrates the advantage of active/active systems,2 which

It is interesting to note that the cost of system failures due to non-mission-critical systems may be more
thanthecostofsystemfailuresduetomission-criticalsystems.
Availability Solutions and Capabilities
The inability to achieve an organization’s availability goals comes down to the legacy backup solutions:
without sufficient capabilities, IT departments cannot achieve the RTO and RPO SLAs that the business
demands.Thesecapabilitiesinclude:
 High-speedrecovery(lessthan15minutes)
 Data-lossavoidance(lessthan15minutes)
 Verifiedprotection(guaranteedrecoveryofeveryfileandeveryapplicationeverytime)
The primary reason why organizations cannot implement these capabilities is the cost of the new
technology followed by a lack of expertise and the inability of their current products to provide these
functions.
Data Backup Failures
When a backup is made, there is always a chance that it is damaged and will not recover. Organizations
should therefore test their backups to ensure that they can be used effectively for data recovery.
However,thisisatime-consumingtask;andonlyafractionofbackupsaretested.
On average, organizations test only 5.3% of their backups every quarter. Thus, the majority of backups
are not tested and can fail. The result is that approximately 16.7% of backups fail. With an unplanned
downtimeoccurring13times per year,this means thattheretypicallywillbetwobackupfailures per year,
greatlyincreasingthecostofdowntime.
Patches and application upgrades should also be thoroughly tested before they are put into production.

Summary
IT departments need to be certain that recovery time is as short as possible, that data loss is minimized,
andthatbackupswillrecoverasexpected.
Some of the statistics determined from this studycan be very useful in determining where your company
