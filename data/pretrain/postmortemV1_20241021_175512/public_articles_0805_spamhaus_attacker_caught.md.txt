Spamhaus Attacker Caught
May2013
A massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) cyberattack was waged against the Dutch spam-filtering
company, Spamhaus, for ten days during March of this year.1 It is believed to be the largest DDoS attack
in the history of the Internet. The alleged mastermind of the attack, Sven Olaf Kamphuis, 35, has now
been arrested in Spain and has beenextraditedtoTheNetherlands.Therehe willstandtrial under Dutch

The Attack
TheVictim
Spamhaus is an anti-spam watchdog group that works alongside law enforcement agencies such as the
FBI(theU.S.FederalBureauofInvestigation),emailproviders,andnetworksaroundtheworld.
Spamhaus provides a blacklist of IP addresses for servers that are determined by Spamhaus to host
email spammers. The list is provided to ISPs, corporations, and spam-filtering vendors. The lists are
typicallyusedbytheseorganizationstorestrictincominginformationfromspammingsites.
Itis estimatedthat1.4billionInternetusers are protectedbytheSpamhaus blacklist.Thismeans that 1.4
billionuserscannotreceiveanythingfromalistedsite.
TheAttackers
CyberBunker, named for its headquarters in an old NATO five-story bunker, is a Dutch web site that
claims it will host anything but child pornography and terrorism-related content. The CyberBunker web
site was designated a spam site by Spamhaus and is on the Spamhaus blacklist. Understandably, the
management of CyberBunker, headed by one Sven Olaf Kamphuis, was very unhappy with Spamhaus
forblacklistingit.
In retaliation for this, a massive DDoS attack was launched against Spamhaus in an attempt to shut it
down. A group calling itself Stophaus has claimed responsibility for the attack, calling their activities
“Operation Stophaus.” CyberBunker and Kamphuis have denied responsibility for the attack, but Internet
forensicsclearlypointthefingeratthemboth.
TheAttack
The DDoS attack against Spamhaus lasted from March 18 to March 28, 2013. The attack started out
fairly small, driving about 10 gigabits per second (gbps) against the Spamhaus servers. Spamhaus

maintains a distributed architecture through data centers in The Netherlands and Great Britain and easily
weatheredthisstorm.
The attack then escalated to 75 gbps, which matched the largest known DDoS attacks to date.
Spamhaus enlisted the aid of CloudFare, a U.S.-based security firm to help it out. CloudFare spread the
attack across many of its 23 data centers to filter out malicious traffic and deliver just legitimate traffic to
Spamhaus.
Inretaliation,CloudFarebecameincludedintheattack,andthemalicious traffic increasedto300gbps,a
level never before seen in a DDoS attack. CloudFare was able to scrub even this level of traffic, and
Spamhauscontinuedinbusiness,albeitwithsomedifficulty.Finally,onMarch28th,theattacksstopped.
TheInternetVulnerabilitythatFueledtheAttack
Classically, DDoS attacks are launched by botnets. Botnets are thousands of infected PCs (or in some
cases, volunteered PCs) that will send traffic to a site upon command from a botnet control center. A
typicalPCbotnetmightbeabletogenerateseveralgbpsofmalicioustraffic.
To increase the scale of the attack, botnets are now emerging using infected servers. A large server can
generate hundreds of times the traffic that a PC can deliver. With server botnets, malicious traffic
measuredinthetens of gbps canbegenerated.Itis this sortof botnetthat was usedtoattack onseveral
occasions major U.S. banks by Islamist hactivists demanding that the offensive video, “Innocence of
Muslims,”bewithdrawnfromtheInternet.2Theseattacksinvolvedattackratesof50to75gbps.
How did the Spamhaus attackers achieve hundreds of gbps of attack data? They used a vulnerability in
the Internet that has been known for years and that experts have warned may one day be used as a
weapon. The method is called a reflected DNS attack. The internet is loaded with old DNS servers that
will respond to any request to convert a URL to an IP address, not just to requests from their domains.
TheseDNSserversareknownasopenresolvers.
AreflectedDNSattack isquitesimple.ADNSquerytoconvertaURLtoanIPaddressissenttoanopen
resolver with a spoofed sender IP address. The spoofed IP address is that of the site to be attacked. The
resultisthattheresponsetotherequestissenttothe attackedsite.Thekeytosuccessofthismethodof
attack is that a request message is about thirty bytes, but the response is more in the order of 3,000
bytes. Thus, there is about a hundred-to-one magnification factor. An attacker need only generate three

There has been an effort to get rid of open resolvers. Unfortunately, this is not high on the priority list of
busyIPnetwork administrators.Therearecurrently27 million openresolvers ontheInternet,andtheir IP

Sven Olaf Kamphuis
Dutch authorities were able to track the source of the Spamhaus attack to Spain and to Sven Olaf
Kamphuisdirectly. DutchjudicialauthoritiesissuedaEuropeanwarrantforthearrestofKamphuis.

Kamphuis is the self-proclaimed spokesperson for the Stophaus
attackers and describes himself on his Facebook page as the
“Minister of Telecommunications and Foreign Affairs for the
CyberbunkerRepublic.”Itisunlikelythatthiswillgainhimdiplomatic
immunity.
He considers himself a campaigner for Internet freedom, and likens
himself to Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who publishes
classifiedinformationandnewsleaksfromanonymoussources.
Kamphuis describes Spamhaus as a company that wants “to get
their wayandshut people down. Theydo it allthetime.If peopledo
notcomplywiththeir demands theyjustlisttheentireinternet provider.That's whathappened.It is notus
but Spamhaus who's censoring of peopletheydon't likeandmafiatactics that are threateningfreedom of
theinternetatthemoment.
"Spamhaus itself is a more urgent danger. Pointing at websites and saying they want it shut down
and then they get it shut down without any court order. That is a significantly larger threat to internet
andfreedomofspeechandnetneutralitythananythingelse."
The Prosecution
Kamphuis was extradited to The Netherlands on Monday, May 6th. He appeared before a court in
Rotterdam on May 8th.Upon recommendation by the Dutch Public Prosecution Service, the court ordered
Kamphuisheldforfourteendays astheinvestigationcontinues.Atthattime,thecourtwilldecidewhether
toholdhimindetentionforalongerperiodoftime.
The investigation is being led by the Dutch High Tech Crime Team. Kamphuis presumably will be
chargedwithlaunchingaDDoSattack,acriminaloffenseunderDutchlaw.
Kamphuis continues to deny his involvement in the attack. He maintains that the attack was launched by
StophausmembersinChinaandRussia.
The Attacks Continue
These guys don’t give up. After Kamphuis’ extradition to The Netherlands, Dutch government web sites
were hit with DDoS attacks, From May 7th to May 8th, its Rijksoverheld.nl and Government.nl web sites

Via a posting on Pastebin on Tuesday, May 7th, a group who said that they were supporters of Kamphuis
claimedresponsibility.
Summary
DDoS attacks are on the rise.3 They are easy to accomplish, and can do significant damage to a
company’s public-facing web sites. Companies must be prepared to undertake emergencyprocedures to
mitigatesuchattacks.Thisisbecomingamust-haveinBusinessContinuityPlans.
One possible approach is to have contractual relations with a DDoS mitigation company. These
companies monitor a site’s traffic and can detect a DDoS attack shortly after it begins. They advise
companies what steps to take to thwart it. If these steps are inadequate, the mitigation company can
