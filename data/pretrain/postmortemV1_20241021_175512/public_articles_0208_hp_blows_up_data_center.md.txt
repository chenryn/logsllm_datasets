HP Blows Up Data Center
August2007
As a demonstration of the rapid failover capabilities of HP systems, HP set up a data center with
amix of its systemsandbackedupthedatacenter witharemotedatacenter.Itthenblewupthe
primary data center (yes, actually blew it up with explosives) to demonstrate fast recovery in a
simulatednaturalgaslineexplosion.
Thedemonstrationwas conductedattheNationalTechnical Support(NTS) BallisticsTestCenter
in Camden, Arkansas. The data centers consisted of a NonStop system, an HP-UX system, an
OpenVMSsystem,aLinux system,andaWindowssystem,allconsolidatedwithaStorageWorks
XP storage array. The primary data center was set up in an open field. The backup data center

Monitoring equipment measured the time from the blast to the time that each system came up.
Theirmeasuredrecoverytimeswere:
OpenVMS 14seconds
NonStop 34seconds
HP-UX 73seconds
Windows 105seconds
Linux 113seconds

This reminds me of a true story that occurred during one of the San Francisco earthquakes.
Following the earthquake, a Tandem customer phoned the Tandem Support Center and asked
directions on how to get its Tandem back up. As the service technician began to go over the
reboot procedure, the customer explained that rebooting wasn’t necessary. The system was
runningfine.It’s justthat it gotknockedover onto its side,andtheyneededhelpingetting itback
up.
