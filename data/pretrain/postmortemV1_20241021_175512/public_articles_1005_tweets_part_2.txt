There are many arguments that the mainframe is on its way out, and they all have one thing in
common: they are all wrong. And nowhere is this truer than in the financial services industry, which
isdominatedbymainframes.

Starbucksbreakdownshowshowregistershaveevolved
The register malfunction that forced Starbucks to close stores on 24 April was surprisingly large.
It affected all company-owned stores, or more than 60 percent of roughly 13,500 locations in the
U.S. and Canada. That’s enormous because registers that once merely rang up tabs and stored
cash have evolved into hubs that collect enormous volumes of data and carry out many tasks.

Spark's mobile network is gradually returning to full operations after it suffered an outage on
Friday 24 April. It had initially attributed problems to congestion on its network after Friday's 6.2

outage began, some customers were still having problems texting, calling and using mobile data.

Join the conversation. “I am sure that many of you work for banks and other financial institutions. In
my recent Availability Digest article entitled “Bank of England Suffers Significant Outage”
(http://bit.ly/1CSyB2w), I point out the challenges that such enterprises face in replacing their
decades-old legacy core systems. As an alternative to replacement, they are adding front-ends via
middleware to provide new functionality such as online banking and mobile banking. What is your
