CheckpointedProcessPairs
Criticalsystem processes areimplementedas checkpointed process pairs.Withthis technique, a
failedprocesscanberecoveredinmilliseconds.
Two copies of the process are spawned, each in a
differentprocessor blade.Oneprocess is designated the
primary process, and the other process is its backup.
The primary process keeps its backup process
synchronized via checkpointing. Whenever the state of
the primary process changes, that state change is sent
to the backup process via a checkpoint message. The
backup process uses the checkpoint information to
update its state. In this way, the backup process can
immediatelytakeover processingfrom theexactpoint at
whichtheprimaryprocessfailed.
If theprocessor in whichtheprimaryprocess is runningfails,or if theprimaryprocess aborts,the
NonStop operating system will immediately activate the primary process’ backup. Processing
continuesuninterrupted.Themechanismexistsforabackupprocessthathasjustbeenpromoted
to primary to start its own backup process in a surviving processor, though this is usually not
done.
Critical operating system processes such as disk processes, communication processes, and
processmonitors(usedforprocesspersistence,asdescribednext)aregenerallyimplementedas
checkpointed process pairs. Many third-party products use process pairs for their critical
processes.

NSMA Software
NonStop blades run substantially the same NonStop operating system as do all other
contemporary NonStop systems. However, some modifications were necessary to create what is
nowtheJ-Seriesofbladeoperatingsystems:
MemoryAllocation
Both IPUs share the same memory as well as the operating system image, locks, and other
shared resources. However, a small amount of main memory is allocated to each IPU. This
private memory of 64 kilobytes holds such structures as the IPU’s live register set, its ready list,
anditsdatacacheandinstructioncache.
ProcessScheduler
A new process scheduler was implemented for NSMA to take advantage of the multicore
architecture.TheroleoftheprocessscheduleristoassignprocessestospecificIPUs.
Rather than running the IPUs off a common task queue as is often done in SMP (symmetric
multiprocessing) systems, the NSMA process scheduler assigns processes to a particular IPU.
This is because moving processes between IPUs is very expensive. For user processes, this
assignmentisdoneatprocess-creationtimeandgenerallyisfixedforthelifeoftheprocess.
However, the process scheduler has several options, called affinities, built in for later expansion,
someofwhichareusedintheinitialimplementation.Theseschedulingaffinitiesinclude:
 Dynamic – The IPU is picked when the process is ready to run (used for interrupt
processes).
 Hard – The process is locked to the IPU (used for Measure performance-measuring
processes).
 Group – All of the processes in a group always run on a single IPU and are moved as a
group.DP2processesarecurrentlytheonlyprocessgroup.
 Soft – The IPU is selected by the scheduler. In the initial release, a process is assigned
to an IPU at process-creation time. In later versions, processes may be moved between
IPUsfordynamicloadbalancing.
NSMA Management
The management of NonStop blades is integrated into the wider HP system-management
products, especially HP’s Systems Insight Manager (SIM), which provides management of
heterogeneoussystemsacrosstheentireenterpriseenvironment.AllNonStopmanagementtools
and third-party products continue to provide their existing functionalities. Full centralized

New to the NonStop world is the Onboard Administrator (OA). Implemented as a pair of
redundant modules within the blade enclosure, the OA manages enclosure power and cooling
and monitors the health of the processor blades and the ServerNet interconnects, generating
alerts whennecessary.Itis accessibleviaaWebinterfaceandinterfaceswithNonStopOSMand
HPSIM.
The major NonStop serviceability application for bladed systems remains the Open System
Management (OSM) facility. OSM is a browser-based system management tool for NonStop
systems.IthasbeenupgradedtosupporttheOAandtomonitorCLIMsandSASdiskarrays.
HP Systems Insight Manager is HP’s management facility for managing heterogeneous systems
across the enterprise. Several plug-ins called NonStop Essentials have been developed for it to
manageNonStopsystems.Theyinclude:
 ClusterEssentialsformanagingclustersofNonStopsystems.
 I/OEssentialsformanagingCLIMsandSASarrays.
 Performance Essentials for monitoring the performance of heterogeneous clusters of
LinuxandNonStopservers.
SIM runs on a Linux system. However, the interface provided by the NonStop Essential plug-ins
require no knowledge of the syntax of NonStop or Linux commands. The interface is an intuitive
GUI.
NSMA Performance
Performance tests of NonStop BladeSystems using HP’s Order Entry benchmark (which is TPC-
C compliant) show that the processing power of an IPU is substantially that of an NS16000
processor. Therefore, since there are two IPUs, the throughput of a NonStop blade is roughly
twice that of an NS16000 processor. Order-Entry benchmark tests show the following per-logical
processorcapacities:
NS16000 165tps
NonStopBlade 349tps
Since an IPU is equivalent to an NS16000 processor, the response times are roughlyequivalent.
However, it should be noted that because a blade has twice the processing capacity, it may
requiretwicethememory.
An interesting observation is that a blade processor is slowed down somewhat due to the
multicore scheduling overhead and memory contention. However, this is offset by the overhead
caused by the LSU (logical synchronization unit), which is the voting mechanism for the multiple
physicalprocessorsthatcomprisealogicalNS16000processor.
The Fault-Tolerant Circle
NSMA has gone full circle to return to the original Tandem architecture. The architecture of
Tandem’s first product, the TNS1,4 carries through to the HP NonStop systems today. Each
system can have up to sixteen logical processors. Should a processor fail, the processes it had
been running will instantly fail over to surviving processors (though process failover in the early
dayswasallthroughcheckpointingsincepersistentprocesseshadnotyetarrivedonthescene).

The early systems (TNS1, TNS2, TXP, VLX, CLX, Cyclone), were each powered by custom-
designed logical processors. In the early
NSVA NSMA
1990s, the logical processors were
redesigned with commodity RISC

microprocessors. These logical
TNS1,TNS2,
processors wereusedintheK-series and TXP,VLX,CLX

S-series systems. Since the RISC
processors did not have much in the way
of internal error checking, each logical 1980s
processor used two RISC chips running
NSAATMR K-series
in lockstep at the memory-access level.
The S-series
The logical processor would fail if there Fault-Tolerant
were a mismatch, thus providing fast-fail Circle
topreventdatacorruption. 2004 1990s
Under HP, the NonStop logical
processors evolved to use dual lock-
stepped Itanium microprocessors.5 NSAADMR
Because these microprocessors were not
deterministic, memory lockstepping could
no longer be used. Therefore, the 2003
microprocessorswerelock-steppedatthe
I/O level (any packet delivered to the interconnecting ServerNet fabric). Since each
microprocessor was now anindependentprocessor,the logical processor survivedeven if one of
its microprocessors failed. This dual modular redundancy (DMR) architecture was named NSAA
(NonStop Advanced Architecture). Subsequently, a TMR (triple modular redundancy) option for a
thirdmicroprocessorwasofferedtoprovideextremereliabilities.
However, the Integrity microprocessors were so reliable in terms of their internal error checking
that fast-fail became not so important for manyapplications. In recognition of this, HP introduced
a simplex version of its Integrity series that it called the NonStop Value Architecture. NSVA
completedafullcirclebacktotheearlydays ofTandemsystems,inwhicheachlogicalprocessor
was a single processor with no lockstepped, fast-fail protection. After all, if this architecture was
good enough in the ‘70s to give Tandem the niche edge in fault-tolerant computing, it is good
enoughnowformanyapplications.
The NSMA architecture follows in the footsteps of NSVA, offering a single microprocessor-based
logical processor in a fault-tolerant configuration and utilizing software failover to recover from
processorfailures.
