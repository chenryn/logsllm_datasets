Skype Holiday Present – Down for a Day
January2011
Just as businesses were winding down for the holidays and families were busy making plans to
get together, the popular Skype Voice over IP (VoIP) telephone service went quiet. From the
morningofWednesday,December22nd,customerswereunabletoplacecallsforoveraday.
We expect absolute reliability from our telephone services. To understand how an outage of this
magnitude could have happened, we must first understand the architecture of Skype’s peer-to-
peernetwork.

Skype’sVoIPServices
Headquartered in the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg and partially
owned by eBay, Skype (originally Sky Peer-to-Peer) offers a full
range of communication services using the capabilities of the
Internet.CommunicationbetweenSkypeusersanywhereintheworld
is free. Communication between a Skype user and landline phones
ormobiledevicesisavailableatverylowcosts.
Starting with telephone service using VoIP in 2003, Skype has expanded its offerings to include
texting,instantmessaging,video,conferencing,filetransfer,andscreensharing.
Skype provides businesses with additional services. They include Skype Connect, which extends
Skypeto SIP1-enabled PBXs,and SkypeManager, whichallows abusiness tomanage its Skype
users.
Skypeconnects25millionusersworldwideatanygivenpointintime.
Skype has become the largest international voice carrier, carrying 13% of all international traffic.

Skype’sPeer-to-PeerNetwork
Unliketraditionaltelephonesystemsthatdependuponmassiveinvestmentsincentralofficesand
landline networks, Skype uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The backbone of its network is the
Internet. Routing of calls is done by supernodes, which are customer computers on which Skype
has installed its own server software. Except for authentication and certain added-feature

services, Skype has no other servers to which customers connect in order to communicate with
eachother.Therefore,Skypehasverylittleinfrastructuretofinanceandmaintain.
Though the Skype protocol is proprietary and unpublished, the general conjecture in the
literature2 is that on every customer’s computer is a Skype client. Certain of these computers
have been commandeered by Skype to act as supernodes. Supernodes must be computers that
arenotbehindafirewallandthathavesufficientbandwidthtocarryoutthesupernodeduties.Itis
estimated that the number of supernodes in the Skype network numbers in the hundreds of
thousands.
Supernodes
Thesupernodes provideseveralfunctions necessarytotheP2Pnetwork.Firstofall,theyresolve
addresses. Each customer has a user name that uniquely identifies him. When a customer logs
in, his user name is authenticated by the authentication server; and he is assigned to a
supernode. The supernode network discovers his presence and provides a translation service
similar to that provided by a DNS (domain name service) network. Instead of converting URLs to
IP addresses as is done by a DNS server, the supernode network converts user names to
supernode locations. Therefore, when a customer indicates a desire to connect to another
customer,thedistributeddirectoryservicesofthesupernodenetwork determinehowtoroutethat
call;andthetwocustomersaredirectlyconnected.
The other function provided by the supernodes is connection of clients behind firewalls. If both
clients involved in a connection are behind different firewalls, they cannot communicate directly
witheachother.Rather,asupernodeisassignedtoactasarelaynodefortheconnection.
Distributed directory services use distributed hash tables to find clients and their associated
supernodes.3 When a supernode enters or leaves the network, the network automatically

The Outage
TheSkypeCrash
On Wednesday morning, December 22, 2010, Skype began to act erratically. Calls took longer
and longer to set up. Finally, all communication stopped. It was not until the following day that
servicebegantoberestored.
Aweek later,theSkypeCIOpublishedablogdetailingwhathadhappened.4Theproblem started
when a number of support servers that handle instant messaging and texting became
overloaded. This significantly slowed down responses to the Skype clients active in those
servicesatthattime.
The slow down, unfortunately, ran into a bug in certain Windows clients (Version 5.0.0.152) that
prevented the client from processing those responses (Version 5 of the client had just been
releasedthepreviousMay).Consequently,theclientscrashed.
The big problem was that many of the clients were supernodes, so supernodes started
disappearingfrom thenetwork.ItwasestimatedthathalfofallSkypecustomerswererunningthe
faultyclient,andthistriggeredcrashesin25%to30%ofSkype’ssupernodes.
The sudden reduction in supernode count caused the remaining supernodes to become
overloaded, and they started to crash. The failures cascaded rapidly through the network, and
Skypecamecrashingdown.
TheRecovery
Reintroducing supernodes into the network takes a lotof discoverytime, especially if the network
is unstable and if supernode PCs are being turned on and off. To aid in this recovery, Skype
commandeered servers normally used for video teleconferencing to introduce hundreds of
“mega-supernodes” into the network. As the network was recovering, theydistributed a corrected
version of the client (Version 5.0.0.156) to all customers. The network gradually recovered, and
themajorityofSkypecustomerswerebackonlinethenextday,Thursday.

Do You Want to be a Supernode?
If you are a Skype customer and if your PC is not behind a firewall, you run the risk of being
surreptitiouslyelevatedtoasupernode(somewouldsayinfected).
Skype claims that the CPU and bandwidth load imposed by supernode processing is negligible.
They will not elevate a PC to supernode status if it does not have the capabilityto easilyperform
supernodefunctions.
However, what if you don’t want to be asupernode? In Version 3.0, Skype introducedaswitch to

Lessons Learned
This was notthefirstmajor outagesufferedbySkype. InAugust, 2007, Skype wentdownfor two
days when a new client version was released. The resulting rash of download activity
overwhelmeditsnetwork.
In the current outage, Skype had released a corrected version of the client before the crash
occurred;butmostcustomershadnotyetdownloadedtheupdate.
In his blog posting referenced above, the Skype CIO suggested many lessons that Skype has
learnedfromthisoutage:
 Itisreviewingitsprocessforautomaticupdatestomakeitmoreefficientandcontrollable.
 Itislookingintowaysofdetectingandrecoveringfromsuchproblemsmuchfaster.
 It will evaluate its testing procedures to better find bugs that could take down the entire
system.
 It will keep under constant review the capacity of its core systems and will continue to
investinbothcapacityandresilienceofthesesystems.
As an apology, Skype is offering thirty minutes of free calling to its Pay As You go and Pre-Pay
usersandanadditionalweekofserviceforthoseonasubscriptionplan.
This outage shows once again the bottom line of disaster planning for businesses. If there is a
technology upon which you depend, you had better have a plan as to how you will continue in
businesswhenthattechnologyfails.
