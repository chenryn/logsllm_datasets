OpenVMS Emulation on PCs
September2013
According to HP’s latest roadmap for OpenVMS,1 OpenVMS on Integrity will be supported for several
years. However, support for OpenVMS on VAX and Alpha machines may potentially end in the next two
to three years. Many OpenVMS systems have been running critical applications for decades.
Reprogramming these applications to run on different machines is an expensive, time-consuming, and
riskyproposition.
One alternative is to not touch the applications, but to run them under emulation on modern-day
commodity x.86 PC servers. In this article, we review vtAlpha and vtVAX, a pair of emulators that allow
OpenVMS and Tru64 applications to run unchanged on bare-metal or virtualized Intel or AMD x86
servers. vtAlpha is a product of AVTware (http://www.avtware.com/) and vtVAX is a product of Vere
(rhymes with fair) Technologies (http://www.vax-alpha-emulation.com/). Both companies sell both
products,andbothproductsaremutuallysupportedbythecompanies’respectiveresellers.

At this point, the operating system, all HP utilities, all third-partyproducts, and all custom applications will
run in the same way that they did on their original physical system. No changes to applications are
required. There is no user retraining nor are there system administration changes. Even program
development remains the same.The vtAlpha or vtVAX virtualization layer ensures that the new hardware
platform will behave exactly like the VAX or Alpha system that it replaced. Both the OpenVMS and Tru64

Common Characteristics of vtAlpha and vtVAX
vtAlphaandvtVAXhaveseveralfeaturesincommon.
They both run on multi-core 64-bit x86 processors. These include Intel’s Xeon and i7 processors and
AMD’sOpteronandPhenomprocessors.
BothvtAlphaandvtVAXcanrunonabare-metalserver(i.e.,onewithnootheroperatingsystem),orthey
can run in a virtualized environment such as VMware, Hyper-V, Xen, or KVM. When running bare-metal,
several instances of vtAlpha and vtVAX can run concurrently on the same host providing that there is
enoughprocessingpower,memory,andnetworkconnections.
When running as a virtualized machine (VM) under VMware, a vtAlpha or a vtVAX VM can be migrated
via vMotion from one physical host to another. This adds a degree of resiliency not found in the original
physicalsystems.

ortheycanbevirtualizedbythenewsystem’sdisks.Thisbringsseveraladvantages:
 Application backup data from the old physical system does not have to be migrated. Compatible
tape drives can be connected to the new PC host. The tapes can be read and written just like in
theoldsystem.
 Backups to virtual tape are disk-to-disk and consequently are much faster than backing up to
physicaltape.Backupscanbewrittenfromdisktophysicaltapeforarchivingatalatertime.

Both vtAlpha and vtVAX support OpenVMS clusters and Tru64 TruClusters. Thus, the exceptional

There are some differences between the two products. They are discussed briefly in the following
sections.

vtAlpha supports virtually all AlphaStations and AlphaServers. When building the emulated environment,
it is onlynecessaryto specifythe Alpha model being emulated and its configuration. vtAlpha will build an

HostSystemRequirements
Though any of the Intel or AMD multi-core 64-bit x86 processors can be used, the Intel Xeon and the
AMD Opteron processors are preferred because of their performance. One core is dedicated to each
emulatedAlphaCPU,andanothercoreisneededforeachtwoAlphaCPUsforI/Ouse.
The minimum amount of PC host memory required
for an Alpha server is the memory that was
configured for the physical server plus 25% plus one
GB.Morememorycanbeconfiguredforperformance
improvement. vtAlpha supports up to 32 GB of
memoryperAlphaserver.
Networking
The Alpha Ethernet Adapters are supported,
including DE435, DE450, and DE500. Though these
are 10-Mbps and 100-Mbps adapters, vtAlpha will
take advantage of full-duplex, one-Gbps Ethernet
adapters if they are configured on the PC host. Full
support is provided for COM ports and serial
communication adapters. Every virtualized Ethernet
adapter or communication adapter can be mapped
directly to its own physical adapter on the PC host.
Moreover, vtAlpha also includes Virtual Network
Switches that allow multiple virtual Ethernet adapters
tosharethesamehostlink.
Storage
vtAlpha supports storage devices attached via virtual
SCSI channels or FibreChannel adapters. Emulated
disks may be physical disks attached directly to the
PC host, or they may be virtualized. Virtualized disks are logical disks whose contents are contained in
containerfilesinthehost’sstoragesystems.
vtAlpha supports all Alpha legacy storage adapters, including MSCP, DSSI, IDE, and RAID. It also
supportsNFSfilesystems.
Likewise, tapes may be physically attached, or they may be virtualized on disk. Physical tapes are
requiredforarchivalbackup.

vtVAX

Like vtAlpha, vtVAX can run bare metal or as a host operating system in a virtualized environment using
VMware, Hyper-V, XEN, or KVM. However, it can also run as an application in a Windows environment.
Windows7,WindowsXP,WindowsServer2003,andWindowsServer2008aresupported.

vtVAX supports virtually all VAX, VAX
server, MicroVAX, and VAXstation
systems with up to 512 MB of memory.
vtVAX also supports the virtualization of
multi-CPU VAX systems such as the
VAX6000 and VAX7000. In these
systems, up to four CPUs and 3.5 GB of
memorycanbeemulated.
When building the emulated environment,
it is only necessary to specify the VAX
configuration being emulated using the
GUI-based Configuration Manager utility,
copy the VAX disks to the PC host disks,
start vtVAX, and boot the emulated VAX
system. vtVAX will build an exact image of
thehardwarethatthesoftwareexpects.As
an option, the vtVAX Instruction Caching
option is available to dramatically improve
the performance of CPU-intensive
applications such as statistical analysis
andbusinessanalytics

HostSystemRequirements
As with vtAlpha,anyof the Intelor AMD multi-core64-bitx86processors canbe used.However,theIntel
Xeon and the AMD Opteron processors are preferred because of their performance. Each instance of a
VAX system requires twocores.Theminimum supportedprocessor speed is 1.6 GHz,though2.4GHz is
preferred.
For each emulated VAX, the memory with which it was configured in its physical server is required plus
25%plus2GB.
Networking
vtVAX supports all VAX Ethernet adapters,including theDEQNA/DELQA(XQ), SGEC (EZ),and DEMNA
(EX) adapters. Each adapter must be mapped to a dedicated physical Ethernet adapter on the host
system.GigabitfullduplexEthernetissupported.
BothDECnetandTCP/IPprotocolsaresupported,andtheycanrunconcurrently.
Many VAX systems in control applications use custom-designed peripherals attached via Q-Bus
adapters. These devices are supported via the NuVAX product (from The Logical Company) under which
replacementQ-Busadaptersaredevelopedforspecialdevices.
Storage
AswithvtAlpha,disksandtapesmaybephysicalunits attachedtothePChost.Alternatively,theycanbe
virtualized. The contents of virtualized disks reside on storage devices that are part of the PC host
system.SeveralsmallerVAXdiskscanbeconsolidatedontooneorafewhostdisks.
Virtualized tape contents are stored on host disk. Logical devices can be backed up using the OpenVMS
BACKUP utility. Backups can be moved to physical tape if necessary for archiving purposes. Because

existing tapes can be read by attaching the appropriate tape drive to the PC host, there is no need to
migratearchivedtapesforthenewsystem.
UptofourMassStorageControlProtocol(MSCP)controllerscanbeconfigured,eachhandling32disk or
tape drives. Up to two SCSI bus systems with seven disk or tape units can be emulated. In addition, one
virtualtapecontrollercanhandleupto16tapedrives.
An emulated VAX system can integrate with modern data storage solutions, including RAID arrays, NAS,
SAN,FibreChannel,FC/IC,FCoE,andcloudstorage.
Licensing
The HP licenses that have been purchased for the original VAX or Alpha systems remain in effectfor the
emulatedsystems.However,HPrequiresthattransferlicensesbeobtained.
Licenses are stored on a low-profile USB dongle that plugs into the host PC. The USB license dongle is
network capable. It can be stored on any server in the network that the licensed emulated vtAlpha or
vtVAX can access.Disaster-recoverylicenses support failover of afailed hostto another hostmachineor
tolicenseavtAlphaorvtVAXVMasitismigratedfromonehosttoanotherinavirtualizedenvironment.
Alternatively, a small vtLicense server that manages multiple licenses can be
purchased and attached to the network. It is assigned a network address and can
control licensing for all of the virtual vtAlphas and vtVAXs in the network. Multiple
vtLicense servers can be configured in a network for redundancy should one fail.
vtLicense servers with production and disaster-recovery keys allow the licensed
software tocontinue in operation following afailover to a backupsystem or following
amigrationofaVMinavirtualizedenvironment.
