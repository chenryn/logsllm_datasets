New York City’s New 911 System Goes Down Four Times
June2013
After limping along for decades on an aging 911 Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) system, New York City
finally commissioned a new, state-of-the-art 911 system as part of the Bloomberg Administration’s USD
$2billionupgradeofthecity’semergencycommunicationsinfrastructure.Thenew911system underwent
extensive testing prior to its inauguration, but this did not prevent it from failing four times in its first three
daysofoperationduringlateMay,2013.
A New 911 System After Forty Years
Back in the early 1970s, New York City installed a then state-of-the-art CAD system to handle its 911
emergencies. The system was a green-screen, mainframe-based system that was a modification of an
airlinereservationsystem.
Time passed, and 9/11 happened. NYC realized that it needed to make major improvements to its
emergencycommunications system and initiated a USD $2 billion program to do this. The plans included
a new $630 million call center to combine the operations of police, fire, and medical dispatchers and
additional funds for an upgraded 911 system to route emergency calls to the dispatchers. The disaster

Alabama-based Intergraph was selected in
2008 and was awarded a USD $73 million
contract to provide the new web-based 911
system. The Intergraph 911 system is an
existing product that is used by 2,500 agencies
aroundtheworld.
The system is designed to immediately record
the location of the emergency caller based on
the land-line number or mobile GPS
coordinates. It recommends the deployment of
resources based on incident location and
vehicle location, unit type, drive time, officer
skillsandavailabilites,andotherinformation.
Thesystemtapsintostateandlocaldatabasestocheckforarrestwarrantsandpriorcallsfromthecalling
location. It creates interactive maps for the dispatchers. The maps show subways, schools, and other
landmarks. In a year or so, plans call for the system to support digital dispatch and to provide automatic
vehicle location to aid the dispatchers in deploying emergency services. Ultimately, all dispatch
informationwillbesenttothecity’spolicecars.
The Intergraph system is able to interoperate with other 911 systems in the region. It is designed to ease
the city’s migration to the next-generation 911 (NG-911) systems that will use VoIP (Voice over Internet

Protocol) for much of the city’s communications, thus relieving a good deal of traffic from the city’s land
mobile-radionetwork.
Intergraph began extensive testing of NYC’s new 911 system in late 2012. The system was tested for six
months, and almost 5,000 employees were trained. The system finally went live onWednesday, May 29,
2013,at3:15AMEST.
Infant Mortality
The system didn’t last long. Just a half day after its inauguration, it crashed. And then crashed again –
andagain–andagain.Itcrashedfourtimesinjustalittleovertwodays.Somuchforexhaustivetesting.
TheFirstOutage
At 4:21 PM on May 29th, just a half-day after its commissioning, the system unexpectedly went down in
the city’s primary call center in downtown Brooklyn. The computers at the call center shut down, and
hundreds of screens went dark along with satellite terminals in other rooms where dispatchers listen to
policeandEMS(EmergencyMedicalService)radiostodeterminewheretosendemergencyresponders.
The outage shut down the links between the 911 call operators and the dispatchers. The dispatchers
figure out which precinct or neighborhood is involved in the emergency and which units to assign to the
response.
All calls coming in were answered, but the call operators had to scribble the emergency information on
paper slips and hand them to runners, who ran the slips to dispatchers in the NYPD (New York Police
Department)andtoEMSradiorooms.
The outage lasted for sixteen minutes. One longtime NYPD phone operator described those sixteen
minutesaspurepandemonium,astherewerenotenoughrunnerstokeepupwiththecallvolume.
TheSecondOutage
Intergraph teams worked through the night to determine the cause of the outage. They finally fixed the

The next morning, Thursday, May 30th, the system crashed again. This time it was down for six minutes,

The Writing on the Wall
New York City’s upgraded 911 system experienced problems from the start. The contract was initially
awarded to HP in 2002 for a total of USD $47 million. Reportedly, HP did not deliver a system to the

Intergraph was investigated as part of the contractual process by the New York Department of
Investigation. Disturbingly, the department issued clear “caution” warnings concerning Intergraph based
onpriorexperience.
In2004,Intergraphrolledoutanew911system for theSanJose,California, policeandfiredepartments.
The system had so many problems that a grand jury was convened to investigate the system and

Summary
It seems that this project suffered from several faults. First and foremost has to be inadequate testing.
PerhapsthecityshouldhavepaidmoreattentiontothepreviousIntergraphfailuresthatitsDepartmentof
Investigation had uncovered. This could have focused testing attention on areas in the product that had
proventobeweakinthepast.
Thereisalsothequestionofredundancy.A911systemiscertainlyamission-criticalsystemdeservingan
availability of four or five 9s (just minutes of downtime per year). Where was the redundancy that would
keepthesystemoperatingduringthesecomponentfailures?
A major error – true for any upgrade – was in not maintaining a path to return to the original known,
working system if problems occurred. There should have been a way to keep the original system
operational and on standby so that 911 operators and dispatchers could return to that system and use it
until the new system had undergone further testing in the areas of failure. As of this writing, there have
been no reported failures for two weeks. Is that enough to establish faith in the new system to the extent
thattheoriginalsystemcanbedecommissioned?Ithinknot.
Fortunately, the city had the ultimate backup – manual operation. According to the city administration, no
