United Airlines’ Bug Bounty Program
July2015
In January 2015, hackers accessed customer information from United Airlines
MileagePlus frequentflyers program.Thehackersbookeduptothreedozenflights using
mileage points from these accounts before United detected the attack. American Airlines AAdvantage
program was attacked at the same time, and information was stolen from about 10,000 American
customeraccounts.
Mileage Points for Security Flaws
United has now (as of May 2015) established a bug bounty program in which it will pay security
researchers (“white-hat” hackers) frequent flyer miles for information on security flaws. How much will it
pay?

Two Winners So Far
In just the few months that it has operated its bug bounty program, United already has awarded millions
of frequent-flyer miles to hackers who have uncovered gaps in the carrier’s web security. It has paid one

hacker to seize control of one of the airline’s websites. Under the terms of United’s bug bounty program,
Wiens had to disclose the bug to United without trying to exploit it. The agreement prohibits him from

disclosing the bug even after it had been corrected, a restriction that Wiens terms unfortunate because it

Summary
As it has always done, United continues to thoroughly test its systems for security; and it engages
cybersecurity firms to keep its websites secure. With the bug bounty program, researchers can flag
problems before malicious hackers can exploit them. United finds that this approach is less costly than
hiringoutsideconsultancies.
