Go Daddy Takes Down Millions of Web Sites
September2012
At about 10 AM EDT on Monday, September 10, 2012, companies and individuals around the world
began to lose their web sites and email services (the Availability Digest being among them). Ultimately,
anestimatedfifteenmillionwebsites andanuntoldnumber of emailaccounts sufferedfailureanddid not
recover until six hours later. Most of the web sites were those of individuals or small businesses. Small

Go Daddy Goes Down
This catastrophe was caused by an outage incurred by Go
Daddy. Go Daddy is a major Internet domain registrar and
web-hosting company. It is the largest registrar in the world,
having registered more that 45 million domain names, four
timesmorethanitsnearestcompetitor.
Withover USD $1billioninrevenue,GoDaddyhosts morethanfivemillion web sites onits server farms.
It caters to small businesses and individuals with very little web experience by providing them with easy-
to-usetoolstobuildtheirwebsites.
It became obvious earlyon that the problem was with Go Daddy’s DNS (Domain Name System) servers.
Theywerelargelyinaccessible.Withnoaccess toits DNSservers,domainURLsmanagedbyGoDaddy
could not be converted to IP addresses, and those web sites and email domains therefore could not be
reached.NotonlywerethewebsitesandemailaddresseshostedbyGoDaddyinaccessible,butsowere

servers.
What Caused the Outage?
Thebigquestion was what hadtakenGoDaddy’s DNSservers down?As thedayprogressed,GoDaddy
information and press investigations went through a series of conclusions, each being discredited as the
nexttheorytookform.
AnAnonymousDDoSAttack
The first conjecture was that Anonymous, a group of loosely-affiliated individuals that participate in major
hacking attacks, were behind a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack byflooding Go Daddy’s DNS
serverswithconversionrequests.

Anonymous had opposed Go Daddy’s support of SOPA (the Stop Online Piracy Act) intended to protect
online copyrights. Opponents claimed that SOPA would hobble the open nature of the Internet and open
the door to online censorship. In fact, many customers left Go Daddy in protest. In an open letter,
Anonymous claimed that support of SOPA made Go Daddy an enemy of the Internet and an enemy of
Anonymous.Itendedwiththethreat,“GoDaddy,Expectus.”

AnonymousOwn3r
However, as this theory was gaining credibility, tweets from an individual who identified himself as
AnonymousOwn3r claimed responsibility. AnonymousOwn3r insisted that he was acting on his own, that
the outage was indeed caused by his DDoS attack, and that Anonymous had nothing to do with the
attack. After an article by TechCrunch blaming Anonymous, AnonymousOwn3r sent a tweet to
TechCrunchdemanding“please edit it[the TechCruncharticle] theattack is not comingfrom Anonymous
coletive[sic],theattackit’scomingonlyfromme.”
It has never been determined who AnonymousOwn3r is, but he has claimed to be Brazilian. His tweets
arecharacterizedbybrokenEnglishfilledwithtypos.
Though AnonymousOwn3r never provided any evidence to support his claim, the news journals and
blogs widely reported his involvement. In response to a question about whether he took down the entire
GoDaddyDNSsystem,heresponded,“yes! it’snotsocomplex.…whenidosomeDDOSattack iliketo
letitdownbymanydays,theattackforunlimitedtime,itcanlastonehouroronemonth.”
When asked why he initiated the attacks, he offered no clear reason: “i’m taklng godaddy down because
willi’dliketotesthowthecybersecurityissafeandformorereasonsthaticannottalknow.”
GoDaddyNetworkingFault
While all of the conjecture as too who was behind the outage was going on in the press, Go Daddy was
busy getting to the root cause of the outage. They finally got service restored about 4 PM EDT and
announced that the outage was notcaused bya DDoSattack atall. Rather, it was an internal networking
problem that caused corruption of routing tables directing traffic to its DNS servers. Because of the faulty
routing,theDNSserverscouldnotbereached.
During the outage, Go Daddy made one repair. It moved its DNS domain name to its biggest competitor,
VeriSign, so that the Go Daddy site was accessible. This, however, did nothing for the other millions of
websitesandemailaddressesthatweredown.
GoDaddy’s Apology
GoDaddy’sCEO,ScottWagner,issuedthefollowingletterofapology:
“We owe you a big apology for the intermittent service outages we experienced on September 10th
thatmayhaveimpactedyourwebsiteandyourinteractionwithGoDaddy.com.
“The service outage was due to a series of internal network events that corrupted router data tables.
Once the issues were identified, we took corrective actions to restore services for our customers and

Summary
Go Daddy’s outage illustrates that with all of its redundancy, the Internet is nevertheless a fragile
ecosystem. The Availability Digest’s Never Again stories are loaded with instances of Internet outages.
Companies must have a plan for continuing their business in the absence of the Internet or be willing to
facetheconsequences.
