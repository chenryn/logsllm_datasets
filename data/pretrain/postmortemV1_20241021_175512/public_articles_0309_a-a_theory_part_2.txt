Active/ActiveSystems
In an active/active system, there is a failover should either node fail. Some node in a dual-node
active/active system will fail every mtbf/2 hours. Therefore, the probability of users being down
due to a failover is (2 mtfo)/mtbf. However, only half of the users are affected. Therefore, the

Failover Faults
Failover is a complex process. As system upgrades are made, will the current failover process
stillwork?Areallcomponentsattherequiredrevisionlevel?Arethescriptsstillcurrent?
Failover should be frequentlytested to makesure that it still works.However, failing over amajor
system is not only expensive, but it is dangerous. For one thing, users will be down during the
failover test. They may have to brought down again if the system must be failed back to the
originalconfiguration.
Even worse, there may be problems in the failover with equivalent problems when a failback is
attempted.Usersmaybedownforanextendedperiodoftimeastheseproblemsareworkedout.
Consequently, failover testing is often not done frequently or thoroughly. The result is that a real
failoverattemptmayfail.Thisiscalledafailoverfault.
Again, the analysis of system downtime due to failover faults is slightlydifferent for active/backup
systemsandforactive/activesystems;buttheresultsarethesame.
Active/BackupSystems
Let

active X backup
If the backup node fails, there will be no failover and therefore
node node
nofailoverfault.However,iftheactivenodefails,therewillbea
failover; and therefore there will be the possibility of a failover
fault. FailoverFault
The probability that the active node will fail is (1-a). The probability that the resulting failover
attempt will fail is d. Therefore, the probability that the system will be down due to a failover fault
is
probability(failoverfault)=(1-a)d (6)
Active/ActiveSystems
In an active/active system, a failover will occur should either node in a dual-node system fail.
Therefore, a failover will occur twice as often as it will in an active/backup system. However, only
half the users will be affected. Therefore, the probability of the system being down due to a
failoverfaultisthesameasforanactive/backupsystem;andEquation(6)holds.

It maybe tempting to say that failover faults are not a factor in system availability. After all, if the
failover fault probability is, say, 1%, and if a node is expected to fail on the average of once per
year, the system will experience a failover fault only once every one hundred years. We will see
inthefollowingexamplesthatthisisfalsereasoning.
System Failure Probability
SubstitutingEquations(4),(5),and(6)intoEquation(3),wehavetheprobabilitythatadual-node,

Equation (8) states that the dual-node system acts likeone node with an availabilityof a and one

That is, the effects of failover and failover faults directly affect the availability of the system once

node active/active system using fault-tolerant nodes with four 9s availability (such as HP’s
NonStopservers).

Note that the bulk of the failure probability is due to failover and failover faults. It reduces the
inherent availability of the system (the probability that it will fail due to a dual-node failure) by a
factorofover30:1.
ISSActive/ActiveSystem
In an active/active system, we can assume that failover faults will not happen. This is because
users at the failed node are failing over to a node that is known to be operational since this node
is, in fact, providing application functions to its users.4 In addition, failover is very fast –

Then

probability(failoverfault)=(1-.999)(.01) 0.0x10-6
1.2x10-6
The active/active system availability is 0.9999988, or a little less than six 9s, an order of
magnitudebetterthantheequivalentcluster.Theinherentavailabilityofthetwo-nodesystem has
been reduced by a factor of 1.2 rather than by a factor of over 30 in the cluster configuration.

NonStopActive/ActiveSystem
Assume the following parameters for an active/active system built with NonStop fault-tolerant
nodes:
a .9999
mtr 4hours
mtfo 3seconds
d 0
Then
probability(dual-nodefailure)=(1-.9999)2 1.0x10-8

probability(failoverfault)=(1-.9999)(.01) 0.0x10-8

The NonStop active/active system availability is 0.99999997, or a little less than eight 9s.

From this comparison, it is clear that active/active systems achieve their high availabilities
because of their failover characteristics. Not only do they fail over very quickly compared with
active/backupandclusterconfigurations,buttheyarerelativelyimmunefromfailoverfaults.
In fact, active/active systems do not really fail over. They simply resubmit the failed work to a
known operating node. Resubmission may be done externally by the client or internally by the
system. The bottom line is that active/active systems achieve their high availabilities via the
philosophyof
Letitfail,butfixitfast.
“Fixitfast”isachievedbythetechniqueof
Resubmitratherthanfailover.
