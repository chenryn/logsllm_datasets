So You Think Your System is Reliable?
January2008
The abundance of system failures causing major impacts overwhelms our Never Again column.
Earlier this year, we published a summary of several major outages to try to catch up with the
news.1 In this article, we continue that tradition and give brief summaries of many significant
systemoutagesthatoccurredduringthesecondhalfof2007.
Therearesomeinteresting lessons to learn from theseexperiences. Of thetwenty-one instances
reported below, seven were due to power problems. We see this as a recurring theme. Also,
another seven of the instances had to do with satellite branches – train stations, airports, and
motor vehicle bureaus. It seems that we often don’t extend our notions of uptime beyond the
centralfacility.
There was one case in which a failure cost billions of dollars when Samsung’s chip line went
down. Then there was the VoIP provider Skype that went down for days when its network
overloaded trying to handle millions of simultaneous end-user software upgrades. What about
Cisco? Even an acknowledged leader in network redundancy can go down. And there was the
lowly PC that kept thousands of arriving international passengers on planes for hours at the Los
Angelesairport.
FiberNet’sNightmare

IP services to 24,000 customers, mostly businesses. On July 10, 2007, 11,000 of its customers
suddenly lost service. The problem was traced to a failed digital crossconnect system box. All
efforts to return the system box to service failed. FiberNet finally had to order and install a new
system box. Service wasn’t restored for two days. FiberNet is now reengineering its systems to

www.wthr.com – Indiana residents showing up early Saturday morning, July 14, 2007, to renew
their car registrations and drivers’ licenses found long lines building because the computers at all
141 Bureau of Motor Vehicle branches were not working. The problem was not in the BMV
systems. The Indiana government’s statewide computer had crashed due to a failed router.
Fortunately,it was aSaturday;andof allthestate’s offices onlythe BMVbranches were openfor

SanFranciscoPowerOutageTakesDownLargeWebHostingService
www.news.com – On July 25, 2007, transformer breakers at a San Francisco Pacific Gas and
Electric power station unexpectedly opened, causing a power surge that cut off all electricity to a
portion of the city. Power was lost to several data centers, including the San Francisco data
center run by 365 Main, a large hosting company. 365 Main hosts web sites for such companies
as Craig’s List and Second Life. Three out of ten of 365 Main’s power generators did not start

supported web sites were offline for several hours after city power was restored while the web
siteswererecovered.
RAID5FailureTakesWebSiteOutforDays
www.imaging-resource.com – Imaging Resource provides Web-based digital imaging services.
On Friday, July 27, 2007, its Web server suffered a RAID 5 drive failure that took down the
system. How could this happen? RAID 5 is supposed to survive any single disk failure. Well, not
quite. In this case, the drive failed in such a waythat it took down the SCSI bus and corrupted all
the drives. No problem. The company had used a backup service provided by its ISP, but this
serviceturnedouttobehighlyunreliable.As aresult,itwasn’tuntilSunday, three days later,that

RadarFailureDelaysFlightsatCincinnatiAirport
www.wepo.com – A loss of power left the radar system at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky
International airport down for three hours on Sunday, July 29, 2007. The problem occurred when
a power supply driving the radar antenna motor failed. Though two motors, each with a separate
power supply, were available, the backup motor did not kick in. The airport’s air traffic controllers

PowerOutageTakesDownSamsungChipProductionLine
english.donga.com – Due to a problem at a transformer substation in early August of 2007, a
power outage at a Samsung Electronics chip plant located in Yongin, China, forced the world’s
largest chipmaker to halt production. This was the first time ever that Samsung has had to shut
down its chip production line due to a power failure. Though the plant’s uninterruptible power
supplystarted properly, the brief power outage meant that all wafers had to be removed from the
production line. It took days to return to normal operation. The outage was expected to cost
Samsungtensofbillionsofyuan(billionsofdollars).
LighteningStrikeBoilsWaterinNorthJersey
www.northjersey.com – At about 9 pm Friday, August 6, 2007, a lightning strike knocked out
power toUnitedWater’s Haworth water treatmentfacilityin northern NewJersey. Thecompany’s
diesel-powered backup generator immediately came to life, and water treatment continued.
Lightning never strikes twiceright?Wrong.Shortlyafterwards, asecond lightening strikefriedthe

HeatWaveTakesOut AnotherWaterSupply
www.independentmail.com – North Jerseyans could sympathize with some South Carolinians
when water pressure suddenly dropped for almost an hour in Anderson, South Carolina, on
August 10, 2007. Duke Energy, which supplies power to that area, compensates companies that
willusetheir ownbackuppower generators when electricaldemandexceeds Duke’s capacity.As
a result of a heat wave, Duke Energy asked Anderson Regional Joint Water System to switch to
backup power at its Lake Hartwell Water Treatment Facility. Unfortunately, the backup generator
failed; and the plant could not pump water. Water pressure had to be supplied by the company’s
watertanks.Theresultwas45minutesoflittleornowaterpressureforthousandsofresidents.

Custom’sGlitchStrandsThousandsofPassengersonPlanesatLAX
www.latimes.com – An outage in a U.S. Customs Service computing system caused 17,000
inbound passengers to be held on planes for up to nine hours at Los Angeles’ Tom Bradley
International Terminal on August 11, 2007. An additional 16,000 outbound passengers were
similarly delayed. The problem started with a malfunctioning network interface card in a desktop
computer. The card provided a gateway to the Custom Service’s local area network, and its

EvenCiscoCanHaveOutages
www.crn.com – On Wednesday, August 15, 2007, Cisco’s web site went down when its San
Jose, California, data center lost power due to a maintenance error. Among other service
outages, this prevented Cisco solution providers from configuring Cisco systems.The failure was
particularly embarrassing to Cisco since it is a leader in high-end enterprise networking, load
balancing,andredundancy.DoesCisconotfollowitsownadvice?
UsersCrashSkype
www.msnbc.com – Thursday, August 16th, 2007, was just another user update day for Skype, a
major VoIP Internet telephone service provider. With 220 million users, Skype has 5 to 6 million
users online at any one time. On this day, Skype sent software update notices to all of its
currently online users – all six million of them. The massive restart of user computers around the
world within a very short timeframe caused a flood of log-in requests and overloaded Skype’s
network resources. The result – Skype was down from Thursday through Saturday, leaving its
customerswithonlyPOTS(plainoldtelephoneservice).
WellsFargoOnlineServicesDownforTwoDays
albuquerque.bizjournals.com – On Sunday afternoon, August 19th, 2007, Wells Fargo’s online
services suddenly went down due to a software glitch. Though a backup system took over, the
software bug had also infected the backup system. Problems stretched across the Wells Fargo
enterprise. Customers could not access ATMs, conduct wire transfers, or use their debit cards.
The problems stretched into Monday until the system was finally returned to service. However, it
took until Tuesday for the bank to catch up with processing. This resulted in customers seeing
end-of-dayFridaybalancesratherthancurrentbalances.

asia.cnet.com – Commuters in metropolitan Tokyo faced a rude surprise on Friday, October 12,
2007. Ticket gates would not open when magnetic-striped ticket cards were inserted. Over 1,300
gate machines in 192 stations were inoperable. The problem was a log-in problem. Each
morning, the gate machines log in to a central server to get a list of invalid cards. The log-in

NevadaDMVDownforDays
news.rgj.com – Motorists at branches of the Division of Motor Vehicles in Nevada circled parking
lots as they waited for someone to leave and open up a parking space on Tuesday, November
13, 2007. But that hardly ever happened. The DMV computer had crashed following an upgrade
that weekend. Though it would periodically come online, it would crash again. Hundreds of
customers waited hours to register their cars, renew their drivers’ licenses, or pay their fees.
Others were sent home without being able to complete their transactions. Problems continued
throughWednesday.Itwasn’tuntilThursdaythatoperationsreturnedtonormal.
PoliceandFireRadiosCrash
www.miamiherald.com – The police radio system in Broward County, Florida, went silent for two
hours on November 14, 2007. The problem was caused by an electrical malfunction and was
compounded when the agency’s backup generator also failed. The failure not only shut down
every police and fire department in the county, but it also took down neighboring communication
systems in Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale. Fortunately, the county’s 911 system is an
independent system and was not affected. During the outage, police officers were dispatched by
cellphone.
AirCanadaCheck-InDelayedforHours
www.canada.com – EarlyFridaymorning, November 16, 2007, Air Canada passengers suddenly
found that they could not check in via the Internet or at the airport kiosks. A communication
problem had effectively disconnected the airline’s central reservation system from its computers
in airports across Canada. Massive line-ups of passengers snaked through terminals as agents
struggled to check in passengers manually. Air Canada was forced to cancel sixteen domestic
and international flights and delay many others. The system was not restored until midday. A
major complaint of passengers was that Air Canada did not keep them informed as to what was
happening.
UnitedCheck-In–DéjàVu
www.chicagotribune.com – No sooner had Air Canada’s online check-in services been restored
than United’s failed. United passengers at airports around the U.S. found that they could not
check in online or at airport kiosks for seven hours on Friday, November 30. Long lines
