– Our March Twitter Feed of Outages
March2016
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass. With our new Twitter presence, we don’t have to feel
guilty.Thisarticlehighlightssomeofthetweetsthatmadeheadlinesinrecentdays.
Cyberattacksbeginningtoaffectmobileservice,too,studysays
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are beginning to show up as a cause of mobile phone
outages, according to respondents of a recent survey. Fifty-four global Mobile Network Operators
(MNO) were polled on their experiences with outages and service degradations. The survey found

TheReasonSpaceXKeepsAbortingLaunches
In February within a four-day period, SpaceX aborted three attempts to launch the SES-9
satellite. The aborts bode ill for a company that is hoping to demonstrate a speedy and
predictable pace of rocket launches in 2016. After bad weather on the first attempt, the last two
failures to launch were linked to the upgraded rocket SpaceX is using. The rocket relies on
“superchilled” liquid oxygen to get an extra thrust into orbit.

TheIRSHackWasTwiceasBadasWeThought
On 26 February, for the second time in six months, the Internal Revenue Service revised its
estimate of the scale of a cyber attack on its systems, announcing that a total of about 724,000
individuals may have had their personal information stolen by hackers last year. That’s more
than twice as many as the agency said were impacted after an investigation that concluded last
August – and a whopping six times larger than the original estimate of the damage.

Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service: ABeginner's Guide, Part 1 -- Virtualization Review
Recent events, ranging from terrorist attacks to weather emergencies, have many business and IT
planners concerned about the readiness of their facilities and processes for unplanned interruptions
(aka disasters). While hypervisor vendors and their paid analysts have contended that high
availability trumps DR, that failover clusters eliminate the need for disaster recovery planning, more

While you don’t want to freeze in the winter, there’s a big difference between being toasty in your
home and being roasted alive. Yet some British Gas customers who have adopted Hive smart
thermostats were at the mercy of a glitch that sent temperatures soaring to nearly 90 degrees
Fahrenheit.

Even with everything we learned from the Y2K experience, many failures due to date and time bugs
still occur.However, products are available to thoroughlytest applicationsto ensure that they handle
critical dates and times successfully. These products are by and large noninvasive and require no

ThisisHowLeapYearCanRuinaDeveloper’sLife
February 29th presents a perfect trial fordevelopers. It enforces the idea that programmers must
take into account rare yet inevitable events in their application testing. How is it that this one extra
day can cause so much trouble? Most systems account for a 365 day year. If anything is set up on
an annual basis, it counts down from 365 and then repeats itself. But there are 366 days in a leap
year. If this isn’t taken into account, events might occur too early on the backend of an application –
or not at all. On the front-end, users might be served inaccurate data or become locked out of a
system.Thisiscertainlynottheexperienceforwhichanydeveloperwantstoberesponsible.

Several popular London travel apps informed commuters all Tube lines were down during
morning rush hour on 25 February. Transport for London (TfL) blamed a software bug for the
mass confusion. The glitch meant many of the most popular travel apps for smart phones were
showing all Underground lines as well as the Overground were running no services – just when
millions of people were leaving the house for work at around 8am.

2016:TheyearthebranchrouterwillRIP
2015 will likely be seen as the year when enterprises pushed aside their fears of cloud computing.
Over 70% of companies now utilise cloud-based applications and services, although these
companies still keep some critical systems and information stored in the data centre. The
widespread adoption of this hybrid IT infrastructure model will lead to 2016 becoming the year when

How to Survive the Zombie Apocalypse (and Other Disasters) with Business Continuity and
SecurityPlanning
Business interruptions come in all shapes and sizes. In today’s landscape, the lack of business
continuity planning not only puts companies at a competitive disadvantage, but it also can spell
doom for the company as a whole. Careful consideration of disaster recovery planning in the areas
of host configuration, defense, authentication and proactive monitoring will ensure the integrity of
your DR systems and will effectively prepare for recovery operations while keeping security at the
forefront.
