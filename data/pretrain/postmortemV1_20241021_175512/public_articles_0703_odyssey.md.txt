HP’s Project Odyssey – Migrating Mission Critical to x86
March2012
HP’s Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking (ESSN) Business Unit markets two lines of servers –
Proliantservers(acquiredfromCompaq)andIntegrityservers.ProliantserversarebasedontheIntelx86
Xeon processor and support Windows and Linux operating systems. Integrity servers are Itanium-based
andsupportHPmission-criticaloperatingsystems–HP-UX,NonStop,andOpenVMS.
Both Proliant and Integrity servers are available either as blades for HP’s BladeSystem or as rack-
mounted servers. Integrity servers are also available as Superdome 2 blades. Within ESSN, the
Business Critical Systems Division (BCS) focuses on delivering mission critical solutions to the market
includingIntegrity,NonStopandscale-upx86solutions(ProLiantDL980).
OnNovember22,2011,HPannounced1amajornewinitiativedubbed“ProjectOdyssey.”Itisintendedto
extend the mission-critical features of HP-UX from Itanium blades to Windows and Linux x86 blades.
Project Odyssey raises many questions for those involved with HP’s current highly available operating
systems–HP-UX,NonStop,andOpenVMS.Inthisarticle,theseconcernsareexplored.

ThemotivationforProjectOdysseywasexpressedbyMartininHP’spressrelease:
“Clients have been asking us to expand the mission-critical experience that is delivered today with
HP-UX on Integrity to an x86-based infrastructure. HP plans to transform the server landscape for
mission-critical computing by using the flexibilityof HP BladeSystem and bringing keyHP technology
innovations from Integrity and HP-UX to the x86 ecosystem. Unlike the competition, HP offers an
open,integratedsingle-platformapproach.”
“Clients investing in a mission-critical Converged Infrastructure today with Integrity and HP-UX, if
desired,canevolvetoamission-criticalLinux/Windowsenvironmentinthefuture.”

As HP’s press release stated, organizations need the availability and resilience of UNIX-based platforms
but with the familiarity and cost-effectiveness of industry-standard platforms. By hardening Windows and
Linux on HP x86 blades, Project Odyssey will allow organizations in the future to run their mission-critical
applications on these operating systems using x86 blades. By using advanced technology across a
common,modular HP BladeSystem architecture,anorganization willbe abletochoosethe bestsoftware
andhardwareenvironmentthatisalignedtoitsneeds.
The effort to extend HP-UX innovations to mission-critical x86 blades in the c-Class blade enclosures is
code-named “HydraLynx.” Project Odyssey also will deliver blades with x86 processors to Superdome 2,
allowing Integrity and x86 blades to be intermixed in the same enclosure. This effort is code-named
“DragonHawk.” HydraLynx and DragonHawk enhancements are expected to be available within the next
twoyears.
By bringing select HP-UX innovations to mission-critical x86 blades, HP will enable clients running
WindowsorLinuxto:
 increase Superdome 2 scalability with 32-socket DragonHawk symmetrical processing x86
systemsthatwillscaletohundredsofcores.
 increase reliability and flexibility with two-, four-, and eight-socket HydraLynx scalable mission-
criticalx86serverbladesinc-Classenclosures.
 increaseavailabilityofLinuxapplicationswithServiceguardclusters.
 boost flexibility and availability of x86 systems with HP nPartitions (nPar) technology, which

What Does Project Odyssey Portend?
HP’s Project Odyssey announcement raises as many questions as it answers. Industry pundits have had
afielddayanalyzingthedirectioninwhichHPmaybeheading.
WhyProjectOdyssey?
Is Project Odyssey an attempt by HP to breathe life into a faltering Business Critical Systems Division,
hurt by Oracle’s decision to cease support for Itanium by 2018? The press supports this supposition
based on what Meg Whitman, new Chairperson of HP, said3 following the poor Q4 HP financial report4
(BCSrevenuedroppedby23%overthesameperiodlastyear):
“The BCS business is a declining business. It is a slow decline, but I don’t think you’re going to see
anacceleratinggrowthrate inthatbusiness.Andso wejusthavetomanagethat as bestwecanand
invest in R&D so we get to a new platform as fast as we possibly can that allows us to service the
clientsthatneedthiskindofpower.”
Is the “new platform” a mission-critical industry-standard x86 platform? In HP’s press release, Martin
referred to “an open, integrated single platform.” Is this a signal that the Xeon x86 chip family will
eventuallywinoutoverItanium?
Martin: No! The “open, integrated single platform” is the HP BladeSystem. This is the “new platform”
referenced by Meg Whitman. In one platform, all operating systems can be intermixed – Linux and
Windowsonx86andHP-UX,NonStop,andOpenVMSonItanium.

Customers may see HP putting x86 ahead of Itanium or Linux/Windows ahead of HP-UX. But HP points
out that the intent of Project Odyssey is to create x86 (Xeon)-based Integrity and Superdome blade
serverssuitableformission-criticalcomputing.HPwantstomakeWindowsandLinuxmorerobustsothat
theycan be usedalongsideor instead of HP-UX. If thereis a hardenedLinux, will there bea migrationof
HP-UXapplicationstoLinux?
Martin: Some companies will migrate because they see Linux as a cheaper and more versatile
environment. Some will not migrate,especiallyISVs whosimplydonot want to do yet another port of
theirapplications.HPisprovidingaroadmapthatwillallowcustomerstomaketherightchoice.There
will be nothing to coerce or to entice customers into migrating or staying with their current operating
systems.
I expect lots of mixed environments. Applications that customers are running today will remain on
their current operating systems for a very long time. New applications running Windows or Linux will
movetotheOdysseyplatform.

LorraineBartlett,HPVicePresidentofWorldwideMarketingStrategy,stated :
“We are absolutely committed to invest in HP-UX, OpenVMS, and NonStop operating systems and
Itanium platforms. … We want to retain the best … and build up the rest. And that is Linux and
WindowsonXeon.”
Meanwhile, according to Kirk Bresniker, Vice President and Chief Technologist for the BCS Division, HP
isworkingwithInteltogetthefeaturesthatHPneedsintofutureXeonprocessors.“Wearesystematically
evaluatingthearsenalofintellectualpropertyforHP-UXandmappingthattox86platforms.”
In taking a step to harden Linux, HP is planning to donate to the Linux kernel community (kernel.org)
some of the technology that makes the HP-UX and Superdome 2 platforms so reliable. However, are
there characteristics of HP-UX that might not be migrated to Linux and that would encourage companies
towanttostayonHP-UX?
Martin:Wearedoing adetailed gap analysis now. Though we can’tpredict what thefunctionalitygap
will be, we expect to get prettyclose to parity. It depends upon how much of the new capabilities are
moved to the HP software layer and how much goes into the Linux kernel, which we are donating to
kernel.org. It is not clear if kernel.org will resist any of the changes, but I don’t think that this will be
thecase.
IsProjectOdysseytheFirstStepinAbandoningItanium?
One industry pundit5 suggests that Martin Fink’s reference to a “single platform” signals that the Intel
Xeon chip family is going to win out in HP’s near future, probably meaning the end of the Itanium
developmentsfromIntelafteritsnexttwoprocessorrolloutsbecomeareality.
However,PaulineNistofIntel(howweatNonStopmissPauline)wroteinanIntelblog:6
“HP has finally responded to Oracle’s salvo of last March regarding Itanium. … The plan includes
delivering blades with Intel Xeon processors for the HP Superdome 2 enclosure … and the scalable
c-Class blade enclosures whilefortifyingWindows and Linux environments with innovations from HP-
UX within the next two years. … Intel remains equally committed to the Itanium and Xeon platforms,
both of which represent our portfolio approach to bringing open standards-based computing to the
mission-criticalmarketsegment.”

averylongtime–longafterhehasretired.
WillHP-UXbeMigratedtox86Blades?
In Martin’s statement, migration is not mentioned. He only mentions “bringing key HP technology
innovationsfromIntegrityandHP-UXtothex86ecosystem.”
Kate O’Neill, Product Marketing Manager for HP’s Business Critical Systems Division, has said7 that HP
is not now planning to port HP-UX to x86-based servers. “No, that’s not part of the news.” Was the
operativeword“now”intentional?
Martin: Kate is basicallysaying “Never say never.” At this point, there are no plans; and I predict that
it will never happen. The big problem is the software support and the ISV support for the 5,000
current HP-UX ISV applications. The better model is to bring the HP-UX capabilities to Linux rather
thanportHP-UXtox86.
WhatAboutNonStopandOpenVMS?
The only mention of NonStop and OpenVMS in HP’s press release was the statement that HP’s new
roadmap includes ongoing innovations to Integrity servers and to the HP-UX, NonStop, and OpenVMS
operatingsystems.
WhatistheFutureofHP’sMission-CriticalProprietaryOperatingSystems?
HP-UX,NonStop,andOpenVMSareallproprietaryoperatingsystemsownedandcontrolledbyHP.They
provide the utmost in system reliability and resiliency for mission-critical applications. If HP is successful
in improving the industry-standard Windows and Linux operating systems to provide the same level of
reliability, will its proprietary operating systems survive? If the demand for these operating systems
decline,willItaniumsurvive?
Martin:This is not anissue.Mostplanningcycles arefive years or less.Changes likethis takealong
time.Aslongas youandIarearound,we’llbesupportingHP-UXonItanium.
Summary
HP’s move to a hardened Windows/Linux x86 environment is similar to IBM’s strategy. IBM has been
supporting Linux on its mainframe for over a decade. Recently, it added Windows support via new x86
processor blades for its zEnterprise Blade Center Extension.8 IBM can now provide tight integration
betweenzOS,Linux,andWindowsapplicationsinthesameBladeCenterExtension.
Martin: IBM’s strategy is not at all like Project Odyssey. IBM’s Linux is a proprietary Linux.
Applications have to be recompiled to run on the mainframe. IBM’s strategy is to extend the reach of
themainframe,and its proprietaryLinux has notbeen all thatsuccessful.Project Odysseyis radically
differentbecausewedoeverythingwithoneopenplatform.
IBM’s proprietary operating system zOS has survived living alongside a hardened Linux. Hopefullythis is
an indication that the HP proprietary operating systems will survive alongside HP’s hardened Linux and
Windows.
If ProjectOdysseyis wildlysuccessful,itmaydrive ahugecompetitiveadvantage for HP.However,if HP
customers embracethemovetohighlyreliablestandardoperatingsystems,HP-UXmaybethefirsttogo
