Failure State Diagrams - Repair Strategies
October2007
Where We Left Off
In our September, 2007, Geek Corner article, Calculating Availability – Failure State Diagrams,
we introduced failure state diagrams as a formal way to derive availability relationships. A failure
state diagram contains nodes that represent various states of failure of a system and connectors
thatindicatewaysinwhichonestatemaytransitiontoanother.
Each connector is characterized by the rate at which its source state will transition to its target
state. In the steady state, the transition rates exiting a state must equal the transition rates
enteringastate.
For instance, Figure 1 shows a system with two states, S and S . The system will be in state S
1 2 1
with a probability of p , and it will be in state S with a probability of p . When in state S , the
1 2 2 1
system will transition to state S at a rate of r . Likewise, when the system is in state S , it will
2 1 2
transition to state S at a rate of r . Therefore, the total transition rate from state S to S is p r ;
1 2 1 2 1 1
andthetotaltransitionratefromstateS toS isp r .

only n-1 of them will be independent. Since we want to solve for n variables (the n probabilities),
we need one more equation. This equation is simply the observation that the probabilities must

Application of the Failure State Diagram to Repair Strategies
IntuitiveAnalyses
In our November, 2006, article entitled Calculating Availability – Repair Strategies, we intuitively
derivedtheavailabilityofasystemforsequentialrepairandforparallelrepair:
sequentialrepair There is only one repair person. Should multiple nodes fail, they are
repaired one at a time by the single repair person. Each node is
returned to service as soon as it is operational, at which time the
repairpersonmovesontothenextfailednode.
parallelrepair There are multiple repair personnel available. Should multiple nodes
fail,theyarerepairedsimultaneouslybydifferentrepairpeople.Each
nodeisreturnedtoserviceassoonasitisoperational.
Our intuitive arguments led to the following expressions for system availability for an n-node
systemwithonespare:
F1A n(n1)(1a)2 forsequentialrepair (1)

SequentialRepair
The failure state diagram for sequential repair is shown in Figure 2. The system comprises n
nodes. There is one spare node in the system. Therefore, the system will survive the failure of
anyonenode.Shouldanytwonodesfail,thesystemisdown.

There are three states in this system. In state S , all nodes are operational. In state S , one node
0 1
has failed; but the system continues in operation. In state S , two nodes have failed; and the
2
systemisdown.
A node failure in state S will cause a transition to state S . Each node fails at the rate of 1/mtbf
0 1
(i.e., if the nodal mtbf is 1,000 hours, each node will fail once every 1,000 hours). Therefore, in
state S in which n nodes are operational, the nodal failure rate will be n/mtbf. This is the rate at
0,
whichthesystemwilltransitionfromstateS tostateS .
0 1
When in state S , it will take a repair time of mtr to repair the node. Thus, the system will
1
transitionfromstateS backtostateS atarateof1/mtr.
1 0
Alternatively, while in state S , a second node could fail. In this case, the system will enter state
1
S , at which point the system is down. Since there are n-1 nodes operational in state S , the
2 1
transition rate to state S is (n-1)/mtbf. While in state S , one of the two downed nodes will be
2 2
repaired.Whenitisrepaired,thesystem willreturntostateS andwillonceagainbeoperational.

In the steady state, the transitions into and out of each state must be equal. This leads to the

and

These are the true expressions for the availability of a single-spared n-node system that uses
sequential repair. Note that they are equivalent to our intuitive Equation (1) except for the
denominator D. To the extent that the value of D departs from one, D represents the error in our
intuitiveapproach.
Dcanbewrittenas
Da2 na(1a)n(n1)(1a)2
[a2 2a(1a)(1a)2](n2)a(1a)[n(n1)1](1a)2
[a(1a)]2 func(1a)
1func(1a)
1
D is equal to 1 plus some function of (1-a). If (1-a) is small, func(1-a) can be ignored and D is
approximatelyequaltoone..Thus,wefindthattheaccuracyof theintuitiveapproachof Equation
(1) depends upon the nodal availability a being very close to one and therefore (1-a) being very
small. It also depends upon there being a modest number of nodes in the system. (More
specifically, it depends upon the quantity (n-2)a(1-a) being very small.) This is certainly the case
for the high-availability systems in which we are interested. Under these assumptions, D is
approximatelyone;andtheintuitiverelationshipholds.
If nodal availabilityis not close to one (sayless than two 9s), or if there are hundreds of nodes in
thesystem,themoreaccurateEquations(4)and(5)shouldbeused.

The analysis of parallel repair follows closely the above analysis of sequential repair. The failure

These are the true expressions for the availability of a single-spared n-node system that uses
parallel repair. Note that they are equivalent to our intuitive Equation (2) except for the
denominatorD.Drepresentstheerrorinourintuitiveapproach.
As discussed in the analysis of sequential repair, the accuracy of the intuitive approach of
Equation (2) depends upon the nodal availability a being veryclose to one and upon the quantity
n(1-a) being very small. Under these assumptions, D is approximately one; and the intuitive
relationshipholds.
Note that for a two-node system (n=2), D is, in fact, equal to one; and the intuitive Equation (2) is
accurate.
Summary
Ourintuitiveexpressionsforsystem availabilityunderdifferentrepairstrategiesarevalidprovided
that the nodal availability is high and that the number of nodes in the system is modest. This is
certainlythecasefortheredundantsystemswithwhichweareconcerned.
Shouldthese approximations notbevalid, then Equations (4) and(5) shouldbeusedtocalculate
theavailabilityofasingle-sparedsystem undersequentialrepair. Equations(6)and(7)shouldbe
usedtocalculatetheavailabilityofasingle-sparedsystemunderparallelrepair.
