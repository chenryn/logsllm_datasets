Active/ActiveArchitectures
Active/active architectures are supported by Replicate’s bidirectional replication. To implement
bidirectional replication, two replication threads are configured on the same Replication Server. Each
replication thread transfers changes from one database to the other but in opposite directions. Thus, a
change madetoeither databaseis replicatedtothe other database;andboth databases reflectthesame
applicationstate.Therefore,atransactioncanbesenttoeithernodeandbeprocessedinthesameway.
The transaction load is shared between the nodes. Should one node fail, all that needs to be done is to
reroute alltransactions to thesurvivingnode.Recoveryfrom anoutagecanbe accomplishedinseconds,
therebyensuringtruecontinuousavailability.
The detection and resolution of data collisions (both nodes updating the same data object at the same
time)isnotcurrentlysupported.However,thisfunctioninontheReplicateroadmap.
WebInterfaces
AttunityReplicate is configured and managed by web interfaces. These functions can be performed via a
webbrowserfromanylocation.
The Click-2-Replicate Designer is used to configure replication. The Attunity Replicate Console monitors
andmanagesareplicationconfiguration.
Click-2-Replicate
The Click-2-Replicate web service allows the user to define the structure of the replication channel via a
simpledrag-and-dropGUI.
The database schemas for the source and target databases are used to configure replication. The
columns to be replicated are selected, and the transformations required between columns are specified.
Rowcontentfilteringcanbedefined.
When the definition of the replication channel is complete, the resulting Replicate configuration can be
deployed.
AttunityReplicateConsole
The Attunity Replicate Console web service is used to monitor and manage Replicate instances in real
timefromawebbrowser.
Tasks can be started, stopped, and reset at any time from any location. As a monitoring service, the
Replicate Console acts as a real-time dashboard. It displays such information as the change throughput,
thereplicationlatency,andthenumbersofreplicatedinserts,updates,deletes,andmetadatachanges.
The Replicate Console also displays alerts about the status of the replication channel and the various
replicationtasks.

ActivityLog
Replicate provides an activity log of all actions taken to configure and manage the replication channel as
well as all alerts generated concerning the status of the replication channel. The log supports the
integrationofReplicatewithenterprise-managementsystems.
SupportedDatabases
Replicate supports replication between several relational and non-relational databases as well as
replicationbetweenon-premisesystemsandcloudsandreplicationtodatawarehouses.

A CDC Capture agent runs on the source system. It reads changes from the source system’s change log
andidentifiesthosechangesthatmustbeforwarded.Itsendsthesechangestoastagingarearunningon

Inthestaging area,aRouter applies intelligentfilters andstores theresultingchanges inChangeTables.
From there, the changes are available for consumption by outside services. These external services
include Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) utilities, Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) utilities,
Business Process Management (BPM) utilities, Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) utilities,
Complex Event Processing (CEP) utilities, and homegrown applications driven by JMS (Java Messaging
Services),MQSeries,oranEnterpriseServiceBus(ESB).

Summary
Replicate is a powerful data replication engine that can be used to synchronize homogeneous and
heterogeneous databases. The databases may be relational or non-relational. Powerful transformation
facilities support the conversion of source database formats to those of the target database. All DML and
DDLchangescanbereplicatedwithreplicationlatencymeasuredinsecondsorsubseconds.
The initial target database can be created and loaded without having to pause the source applications.
Web-service GUI consoles are provided to initially define and deploy the replication channel and then to
monitorandmanageit.
Replicate Replication Server appliances can be multithreaded to provide scalability. Multiple Replication
Servers can be provided to meet any capacity requirements and to provide redundancy to avoid single-
points-of-failureinthereplicationchannel.
Several topologies are supported, including active/active systems for continuous availability. Replicate
supportstheintegrationofon-premisesystemstocloudservices.
Replicate is currently deployed to offload production systems by moving process-intensive functions to
other systems, to provide disaster recovery to remote data centers, and to feed data warehouses, data
marts,andExtract,Transform,andLoadutilities,amongmanyotheruses.
