That number was a huge understatement. After further investigation by the U.S. Government, the people
whosepersonalinformationwasstolennumbers21.2million!
Not One, But Two Attacks
It turns out that there were two hacking attacks. They began in early 2014 when hackers infiltrated the
systems of government contractor KeyPoint Government Solutions and stole employee credentials.

One set of hacked databases was the OPM repository of security clearance files. They included every
security clearance application submitted since the year 2000. The data is submitted via the SF86 form, a
120-page application submitted by anyone seeking a government security clearance. The stolen data
includes sensitive information on virtually every aspect of peoples’ personal histories, including financial
records, outstanding debt, gambling addictions, drug use, alcoholism, arrests, psychological and
emotional health, foreign travel, foreign contacts, and an extensive list of relatives and friends. The

The attackers also hacked databases with personnel records. They were active in these databases until
April 2015 when the attacks were discovered by the OPM. Information compromised included Social
Securitynumbers,jobassignments,andperformanceevaluations.About4.2millionpeople wereaffected

By the time the OPM concluded its damage assessment, it discovered that the majority of those affected
were those who had entries in the OPM repository of security clearance files. Eliminating duplicates of
people who had informationin bothsets of databases,the governmentdeterminedthatthe informationof
21.2 million people was compromised. These victims include not only those who are working for, have
worked for, or have tried to work for the U.S. government but also their family and friends who had been
listedasreferences.

Notification is Lagging
The OPM is offering a “comprehensive suite of monitoring and protection services” to those impacted.
Servicesincludethreeyearsofcreditmonitoringandotheridentity-protectionoptions.
The OPM also is setting up a new system to inform victims of the securitybreach. So far,most of the 4.2
million people exposed in the one hacking attack have been notified. However, it may take weeks to get
the notification system working before the other 18 million people are notified. OPM is facing rising anger
from thefederalemployeeunions,whichareclaimingthattheyhavereceivedscantinformationaboutthe
breaches.
Up to this time, there has been no indication to suggest any misuse of the stolen information. However,
notmuchtimehaspassed.
OPM Director Resigns
Under pressure from members of Congress to step down, Katherine Archuleta, the Director of OPM,
resigned. She offered her resignation of her own volition and not because she was asked for it. The
pressure for her to leave was in spite of the fact that the attacks were discovered as a result of the
strategiccybersecurityplansheputinplaceinNovember2014,shortlyaftershebecameDirector.
Summary
Amajorsecurityproblem thatOPMfaces is that its databases arestoredonforty-seven differentservers,
some operated by OPM and others operated by contractors. The servers are old and applications are
written in old languages such as COBOL. Upgrading these systems is next to impossible, but replacing
themcouldtakeyears.Congresshasyettoauthorizeanyfundsforsuchreplacements.
However, even if all systems were upgraded, hackers continue to prove that they are smarter than us.
Systems will continue to be hacked and data stolen. The only certain defense (well, almost certain) is to
