During that hour, the prices for thousands of items crashed to one pence (about a U.S. penny). The
cause – a software glitch in a third-party application used by thousands of small Amazon sellers. The
application provides automatic pricing adjustments to ensure that the seller’s products are priced
competitively.Thethird-partysoftwarefirmisaU.K.company,RepricerExpress.
Word of the “great deals” spread rapidly via Twitter. Buyers were delighted. Sellers were appalled. The

The Pain is Felt
To obtain fast shipping, many companies stock their products in Amazon’s warehouses. From there,
Amazon ships products directly to customers with shipping times as little as one day. Thus, there is little

time between when an order is placed and when Amazon’s computers begin the shipping process, a
processthatevidentlycannotbeinterrupted.
Someoftheheart-wrenchingstoriesofthosesellersaffectedinclude:
Martin Le Corre manages the online store MB Housewares. The store sells toys and games on Amazon.
Mr. Le Corre received a call from a competitor questioning why he was selling his products for as low as
1p. He immediately checked, and found out that his store had received 1,600 orders in one hour. People
were buying 10, 50, 100 copies of everything. Mr. Le Corre immediately took his store offline and
contacted Amazon. Amazon had already shipped GBP £30,000 of products and could not cancel any of
theshipments.Mr.LeCorreestimateshislossescouldamountto£100,000.
Stephen Palmer sells TVs and mobile phones on his online store, TV Village. One customer ordered 59
mobile phones at 1p each. Even though Mr. Palmer notified Amazon right away, orders were still being
marked by Amazon as dispatched from its distribution center 24 hours after he called to try to stop
shipment. Mr. Palmer was one of the luckyones. He did not have much stock in the Amazon warehouse
as normal because of the run-up to Christmas. He was arranging for next-daydeliveryfrom his office. He
lost only £1,600. The glitch could have cost him £100,000, which would have meant certain bankruptcy
forhisstore.
Kiddymania, an online dress company, lost about £20,000. It received 675 orders for dresses that
normally cost up to £100 each for 1p. It asked Amazon to cancel the orders, but Amazon continued to
sendthemout,chargingthecompanyfortheshippingfees.
Craig Constantinides operates Go2Games, an online video-game retailer. He estimates losses of
£37,000. £11,000 of goods were sold for just £147. He now finds that he is dealing with thousands of
dissatisfiedcustomerswhohadtheirorderscancelled.
Richard Burri is a U.S. online retailer operating the Pens and Leather store. He notified Amazon after his
products started selling for 1p. However, he continued to receive shipping notifications with tracking
numbers. Amazon told him that there was no wayto cause the items to be rerouted back to Amazon. He
emailedcustomersbegging them toreturntheitems toAmazon.Hestatedthat ifcustomers wouldnotdo
this,andifneitherAmazonnorRepricerExpresstookresponsibilityfortheerror,hewouldbebankrupt.
Evidently, Amazon was having huge problems trying to stop items from being dispatched from its
warehouses.Itseemsthatoncethecomputerhasseteverythinginmotion,itishardtostop.
In addition to the huge losses suffered by the online stores, sellers were complaining that the orders that
hadbeencancelledwereruiningtheirsellerratings.
Amazon’s Response
Amazon takes a slice of each sale made on its web site. This income stream contributes to its annual
profitofUSD$20billionper year.
On Sunday, Amazon said it was working to stop any more 1p orders from being dispatched from its
warehouses. However, sellers were angry that they could not stop orders that had already been
dispatched. Even worse, they reported shipments were still being sent out on Monday afternoon, 72
hoursaftertheglitchoccurredFridaynight.
Inastatement,Amazonsaid,
“We responded quickly and were able to cancel the vast majority of orders placed on these affected
items immediately, and no costs or fees willbeincurredbysellers for these cancelled orders.Weare
now reviewing the small number of orders that were processed and will be reaching out to any
affectedsellersdirectly.”

“As of now, Amazon will not be providing anyreimbursements for this issue. You will need to contact
thethird-partysoftwareproviderwhoisresponsibleforthiserror.”
RepricerExpress’ Response
RepricerExpress offered its apologies, but it has offered no compensation to sellers for their losses.
BrendanDoherty,theCEOofRepricerExpress,stated:
“I am truly sorry for the distress this has caused our customers. We understand that you are angry
and upset, and we will endeavor to work to make good on this issue and to work to resolve your
confidenceinourproductandservice.”
Hewentontosay:
”We experienced a problem with RepricerExpress on Friday evening which caused incorrect pricing
to be sent to Amazon. We managed to get the problem resolved so that any new prices going to
Amazon were correct within about an hour of the problem being reported. It took a further few hours
togetincorrectpricesrevertedtotheiroriginalpriceswherepossible.
“Amazon have assured us that seller accounts will not be penalised for this issue. Amazon have also

“Again I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to our customers for this issue. We will

“One of the things all sellers can do to prevent this issue from happening again is to ensure that they

“We take a lot of pride in the levels of service we provide, so everyone here is disappointed that our

Again,onDecember18,itnoted:
“It has been widely publicised that pricing issues occurred in relation to a restricted number of
salesofgoodstothepublicusingtheRepricerExpressservice.
“RepricerExpress in conjunction with other interested parties are investigating the cause of the
issuesexperiencedandarefullycommittedtoaresolution.
“RepricerExpress are co-operating with all involved parties in seeking to determine a satisfactory
outcome and wish to inform sellers and the public alike that appropriate stepsare being taken to

Summary
RepricerExpress boasts on its web site that it provides “the ridiculously simple way to increase your
Amazonsales.”Itcertainlyprovedthatstatement,thoughinaverydisastrousway.
Neither Amazon nor RepricerExpress has offered any financial support for affected sellers. Moreover,
although several law suits have already been initiated against RepricerExpress, sellers have a concern
thatthesmallfirmwillcollapseundertheamountoftheclaims.
This incident demonstrates the danger of relying on automated software to control any function without
monitoring controls. Imagine an airliner control system that ordered full flaps while the airplane was
cruisingat500knots.Itwouldtearthewingsoffoftheplane.
In this case, it appears that there were two levels of monitoring that might have protected a seller. As we
mentioned earlier, one protection is that RepricerExpress provides on its dashboards parameters that
definetheminimum andmaximum prices atwhichan item canbesold.Perhaps this capabilitywas being
usedbysellersbutbecamedisabledbecauseofthesoftwarebug.
TheothermonitoringmeansisofferedbyAmazon.AsMr.Dohertynoted,
“One of the things all sellers can do to prevent this issue from happening again is to ensure that they
do not de-activate the pricing alerts facility provided by default by Amazon that prevents large pricing
