This is a preliminary Incident Report (Mini-IR). A Full Incident Report
with additional details is being prepared and will be posted at a later
date.

We apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may
have caused. We would like to provide some information about this
incident below. Please note, this information is based on our best
knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our
investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what

<https://cloud.google.com/support> .

(All Times US/Pacific)

**Incident Start:** 2022-07-19 06:33

**Incident End:** 2022-07-20 21:20

**Duration:** 1 day, 14 hours, 47 minutes

**Regions/Zones:** europe-west2

**Description:**

On Tuesday, 19 July 2022, a partial cooling failure in one of the
buildings that hosts the zone europe-west2-a impacted multiple Google
Cloud services. This resulted in some customers experiencing service
unavailability for impacted products. The cooling system impairment
began at 04:30 PDT, and was fully restored at 15:28 PDT. Google
engineers were engaged at 06:40 PDT after a rise in temperature was
noted by automated monitoring systems, and took a number of steps to
reduce thermal load in the datacenter before ultimately turning down
services and powering off servers in the affected zone at 09:04 PDT due
to temperature excursions. Engineering teams worked in shifts around the
clock to restore services once temperatures inside the datacenter
returned to acceptable levels, and inital restoration began at 14:13
PDT. Many services in the affected zone were available again by 20:24
PDT on 19 July 2022, and service restoration was complete on 20 July
2022 at 04:28 PDT. A small number of customers experienced residual
effects which were fully mitigated by 21:20 PDT on 20 July 2022.
Preliminary root cause has been identified as two separate chiller unit
failures, coupled with high ambient weather conditions, at one of the
buildings that hosts the europe-west2-a zone.

We sincerely apologize to our customers who were impacted by this
service disruption. Google and its suppliers are conducting a detailed
analysis of the cooling system failure which triggered this incident,
and Google engineers will subsequently conduct an audit of cooling
system equipment and standards across the data centers which house
Google cloud zones, to ensure that the lessons learned from this
incident are applied consistently at all locations.

    unavailability.

-   **Google App Engine and Cloud Functions:** Customers may have
    experienced high error rates for Google App Engine and Cloud
    Functions in europe-west2. Customers could failover to another
    region.

-   **Dataflow:** Some Dataflow streaming jobs running in the impacted
    area were stuck. Some new Dataflow jobs could not be initiated.

-   **Persistent Disk (PD):** Customers were unable to create PD devices
    in the impacted zone. Instances in the impacted zone were
    terminated, and therefore weren't able to access their PD devices. A
    small number of Replicated PD volumes experienced delays in the
    failover to a healthy zone.

-   **API Gateway:** Customers saw an elevated number of clone exits and
    spikes in europe-west2.

    which were single region (europe-west2). Customers also experienced
    a degraded experience if one domain controller remained unavailable
    due to zonal impact.

-   **Cloud Dataproc:** Customers were not able to create or scale up
    clusters in europe-west2-a. Some customers in europe-west2-c
    experienced elevated error rates during cluster creation and scale
    up. Customers were able to choose a different zone to create
    clusters.

-   **Cloud Bigtable:** Some customers in europe-west2 experienced
    service unavailability and elevated latency. Customer workloads
    using replicated databases with impacted replicas in europe-west2,
    could be moved to the region close to the other replicas to reduce
    latency.

-   **Datastream:** Datastream streams experienced errors and processing
    lag as a result of impact on the data-plane infrastructure and
    services. Customers were advised to run their streams in another
    region.

-   **Google Kubernetes Engine:** A proportion of clusters in
    europe-west2-a were fully unavailable, and nodepools for some
    regional clusters in europe-west2 were disrupted. Customers were
    encouraged to move their workloads to other regions if possible.
