massive defense spending by many countries. However, it has just taken its first step into
the real world. The Stuxnet worm, discovered last June by a security firm in Belarus
retained by Iran, is designed to attack and sabotage control systems used in power grids,
pipelines,nuclearplants,railroads,andotherfacilitiescontrolledbycomputers.
The power and flexibility of Stuxnet is evidenced by the fact that it evidently is focused on
Iran’s nuclear efforts. However, the technology behind Stuxnet is now public knowledge;
andthisleavesanycomputer-controlledfacilityopentohostileattack.
Stuxnet has so far spread to 155 countries, mostly Iran. You may be infected. If you are,
you probably don’t even know it. Stuxnet activates only if you are a control computer
configured in a very specific way. Otherwise, it will eventually delete itself from your
computer.
What is Stuxnet?
Stuxnet is a very targeted piece of malware. It looks for industrial control systems. When

Industrial systems are not controlled by the type of computers with which we are familiar.
Rather, they are controlled by a separate, dedicated system known as a SCADA
(Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system. These systems use firmware-based
cards known as PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers). PLCs are used to communicate
with, monitor, and control remote devices such as motors, valves, and switches, either
automatically or in response to operator commands. SCADA systems are typically not
connected to the Internet, only to private networks. Though security is a very big topic in
the SCADA industry, it is generally felt that these systems are very difficult to hack into

Stuxnet is ingenious. It has two major components. One intercepts valid commands being
sent to the PLCs and replaces them with potentially dangerous commands generated

automatically or by remote hackers. The other secretly records what normal operations at
the facility look like and plays these back to the plant operators so that it appears to them

Stuxnet is specifically designed to spin centrifuges such as those used in Iran’s nuclear
facilities out of control, potentiallydestroying them. If your computer is not controlling those
devices,the onlyimpactofStuxnetis that it willpropagateitself toother computers on your
internalnetwork.
How Does Stuxnet Spread?
It would be difficult to attack PLCs directlysince theyare not connected to public networks.
Furthermore, they are generally programmed in proprietary languages optimized for device
control.
Stuxnet sidesteps this problem by instead targeting the Windows-based systems that are
oftenused to oversee SCADAoperations.It enters a Windows system via an infectedUSB
thumb drive. Specifically, Stuxnet takes advantage of special files placed on thumb drives
to automatically execute itself as soon as the file is read by the operating system. Simply
browsinganinfectedthumbdrivecanloadStuxnetwithoutanyadditionaluserinteraction.
Thesemalware files are digitallysigned with the private keys of certificates stolen from two
different companies, JMicron and Realtek. This makes the files easily installable and
undetectable for a substantial period of time. The certificates have since been revoked by
Verisign.
Once installed, Stuxnet goes to work. In addition to disrupting the operation of the SCADA
system (ifinfactthatis the roleofthecomputer),italsocheckstoseeifthecomputer ison

Stuxnet provides connections to remote command and control servers manned by the
hackers. Two servers have been identified – one in Denmark and one in Malaysia – and

Stuxnet’s spread seems to have originated in Iran. It may have begun by giving an Iranian
plant operator an infected USB thumb drive or by simply leaving a few somewhere for
inquisitivepeopletoinsertitintotheircomputers.
What is known is that Stuxnet has now spread worldwide to about 100,000 computers.
Over 60% of these computers are in Iran. Next comes Indonesia and India. Only about 6%
are in the Western world, primarily in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia. Most of these
infectionsarebenign.
While Stuxnet is promiscuous, the attackers have taken great care to make sure that it is
onlytheir intendedtargets thatsuffer.If theappropriatecontrolsoftware is notfoundonthe

How Does Stuxnet Work?
The first thing that Stuxnet does is to search for industrial software made by German
industrial giant Siemans, a major manufacturer of control systems and the providers of the
SimaticWinnCCcontrollersusedbyIran’scentrifuges.Ifthesoftwareexistsandisproperly
configured, it inserts itself into theWinnCC Step7 module, which is the module that is used

to reprogram the firmware in the PLCs. It then reprograms the PLCs so as to include itself
inthefirmwareprograms.
Stuxnet intercepts legitimate commands being sent from the SCADA software to the PLCs.
If certain conditions are met, it replaces these commands with potentially dangerous
commands.Itthenreturnsanormalstatusreading,indicatingtotheplantoperatorsthatthe
controlleddeviceisoperatingproperlywheninfactitisnot.
Stuxnet is incredibly targeted. It requires specific variable-frequency motors to be attached
to the targeted Siemans controller. Furthermore, it attacks motors from only two
manufacturers, one located in Finland and one in Iran. It monitors the frequency of these
motors and attacks only those spinning between 807 Hz and 1210 Hz. When certain
conditions aremet,itperiodicallymodifies thesefrequencies to1410Hz,thento 2Hz,then
to 1064 Hz. This sequence can be very damaging to the motors. Stuxnet masks the
changes in rotational speed so that the plant operators are unaware of out-of-control
motors.
Stuxnet exploits four previously-unknown vulnerabilities in Windows to inject its code into
the PLCs. The first vulnerabilityallows executable code on a USB thumb drive to spread to
theWindowssystem.
The second vulnerability allows it to spread from machine to machine over a private
network and to let it report back to the attackers on the Internet when it finds a computer
thatisrunningtheSiemansSCADAsoftware.
The next two vulnerabilities let Stuxnet escalate its privilege levels so that it can inject its
codeintotheSiemansPLCs.
Russia has expressed intense concern for Stuxnet. In January, 2011, it called on NATO to
launch an investigation of Stuxnet when the worm targeted a Russian-built Iranian power
plant,saying the incidentcouldhavetriggered arepeatof the Chornobyl disaster,the 1986
nuclear meltdown in the Ukraine. Russia reported that Stuxnet caused centrifuges
producing enriched Uranium at the Bushehr plant to spin out of control. The operators
thoughtthatthecentrifugesappearedtobeworkingproperlyandtooknoaction.
Siemans has released a detection and removal tool for Stuxnet. However, deleting Stuxnet
from theWindows controlsystem does notremove itfrom thePLCs. Therefore,a thorough
auditofthePLCsisalsonecessary.
Who Did This?
Conspiracy theories abound. They focus mainly on a joint effort by the USA and Israel,
though all is purely conjecture. There is not a single element of evidence that links anyone
toStuxnet.
Stuxnetisunusuallylargeformalware–aboutahalfmegabyte–anditis writteninseveral
languages, including C and C++. It is so ingenious and requires the knowledge of somany
technologies that most securityspecialists feel that the development and testing of Stuxnet
was a massive, well-funded project, comprising perhaps ten to fifteen people over six
months or more. In addition, knowledge of industrial control systems was needed along
with access to such systems to do quality assurance testing, again indicating that this was
ahighlyorganizedandwell-fundedproject.

Stuxnet, named after initials found in its code, is the most sophisticated cyberweapon ever
created. It is a cybermissile apparently designed to take over the controls of the centrifuge
systemsatIran’suraniumprocessingcenterinNatanzanditsnuclearreactorinBashehr.
Several observations have led to different speculations concerning Stuxnet’s origin. In
2008, Siemans cooperated with the Department of Homeland Security to identify security
vulnerabilities in Siemans’ process control systems used by Iran’s enrichment facilities.
Siemans publicly announced these flaws later at a Chicago conference. It was these
securityholesthatwereexploitedbyStuxnet.WasthisdeliberatelyplannedbytheU.S.?
Then there are the “DaVinci Code” theories of symbology. Stuxnet contains a file named
“Myrtu.”ThismaybeanallusiontotheHebrewwordforEsther.TheBook ofEsther,oneof
the books in the Hebrew bible, describes a plot by Persia against the Jews. The Jews
attacked preemptively and foiled the plot. Or it could be for “My RTUs,” referring to the
RemoteTerminalUnitscontrolledbythePLCs.
Other clues are numeric. The number “19790509” appears in the Stuxnet code. It could be
a reference to the day in 1979 when a prominent Jewish Iranian businessman was
executed. Another date that appears is September 24, 2007. This is the date that the
Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, spoke at Columbia University and questioned
thevalidityoftheholocaust.
Are these clues? Were they inserted by the hackers as their signature? Or were they
insertedintentionallytoimplicateIsrael?Nooneknows.
In any event, many security experts believe that Israel may have developed Stuxnet, with
or withoutthehelpof theUnited States,as an alternative to aphysical attack onIran inthe
hopeofavoidingtheconsequencesofworldopiniontoanovertmilitaryattack.
What’s To Come?
Now that it has been released on the Internet for other hackers to study, Stuxnet has
opened a dangerous path for others to follow. It has shown that a targeted malware worm
can take control of an industrial control system. The bar has been lowered for destructive
attacksonmanyofthebasicinfrastructuresuponwhichwedepend.

Computer malware has until now primarily affected PCs or the servers to which they are
connected. Thesekeep businesses running. Malware maydo all kinds of software damage
toasystem,butitdoesnotthreatenlife,limb,orproperty.
Stuxnet is different. It is the first malware that can infect control systems and physically
destroy or disable our infrastructure. Safety systems could be switched off at a nuclear
power plant; fresh water could be contaminated with sewage, the valves in an oil pipeline
could be opened, causing immense contamination; railroad switches could be thrown to
causecollisions;electricalsubstationsandevenanentirepowergridcouldbetakendown.
Alan Bentley, senior international vice president at security firm Lumension, said that
Stuxnet is "the most refined piece of malware ever discovered” and that the worm was
significant because "mischief or financial reward wasn't its purpose. It was aimed right at
theheartofacriticalinfrastructure.”
