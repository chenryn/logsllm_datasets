FromtheAvailabilityDigest:"CenturyLinkTargetsSixNines"
The U.S. telco giant CenturyLink is aiming to offer its customers six nines of reliability in its SLAs
(Service Level Agreements). This is an extraordinary level of reliability. It means that, on the
average, its service will be down for onlythirtyseconds per year. Of course,this doesn’t implythat it
may be down thirty seconds every year. It may be down five minutes every ten years. Nevertheless,

WhyIsTheFCC AboutToRequireBatteriesForSurfingTheWeb?
A recent wave of meetings at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission indicates the agencyis
planning to force broadband providers to redesign cable and DSL modems to have bigger backup
batteries so you can (in theory) surf the web for up to 8 hours during a power outage. The FCC’s
plan to “place the responsibility” on broadband providers to provide backup power for your
broadband devices might sound good in the abstract. But responsibility and consumer choice are
twosidesofthesamecoin,andconsumerswillultimatelyenduppayingtheprice.

backup breakers received the test signal and opened, cutting power being delivered to the
