Orca - The Outage That May Change History
November2012
The Romney campaign looked forward with confidence to the November 6, 2012, U.S. presidential
election. Not only were many polls improving in its favor, but it had a secret weapon that it did not
discloseuntiljustbeforeElectionDay.Orca!
Orca was a massive, technologicallysophisticated tool that was aimed at GOTV – Get Out The Vote – in
the critical swing states that would decide the election outcome. In elections that are as close as this one
was predicted to be, outperforming polls by a single point can mean that entire states and all their
Electoralvotescanbewon.
But Orca failed. It never got off the ground on Election Day. Was this outage the cause of Governor
Romney’s loss to President Obama? We will never know the answer to this question, but it was quite
likelyafactor.
Orca
Orca was a Web-based application that allowed 37,000 Romney campaign workers spread among the
precincts of several key swing states to monitor and report who was voting. This data was sent in real
time to a campaign War Room at Republican headquarters in the Boston Garden (now the TD Garden),
whereitwascomparedtoknownRomneysupporters inthoseprecincts.Thedatawasusedbycampaign
headquarters to deploy calls and volunteers to known Romney supporters who hadn’t yet voted without
wastingresourcesonthosewhohad.
To use Orca, a volunteer logged into the Orca web site on his or her smart phone. The name and age of
every voter in the volunteer’s precinct was downloaded to the smart phone. As the volunteer was told by
precinct workers that a particular person had voted, that person’s name was checked off on the smart-
phone list; and this information was sent immediately to the War Room to support the efficient
deploymentofvolunteerstogetouttheRomneyvote.
Abackupcallresponsesystem was providedas ameans for volunteers togetdataintothesystem inthe
eventthattheirsmart-phoneconnectivityfailed.
Thus, Orca allowed the campaign to streamline from its campaign headquarters the efforts to maximize
turnoutofRomneybackers.
Orca was created and managed by a small group within the Romney campaign. It reportedly comprised

Romney Deputy Political Director Dan Centinello said in a training call for Project Orca volunteers,
“There’s nothing that President Obama himself can do to even come close to what we are putting
togetherhere.”
The Election Day Fiasco
Orca was effectively dead as soon as the polls opened. The first hint of a problem was that the system
almost immediately became overloaded with the traffic required to download voter lists simultaneously to
thousandsofvolunteers.Thisslowedthesystemtoacrawl.
Then, when voter data began to flow into Orca, the message rate was so high that Orca’s ISP decided
that this was a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack and began to reject the messages. When
message flow was resumed, the system’s response time was so slow that many volunteers decided that
the system was not working. When they tried to phone in results, the backup response system was so
backed up that all they heard was a recorded message to try again later. Cries for support to the

There were several operational problems as well. Many volunteers were given invalid PINs for logging

In addition, volunteers were told that this was a mobile app, but it couldn’t be found in the iTunes or
Android stores. This prevented volunteers from using the app in the first place. The problem was that
Orca was not a mobile app. It was a web site that could be directly accessed by the smart phone’s
browser.
The result was that the Romney central command had no clear view of what was happening in the
precincts, and it was unable to organize a GOTV campaign. Workers on the ground did not know which
doors to knock on. There is no estimate of the number of additional votes in the swing states the

What Went Wrong?
Howcouldasystemthatappearstobefunctionallystraightforwardturnoutsobadly?
Orca was developed over seven months, a fairly short time to get such a system into production. Its
development costs were several hundred thousand dollars, a small portion of the $40 million that the
Romneycampaignspent ontechnology.It was not developed bya professionalconsultingfirm butrather
byaninternal“skunkworks”ofcampaignstaffersandvolunteers.
The developers clearly had little appreciation for the importance of testing. Though it underwent some
beta testing, Orca was never tested in the complete environment of the Boston War Room. It was stress-
tested with automated testing tools but clearly not to the level to which it would ultimately be exposed in
therealworld.
Thedevelopersalsoseemednottohaveagraspoftheimportanceofpropertraining.UptoElectionDay,
the training programs comprised large dial-in sessions of hundreds of volunteers. These sessions
discouraged volunteers from asking questions. Furthermore, experts had warned that Orca’s training
manualscouldpotentiallyconfuseusers.
If the system had been given a dry run with the volunteers or better yet tested in a real election
environment such as during primary voting, these problems potentially would have been exposed. In
addition, other serious problems would have been identified. The fact that users were given wrong PINs
andthefactthatthePIN resettool didn’t work wouldhave beenidentified.Users wouldhave learnedthat

What Did the Democrats Do?
The Democrats faredmuch better. Theyhad experienced similar problems in the 2008 campaign. During
that campaign, they had developed “Project Houdini” to do a similar function. Unfortunately, Project
Houdini ran into challenges similar to what happened to Orca. However, the Democratic campaign had
prepared a backup plan using telephone communications; and this plan was effective and let them
achievetheirGOTVgoals.
In the 2012 campaign, the Democratic campaign implemented a new Orca-equivalent system that they
dubbed “Narwhal.” Narwhal went through two complete dry runs and worked perfectly during Election
Day.
As an aside, a Narwhal is a toothed whale that lives year-round in the Arctic. The Orca is the natural
predatoroftheNarwhal.
Lessons Learned
President Obamawon the electoral vote by332 of the 538total votes available(61.7% - almostatwo-to-
one margin). He won the popular vote by almost 3%. Could a properly functioning Orca have changed
this outcome? We will never know, but it certainly would have closed the gap. Most of the swing states
that gave President Obama his decisive electoral-vote margin were won by the Democrats by narrow
margins.
ItseemsthatthereweretwomainproblemswithOrca:
 The higher than expected traffic caused it to initially crash and then to be unresponsive for the
restofElectionDay.
 Volunteers could not access the system because of PIN difficulties, because they did not have
the proper certification to monitor the voting activities, or because they could not use their smart
phonesincertainpollingplaces.
Other aggravating factors werethat there was no viable fallback plan andthat training was inadequate. A
major problem was that volunteers were not given access to Orca until Election Day. Otherwise, they
wouldhavebeen abletobrowsethroughthesystem tobecomefamiliar withit;theywouldhaveidentified
thePINproblem;andtheywouldhavefoundthatOrcawasawebapplication,notamobileapp.
One insightful question that has been asked after the fact is why Orca was implemented on a national
basis with all control centered in the Boston campaign headquarters? Implementation at a state level
wouldhavebeenmuchmoremanageable.Trafficvolumeswouldhavebeenmuchless,andaproblem in
onecentermightnothavebeenaprobleminanothercenter.
If Abraham Lincoln had lost his election, we might not have a multiracial President today. If Franklin
Roosevelt had lost his election, we might not have Social Security today. If General Dwight Eisenhower
had lost his election, we might not have our Interstate Highway System today. What would be different
one hundred years from now if Governor Romney had not lost this election? We will never know, but
certainly history would have taken a different path. And Orca would perhaps have played a role, a role
thatwasdenieditbyincompetency.
