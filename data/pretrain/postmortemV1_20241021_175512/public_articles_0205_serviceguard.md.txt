HP’s ServiceGuard Clustering Facility
May2007
Clusters represent a predominant technology today to achieve high availability. A cluster is a set
of independent processing nodes with access to a common database. It provides a single-server
image to the users of the cluster. A cluster is managed by a cluster management facility such as
HP’sServiceGuard.
What is ServiceGuard?
HP’s ServiceGuard is a cluster management facility enjoying over 150,000 licenses worldwide. It
allows a company to customize and control its high availability clusters. With ServiceGuard, the

What is a Cluster?
A cluster is a configuration of two or more servers, or
nodes, in a high-availability configuration. This means
that each server in the cluster is backed up by some node1 data node2
other server in the cluster. Should one server fail, its base
functionsaretakenoverbyitsbackupserver.
Typically, only one server at a time can access a
particulardatabase.Thisistoavoiddatacorruptiondue virtualIP clustered
to two servers trying to write to the same data item at address server
the same time. (An exception is Oracle’s Real
Application Clusters database, which coordinates
activityamongseveralnodesinacluster).
There are three cluster configurations supported by
ServiceGuard:

 Active/Active1- Each server in the cluster is activelyrunning differentapplications as well
as acting as a backup for other servers. Should a server fail, its backup will continue
processing its own applications while also assuming the processing of the applications
thathadbeenrunningonthefailedprocessor.
 Parallel Database – Multiple servers are running the same application against the same
database. This can only be done with Oracle’s RAC and is a special ServiceGuard
extension(HPServiceGuardExtensionforRAC,orSGeRAC).Shouldoneserverfail,the

ServiceGuard’s Cluster Services

Packages
In a cluster, the failover unit is not a server. Rather, it is an application. Some large servers in
clusters can be running several applications simultaneously. Should there be a failure, the failure
may be in the application, not in the server. It may be necessary to fail over only that application
toabackupserver.
An application comprises the application code, the database it uses, and one or more IP
addresses that are used by users to access the application. These are combined together by
ServiceGuardintoapackage.3Itisthepackagethatistheunitoffailover,nottheserver.
Heartbeats
Heartbeat messages are periodicallyexchanged between the nodes in the cluster to inform each
other of their health. One node, the cluster coordinator, sends and receives these heartbeat
messages to all other nodes in the cluster. Should it not receive a response to a heartbeat from
somenode withina specifiedtimeperiod, it will declarethatnode to be down.Likewise, if anode
does not receive a heartbeat from the cluster coordinator, that node will declare that the cluster
coordinatornodeisdown.
Heartbeats are the very center of cluster management. It is extremely important that the
heartbeat mechanism be highly reliable. Therefore, it is common to provide a redundant private
connectionforheartbeatmessages.
TransferofControl(TOC)
If a node cannot communicate with a majority of the other nodes in its cluster, it causes itself to
fail.ThisTransferofControl(TOC)isinitiatedbytheServiceGuardclustersoftwaretoensurethat

The backup node can be specified to be either a specific node or to be the node with the fewest
packagesrunningonit.
TheTOC procedure stops the application on its current node, starts the application on its backup
node, directs the application to open its database on the new node, and remaps the application’s
IPaddressestothenewnode.
ClusterQuorum
The ServiceGuard software is monitoring the health of all of the nodes in the cluster. In the event
ofanodefailure,theclusterre-formsitselfwithoutthefailednode.
Should there be a communication failure between two sets of two or more nodes, ServiceGuard
re-forms the cluster around the larger set and causes the nodes in the smaller set to fail via a
TOC.Thelargersetofsurvivingnodesiscalledtheclusterquorum.
Shouldthetwosetsofseparatednodesbeofthesamesize,theywillbothattempttobecomethe
new cluster quorum. However, it is important that only one succeed in order to prevent data
corruption.ThiscanbeimplementedeitherthroughaclusterlockorviaaQuorumServer.
ClusterLock
ServiceGuard can provide a cluster lock which must be held by the current cluster quorum.
Should the cluster be separated into two sets of the same size, both sets will attempt to become
the new quorum by attempting to seize the cluster lock. The successful set will become the new
clusterquorum.ThelosingsetwillcauseitsnodestofailviaaTOC.
QuorumServer
AQuorumServerisanalternativetoaclusterlock.Itissoftwarerunningonanindependenthigh-

a node or a communication failure, the Quorum Server determines the nodes that will create the
new cluster quorum. Thus, if there is a splitting of the cluster into two sets of an equal number of
nodes,theQuorumServerwilldeterminewhichsetwillbecomethenewclusterquorum.
HardwareMonitoringandFailover
ServiceGuard monitors the processor, disks, and networks of the cluster. If it should determine
that a server can no longer function properly, it will fail over all of the packages currently running
onthatservertobackupservers.
ApplicationMonitoringandRecovery
Under normalconditions, ServiceGuardmonitors the healthof all of the cluster components.This
includestheapplicationsrunninginthecluster.
An application is started by ServiceGuard with a special cluster command that continually
monitorsthehealthofthatapplication.ShouldServiceGuardeverreceiveanindicationofanerror
exitfrom anapplication, it willinitiaterecoveryaction. ServiceGuard canbedirectedto attemptto
restart the application, to halt it, or to fail over the package to the package’s backup server via a
TOC.

LANMonitoringandRecovery
In addition to nodes and applications, ServiceGuard also monitors the cluster’s LANs. It can
quickly detect a LAN problem and will activate a spare LAN in the same cluster. This failover is
transparenttoboththeusersandthedatabases.
WorkloadBalancing
Following a failover, ServiceGuard can be instructed to move the packages from the failed node

Failover/FailbackPolicy
The system administrator can establish failover and failback policies. As mentioned earlier, a
failover policy might be to specify that a package fails over to a specific node or to the node
currentlyrunningtheleastnumberofpackages.
Each package can be specified to fail back to its original node once that node is returned to
service. Alternatively, it can be specified that the package remain on its backup node until the
systemadministratormovesit.

ServiceGuard Manager
The ServiceGuard Manager is a separate HP product that provides a graphical view of all of the
cluster components. It displays a cluster map showing all of the cluster components, their
properties, and their status. It is invaluable to quickly determine the location of a problem and to
tracktheactionsofServiceGuard.
Summary
ServiceGuard provides all of the services needed to efficiently manage an HP-UX or Linux
cluster. With over 150,000 installations around the world, ServiceGuard is clearly an important
contribution to the quest to achieve high availabilities. It is a very important element of HP’s
stated goal to achieve 5 9s:5 minutes of reliability (an availability of five 9s implies an average
downtimeoffiveminutesperyear).
