Court Decides - HP 1, Oracle 0
August2012
Oracle, after thirty years of close cooperation with HP, issued on March 12, 2011, a press release in
which it declared that it would no longer support its products on Itanium processors. The Itanium
processors form the basis of HP’s new blade systems upon which its predominant operating system, HP-

Hewlett-Packard Company, plaintiff, vs. Oracle Corporation, defendant, Proposed Statement of Decision,
Case No. 1-11-CV-203163; August 1, 2012.1 (Note: the decision is clear, entertaining, and easily

The trial of the HP/Oracle case began on May 31, 2012, proceeded through June 26, 2012, and took
twelvetrialdays.Thirtywitnessestestified,andover500exhibitswereintroducedintoevidence.
The case caused the Court to revisit the centuries-old issue of whether a contract exists and, if so, what
does it mean. When a dispute arises over the meaning of contract language, the first question to be
decidedis whether thelanguageis“reasonablysusceptible”totheinterpretationurgedbytheplaintiff.Ifit
is not, the case is over. Otherwise, the Court moves to the second question: what did the parties intend
thelanguagetomean?
Findings of Fact
TheLong-TermHP/OracleRelationship
For approximately three decades, Oracle ported its database, middleware, and key application software
toHP’s server platforms.Throughout this period, HP andOracle engaged injoint sales activities, withHP
selling its hardware and Oracle selling its software to mutual customers. The relationship was profitable
forbothcompanies.
In January, 2010, Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems. Sun sold Sparc systems that competed directly
withHP’sItaniumservers.HPwasconcernedwhetherOraclewouldcontinuetoofferitssoftwareonHP’s

servers now that Oracle would be competing with HP in the server market. Approximately80% to 90% of
HP’scustomersrantheOracledatabase.
In a meeting on February 26, 2010, David Donatelli, the executive in charge of HP’s enterprise server
business, was told by Thomas Kurian, Oracle’s most senior software executive second only to Larry
Ellison, that Oracle remained committed to the HP-Oracle partnership. New, fully functional versions of
OraclesoftwarewouldcontinuetobereleasedforHP-UX/Itaniumplatformsatsubstantiallythesametime

Furthermore, in a meeting on April 16, 2010, Oracle’s president, Safra Catz, and other senior Oracle
executives met with Ann Livermore, HP Executive Vice President, Donatelli, and other senior HP
executives. The Oracle executives reiterated that Oracle remained committed to the HP alliance and to
ensuringthatOraclesoftwarewasoptimizedonHPservers.
However, in May, 2010, HP discovered that Oracle’s sales force was suggesting that Oracle’s
commitment to HP-UX was no longer available. Confronted with this information, Catz assured HP that

GoodBye,MarkHurd
Things took a turn for the worse on August 26, 2010, when Mark Hurd, CEO of HP, was forced to resign
by the HP Board of Directors. On September 6, 2010, Oracle announced that Hurd would be joining
Oracle as its Co-President. The next day, HP initiated a lawsuit against Hurd in an effort to protect its
tradesecrets(theCourtagreedthatthis wasareasonableapproachforHPtotake).Thiselicitedasame-
dayflamingresponsefromLarryEllison:
“Oraclehas long viewedHPas an importantpartner. …Byfilingthis vindictivelawsuitagainstOracle
and Mark Hurd, the HP Board is acting with utter disregard for that partnership, our joint customers,
and their shareholders and employees. The HP Board is making it virtually impossible for Oracle and
HPtocontinuetoworktogetherintheITmarketplace.”
TheReaffirmationAgreement
Interestingly,onthesamedayas Ellison’s press release,topHPandOracleexecutives indicatedtoeach
other that they wanted to get this lawsuit behind them as quickly as possible so as to preserve the
relationship that each company valued. Negotiations proceeded rapidly, and on September 20, 2010, a
Settlement and Release Agreement was executed between HP, Oracle, and Hurd. Key to Judge
Kleinberg’sdecisiononAugust1,2012,wasthefirstparagraphofthisagreement:
Reaffirmation of the Oracle-HP Partnership: Oracle and HP reaffirm their commitment to their
longstanding strategic relationship and their mutual desire to continue to support their mutual
customers. Oracle will [emphasis added] continue to offer its product suite on HP platforms, and HP
will continue to support Oracle products (including Oracle Enterprise Linux and Oracle VM) on its
hardware in a manner consistent with that partnership as it existed prior to Oracle’s hiring of Mark
Hurd.”
The term “will” in the opening paragraph is highlighted as it became the key to the judge’s decision. The
agreement required both companies to keep the agreement confidential. It was not released to even key
employeesofeithercompany,includingsuchexecutivesasMartinFink.
A press release following the execution of the agreement stated that the parties reaffirmed “HP and
Oracle’s commitment to delivering the best products and solutions to our more than 140,000 customers.”

ThePost-AgreementPeriod
Following the execution of the agreement, the parties continued to engage in product development and
porting. Then six months later, on March 22, 2011, Oracle dropped its bomb.Without any warning to HP,
it announced the night before HP’s annual shareholders’ meeting that it had decided to discontinue all
software development for HP’s Itanium servers. Oracle conceded in court that its announcement meant
that customers who ran the Oracle software on Itanium would now have to choose another hardware
platform.
HP immediately launched a lawsuit to require Oracle to continue its support of Itanium for all of Oracle’s
currentandfutureproducts.
The Arguments
HP’sargumentwasquitesimple–theagreementstatedthat“Oraclewillcontinuetoofferitsproductsuite
on HP platforms.” The term “will” implied a contractual obligation, and Oracle could not on a whim refuse
toportfutureproductversionstoItanium.
Oraclepresentedtwoargumentstosupportitsposition:
 The Reaffirmation paragraph was nothing more than a “public hug” between HP and Oracle and
imposednoobligationsoneitherparty.
 Oracle claimed that the phrase “in a manner consistent with the HP-Oracle partnership” was only
anagreementtoanapproachandleftOraclewithabsolutediscretionwithregardtoporting.
The Decision
ThejudgefoundthefollowingwithrespecttoOracle’stwoarguments:
 Oracle’s “public hug” interpretation disregards the mandate in the second sentence of the
agreement. The mandate states that “Oracle will continue to offer its product suite on HP
platforms.” The term “will” implies a contractual obligation. Oracle did not offer an alternative
meaningforthesentencebutinsteadassertedthatithadnomeaning.
 The phrase “in a manner consistent with the HP-Oracle partnership” does not suggest that the
mandatory phrase Oracle “will continue” actually means that Oracle “may continue” or has the
“discretion to continue” offering its products. Such an interpretation flatly contradicts the plain
languageofthecontract.
In conclusion, the judge found that the only reasonable interpretation was HP’s, which is founded on the
plain language of the Reaffirmation paragraph. The Reaffirmation paragraph is unambiguous. The
contractiscertainandenforceable.
Promissory Estoppel
Another cause of action in HP’s lawsuit is that Oracle violated verbal contracts (promissory estoppel). In
many meetings between HP and Oracle executives, right up to the March 22, 2011, announcement that
Oracle would stop support for Itanium,2 Oracle executives continued to promise support for Itanium.
Relying on these assertions, HP made major investments in Itanium, such as its Itanium Collaboration
Agreement(ICA)withIntel,wherebyitcommittedtoinvest$264millioninItanium.
2 Oracle’s statement that it would no longer support Itanium meant that it would no longer port new versions of its products to
Itanium.Itwould,however,continuetosupportcustomerswithexistingversions.

The Order
In his Summary of Decision, Judge Kleinberg concluded that “the core argument of Oracle is that this
dispute,likeaSeinfeldsitcom,isaboutnothing.”Heissuedthefollowingorders:
1. In this action for declaratory relief, the Court finds in favor of HP and against Oracle on both the
breachofcontractandpromissoryestoppelcausesofactionbroughtbyHP.
2. The Settlement and Release Agreement entered into byHP, Oracle, and Hurd on September 20,
2010, requires Oracle to continue to offer its product suite on HP’s Itanium-based server
platformsanddoesnotconferonOraclethediscretiontodecidewhethertodosoornot.
3. The term ‘product suite’ means Oracle software products that were offered on HP’s Itanium-
based servers at the time Oracle signed the September 20, 2010, Settlement and Release
Agreement,includinganynewreleases,versionsorupdatesofthoseproducts.

Summary
In an email to its AllianceONE Partner Program, HP said “This is a very positive result for you and HP.
We remain committed to our partners, our 140,000 customers who run Oracle software and to our long-
term mission-critical server roadmap, including Integrity, HP-UX, OpenVMS, and NonStop as well as our
new investments in x86, Windows, and Linux. Similarly, Intel has repeatedly reinforced its ongoing
commitmenttotheItaniumroadmap.”
