Data communication has come a long way since AT&T (American Telephone and
Telegraph) first introduced it in the late 1950s. I was recently taken on a nostalgic trip
back to those early days while touring the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. You
see, at Bell Telephone Laboratories, I supervised the development group that designed one of the very
firstmodems (modulator/demodulator) for the transmission of data over telephone lines – the DataPhone
103. I was amazed to see a DataPhone 103 in a display case in the Museum, and the memories
returned.
Could Data Be Sent Over Telephone Lines?
When I first joined Bell Labs in 1958, shortlyafter receiving myMaster’s Degree in Electrical Engineering
from MIT, the Labs was just finishing up a year-long trial to determine if, in fact, it was possible to send
data over the telephone network. They had sent a van to travel the country with equipment designed to
send data back to the Labs’ facilities in Murray Hill, New Jersey, over the telephone network. The result
was sadly negative – data could not be reliably transmitted over the telephone network as it currently
existed.Theproblem?Echosuppressors.
Each telephone line segment has a certain “impedance” that is a function of its length and the type of
cable used. A line segment’s impedance is a measure of the opposition that the line segment gives to a
signal flowing through it. The longer the line, the greater its impedance. When two lines join, the
impedancemismatchbetweenthetwolines causes a smallamountof thesignal travelingover the lineto
be reflected back to the speaking person. The result is an echo that is audible and disconcerting to the
person speaking. (Have you ever tried to speak into an echo chamber? You rapidly lose the capability to
speakclearly.)
To correct the echo problem, most long-distance trunk circuits were fitted with echo suppressors. These

talk at the same time – only one would get through. I can remember trying to interrupt my other party by
speakingswiftly,hopingtogetawordinedgewisesoIcouldgettheline.
The problem this posed for data communication was that full-duplex communication, in which data was
traveling in bothdirections simultaneously, would not bepossible. Evenfor half-duplex communication, in
which only one side transmitted at a time, a station that had been receiving could not begin transmitting
until it had sent a tone for a period of time to reverse the echo suppressors in the connection. This was

AT&T desperately wanted to introduce data communication, so at this point two decisions were made.
One was to fix the telephone network. The other was to begin the development of data communication
equipmentthatbusinessescouldleasetosenddata.
Fixing the Telephone Network
The fix to the telephone network was conceptually simple but massive in scope. A standard impedance
for the trunk circuits was specified, and specialized devices were added to each end of each trunk circuit
tomakeitsimpedancematchthestandard.

DataPhone Development
Simultaneous with the telephone network upgrade, the development of data communication equipment
began. There were several groups working on the development of this equipment, as there were various
models with different capabilities that had been specified. All of these different devices were called
“DataPhones”byAT&T.
DataPhone101
TheDataPhone101wasalreadyinservice,havingbeenintroducedin1958.Itprovidedacommunication
rate of 110 bits/second meant to service the new Model 33 and Model 35 ASCII teletypewriters. Since
thesetypewriterswereonlyhalfduplex(i.e.,theycouldnotsendandreceiveatthesametime),andsince
thespeedsweresolow,echosuppressorswerenotaproblem.
BitsvsBaud
I just said that the DataPhone 101 had a speed of 110 bits per second. This is not really true. “Bits” is a
measure of information. A teletype character is actually 11 bits in length – a start bit, eight data bits (in
ASCII), and two stop bits. Thus, the DataPhone 101 could transmit ten characters per second. Each
character included eight bits of data. So the information rate of the DataPhone 101 was actually 80 bits
persecond.
The DataPhone 101 accomplished this by sending a sequence of 110 “ones” and “zeros” per second.
This speed is properly referred to as the “baud” rate. Thus, the correct statement is that the DataPhone
101 transmitted at a speed of 110 baud. I will use the term “baud” in what follows to characterize the
speedsofthevariousDataPhones.
DataPhone103
There was no DataPhone 102. The next in line was the DataPhone
103, which was my baby. The DataPhone 103 was designed to
provide full-duplex communication at a rate of 300 baud in each
direction via frequency-shift keying. The originating station sent a
signal shifting between 1270 hertz for a mark (a “one”) and 1070
hertz for a space (a “zero”). The answering station shifted between
2225 hertz for a mark and 2025 hertz for a space. At 300 baud, it
would have taken seven hours to transmit a standard, one

DataPhone202
The other DataPhones that were developed at the same time were the DataPhone 201 and the
DataPhone 202. The DataPhone 202 was a higher speed, half-duplex version of the DataPhone 103. It
communicated at 1200 baud using frequency-shift signaling, transmitting a mark at 1200 hertz and a
spaceat2200hertz.
DataPhone201
The DataPhone 201 was a half-duplex DataPhone operating at the “blazing” speed of 2,400 bits per
second (not baud). It used four separate frequency bands, each simultaneously sending two bits of an
eight-bit character using phase-shift keying. Each channel transmitted its corresponding bits at a rate of
300 bits per second. Since there were no start/stop bits, this speed of 8 x 300 = 2,400 bits per seconds
wastrulytheinformationrate.
AsTimeWentBy
As the years passed, DataPhone speeds over the telephone network increased to 4,800 baud, then to
9,600 baud, and finally to 19,200 baud by using ever more sophisticated techniques. Next came 3G, 4G

The AT&T Stranglehold
From the onset, AT&T refused to let any other manufacturer develop its own data-communication
equipment and attach it to the AT&T network. At that time, AT&T had a monopoly on the communication
network – there were no Verizons or Sprints. AT&T’s argument was that equipment that was not properly
designedcoulddamageitsnetwork.
Several companies that were in the data-communications business sued AT&T to gain access to its
telephone network for data communications using their devices. In a landmark case, Judge Learned
HandforcedAT&Ttoopenitsnetworktootherdata-communicationproviders.
In 1982, the U.S.’s Reagan Administration used the Sherman Act to break AT&T into one long-distance
company and seven regional “Baby Bells,” arguing that competition should replace monopoly for the
benefitofconsumersandtheeconomyasawhole.BellLabs wasspunofffromAT&T andbecamejointly
owned by the Baby Bells as their development arm. However, competition between the Baby Bells led

Summary
It took only about four decades for data-communication speeds to progress from a thousand bits per
second to multimillion bits per second. Today’s Internet would not be very useful at DataPhone speeds,

In fact, the DataPhone 103 technology lives on. DataPhone 103 modulation is still in use today in
shortwave radio, amateur radio, and some commercial applications. Its low signaling speed and use of
