Pathway – HPE NonStop’s Application Environment
May2016
At a recent fault-tolerant symposium, I presented an overview of HPE NonStop systems.
I stressed the immense scalability of these systems as well as their abilityto survive any
singlefault(andinsomecases,multiplefaults).
I was struck by the interest shown by the audience in the NonStop process monitor, NonStop Pathway. I
came to realize that Pathway is the foundation for application fault tolerance, scalability, and load
balancing in NonStop systems. Pathway removes the concerns of these important attributes from the
applicationprogrammerandimplementsthem‘under-the-covers.’
In this article, we review the architecture of NonStop systems and explain how Pathway provides
applications withfaulttolerance,scalability,andloadbalancingwithnoeffortonthepartoftheapplication
programmer.
The NonStop Architecture
HPE NonStop systems began their life in 1974 as Tandem NonStop systems marketed by Tandem
Computers, Inc. Tandem Computers, Inc. was acquired by Compaq in 1997. Compaq was acquired by
HP in 2001. In 2015, HP split into two companies, HP and HP Enterprise (HPE). HP retained the PC and
printer business, and HPE inherited the systems business. The fault-tolerant systems described herein
arenowknownasHPENonStopsystems.
Right from the beginning, NonStop systems have featured a ‘massive parallel processing’ (MPP)
architecture. In this unique shared-nothing architecture, each processor comes with its own copy of the
operating system. There is no shared memory. The system relies heavily on interprocess communication
betweenpeerprocesses.
In contrast to conventional high-availability clusters, the NonStop system provides full hardware/software
faulttolerancewithimmenselinearscalability.EachNonStopsystem canbeconfiguredwithuptosixteen
processors interconnected by a duplex high-speed bus. The original bus was called Dynabus. This was
later replaced with a duplexed fabric called ServerNet.With the introduction of the NonStop X, ServerNet
hasbeensupersededbytheindustry-standardInfiniband.
With a high-speed network fabric clustering the system, the limitation of sixteen processors became
irrelevant. Much larger configurations with hundreds of processors operating in parallel can now be run
very efficiently. Interestingly, after more than four decades of service, the NonStop architecture
essentiallyhasremainedthesame.
The current processors of NonStop systems using ServerNet are implemented with the Intel Itanium
microprocessor. These systems are designated NonStop i systems (Figure 1). NonStop i systems are
nowbeingsupersededbyNonStopX systems (Figure2) basedonthe industry-standardx86 architecture

Both product lines leverage multicore operation of the underlying processor chip. The use of Infiniband
(which is significantly faster than ServerNet) also opens the opportunity for NonStop X systems to
connect directly to other systems such as Linux front ends without having to go through an internal
controller (a CLIM). In addition to the greater speed of the x86 microprocessors as compared to the
Itanium chips in the NonStop i systems, Infiniband allows NonStop X systems to provide significant
additionalprocessingcapacitycomparedtotheNonStopisystems.

Architecture Fundamentals
Fault-Tolerance
In NonStop systems, fault tolerance is achieved via checkpointed process pairs. Each critical process is
configured withabackupprocess runninginanother processor.Whenever thestateof theactiveprocess
changes, it sends a checkpoint message to its backup synchronizing the backup process state to that of
the active process. Thus, if the active process fails (typically due to a processor failure), the backup
processimmediatelytakesoverwithnointerruptioninprocessing.
Figure3:CheckpointedProcessPair
Initially, application programmers were expected to write their own checkpointed process pairs for critical
processes. However, this often proved to be too complex for ordinary application programmers.
Therefore, the achievement of fault tolerance for application programs was moved to a new system
software facility called ‘Pathway,” as described later. As we shall see, applications written in a Pathway
environment can be provided with fault tolerance with little effort on the part of the application
programmer. Failover following a fault takes a little longer (seconds) but is fast enough to have little
impact on the users of an application. Critical system processes (such as Pathway itself, the NonStop
Transaction Monitor TMF, and disk processes) are all implemented as checkpointed process pairs within
theNonStopsystemsoftware.
Expandability
Communication between processes in the processors is via interprocess messages sent over the
backbone fabric. Access to external devices is via CLIMs (CLuster I/O Modules) also connected to the
ServerNet or Infiniband fabric. There is no common memory used for interprocess communication.
Therefore,thereis nofundamentallimittotheexpandabilityofasystem,whichisanear-linearfunctionof
the number of processors in the system. In fact, up to 255 systems (4,080 processors) can be linked in a
cluster, and each additional processor added to the cluster increases the system capacity by 98% of that
processor’scapacity.
Pathway
The fault-tolerance and immense scalability of NonStop systems are powerful enhancements to bring to
an application. But how is an application programmer who is not an expert in NonStop fundamentals
expectedtotakeadvantageofthesefeatures?
The answer is Pathway. The Pathway application manager/provisioning facility provides the runtime
execution environment for Pathway applications. As such, it automatically provides fault tolerance,
scalability, and load balancing for applications running within its environment. A high-level overview of a

ServerClasses
Pathwaycomprises acollection of server classes.Aserver class contains one or moreidentical stateless
servers designed to process a particular transaction. Typically, a server in a server class will receive a
transaction and will route the database updates to the appropriate databases. The NonStop Transaction
Management Facility (TMF) is responsible for maintaining the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency,
Independence, and Durability) of the transaction as it updates the database. NonStop systems support
three databases – Enscribe, a relational file system, SQL/MP, a SQL database, and SQL/MX, a newer
SQLdatabasethatcompliesmorecloselywiththeANSISQLstandard.
It is the server classes that provide the power of the Pathway environment. The servers in a server class
can be spread among several processors in a NonStop system. If a server class becomes overloaded,
Pathway can spawn additional servers for the server class. If the load on a server class falls to the point
whereallofitsserversarenotneeded,itcanterminatesomeofitsservers.
Scalability
It is the Pathway server classes that provide the application scalability provided by Pathway. If the load
imposed by a transaction starts to overload a server class, Pathwaysimplyspawns more servers for that
server class. The servers can be assigned to processors that are carrying less load. Thus, as an
application needs more processing power, Pathway automatically assigns more processing power to the
applicationbyexpandingtheserverclass.
If the load imposed by a transaction begins to recede, Pathway will terminate some of the servers in the
server class servicing that transaction. As already described above, the Pathway system ‘breathes’ by
swiftly acquiring more system resources during high load situations and by quickly releasing those
resourceswhentheyarenolongerneeded.
FaultTolerance
It is also the server classes that provide fault tolerance to an application. Should a processor in a
NonStop system fail, Pathway will route further transactions only to servers running in surviving

processors. In cooperation with TMF, those transactions affected by a failed processor are recovered
automaticallywithnodatalossorduplication.
LoadBalancing
Pathway balances the transaction processing load across processors by routing transactions to servers

PathwayDomains
Multiple identical Pathway environments can be configured as a Pathway domain that behaves as a
single, large Pathway application. Any of the Pathway environments within a domain can be taken down
for maintenance while the remaining environments within the domain continue processing work with no
interruption. This enables online rebalancing of Pathway environments without planned outages. It also

A remote Pathway environment can be configured as part of a domain. Thus, a logical Pathway server
class can span multiple NonStop systems.This allows a NonStop node in a domain to be taken down for
maintenance while the application remains available on other nodes. Pathway automatically routes
requests only to the available nodes in a domain. This also increases scalability because a Pathway
application can span multiple NonStop nodes, which can actually be part of a bigger ServerNet or

Summary
NonStop systems provide several significant advantages over other processing systems, including
immense scalability and fault tolerance. By using the Pathway runtime environment, application
programmers can make full use of these characteristics without specialized programming knowledge.
