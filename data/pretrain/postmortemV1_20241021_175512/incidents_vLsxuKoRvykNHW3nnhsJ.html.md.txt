## INCIDENT REPORT

**Summary:**

Google Cloud Networking experienced reduced capacity for lower priority
traffic such as batch, streaming and transfer operations from 19:30
US/Pacific on Thursday, 14 July 2022, through 15:02 US/Pacific on
Friday, 15 July 2022. High-priority user-facing traffic was not
affected. This service disruption resulted from an issue encountered
during a combination of repair work and a routine network software
upgrade rollout. Due to the nature of the disruption and resilience
capabilities of Google Cloud products, the impacted regions and
individual impact windows varied substantially. To our customers whose
businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize.
This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you,
and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform's
availability.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause was identified as an issue with a new control plane
configuration rollout, causing low-priority classified traffic capacity
reduction in Google's internal backbone network connecting data centers.
Mitigation efforts were slowed by the capacity reduction, and
engineering teams required more than their usual time to safely undo the
configuration change. During the period of the rollout and subsequent
rollback, constrained traffic in certain cloud zones affected the
performance of some Cloud services.

**Remediation and Prevention:**

At approximately 02:00 US/Pacific on Friday, 15 July, as an in-progress
rollout expanded to more regions, Google engineers observed performance
degradation in Cloud Networking due to reduced capacity. The engineering
team then started an investigation into the cause. At 03:50 US/Pacific,
Google engineers pushed the first mitigation attempt to halt the ongoing
rollout. While this effort succeeded in pausing any new actions, those
already in progress continued, which further reduced network capacity.

Subsequently, the engineering team shifted their mitigation efforts
toward a global rollback of the problematic configuration. Their first
attempt to mitigate using a configuration push was applied at 08:40
US/Pacific, but it was not successfully applied to all nodes, due in
part to the reduced network performance. Google engineers worked through
alternate mitigations, and by 12:40 US/Pacific, the configuration was
updated correctly, and this mitigated the majority of impact.

By 15:02 US/Pacific on 15 July 2022, services for all customers had been
restored. The Google Cloud Service Health Dashboard was updated to
reflect this.

Google is committed to preventing future recurrence, and we are taking
the following actions:

Detection:

-   Improve signals to detect significant changes in traffic for
    upgraded domains in the backbone network.
-   Improve dashboards that help debugging global- and domain-level
    control failures and configuration status.

Prevention:

-   Improve the automated handling of disconnected local Software
    Defined Networking (SDN) controllers that will reduce overall impact
    and mitigation time.
-   Improve the global safety systems that globally halt elective
    rollouts on Google's wide area (WAN) networks, when global capacity
    is reduced.
-   Further isolate production network neighborhoods.

Mitigation:

-   Improve the API to push changes to global and local network
    controllers during a service disruption.
-   Improve failure domain configuration validation to reject unintended
    configuration.
-   Improve the feature and testing of emergency tools across different
    scenarios at regular intervals, and invest in test environments that
    enable us to do this without impact.

**Detailed Description of Impact:**

**Google Cloud Networking**

-   Google Cloud Networking experienced reduced capacity within the
    Google Cloud regions of us-east1, southamerica-west1, us-central1,
    and us-central2, starting from Friday 15 July 2022 02:24 US/Pacific.
    The most severe impact occurred from 03:58 to 12:40.
-   southamerica-west1 experienced reduced capacity between 14:40 and
    15:02.
-   southamerica-west1 and southamerica-east1 both experienced egress
    packet loss between 20% and 30%.

**Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**

-   Between Thursday, 14 July 2022 21:57 US/Pacific and Friday, 15 July
    12:40 US/Pacific, GCS customers may have experienced elevated
    latency, delays, issues importing, exporting or querying data from
    GCS buckets, and HTTP 500 errors in the Google Cloud regions of
    us-east1, southamerica-west1, and us-central2, and for buckets
    located in us-central1, us-east1, and nam4.
-   This disruption affected 0.007% of GCS requests and impacted
    customers reading/writing data and metadata.

**Google BigQuery**

-   Customer workloads running in impacted Google Cloud regions and
    using the BigQuery Storage Read and Write APIs to read from or write
    to BigQuery may have experienced elevated latency.

**Note**

-   Additional services may have been impacted by this event but did not
    meet the thresholds to be included in this report.

This is a preliminary Incident Report (Mini-IR). A Full Incident Report
with additional details is being prepared and will be posted at a later
date.

We apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may
have caused. We would like to provide some information about this
incident below. Please note, this information is based on our best
knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our
investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what

(All Times US/Pacific)

**Incident Start:** 14 July 2022 19:30

**Incident End:** 15 July 2022 15:02

**Duration:** 19 hours, 32 minutes

**Affected Services**

Google Cloud Networking Google BigQuery Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

**Regions/Zones:** Global **Description:**

Google Cloud Networking experienced reduced availability globally for a
period of 19 hours and 32 minutes. Because of the nature of the outage
and resilience capabilities of GCP products, the impacted regions and
individual impacted windows may vary inside of the network impact
window. From preliminary analysis, the root cause was due to an issue
with a new control plane configuration rollout.

**Customer Impact:**

Google Cloud Storage

-   Affected customers would have experienced elevated latencies or HTTP
    500 errors in multiple regions, including us-east1, us-central1, and
    southamerica-west1.
-   Affected customers reading/writing data from GCS impacted regions or
    from buckets located in impacted regions would have observed high
    latency and/or errors.
-   Affected customers reading/writing metadata for buckets located in
    impacted regions would have observed high latency and/or errors.

Google BigQuery

-   Affected customers performing cross-regional table copies would have
    observed increased latency and/or errors.
