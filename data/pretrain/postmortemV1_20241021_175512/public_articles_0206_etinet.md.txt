Virtual Tape for NonStop Servers with ETI-NET’s EZX-BackBox
June2007
Magnetic tape has been used for decades to back up critical data in data centers. However,

The EZX-BackBox Virtual Tape System
EZX-BackBox is a part of the EZX product family from ETI-NET. The
EZX-BackBox virtual tape system provides a powerful virtual tape robot
solution for all HP NonStop servers and allows NonStop systems to use
existingcorporatestorageenvironments.
EZX-BackBox emulates one or more native tape devices attached to HP NonStop servers. It is
seen by the operating system as standard tape drives connected to SCSI or fiber channel ports.
The standard NSK tape process is used. Virtual volumes are managed using unmodified
Guardian media manager software such as DSM/TC or TMFCOM. Distinct volume pools are
reservedforvirtualvolumes.
Short-term backups are stored in disk pools, from which they can be rapidly restored when
required. Upon reaching the expiration of their designated retention periods, their backup data is
automaticallydeletedfrom thedisk pools;andthatspaceisfreedupforsubsequentuse.Thereis
no need for removable media. There is no risk of tape media failures. Storage administrator time
isfreedupformorecriticaltasks.

The EZX-BackBox Architecture
Virtual tape backup is performed by the EZX-
BackBox Virtual Tape Controller. The Controller
resides on a standard Windows server platform and
canattachtomultipleHVD SCSIortwo-gigabytefiber SCSIorFC
disk
channel (FC) tape ports on NonStop S-series or
tapeport
Integrity servers. Furthermore, the Controller can
attachtomultipleNonStopnodes.
EZX-BackBox
Controller
The Guardian tape I/O process is unaware that it is
NonStop
notdrivingatapemachine. Rather,theEZX-BackBox Server
Controller emulates anyone of the native tape devices used on NonStop servers. It accepts tape
write commands and writes the data to disk instead of tape. It can also accept tape read
commands and read data from disk, passing it to the tape process just as if it had come from
tape.
The disks that the Controller uses to store backup data can be locally resident on the Windows
server, or they can be external, such as storage area networks (SANs) or enterprise backup
servers.
The Controller integrates with DSM/TC (the Distributed System Management Tape Catalog) to
provideautomaticcatalogingofvirtualvolumes.VirtualvolumesaremanagedbyGuardianmedia
management software such as DSM/TC or TMFCOM. The Controller automatically mounts the

System setup and configuration is done via the EZX-BackBox user interface. This interface also
provides a range of manual operations. The user interface is browser-based. It can be accessed

EZX-BackBox supports optional encryption and compression in the EZX Controller. This applies
to all virtual media in a data store as well as to objects sent to an ESM. EZX-BackBox can also

Disaster Recovery
EZX-BackBox can replicate backup data to a remote site to provide a recovery database in the

severalprimarysites.
Deduplication
Data deduplication is an approach for drastically increasing disk storage capacities for backup
dataandfordrasticallydecreasingthebandwidthrequiredtoreplicatethisdatatoaremotesite.
Data deduplication relies on the fact that relatively little data on a host system typically changes
between the time of one backup to the next. Most backup utilities, such as NonStop
Backup/Restore, take this into account by providing incremental backups which record only that
datawhichhaschangedsincethelastbackup.
However, within individual files, only a few bytes may have changed; but these files will be
backed up in their entirety by an incremental backup. The same is true of database changes.
NonStopTMFincrementallybacksupentiretableseventhoughonlyafewbyteshavechanged.
Data deduplication methods monitor the content of backup data streams being generated by the
hosttapeprocessandstoreonlytheactualdataelementsthathavechanged(forinstance,onlya
record or a row). This can be done without any direct knowledge of the data structures involved
on the host system. Thus, data deduplication leads to a significant reduction in the backup data
stream.Thistranslatestosmallerdiskstoragerequirementsandreducedbandwidth.
ETI-NET has integrated a powerful data deduplication product into EZX-BackBox. This product is

require only a small fraction of their normal disk storage requirements. In fact, Data Domain
