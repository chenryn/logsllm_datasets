Aberdeen’s 2008 Business Continuity Survey
April2008
The Aberdeen Group, a major industry analysis firm, has published its most recent survey
concerning the state of business continuity planning and implementation among a broad
spectrum of small to large companies. This March, 2008, report, entitled Business
Continuity: Implementing Disaster Recovery Strategies and Technologies, is publicly
available at http://www.aberdeen.com/summary/report/benchmark/4662-RA-business-
continuity-disaster-recovery.asp.
Aberdeen notes that 62% of the companies surveyed experienced between one and five
business interruption events in the last year. 34% of all companies surveyed have yet to
implementasolution.Itseems thatthereremains adisconnectbetweenrealityandaction in
the marketplace when it comes to protecting a company’s IT assets from failures and
disasters.
The Survey Base
The survey focused on those enterprises that have implemented a business continuity/disaster
recovery(BC/DR) solution.Inall,150companies took partinthesurvey.Thecompanies covered

Ranking of Organizations
Aberdeen used three key performance metrics to distinguish the quality of an organization’s
BC/DRefforts:
1. TheabilitytomeetitsRecoveryTimeObjective(RTO).
2. Thetimethatittooktorecoverfromitsmostrecentbusinessdisruption.
3. Thedecreaseinunplanneddowntimethatithadachieved.1
Based on these metrics, Aberdeen ranked the responding organizations into three tiers – Best in
Class,IndustryAverage,andLaggard.Thetop20% of organizations madetheBest-in-Class tier.
Thebottom30%wereratedasLaggards.Themiddle50%formedtheIndustry-Averagetier.
The Performance of the Tiers

1. 50% of organizations met their RTO 100% of the time. On the average, this tier met its
RTO93%ofthetime.
2. 95% recovered from the most recent disruption in less than one hour. The average
recoverytimewasthirtyminutes.
3. 41% achieved more than a 10% decrease in unplanned downtime. The average
decreasewas8.7%.
IndustryAverage
1. 17% of organizations met their RTO 100% of the time. On the average, this tier met its

2. 19% recovered from the most recent disruption in less than one hour. The average
recoverytimewas2.1hours.
3. 26% achieved more than a 10% decrease in unplanned downtime. The average

Laggards
1. 0% of organizations met their RTO 100% of the time. On the average, this tier met its

2. 0% recovered from the most recent disruption in less than one hour. The average
recoverytimewas15.7hours.
3. 13% achieved more than a 10% decrease in unplanned downtime. The average
decreasewas0.5%.
Continuity Plan Strategies
The creation and maintenance of a BC/DR plan is the underpinning for a successful BC/DR
strategy. This plan must be continually updated, and it must be made readily available to those

that should be taken. Testing disaster recovery requires failing the primary system and failing
over to the backup system. Such testing often requires weeks of planning, the assembly at test
time of all critical personnel, and procedures to recover from a failed test. The system may be
down for hours as failover and failback are tested. If there is no window in which this testing can
bedone,thiscomplicatesthetestingprocess.

Another area in the competitive assessment is the ability to meet data availability SLAs. This
dependsstronglyuponthetechnologyusedtoback upcriticaldata.Aberdeenfoundthefollowing
usagestatisticsforbackuptechnologies:
BestinClass AllOthers
PhysicalTape 81% 58%
Replication 35% 30%
ManagedService 31% 13%
VirtualTape 19% 13%
The leading best-in-class companies are more aggressively pursuing new technologies such as
replication and virtual tape for the storage of their critical data. The advantage of these new
technologies is the significantly reduced time to recover data and the reduction in the amount of
unrecoverabledata,thussupportinganimprovedrecoverytimeobjective(RPO).
Pressures for BC/DR Planning and Implementation
It is clear from the above study that companies have a long way to go to provide the protection
that they need to recover from a disaster.Whyafter all these years of industry discussion on the

Evidently, these pressures are not being felt by many companies. It is interesting that only 5% of
therespondentsarereactingtopriorinterruptions.Perhapsthisisbecausenaturaldisasterssuch
as hurricanes or tornados tend to occur only in specific regions. In contrast, companies in
regulated industries such as financial institutions and government agencies are required to have
formalbusinesscontinuityplans.
Summary
Today’s organizations, by and large, have a long way to go to ensure the survival of IT services
following a disaster. The implementation, maintenance, and periodic testing of a BC/DR plan can
be verycostly;butthis cost has to be comparedtothe costof downtimefollowing adisaster.The
cost of downtime varies by industry but can range from thousands of dollars to millions of dollars
per hour. In some systems,lives maybe in danger. In anycase, a long enough outage can put a
companyoutofbusinessaswasprovenbythe9/11terroristdisaster.
Though not included in the survey, active/active systems provide the ultimate protection of IT
assets. Should a node fail or be destroyed, services can be restored within seconds with little if
any loss of data. Better still, if a passive backup system is already in place, the cost of moving to
active/active can be very little. Best of all is that there is no technical testing of the backup plan
required except for the ability to switch users or transactions to a surviving node – it is always
known that the backup node or nodes are operational. BC/DR testing can then focus on the
equallyimportantproblemsoftherelocationofpeopleandtheirsupportservices.
