Telstra Plagued With Series of Outages
June2016
Australia’s major communications company, Telstra, has had a bad string of months.
During the four month period from February 2016 to May 2016, Telstra has suffered
seven outages. Some of these have denied millions of customers access to voice and data services for
hours.

Telstra’s Troublesome Four Months – February through May, 2016
Telstra’s mobile network had five major communication outages in February and March. These were
followed by two more ADSL1 outages in May. To compensate its mobile customers, Telstra offered two
‘freedata’daystoitscustomers.
In an effort to improve its service, Telstra is investing AU$50 million into network improvements to
improvemonitoringforfaults,toshortenrecoverytimes,andtoincreasethecapacityandpathdiversityof
itscriticalsignalingchannels.
The multiple outages over this four-month period are described below. Telstra constantly stresses in its
marketing messages the dependability of its network. However, it is clear that Telstra’s network is as
pronetofailureasanyothernetwork.

There was evidence of an increasing degradation in the health of one of the nodes in the network, and
the decision was made to isolate the node from the network. A Telstra engineer took the node down for
maintenance,buthefailedtofollowthecorrectprocedureforreroutingtraffic.Ratherthantransferringthe
customers connected to that node to other nodes in the network, he reconnected them to the
malfunctioningnode.

On Thursday, March 17th, Telstra suffered an hours-long national voice and data outage that lasted into
Friday, March 18th. This was the third outage in less than a month. Up to 8 million Telstra users
sporadically lost Internet, phone, and SMS service. This represents about half of Telstra’s 16.7 million
mobile customers. Furthermore, with no Internet service, merchants’ POS terminals were out of service.

Telstra lost its ADSL network Friday morning, May 20th. The outage was due to a “complex network
management device fault.” The “management device” controlled the interaction between the network and
allofthedifferenttypesofmodemsusedbyitscustomers.
Service was restored that evening, but customers had to reset their ADSL modems in order to get back
online. This procedure was not obvious to many Telstra customers. Telstra pointed them to a support
page that provided the procedure for resetting modems. However, it took until Tuesday for many

Telstra’s Move for Improvement
CustomerCompensation
In an effort to compensate customers for the outages, Telstra offered them a pair of ‘free data’ Sundays
on which customers could download any amount of material they desired. The first free data day on
Sunday, February 14th, was quite successful. Telstra customers downloaded 2.3 million movies. It was
Telstra’sbusiestdayever.
Its second free data day on Sunday, April 3rd, backfired. Heavy demand caused massive delays. Many
downloads took hours tocompleteor evenfailedtostart.Thousands of customerstook tosocialmediato

Following a review of its outages by internal and external specialists, Telstra has committed to spend
AU$50 million on upgrading its network. AU$25 million will be spent on improving monitoring of its
network,andAU$25millionwillbetargetedtowardsimprovingrecoverytimes.
Telstra is also adding capacity to its core networks and is increasing the number of redundant links to its
nodes. It has added new software features that limit the number of customers who would be required to
re-register following a fault as well as increasing the capacityto handle a large number of re-registrations
occurring simultaneously. It is making other network changes to reduce the impact of international IP
trafficondomestictraffic.
