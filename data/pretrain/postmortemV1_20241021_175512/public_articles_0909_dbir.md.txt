2014 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report
September2014
This is the tenth year that Verizon has issued its Verizon Data Breach Investigations
Report (DBIR).1 The DBIR analyzes reported security incidences, data breaches (those
in which data was exposed), and confirmed data disclosures (those in which information
wasactuallystolen.
The reports for the 2014 DBIR come from fifty contributing organizations. All
inall,this reportcovers 63,437securityincidences thatresultedin1,367 data
breaches. The security incidences originated from 95 different countries
aroundtheworld.
Verizonusesthefollowingdefinitions:
 SecurityIncident–asecurityeventthatcompromisestheintegrity,confidentiality,oravailabilityof
aninformationasset.
 Breach–asecurityincidentthatresultsintheexposureorpotentialexposureofdata.
 Data Disclosure – a breach for which it was confirmed that data was actually disclosed to an
unauthorizedparty.
2014 was the year of large-scale attacks on payment card systems, with the Target hack of 110 million
credit cards and debit cards bringing this attention to everyone.2 However, attacks were made against
manyindustries.The2014DBIRrecordsdatabreachesagainstthefollowingindustries:

Thereasons for theattackshave changed over time.Thetwo primaryattack motives have beenfinancial
and espionage. Financial attacks are aimed at obtaining data such as bank account credentials or
payment-card information that is easily converted
to cash. Espionage attacks attempt to access
internalcorporatedataortradesecrets.
Four years ago, financial motives accounted for
almost90%ofallattacks.In2013,thatpercentage
dropped significantly due to the increase in
espionageattacks,whichaccountedforabout25%
of all attacks in 2013. A few attacks have been
motivated by ideology, especially the DDoS
attacks against major U.S. banks in late 2012 and
early 2013 by an Islamic group attempting to get
the offensive video “Innocence of Muslims”
removedfromYouTube.3
Almost all breaches have been initiated by one of
four “threat actors.” These include external and
internalattackers,partners,andcollusions(attacks
initiated by external, internal, or partner actors
workingtogether).
Most attacks over the years have been launched by external actors. In 2013, external attacks accounted
for about 80% of all attacks. Internal attacks have consistently been a remote number 2, accounting for
about10%ofattacksin2013.
Verizon was able to categorize most of the security incidents into nine categories. These categories

POS Intrusions
A POS Intrusion is an attack in which POS devices are compromised. Typically, malware is installed in
the POS terminals of a retail establishment (retailers, hotels, grocery stores) to collect magnetic-stripe
datafromthememoryoftheterminals.Mostoftheseattacksareattributedtocriminalgroupsoperatingin
RussiaandEasternEurope.
In99% of thecases,thevictim learnedof theattack throughathirdparty,often apayment-cardcompany
that has tracked down the usage of multiple cards involved in fraudulent transactions. These attacks are
reportedtolawenforcementagencies,whichcanthendiscoverrelatedbreaches.
In almost all cases, it took onlyminutes to launch an attack, but discovery was not until weeks or months
later.Thisdelaydependedinlargepartuponthelengthoftimetheattackertooktocashin.Thelongerhe

 Installandmaintainanti-virussoftwareonPOSsystems.
 SegmentPOSnetworkenvironmentsfromthecorporatenetwork.
 Monitornetworkforsuspiciousactivity.
 Usetwo-factorauthentication.
Web App Attacks
A Web App Attack exploits a weakness in a web-based application. A typical weakness is inadequate
inputdatavalidation,suchastherecentwide-spreadHeartbleedvulnerability.4
Another strategy to gain access to a web application is to use stolen credentials to impersonate a user.
Such information is gained by phishing, password guessing, and SQL injection attacks. Many of these
attacksresultininfectingaserverforinclusioninabotnetforDDoSattacks.

Insider and Privilege Misuse
Privilege Misuse attacks involve taking advantage of the system access privileges granted by an
employer toanemployeeor partner who uses theaccess privileges tocommitnefarious acts.Theseacts
can range from self-serving (gaining information to aid in promotions) to those aimed at financial gain or
espionage.
Often, the attacker makes off with sensitive information by writing it to a USB drive or be emailing it to
himself. In some cases, attackers have stolen someone else’s credentials to obtain their privileges or

The predominant industries victimized by privilege misuse include Public, Real Estate, Administrative,
Transportation,Manufacturing,andMining.
Verizon’srecommendedcontrolsforprivilegemisuseattacksinclude:
 Buildcontrolstoprotectdataanddetectmisuse.
 Reviewuseraccounts.
 Watchfordataexfiltration.
 Publish anonymized results of audits of actions to alert employees that their actions are being
monitored.
Physical Theft and Loss
Physical Theft and Loss involves an information asset that went missing either through misplacement or
malice.Informationassetsinvolvelaptops,diskdrives,anddocuments.
The predominant root cause in Theft and Loss attacks is employee carelessness. Fifteen times more
assets go missing because of loss rather than theft. When it comes to theft, 43% of all thefts are from
employees’ workplaces. Theft from employees’ personal vehicles accounts for 23% and 10% from their
personalresidences.
ThepredominantindustriesaffectedbyphysicaltheftandlossincludeHealthcare,Public,andMining.
Verizon’srecommendedcontrolsforphysicaltheftandlossinclude:
 Encryptinformation(andcheckencryptionperiodically).
 Keepsensitivedevicesinsightandinpossessionatalltimes.
 Regularandpreferablyautomaticbackupofallcriticalinformationonadevice.
 Lockdevicesdown.
 Useunappealingtechnology(oldlaptops,disguisedlaptops).

Miscellaneous Errors
Miscellaneous Errors include unintentional actions that directly compromise a security attribute of an
information asset. Highly repetitive and mundane business processes involving sensitive information are
particularlyerrorprone.
Examples of miscellaneous errors include sending paper documents or emails to the wrong recipient
(49%),accidentallypostingnon-publicinformationtoapublicwebsite(29%),anddisposalerrors(20%).
The predominant industries affected by miscellaneous errors include Public, Administrative, and Health
Care.
Verizon’srecommendedcontrolsformiscellaneouserrorsinclude:
 UseDataLossPreventionsoftwaretotrackemailrecipients.
 Tightenupprocessesforpostingdocumentstointernalandexternalsites.
 Spot-check samples of large mailings to ensure that the name on the envelope matches the
contents.
 Sanitizeassetssuchascomputersanddisksbeforedisposingofthem.
Crimeware
Crimeware attacks attempt to gain control of systems as a platform for illicit purposes, such as stealing
credentials, DDoS attacks, spamming, artificially boosting ad revenue, etc. Crimeware attacks consist
primarilyofopportunisticinfectionstiedtoorganizedcriminalswithfinancial,espionage,orothermotives.
A Crimeware attack is fairly simple to launch. There are online markets that offer Cybercrime-as-a-
Service.
The predominant industries victimized by Crimeware attacks include Public, Information, Utilities, and
Manufacturing.
Verizon’srecommendedcontrolsformiscellaneouserrorsinclude:
 Keepbrowsersandplug-insuptodate.
 DisableJavainbrowsers.
 Usetwo-factorauthentication.
 Deploysystemconfigurationchangemonitoring.
 Usethreadsofthreatdatatoacceleratedetection.
Payment-Card Skimmers
In a Payment-Card Skimmer attack, a skimming device is physically implanted on an assed that reads
magnetic-stripe data from a credit card. 87% of affected devices are ATMs. Gas pumps account for 9%,
andPOSterminalsandotherdevicesmakeuptherest.
The skimming devices are realistic in appearance and are difficult to spot by the untrained user. They

Distributed Denial of Service Attacks
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is intended to compromise the availability of networks and
systems to take down a company’s web portals. DDoS attacks have become more frequent, larger, and
longer.ArecentattackagainstSpamhauscomprised300gigabits/secondofdatalaunchedatitfordays.5
DDoS attacks are launched from botnets of thousands of infected PCs or servers under the control of a
botmaster.
ThepredominantindustriesvictimizedbyDDoSattacksincludeFinance,Retail,Professional,Information,
andPublic.
Verizon’srecommendedcontrolsforDDoSattacksinclude:
 Servers and services should always be patched when in use, turned off when not in use, and
available only to the people who need them to keep them from being infected with DDoS attack
malware.

Conclusions
Verizonnotesthefollowingcharacteristicsthatapplytoagreatnumberoftheattacksthatitstudied:
 Aside from DDoS attacks, in most cases it took weeks to months for the victim to discover the
breach, though it only took a few minutes to launch the attack. Most attacks were discovered by
outsiders.
 Most security incidences did not result in data disclosures except for POS Infiltration and
Payment-CardSkimmingattacks.!00%oftheseattacksresultedindatadisclosures.
 Phishing and browser infections are the primary threat actions. A phishing campaign of only ten
emailmessageshasa90%chanceofgettingatleastoneclick-through.
Verizon’s 2014 Data Breach Investigations Report is well-written, informative, and easy to understand.
The seven pages in this review are expanded to fifty-eight pages in the report. We recommend that
