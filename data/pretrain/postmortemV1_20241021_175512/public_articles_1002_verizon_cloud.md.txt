Verizon Cloud Down for Forty Hours
February2015
Verizon has its sights set on becoming one of the major cloud providers, joining
competitors such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Rackspace. The youngest of the
cloudplayers,Verizoncameonlinewithitscloudofferingjustfour yearsago.Verizonhas

However, in early January 2015, Verizon announced a planned downtime of up to 48 hours for its cloud
services over the weekend of Saturday, January10th. This is hardlythe action to take to elicit confidence

The Verizon Cloud
Verizon originally entered the cloud marketplace with Verizon Enterprise Cloud. It is now replacing that
cloud service with new services that it calls Verizon Cloud Compute and Verizon Cloud Storage. It refers
toitsVerizonEnterpriseCloudasits“legacy”cloud.
TheVerizonEnterpriseCloud
Verizon began its cloud business via the acquisition of Terremark Worldwide, Inc., in January, 2011.
Terremark provides managed hosting, colocation, disaster recovery, data storage, and cloud computing
servicesviaitsthirteendatacentersintheUnitedStates,Europe,andLatinAmerica.
Terremark’s cloud-computing services are remarketed by Verizon as the Verizon Enterprise Cloud.

Terremark has had a rocky road. It is generally perceived as one of the highest quality managed hosting
and cloud service providers. The U.S. government chose Terremark to host its USA.gov and Data.gov
web sites. However, it also chose Terremark to host the web site for HealthCare.gov, the failed web site
for ObamaCare. In October, 2013, Kathleen Sebelius, the U.S. Secretaryof Health and Human Services,
identifiedTerremark as the companyresponsiblefor the“outages that disrupted the website” whenit was
initiallyrolledout.Thecontractwasre-awardedtoHewlett-Packard.
Verizon’sNewCloud
Verizon realized that in order to compete effectively with other cloud services, it had to provide a unique
service that excelled all others. It studied what needed to be changed to achieve this goal and decided
that“everythinghadtochange.”Itthereforesetouttobuildanentirelynewcloudplatform.
Rather than using a standard, off-the-shelf hypervisor to host its virtual machines, Verizon developed its
own hypervisor. One enhancement that it built into its new hypervisor was the ability to run native virtual

machine images from other clouds. It also provided the ability for customers to choose their own
processing power and storage capacities from a continuous spectrum rather than from preconfigured
combinations, as most other clouds provide. The pay-as-you-go charges for compute capacity and
storagecanbesimplychargedtothecustomer’screditcard.
The new cloud was also intended to provide seamless upgrades. Seamless upgrades allow Verizon to
updateitshardware,software,andfirmwarewithnoplanneddowntime.
Another departure was to use solid-state storage devices (SSDs) rather than hard disks. As a result, a
virtual machine in the Verizon cloud can support up to 5,000 input/output operations per second. All data
is replicated multiple times within a data center or between geographically dispersed data centers.
Verizon Cloud Storage supports Amazon’s S3 protocol and the OpenStack Swift protocol as well as the
DAVprotocolfromHTTPwebservers.
Verizon’s new cloud offering is built on an entirely new hardware platform. Its host servers use a single,
heavily customized version of AMD’s SeaMicro eight-core computer chip. 64 servers with 64 GB of main
memorycanbepackedintoasingle1Uchassis.
Verizon’s new cloud services, dubbed Verizon Cloud Compute and Verizon Cloud Storage, were
announced in 2013. They become generally available in October, 2014, after a year of beta testing. In

The new cloud services do not affect customers using Verizon’s legacy Enterprise Cloud. However,

The Verizon Cloud Update
Verizon shocked the cloud community when it announced on January5,2015, that it would take down its
Cloud Compute and Cloud Storage systems for routine maintenance for up to 48 hours starting in the
early morning hours of Saturday, January 10th. There was no plan to move active virtual machines to
other operating physical servers in other data centers during the maintenance period. All hosted virtual
machines (VMs) in all data centers would be unavailable. The Twitter universe was filled with angry and
sarcasticcommentsaboutVerizon’slackofconcernfortheavailabilityofitscloudservices.
Verizon explained that the update’s purpose was to enable “seamless upgrades.” There would be no
need in the future for planned downtime when updates were made. But wasn’t this already supposed to
be a capability of its new cloud services? Verizon explained that some elements of the new architecture
had not been optimized in the first release. One was the ability to apply firmware changes non-
disruptively.Thisupdatewouldaddthatcapability.
However, Verizon stated that the affected corporate customers represented only a small fraction of those
currentlyusing Verizon’s clouds.None of the legacycloud users would be affected,andmosthad not yet

The Long-Term Benefit of the Two-Day Upgrade
As it turned out, the update took 40 hours. Verizon amazingly escaped scathing comments following the
upgrade.Customersseemtohaveacceptedtheoutage.
Now, according to Verizon, its new cloud services truly support seamless upgrade capabilities. There
should be no downtime in the future for any upgrade activity, whether the upgrade be for hardware,
software, or firmware. There will be no need for customers to reboot VMs after any maintenance or
upgrade action. Seamless upgrades also mean that customers do not have to set up VMs in multiple
regions or fault domains to survive upgrades (though of course this is still necessary to protect against
serveroutagesordata-centeroutages).

This capability is particularly meaningful in light of the recent security vulnerability discovered in the Xen
hypervisor in September,2014.1Theflaw allowedone VMtoread thememoryof other VMs on thesame
host server. Correcting this flaw meant that many major cloud services, Amazon and Verizon included,
hadtotakedownmassivenumbersofvirtualmachines;andtheseVMshadtoberebooted.
Perhapsit was this experiencethatencouragedVerizontoaddfirmwareupdatestoitsseamlessupgrade
capability. Verizon now can perform upgrades affecting active virtual machines without having to move

Summary
In implementing its seamless upgrade capability to include firmware updates, Verizon risked earning the
wrath of its enterprise customers by taking down all cloud services for almost two days. Clearly, if a
corporation had not planned for such an unexpected event, it might not have been able to provide critical
servicesduringtheoutage.
However, Verizon seems tohave weathered thestorm.Itis now in a verystrongposition relative to other
cloud offerings in that it claims that it can perform any type of upgrade to its cloud infrastructure with no
planned downtime. If it would have had this capability when the Xen hypervisor vulnerability was
exposed, it would have been unique among cloud providers using Xen in that it could have patched Xen
withnoplanneddowntimeandnorequirementtorebootactivevirtualmachines.
