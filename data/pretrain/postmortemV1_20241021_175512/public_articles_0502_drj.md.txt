The Disaster Recovery Journal
Founded in 1987 by Richard Arnold and managed by
Robert Arnold, the Disaster Recovery Journal (DRJ) is a
quarterly publication containing in each issue about twenty
articles on the topics of business continuity and disaster
recovery. It is available free-of-charge in hard copy as a
100-page full-color magazine and as an online publication
postedtoitswebsite.Simplysignupforitatwww.drj.com.
The articles are for the most part aimed at IT management
and deal with business issues rather than technical
solutions. Written by professionals in the field – end users,
consultants, and vendors - the articles are quick and easy
to read, each being about three pages in length. Thus, the
Disaster Recovery Journal provides a wide range of
coveragethatiseasilyassimilated.
DRJ has archived all of its articles (as articles until 1998
and as the full magazine thereafter) on its web site.
