FalconStor RecoverTrac – Automated Disaster Recovery
June2012
In our companion article, Recovery-as-a-Service (RaaS),1 we described emerging cloud services that
provide data center backup protection for major outages. The FalconStor RecoverTrac disaster recovery

Downtime and lost data can be catastrophic for a company. In extreme cases, as evidenced by the
aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, companies often cannot survive days of downtime or
thelossoftheircorporatedata.
Companies today invest heavily in backup and recovery infrastructure to protect their mission-critical
applications. Classic tape backup procedures are unacceptable for truly critical applications since they
maytake days to recover as the full and incremental backup tapes are loaded. Even worse, days of data
–allchangessincethelastbackup–maybelost.
Consequently, companies are moving to hot backup sites in which dedicated servers are booted and
ready to be put into service. A synchronized copyof the application and system data is maintained at the
backupsiteviadatareplication.Thebackupsitecanbebroughtintofullproductionfollowingaproduction
center outage in just a few hours, and only that data caught in the replication pipeline – typically minutes
–islost.
However, failover to the backup site following a production site outage is a complex process and often
goes afoul. Many things can go wrong in the heat of the outage crisis as dozens or hundreds of
interrelated steps must be accurately executed. Human error, incompatible hardware or software
versions, failover process flaws, and network problems are only a few of the challenges that can impede
a failover. Because failover is such a complex and risky process, it is seldom tested thoroughly. Rather,

The FalconStor RecoverTrac2 tool solves these problems for hypervisor and physical platforms including
Windows and Linux systems. It provides a completely automated recovery solution that can provide
recovery times often measured in less than an hour with data loss measured in minutes. Equally
important is that failover can be easily tested so that it is assured that it will be successful in a real-life
crisis.

Heterogeneity in a Disaster Recovery Configuration
Data centers have grown up over a long period of time. As a consequence, they are generally populated
by a multiplicity of heterogeneous physical servers, virtual servers, storage systems, and operating
systems.Today’sdisasterrecoverysolutionstypicallydonotsupportheterogeneity.
For instance, VMware’s Site Recovery Manager supports production systems that are running virtual
machines on VMware ESX servers only. Physical servers are not supported, nor are other hypervisors.
ThesamecanbesaidforCitrix’SiteRecoveryforXenServer.
FalconStor’s RecoverTrac solves the heterogeneityproblem to a great extent. It supports virtual-to-virtual
(V2V), physical-to-physical (P2P), and physical-to-virtual (P2V) failover configurations. For V2V failover,
the production system can be running virtual machines (VMs) on any certified hypervisor (VMware,
Microsoft Hyper-V, or Citrix XenServer). RecoverTrac is capable of failing these VMs over to either
VMwareorHyper-Vvirtualenvironments.
For P2V recovery, RecoverTrac recovers the physical server to an appropriately configured virtual
machine in the recovery center. P2P failover requires that there be a physical server of the same make
andmodelintherecoverycenter.
RecoverTrac’s Replication Channel
In order to bring up a physical backup server or a VM in the recovery center, a current copy of the
application’s database and its operating system image must be available in the recovery center. This is
accomplished via the FalconStor Continuous Data Protector (CDP) replication engine. Replication is
heterogeneous – FalconStor CDP can replicate from any supported database or application. Supported
databases include Oracle, DB2, Informix, Ingress, SQL Server, MySQL, and Sybase. Supported
applications include SAP, Lotus Notes, and Exchange, among others. The replication target at the

FalconStor CDPsupports one-to-one,one-to-many,many-to-one,andmany-to-manyreplicationstreams.
For instance, one recovery center can act as the backup for multiple production sites. Alternatively, the
backup of one data center may be distributed among several recovery centers for load-balancing
purposes.
RecoverTrac can operate by itself or in conjunction with other disaster recovery configurations. For

The FalconStor CDP appliance at the production center is fed by an agent resident on each protected
physical or virtual production machine and supports both direct attached storage and storage arrays. The
agentsitsbetweentheapplicationsandthefilesystemofthehostserver.Theagentcomprises:
 MicroScan, which monitors for disk writes that will be replicated. It deduplicates the write byselecting
only the sector or sectors out of the disk block that have changed. Typically, only 512 bytes out of a

RecoverTrac Failover and Fallback
Given a synchronized copy of the production databases at the recovery center, RecoverTrac provides
automatic or manual failover of a failed production environment to the recovery data center. Once the
production environment is returned to service, RecoverTrac seamlessly manages the fallback process to
restorenormaloperationsattheproductioncenter.
RecoverTrac runs in its own server, as shown in Figure 2. It has communication and control links with all
of the protected servers at the production site, the backup servers at the recovery site, and the
FalconStorCDPreplicationappliances.
Failover
RecoverTrac provides fully automated recovery or manual recovery through a management interface.
The recovery decision is often a manual process as it must be determined whether it would be faster to
trytorecoverthefailedproductionsystemsortofailovertotheirbackupsystems.
RecoverTrac automates the entire recovery process. When RecoverTrac is notified of a production
outage requiring failover to the recovery site, it will boot the required VMs and physical servers with their
operating system images at the recovery site, and it will mount the pertinent application databases. It

changes the IP addresses used by the users so that they are now routed to their recovery backup
systems,andproductionprocessingproceeds.
Failed virtual machines can be failed over to either a Microsoft Hyper-V or a VMware ESX hypervisor.
Likewise, failed physical machines can be failed over to VMs running under either of these hypervisors.
Alternatively, physical machines may be failed over to other physical machines of the same make and
model.

of its snapshots at a specified point in time. This latter capability is useful, for instance, if a database
shouldbecomecorrupted.
Fallback
When the production environment is returned to service, applications are returned to the production site
viathefallbackprocess.RecoverTracfullyautomatesthefallbackprocess.
Fallback is essentially the reverse of failover. The first step is to use the FalconStor CDP replication
engine to bring the production databases and system images into synchronization with the current
recovery environment. The production physical servers and virtual machines are rebooted from their
system images, and application databases are mounted. Finally, the user IP addresses are redirected to
theproductionenvironment.Normalprocessingattheproductionsiteisnowrestored.

Other Uses
RecoverTraccanbeusedforavarietyofotherpurposes:
 Testing DR failover: Perhaps one of the most important uses for RecoverTrac beyond disaster
recovery is the ability to test failover in a test environment without impacting production. In this case,
therecoveryenvironmentisbroughtintooperationjustasitwouldbeinarealemergency,butuserIP
addresses are not changed. Users continue to use the production environment. The recovery
environment can be tested, and then the recovery databases resynchronized to return it to backup
mode.
 Local bare metal recovery: A recoverymachine located at the production site can run a recoveryjob,

 Remote Test/Development Team Data Refresh: Special recovery jobs can be scheduled to
synchronize test and development machines at remote sites for data mining, testing, and analysis.

 Site migration for workload balancing and workload distribution: Recoverymachines can be activated
at remote data centers to move some workload from the current production servers to the recovery
servers duringperiods of peak processingactivity.Whenthe workloadsubsides,the workloadcanbe
