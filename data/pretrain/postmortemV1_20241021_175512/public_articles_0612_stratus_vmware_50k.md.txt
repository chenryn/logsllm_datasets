Stratus Puts $50,000 Where Its Mouth Is - Again
December2011
Two years ago, Stratus Technologies (www.stratus.com) bet $50,000 that its fault-
tolerant ftServer would not go down in the first six months of operation. If you bought
a system by the end of February, 2010, and if it failed in its first six months of
operation,Stratuswouldpayyou$50,000incash(orinproductcreditifyouwanted).1

Stratus’ vSphere Guarantee
Stratus is now doing it again, but with a slightly different twist – virtualization. Stratus is betting $50,000
that Tier 1 enterprise applications are virtualization-ready and will not fail – provided they are running on
StratusftServersandVMware’svSpherecloudoperatingsystem.
Critical virtualized applications depend upon an extremely reliable infrastructure on which to run. If a
server goes down, not just one application is lost. All applications running on that server are down until
they can be failed over to another server – a process that can take an hour or more for large, complex
applications.Theimpactofafailedserverisamplifiedmanyfoldinavirtualizedenvironment.
Stratus supports VMware on their ftServers to provide fault tolerance to virtualized environments. Stratus
has worked closely with VMware to harden the virtualized environment and to protect it against both
hardware (Stratus) and software (VMware) failures. They feel so confident in the results that they are
once again betting $50,000 against a failure. But this time, they are not wagering on only their ftServer.

ftServerArchitecture
The high availability of the Stratus ftServer product line is achieved by running all applications on dual
processors that are lockstepped at the memory access level. Should
there be a disagreement between the processors, one of the
processors has suffered a fault. If the faulty processor has detected its
own fault, that processor is taken out of service. Otherwise, each
processor enters a self-test mode; and the processor in error is taken
outofservice.
Each processor contains its own I/O subsystem. In normal operation,
peripheral devices are driven by both I/O subsystems via a multi-path connection. However, if an I/O
subsystemdetectsamalfunction,itwillremoveitselffromservice.

Each logical processor is connected to each of the I/O subsystems. In this way, any combination of one
logicalprocessorfailureandoneI/Osubsystemfailurewillnotrenderthesysteminoperable.
Each processor contains not only its logical microprocessor cores, memory, and I/O subsystem but also
three 500 gigabyte integrated disks. Thus, each logical processor has direct access to 1.5 terabytes of
local storage. This storage is mirrored between the slices, providing fault-tolerant storage within the
ftServeritself.
HardenedCommodityOperatingSystems
TheWindowsandRedHatLinuxoperatingsystemsthatStratussupportsarethosethatarecommercially
available to anyone. Therefore, the ftServers are application binary interface (ABI) compatible with
Windows and Linux applications. Any application that can run under Windows or Red Hat Linux on an
industry-standard server can run on an ftServer without modification. The installation and administration
procedures are identical. The user should see no difference except for downtime – and that is the big
difference.
When a new operating system version is about to be released, Stratus engineers do everything that they
can to break it. Stratus engineers claim that they have not yet found a device driver that they could not
break. Faults that involve the operating system are reported back to Microsoft and Red Hat, who make
corrections to eliminate the sources of those failures. Everyone benefits from this effort because it is the
hardenedversionthatis releasedfor public use.TheWindows andRedHatLinux operatingsystems that

StratusCallHome
All Stratus servers monitor themselves for faults. If a problem of any kind is detected, the system will
automatically call a Stratus support facility (provided customer permission has been granted to do so);

Virtualization
Virtualization technology allows many virtual machines to run on a single server. Virtualization is an
importanttechniqueforgettingfullutilizationoutoflargeserverfarms.
A problem faced with virtualization technology is that availability becomes far more important. One
particular application may not have a high value and can suffer some downtime without serious
consequence. However, run many of these as virtual machines on a single server, and a server failure
becomesmuchmorecostly.
Stratus has integrated the ftServer with VMware’s vSphere to allow ftServers to host many virtual
Windows and Linux machines in any combination. vSphere sits on top of the ftServer hardware and
supports multiple instances of different operating systems running as if they were in their own physical
server.
As a result, it is very simple to add a fault-tolerant pool of servers to a virtualized server farm. It is this
integrationofftServerwithVMware’svSpherethatStratusiswageringwillnotfail.

Summary
The impact on system availability of fault-tolerant, vendor-supplied hardware and software is rapidly
diminishing to the point that it is no longer a significant factor. Systems such as Stratus’ ftServer
effectively take these systems out of the availability equation. Rather, availability is determined today by
application bugs, operator errors, and environmental faults such as power, cooling, and data-center
destruction.
Continuous availability is no longer a technological problem. It is an exercise in balancing system cost
with downtime cost. Stratus’ ftServer is an affordable starting point to achieve extreme availabilities.
