Reliability Diagrams
July2011
Most highly available systems in use today are complex assemblies of redundant components.
Wemayknowthereliabilitycharacteristicsofeachcomponentinthesystem,buthowcanweuse

The reliability diagram is an important tool to achieve this end. In this article, we look at reliability
diagrams and give an example of how to use them to calculate the availability of complex
systems.
Probability 101
When it comes to availability, we are often concerned about binary states. For instance, we are
concerned about whether the state of a system is up (operational) or down (failed). This is a
binarysystem–thestatementthatthesystemisupiseithertrueorfalse.
The value (true or false) of a binary state can be specified as a Boolean function with operators
AND,OR,andNOT.For instance,itmaybethatacertainstateis true if x AND yaretrueOR if z
isNOT true.Knowingtheprobabilitiesof x,y,and z,whatistheprobabilityofthe system beingin
thatstate?
Let p(k) be the probability that k is true. These Boolean functions transform into the following
probabilityequations.
AND
TheANDoperatorimpliesmultiplication.TheprobabilitythatxANDyaretrueis
p(x ANDy)p(x)p(y) (1)
For instance,consider dice.Whatistheprobabilityof rollinga2onthefirstrollofadiceandthen
rolling a 4 on the second try? The probability of rolling a 2 is 1/6. The probability of rolling a 4 is
1/6.Theprobabilityofrollinga2onthefirstrollANDrollinga4onthesecondrollis
p(2AND4)=p(2)p(4)=(1/6)(1/6)=1/36

p(x ORy)p(x)p(y) (2)
Modifying our above example somewhat, what is the probability of rolling either a 2 or a 4 on the
firstroll?Theprobabilityofrollingeitheris1/6.Theprobabilityofrollinga2ORofrollinga4is
p(2OR4)=p(2)+p(4)=1/6+1/6=1/3
Thechanceofrollingeithera2ora4onarollofthediceisonetimeoutofeverythreetries.1
NOT
Theprobabilitythateventzisnottrueis
p(zNOTtrue)=p(NOTz)=1–p(z) (3)
This is obvious since event zis either true or not true. Therefore, the probability that z is true OR
theprobabilitythatzisNOTtrueisone.Thatis,p(z)+p(NOTz)=p(z)+1–p(z)=1.
Forinstance,iftheprobabilityofrollinga1is1/6,theprobabilityofNOTrollinga1is
p(NOT1)=(1–1/6)=5/6

Application to System Availability
Complex systems comprise a wide variety of components, such as processors, storage devices,
networks, user terminals, power-distribution systems, and so on. We will call each of these
componentsinasystemanodeofthesystem.
When considering system availability, there are two major configurations into which the nodes of
any system can usually be broken down. They are a parallel (or redundant) configuration and a
serialconfiguration.

RedundantConfigurations
In a redundant configuration, two (or more) nodes run in parallel.
For instance, there may be two processors backing each other
up.Theremaybetwonetworksavailableforuse.Sometimes,the
workload is split between them. In other configurations, one acts Node1 Node2
as a backup to the primary node and can take over should the a1 a2
primary node fail. In any event, the system is up so long as at
leastonenodeisoperational.
Letuscallthesenodes node1 withanavailabilityof a1andnode
2withanavailabilityofa2.Thus,
probability(node1isup)=a1
probability(node2isup)=a2
Furthermore,
probability(node1isdown)=probability(node1isNOTup)=(1-a1)
probability(node2isdown)=probability(node2isNOTup)=(1-a2)
The probability that the system is down is the probability that node 1 is down AND node 2 is
down:
probability(systemisdown)=(1-a1)(1-a2)
TheprobabilitythatthesystemisupistheprobabilitythatitisNOTdown:
probability(systemisup)=1–(1-a1)(1-a2) (4)
WeuseEquation(4)tocalculatetheavailabilityofaredundantpairofcomponents.2
For instance, let the availability of node 1 be 0.999 (three 9s) and the probability of node 2 be
0.99(two9s).Thentheavailabilityofthesystemis,fromEquation(4):
a1=0.999
a2=0.99
probability(systemisup)=1–(1-a1)(1-a2)
=1–(1-0.999)(1–0.99)=1-0.001x0.01
=1–0.00001=0.99999
Pairing a three-9s system with a two-9s
system in a redundant configuration yields a
system with a much higher availability of five
9s.Thisleadstoausefulrule:
The availability of a redundant
system is equal to the sum of the 9s
ofthecomponentnodes.

For instance, if one node has an availabilityof 0.992, and if its backup node has an availabilityof
0.95, youcansaythattheredundantsystem hasanavailabilityofmorethanthreenines(itwill,in
fact,be0.9996).
This rule applies to any number of parallel nodes. If three processors are backing each other up
with availabilities of 0.9, 0.99, and 0.999 respectively, the resulting processor complex has an
availabilityofsix9s.
SerialConfigurations
In a serial configuration, two or more nodes depend upon each other to keep the
system operational. If one node fails, the system fails. For instance, a processing
nodeandastoragenodemustbothbeupinorderforthesystemtobeup.
Consider a two-node serial system with node 1 having an availability of a1 and
node2havinganavailabilityofa2:
probability(node1isup)=a1
probability(node2isup)=a2
Thesystemisuponlyifbothnode1ANDnode2areoperational.Therefore,
p(systemup)=a1xa2 (5)
Equation (5) applies to any number of nodes in series. If
there are n nodes, the overall availability of the
configurationistheproductofallnavailabilities.
As an example, consider two serial nodes with the
availabilities that we used in the redundant example
above. Node 1 has an availability of 0.999, and node 2
has an availability of 0.99. The availability of the serial
systemis,fromEquation(5):
a1=0.999
a2=0.99
p(systemup)=a1xa2=0.999x0.99=0.989
If there were three serial nodes with availabilities of 0.995, 0.998, and 0.9993, the system
availabilitywouldbe0.995x0.998x0.9993=0.9923.
Notice that the system availability of a serial system is less than any of the nodal availabilities. A
systemcannotbemorereliablethanitsweakestlink.
ComplexSystems
Systemscanbemorecomplexthantheparallelandserialsystemsconsideredabove.Theremay
be a network of subsystems in a serial/parallel configuration. The first step in analyzing the
availability of a complex system is to represent it in a reliability diagram, as shown in Figure 1a.
This diagram shows the availability interaction of all of the system’s nodes expressed as parallel
(redundant)andserialarchitectures.
Theavailabilityofacomplexsystem canbeanalyzedbyfirstcalculatingtheavailabilityofeachof
the parallel subsystems in the complex and by replacing each with a single node with the

more serial subsystems. This process continues until the system has been reduced to a single
nodewithitscalculatedavailability,whichisthesystemavailability.

For instance, consider the system of Figure 1a. It comprises six nodes with availabilities of a1
through a6. We start by noting that there are two parallel subsystems of two nodes each. The
availabilityofthea1/a2parallelsubsystemis
a7=1–(1-a1)(1-a2)
Theavailabilityofthea3/a4subsystemis
a8=1–(1-a3)(1-a4)

We replace these two parallel subsystems with single nodes with availabilities of a7 and a8, as
shown in Figure 1b. This now exposes a two-node serial subsystem with availabilities of a7 and
a8.Itsavailabilityis
a9=a7xa8
The serial subsystem is replaced with a single node with availability a9, as shown in Figure 1c.
Thisleadstoanothertwo-nodeparallelsubsystem withavailabilitiesofa5anda9.Theavailability
ofthisparallelsubsystemis
a10=1–(1-a5)(1-a9)
Replacing this parallel subsystem with a single node with availability a10 gives the configuration
shown in Figure 1d. This again is a two-node serial subsystem, in which the nodes have
availabilitiesofa6anda10.Itsavailabilityis
a11=a6xa10
We have reduced the complex system to a single node, and a11 is the availability of the entire
systemofFigure1a.
An Example
To illustrate the application of these concepts, consider a configuration that is an active/active
system backed up by a hot standby system, as shown in Figure 2. The active/active system
comprises twoprocessingnodes splitacross twosites.Eachof theprocessingnodes has access
to a redundant Fibre Channel Storage Area Network (SAN) that connects the processing nodes
with two identical storage subsystems, one at each site. The storage subsystems use data
replicationtokeepeachinsynchronizationwiththeother.
Theactive/activesystem isupifatleastoneprocessorisupaswellasoneSANandonestorage
subsystem. Alternatively, the active/active system is down if the processor pair is down or if the
dualSANisdownorifthestoragesubsystempairisdown.
Shouldtheactive/activesystemfail,thestandbysystemwilltakeoveroperationsforalltheusers.
In the active/active system, as shown in Figure 2, the availability of the processors used in the
active/active pair is 0.99. The availability of each SAN Fibre Channel network is 0.999. The
availabilityofeachstoragesubsystem(thedatabase)is0.995.
In the backup system, the processor has an availability of 0.95; and its disk subsystem has an
availabilityof0.995.

Summary
Most complex IT systems can be represented as a set of redundant nodes in serial with other
nodes. To calculate the availability of such a system, the first step is to draw a reliability diagram

This analysis has focused on system downtime due only to node failures. However, in reality, a
redundant system is down if it is in the process of failing over. The extension of reliability
diagrams to include failover is discussed in our companion two-part series, Simplifying Failover
