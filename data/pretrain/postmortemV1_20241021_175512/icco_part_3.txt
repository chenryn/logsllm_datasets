[](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/11xx5o0/you_broke_reddit_the_piday_outage/). Outage for over 5 hours when a critical Kubernetes cluster upgrade failed. The failure was caused by node metadata that changed between versions which brought down workload networking.

[Amazon](http://aws.amazon.com/message/2329B7/). An unknown event caused a transformer to fail. One of the PLCs that checks that generator power is in phase failed for an unknown reason, which prevented a set of backup generators from coming online. This affected EC2, EBS, and RDS in EU West.
[](http://allegro.tech/allegro-cast-post-mortem.html). The [Allegro](http://allegro.pl) platform suffered a failure of a subsystem responsible for asynchronous distributed task processing.

Moreover, it partially failed to send daily newsletter with new offers. Also some parts of internal administration panel were affected.
[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter). Use of different units of measurement (metric vs. English) caused Mars Climate Orbiter to fail. There were also organizational and procedural failures[[ref](https://space.stackexchange.com/a/20241)] and defects in the navigation software[[ref](https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/robotic-exploration/why-the-mars-probe-went-off-course)].
[](https://medium.com/xandr-tech/2013-09-17-outage-postmortem-586b19ae4307). A double free revealed by a database update caused all "impression bus" servers to crash simultaneously. This wasn't caught in staging and made it into production because a time delay is required to trigger the bug, and the staging period didn't have a built-in delay.
[](https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/compute/15056#5719570367119360). Successive lightning strikes on their European datacenter (europe-west1-b) caused loss of power to Google Compute Engine storage systems within that region. I/O errors were observed on a subset of Standard Persistent Disks (HDDs) and permanent data loss was observed on a small fraction of those.
[Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/message/680342/). Inability to contact a data collection server triggered a latent memory leak bug in the reporting agent on the storage servers. And there is no graceful degradation handling, thus the reporting agent continuously contacted the collection server in a way that slowly consumed system memory. Also the monitoring system failed to alarm this EBS server's memory leak, also EBS servers generally make very dynamic use of all memory. By Monday morning, the rate of memory loss became quite high and confused enough memory on the affected storage servers which cannot keep with the request handling process. This error got further severed by the inability to do the failover, which resulted in the outage.
[](https://www.chef.io/blog/2014/07/10/supermarket-intermittent-unresponsiveness-postmortem/).

When the database backend was overloaded, it had started to throttle requests from various services. Services that hadn't cached the database responses locally began timing out and eventually failed completely.

[](http://cercind.gov.in/2012/orders/Final_Report_Grid_Disturbance.pdf). One night in July 2012, a skewed electricity supply-demand profile developed when the northern grid drew a tremendous amount of power from the western and eastern grids. Following a series of circuit breakers tripping by virtue of under-frequency protection, the entire NEW (northern-eastern-western) grid collapsed due to the absence of islanding mechanisms. While the grid was reactivated after over 8 hours, similar conditions in the following day caused the grid to fail again. However, the restoration effort concluded almost 24 hours after the occurrence of the latter incident.
[](https://status.heroku.com/incidents/642?postmortem). Having a system that requires scheduled manual updates resulted in an error which caused US customers to be unable to scale, stop or restart dynos, or route HTTP traffic, and also prevented all customers from being able to deploy.
[](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/74949623024/2014-01-28-outage-postmortem.html). Fastly configuration change caused backend routing issue. To be exact, the issue is that we were setting the req.backend in a vcl_fetch function, and then calling restart to re-parse the rules. However, calling restart will reset the req.backend to the first backed in the list, which in this case happened to be Manta, rather than the load balanced CouchDB servers.
[](https://www.gps.gov/governance/advisory/meetings/2014-06/beutler1.pdf).

The bug was noticed and rolled back almost immediately due to (?) this didn't fix the issue.
[](https://github.blog/2021-12-01-github-availability-report-november-2021/). Github platform encountered a novel failure mode when processing a schema migration on a large MySQL table. Schema migrations are a common task at GitHub and often take weeks to complete. The final step in a migration is to perform a rename to move the updated table into the correct place. During the final step of this migration a significant portion of our MySQL read replicas entered a semaphore deadlock. Our MySQL clusters consist of a primary node for write traffic, multiple read replicas for production traffic, and several replicas that serve internal read traffic for backup and analytics purposes. The read replicas that hit the deadlock entered a crash-recovery state causing an increased load on healthy read replicas. Due to the cascading nature of this scenario, there were not enough active read replicas to handle production requests which impacted the availability of core GitHub services.
[](https://42gems.com/blog/?p=735). A scripting bug caused the generation of the divider logic in the Pentium to very occasionally produce incorrect results.

[](https://web.archive.org/web/20201018145502/http://yellerapp.com/posts/2014-08-04-postmortem1.html). A network partition in a cluster caused some messages to get delayed, up to 6-7 hours. For reasons that aren't clear, a rolling restart of the cluster healed the partition. There's some suspicious that it was due to cached routes, but there wasn't enough logging information to tell for sure.

The WebKit repository, a Subversion repository configured to use deduplication, became unavailable after two files with the same SHA-1 hash were checked in as test data, with the intention of implementing a safety check for collisions. The two files had different md5 sums and so a checkout would fail a consistency check. For context, the first public SHA-1 hash collision had very recently been announced, with an example of two colliding files.

An operator used a tool with lax input validation to reboot a small number of servers undergoing maintenance but forgot to type `-n` and instead rebooted all servers in the datacenter. This caused an outage that lasted 2.5 hours, rebooted all customer instances, put tremendous load on DHCP/TFTP PXE boot systems, and left API systems requiring manual intervention.
