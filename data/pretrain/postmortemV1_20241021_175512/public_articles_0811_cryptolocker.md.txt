CryptoLocker – Destructive Ransomware
November2013
Ransomware is a class of malware that locks up a computer and demands a ransom
from the computer’s owner to unlock it. Most ransomware only freezes a computer, and

commonvictimsofransomware.
CryptoLocker is a variant of ransomware and is much more dangerous. It does not simply freeze a
computer.Itencryptsallofthefilesonthecomputer.Thoughthecomputerstillruns,itcannotdoanything
because all of thefiles to which it needs access are encrypted with akeythat is notavailabletothe user.

How Does CryptoLocker Work?
CryptoLocker appeared in September, 2013, and has been slowlybut dangerously infecting PCs and the
networks to which they are attached. It attacks all versions ofWindows, includingWindows XP,Windows
Vista,Windows7,andWindows8
It is spread through phishing. Phony emails designed to look like they are from legitimate businesses or
that appear to be UPS or FedEx tracking notifications contain a malicious link or attachment that installs
themalware.CryptoLockerinstallsitselfintheDocumentsandSettingsfolder.
CryptoLocker uses an asymmetric encryption scheme that so far appears uncrackable. Asymmetric
encryption uses a public key and a private key. The public key is known to all. However, decryption
cannotbedonewithouttheprivatekey.
For each victim, CryptoLocker connects to its command-and-control server to download a public key
that is used to encrypt the data. For each new victim, a unique private key is created and only the
CryptoLocker authors have access to these decryption keys. They are stored on their command-
and-control server. The private key for each victim is different, so that an attacked user cannot

All of the files accessible by the user are encrypted. This includes all files on the network to which
theuserhaswriteaccess.
Once the encryption is complete, a pop-up window is displayed notifying the user that his files have
been locked. It describesthe amount of the ransom and how the ransom is to be paid. It also shows

a count-down clock showing how much time the user has to pay the ransom. The total time from
encryptiontoransomistypicallythreetofourdays.
The requested ransom is typically $100 or $300. Payment is requested in MoneyPak vouchers or
bitcoins. Bitcoins are digital currency that is becoming quite popular for online payments. They are
designedtobeanonymous,justlikecash.
If the ransom is paid before the deadline, CryptoLocker will decrypt the files. This process can take
several hours. However, if the clock should run out with no ransom, the key is destroyed and the
filesarelostforever.
CryptoLocker can be detected and deleted by anti-virus utilities, but by the time this happens, it is
too late. The files have been encrypted. Unfortunately, if the anti-virus malware deletes
CryptoLocker before it has finished encrypting all of the files and displaying the pop-up window,

Prevention

 For emails from presumablyknown sources, check the sending email address to ensure that it is
valid. Many spam filters show the actual email address of the sender. If the sender’s address is

known to be billh@gmail.com, but the sender’s address for the email is billh12@gmail.com,
deletetheemail.
 Ignoreemailattachmentsfromunknownsenders.
 Don’t open unexpected attachments from a known sender. Contact them first. .zip, .exe, .pdf,
.doc,and.xlsattachmentscanallcontainviruses.
 Usecautionwithlinksinemails:

- Any email that contains only a link or a link and a distress message from someone you
knowislikelymalware.
- Before clicking any link, hover over it to see the true destination to which the link will take

 Donotacceptanyofferstoinstallanyanti-malwareorotherutilities.
 Thinktwicebeforevisitinganyunknownwebsite.
 Conduct routine backups of important files. Use the services of a backup cloud such as

Mitigation
If you are attacked by CryptoLocker or any other kind of ransomware, immediately disconnect the
infectedsystemfromthenetworktopreventtheinfectionfromspreadingtoothersystems.
Consultwithareputablesecurityexperttoremovethemalwarefrominfectedsystems.
Ifyouhavebackedupyourfiles,deletetheencryptedfilesandrestorethefilesfromthebackup.
Change all passwords after the system has been removed from the network and after the malware has
beendeleted.

Summary
Thegoodnews,if there is any, is thatthehackers haveproventobehonest.Oncepaidtheransom,they
have decrypted files and have not re-infected the computer. However, if the ransom is not paid, be
prepared for further attacks. Security companies have yet to come up with any protection against
CryptoLocker.
