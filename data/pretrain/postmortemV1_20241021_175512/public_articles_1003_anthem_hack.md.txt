Anthem Loses 80 Million Records to Hackers
March2015
Anthem, Inc. is the second largest health insurer in the United States. Part of the Blue
Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) health insurance network, Anthem has almost 40 million
customers in fourteen states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine,
Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Anthem is one of 37
companiesthatinsure105millionpeopleundertheBlueCrossBlueShieldlicense.
Anthem maintains a database of all of its customers plus any customers of other BCBS plans that

OnWednesday,February4th,Anthem announcedthathackershadbreachedits IT systemsandstolethe
personal information of up to 78.8 million BCBS customers and employees. This was the largest data
breachtodateofanyU.S.healthinsurer.
None of this information was encrypted. If Anthem had encrypted its customer data in the database, the

The Anthem Hack
The Anthem attack was unique in one sense. Most malware that steals data is
not discovered by the victim company. Rather, it is reported to the victim by
another company. For instance, the theft of payment-card data (such as that
experienced by Target during the 2013 holiday season1) is often first noticed by one or more issuing
banks that experience a sudden increase in fraudulent purchases. In the case of the Anthem hack,
however,thediscoverywasmadebyanemployee.
On January 27th, a few days before Anthem announced the attack, an Anthem database administrator
discoveredadatabasequeryrunningunder his logininformationthathehadnotinitiated.Hestoppedthe
query and alerted Anthem’s Information Security department. Anthem immediately notified the FBI (the
U.S.FederalBureauofInvestigation).
Anthem personnel also discovered that the login information for five other database administrators had
beencompromised.Itwasfurtherdeterminedthattheattack hadbeeninprogressforoveramonthanda

Fortunately, it appears that no medical information was stolen such as claims, test results, or diagnostic
codes, nor was any financial data such as credit-card or bank-account numbers taken. However, the

stolen data included names, birthdays, social security numbers, street addresses, email addresses,
income data, and BCBS policy numbers. This is sufficient data to open accounts, file fraudulent tax
returns,andeventoreceivemedicalattention.
Many Children Were Victims
Tens of millions of the victims were children that were listed on their parents’ insurance policies. These
children are all subject to identify theft, and there is no straight-forward way for a parent to know of the
theft. Because there is typicallyno historyand no credit applications for children, it is easy to fraudulently
use their information to open accounts, commit tax fraud, and get medical treatment in the name of a
child,leavingtheparentssaddledwithbillsandahealthrecordfortheirchildthatisnolongeraccurate.
It can take years for the theft of child information to come to light. It may not be apparent until a child
applies for credit and is turned down because of defaulted payments. However, there are red flags that

Anthem’s Response
Anthemimmediatelysentanemailtoallofitsmembers:
“ToOurMembers:
Safeguarding your personal, financial, and medical information is one of our top priorities, and
becauseofthat,wehavestate-of-the-artinformationsecuritysystemstoprotectyourdata.
However, despite our efforts, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield was the target of a very sophisticated
external cyberattack. These attackers gained unauthorized access to Anthem’s IT system and have
obtained personal information from our current and former members such as their names, birthdays,
medical IDs/social security numbers, street addresses, e-mail addresses and employment
information,includingincomedata.”
Anthem is workingwithAllClear ID,aleadingidentity-protectionprovider,toprovideautomaticfreecredit-
monitoring and identify-protection services for 24 months for all current and former members of an
affected Anthem plan dating back ten years to 2004. Affected members can also enroll at no cost to
AllClear PRO service during the 24-month coverage period. This service provides a $1 million credit-
monitoring and identity-theft insurance policy (the provision of some personal information is required for
thisservice).
Anthem has set up an informational web site at www.anthemfacts.com that discusses how to go about
credit freezes and fraud alerts via the three credit bureaus so that no new lines of credit can be opened
without a user’s permission. It has also established a toll-free number, 877-263-7995, for a dedicated
investigator who will work torecover anaffectedmember’s financiallosses andtorestorecredit,ensuring

The theft of email addresses and other personal information always leads to a rash of scamming attacks.

Anthem said that it will send a letter and email to everyone whose information was stored in the hacked
database. Anthem further said that it will not call any members regarding the cyberattack. Anthem

Pointing the Finger
Following the attack on the U.S. hospital group Community Health Systems, in which tens of millions of
patients’ health records were stolen, the FBI has warned that the $3 trillion U.S. healthcare industry is
being increasingly targeted. Many health-care companies are still reliant on ageing legacy systems that

Medical identity theft is often more valuable than credit-card theft. Credit cards can be quickly canceled
by banks when fraudulent transactions show up, but medical identity theft is often not immediately
identifiedbypatientsortheirproviders.Criminalshaveyearstomilksuchcredentials.
The FBI has confirmed that it is close to discovering who is behind the Anthem attack, but they will not
confirm any suspect until the agency is absolutely sure. In the past, they have pointed their finger at

Summary
It was fortunate that Anthem discovered the attack fairly immediately(it seems that a month and a half is
sadlya fairlyshort time for discovery of hacking attacks). However, this was enough time for the hackers
tocompromisetheirentiredatabaseofmembersandemployees.
What is unfortunate is that none of Anthem’s sensitive database was encrypted in place. Hacking attacks
are going to stop only when corporations make the investment to incorporate encryption into their
systems so that stolen information has no value. True, this can be a costlymove. However, its cost must
becomparedtothecostandpublicitythataccompaniesamajorhacksuchastheAnthemattack.
