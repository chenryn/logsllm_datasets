(All Times US/Pacific)

**Incident Start:** 12 November 2021 00:30

**Incident End:** 12 November 2021 02:14

**Duration:** 1 hour 44 minutes

**Affected Services and Features:**

-   Cloud Developer Tools

-   Cloud Endpoints

-   Cloud Eventarc

-   Google App Engine

-   Google Cloud Bigtable

-   Google Cloud Console

-   Google Cloud Infrastructure Components

-   Google Cloud Networking

-   Google Cloud SQL

-   Operations

**Regions/Zones:** Europe

**Description:**

Google's Front End load balancing service experienced failures resulting
in impact to several downstream Google Cloud services in Europe. From
preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was caused by a new
infrastructure feature triggering a latent issue within internal network
load balancer code.

**Customer Impact:**

-   Google Cloud Console - Affected customers in Europe were unable to
    load the console, or experienced timeouts.
-   Container Registry - Affected customers were unable to connect to
    the service using the API in europe-west1.
-   Cloud Bigtable - Affected customers in Europe experienced
    unavailable errors and latency for both data and admin operations.
-   Cloud Spanner - Affected customers in Europe experienced unavailable
    errors and latency for both data and admin operations.
-   Cloud Endpoints - Service was unavailable in europe-west1 and
    europe-west4.
-   Firebase Messaging - Affected customers experienced issues receiving
    notifications in asia-southeast1.
-   Cloud SQL - Affected customers experienced probe creation request
    failures in europe-west1, europe-west4, and europe-west5.
-   Cloud Eventarc - Affected customers were unable to create triggers
    in europe-west1.
-   App Engine - Affected customers experienced elevated errors in
    europe-west1.

**Additional details:**

The error was caught within 4 minutes by automated safety systems, and
further spread was slowed at this point. The issue was fully mitigated
approximately 1hr 44m later, when our engineering team completed a
rollout to disable the vulnerable code path. The issue will be fully
prevented going forward via a root cause fix, which will complete
rollout by 12 November 2021 21:00 US/Pacific.

Summary: We are experiencing Networking issues

Description: Mitigation work is currently underway by our engineering
team. We do not have an ETA for mitigation at this point but the
services should be improving at this point.

The issue is affecting:

-   Cloud App Engine : Customers may see traffic drop for us-central1
    and europe-west1.
-   Cloud Bigtable: mitigation still in progress, ETA for resolution
    still unknown
-   Cloud Monitoring UI: There is a mitigation in place at the GFE
    infrastructure level that is rolling out and is expected to resolve
    this issue.
-   Cloud Console: All Cloud Console paths may be unavailable.
-   Cloud Spanner: Customers coming through GFE (not CFE or cloud
    interconnect) will experience UNAVAILABLE error and latency for both
    DATA and ADMIN operations

    europe-west1 and europe-west4 (most affected regions)
-   Cloud SQL:Regions europe-west1,europe-west4 and europe-west5 (could
    be more). Workaround: Users should retry failed operations. Our
    engineering team continues to investigate the issue. We will provide
    an update by Friday, 2021-11-12 03:30 US/Pacific with current
    details. We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.
