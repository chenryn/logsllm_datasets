We\'ve now determined that message corruption was the cause of the

that there were a handful of messages on Sunday morning that had a
single bit corrupted such that the message was still intelligible, but
the system state information was incorrect. \"

Load Balancers returned 502s for some requests they received. The
proportion of 502 return codes varied from 33% to 87% during the period.
Automated monitoring alerted Google's engineering team to the event at
12:19, and at 12:44 the team had identified the probable root cause and
deployed a fix.

\"Today, in an effort to reclaim some technical debt, we deployed new
code that introduced Gatebot to Provision API.\
\
What we did not account for, and what Provision API didn't know about,
was that 1.1.1.0/24 and 1.0.0.0/24 are special IP ranges. Frankly
speaking, almost every IP range is \"special\" for one reason or
another, since our IP configuration is rather complex. But our recursive
DNS resolver ranges are even more special: they are relatively new, and
we\'re using them in a very unique way. Our hardcoded list of Cloudflare
addresses contained a manual exception specifically for these ranges.\
\
As you might be able to guess by now, we didn\'t implement this manual
exception while we were doing the integration work. Remember, the whole
idea of the fix was to remove the hardcoded gotchas!\"

\"On the afternoon of 10 October 2017, we experienced an outage of our
API and Dashboard, lasting 1 hour and 50 minutes. Any requests made
during that time failed, and returned an error.\
\
The cause of the incident was a hardware failure on our primary database
node, combined with unusual circumstances that prevented our database
cluster automation from promoting one of the replica database nodes to
act as the new primary.\
\
This failure to promote a new primary database node extended an outage
that would normally last 1 or 2 minutes to one that lasted almost 2
hours.\"
