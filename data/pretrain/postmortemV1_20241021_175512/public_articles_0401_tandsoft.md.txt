Virtualized Time from TANDsoft
January2009
You want to run an application on your New York-based NonStop server but
need theapplication to think thatit is running in Paris on Paris time.Atthesame
time, other applications on your New York server need to run in New York time.
Butwhywouldyouwanttodothis?
There are many reasons. One is the consolidation of many applications serving worldwide
locations onto a set of servers at a single site. Another is the ability to avoid have to change the
system clock in order to test time-sensitive applications that are currently running with other
applications.
TheOPTA2000ClockandTime-ZoneSimulatorfromTANDsoft(www.tandsoft.com)providesthis
capability with no application modification for all NonStop programming languages and process
types.
The History of OPTA2000
OPTA2000,asitsnameimplies,wasbornoutoftheY2Kproblem.Asthemillenniumchangedon
January 1, 2000, there were great concerns that programs would fail. This was due in large part
to the early days of computing, in which storage was very expensive. Thus, any effort possible
wasmadetouseitefficiently.
Specifically, it was common practice to store all years in a two-digit format. “1965” was stored as
“65.” After all, it was clear that the first two digits would always be “19,” at least through the
careers of the programmers at that time. Let the roleover of the millennium be someone else’s
problem.Letsomeoneelse worrythat“05” –“98” was 7(2005–1998),not-93.Letsomeoneelse
worrythatabirthdateof“03”meant2003,not1903.
In the 1990s, the pressure to fix this problem mounted. Boards directed management to upgrade
the company’s systems for Y2K compliance. Auditors demanded tests. Regulatory agencies
established regulations with tough penalties. As a result, a lucrative short-term carriage industry
wasborn,whichpurportedtoprovideavarietyoftools toautomaticallyscanapplicationprograms
andfixthem.
But would the tools work? The ultimate arbiter was thorough testing of the modified programs.
However, testing required that a program be run and tested just as the date changed from 1999
to 2000. Clearly, testing couldn’t wait until that time. Applications had to be tested months in
advance.Butonecouldnoteasilychangethesystem timeandmakethesetests,evenduringoff-

Uses for Time Simulation
Therearetwoprimaryusesfortimesimulation–consolidationandtesting.
Consolidation
As systems grow more powerful, the ability to run several applications on a common server
becomes more attractive. This is the driving force behind today’s move to data-center
virtualization. HP NonStop systems have always provided virtualized environments that can
supportseveralprocessingenvironmentssimultaneously.
Consolidation of applications within a data center onto just a few servers is today a common
practice. Consolidation has now been extended to bringing applications from all over the world to
a common data center. Significant savings can be realized with respect to facilities, staff,
hardware,andsoftwarelicenses.
However, unless these applications were written to use GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), they
expect to run under their own local clock, not the clock of the consolidated data center. If several
oftheseapplicationsaretorunonasinglelargeserver,theprocessingenvironmentmustbeable
torespondtosystemtimecallswithinthetimezoneexpectedbytheapplication.
Consolidation is a powerful tool to reduce costs not only for production systems but for disaster-
recovery systems as well. A single hardened data center can act as a backup site for data
centersaroundtheworldifitsserverscanmorphintothelocaltimeofapplicationsthatfailoverto
it. If a single large server is backing up several remote data centers, it must be able to act as a
backupsimultaneouslytoapplicationsrunningindifferenttimezones.
OPTA2000 provides time-zone simulation that allows existing production and backup systems to
supportworld-wideconsolidatedenvironments.
Testing
Timesimulation is also useful for development, testing, and qualityassurance. Manyapplications
are time-sensitive. Examples include month-end and year-end processing and reporting, interest
accrual,feeassessment,paymentprocessing,andinventoryandreceivablesaging.
In order to develop, test and certify these applications, it is important to be able to change the
dates and times under which they are currently operating. Furthermore, any of these systems
might be used to develop or exercise many applications simultaneously, each with its own
date/time requirements. Therefore, it is important that the processing environment be able to
provideeachapplicationwithitsownclockandcalendar.
To satisfy this need, OPTA2000 provides clock simulation that allows development and testing
activitiestobecarriedoutinthesamesystemwithdifferentclocks.
Clocksimulationisdifferentfromtime-zonesimulation.RatherthanprovidinganoffsetfromGMT,
clock simulation provides a system time that is arbitrarilyoffset, typicallyin the future but in some
casesinthepast.
OPTA2000 Clock and Time-Zone Simulator
TANDsoft’s OPTA2000 Clock and Time-Zone Simulator provides time-zone and clock simulation
for NonStop servers. Using DLLs (dynamically linked libraries), it requires no application
modificationsandsupportsvirtuallyallNonStopenvironments.

Supported are user-developed applications, third-party applications such as Base24, and
NonStop utilities such as FUP and TACL. All NonStop programming languages are supported,
including Java, C++, C, COBOL, TAL, SQL/MP, and SQL/MX, among others. It is certified for
NonStop S-series, Itanium, and Blade servers. It supports all program types (100, 700, 800) and
runsundertheGuardianoperatingsystem.
DaylightSavingTimeTable(DST)
The OPTA2000 Time-Zone Simulator is driven by user-supplied Daylight Saving Time tables.
Each table represents time-zone information for a particular location. It includes the offset from
GMT for that location and the dates and times on which the location changes between Daylight
SavingTimeandstandardtime.
Because the DST parameters are specified by the user, there is great flexibility. For instance,
some countries (for example, China) do not observe Daylight Saving Time, Even worse, some
U.S. states (such as Arizona and Hawaii) and some portions of Canadian provinces
(SaskatchewanandBritishColumbia)remainonstandardtimeallyear.
GMT offsets must also be flexible. India’s time offset is GMT+5.5 (it is five and half hours ahead
ofGMT).Chinaspansfivetimezones,butthetimezoneforallofChinaisGMT+8.
ApplicationGroups
OPTA2000 provides its services on an application-group basis. The definition of an application
group is quite flexible. Using grouping and wild cards, an application group can consist of a
specified set of programs,a specified set of processes, a specified set of users,the descendants
of a common ancestor, a subvolume, and so on. If an application is not defined within an
applicationgroup,itisalwaysgiventhelocaldateandtime.
A system can host many application groups. For time-zone simulation, OPTA2000 determines
from its configuration information the time zone for an application group when that group makes
its first time call. It associates a particular DST table with that application group so that it knows
the GMT time offset to use. For instance, if the application is to run under UK standard time, the
offsetiszero.IfitistorununderNewYorkstandardtime,theoffsetis-5.IfitistorununderParis
standardtime,theoffsetis+1.
Furthermore, from the DST table, OPTA2000 knows when a transition between standard time
andDaylightSavingTimeistooccurandcanadjusttheoffsetappropriatelyatthattime.
Forclocksimulation,thedateandtimecanbesetintothefutureorintothepastforanapplication
group. The application group will then operate under that new date and time. For instance, if an
end-of-yearreportistobetested,thesimulatedclockmaybesettoDecember31st at11:45PM.
TheOPTA2000DLL
Via its DLLs,1 OPTA2000 accomplishes time simulation by intercepting system-time calls. No

Some Usage Examples
Timesimulation is actively being employed byscores of OPT2000 users around the world. Some
examplesfollow.
DisasterRecovery
A major global computer manufacturer has consolidated all of its disaster-recovery systems into
one data center in the U.S. Its backup systems are flexible and can be assigned dynamically to
take over the processing of one or more failed systems anywhere in the world. By using
OPTA2000’s time-zone simulation capabilities, the backup of afailed application can be given an
operating environment that has the same time zone as the failed application. In this way, only a
fewbackupsystemsareneededtoprotectmanysystemsdeployedworld-wide.
Consolidation
A major U.S. East Coast bank uses OPTA2000’s Time-Zone Simulation to run multiple NetBatch
environments in its central data center. Each NetBatch environment runs in its own simulated
time zone and is conscious of the GMT offset and standard time/Daylight Saving Time transition
schedules for its time zone. The NetBatch jobs are responsible for preparing market-closing
reports that must represent the local time with which the reports are associated. Though

NetBatch jobs are run in their respective remote time zones, system operators can monitor the
NetBatchjobschedulesaccordingtotheoperator’slocalclock.
Another bank, amajor Canadian bank, has consolidated its smallerWest Coastoperation into its
East Coast data center. By doing so, it has eliminated the costs of the separate data center, its
staff,andmuchhardwareandsoftware.Theconsolidatedsystemssupportback-officeandonline
banking applications that must be run in the application’s local time. OPTA2000 provides the
time-zone simulation to do this. Not only does OPTA2000 support the bank’s applications, but it
also supports third-party applications, including Base24 and Interac, the Inter-MemberNetwork
(IMN)debit-cardprocessingproduct.
Development,Testing,andQualityControl

Summary
The virtualization of time services is a powerful tool for consolidating backup resources for
disaster recovery as well as for data-center consolidation and time-sensitive test environments.
By providing a simulated time,TANDsoft’s OPTA2000 Time Simulator allows multiple processing
environmentstoberunonthesamesystemwhileusingdifferentclocks.
OPTA2000’s time-simulation capabilities can be used in two ways. They can provide virtual time
zones in which application groups can perform their processing. Alternatively, OPTA2000 can
provideavirtualdate/timeatanypointinthepastorfuturefordevelopmentandtestpurposes.
Withouttimesimulation,anapplicationmustrelyonthesystem clock;andallapplicationsrunning
on that system must use the same date and time. OPTA2000 breaks this barrier and allows
