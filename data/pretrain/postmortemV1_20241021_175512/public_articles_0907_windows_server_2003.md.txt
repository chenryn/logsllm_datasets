What Does This Mean?
Released almost ten years ago (Windows Server 2003 R2 was released in December, 2005), the
operating system has grown into a large number of sub-editions including Itanium and x64 editions, the
ComputeClusterEdition,theDatacenterEdition,theWebEdition,andtheEnterpriseEdition.Theend-of-
lifesupportappliestoallofthesesub-editions.
Phasing out Windows Server 2003 will be much more complicated than it is for XP. The mission-critical
applications beingrunbytheseservers cannotbetakendown duringthemigration,unlikeaWindows XP
PC. Many large customers are not even aware of how manyWindows Server 2003 applications they are
running.Manyoftheseapplicationsarenotpublic-facingandcannotbedetectedbyWebstatistics.
Once Windows Server 2003 reaches end-of-life, it will create a compliance nightmare. New security
issues will not be fixed (there are already a number of known vulnerabilities in Windows XP that will not
be corrected). As with Windows XP, it is anticipated that hackers will stockpile vulnerabilities that they
discover until after the Windows Server 2003 end-of-life date. At that time, the sudden flow of zero-day
exploits will present a serious security problem for Windows Server 2003 users, as these vulnerabilities
willnotbefixedbyMicrosoft.

Organizations using hosted services will have little choice but to upgrade. Service providers cannot
maintain Windows Server 2003 systems and continue to provide the support and security required by
their SLAs. Providers have no option but to force their Windows Server 2003 customers to upgrade their
applications.
Although some migration tools can aid the migration of some applications, most services still running on
Windows 2003 servers are fairly custom and will present unique, specific challenges during migration.

Therefore, a best practice to prepare for migration is to start with a thorough migration and upgrade plan
wellinadvanceoftheend-of-lifedate.
Options
There are several options available to upgrade from Windows Server 2003, though none of them maybe
palatabletomanyorganizations.
MovetoUnixorLinux
For most Windows Server 2003 applications, moving to Unix or Linux will mean rewriting them. This is a
riskyandexpensiveproposition.
MovetoWindowsServer2012
Windows Server 2012 will not run 16-bit Windows-based applications, and many early Windows Server
2003applicationswerewritteninthisformat.Even32-bitapplicationsmustberunwithanemulator.

Security can be improved by deploying Microsoft’s Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit 4.0 (EMET)

Microsoft will offer extended support for Windows Server 2003 systems for a fee. However, the cost of

HP/Microsoft Migration Services
HP and Microsoft are launching the HP Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Migration Program to help
customers migrate safelyand rapidlyoff ofWindows Server 2003 toWindows Server 2012. The resulting
applications will integrate better with Microsoft’s Azure cloud, which can be used as a backup. The
service will provide bundles engineered for specific Microsoft workloads. The program will also offer
speciallicensereplacementpromotions.

HP Financial Services is offering a $3 million program to upgrade 600 servers at $4,500 each and
includes an additional $300,000 in consulting services. This expense can be capitalized at $65,000 per
month,or2.2%ofthecost.
Summary
Now is the time to start planning and implementing the conversion from Windows Server 2003. Third-
party vendors should be contacted to ensure that they can port their applications off of Windows Server
2003.
The rewriting of old applications must be started now. This gives an organization the opportunity to
improveapplicationsecurityandstabilityandtoaddmuch-needednewfeatures.
