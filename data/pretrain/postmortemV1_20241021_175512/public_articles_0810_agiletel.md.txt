agileTel Runs Active/Active with Linux and MySQL
October2013
In a previous article,1 we looked at the paucity of active/active implementations in the
commodityserver world.We review in this article one such successful example of redundant,
geographically distributed systems using Linux servers and a MySQL database in an
active/activeconfiguration.
agileTel
agileTel (www.agiletel.com), a business unit of NetWeave Integrated Services, provides small to medium
businesses with a high performance, high qualityInternet VoIP (Voice over IP) virtual phone system that
provides the features of an enterprise phone service at no incremental cost. According to caller ID and
time of day, incoming phone calls can be routed to extensions, to mobile phones, or to an automated
attendant. Voicemails can be sent to users’ email inboxes, and users can listen to their messages via
their smartphones or computers. SMS text messages are sent to notify users that a voicemail has been
received.
Least-cost routing provides the lowest cost for outgoing calls. A web-based call-accounting interface
allows customers to track call usage. There is no on-site equipment except for the IP-based telephone
handsets.AnaloghandsetscanalsobeusedthroughAnalogTelephoneAdapters(ATA’s)..

agileTel operates two U.S. data centers, one on the West Coast in Los Angeles and one on the East
Coast in Secaucus, New Jersey. Providers such as Level3, Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint, route incoming
callsthroughthePSTN(PublicSwitchedTelephoneNetwork)tooneofthetwoagileTeldatacenters.The
data centers share the call load. It is the data center’s job to route the calls appropriately to the called
agileTelparties.
The data-center databases are kept synchronized via bidirectional replication so that any call can be
handled by either data center. Therefore, a provider may route a call to the data center of its choice.

AnagileTelDataCenter
The primary workhorse in an agileTel data center is a farm of Linux servers. They are responsible for
connecting incoming calls from providers, for placing outgoing calls to providers, for providing the
services available to the called parties, for maintaining the connections during the calls, and for
terminatingthecalls.
When a call request is first received at a data center from a provider, it is directed to a Session Border
Controller, or SBC. The SBC determines which server in the server farm should handle the call. This
selection is made according to server load (the most lightly loaded server is used) and on a round-robin
basis between servers handling the same load. If a server is unresponsive, the SBC will try another
server. Servers in the local server farm take precedence, but the SBC can also route calls to the servers
in the opposite data center. If the SBC cannot find an operational server, it will reject the call back to the

provider, who will try the other data center. The provider also tries the other data center if a problem
existswiththeSBC.
Each server has the rated capacity to handle 500 simultaneous calls. Currently, the data centers are
configuredwithfourtofiveserverseach,givingatotal callcapacityfortheagileTelsystem ofabout5,000
simultaneous calls. This capacity is easily expanded by adding servers. The database servers are
relatively lightly loaded in comparison to the server farm that manages calls. An active/passive database
serverpairisratedtohandleapproximately20serversintheserverfarm.
The SBC, call handling servers, and database servers are Dell rack-mounted servers running Linux. A
typicalservercomprisesfourfour-coreCPUs.
The servers have access to a redundant MySQL database configured as an active/backup pair. The
backup database is kept synchronized with the active database by MySQL data replication. Should the
active database fail, the backup database is put into service in just a few seconds. This active/passive
architecture uses the Linux-HA heartbeat system, with the active member publishing a virtual IP address.
In the event that the passive member detects loss of the primary(2 missed heartbeats), it will publish the
virtual IP address and take over primary database operations. When the former primary returns, the
former passive member will detect it and relinquish the virtual IP address to the primary. The servers in
the server farm are essentially unaware of these operations with the expectation that occasionally they
mayfindthattheyhavetoreconnecttothedatabasewhenthevirtualIPswitches.
Thedatabasestorestwoprimarysetsofdata:
 Rules governing the routing for each called number, such as the VM to which to route the call,
forwarding to a mobile phone, varying the endpoint according to the time of day, or routing to an
automated operator (i.e., “Press 7 for sales.”) The Rules Database is created and maintained by
agileTel personnel via administrative terminals. agileTel provides flat rate calling plans for all
domestic phone operations, so call rating is not a significant component as it only occurs for
internationalcalls.
 Call records written at the end of each call giving the details of the call (calling number, called
number,timeand date,duration, etc.) Call records are inserted intotheCallRecordDatabase by

The VM provides the PBX functions for the customer and controls the IP telephones at the customer’s
site. Typically, there is one VM per customer, though very small customer installations may share a
common VM and very large customers may have multiple VMs. Large customers have redundant VMs
that replicate configurations between them every few minutes. Smaller customers do not have redundant
VMs, but areplacement VMcan be configured in afew minutes.TheVMs use static IPaddresses,and a

Once the two parties have been connected, the SBC is released from the call and the conversation
proceeds. The conversational path comprises the provider, the selected server, the called party’s VM,
andthecalledparty’sIPphone.Analog-to-digitalconversionisaccomplishedbytheprovider.
CallDisconnect
Either end of the call can initiate the disconnect. The server and the SBC coordinate the disconnect in
either case to forward the hang-up signal to the opposite end of the call. The SBC will terminates the call
with the provider. The server terminates the call with the agileTel end-device via its VM and writes a call
record to the Call Record Database. The call record is replicated to the active database at the remote

Summary
There are three primary considerations when deciding whether to run a critical application as a
continuouslyavailableactive/activearchitecture:
1. Can the application be structured to run in a distributed environment with other active copies of
theapplication?
2. Isthereareliableandefficientbidirectionalreplicatoravailable?
3. Isthecostofgoingactive/activewarrantedbythecostofdowntime?
In agileTel’s case, the answer to all of these questions is a “yes.” The processing of each transaction (a
callrequest)is independentofallothertransactions,sothatrunningmultiplesuchtransactions inmultiple
sitesdoesnotcauseanyconflict.
The Tungsten Master-Master bidirectional replicator is an excellent MySQL data-replication engine.
Other third-partypackages suchas Shadowbase (www.gravic.com/shadowbase) andOracleGoldenGate
(www.oracle.com) support bidirectional replication between a varietyof databases, including Oracle, SQL
Server,MySQL,DB2,Sybase,andIngres.
