BlackBerry Gets Juiced
May2007
At about 5 pm Pacific Daylight Time on Tuesday, April 17, 2007, BlackBerry messages stopped
flowing across North America and elsewhere. Millions of BlackBerry subscribers were without
service until Wednesday morning, when queued-up emails from the huge backlog of messages
startedtotricklethrough.Itwasn’tuntilThursdaythatservicewasreturnedtonormal.
How did this happen to a service that has come to be depended upon by such a large group of
people?
The BlackBerry Success Story
BlackBerrys are handheld devices that are used to
sendandreceiveemailsalmostanywhereintheworld.
The BlackBerry service has been highly reliable and
has attracted bankers, lawyers, journalists, law
makers,andbusinesspeople.
The BlackBerry devices and their associated services
are provided by a Canadian company, Research in
MotionLimited(RIM),ofWaterloo,Ontario.
RIM is now in the process of going after the
mainstreamconsumermarketwithitsBlackBerryPearl
and BlackBerry 8800 devices, which add media players and mobile browsers to its email
capability.
This marketing effort has been more than successful. From a subscriber base of just two million
subscribers a little over a year ago, BlackBerrynow boasts a quadrupling of that subscriber base
to eight million subscribers; and it is currently signing up more than one million subscribers per
quarter.
The BlackBerry Network
The BlackBerry network comprises two Network Operations Centers (NOC), one in Canada
(Waterloo, Ontario) and the other in the UK. Each NOC acts as a hub, routing email messages
between the BlackBerry handheld devices and corporate email servers and email accounts such
asAOLandYahoo.

BlackBerry Enterprise Servers receive emails from the various email subscribers and route
encrypted emails to the appropriate NOC. The NOC authorizes users and forwards email
messagestotheappropriateBlackBerrys.

Likewise, messages received from the BlackBerrys are routed either to the destination email

To accomplish this, each NOC interfaces with multiple mobile networks to get near-worldwide
coverage.
The BlackBerry System Failure
On Tuesday, April 17, at 5 pm PDT, BlackBerry messages stopped flowing to subscribers in
North America.1 These subscribers could still make phone calls and send and receive emails, so
it was clear that the mobile carriers were not at fault. However, theycould not communicate over
BlackBerry no matter which cellular carrier they used. Since it was North American BlackBerry
subscribers that were affected, it was clear that the problem had to be in BlackBerry’s Canadian
NOC,whichservesNorthAmerica.
However, RIM management refused to acknowledge that they had a problem (though I suspect
thatthecomputerroomwasinmayhem).
It wasn’t until twelve hours later, on Wednesday morning, that RIM management acknowledged
that they had, in fact, had an outage. But they gave no reason for it and no prognosis of what to
expect.
ByWednesday morning, the system had been returned to service; but it had to deal with a huge
backlog of emails that had accumulated during the outage. These emails started to trickle out

Wednesday morning, but new emails that came in entered the end of the queue and were
delayedforhours.ItwasnotuntilThursdaythatoperationsreturnedtonormal.
Once operations normalized, RIM management began to release details of the outage. They
reported that the outage was triggered by the “introduction of a new noncritical system routine”
designedtooptimizecacheperformance.Theyhadnotexpectedthischangetoaffecttheregular

However, despite previous testing, the new system routine set off an unexpected chain reaction.
It triggered a series of interaction errors between the system’s operational database and cache

After the RIM technicians isolated the database problem and tried unsuccessfully to fix it, they
began the failover process to the backup system. But horrors of horrors, the failover attempt
failed,despitefailoverhavingbeenpreviouslytested.

The BlackBerry Public Relations Failure
The system failure was just one of the failures during this outage. The other was a near lack of
communication from RIM management to its subscribers. RIM’s tight-lipped response angered
many.GrumblescouldbeheardfromtheWhiteHousetotheCanadianParliament.
It took twelve hours to simply acknowledge that there had been an outage, and then there were

system had been returned to service that RIM management issued some details on the cause of
theoutage.
This has evidently been the practice of RIM management over the years. Though the BlackBerry
system is seen as a reliable system by its subscribers, it has had failures in the past. For

Lessons Learned
Among other lessons, there are two primary lessons to be taken from this incident: test and
communicate.

The other testing deficiency was proper failover testing. However, this is a common problem in
data centers. Failover testing can be verydisruptive and risky. During the failover process, which
could take hours, the system is unavailable to its users. Furthermore, often the system must be

Should the failover process fail during a failover test, service may be denied to users for even a

For these reasons, failover testing is often simply ignored, or failover is only partially tested. It is

Communications
Consumers have come to expect close communication with their utilities. Should power fail or
telephone service be interrupted, these utilities perhaps put as much effort into keeping
consumersinformedeitherdirectlyorthroughthemediaastheydoinfixingtheproblem.
Clearly, this is not a philosophy embraced by RIM management. With any service, the service
provider shouldlearntotrytofix theproblem whilesimultaneouslycommunicating withthemedia
andwiththeirusers–justaspowerandtelephoneutilitiesdo.
OtherObservations
AweaknessoftheBlackBerryservice,whichmayalsocontributetoitsstrengths,isthathalfofall
message traffic must pass through one node. Should that node fail, the service is out for those
subscribers.
Other email services do not pass emails through a central server. Companies can set up their
ownemailservicestosupportabroadrangeofPDAssuchasHP’siPaqandPalm’sTreo.
Still, as active/backup pairs, the BlackBerry NOCs should have extreme availability. But so far,
theycan probably claim a little less than three 9s. Testing is one of their fundamental challenges
toachievebetteravailability.
It is hard not to notice that RIM is operating two NOCs. If only these were architected to be an
active/active pair, outages such as this could be eliminated. Software bugs and failover faults

Onapositivenote,eventhoughthis was oneof those famous “CNN Moments,” itis interestingto
note that RIM’s stock price was not battered. It held fairly steady during the crisis and recovered
quickly after an initial drop. All in all, this must be an indication of what people really think of
