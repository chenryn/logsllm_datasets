Summary: Multiple Cloud products experiencing elevated error rates,
latencies or service unavailability in europe-west2

Description: A cooling related failure in one of our buildings that
hosts zone europe-west2-a for region europe-west2 is impacting multiple
Cloud services.

Cooling system restoration in europe-west2-a has been completed.

GCP product teams are working on restoring their services. ETA to be
determined.

We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.

**Product Impact:**

**Cloud Filestore:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: A small number of customers in europe-west2-a may
    be experiencing service unavailability. No new issues are expected
    for customers with working instances.
-   Workaround: Customers are advised to fail over to another region, if
    possible.

**MemoryStore for Redis:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers will experience timeouts for management
    API (create, update, delete, etc.), and cache flushes.
-   Workaround: None at this time.

**MemoryStore for Memcached**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Existing instances in europe-west2-a may be
    unavailable. Additionally, customers may experience degraded
    performance in europe-west2. Instance creation is not affected.
-   Workaround: None at this time.

**GKE:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Certain portions of clusters with presence in
    europe-west2-a may be unavailable.
-   Workaround: Customers are encouraged to move their workloads to
    other regions if possible.

**Bigtable:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Service unavailability and elevated latency for
    some customers in europe-west2.
-   Workaround: Workloads using replicated databases with replicas in
    europe-west2, may be moved to the region close to the other replicas
    to reduce latency.

**Cloud Dataproc:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Dataproc cluster creation and scale up may
    experience elevated error rate in europe-west2-a.
-   Workaround: Customers can choose a europe-west2-b, europe-west2-c or
    other regions.

**Datastream:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Datastream Streams in that region might experience
    errors and lags which eventually could lead to lost position
-   Workaround: Customers are advised to run their Streams in another
    region.

**Cloud SQL:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: 4 zonal instances are still impacted. Most non-HA
    instances backed by europe-west2-a are working again in
    europe-west2-a. And most HA instances in europe-west2 are
    operational again as of 19:00 US/Pacific.
-   Workaround: None at this time.

**Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers will be unable to perform any operations
    on Managed Active Directory (AD) domains which are single region
    (europe-west2). Customers will also experience a degraded experience
    if one domain controller is unavailable due to zonal impact.
-   Workaround: None at this time.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/19/22 22:15 US/Pacific

**Cloud Data Fusion:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis : Service unavailability in europe-west2 for a very
    few customers.
-   Workaround: None at this time.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/19/22 21:30 US/Pacific

**Google Cloud Storage:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers with data in the impacted region may
    have seen elevated errors when attempting to read objects.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/19/22 08:53 US/Pacific

**Google BigQuery:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Datasets were unavailable for the impacted
    locations.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/19/22 13:43 US/Pacific

**Google App Engine and Cloud Functions:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers may have experienced high error rates
    for Google App Engine and Cloud Functions in europe-west2 for
    requests coming through Cloud Pubsub, Eventarc, Cloud Tasks, and
    Cloud Scheduler. Pubsub, Eventarc, and Cloud Tasks traffic will be
    automatically retried once the outage is resolved. Cloud Scheduler
    requests will need to be resubmitted.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/19/22 11:05 US/Pacific

**Dataflow:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Dataflow Streaming jobs already running in the
    impacted area may have been stuck. New Dataflow jobs may not start.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/19/22 12:38 US/Pacific

**Cloud Composer:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: All operations experienced downgraded performance
    in europe-west2.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/19/22 22:30 US/Pacific

**Persistent Disk (PD):**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: All PDs should be healthy and back online
-   Workaround: Create PD devices in a different region/zone.
-   Impact Mitigation time: From 11:18 US/Pacific, customers should be
    able to create new PD devices in europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c.
    From 07/20/22 04:18 US/Pacific all PDs should be healthy and back
    online.

**API Gateway:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers may have experienced elevated 5xx errors
    in europe-west2.
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/19/22 10:07 US/Pacific

**Cloud Spanner**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Most Cloud Spanner customers will not see any
    impact, but customers should stay below our recommended CPU usage
    65% for Single Region or 45% for Multi Region to not experience any
    increased latency.
    <https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/cpu-utilization#recommended-max>.
    Multi Region clients running in europe-west2 will see added latency.
-   Workaround: For eur5 customers can choose to route to europe-west1,
    no workarounds needed for europe-west2
-   Impact Mitigation time: 07/19/22 17:00 US/Pacific

**Looker:**

-   Impact/Diagnosis: Customers hosted in europe-west2 will experience
    significantly increased failed requests.
-   Workaround: None at this time.
