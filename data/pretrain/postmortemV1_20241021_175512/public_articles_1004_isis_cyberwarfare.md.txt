ISIS Turns to Cyber Warfare
April2015
ISIS has opened a new front in its attacks against the west – cyber warfare. It has
managed to hack thousands of web sites and social media to post threatening
messages,includingthesocialmediaoftheUS.CentralCommand.Itevenwasabletotakedowneleven
FrenchTVstationsforalmost24hours.
Many of the hacked systems were thought to be exceptionally secure. This indicates that ISIS has
developedaverysophisticatedandeffectivehackingcapability.
TV5Monde Losses Eleven TV Channels
TV5Mondeis aFrench-languageglobal television network (“monde” is Frenchfor “world”).It is oneof the
top three television networks around the world, along with CNN and MTV. It broadcasts eleven channels
and offers round-the-clock French entertainment, news, and culture programming that reaches 260
millionhomesworldwide
On Wednesday, April 8, 2015, at 10 PM Paris time (4 PM EST), all
eleven channels of TV5Monde went dark. Well, not quite. They showed
the logo of ISIS, the so-called militant Islamic State. By Thursday
morning, TV5Monde could broadcast only prerecorded programs. Full
service was not restored until about 6 PM on Thursday, April 9th, almost
a day later. Various computerized internal administrative and support
systemsincludinge-mailwerealsoshutdownduetotheattack.

TV5Monde stated that they had extremely powerful and certified firewalls. It is assumed that the hack
occurred through social engineering, in which people are tricked into installing malicious programs or
givingupsensitiveinformationsuchasusernamesorpasswords.
Other ISIS Hacks
On January 15, 2015, shortly after the Charlie Hedbo and
kosher supermarket attacks that killed seventeen people,
ISIS hacked into the Twitter and YouTube accounts of the
U.S. Central Command. The Central Command oversees
the American-led war against ISIS and has been
spearheading the hundreds of air strikes against ISIS
targets in Iraq and Syria. Its Twitter account has 113,000
followers. ISIS replaced the Central Command’s Twitter
banner with ablack andwhitebanner showingan imageof
ahoodedmilitant.

ISIS also posted a warning message on the Central Command’s Facebook page saying, “American
soldiers,wearecoming.Watchyourback.ISIS.
Anotherpostedmessagesaid:
“In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the CyperCaliphate continues its
CyberJihad.AmericanSoldiers,wearecoming.Watchyourbacks.”
Additional posts listed the purported names and addresses of American military personnel, including
somefour-stargenerals.

Later that month, the home pages of an estimated 19,000 French websites of businesses, religious
groups, universities, and municipalities were replaced with an image of the ISIS logo and the message
“TheIslamicStateStayInohallah.FreePalenstine.DeathtoFrance.DeathtoCharlie.”
Summary
To add to its aggression in Iraq, Syria, and other areas, ISIS is attempting to spread its influence through
the Internet. So far this year, it has managed to carry out an impressive number of sophisticated attacks.
We can only assume that these attacks will continue as it appears that ISIS has created an impressive
