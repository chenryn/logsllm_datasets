Windows Azure Cloud Succumbs to Leap Year
March2012
ShadesofY2K!Microsoft’sWindowsAzureCloudwentdownforoveradayonWednesday,February29,
2012. Starting around midnight as the clock ticked to Leap Day, various subsystems of the Azure Cloud
started to fail one-by-one. Soon, applications for many customers became unresponsive. By 8 AM
Thursday morning, thirty-two hours later, Microsoft reported that recovery efforts were complete but that
"asmallnumberofcustomers…mayfacelongdelaysduringservicemanagementoperations."

Windows Azure
Windows Azure is Microsoft’s Platform as a Service cloud-computing platform. Azure became
commercially available in February, 2010, and is currently supported by six Microsoft service centers
worldwide.AzureRegionsinclude:
 NorthAmerica
o North-CentralUS(Chicago,IL)
o South-CentralUS(SanAntonio,TX)
 Europe
o WestEurope(Amsterdam,Netherlands)
o NorthEurope(Dublin,Ireland)
 Asia
o EastAsia(HongKong,China)
o SoutheastAsia(Singapore)
OntheAzurewebsite(www.windowsazure.com),MicrosoftdescribesWindowsAzureasfollows:
“Windows Azure delivers a 99.95% monthly SLA and enables you to build and run highly available
applications without focusing on the infrastructure. It provides automatic OS and service patching,

The Failure Timeline
The following is the failure timeline as reported by ZDNet,1 complied in part from the Azure dashboard

10:55AMGMT
Microsoft began reporting problems on its Service Status dashboard with Windows Azure Compute
across North America. “Incoming traffic may not go through for a subset of hosted services in this sub-
region.” It assured customers that applications would continue to run and that there would be no impact
onstorage.
12:36PMGMT
The Service Status dashboard became intermittently unavailable. Customers were in the dark as to what
washappeningorastoanyprojectionsofreturntoservice.
2:20PMGMT
Microsoft claimed that the Service Management issue had been “mitigated” and that service had been
restored to the majorityof its customers.However, “We still need to work through some issues before we
can completelyrestore service management services.” Microsoft said that it is in the process of “verifying
themostprobablecause”oftheoutage.

Microsoft was trying to restore Azure Compute service in the North Europe and U.S. regions. It reported

“Due to attempting to restore Compute functionality in the North Central US, South Central US and

The Leap Year Fiasco
Microsofthas notbeenveryforthcomingas to whatcausedthis massiveoutage. However,clues abound;
and the general consensus is that the outage was due to one of the most embarrassing bugs a
programmercanmake:AzuredidnothandletheFebruary29thLeapDaycorrectly.
Clue#1:TheoutageoccurredjustafterthestartofLeapDay,GMTtime.
Clue #2: Though customers noted that their Azure applications continued to run, they could not be
reached.Theywouldnotevenrespondtopings.
Clue #3: Microsoft said the Azure service management problems were caused by “a cert issue triggered
on 2/29/2012.″
Clue#4:Microsoft’sleadAzureengineer,BillLaing,CorporateVicePresident,ServerandCloudDivision,
notedinhisblogpostthat“Whilefinalrootcauseanalysisisinprogress,thisissueappearstobeduetoa
timecalculationthatwasincorrectfortheleapyear.”
These clues lead to the conjecture that the outages resulted from a date-related glitch in SSL (Secure
Sockets Layer) certificates. These certificates are used by systems to authenticate each other. Without
validcertificates,thesystemsareunabletocommunicate.

All SSL certificates include the date the credential was issued and the date it expires. Before an
application accepts a certificate as valid, it computes the current time to make sure it falls inside that
range. Many administrators prefer that their certificates remain valid for relatively short periods of time,
sometimesforonlyoneortwoyears.
If the Azure certificates relied on years consisting of only 365 days rather than the 366 days required
everyfour yearsforleapyear,thecloudplatformmayhaveshutdownassystemswereunabletoconfirm
that they were connected to other trusted nodes. This would explain why applications that were, in fact,
runningintheAzurecloudcouldnotbereached,evenwithasimpleping.
Summary
ItistroublingthataftertheY2Khysteria,weshouldbeexperiencingonceagainacalendar-relatedfailure.
A raft of date-simulation products were developed back then to allow systems to simulate dates without
changing thesystem clock,therebyallowing the Y2K transition to be tested while thesystem remained in
production.Manyoftheseproductsarestillaroundtoday.IftheAzurecloudhad beentestedfortheleap-
year problem to the extent that most systems were checked for the Y2K problem, Microsoft may have
avoidedthisdisaster.
On the other hand, perhaps the problem was preordained. On the Azure web site quoted earlier,
Microsoft stated that Azure provides “resiliency to hardware failure.” There is no mention of software
failure.
