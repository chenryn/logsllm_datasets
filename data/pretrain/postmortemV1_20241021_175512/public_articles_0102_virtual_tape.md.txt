Virtual Tape – Getting Rid of a Troublesome Medium
November2006
Magnetic tapehas beenthebackupmedium ofchoicefordecades.Accompanyingit,however,is
a lot of baggage. In large shops, there can be a floor-full of magnetic tape units and myriad
operators. Tapes must be moved to off-site storage and then retrieved in the event of a system
failure or data loss. Perhaps magnetic tape’s most serious limitation is the hours, days, or weeks
thatitmaytaketorestoreafailedsystemortobringupacoldbackup.
Arecentsolutiontotheseproblemsisvirtualtape.Avirtualtapesystem virtualizesmagnetictape
cartridges as disk files. Virtual tape cartridges are fast and space-efficient. They may be
electronically replicated to off-site storage and to backup sites. Their contents can be written to

The HP Virtual Tape Server
One virtual tape product is HP’s Virtual Tape Server for NonStop systems. It looks exactly like a

The HP VTS is fault-tolerant and scalable. It can reduce restore times by 50% at a cost

Backup
Typically in a data center, the database is protected by periodically writing a full snapshot of the
database to magnetic tape. This is a very lengthy procedure, typically requiring that the system

To minimize the loss of data in the event of a fault, incremental backups are made on a more
frequentbasis –perhaps daily.Intheevent of asystem failure,thesystem (or its backup) canbe
restored by loading the last full backup onto the system from magnetic tape and then by rolling it
forward with the incremental backups. All data since the last backup is lost. This defines the

Enter Virtual Tape
Virtual tapesolves or minimizes manyof the problems associated withmagnetic tape. It basically
replaces magnetic tape with disk files that are virtual representations of tape cartridges in a way
thatistotallytransparenttothehostsystem.
Virtual tape servers replace the magnetic tape controllers and present the identical interface to
the host system. These servers create virtual tape cartridges, virtual tape drives, and virtual tape
libraries on highly reliable disk systems. Disk storage systems are typically either RAID arrays or

Backup
Withvirtual tape, allbackupoperations aretotallyautomatic andrequirenooperator intervention.
Basically, a file which would have been written to magnetic tape is now written to virtual tape
instead. The VTS system manages all cartridge labeling, retention management, and all of the
otherjobsdonebyoperatorswhenmagnetictapewasused.

andincrementalbackupstoreduceRPO.
There are no on-site tape drives required (though in some cases, a few may be desirable).
Rather, the backup files can be transmitted directly to the off-site storage facility, bypassing the
needtotransferanyphysicalmagnetictapes.
In addition, backup files can be transmitted directly to the backup site if there is one and will be
immediatelyavailableatthatsiteintheeventofafailureoftheprimarysite.
It’sAllAboutRestoreTime

Virtualtapemakesmanyimprovementsinrestoretime:
 There is no need to retrieve tapes from an off-site facility. The backup data is already at
thesitetoberestored.
 Restorationfromdiskcanbemuchfasterthanrestorationfromtape.
 Tape reading errors are eliminated. (Disk storage is redundant so that in the unlikely
eventofadiskreaderror,thedatacanberecovered.)
 Operatorerrorsareeliminatedsincesystemrestorationisautomatic.
 If a backup site is used, backup can be started and monitored remotely before staff has
arrivedatthebackupsite.
As a result of these time savings, field experience has shown that restore times can be reduced
by 50% or more. Days may become hours. Thus, the organization’s RTO can be reduced by a
similaramount.
InstantDR
HP’s Virtual Tape Server has two important modes of operation directed at different problems –
InstantDRandAutoCopy.
Instant DR (Instant Disaster Recovery) is aimed at backing up non-transactional databases.
Whenever abackupfileis closed,thebackupdatais replicatedtothebackupsites (local,remote
backup,and/oroff-sitestorage).
More importantly, replication is done in a very efficient manner since only the change data is
replicated. Typically, the amount of data that has changed in a file between backups is only a
smallproportionofthefile’ssize.Therefore,replicatingjustthechangesmaydecreasereplication
timebyordersofmagnitude.
Furthermore, incremental backups are not just simply stored to be used in a restore operation
later. Rather,theyareappliedimmediatelytothe latest copyof thebackupfilesothattherestore
process onlyrequires that the latest backup copyof the database be loaded. There is no need to
apply incremental backups. The change data is retained so that previous backups can be
recreatedasnecessary.
A major advantage of Instant DR is the restoration of lost or corrupted files. With tape, the last
backup must be read for its version of the file; and then all of the incremental backups must be
searched for updates to that file. This can take hours.With virtual tape, direct access is available
to the latest backup of that file. Restoration time is now measured in minutes or seconds rather
thanhours.
AutoCopy
AutoCopy is used to back up transactional data. This includes full backups and audit trails.
Whenever a backup file or an audit trail is closed, AutoCopy will replicate it to the appropriate
sites.
VTSPolicyFacility
HP’s VTSPolicy facility allows the specification of replication policies. It can be used to direct

OtherCharacteristics
OtherfeaturesoftheHPVTSincludethefollowing:
 Performance: Backup and restore performance is greatly enhanced relative to magnetic
tape because disk transfers can often be faster, efficient compression is used, and there
isnoneedtodealwithoff-sitetransfers,losttapes,tapeerrors,oroperatorerrors.
 Compression: HP’s VTS uses compression to send and to store its data. Compression
ratiosof3:1arecommon.
 Scalability:TheHPVTScanscalefromtwoVirtualTapeServerstooveronehundred.
 Availability: By using at least two Virtual Tape Servers and highly reliable disk systems,
anextremelyavailablebackupsubsystemisobtained.
 Encryption: Data can be encrypted during transit and during disk storage. Gone are the
days when unencrypted tapes were lost during transit to or from the off-site storage site.
(Citibank oncelostfour millionnonencryptedcustomer records;Bank of Americalostone

GallagherBasset
Gallagher Basset is the largest multiline property and casualty third-party administrator. Over a
period of time, its backup operations moved from reel-to-reel to cartridges to virtual tape.
Formerly, it had a library of 7,000 to 8,000 tapes and fought constant operator errors. The
companywasgettingsignificantpressureonitsbackupwindow.Restorationtookmanyhours.
When it moved to virtual tape, backup time was reduced by 50%; and the tape library was
reducedto60tapes.
SunGardSecuritiesFinance
SunGard is a major Application Service Provider (ASP) to the securities lending community. It
wasperformingseveralnightlybackupsandusedover ahundredcartridges eachnight.SunGard
went to multiple virtual tape servers and RAID disk systems. It used GFS (Global File System) to
ensurethatallvirtualtapeservershadaccesstoalldataevenintheeventofafailure.
This move reduced its backup and restore windows by up to 75%. Virtual tape eliminated
operator and media errors. SunGard’s backup and restore procedures are now completely
