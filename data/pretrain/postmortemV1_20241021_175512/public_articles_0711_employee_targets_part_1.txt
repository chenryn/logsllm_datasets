FBI Warns Employees Are New Targets
November2012
A recent joint report issued by several government agencies1 concerned with cybersecurity has warned
that individual employees at financial institutions are being more frequently targeted by cybercriminals.
Prepared by the FBI (the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation), FS-ISAC2 (the Financial Services –
Information Sharingand Access Center), and IC3(the InternetCrimeComplaint Center),the report notes
that cybercriminals are using a variety of malware to obtain employees’ login credentials. The stolen
credentials were used, for instance, to initiate unauthorized wire transfers ranging up to USD one-million
dollars.
The increased attacks on “soft” targets are not limited to financial institutions. They are being launched
against a variety of organizations that are not generally viewed as being obvious targets.
The 2011 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR),3 published byVerizon and the United States Secret
Service,4suggeststworeasonsforthischangeinattackdemographics:
 The success of law enforcement is the stick that is motivating cybercriminals to look for softer, less
riskytargets.
 The emergence of off-the-shelf powerful malware is the carrot that is making the effort of attacking

FS-ISAC, as a service to its members, sponsors weekly seminars on a variety of threats to financial
institutions. A recent webinar focused on the FBI report. Presented by Dana Tamir, Director of Product
Marketing for Trusteer, a major provider of endpoint cybercrime prevention tools, the webinar provides

 Application compromise, in which an
application is corrupted to cause harm to
an organization. Perhaps the biggest
example of this is the June, 2010, Stuxnet
virus which aimed to destroy Iran’s

 Data stealing, in which massive amounts
of confidential individual information is
stolen from a hacked database. An
example of this type of attack is the theft
of the information of 100,000,000 Sony

In its warning about employees becoming the targets of cybercriminals, the joint FBI/FS-ISAC/IC3 report
focused on the increased activity to spy on individuals that are using system endpoints such as PCs and
laptops.
Endpoint Attack Methodology
Cybercriminals are using advanced malware to infect the endpoint devices of organizations to steal the
credentials of employees. They are infecting the endpoints with Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and
variants of the Zeus malware. Remote Access Trojans (named after the classical Trojan horse) provide a
backdoor for hackers to take control of the endpoint computer. Via the backdoor, the hacker can monitor
the user’s keystrokes (key-stroke logging), can see his screens (screen capture), can include the device
inabotnet,orcandovirtuallyanyotherfunctionthattheusercanperform.
Zeus is a Trojan horse like RAT that can be downloaded by botnets comprising millions of computers.

These Trojans typically use phishing emails and corrupted web sites to infect endpoint computers. If a
useropensaninfectedfile senttohim byemailor accessesitonaphishingweb site,theTrojanhidingin
theemailorwebsitewillinstallitselfontheuser’scomputer,thusinfectingit.
Once installed, the malware uses key logging and screen capture to monitor the user’s activities and to
steal his credentials and other confidential information such as bank account numbers and credit card
numbers. Armed with this information, the cybercriminal can withdraw funds from the user’s account,
initiate wiretransfers,and usethe victim’s creditcard or debitcard.In addition,if thehacker obtains login
information to other systems used by the user, he can access those systems and extend his criminal
activities.
Why are cybercriminals moving into these types of attacks? They are easier and safer. Corporations are
putting a lot of effort into protecting their IT systems from cyberattacks. As the Verizon DBIR report

referenced earlier concluded, the success of law enforcement at tracking down major attacks coupled
with the availability of off-the-shelf sophisticated malware is encouraging cybercriminals to look for softer
targets.
Cybercriminals want to get around the securitycontrols and get into a backdoor where theycan focus on
individual employees who are not the center of attention from a security viewpoint. There is less
monitoring of employee activities than there is of major IT functions like database access. Endpoint
attacksarebecomingthepreferredchanneltoperpetratefinancialfraud.
Some Troubling Statistics
Mandiant (www.mandiant.com) is an incident response firm that does forensic analyses of attacks and
works with their customers to create a remediation plan to mitigate its effects. They publish several
reportsontheirfindings.Amongthesearethefollowingstatistics:
 54% of endpoint devices that were involved in an attack had been infected with malware and
contributedtotheattack.(Theremainingattacksinvolvedinfectionsofthesystemsthemselves.)
 77% of the malware that is found on endpoint devices is commercial off-the-shelf malware easily
available from public web sites for small fees (as the Verizon DBIR pointed out). Most endpoint
attacks do not use sophisticated infections comprising malware that has been specially designed
forthepurpose.
 94% of breaches are never discovered by the infected organization. They are reported to the
organizationbythirdparties,oftendays,weeks,ormonthslater.
 100% of breaches involving stolen credentials were made against endpoint devices that had up-
to-dateantivirussoftware.
The fact that organizations are unable to detect infections in their endpoint devices even with antivirus
software is particularly troubling and makes endpoint attacks very effective. If days, weeks, or months
elapsebeforecompaniesareawareofanattack,itistoolate.
Though antivirus software does an excellent job at preventing known threats, it is defenseless against
zero-day attacks – those that occur before the virus has been identified. By the time that the virus is
identified and included in the antivirus software, the endpoint device has already been infected and
remainsso.
Case Studies
Someexamples of actual infections of endpoint devices are illustrative of the problems that organizations
facewithendpointdeviceinfections.
 Hackers targeted a South African Postbank teller and stole his Postbank login credentials as well
as those for several other systems. They then managed to transfer USD $6.7 million into their
accounts.Itisassumedthatthetellerfellvictimtoascamemail.
 An attack was launched against an international airline carrying thirty million passengers
annually. A variant of the Zeus Trojan was used to steal the VPN credentials of an airline
employee to log into the system. The attack used a combination of form grabbing and screen
capture to obtain the credentials. To control the intrusion, the airline had to close down its VPN

 A Zeus variant targeted the Ceridian cloud-based payroll service. It stole employees’ ids,
passwords, company numbers, and the image-based secret authentication icons used to ensure
employeesthattheyhadaccessedtheCeridianwebsiteandnotanimposterwebsite.Toprotect
against such attacks, Ceridian used a virtual keyboard that was accessed with mouse clicks so
that there were no key strokes to intercept. But the malware used screen capture to detect the
mouse clicks and to steal the information. The malware used in this attack was off-the-shelf

 A RAT is commercially available online to target hotels. It steals the credit card numbers of
