Twitter Taken Down by DDoS Attack
August2009
On Thursday, August 6, 2009, the Twitter social networking site went down. It suffered repeated
outages,timeouts,andseriousslowdownsforatleasttwodays.Whatcausedthisfailure?
To add to the mystery, Facebook and LiveJournal simultaneously had similar problems. Were
these outages somehow related? They occurred at about the same time as the 2009 Defcon 17
hackers conference held from July 30th to August 2nd. Could this have been some misguided
mischief?
But first, what is Twitter? For those who haven’t yet become addicted, Twitter is a microblogging
socialnetworkingsitethat allows users tocommunicatewhattheyaredoingtotheir “followers” at
any time via 140-character text messages, or “tweets.” Twitter was born in 2006 and has
exploded in use. It currently has about five-million registered users, and an estimated 45 million
peoplefollowtheseusersviatheirtweets.
Twitter sprung into the mainstream when Republican presidential candidate John McCain joined
the 21st century technology by embracing tweeting following the 2008 U.S. presidential election.
Even more recently, and perhaps more importantly, Twitter was the primary communication
mechanism to the rest of the world from those Iranians participating in the major rallies decrying
the recent Iranian presidential election process. The untimely death of Michael Jackson also saw

The Twitter Outage
AccesstoTwitterLost
Twitter has not been known for its availability record. Pingdom, a web-site monitoring service,1
reports that Twitter was down for 84 hours in 2008, achieving only a 99% uptime.2 It should be
noted, however, that Twitter is working hard to improve this record; and its uptime improved
significantlyinthesecondhalfof2008.
All that progress was threatened at 9 AM EDT on Thursday, August 6, when Twitter suddenly
became unavailable to those trying to use it. During that day and much of the next, Twitter was
down for a few hours, would seem to recover but would be sluggish or subject to timeouts, and
then would go down again. Continuous periods of outages and timeouts continued well into the
nextday.WasthisjustanotherTwitteroutage?

It didn’t take long for Twitter to conclude that no, this was not just another outage. Rather, it
seemed to be a target of a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) in which its servers were
being swamped by spam messages. At 9:43 AM, EDT, on its service-status blog, Twitter staff
said that “We are determining the cause and will provide an update shortly.” It did not take them
long to verify the cause. At 10:49, they added “We are defending against a denial-of-service
attack,andwillupdatestatusagainshortly.”
IsThisReallyaBigDeal?
The outcry over the Twitter outage showed just how far Twitter has come as a source of
information for millions of people. But did this outage have any serious consequences? After all,
isn’t Twitter just a social network used for communicating between friends and following the
antics of the well-known? Isn’t it a waste of employees’ time in a corporate environment? The
Marines have banned all social networking among its troops for the next year. The NFL has
bannedTwitter.
However, the answer to the above questions is “not any more.” In just a short time, the
importance of Twitter has grown far beyond that of simply social networking. It has established
itself as a crucial platform for information exchange in the face of global events where more
traditional means of broadcasting have been inaccessible or blocked, as shown by the recent
events in Iran. Furthermore, many companies are discovering the value of Twitter in their public
relations, marketing and sales efforts. They find that Twitter allows them to engage with
customersinrealtime.
CompaniesarenowexperimentingwithTwitterintwoways:
 Outbound messaging – Companies are posting tweets about corporate
accomplishments, new product announcements, and other information to their followers.
AT&T uses Twitter to communicate network outages to their ISPs. Many power
companies areusingtweets toinform their customersaboutthe status of power outages.
Airlines are advertising cheap fares good for just a few hours on undersold flights. Even
the SEC, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has three Twitter accounts –
onefornews,oneforinvestorrelations,andoneforemploymentopportunities.
 Inbound messaging – Companies are using the Twitter search feature to track tweets
concerning them. Many tweeters have been quite surprised when complaint tweets that
they have just sent to their friends suddenly get a response from the company offering
help. Companies taking advantage of this source of real-time customer satisfaction
information include Comcast, Dell, GM, H&R Block, Kodak, Whole Foods Market, Jet
Blue,SouthwestAirlines,andUnitedAirlines.
Though social networking certainly is not yet mission-critical, Gartner Group’s July 2008 report
added microblogging to its list of technologies that will transform business over the next two to
fiveyears.

24 hours later, Facebook and LiveJournal were back to normal operation; but Twitter was still in
trouble. Working together, the staff of these social networks discovered that they were all the

The Detective Work
WhatisaDenialofServiceAttack?
ADDoSattack occurs whenawebsiteis overloadedbyamassivevolumeof unwantedtraffic.In
trying to respond to this traffic, it cannot respond to its normal traffic; and its web servers may
evencrash.
DDoS attacks are launched by a zombie army controlled by a single master. Prior to the attack,
usingsecurityflawsinunprotectedmachines,themasterinstallsmalwareontensofthousandsof
PCs worldwide. This army of zombies is called a “botnet.” The botnet is simply waiting for
instructionsfromitsmaster.
At some point, the master gives instructions to its zombie army to carry out some coordinated
task. In the case of a DDoS attack, this task is to send messages carrying some particular
content to one or more web sites. These web sites are now under attack and, unless protected,
will suffer severe performance problems or crashes. Because of the distributed nature of the
attack,itisextremelydifficulttotracetheattackbacktothemaster.
DDoS attacks have been carried out for years. However, they did not garner much attention until
one week in the year 2000, Yahoo!, CNN, Amazon, and eBay were all taken down by a DDoS
attack launched by a Canadian teenager who wanted to make a hacker name for himself. DDoS

TheClue
It didn’t take but a few hours for the social networks, working in concert, to determine the reason
for the assault. The spam messages were all queries against the blog of a single user who went
bytheusernameCyxymu.Clearly,someonewasouttosilenceCyxymu.Butwhy?
Cyxymu
It turns out that Cyxymu is a pro-Georgian blogger, a 34-year old economics lecturer from Tbilisi,
Georgia, who had been criticizing Russia’s conduct in its war a year ago over the disputed South
Ossetiaregion.CyxymuisthenameofatownintheformerSovietUnion.
Cyxymu had accounts with Twitter, Facebook, LiveJournal, Google’s Blogger, and YouTube.
Upon further investigation, Google and YouTube were also targeted but were substantially
unaffected. LiveJournal blocked access to Cyxymu’s account in order to recover from the attack.
Facebook,thoughexperiencingslowdowns,managedtokeepCyxymu’saccountavailable.
In later posts, Cyxymu blamed Russia for the attack. He suggested that the timing of the attack
was meant to silence him on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the Russian attack on
Georgia.
Max Kelly, chief security officer at Facebook, is quoted as saying that “It was a simultaneous
attack acrossanumber ofproperties targetinghim [Cyxymu]tokeephis voicefrom beingheard.”
However, Mr. Kelly declined to speculate on whether Russian nationalists were behind the
attack.3

Protecting Against DDoS Attacks
Howcanyouprotectyourwebsitefromsuchattacks?Itseemsthattherearetwostrategies:
 Have enough capacityto withstand such an attack.This can be accomplished by hosting
your web site on the cloud. Many hosting services have tremendous data centers and
through virtualization can provide additional capacity on demand to meet peek needs –
even those dictated by a DDoS attack. You might pay more for the temporary additional
capacityneeded,butyouwon’tgodown.
 Detectthedifferencebetweenlegitimatetrafficandspam,anddirectthespam toavirtual
garbage bin – a black hole. Like a pathogen, a disease-producing agent in the animal
body, nefarious traffic is known as “pathological network traffic.” This traffic can often be
detectedbyitsrepetitiveness.
Productsareavailabletoprotectagainstpathologicalnetworktraffic.CiscomarketsitsDistributed
Denial of Service Protection Solution4 to ISPs. This product allows the ISPs to deliver “clean
pipes” to their customers. The product distinguishes between legitimate traffic and pathological
trafficandfiltersoutthelatter.
For the end user, Prolexic Technologies (www.prolexic.com) offers a service that will provide
essentially the same function. Its DDoS mitigation service will filter out pathological traffic

Lessons Learned
Launching a DDoS attack today is almost trivial for a qualified hacker. Such attacks occur
frequently. Sites havebeen shutdownfor ransom,especiallyoffshoregamblingsites that are not
high on the priority list of law enforcement agencies. Financial institutions and online stores have
been shut down by such attacks and their traffic redirected through a DNS (Domain Name
Server)securityflaw5tofraudulentwebsitesinordertoharvestcreditcardnumbers.
Abotnetcan berentedfor about10 cents to40cents per PC.For $4,000, anefarious antagonist
can launch a sustained attack against your web site from 10,000 PCs; and you’ll probably never
beabletotrackdowntheperpetrator.
No matter how big you are, you should worry about the possibility that someday you may be the
target of a DDoS attack.Take precautions today to protect yourself. Twitter has probablylearned
that lesson the hard way. Two years ago, it had a miserable availability record and has put a
major effort into solving that problem. This was such an extensive effort that protection against a
