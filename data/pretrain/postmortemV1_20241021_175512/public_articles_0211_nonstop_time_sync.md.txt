Time Synchronization for NonStop Servers
November2007
In our companion article, Time Synchronization for Distributed Systems – Part 1 (November,
2007, Availability Digest), we described the Network Time Protocol (NTP) so ubiquitous on the
Internet for maintaining time synchronization between nodes in a distributed system and a civil
time reference source. NTP is an open source facility that is available on a wide variety of
platforms, including Windows, Unix, and Linux. SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol) is a
stripped-downversionofNTPthatsupportsclientsinteractingwithasingletimeserver.
Unfortunately, there is not an NTP open source port available for HP NonStop servers. Rather,
these services are provided by proprietary products that are compatible with NTP running on
othersystems.Inthisarticle,wereviewtwooftheseproducts.OneisfromBowdenSystems,and
theotherisfromHP.
NSK-NTP and NSK-SNTP from Bowden Systems
Bowden Systems, Inc., offers both NTP and SNTP products for NonStop S-series and Integrity
systems.
NSK-NTP
NSK-NTPisafullimplementationofNTPasfoundonUnixsystems.ItisfullycompliantwithNTP
version 3 and is compatible with NTP versions 1 and 2. It complies fully with RFC 1305, the
specificationforNTPversion3.1ItrunsunderHP’sGuardian90operatingsystem.
NSK-NTP supports all NTP configurations, including symmetric active/passive (peer-to-peer),
client/server, and broadcast/multicast. A broadcast/multicast client can discover remote servers,
compute server-client propagation delay correction factors, and configure itself automatically. An
NTP client can synchronize to multiple time sources and maintain an accuracy of 10 to 40
milliseconds.
The period for polling a time server is variable. It starts at about one minute and lengthens over
time to whatever poll time is necessary to maintain clock accuracy, up to a maximum of
seventeenminutes.
If the client clock offset is less than seventeen minutes, NSK-NTP will slew the clock by 128
msec. every poll period until the clock has been properly adjusted. If the offset is greater than
seventeenminutes,NSK-NTPwillabort;andthetimemustbemanuallyreset.

Bowden Systems claims that SNK-NTP can be installed in less than 30 minutes. It can be
configuredforautomaticstartupandrestart.
NSK-SNTP
NSK-SNTP is a client implementation of NTP version 3, and it retains compatibility with NTP
versions1and2.ItrunsunderHP’sGuardian90operatingsystem.
NSK-SNTP supports one time source and typically delivers accuracies in the order of 100 to 500
milliseconds.
It uses a fixed poll interval that can range from 10 to 60 seconds, depending upon the clock
accuracydesired;anditcanhandleuptoaneight-minuteclockoffseterroronstartup.
NSK-SNTPoffersnosecurity.

PrimaryReferenceClocks
Both NSK-NTP and NSK-SNTP can synchronize with other NTP time servers, or they can
synchronize directly with primary reference clocks. Both products have been tested by Bowden
with a variety of primary reference clocks, such as those from Symmetricom
(www.symmetricom.com). Symmetricom has a line of reference clocks that include both cesium
atomicclocksandGPSreceivers.
Pricing
As of this writing, the license fee for either NSK-NTP or NSK-SNTP is $7,000 for NonStop S-
seriessystemsand$8,000forNonStopIntegritysystems.
BowdenSystems
Bowden Systems is located in Norcross, Georgia, USA. The company was founded in 1991 and
hasbeenanHPpartnersince1992.
NonStop Time Synchronization from HP
NonStop Time Synchronization from HP (www.hp.com/go/nonstop). synchronizes clocks among
NonStop servers and between NonStop servers, Windows systems, Linux systems, and NTP or
SNTP time sources. It is fully compatible with NTP or SNTP open source facilities running on
LinuxandWindowssystems.ItcanuseeitherNTPorSNTPtimeserversasareferencetime.
HP NonStop Time Synchronization is not an open source offering. It is a proprietary product that
iscompatiblewithbothNTPandSNTP,andincludesfullsupportfromHP.
The HP NonStop Time Synchronization product was created to fill two separate but related
objectives:
 tosynchronizeclockswithinadistributednetworkofcomputers,and
 tosynchronizetheseclockswiththereal-worldciviltime.
It can be used to achieve either goal independently or to achieve both goals. That is, it can be

 HP NonStop Time Synchronization, which provides clock synchronization services for
NonStopservers.
 HP NonStop Time Synchronization – Linux Edition, which provides clock synchronization

 HP NonStop Time Synchronization – Windows Edition, which provides clock

NonStopServers
HP NonStop Time Synchronization can be deployed on NonStop S-series servers and on
NonStop Integrity servers. On these servers, it can run either under Guardian or under the Open
SystemServices(OSS)operatingsystems.
HP NonStop Time Synchronization can operate across NonStop Expand networks or NonStop
clusters. It can also operate with NonStop servers in hybrid networks comprising Linux and
Windowssystems.
A NonStop server can operate either as an NTP or SNTP client, or it can be a NonStop Time
Synchronization server. The product supports NTP and SNTP time sources as well as NonStop
TimeSynchronizationservers.
This product replaces earlier NonStop time synchronization products, including SNTP Lite, which

HPNonStopTimeSynchronization integrates withthe native event managementsystem oneach
platformtoprovideloggingofcriticalevents.
A command interpreter is provided to dynamically alter the configuration and to obtain status
information.
Clock readings from multiple sources can be averaged according to NTP algorithms to provide
moreaccurateclockadjustments.
A report-only mode is provided. It reports time differences without actually making clock
adjustments.
Summary
There is no open source port of NTP or SNTP available today for NonStop servers. However,
there are available proprietary products for NonStop servers that are completely compatible with
NTPandSNTPversion3.
