The Value of Availability
June2011
In an earlier issue, we reviewed Blueprints for High Availability: Designing Resilient Distributed
Systems, a classic book on high availability.1 The authors, Evan Marcus and Hal Stern, have
since published a second edition.2 Their new book focuses less on cluster technology (their core
experience)andextendsitselftothebroaderissuesofhighavailability.
Wewill not review the entire book in this article. Rather, we pass on the authors’ insights into the
financial justification for highly available systems as presented in Chapter 3, The Value of
Availability.
What is High Availability?
Unfortunately, there is no commonly accepted definition for the term “high availability.” System
vendors have molded the term to suit their own purposes. Almost every system in the
marketplacetodaytoutsitshigh-availabilityvirtues.
The problem lies with both terms – “high” and “availability.” Just how is availability defined? Does
it mean that the system hardware and software are up and running? Does it mean that the users
are able to use the system for its intended purpose? Is the system available if only a subset of
usersisdown?
The term high is equally ambiguous. Does it mean that the system will never fail? Does it mean
that the system is down for only seconds or minutes following a system fault? Does it mean that
the system is down for only seconds or minutes a year? Does it mean that the system is
operationalonlywhenitisneeded?
The authors suggest that a system can be considered highly available if it is available enough of
the time to generate the return for which it was implemented in the first place. High availability
requires that a system be protected against all possible events. But the accurate prediction of
these events is impossible. Therefore, high availability is considered a design goal. It should be
clear to the system designers what the availability requirements for the system are. If the system
isdesignedtomeetthoserequirements,itcanbeconsideredtobehighlyavailable.
Theauthorsproposeadefinitionthatseemstomeetwithreality:
“High availability is a level of system availability implied by a design that is expected to

In other words, it is a business decision; and it is a matter of expectation rather than of future
experience.
The Costs of Downtime
Therearetwocategoriesofdowntimecost–directandindirect.
DirectCosts
Directcosts arethosethat canbemeasuredbythebeancounters inthecompanyor its auditors.
Theyinclude:
 Lost user productivity. This includes not only the time lost (and paid for) because the
system users are sitting around with nothing to do but also the cost of overtime as users
recoverthelostwork.
 Opportunity losses. An opportunity loss is the loss of a chance to do something
regardless of the outcome. Such losses can be lost sales experienced by a retailer, lost
commissions on trades suffered by a brokerage firm, or fraudulent credit-card activity if
transactionscannotbeverified.
 Regulatory and litigation costs. These costs include regulatory fines due to violating
governmental regulations as well as the results of legal actions by third parties seeking
compensationforlossesduetoasystemoutage.3
Various industry analysts have made passes at quantifying direct costs of downtime for various
industries.Theauthorsreportthefollowingfindings:
AverageDowntimeCostperHour(U.S.dollars)
Brokerage $6.5million Financial $1.5million Chemicals $704,000
Energy $2.8million Manufacturing $1.6million Healthcare $636,000
Creditcard $2.6million Retail $1.1million Media $340,000
Telecom $2.0million Pharmaceutical $1.0million Airlines $90,000

Though these numbers are average across the industry and do not reflect the costs of any one
company,theyclearlyshowthatthefinancialcostofdowntimecanbesignificant.
IndirectCosts
Indirect costs are harder to quantify but can have a greater impact and can extend over a longer
periodoftime.Examplesofindirectcostsare:
 Customer satisfaction. If acustomer cannot immediatelyplace an order for an item, he is
likelytogoelsewhere.Hemayormaynotreturnasarepeatcustomer.
 Bad publicity. The press loves to report bad news. Furthermore, it focuses on

 Stock prices. A common consequence of bad press is a run on a company’s stock,
devaluing it and reducing the company’s market capitalization. This can reverberate
throughout the company, reaching the company’s C-level executives and the board of
directors.
 Legal liability. Those financially impacted by an outage can take legal action for
remuneration.Insomecases,topexecutivescanbeheldliableforgrossnegligence.
 Employeemorale. Badpress,astock drop,and legal actioncancausekeyemployees to

 Externalreputation. If the wordgets outthatkeyemployees are leaving,thereputationof
the companycan be damaged. This can lead to a vicious cycle of worsening fortunes for
thecompany.
Is High Availability Worth It?
Downtime costs money. Protecting against downtime costs money. How much downtime
protectioniswarranted?
It is difficult to evaluate the tradeoff for the indirect costs of downtime. This must be a
management evaluation. However, determining the balance between direct costs of downtime
andthecostofavailabilitycanbequantified.
Simply put, given a risk, there is a downtime cost associated with that risk over the life of the
system. The cost savings to the company is the difference between the risk cost without
availabilityandtheriskcostwithavailability:
risk=downtimecostoverthelifeofthesystem
costsavings=(riskwithoutavailability)–(riskwithavailability)
Thereturnofaninvestmentinhighavailability,itsROI,is
ROI=(costsavings)/(costofavailability)
For instance, if an availabilitysolution costing $100,000results in asavings of $300,000, the ROI
is $300,000 / $100,00 = 3.0, or 200%.4 If the cost of downtime is $50,000 per year, the
investmentwillbereturnedintwoyears($100,000/$50.000).

Risk=10x2x1x$10,000=$200,000
A complexity not considered above is that the cost of downtime may not be constant. A brief
outage of a minute or so may not have any cost impact. An outage of an hour may have a
measureableimpact.Anoutageofadaymayhaveasignificantimpact.Anoutageofaweekmay
put the company out of business. An outage at 1 AM may have a lesser cost impact than an
outage at noontime. An outage in August may have a lesser cost impact than an outage just
before the Christmas holidays. The cost of downtime has to be some justifiable (and hopefully
conservative)averageoverallofthedowntimepossibilities.
An Example
The authors give an illuminating example, which is summarized here. A company that is
considering expanding its single system into a two-node clustered system with a lifetime of five
years. The company’s cost of downtime is $75 per minute, or $4,500 per hour. The company’s
costofmovingtohighavailabilityisestimatedasfollows:
Secondserver $42,000

Thus, the risk without availability is 9,360 minutes. The risk with availability is 416.5 minutes. At
$75 per minute, the risk cost without availability over the lifetime of the system is $702,000. The
risk cost with availability is $31,238. The savings in downtime costs provided by the high

What If You Don’t Know the Cost of Downtime?
Thecostofdowntimeisnotalwayspossibletoreliablyestimate.Inthiscase,adifferentapproach
can be taken if the downtime minutes with and without availability can be estimated, as in the
previous table. The trick is to use the above equations to calculate the amount of downtime that
will result in zero cost savings, given a particular availability solution. A business decision can
thenbemadeastowhetherthisisareasonablesolution.
Fromtheaboveanalysis,thetotalcostsavingsgivenaparticularapplicationis
totalcostsavings=(downtimesavings)x(downtimecost)-(availabilitycost)
where
downtimesavings=(downtimewithoutavailability)-(downtimewithavailability)
Note that downtime savings is expressed in time and that total cost savings is expressed in
currency.
Wewanttofindthedowntimecostthatwillyieldzerototalcostsavings:
0=(downtimesavings)x(downtimecost)-(availabilitycost)
downtimecost=(availabilitycost)/(downtimesavings)
This equation gives us the downtime cost at which we will realize no savings. It we think that our
downtime cost is greater than this, the availability solution should be considered further. If we
thinkthatourdowntimecostislessthanthis,weshouldproceednofurther.
Inourpreviousexample,thedowntimecostthatproduceszerosavingsis
downtimecost=$105,160/[(9,360–416.5)minutes]=$11.76/minute
or $706 per hour. In all likelihood, our example company would have considered this a good
investmentwithoutknowingexactlywhatitsdowntimecostwas.
Summary
High availability is a business decision. Whether to adopt a particular high-availability solution
depends upon many factors. From a cost viewpoint, it is a comparison between the cost of the
solution and the cost of the downtime that it will save. Factored into this must be other
considerations with respect to indirect costs, such as customer satisfaction and company
reputation.
In this article, we have summarized the techniques put forth byMarcus and Stern to evaluate the
financialsavingsandreturnoninvestmentthatanavailabilitysolutionmightbringtoacompany.
