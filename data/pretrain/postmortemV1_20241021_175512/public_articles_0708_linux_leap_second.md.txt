Linux Leap-Second Bug Takes Down Data Centers
August2012
What a difference a second can make. At the stroke of midnight the evening of Saturday, June 30, 2012,
servers all over the world began to crash. Was this another Stuxnet virus1 propagated by some rogue
governmenttotakedowntheworld’sITinfrastructure?
No. The crash was caused by a leap second, which is added every few years to keep the world’s clocks
in synchronism with the earth’s rotation. A bug in thousands of unpatched versions of Linux choked on
this.Theseservershadtoberebooted,causinghoursofdowntimeatsomeoftheInternet’smostpopular

The Leap Second
Universal CoordinatedTime,or UTC,is the measureof timedefined byhighlypreciseatomic clocks.Our
senseoftimeisgovernedbytheearth’srotationandisrepresentedbyGreenwichMeanTime(GMT).But
the earth’s rotational speed wobbles due to many factors. This variance is monitored by the International
EarthRotationandReferenceSystemService.
To account for this variation, leap seconds were introduced in 1972. Every year or two, a leap second is
addedtoorsubtractedfromourGMTclockstoresynchronizetheworld’sclockswiththeearth’srotational
position. So far, 25 leap seconds have been added to our clocks. Leap seconds are typically issued at
midnightonJanuary1storJune30th.
To keep computing systems in time synchronization, the Internet utility NTP (Network Time Protocol)2 is
used. NTP broadcasts the correct time over the Internet and uses complex algorithms to account for
Internet communication-latency differences. When a leap second occurs, NTP automatically adjusts its
timetoaccountfortheleapsecond.

The Linux Bug
Developers had previously found that a software bug in the Linux operating-system
kernel prevented it from properly handling leap-second adjustments broadcast by NTP.
This bug was corrected in a March, 2012, patch; but many system administrators had
notinstalledthepatchbythetimeJune30thcamearound.

ThebugresidedinLinux’s high-resolutiontimers(hrtimer).Thislogicfailedtoresetthesystem timewhen
a leap second was encountered via NTP. Therefore, the hrtimer time, which is driven by NTP, was one
secondaheadofthesystemtimefollowingtheoccurrenceofaleapsecond.
The problem occurred when an application running in an unpatched version of Linux called for a kernel
timeoutof less than onesecond.TheLinux high-resolutiontimer sawthatthetimealreadyhadexpired(it
thoughtthetimewas onesecondlater thanthesystem time) andreturnedtothe program immediately. In
theeventofatimeout,manyapplicationssimplyrepeatthetimeoutrequest,creatinganendlessloopand
causing100%CPUutilization.
System administrators found that rebooting the application typically did not resolve the issue (the timing
error was at the kernel level, not the application level). Therefore, they finally resorted to rebooting their
servers. Rebooting corrected the problem, as the kernel resynchronized its time on reboot; but rebooting
tookanhourormore,duringwhichtimetheapplicationsweredown.
Had the system administrators known, all they would have had to do was to resynchronize the system
clock.Thiswouldhavecuredtheproblem immediately. Butthetruesourceoftheproblem was notknown
bymanyuntilmuchlater.
The Consequences
Manypopular Internet sites were affected, including LinkedIn, Mozilla, and Reddit. The Amadeus’ ALTEA
airline hosting system that manyairlines such as Qantas and Virgin Australia use for passenger check-in
and ground services was down for almost an hour. In some data centers, hundreds of servers had to be
rebooted.
Initial conjecture was that the problem was in Java, as most affected applications were written in Java.
Especially affected were the Hadoop database manager and the Cassandra database. It was only later
thatthebugwasisolatedtotheLinuxkernel.
Interestingly, another consequence of the bug in large data centers was a sudden spike in power
utilizationwhenagoodnumberofserversstartedtorunatfullload.
GooglewasoneInternetcompanythatdidnothavetheproblem.Ithadprepareditssystemsforjustsuch
an occasion via a technique it calls “leap smear.” Prior to the arrival of a leap second,
Google slowly adds a few milliseconds at a time to its system clocks so that its systems are already in
synchronismwhentheleapsecondisappliedbyNTP.
The Bug Fix
Developerscontinuetowork onfixesfortheleapsecondproblem.InadditiontotheirMarch,2012,patch,
they have incorporated fixes into Linux release 3.5 and have retrofitted these fixes into Linux versions
3.0.38,3.2.24,and3.4.6.
Summary
Surprisingly, just one month later, at midnight on July 31st, manyservers again went down due to a leap-
secondaddition.However, inthis case,the leapsecond was bogus. Itappears thatthis was somesortof

It was just afew months agothat wereportedon aLeapDaybugthat took down Microsoft’s Azurecloud
services for a day and a half.3 It looks like time adjustments for leap events should be approached with
greatcautionbysystemadministrators.
The bottom line: keep up with your patches. But never patch all of your systems at the same time. Try a
new patch for a few days in a small number of select servers. Otherwise, you may be subject to the
McAfee syndrome,4 which caused millions of PC systems worldwide to lock up because of a faulty
upgradetoMcAfee’santivirusproduct.
