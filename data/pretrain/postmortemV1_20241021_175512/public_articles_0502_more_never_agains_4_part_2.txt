BanditGameServersTakeDownMuchofChina’sInternetServices
PC World, August 28, 2009 – China is rife with private servers used to illicitly run copies of
popular games for profit. The operators of these servers have a history of launching distributed
denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks on each other. However, in one case in May of 2009, an
operator went too far. He launched a DDOS on a DNS (Domain Name Server) that provided
URL-to-IP address conversions for several competitors. Unfortunately, this was a major DNS
server in China’s network. As it became overloaded, it sent excess DNS requests to other
servers,whichoverloaded.MuchofChina’sInternetservicewasdownforhours.
MaintenanceDisruptsCaliforniaAirspace
PR Newswire, August 28, 2009 – A maintenance subcontractor’s mistake shut down the FAA
Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) in the Oakland Air Traffic Control center, affecting flights
in Northern California, Nevada, and the Pacific Ocean. Controllers had to rely on cell phones to
coordinate flights with neighboring FAA facilities. It seems that a maintenance error created
problems with the communication system. The backup system was put into service but failed the
next day, causing the outage. The controllers were never notified that they were running with a

Commerce Bank and advertised the new TD Bank as “America’s Most Convenient Bank.” But
when it tried to integrate the back-office processing of the two banks, “convenient” became

processing failed, leaving customers with access only to day-old data and no online services.

SinglePointofFailureCausesVerizonOutage
Computerworld, October 5, 2009 – A stalled Verizon router interrupted DSL and fiber Internet
service to much of New York and Massachusetts for an hour or more on October 5. Though the
router was part of a redundant network, it failed in such a way that it appeared to be operable to
neighboring routers. Therefore, other routers continued to send traffic to it, which the stalled
router simply dropped. Likewise, the backup router thought that the stalled router was still
operational and did not take over. Ultimately, the offending router was rebooted; and service was
restored.

The Register, October 19, 2009 – SwissDisk of Las Vegas, Nevada, provides online storage
services. In mid-October, it suffered a “catastrophic hardware failure” that prevented users from

the system was restored to service. SwissDisk announced that it was taking steps to provide

Washington,DC,TransitSystemImpactedbyNon-RedundantPowerFailure
Washington Post, November 5, 2009 – The Metro is the transit system for Washington, DC. Its
operational headquarters in downtown Washington depends upon two 27-year old power
distribution systems, neither of which has a backup. One distribution system powers computers
that operate the rail system. The other powers about a dozen vital communications systems,
including two-way communication with bus drivers, the subway public address system, the bus
vehicle locator, and fare card machines. On Thursday, November 5, the latter power distribution
system reached its end-of-life. It took a half day to restore service with a temporary fix, but the
