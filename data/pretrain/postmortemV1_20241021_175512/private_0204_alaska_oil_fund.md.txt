The Alaska Permanent Fund and the $38 Billion Keystroke

An employee of the Alaska Department of Revenue perhaps should have thought twice before
acting. While maintaining a system that distributed oil revenues to Alaskans, he made that one
fatefulkeystrokewhichtotallywipedoutanaccountworth$38billion–anditsbackup!
The Alaska Permanent Fund
Shortly after oil from Alaska’s North Slope began flowing through the Trans-Alaskan pipeline,
huge revenues started flowing into the coffers of the state of Alaska. And just as quickly, this
money flowed out of its coffers into the favorite projects of state politicians. Over $900 million
disappearedfromoilrevenuesinthefirstyear.
Toprotectoilrevenues for thecitizens of thestate,a stateconstitutionalamendment was passed
in 1976. It set up the Alaska Permanent Fund to receive and invest proceeds from the sale of
Alaskan minerals. In 1980, the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation was established to manage
theassetsoftheAlaskaPermanentFundandotherstatefunds.1

 to keep the oil revenues out of the hands of politicians, who could be counted on to

The fund since then has paid a yearly dividend to all Alaskan residents. The dividends are
managed by the Permanent Fund Dividend Division of the Alaska Department of Revenue. Over

The Fat Finger
OnafatefuldayinJuly,2006,acomputertechnicianworkingonadiskdriveattheDepartmentof
Revenue mistakenly deleted the oil fund database, including all of the currently outstanding
applicant information.2 This was not a big problem because the data also existed on a redundant
backup disk. However, under the pressure of the moment, the technician also managed to
reformatthebackupdisk.
Not to despair. Like all good data centers, this data was backed up on magnetic tape. The only
datathatwouldbelostwouldbethosetransactionsenteredsincethelastupdate.
The tapes were retrieved from storage. Only then did the magnitude of the disaster become
apparent. The tapes were unreadable. The triple redundancy that was built into the system was
not enough. Each level of redundancy had failed. 800,000 scanned images representing

The Painful Recovery
Over the next several days, employees of the Permanent Fund Dividend Division and the
Department of Revenue, along with consultants from Microsoft and Dell, tried vainly to salvage
the data. The terrible truth finally had to be accepted. The last nine months of transaction history
hadbeen lost.This included800,000scannedimages of paper applications mailedin or filledout

control,writtentothedatabase,andlinkedtotheappropriateperson’saccount.
It took 70 people working nights and weekends almost two months to complete the recovery, but
complete it they did. To their credit, the majority of the dividend checks went out on time in
October and November, including dividends to 28,000 new applicants that had not been
previouslyprocessed.

VirtualTape
Magnetic tape backup has always suffered from several characteristics that make it somewhat
unreliable. It must be transported to a backup site to ensure its availability following a disaster
that takes out the site. It must be retrieved from the backup site, a procedure that could take
hours or days. Once retrieved, tapes can be unreadable and totally useless for backup. This is
whatbroughtthePermanentFundtoitsknees.
Today, virtual tape is a commercial reality.3 With virtual tape, backups are made to redundant
disk systems (typicallyRAID) rather thantotape.Thevirtualtapesystem canberemotefrom the
processing site to provide a degree of disaster tolerance. Tapes can be spun off of the virtual
tape systems if needed for regulatory or other purposes. Furthermore, virtual tape provides a

MaintenanceProcedures
To allow an online disk to be reformatted or to have its data deleted is just plain folly. Proper
protections should be in placetopreventa disk from being wiped out unless it is firstdemounted.
In this case, if the technician had demounted the disk that he intended to work on, verified that
the system was still running properly on the remaining disk, and then did whatever he was going
to do, he would not have destroyed both disks. If he had successfully deleted the data from one
disk and then had mistakenly tried to reformat the other, the request would have been denied;

OperatorProcedures
“Whenthingsgowrong,peoplegetstupider”–WendyBartlett,HP.
As soon as the technician realized that he had mistakenly erased the first disk, you have to
believe that his stress level skyrocketed. This was no time for him to continue critical
maintenance. The proper procedure would have been for him to immediately stop work and call
for a cohort to work with him to make sure that there would be no further operator errors. This
shouldbeacommonpracticeinalldatacenters.
TestYourBackupProcedures
Backup procedures that haven’t been thoroughly tested are not backup procedures at all. They

Not only should backup procedures be tested, they should be tested regularly. Configurations
change.Personnelchange.Procedureschange.
This is especially true of tape backup procedures. Tapes themselves should be periodically
tested to make sure that they are useful. For really critical data, it is not a bad idea to create two
backup tape copies and to store them at separate sites. $38 billion seems to be worth that extra
precaution.

Postscript
The recovery effort cost the state $200,000 - $128,000 for employees and $72,000 for
consultants. But at least it was successful. The Department of Revenue is planning to ask the
state legislature to pay this from the Permanent Fund revenues. This could mean a reduction of
37centsinthenextdividendchecks.Itcouldhavebeenalotworse.
The data center now has proven and regularly tested backup procedures that are much more
robust.
Management was especially understanding about the situation. Not a head rolled. Former
Revenue Commissioner Bill Corbus said, “Everybody felt very bad about it, and we all learned a
lesson.Therewasnowitchhunt.”
