BlackBerry – OMG, It’s Déjà Vu!
January2010
BlackBerrys have become a perceived necessity for anyone on the move – bankers, lawyers,
managers,journalists,lawmakers(evenPresidentObamahasone),andanyoneelse“onthego.”
Consequently, one would think that RIM (Research in Motion) would consider its BlackBerry
services mission-critical at this point. If it did, it would be striving to achieve high-availability if not
continuousavailabilityforitsemailandInternetaccessservices.Butoverthepastfiveyears,RIM
has achieved about three 9s of availability – down for hours per year. You could do as well with

Interestingly, RIM’s problems have had a common
thread– upgrades.Over thepastthree years,RIM
has sufferedfivemajor outages lastinghours each

– particularly the BlackBerry Messenger (BBM)
and BlackBerry Internet Services (BIS). These
outages affected BlackBerry’s Internet browsing
andemailservices.

At about 5 PM Pacific Time, on Tuesday, April 17, 2007, millions of BlackBerry users discovered
thattheywere withoutmessagingservices.1TheoutagelasteduntilWednesdaymorning,but the
backlog of messages that had accumulated overnight took until Thursday to clear before service
was returned to normal. This was a 24- to 48-hour outage depending upon whether you are
measuringsystem downtimeor user downtime(we define availabilityas service availabilityto the
enduser,makingthisa48-houroutage).
RIM management did not even acknowledge that it had a problem until Wednesday morning.

noncritical system routine” designed to optimize cache performance. Since when is messing
around with cache noncritical? The change triggered a series of errors between the system’s
database and cache, resulting in a temporary outage until the local backup could be brought
online.
But guess what? The failover failed. It took two days to bring the system up and clear out the
backlogof messages.RIM operates two Network OperatingCenters (NOCs), one inCanada and
oneintheUK.Unfortunately,theyarenotconfiguredtobackeachotherup.
RIM’s CEO, Jim Balsillie, took to the airwaves to assure BlackBerry subscribers that this would
neverhappenagain.Hesaid:
"It was a process error that we had that’s been fixed. It shouldn’t have happened, and it
won’thappenagain.”
Friday, September 7, 2007
But it did. Around 10 AM on Friday, September 7, 2007, BlackBerry messaging services failed
again. RIM made no statement about this outage except that it said “Research in Motion is
continuingtomonitorthesituationandapologizestocustomersforanyinconvenience.”
Slowdowns persisted into Friday night as message backlogs were cleared. RIM never made a
statementastothecauseoftheoutage(infact,itbarelyacknowledgedthattherehadevenbeen
anoutage).
Monday, February 11, 2008
At 3:30 PM Eastern Time, RIM’s email and Internet services disappeared.2 Half of all North
American subscribers – about four million subscribers – suddenly found their email screens
empty.
This time, RIM was more forthcoming. It sent out a message that began with “This is an
emergency notification regarding the current BlackBerry infrastructure outage.” The message
went on to list the effects of the outage. Unfortunately, this message was sent to BlackBerry
subscribersbyemail.Theyreceivedithourslaterafteremailserviceshadbeenrestored.
This outage was caused by an upgrade to RIM’s routing system. For redundancy purposes, RIM
provides to its North American NOC two IP networks. RIM clients are split between these paths.

Subsequently,RIMissuedastatement:
“The upgrade was part of RIM’s routine ongoing efforts to increase overall capacity for

Thursday, December 17, 2009
On or about December 14, 2009, RIM issued an upgrade, 5.0.0.55, to its BlackBerry Messenger
instant messaging service and encouraged all subscribers to download it. A few days later, on
Thursday,December17,atabout3AMEasternTime,theupgradecausedBlackBerrytosuffera
major outage that took down email, Internet browsing, and instant messaging across North and
South America. Embarrassingly, this occurred just before RIM was scheduled to release its third-
quarterresults.
Itagain was hours beforetheoutage was restored
and the email backlog cleared up. To correct the
problems caused by the .55 upgrade, RIM
released a new upgrade a few days later –
5.0.0.56, – and directed its subscribers to
downloadthisupgrade.
Tuesday, December 22, 2009
Tuesday, December 22, 2009, was a busy day for
email. Christmas was just three days away, and
airlines had their hands full with holiday travelers
beingdelayedbysevereweatherconditions.
What a bad time to find out that the 5.0.0.56 upgrade didn’t correct the problem. Users in North
and South America again found that they had no email service. Even users in the Asia/Pacific
region (China, South Korea, Australia, Taiwan, India, and Singapore) reported problems. To
compoundmatters,there was nomessageon RIM’s homepage,nodetails concerning what was
going on, andnoexplanationof what happened on December 17.Subscribers weresimplyleftin
thedark.
RIMimmediatelyissuedupgrade version5.0.0.57, whichfortunatelyseems tohavecorrectedthe
problem.However,ittookfromTuesdaytolateThursday(ChristmasEve)beforeemailwasfreely
flowing again. RIM then issued an explanation of sorts indicating that this pair of outages likely
stemmedfromaflawedBlackBerryMessengerupgrade:
“Root cause is currently under review, but based on preliminary analysis, it currently
appears that the issue stemmed from a flaw in two recently released versions of
BlackBerry Messenger (version 5.0.0.55 and 5.0.0.56) that caused an unanticipated
database issue within the BlackBerry infrastructure. RIM has taken corrective action to
restoreservice.”
The Cost of Outages
Many BlackBerry subscribers are losing patience with RIM. A common theme of frustration was
postedbyoneangrysubscriberonBlackBerry’ssupportsite:
“Terrible. This is [the] second consecutive upgrade that was FUBAR'd for me for my
Storm. Unless I get a fix quicklyI'm going with the Droid, and that will end mypatronage
ofRIM.TherearetimesIlovethisphone,andtimesIjustwanttothrowitagainstawall.”
The BlackBerry smartphone is currently the number two seller in the world, second only to
Nokia’s ESeries. In the U.S., it is number one, with 20% of the market. The Apple iPhone is
number two, with 11% of the market; but the iPhone is rapidly gaining on the BlackBerry
smartphone.

BlackBerry faces stiff competition not only from the iPhone, but also from several other
competitors such as Palm’s new Pre, Motorola’s Droid, Google’s forthcoming Nexus One, and
Verizon/Microsoft’s Sidekick (though Sidekick recently suffered a perhaps-fatal blow when it lost
all of its subscribers’ data3). As users rely more and more on smartphones as all-in-one
communicationdevicesforvoice,email,texting,andInternetaccess,outageswon’twinfans.
RIM is currently in a strong competitive position. It showed a 59% increase in profits in the third
quarter of 2009, during which it sold ten million phones. However, with Apple and Google
breathing hard down its back with excellent availability histories (though AT&T is having trouble
handlingthevolumecreatedbytheiPhones),thisstrongpositioncouldrapidlydisappear.
Wetalk often about the cost of downtime in terms of dollars, safety, stock value, and publicity. In
RIM’scase,itsoutagehistorycouldrelegateittoan“alsoran.”
Lessons Learned
Upgrades
Based on our many Never Again stories, power outages and network outages seem to lead the
list of reasons that systems go down. RIM is not following this pattern. Their Achilles’ heel is
upgrades:
April17,2007–cacheupgrade
February11,2008–routingupgrade
December17,2009–BlackBerryMessengerupgrade
December22,2009–BlackBerryMessengerupgrade
Therearetwofundamentalrulesforsuccessfulupgrades:
 Testthemthoroughly.
 Bepreparedtoreverttotheknowngoodoriginalsystem.
ItseemsthatRIMhasproblemsinbothoftheseareas.
Failover
RIM has two perfectly good network operating centers. Why should they not back each other up
so that if one fails, traffic can be routed through the other NOC. Of course, both NOCs would
have to be configured to handle the full load; and the network would have to be capable of
rerouting users. This mightadd a lot of cost to RIM’s infrastructure, but who ever said continuous
availability was cheap? Its profits increased by a whopping 59% last quarter. Divert some of that
tocreatingareliableinfrastructure.
Communication
As pointed out in our earlier coverage, RIM continues to fail to provide rapid and thorough
communications regarding problems. Good communication goes a long way towards calming the
frustrateduser.RIM would do welltosetup astatus dashboardsuchas Amazon’sWebServices
Health Dashboard (http://status.aws.amazon.com) or Google’s Apps Status Dashboard

At the end of the day, it is incumbent upon you, the user, to make sure that you can survive a
failure in any of your mission-critical services. Email is rapidly becoming mission-critical to many
businesses.Do youhaveplans tocontinueoperations intheeventof anextendedemailoutage?
