##  Incident summary

An unknown entity gained control of an admin account for the Gentoo
GitHub Organization and removed all access to the organization (and its
repositories) from Gentoo developers. They then proceeded to make
various changes to content. Gentoo Developers & Infrastructure escalated
to GitHub support and the Gentoo Organization was frozen by GitHub
staff. Gentoo has regained control of the Gentoo GitHub Organization and
has reverted the bad commits and defaced content.

###  Impact

-   Approximately 5 days of GitHub being unavailable for Gentoo use.
-   Pull request CI was down; only master was being tested for issues.
-   The Gentoo Proxy Maintainers Project was impacted as many
    proxy-maint contributors use GitHub to submit PRs.
-   All past pull requests were apparently disconnected from their
    original commits and closed. GitHub can\'t fix it for us, so users
    have to open new pull requests.
-   The entity attempted to wipe user content by adding \"rm -rf\" to
    various repositories; however this code was unlikely to be executed
    by end users due to various technical guards in place.
-   Development not related to proxy-maint continued as normal; over 700
    commits were made during the incident.

####  Malicious content available

Initial clones of these repositories during these time intervals will
have malicious content. Gentoo recommends recreating these from a new
clone if you cloned during this period.

-   gentoo/gentoo: (2018-06-28 20:38 - 2018-06-29 06:58)
-   gentoo/musl: (2018-06-28 20:56 - 2018-06-29 06:59)
-   gentoo/systemd: (2018-06-28 21:07 - 2018-06-29 06:57)

###  Root cause

The attacker gained access to a password of an organization
administrator. Evidence collected suggests a password scheme where
disclosure on one site made it easy to guess passwords for unrelated
webpages.

##  Background

###  ][Gentoo\'s use of GitHub

The main Gentoo repositories are kept on Gentoo hosted infrastructure
and Gentoo mirrors to GitHub in order to \"be where the contributors
are.\" We do not believe the private keys of the account impacted were
at risk, and so the gentoo-hosted infrastructure was not impacted by
this incident.

##  Lessons

###  What went well

-   Gentoo responded quickly to reports of problems.
-   GitHub responded quickly and had a function to hide the impacted
    organization.
-   Gentoo quickly removed account access once the entry point was
    located.
-   GitHub provided audit logs that helped map out the incident.

###  What went badly

-   Initial communications were unclear and lacking detail in two areas.
    -   How can users verify their tree to be sure they had a clean
        copy?
    -   Clearer guidelines that even if users got bad copies of data
        with malicious commits, that the malicious commits would not
        execute.
-   Communications had three avenues (www.gentoo.org,
    infra-status.gentoo.org, and email lists.) Later we added a wiki
    page (this page) and were inconsistent on where to get updates.
-   GitHub failed to block access to the repositories via git, resulting
    in the malicious commits being externally accessible. Gentoo had to
    force-push over them as soon as this was discovered that.
-   Credential revocation procedures were incomplete.
-   We did not have a backup copy of the Gentoo GitHub Organization
    detail.
-   The systemd repo is not mirrored from Gentoo, but is stored directly
    on GitHub.

###  Lucky items

-   Numerous Gentoo Developers have personal contacts at GitHub, and in
    the security industry and these contacts proved valuable throughout
    the incident response.
-   The attack was loud; removing all developers caused everyone to get
    emailed. Given the credential taken, its likely a quieter attack
    would have provided a longer opportunity window.
-   The method by which the attackers pushed commits (force pushing
    their commits) made downstream consumption more conspicuous; this
    would have blocked git from silently pulling in new content to
    existing checkouts on \'git pull\'.

##  Appendix

###  Known malicious content

The following commits were known to be introduced by the unknown
entities. They were only present on the GitHub-hosted repositories, and
never present on the Gentoo-hosted master repositories.

-   gentoo/gentoo, master branch:
    -   e6db0eb4 (force-push)
    -   afcdc03b
    -   49464b73
    -   fdd8da2e
-   gentoo/musl, master branch:
    -   e6db0eb4 (force-push)
-   gentoo/systemd
    -   c46d8bbf (force-push)
    -   50e3544d

Once Gentoo regained access to the GitHub repositories, we forced-pushed
over these malicious repos.
