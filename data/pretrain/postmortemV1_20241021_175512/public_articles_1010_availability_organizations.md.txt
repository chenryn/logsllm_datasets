Many organizations offer availability advice and services. Those who want to specialize
in high- and continuous availability should be familiar with these organizations and
should take advantage of what they offer. The following is a summaryof just some of the more pertinent
groups.1
RIAC
The Reliability Information Analysis Center (RIAC), formerly known as the Reliability Analysis Center
(RAC), has served as a U.S. Department of Defence (DoD) Information Analysis Center (IAC) for more
than35 years.Assuch,theRIAC isaCenterofExcellenceandtechnicalfocalpointforinformation,data,
analysis, training, and technical assistance in the engineering fields of Reliability, Maintainability, Quality,
SupportabilityandInteroperability(RMQSI).
Although chartered by the DoD, the RIAC undertakes a variety of other government organizational and
industrial support projects each year. The team includes Wyle Laboratories, Quanterion Solutions, The
University of Maryland Center for Risk and Reliability, The Penn State University Applied Research
Laboratory, and The State University of New York Institute of Technology. Resources at their nationwide
locations include over 2,000 employees with various technical backgrounds and expertise. The RIAC
claims to provide total turnkey solutions to customers, including training, consulting services, and
publicationsandtoolsforbothgovernmentandcommercialbusinesses.

The Uptime Institute serves all stakeholders of the data-center industry, including enterprise and third-
party operations, manufacturers, providers, and engineers. This collaborative approach, coupled with the
Uptime Institute's capability to recognize trends on a global basis and to interface directly with owners,
results in solutions and innovations freed from regional constraints for the benefit of the worldwide data-
centerindustry.
Founded in 1993, the Institute pioneered the creation and facilitation of end-user knowledge communities
to improve reliability and uninterruptible availability—uptime—in data-center facilities and Information
Technology organizations. In 2009, the Institute was acquired by The 451 Group, a technology industry-
analystcompanyfocusingonthebusinessofenterpriseITinnovation.Thisistakenfromitswebsite:
“The 451 Group is the parent company of 451 Research, the Uptime Institute, and, from January
2013 the Yankee Group, the research, data and business advisory group. The Yankee Group is a
preeminentresearch,dataandadvisoryfirm.”

This web site is invaluable for general topics about availability and reliability plus some spine-chilling
service failures under the heading 'Never Again'. I would consider it compulsory reading for any
availability 'nerd' or involved management. Joining the Digest’s LinkedIn Continuous Availability Forum
canbeveryinformative.
WordsfromtheDigestwebsite:
“The digest of current topics on High Availability and Continuous Availability. High Availability
recovers from the effects of downtime. Continuous Availability avoids the effects of downtime. The
Digest includes case studies, horror stories, best practices, availability issues, product reviews,
recommendedreading,andsomemathematicalnerdstuff.”

IEEE Reliability Society
TheInstituteofElectricalandElectronicsEngineers(IEEE)sponsorsanorganizationdevotedtoreliability
in engineering, the IEEE Reliability Society (IEEE RS). The Reliability Society promotes industry-wide
acceptance of a systematic approach to design that will help to ensure reliable products. To that end, it
promotesreliabilitynotjustinengineeringbutinmaintenanceandanalysisaswell.
The Society encourages collaborative effort and information sharing among its membership, which
encompasses organizations and individuals involved in all areas of engineering, including aerospace,
transportationsystems,medicalelectronics,computersandcommunications.

SNIA: Storage Networking Industry Association
As anot-for-profitassociation,theSNIAenables its 400+members todeveloprobustsolutions for storing
and managing the massive volumes of information generated by today’s businesses. For more than a
decade, they have worked to bring recognition of storage issues to the IT world, making storage less
complicatedfortheenduser.

As a result, the SNIA has adopted the role of industry catalyst for the development of storage solution
specifications and technologies, global standards, and storage education. It has a number of Technical
Communities working on storage related topics, including Data Protection and Storage Security. SNIA
publishes availability articles and also has a very detailed and thorough article on RAID, which every
RAID-serious person should consult. There is also a '3-Year Strategic Plan for 2012-2015', all of which

Service Availability Forum (SAF)
The Service Availability Forum (SAF or SA Forum) is a consortium that develops, publishes, educates,
andpromotesopenspecificationsforcarrier-gradeandmission-criticalsystems. SAForum specifications
enable faster development and deployment of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) ecosystems for highly
availableplatforms.
SAF wasformedinDecember2001asasuccessortotheHA(HighAvailability)Forumthatpioneeredthe
standards-based architecture for high availability systems. SAF produced a white paper entitled
“ProvidingOpenArchitectureHighAvailabilitySolutions”.

What is OpenSAF Then?
OpenSAF stands for Open Service Availability Framework. OpenSAF is an open source community with
projectsfocusedonhighavailabilitymiddleware.
Thegoalof OpenSAF projects is todevelopHAmiddlewarethatis consistent with theServiceAvailability
Forum (SA Forum) specifications. OpenSAF is freely available to anyone under the LGPLv2.1 (Lesser
General Public License), and anyone may contribute to the project. The OpenSAF Foundation is a not-
for-profit organization established by leading communications and computing companies to facilitate the
workoftheOpenSAFprojectandtoacceleratetheadoptionofOpenSAFincommercialproducts.
The Foundation was inaugurated on January 22, 2008, by leading communications and enterprise
computing companies, including Emerson Network Power, Ericsson, HP, Nokia Siemens Networks, and

ROC Project - Software Resilience
The Recovery-Oriented Computing (ROC) project is a joint Berkeley/Stanford research project that is
investigatingnoveltechniquesforbuildinghighly-dependableInternetservices.Inasignificantdivergence
fromtraditional fault-tolerant approaches, ROC emphasizes recovery from failures rather than failure-
avoidance. This philosophy is motivated by the observation that even the most robust systems still
occasionallyencounterfailuresduetohumanoperatorerror,transientorpermanenthardwarefailure,and
softwareanomaliesresultingfrom"Heisenbugs"orsoftwareaging.
There are numerous articles on software reliability, most of them suggesting methods of development to
achievefaultdetection,avoidance,in-flightcorrectionandthelike,whilstacknowledgingthatwiththebest
development disciplines, errors will occur. Software reliability is by no means ‘business as usual’ as

Center for Software Reliability (CSR)
The Center for Software Reliability at City University London is an independent research center in the
SchoolofMathematics,ComputerScience,andEngineering,foundedin1983.AsCSR’s namesuggests,
its early research concerned the reliability of software - particularly the problems of measurement,
assuranceandpredictionofreliabilityusingprobabilisticmodeling-butthisquicklyexpandedintoamuch
widersystemsviewpoint,takingaccountofdifferentthreatstodependability.
CSR now addresses the dependability of systems, taking into account, for example, safety and security
as well as reliability. The current approach is now aimed at wider systems made up of software,
hardware,peopleandorganizations.
