Joyent Cloud Downed by Administrator
June2014
Joyent is a high-performance cloud provider aimed at real-time and mobile applications.
On Tuesday, May 27, 2014, one of Joyent’s data centers was taken totally offline by an
operatorerror.
Joyent uses open-source software developed by Sun Microsystems, including the SmartOS operating
systemandtheZFSfilesystem(“Z”initiallystoodforZettabyte,butonlytheacronymisnowused).
Joyent maintains data centers in San Francisco, Las Vegas, Northern Virginia, and Amsterdam. Joyent
touts itself as the high-performance cloud infrastructure and big data analytics company that serves
an eclectic mix of companies. Though primarily aimed at the highly volatile online social network game
market,JoyentoncehostedTwitterinitsearlydays.
Joyent promises high availabilitywith a 99.9999% uptime record in everyservice region as well as a
100% SLA. On its web site, Joyent positions itself against AmazonWeb Services (AWS) as a cloud with
higherperformanceandgreateravailability.Itdescribesitsarchitectureasfollows:
“A failing component only affects the infrastructure that is directly dependent upon it. For example, if
a disk fails, ZFS automatically begins resilvering – with minimal disruptions and no downtime to the
computenode.Ifanentirecomputenodefails,onlythevirtualmachinesprovisionedonthatnodefail;
othernodesareunaffected.Andintheunlikelyeventofbroaderfailuretheaffectedcomponentsstop,
butthefailuredoesnotspread.”
The Joyent Cloud Goes Down
Well, not quite. In the early afternoon of Tuesday, May 27, 2014, Joyent’s US-East-1 data center located
inAshburn,Virginia,begantoreport“transientavailabilityissues.”
After a quick investigation, Joyent administrators discovered the source. An operator had
erroneously entered a command to reboot all of the servers in the data center. The operator was
performing capacity upgrades to some of the compute nodes in the data center using tools that
allowed for remote updating of software. When he had completed the upgrades, he issued a
commandtorebootthoseservers.
Unfortunately, he mistyped the command. Instead of rebooting just the servers that he had
upgraded, he rebooted every server in the data center. There was no validation in the reboot
command tools to ensure the operator was "really sure" that he/she wanted the reboot to be
performed against all systems. All of the servers in the data center stopped functioning during the
rebootprocess,andtheentireUS-East-1datacenterwasdown.

Joyent was refreshingly transparent with rapid blog communications to its customers. In an early
post,itsaid:
“Due to an operator error, all compute nodes in us-east-1 were simultaneously rebooted. Some
compute nodes are already back up, but due to very high load on the control plane, this is taking
sometime.Wearededicatingalloperationalandengineeringresources togettingthis issueresolved

fat finger to take down a datacenter. As soon as we reasonably can, we will be providing a full
postmortem of this: how this was architecturally possible, what exactly happened, how the
system recovered, and what improvements we are/will be making to both the software and to

"The operator that made the error is mortified, there is nothing we could do or say for that
operatorthatisgoingtomakeitanyworse,frankly.”
80% of Joyent’s customers were returned to service within an hour.However, a known transient bug
in a network card driver on Joyent’s legacy hardware platforms extended recovery times for some
customersto2½hours
The Postmortem
Thecauseoftheoutagewasthatanadminwasusingatooltoremotelyupdatethesoftwareon
somenewserversinJoyent'sdatacenterand,whentryingtorebootthem,accidentallyrebootedall
oftheserversinthefacility.Initspostmortem,Joyentexplained:
"The command to reboot the select setof newsystemsthat needed to be updated wasmistyped
and instead specified all servers in the datacenter. Unfortunately, the tool in question does not
have enough input validation to prevent this from happening without extra steps/confirmation,
and went ahead and issued a reboot command to every server in us-east-1 availability zone
withoutdelay.
"First, we will be dramaticallyimproving the tooling that humans(and systems) interact with such
that input validation is much more strict and will not allow for all servers and control plane
servers to be rebooted simultaneously. We want to reiterate our apology for the magnitude of
this issue and the impact it caused our customers and their customers. We will be working as
diligently as we can, and as expediently as we can, to prevent an issue like this from happening
again."

outages.Theyare:
1. UPSfailures.
2. Humanerrors.
3. DDoSattacks.
It is said that 70% of all outages are caused by or are aggravated by humans. Humans need
redundancy too when critical actions are to be taken. If the Joyent operator had someone else
