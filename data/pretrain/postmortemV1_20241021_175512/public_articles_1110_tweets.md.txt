– Our October Twitter Feed of Outages
October2016
A challenge every issue for the Availability Digest is to determine which of the many
availability topics out there win coveted status as Digest articles. We always regret not
focusing our attention on the topics we bypass.With our new Twitter presence, we don’t
have to feel guilty. This article highlights some of the tweets that made headlines in
recentdays.

Disaster Recovery Planning Actually Starts with Planning to Fail
For disaster recovery done right, failure is not only an option – it’s mandatory. Despite the obvious
costs of unplanned downtime and the damage done to brands,many companies end up caught with
either an inadequate disaster recovery (DR) plan or none at all. Market researcher IDC estimates
that as many as 50 percent of organizations have DR plans that fall short of the mark. To establish
the foundation of a thorough DR plan, you need to accept five tenets and assumptions. The first is
thefollowing: “PlanningtoFailoverisPlanningtoFail.”

Frustration mounted across Puerto Rico in late September amid record-high heat as the U.S.
territory struggled to restore electricity more than two days after a power plant fire caused an island-
wide blackout when it shut down an aging utility grid. The blackout affected the entire island of 3.5
millionpeople.

Grid Assurance: a new alliance to protect the US transmission system
SixUS energy giants have allied to establish a newcompany to maintain a national inventoryof grid
equipmentso thatvital transmission systemsdamaged byattacksornaturaldisastersquicklycanbe
restored.Themodernelectricgrid losespower285%more oftenthan the one in1984,whenrecords
began, at an annual cost to businesses of USD $150bn. The root causes include aging
infrastructure, a lack of investment in grid modernisation, and policy gaps at local and federal level,
exacerbated by increased energy demand. Add to that threats from terrorism and climate change,
and it is no surprise that federal agencies and policymakers have identified enhancing transmission

Notavailability-related,justanFYI.Tropicalvs.Non-Tropical:What'sTheDifference?
A tropical (or warm core) cyclone (area of low pressure) usually forms over warm waters in the
tropics. Air rises rapidly around the edges of the center of the storm. Sinking air in the center of the
storm heats up the air, so the storm has warm temperatures from the surface all the way up to high
levels of the atmosphere. Hurricanes and tropical storms are (warm core) tropical cyclones. A non-
tropical (or cold core) storm has the coldest temperatures in the center of the storm. Temperatures
coolasyoumove higherin theatmosphere and there isatrough atthehighestlevels.Unlike tropical
(warm core) storms, winds are not as concentrated near the center of the storm but can spread out
forhundredsofmilesfromit.

What Facebook Has Learned from Regularly Shutting Down Entire Data Centers
Facebook has one of the boldest approaches to testing its infrastructure resiliency. The Facebook
data centerteamregularlyshuts down entire sitesto see how its application will behave and to learn
what improvements can be made. The idea to do these kinds of stress tests was born after
Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc on Internet infrastructure on the East Coast in 2012. Facebook’s
head of engineering and infrastructure recently shared some of the big lessons that the company
haslearnedfromits“firedrills.”
