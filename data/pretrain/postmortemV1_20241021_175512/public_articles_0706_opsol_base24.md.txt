Major U.S. Bank Replaces BASE24

OpsolIntegrators,Inc.
One of the five largest banks in the United States recently moved its debit/credit card authorization
network from ACI’s BASE24toOpsol’s OmniPayments financial-transactionauthorizationsystem running
on HP NonStop servers. This move accomplished two goals. It allowed the Bank to keep its highly
available NonStop servers in operation following ACI’s announcement that it would “sunset” BASE24 on
NonStop. In addition, it allowed the Bank to save millions of dollars in licensing costs over the life of the
system.
The Bank’s Early Authorization Network
TheBankmaintainsanetworkof15,000ATMsandthousandsofretailPOS(point-of-sale)devices.Inthe
mid-1990s, it decided to adopt ACIWorldwide, Inc.’s BASE24 product running on HP NonStop servers to
interface with the various interchange networks, such as Visa and MasterCard that banks use to
authorize debit- and credit-card transactions. NonStop servers provide proven high availability, immense
scalability, and bullet-proof data integrity, all characteristics needed bythe bank to protect its critical ATM
andPOSservices.
However,BASE24didnothavetheabilitiesthattheBank neededtomanageitsATMnetwork.TheATMs
represented the public face of the Bank, and for competitive reasons it needed to provide a superior
experiencetoitscustomersthroughitsATMs.Forinstance,itwantedcustomerstobeabletomodifytheir
ownpreferences,toselectlanguages oftheirchoice,tohaveaccesstoa widerangeofbankingservices,
andtoreceivepersonalizedoffersgeneratedbytheBank,noneofwhichweresupportedbyBASE24.
It therefore made the decision to turn to Opsol Integrators Inc. to provide the system for managing its
ATMs. Opsol installed its OmniATM product on the same NonStop servers being used to run BASE24
and interfaced OmniATM to BASE24. OmniATM was configured to provide all of the customized features
desiredbytheBank.
The resulting architecture of the early system is shown in Figure 1. OmniATM managed the Bank’s
extensiveATMnetworkandsupportedalloftheATMenhancementsdesiredbytheBank.
OmniATM analyzed incoming transactions from the Bank’s ATMs to determine whether they were
generated by a debit- or credit-card issued by the Bank (on-us transactions) or by another bank (not-on-
us transactions). OmniATM routed on-us transactions directly to the Bank’s IBM authorization system,
and that system’s response to accept or reject the transaction was returned to the initiating ATM by
OmniATM.

OmniATM passed transactions that were generated by debit/credit cards issued by other banks to
BASE24 for authorization. BASE24 sent each not-on-us transaction to the issuing bank over the
appropriateinterchangenetworkandreturnedtheresponsetoOmniATMforreturntotheinitiatingATM.
If a transaction was initiated at an ATM not owned by the Bank but with a card issued by the Bank, the
reverse process occurred. The remote managing bank sent the transaction over an interchange network
to BASE24 for authorization. BASE24 passed the request to the Bank’s IBM authorization system. The

Revisiting the BASE24 Decision
A decade and a half later, ACI Worldwide shocked its 300 BASE24 NonStop customers when it
announced that it would sunset its NonStop BASE24 product by 2011. To obtain continued ACI support
on NonStop servers, customers would have to migrate to ACI’s new financial transaction switching
product,BASE24-eps,or paysignificantlyincreasedsupportcostsforBASE24BASE24-epsis anentirely
newproductandrequiresacomplexandriskymigration.

This announcement triggered an in-depth review by the Bank of its current system for financial-
transaction authorization. The Bank concluded that there were compelling reasons to revisit its existing
approach:
MigrationtoBASE24-epsonNonStopServers
The migration to BASE24-eps on NonStop servers would require significant new development to
incorporate all of the specialized features needed by the Bank. The migration would be lengthy, costly,
andrisky.EvenHPpredicteda30%chancethatthemigrationwouldbeunsuccessful.1

MigrationtoBASE24-epsonanIBMMainframe
If the Bank replaced its NonStop servers with an IBM mainframe, it would totally change the culture of its
IT department. The system administrators that were familiar with the nuances of the card-authorization
process were HP NonStop administrators. Either they would have to be retrained to become familiar with
the IBM mainframe, or IBM administrators would have to be retained and trained in the authorization
process.
Furthermore, the fault-tolerant NonStop systems had rock-solid availability. It is imperative to the Bank
that its ATM and POS networks always be available. If the Bank cannot authorize transactions, retail
activity using its services ceases. NonStop servers have field-proven availability that is an order of
magnitude greater than IBM mainframes (unless the complex and expensive dual-processor IBM Parallel
Sysplexsystemsareused).
TotalCostofOwnership
The support and licensing fees for BASE24 had skyrocketed with ACI’s sunset announcement. The
license fees were tiered and were based on the peak monthlytransaction volume experienced during the
prior yearofoperation.Thus,thegreatlyexaggeratedholidaypeaksofpurchasingactivitydeterminedthe
licensefeesforallofthenextyear.
The Bank handled 300 million ATM and POS transactions a month. 90% of them, or 270 million
transactions per month, were incoming transactions that flowed through BASE24 from the ATMs of other
banks. Thus, BASE24 activity accounted for the majority of the costs of running the Bank’s ATM/POS
networks.
Studying Its Alternatives
Toidentifyaplausiblealternative,theBank’sstaffaskedthemselves:
WhydowewanttomigrateoffofBASE24?
Whatareouroptions?
Howpainfulisittodothemigration?
The answer to the first question was very clear and is summarized above. Maintaining the NonStop level
of service, retaining the knowledge and experience of the Bank’s IT department, and reducing licensing
costs whileminimizing the risk of theBank’s new approach were paramount drivers inthe staff’s decision
making.
Theoptions wereto makeasignificant investmentin BASE24-eps tocustomize ittothe Bank’s needs, to

All of the options had their degrees of pain. However, the Bank already had a successful and satisfying
relationship over several years with Opsol and its OmniATM product. The Bank also was familiar with
Opsol’s OmniPayments financial-transaction authorization system. The underlying foundation for

It was clear that moving from BASE24 to
OmniPayments was a viable and minimum-risk
solution. The move would retain the NonStop
culture of the Bank’s IT department. The continued
high availability of the Bank’s card services through
the NonStop fault-tolerant architecture would be
preserved. And thanks to OmniPayments’ model of
licensing based on the number of processors in the
NonStop system instead of ACI’s tiered licensing
model based on transaction volume, this solution
could save substantially on the Bank’s yearly
licensingcosts.
The OmniPayments Project
The Bank’s upgraded OmniPayments financial-
transaction authorization system is shown in Figure
2. OmniPayments is a layered architecture. It is
builtuponthefault-tolerantHPNonStopserver.
The core layer of OmniPayments is Opsol’s
OmniDirector Enterprise Service Bus. OmniDirector
services include data transformation, encryption,
intelligent routing, and communication-failure recovery. It also provides adapters to support those
protocols required to communicate with the Bank’s ATMs and POS network as well as with its IBM
authorizationsystemandtransactioninterchangessuchasVisa,MasterCard,STAR,andPULSE.
Business logic modules, or BLMs, provide the business functions of OmniPayments. They include
withdrawal and deposit services for ATMs andmobile devices as well as authorization bythe Bank’s IBM
authorization system and the interchange networks. A BLM is provided to offer stand-in authorization
shouldtheBank’sauthorizationsystem becomeunavailable.OmniPayments includesasettlementbatch-

The Results
OmniPayments was online and working with thefirstinterchange network,STAR, inthree months.Within
a year, the complete OmniPayments system was online and communicating with ten interchange
networks, including Visa, MasterCard, PULSE, STAR, and others. As expected, the risk of migrating to
OmniPayments was minuscule as compared to upgrading to ACI’s new and different product, BASE24-
eps.
The Bank easily made ACI’s 2011 sunset deadline and terminated license payments to ACI on the first
day of 2012. It continues to run card-authorization services on its highly available HP NonStop systems.
Perhaps most importantly, it has significantly reduced its five-year licensing cost by moving 90% of its
transactionloadtoaproductwhoselicensingisinsensitivetotransactionrates.
