everRun Overview
TheeverRunArchitecture
everRunistightlyintegratedwiththeopen-sourceKVMhypervisorandrunsontwoindustry-standardx86
host servers. Applications run in virtualized machine (VM) guest operating systems supported by
everRun. Each VM has an identical instance running on each host server. The everRun Availability
Services synchronize the applications running in each host server via an Availability Link so that if a
physicalserverfails,theapplicationsinthesurvivingservercarryonwithoutinterruptionordataloss.
Neither the application nor the user is exposed to the redundant computing resources on the two host
servers. The application sees only one hostname. If a fault or failure occurs, everRun software

automatically redirects I/O to the paired host server for continuous operation. Though redundancy is lost
until the failure is repaired, the client experiences no interruption in connectivity and no loss of data. The
application continues to execute as if nothing happened. Repair of the failed host server is equally
transparent and automatic. When a failed host server is repaired, everRun software automatically
incorporates it into the protected environment and restores redundancy without interrupting the
application.
WhyKVM?
The open-source community has implemented a virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware – the
Kernel-basedVirtualMachine.KVMis differentfrom other hypervisors becauseitis anintegralpartof the
Linux operating environment. Thus, KVM can take advantage of core features already hardened within
Linux. It also is designed to take advantage of the hardware-assisted virtualization features that Intel and
AMD have built into their processors. KVM can run unmodified Windows and Linux images in virtual
machines.
As an active contributor to KVM, Stratus has integrated KVM into its everRun availability software to
enable the virtualization capabilities that allow everRun to provide its fault-tolerant and high-availability
services.
Availability Modes
everRun has two availability modes – everRun Enterprise, which supplies full fault tolerance, and
everRunExpress,whichprovidesdisasterrecovery.
everRunEnterpriseFaultTolerance
everRun Enterprise furnishes fault-tolerance for applications running in its environment. In fault-tolerant
mode, an application continues to run without downtime during a fault. everRun Enterprise is used for
applicationsthatneedthehighestlevelsofavailability.
In fault-tolerant operation, the everRun software transparently protects an application by creating a
redundant environment for a VM running across two host servers. With an identical instance of the
selectedVMonasecondhost,everRunEnterprise:
 EliminatesdowntimeduetoanyCPU,memory,I/O,orotherhost-systemfailure.
 HandlesfailureswithoutITintervention.
 Ensuresnodataloss.
 Providescontinuous,activevalidationofallcomponents.
 Ensurescompleteredundancyandrecoveryatalltimes.
everRunExpressHighAvailability
everRun Express provides high availability for applications running in its environment. In high-availability
mode, everRun automatically detects, isolates, and handles most hardware faults, thereby keeping
applicationsrunning.

everRunAvailabilityServices
The everRun Availability Services depend upon the redundant Availability Link communication channel
connecting the everRun environments running in each host server. The Availability Services monitor the
state of each of the VM instances and perform recoveryof an instance should it fail. If the failed instance
isthecurrentlyactiveinstance,AvailabilityServicesmanagesthefailovertothebackupVMinstance.
In fault-tolerant mode, if one host server should fail, the application will continue to run on the other host
server without any interruption or data loss. In high-availability mode, one host server is active; and the
other is a standby. If the active host server fails, the application is restarted on the standby host server
withminimalinterruptionordataloss.
All input/output operations and state changes are automaticallymirrored to the redundant host server via
the Availability Link. This “statepointing” ensures that all in-flight transactions as well as data in memory
andcachearepreserved.
The everRun operating environment is first built on one server with KVM. The Stratus Availability
Extensions then are used to create the fault-tolerant or high-availability environment. At this point, the

Networks
PrivateNetwork
Every everRun system requires one private network.The private network connects the two everRun host
servers and is used only for discovery. The simplest private network consists of a single Ethernet cable
thatdirectlyconnectsthetwosystems.
AvailabilityLinks
The Availability Link (A-Link) allows everRun to synchronize disks, to shunt networks, to migrate VMs
between host servers, to perform heartbeat checks, and to synchronize fault-tolerant memory. The A-link

ManagementNetwork
Every everRun installation must have a management network. It provides connectivity to the everRun
Availability Console and handles miscellaneous management tasks. It also provides the connectivity to
thequorumserver(s)describedlater.
BusinessNetworks
All other Ethernet ports – aside from the A-Link and management networks – are considered business
networkports.Theguestoperatingsystemsusetheseportstoconnecttoexternalnetworks.
SplitSite Configurations
A SplitSite configuration connects two physical machines in two separate sites. It is a disaster-tolerant
deployment that maintains hardware redundancy as well as redundancy of physical computer rooms and
the buildings containing them. Because of the geographic separation, a SplitSite configuration requires
carefulplanningofcomponentplacementandmorecomplexnetworkingtopologies.
SplitSite provides application availability across geographically separated sites using synchronous
replication. Therefore, A-Link round-trip channel communication latency must be limited to 10
milliseconds for high-availability VMs and 2 milliseconds for fault-tolerant VMs. Most deployments can be
separatedbyuptotenkilometers.
For SplitSite configurations, Stratus strongly recommends that a quorum server be used because a
SplitSiteconfigurationexposestheA-Linknetworkstootherpotentialfailurescenarios.
Quorum Servers
It is recommended that a quorum server be configured for both fault-tolerant and high-availability
operation. The quorum server prevents a condition called split-brain, where both host servers of a high-
availability or fault-tolerant pair have lost communication with each other and are running independently.

Quorum servers ensure the integrity of VMs against multiple network failure scenarios, including split-

Simplex Operation
A simplex everRun system may be used in a disaster-recovery configuration. In such a configuration,
fault-tolerant- and/or high-availability-protected virtual machines run on a duplex everRun system at one
site;andsnapshotsofthoseVMsarereplicatedtoasimplexsystematanothersite.
If a failure occurs on the duplex system such that the VMs on it are not able to operate, VMs can be
startedfromthesnapshotsontheremotesimplexsystem.
The everRun Availability Console
TheeverRun AvailabilityConsoleis abrowser-based interfacethatprovides managementandmonitoring
of an everRun system from a remote management computer. Many administrative operations can be
performed from the console because it allows access to the system as a whole as well as to physical
machines(hostservers),virtualmachines,andotherresources.

 Setsystem preferences,diagnostics,notifications (e-Alerts and SNMPconfiguration),andremote

Remote Support
With remote-support technology, the everRun software notifies the Stratus support center of various
issues, indicating the type of fault and its exact location. This combination of automatic fault detection,
isolation, and remote-support technologies ensures speedy access to expert support technicians and
rapidproblemresolution.
Summary
Stratus everRun is installed at hundreds of sites supporting mission-critical solutions. Coupled with its
redundant hardware-based, fault-tolerant ftServer and its continuously available OpenStack Cloud
Solutions, Stratus Technologies has been a leader for over thirty years in providing high-availability and
fault-tolerantsolutionsforapplicationsthatsimplycannotfailorlosedata.
I have personallyused Stratus systems to implement manymission-critical systems, including world-wide
correspondent networks for Time Magazine and McGraw-Hill. I continue to be impressed with the
continuousavailabilitythatthesesystemsprovide.
