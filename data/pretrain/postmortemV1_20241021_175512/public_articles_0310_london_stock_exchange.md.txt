London Stock Exchange PC-Trading System Down for a Day
October2008
On Monday, September 8, 2008, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) – the third largest stock
exchange in the world – crashed for most of the day. Hundreds of millions of pounds in lost
commission revenue resulted on what turned out to be one of the most hectic trading days of the
year.
The LSE had recently moved its trading system from Tandem fault-tolerant computers (now HP
NonStop) to a massive distributed PC-based system called TradElect. Was the crash a failure in
the new PC network? Was it due to trading volume? Was it an upgrade gone wrong? Was it
causedbyanetworkfailure?WhoknowsbecausetheExchangeremainssilentonthecause.
The London Stock Exchange
The London Stock Exchange is one of the world’s oldest stock exchanges and can trace its
history back more than 300 years to 1698. Starting life in the coffee houses of 17th century
London, the Exchange quickly grew to become one of London’s most important financial
institutions.
The Outage
September 8th promised to be one of the most active days in trading history. The U.S.
government had just announced a $200 million bailout plan for its secondary mortgage giants,
FannieMaeandFreddieMac.1Thetraders ontheLondonStock Exchange were readyfor avery

Traders estimated that lost commissions would average about £700,000 per firm, giving an
overalllossmeasuredinthemillionsofpounds.
This was the worst outage suffered bythe LSE in eight years. The last significant outage was on
April 5, 2000, the last day of the tax year in the U.K., when the trading system failed and closed
the Exchange for eight hours. This outage was due to connectivity problems with the London
MarketInformationLink.
Coincidentally, the recent September 8th outage coincided with an outage of the Intercontinental
Exchange (ICE), which shut down the London commodity markets for an hour. There was,
however,nolinkbetweentheseoutages.
The damage was not limited to the London Stock Exchange. The LSE is aggressively marketing
their TradElect trading system to other exchanges around the world. The Johannesburg Stock
Exchange now uses TradElect, and it was similarly affected. The JSE boasts on its web site that

The TradElect Trading System
TradElect is a 15-month-old proprietary trading system that was launched in June, 2007. It is a
massive distributed system employing over 100 HP ProLiant PCs in several locations in London.
It was developed at a cost of £40 million over a four-year period for the LSE as a joint effort by
MicrosoftandAccenture.It is basedonWindows Server 2003,SQL Server 2000, andMicrosoft’s
.NETframework.ApplicationsarewritteninC#.
TradElect had several design goals, predominant among which were significantly increased
speed and capacity over the old LSE system. So far as speed is concerned, trade execution
timeswerereducedfrom140millisecondstotenmilliseconds.
Capacity was increased by five-fold; and at the time of the system’s installation, it was claimed
that TradElect could handle the entire trading volume of all European equities. Furthermore,
capacitycouldbefurtherdoubledforanadditionalcostthatwasonly20%ofthesystem’soriginal
cost.
Another design goal was extreme reliability. Microsoft claimed that the system had “100%
reliability.” Dual processing sites were configured, and the system could recover from any
component failure within a second. It is reported that the LSE offers a five-9s SLA (Service Level
Agreement).2Unfortunately,thisoutageshootstheSLAforthenext84years.
The successful launch of TradElect in 2007 followed the inauguration of the Exchange’s Infolect
system in October, 2005. Infolect is a market data-reporting system that can deliver the current
priceforanyequitywithintwomilliseconds.Itbroadcasts20millionmessagesperdayto100,000
terminals in 100 countries. Infolect is also a massive distributed PC system using HP ProLiant
computerswithMicrosoftSQLServerandthe.Netframework.
What Went Wrong?
What exactly caused the outage has never been divulged by the London Stock Exchange, at
least so far as the Availability Digest knows. There have been several early statements from the
Exchangeandseveralconjecturesfromindustrypundits.Butnocausehasbeenconfirmed.
Most conjecture has focused on the possibility of a network problem. Others thought that it might
have been caused by the massive volume of trades that day. Still others suspected a software

problem in the TradElect system or a problem with an upgrade. Many asked the question “Why
wastherenobackupsystemthatcouldtakeover?”
On September 9th, the Wall Street Journal reported that the previous day’s outage was caused
bytheproprietaryplatformfromMicrosoft.
One source close to the Exchange was reported as having said that it was an upgrade that had
gonewrong.
The Financial Times noted that the problems were thought to have occurred on the trading
gateway between the LSE’s Extranex private network (linking the exchange and its clients) and
the TradElect trading platform. The gateway is implemented with Cisco equipment. Cisco had no
comment.
Computerworld UK claimed that the Exchange had confirmed that a network software problem
caused the outage. An LSE spokesperson told Computerworld UK that an undisclosed “fix” had
been applied to the software and that the LSE was confident the systems would now function
properly.
An LSE spokesperson told Reuters UK that “It was software-related, a coincidence, due to two
processes we couldn’t have foreseen. We’ve introduced a fix and we’re confident it will not
happen again.” The spokesperson emphasized that the outage was not due to high volumes.
“That’saredherring.Wewereabletoeliminatethatprettyquickly.”
Whatever the problem was, it has not been publicly disclosed by the Exchange. However, the
preponderance of public opinion is that the problem was a software problem in the network
connectingthetraderstotheTradElecttradingplatform.
Lessons Learned
This problem was a huge embarrassment for the LSE. It could not have happened at a worse
time. It came only days after the introduction of the European Union’s “Markets in Financial
InstrumentsDirective”thatopeneduptradingcompetitionbeyondtraditionalexchanges.TheLSE
is now facing intense competition from new entrants offering trading platforms backed by banks
and other exchanges. Competition includes Chi-X, Turquoise, the Nasdaq OMX, and NYSE
Euronext–aconsortium oftheNewYork Stock Exchange,theParisBourse,andotherEuropean
exchanges.
Ironically, in a letter published the very morning of the outage, LSE chief executive Dame Clara
Furse dismissed the challenge of the Exchange’s competitors, describing the LSE’s technology
as“cutting-edge.”
What can we learn from this disaster? Not much since the Exchange has divulged little
informationconcerningwhatwentwrong.
But whatwecansayisthattheLondonStock Exchangehasnotlearnedthelessonthatsomany
other large enterprises have following their own outages, as our Never Again stories continue to
show. Those that communicated frequently and honestly with their clients found patience and
support. Those that were noncommunicative suffered the wrath of their clients. Some of these
companies learned from this experience and have since significantly improved their
communication skills. Others have yet to learn this lesson. It appears that the London Stock
Exchangehasawaytogo.
