Southwest Airlines’ Router Grounds 2,300 Flights
August2016
Southwest Airlines, headquartered in Dallas,Texas,U.S.A., is the world’s largest low-
cost air carrier. It was established in 1967 and operates about
3,900 flights daily. It carries the most domestic passengers of
anyU.S.airline.
In July, 2016, a router failure grounded Southwest Airlines for
four days. The airline had to cancel 2,300 flights, and thousands
ofotherflightsfromSanFranciscotoBostonweredelayed.
The Router Failure
A router in Southwest’s network failed in a very unusual way. It was only a partial failure, so the backup
router did not detect the failure and consequently did not take over the routing functions. The router
outagetookdownSouthwest’swebsitesandnumerousapplicationsforseveralhours.
During this time, Southwest was unable to operate. This was the worst data-processing outage in the
company’s history. Southwest’s CEO issuedanapology,sayingthatthe waythe router failedwas sorare
thecompanycouldnothavepreparedforit.
We have stressed the importance of failover testing in the Availability Digest many times, and this is an
excellent example of whyfailover testing is so important Any imaginable outage should be simulated and
tested to ensure that failover will work. Most companies do not do this because such testing is disruptive
and expensive. However, in Southwest’s case, this could have saved it about $10 million dollars in lost
bookings.
Wednesday, July 20th
On Wednesday afternoon, July 20, 2016, the router failure described above occurred. Southwest’s
technical team tried for hours to restore the router or its backup, but was unable to do so. In frustration,
the team finally had to reboot the routers and many of the servers in the Southwest network, a process
thattookadditionalhours.Duringthistime,Southwest’swebsitesandmanyapplicationsweredown.
Southwest was unable to schedule any flights. Its operations were basically shut down. The airline’s
customer service phone lines, social media outlets, and airport agents were all swamped with high
volume

By the end of the day, Southwest announced that it had finally fixed its data processing problems.
However, one of the applications that had been down was the crew-scheduling system. Between the
outage of this application and the cancellation of so many flights, crews and aircraft were not in the

Most of Southwest’s systems were back online as of the beginning of the operational day on Thursday,
July 21st. However, disruptions continued as the airline repositioned its aircraft and crews to meet its
normalschedules.
Southwest cancelled an additional 900 flights on Thursday. Delays continued to affect hundreds of other

According to Southwest’s CEO, Gary Kelly, the outage cost the airline $10 million in lost bookings in

Special Accommodations for Affected Passengers
Southwest bent over backwards to accommodate affected passengers. Customers who had booked
travel from Wednesday, July 20th, through Tuesday, July 26th, were given two weeks from their original
date of departure to rebook and begin travel at their original fare at no additional cost. If they preferred,

In addition, the airline extended by a week its major sale on fares that was supposed to have ended on
Thursday,July21st.

Furthermore, Southwest gave customers who were affected by the glitch a virtually unrestricted 50%-off

Postscript
Southwest’s glitch affected flights for four straight days, led to 2,300 cancellations, and delayed
thousands of flights. According to most reports, Southwest made the right moves to compensate its
customersfortheinconvenienceithadcausedbythisoutage.
CEO Gary Kelly quicklycame out with a public statement acknowledging the problem and apologizing to
fliers.ASouthwestspokespersonsaid:
“Weknow it’s a long journey to re-earning your trust, but it’s our mission to do it. We’ve done a lot of
apologizing to our customers and have thanked our employees for their hard work, but what we
haven’t done is thanked both for having respect for one another. The last four days have tested
patience and heightened emotions. Make no mistake, Southwest created this problem.We own that,
andthereis no victorylaptobehadfor asituationthat has breddisappointmentandshakenthetrust
customershaveinSouthwestAirlines.”
Even so, it was estimated that the lost bookings alone caused by this outage could cost the airline
upwards of $10 million. The airline now plans to replace its legacy reservation system next year and is
enteringathree-tofive-yearplantoupdateitsotherlegacysystems.
As is the case with many other airlines, Southwest has been operating with legacy systems that were
deployed decades ago when the airline was much smaller. Its growth has been phenomenal, and it is

With today’s modern data-processing capability, new systems can be tested with agile test management
tools. Organizations can write and execute manual and automated tests. This allows the evaluation of
newfeatures,testingofsystem resilience,andverifyingthatresourcescanberestoredeasilyintheevent
of an outage. Developers and testers can work together across the nation, delivering qualityupdates and
receiving real-time progress updates showing what still needs to be completed and what defects have
beenidentified.
As Southwest Airlines moves into the modern world of data processing technology, catastrophic outages
such as the one that took it down in July should be a thing of the past. Perhaps in the future, it will be
