Jim Gray – In Memoriam
July2008
Jim Gray has been a computing legend since the 1970s. Perhaps
his most visible contribution has been in the field of transaction
processing. Jim’s work in this field is what now powers network
applicationsfrom ATMstoInternetshoppingtoenterprisemission-
critical applications. He was the recipient of the prestigious Turing
Award in 1998 for “seminal contributions to database and
transactionprocessingresearch.”
Jim Gray was 63 when he was lost at sea eighteen months ago.
On Sunday, January28, 2007, he set sail in his forty-foot sailboat,
Tenacious,enroutetotheFarallonIslands,awildliferefugejust27
miles off the shore of Northern California, to spread the ashes of
his mother. By nightfall, Jim had vanished without a trace. His
disappearance triggered one of the most massive search-and-
rescueeffortsinhistory.
This article is not about the search for his whereabouts, though it

Mentoring was one of Jim’s strengths. He mentored such people http://research.microsoft.com/~Gray/
asWernerVogels,CTOofAmazon,andSergeyBrin,cofounderofGoogle.Andhementoredme.
I first met Jim when he was at Tandem Computers working on fault-tolerant, high-capacity
databases. Though he was a decade my junior, he was more of a father figure to me. I often
shared my work with him. He touted my book on Performance Analysis of Transaction
Processing Systems as one of the most readable books on performance analysis that he had
come across. When he first read Breaking the Availability Barrier, which I coauthored with two
others, he said “Wow! What a great book. Very readable, very direct. I loved the laws,” a
statementthatheallowedustopublish.
This support was all the more important because of the stature that Jim had achieved in the
technologyworld.
Steve Silberman, contributing editor toWired Magazine, wrote a wonderful story about Jim Gray,
his achievements, and the search for him. Dated July 24, 2007, it was published in Wired
Magazine in its Issue 8, Volume 17.1 Much of the material in this article is taken from Steve’s
work.

Jim Gray – The Technologist
Born in 1944, Jim enrolled in UC Berkeley in 1961 as a mathematics student. However, he
discoveredcomputers whenhetook acourseinnumericalanalysis,theonlymathematics course
at Berkeley that offered access to a computer. He went on to earn the university’s first PhD in
computersciencesin1969.
Jim joined Bell Labs for a short stint and then moved to IBM Research Labs. There he joined a
team involved in research on Ted Codd’s recently published concepts describing a relational
database.TheteamwastaskedwithtryingtoturnCodd’stheoriesintofunctionalsoftware.
Jim focused mainly on a new concept called “transactions.” A transaction was a bounded set of
database operations that were atomic – theyeither were all applied to the database successfully,
ornonewere.Thequestionshewastryingtoanswerincluded:
 Whenshouldchangesbefirmlycommittedtothedatabase?
 Whatifoneofapairoftransactionsfailedhalfwaythrough?
 How can many users access and update the same data simultaneously without
corruptingthedatabase?
In his research papers, he likened transactions to a marriage contract. When is the right time to
say “I do”? His solutions are embedded in our network world, from the corner ATM to enterprise
applications,toonlineshopping,andonandon.
Jim and his colleagues created one of the first relational databases, which they called System R.
System R was the first implementation of Structured Query Language (SQL), which has since
becomethestandardrelationaldataquerylanguage.2
Most techies considered business data processing to be beneath them. For instance, how
exciting was it to help Bank of America reconcile checking accounts? But not a young
entrepreneurnamedLarryEllison.WorkingatAmpexonadata-storagesystem namedOraclefor
the CIA, Larry started a fledgling company using System R’s technical papers as a blueprint to
develop a relational database for the minicomputer market. He brought his product to market
underthenameofOracle.
Years later, in an obvious reference to Oracle, Jim said during an interview that his life had been
a “researcher’s dream – you have a lot of fun, you do something innovative, and then people
makebillionsofdollarsoffofit.”
However, Jim was no stranger to productizing advanced theoretical concepts. For instance, he
contributed heavily to the development of one of IBM’s first relational databases – DB2. DB2
remainstodayapopulardatabasemarketedandfullysupportedbyIBM.
In the 1980s, Jim moved to Tandem Computers to continue his work on high-availabilitysystems
and transaction processing, contributing to Tandem’s Transaction Monitoring Facility (TMF) and
NonStop SQL. TMF and NonStop SQL provide the transaction-processing engine that is
recognizedtodayasoneofthemostpowerfulandscalableintheindustry.
Early implementations of relational databases suffered greatly from performance issues. To
improve performance, Gray met with 25 colleagues from various commercial and university
institutions to coauthor an anonymous article that defined a measurement for computer
performance.3 The Debit/Credit benchmark that was proposed by this group evolved to become
the TPC-C standard defined by the Transaction Processing Performance Council. TPC-C and its

successors are widely used today for comparative measures of performance by database and
computervendors.
These benchmarks verified the exponential improvement in the power of transaction-processing
systemsoverthefollowingyears.A1998$10millionTandem system hadthecapacitytoprocess
about 200 transactions per second. This system comprised 34 CPUs and 86 disks. Just seven
yearslater,a$400Toshibadesktopcomputerprocessedover8,000transactionspersecond!4
Jim left Tandem and joined Digital Equipment Corporation to continue his work in transaction
processing.ItwasduringhisTandemandDigitaltenuresthathecoauthoredwithAndreasReuter
his book entitled Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques.5 This book is arguably the
authoritativetreatiseontransactionprocessing,eventoday.
Jim joined Microsoft in 1995 as a Technical Fellow. He convinced Microsoft to open a research
center in San Francisco so that he and his wife, Donna Carnes, would not have to move to
Redmond, Washington. The center became Microsoft’s Bay Area Research Center. It was there
thatJimimmersedhimselfinthestudyofmassivedatabases.
One of Jim’s first projects at Microsoft was the development of a web site that he called
TerraServer.TerraServeruseddatafromthecommercialsatelliteindustrytobringhigh-resolution
imageryof theplanetEarth online.Previouslyavailableonlytointelligenceagencies and weather
forecasters, detailed pictures of anywhere on earth became available to the masses seven years
beforetheintroductionof GoogleEarth. TerraServer becameatthetimethe largestdatabase on
theInternet.
Jim mingled freely with a wide range of scientists and technologists. An avid sailor, he hosted on
his boat many astronomers, oceanographers, geologists, geneticists, and those from manyother
disciplines. He had an interest in each of these fields, and he collaborated with these
technologistsonabroadarrayofprojects.
For example, he teamed with astronomer Alex Szalay of Johns Hopkins University to port a
massive star-mapping project – the Sloan Digital Sky Survey – to the web. This made
astronomical data available via the Internet to professional astronomers, to backyard stargazers
andtostudents.Sinceitsdebutin2001,thisdatahasbecomethemostwidelyusedastronomical
resource in the world, supporting many discoveries of dwarf galaxies, dark matter, other planets,

Jim oncetoldmeof his problems insharinglargedatabases thathadtobedistributedamongthe
scientific community. It rapidly became clear to him that it was faster to mail a hard disk (three
days) than it was to transmit a terabyte database over even the fastest communication channel
(twoweeks).Thiswasamajorhurdletothesharingofverylargedatabases.
In 1998, Jim was the recipient of the prestigious Turing Award for “seminal contributions to
databaseandtransactionprocessingresearchandtechnicalleadershipinsystemimplementation
from research projects to commercial products.” Awarded by the Association of Computing
Machinery (ACM) and often referred to as the Nobel Prize of computing, the Turing Award is
presented once a year to "an individual selected for contributions of a technical nature made to
the computing community. The contributions should be of lasting and major technical importance
tothecomputerfield.”

The Search
WhenJim failedtoshowuptheeveningof his departuretotheFarallonIslands,theCoastGuard
initiated a search for him. At this point, it was a standard search, since boats are often reported
missing only to show up hours later or at some other port. However, as time went on, the search
for Jim became one of the most massive search-and-rescue missions in history. Before it was
over:
 theCoastGuardhadscoured132,000squaremilesofoceanbyairandsea.
 teams of scientists and Silicon Valley power players had steered satellites and NASA
planes over a swath of ocean from southern California to Oregon and 300 miles out to
sea.
 oceanographers and engineers from the U.S. Navy and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab had
joinedin.
 thousands of volunteers around the world had searched satellite images for any sign of
theTenacious.
As all sailors should, Jim carried an EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon)
onboard.AnEPIRBwillemitasignal when inthe water toguidesearch-and-rescueoperations to
thescene.No EPIRBsignal was ever heard, nor was aMaydaycallfrom Jim.There was nosign
of flotsam from the boat floating in the water or washed up on shore. In short, the Tenacious had
disappearedwithoutatrace.
The Coast Guard initially searched 40,000 square miles of ocean without success. After three
days, they announced that they were calling off the search. At this point, the Friends of Jim, a
large group of technologists and corporate executives, came out of nowhere to start their own
search.Microsoftlet it be known thatmoneyfor thesearch was no object.TheCoastGuardthen
reversed its decision and greatly expanded its search, using computer simulations to determine
wheretheboatmighthavedriftedintheeventoftheincapacityofitsskipper.
The Coast Guard pressed into service C-130 aircraft, helicopters, and patrol boats to widen the
search. They investigated the logs and hulls of any ships that might have struck the Tenacious.
TheCanadianSpace Agencyflewone of their satellites withcloud-piercingradar over thesearch
area.ThiswasfollowedbyscansfromDigitalGlobe’sQuickBirdandGeoEye’sIkonos.
The crunching of all of this satellite data was going to be a massive effort. Amazon turned
Mechanical Turk to the task. Mechanical Turk is an Amazon service that allows online workers to
cooperate in massive tasks. Five days after Jim’s disappearance, Werner Vogels, CTO of
Amazon and a close friend of Jim’s, posted a request on his blog entitled “Help find Jim Gray.”
More than 12,000 volunteers signed up and set about scanning satellite images of the search
area. The question was, “Is that a white cap or a boat.” Over the weekend, 30,000 square miles
of ocean had been scanned. Twenty specks were tagged as “likely,” and one was tagged as
“highly likely.” But the data was stale. If one of these specks were the Tenacious, where would it
havedrifted?
A team of ocean modelers was assembled. Using Coast Guard radio buoys and other sensing
devices, they attempted to predict the drift trajectory. All leads were tracked byflights but with no
results.
Two weeks later, Jim’s wife, Donna Carnes, chartered a fishing boat. Accompanied by a marine
search expert, they set out for the Farallon Islands to interview the resident naturalist. Access to
the islands, an important wildlife reserve, was limited; but the office of Nancy Pelosi, House
Speaker of the U.S. Congress, arranged clearance so that they could talk to the naturalist. As
they approached the islands, they had to traverse a maze of debris, including many large logs,

any of which could have pierced Tenacious’ hull. But the interview yielded nothing except a

In Spring, Donna Carnes employed a private company to comb the ocean floor with side-scan
sonar and remote-operated underwater vehicles. Three-and-a-half months later, nothing had

Jim Gray was one of the brightest technologists of our time, and his work is felt every day by
almost everyone. He was also one of the most humble. When conference hosts introduced him
asadatabaseguru,hewouldsimplysay“I’mjustaprogrammer.”
Jim also had a great sense of humor. In his article referenced above in which he described the
rapid increase in transaction processing performance, he concluded with, “The next article in this
series, scheduled for April Fools’ Day 2025, will show that a $1 wrist watch can run the world
economyas of 1990.Since cellphones arealreadyat agigabyteof storageandapproachaGHz

He was as bullish on massive databases as he was on transaction-processing performance. In a
1999 posting on the Microsoft web site announcing his receipt of the Turing Award,6 he was
quotedas saying,“‘Asecondgoal … is toturn computers into virtuallibrarians thatcanstore and
summarize massive amounts of data and present this data to users in a convenient way.
Someday, you're going to have a personal digital assistant that is watching and listening to
everything that is going on around you, It's going to have a few petabytes of information to work
with. And you're going to say, 'I was talking to this guy, he was somewhere in San Francisco, he
had a beard, it was about 30 years ago. Now what did he say?' And this thing is going to hunt
aroundandcomeback andgive youaclip… telling youthis.Itsoundslikesciencefiction,butit's
actuallydoable.’”
If Jim is really gone – and many still do not accept that – he leaves behind his wife, Donna, his
daughter, Heather, and his grandson, Sam. But as Steve Silberman concluded in his wonderful
article on Jim, “Even his disappearance proved a sort of mentoring, providing a template for
networkedsearch-and-rescuethatmightsavecountlesslivesinthefuture.”
