Rule attribute selector causing flag targeting web interface to crash

Incident Report for [LaunchDarkly](/)

Postmortem

On September 30 we introduced a bug in our frontend code that resulted
in an error page being displayed when attempting to use the rule
attribute selector (the first dropdown when creating or editing a
targeting rule). This bug only affected environments where one or more
private attributes had been declared within a LaunchDarkly SDK. Once we
became aware of the issue we were able to revert the change and restore
full functionality.

Our tests did not cover the case of private attributes for this
component, which is why the bug was not caught earlier in our
development cycle. Going forward, we are implementing both unit tests
and integration tests that will exercise this and other frontend code
when private attributes are in use.
