# A fire in a Telstra exchange is causing flight delays and network outages 

A fire at a Telstra exchange in Chatswood, in Sydney's north, has
disrupted communications across the city and forced Jetstar to delay
several flights

A Telstra spokesperson told Business Insider that fire was contained but
had damaged some of the power infrastructure.

"As a result a number customers are experiencing loss of service. Our
technicians are currently completing a full assessment of the impact. We
will provide more information as soon as it is available," they said.

> A fire at one of our exchanges is impacting some mobile and fixed
> services. We\'re working to resolve ASAP. Thanks for your patience.

But the problems for Telstra appear to be more widespread, with the
website AussieOutages.com reporting problems in various state capitals,
including Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide. People are complaining
that NBN connections, landline and mobile services, including SMS, are
failing.

The problems have also hit discount airline Jetstar, forcing them to
manually check in customers, with at least nine flights delayed.
