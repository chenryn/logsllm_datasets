OpenStackCompute
OpenStack Compute provides all of the facilities necessary to support the life cycle of instances in the
OpenStack cloud. It creates a redundant and scalable computing platform comprising large networks of
virtual machines. It provides the software, control panels, and APIs necessary for orchestrating a cloud,
includingrunninginstances,managingnetworks,andcontrollingaccesstothecloud.

OpenStackStorage
OpenStack Storage is modeled after Amazon’s EBS (Elastic Block Store) mass store. It provides

OpenStackImageService
OpenStack Image Service is a retrieval system for virtual-machine images. It provides registration,
discovery, and delivery services for these images. It can use OpenStack Storage or Amazon S3 (Simple
Storage System) for storage of virtual-machine images and their associated metadata. It provides a

The Demise of the Helion Public Cloud
After announcing its public cloud, HP realized that it could not compete with the giants of the industry,
Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure, in the public-cloud space. Therefore, HP (now HPE) sunsetted its
HelionpubliccloudprograminJanuary,2016.
However,HPEcontinuestopromoteitsprivateandhybridcloudsbyhelpingcustomersbuildcloud-based
applications based on HPE Helion OpenStack and the HPE Helion Development Platform. It provides
interoperability with Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure. It acquired Eucalyptus, a company that offers
private-cloudtechnologythatinteroperateswithAmazonAWS.
HPE supports customers who want to run HPE’s Cloud Foundry platform for development in their own
privatecloudsorinlarge-scalepubliccloudssuchasAWSorAzure.
The Helion Private Cloud – The HPE Helion CloudSystem
Building a custom private cloud to support an organization’s native cloud applications can be a complex
projectthattakesmonthstocomplete.Thisistoolongatimeifimmediateneedsmustbeaddressed.The
Helion CloudSystem reduces deployment time to days and avoids the high cost of building a proprietary
privatecloudsystem.
The HPE Helion CloudSystem was announced in March 2015. It is a secure private cloud delivered as a
preconfigured and integrated infrastructure. The infrastructure, called the HPE Helion Rack, is an
OpenStack private-cloud computing system ready for deployment and management. It comprises a
minimum of eightHPProLiantphysicalservers toprovideperformanceandavailability.Theservers runa
hardened versionof Linux, hLinux,optimized tosupportHelion. Additionalservers canbeadded as bare-
metalserversorasvirtualserversrunningontheKVMhypervisor.
The Helion CloudSystem is fully integrated with the HP Helion Development Platform. Since the Helion
CloudSystemisbasedontheopen-sourceOpenStackcloud,thereisnovendorlock-in.
HP’s white paper, “HP Helion Rack solution architecture,”1 is an excellent guide to the Helion
CloudSystem.
Helion Cloud Broker Services
HPE extends the private cloud services offered by the Helion CloudSystem by providing hybrid cloud
management with its Helion Managed Cloud Broker. This service is designed to solve the problems of
managing cloud and IT services from in-house and external providers. It brokers public-cloud platforms
for customers who wish to distribute workloads both on-premises with a Helion CloudSystem private
cloud and off-premises using other public-cloud platforms such as Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure. It
alsosupportsvirtualizedenvironmentsusingVMware.
The Helion Managed Cloud Broker supports the entire Helion portfolio. It is a universal system for both
on-premises private clouds and off-premises public clouds. It offers customers a self-service portal,
monitoring dashboards, and management services for security, performance, budgets, and application
life-cycle.
HPE also will help organizations become their own cloud brokers. Via its Helion Managed Cloud
Services,itprovidesthefollowingguidancetocustomers:
