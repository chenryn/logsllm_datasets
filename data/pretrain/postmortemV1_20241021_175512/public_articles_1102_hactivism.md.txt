Hacktivism
February2016
Hacktivism is the act of hacking, or breaking into a computer system, for a politically or
socially motivated purpose. The individual who performs an act of hacktivism is said to
be a hacktivist. Hacktivists are not cybercriminals. They do not hack into computer systems to steal
moneyordata.Rather,theyhackintocomputersystems-typicallywebsites-tomakeastatement.
A recent report by Imperva, “Hacker Intelligence Summary Report: The Anatomy of an Anonymous
Attack,”1 describes in detail an attempted assault by the hacktivist group ‘Anonymous,’ an assault that
lasted 25days.Thoughthe attack was unsuccessful,thestrategythat Anonymous usedtoperpetratethe
attack was closely analyzed by Imperva. The analysis leads to some important strategies to protect a
company’scomputingassetsfromsuchattacks.
A key finding is to monitor social media for indications of such attacks. Since it is the purpose of the
hacktivist to make a statement, there often are many mentions of the impending attack on Twitter,
Facebook, YouTube, and other social-media forums that can give a company time to prepare for the
attack.
Anonymous
Anonymous2 is a loosely associated international network of hacktivists. A website associated with the
groupdescribes it as "anInternetgathering" with "a verylooseanddecentralized commandstructurethat
operates on ideas rather than directives." The group became known for a series of distributed denial-of-
service(DDoS)attacksongovernment,religious,andcorporatewebsites.
Anonymous originated in 2003 and represented the views of many online and offline
communityusers.Anonymous members canbedistinguished in public bythe wearing

In its early form, the Anonymous concept was adopted by a decentralized online
community acting anonymously in a coordinated manner, usually toward a loosely
self-agreed goal. Beginning in 2008, the Anonymous collective increasingly became associated with
collaborative hacktivism on a number of issues internationally. Individuals claiming to align themselves
with Anonymous undertook protests in retaliation against anti-digital piracy campaigns by motion picture
and recording industry trade associations. Later targets of Anonymous hacktivism included government
agencies, ISIS, child pornographysites, copyright protection agencies, and corporations such as PayPal,
MasterCard,Visa,andSony.

interesting attack campaigns. These research papers aim to understand not solely what has happened in

A review of Imperva’s HII report, “The Anatomy of an Anonymous Attack,” provides the background for
thisarticle.
The Anatomy of an Anonymous Attack
In 2011, the hactivist group Anonymous attempted to launch an attack against the web site of an
unidentifiedcompany. Thepreparationandfinalattack was carriedoutover atwenty-fivedayperiod.The
web site had a web-application firewall deployed that recorded and repelled the attacks.Byanalyzing the
traffic logs, the Imperva Application Defense Center was able to identify the attack method. The Imperva
team also analyzed Anonymous’ social media communications in the days leading up to the attack to
understand the preparations that Anonymous took. Imperva believes that this is the first end-to-end
recordofafullAnonymousattack.
ReactiveversusProactiveAttacks
InitsstudyofAnonymousattacks,Impervadeterminedthatattacksfellintotwocategories:
Reactive – Some incidents inspired Anonymous to attack a target. For instance, when MasterCard, Visa,
and others stopped allowing payments to Wikileaks, Anonymous launched Operation Payback, intended
tobringdowntheirwebsiteswithexcessivetrafficviaDDoS(distributeddenial-of-service)attacks.
Proactive–Inaproactiveattack,Anonymousannouncedanintentiontoattackatarget.
The Anonymous attack that is the subject of this Imperva report was a proactive attack. In this case,
Anonymous hoped to disrupt an event that would take place on a specified date. A website that enabled

Recruiting(Days1-18)
Recruiting took place over the first eighteen days. A small group of Anonymous instigators leveraged
social media to promote their message and campaign and to recruit members. They created a website
justifying an attack on their target. They used Twitter and Facebook to promote traffic to their website.
Additionally,YouTubevideoswereproducedtohelprationalizetheattacks.
Anonymous requested interested participants to contact them and sign up for the attack. After they had
persuadedthousandsofvolunteerstojoin,Anonymous’skilledhackersbegantheirreconnaissance.
Reconnaissance(Days19-23)
The reconnaissance phase took place over the next five days. Around ten to fifteen skilled hackers
probed the website’s applications in an effort to identify weaknesses that could lead to a data breach.
They used commonly-available vulnerability assessment tools such as Acunetix, which checks for XSS
(cross-sitescripting),SQLinjection,andotherwebvulnerabilities.Thehackershidtheirtrueidentitiesand
placesofoperation.
They also attempted to use attack software specifically designed to steal data. One such tool was Havij,
whichis believedtohavebeendeveloped byIran.Havij conducts ahigh volumeof SQLinjectionattacks,
performingdataextractionandharvesting.
However,theattackerswereunabletoidentifyanyweaknessthatcouldleadtoadatabreach.
Attack(Days24–25)
Having failed tofind a way toexposedata, the hackers turned to their base of volunteers obtained during
Anonymous’ recruitment phase. Several thousand people either downloaded attack software or went to
oneofAnonymous’custom-builtwebsitesthatperformDDoSattacks.
The Anonymous custom DDoS website is called the low-orbit ion canon (LOIC). It is just a few hundred
lines of Javascript code and can run on mobile devices. When the website is opened via a browser in a
PC or in a mobile device, it generates multiple requests to the victim’s website. Each request has a
variable parameter (the date/time in milliseconds) to avoid the response being in the website’s cache
memory, thus consuming much more of the website’s computing resources. Using this tool, a PC can
generateabout200requestspersecond.Theattacksgeneratedabout500,000requestspersecond.
However, when the DDoS attack failed after two days of bombarding the target website with traffic, the
attackended.
Detection and Mitigation
Understanding the Anonymous attack methodology leads to strategies to detect and mitigate such
attacks.
MonitorSocialMedia
Hacktivism is “loud” by definition. The hacktivists want everyone to know that they are going to attack a
site. Besides, this advertisement of their intentions is a way to recruit volunteers to join in the attack.
Hacktivists use all of the social media the Web offers – Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, blogspot, pastebin,
etc.

A convenient way to monitor the Web for signs of an attack is to use Google Alerts. A Google Alert will

In this study, the DDoS attack was preceded by days of reconnaissance. This reconnaissance
undoubtedlygenerated a mass of alertmessages from the website’s securityfacilities. Byensuring these
alerts are scrutinized, a company can strengthen its security policy and be better prepared for an attack.

Attackers prefer small-scale,effectivecampaigns that donotrequirea massiverecruitmentof volunteers.
Therefore, companies should make it their priority to close application vulnerabilities. They then should

Summary
Proactive attacks such as the one analyzed in this Imperva study are well-advertised in advance. By
following social media for messages about your company, you may be able to detect such an attack in
advance,includingitsdateandthemethodofattack.
Given this information, it then is very important to monitor your security alert messages so that
reconnaissance attempts by an attacker can be blocked. Finally, you should have a DDoS mitigation
strategy in place (such as using a DDoS mitigation service) in case DDoS is the final attack methodology
usedbytheperpetrator.
