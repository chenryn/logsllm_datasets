More Never Agains
August2008
We continue our tradition of reviewing just a small portion of computer failures (and a couple of
other interesting failures) that have occurred over the first six months of 2008. In our previous
article published a half-year ago,1 we noted that one-third of all problems were power-related.
Thattrendcontinues. 25% ofthe28storiesbelowhavetodowithpowerfailures ofvariouskinds.
In addition, five of the following incidents were caused by upgrades, usually with no failback
procedureinplace.

tf.nist.gov/stations/wwvoutages.htm –Maintainingtimesynchronizationis veryimportantformany
applications. If your system time must be kept tightly synchronized with civil real time, access to
an accurate clock is required. One such clock is the time signal broadcast byWWV, operated by
the National Institute of Standards and Technology.2 But if your mission-critical application really
depends on civil-time synchronization, you should plan on a backup time source. Over a recent
seven-month period, WWV was down five times for periods up to six hours, exhibiting an
