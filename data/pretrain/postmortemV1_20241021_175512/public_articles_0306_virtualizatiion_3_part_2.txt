TheRequirementforFaultTolerance
In a one-application, one-server environment, if a server fails, that application fails. The pain is
felt, but it is limited. However, if a virtualized server (that is, a server supporting several virtual
machines) fails, all of the applications running in the virtual machines on that server are down.
This is a pain of a greater magnitude. If the server is running many mission-critical applications,
thepaincouldwellbeintolerable.
In the general case, good practices demand that no more than one application running on a
virtualized server be mission-critical. In this way, if a server fails, only one critical application is
lost.Thelossoftheotherapplicationsforashortwhileispresumablytolerable.
However,this typeof configurationcannotalways be accomplishedor beguaranteed. Themix of
applications in a data center may involve so many critical applications that more than one will
have to be assigned to the same physical server. Moreover, failover actions may consolidate
multiple critical applications on a single server. Even worse, in a pooled environment used for
load balancing, there may be no control over where an application runs. It is quite likely that at
timesmultiplecriticalapplicationswillberesidentonasingleserver.Aservercrashcanthentake
downseveralcriticalapplicationsallatonce.
This dilemma is solved by the use of fault-tolerant servers. A fault-tolerant server is one that is
designed to survive any single fault and many cases of multiple faults without any service
interruptionorlossofworkinprocess.Afailureiscompletelytransparenttotheuser.
Fault-tolerant servers have been measured in the field to have average times between failures
thatareordersofmagnitude–uptoahundredtimesormore–longerthanthoseexperiencedby
standard high-availability servers. High-availability servers in common use tend to have
availabilities of three 9s – that is, they will be up 99.9% of the time and will be down about eight
hours per year. On the other hand, fault-tolerant servers experience availabilities of more than
five9s.Theywillbeupmorethan99.999% of thetimeand will experience less thanfiveminutes

Standard industryservers canprovide highavailability. Fault-tolerantsystems providecontinuous
availability. The use of fault-tolerant servers in virtualized environments can significantly reduce
the pain of server crashes taking down mission-critical applications or even groups of important
butnotcriticalapplications.
DisasterRecovery
Disaster recovery is the capability to continue operations even if an entire data center is lost.
Today,therearenodisasterrecoveryproductsspecifictovirtualization.Rather,standarddisaster
recovery techniques can be employed. The first step, of course, is to have two data centers that

Some fault-tolerant systems allow the redundant processors to be separated, in some cases up

data centers (as is usually the case), asynchronous replication engines may be used to maintain

Fault-tolerant systems generally provide some sort of disaster-recovery facilities. Note that
disaster recovery is different from disaster tolerance. Disaster recovery means recovering from a
disaster. Disaster tolerance means to be unaffected by a disaster. Active/active systems4 provide

disaster.
Virtualization Products for High Availability
All of the functions required for high availability described above are provided by one or more
currentproducts.
VirtualMachineFailover
Virtually all virtualization products today support virtual machine failover. Should a VM fail in an
otherwise operable physical server, the hypervisor will detect that and will restart the VM in that
server.
Suchproductsinclude:
 VMwareESXserver
 Xen(opensource)andXenSource(fromCitrix)
 VirtualIron(basedontheXenhypervisor)
 SunSolarisoperatingsystem
 SWsoftfromVirtuozzo
Clustering
Clustering provides failover of virtual machines from a crashed physical server to one or more
surviving physical servers that may be running their own VMs. VMs may also be failed over to
support load balancing and maintenance and upgrade activities with no interruption to the users.
Theseproductsinclude:
 VMwareVMotion
 VirtualIronLiveMigration
ServerPooling
Server pooling organizes several virtualized physical servers into a pool that itself is virtualized.
To outside users, the server pool appears as a single virtualized server. VMs can be freely (and
automatically) moved around the pool for load balancing, and they can be moved to eliminate
downtime during planned maintenance and upgrades. VMs that were resident in a failed physical
servercanbemovedtooneormoresurvivingphysicalservers.
Productsthatprovideserverpoolinginclude:
 VMwareDRS(DistributedResourceScheduler)
 VirtualIronLiveMigration
Fault-Tolerant Servers
Even with clustering and pooling, the failure of a physical server can mean minutes to hours of
downtime for its hosted applications as virtual machines are moved to surviving servers,
applications are restarted, and corrupt databases are repaired. The use of fault-tolerant servers,
which can survive the failure of any single component as well as many multiple failures, can

HP NonStop servers (formerly Tandem Computers) are the granddaddy of fault-tolerant
virtualization. Since the late 1970s, these systems have been presenting a single-system image
ofmultipleapplicationsrunningoverhundredsofprocessors.
However, in this series, we are interested in the virtualization of industry-standard servers and
Windows, Unix, and Linux applications. To be useful for virtualization, fault-tolerant servers must
be x86-based since all current hypervisors today expect an x86 platform. Products that can be
usedasvirtualizedfault-tolerantplatformsincludethefollowing.
StratusftServer
Stratus Technologies of Maynard, Massachusetts, (www.stratus.com) provides the fault-tolerant
ftServer.5 The ftServer comprises two processors with redundant I/O channels running in lock-
step. Included in the ftServer is 1.5 terabytes of mirrored (RAID 1) disks. Therefore, network
attached storage (NAS) or storage area networks (SAN) are often not necessary. The direct-
attached storage of the ftServer is fully redundant and can withstand any single failure. Stratus
posts operational availabilities on their home page as measured by current field failures. More
thanfive9sofavailabilityaretypicallydisplayed.
Stratus has integrated VMware’s ESX server into their line of fault-tolerant ftServers. As a bare-
metal hypervisor, ESX runs directly on top of the ftServer processor. Guest operating systems
supportedbyftServerincludeWindowsandRedHatLinux.
For disaster tolerance, Stratus uses the Double-Take asynchronous replication engine to
replicate Windows databases to a remote site, and it uses the GoldenGate replication engine to
replicateLinuxdatabases.
StratusAvance
Stratus’ newly-announced Avance fault-tolerant product uses a pair of industry-standard servers
in a fault-tolerant configuration. The servers can be running either Windows or Linux. As
transactions are executed on one system, changes to the database are replicated synchronously
to the other system over a one gigabit/second private link.The two systems can be separated by
up to a half a kilometer. Via Stratus’ professional services, a third node can be provided as a
disasterrecoverysiteatanydistanceusingasynchronousreplication.
Should its database mirror fail, the active processor can use the mirror on the backup system
over the high-speed intersystem link. Should the active processor fail, users are routed to the
backup system, which now becomes the active system. Because of the synchronous data
replication,nodataislostfollowingthefailureoftheactivesystem.
Stratus has integrated the Citrix Xen hypervisor into Avance to provide the support for a
virtualized environment.With Avance, failover of the entire virtual environment is simply a matter
ofreroutingusers.
MarathoneverRun
everRun FT, from Marathon Technologies (www.marathontechnologies.com of Littleton, Mass.,
uses two standard Windows servers integrated with Citrix’s XenSource hypervisor to provide
fault-tolerant virtualization. The servers are interconnected by a dual gigabit Ethernet channel.
The servers execute the same code at the same time and are synchronized at the instruction
level.Thismeansthateachserverwillwritethesamedatatoitsdisk subsystematthesametime
as the other server. Therefore, database replication is synchronous; and no data is lost should

In the event of a server failure, the surviving server continues in operation with no impact to the
user.When the failed server is returned to service, its database is resynchronized with the active
database;andfault-tolerantoperationcontinues.

Summary
Virtualization is an extremely important and effective technology to reduce the IT costs of data
centers. It has the potential to increase server utilization from 15% or less to 70% or more. As a
result, the size of the server farm can be significantly reduced, less space with its environmental
HVACcontrolsisrequired,andenergyusagecanbecutbyalargefactor.
But virtualization brings with it a major problem. As opposed to the one-application, one-server
model, should a virtualized server fail, many applications are brought down. If some of these are
mission-critical to the organization, the cost of this downtime could be very high in terms of lost
business,customerdissatisfaction,regulatorypenalties,andsoon.
Many virtualization products bring failover capabilities to a virtualized data center. However,
failover following a physical server crash can take minutes to hours as applications are brought
upandascorrupteddatabasesarerepaired.
Fault-tolerant servers solve this problem. Through their dual-modular redundancy, these servers
cancontinuetoservicetheir users with noloss of work followinganysinglefault andmanycases
of multiple faults. Especially when the cost of downtime is considered, virtualized fault tolerance
can bring continuous availability to a data center at a competitive cost and with no special
administrativeskills.
