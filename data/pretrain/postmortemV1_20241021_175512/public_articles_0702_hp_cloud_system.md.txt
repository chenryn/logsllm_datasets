HP CloudSystem
February2012
The cloud is today’s technical darling. By moving applications to the cloud, organizations can eliminate
capital expenditures, reduce operating costs, and deploy applications rapidly. Compute, storage, and
network capacity can be provisioned as needed; and a company pays only for what it uses. We have
describedoneoftheleadingcloudprovidersinourarticleAmazonAvailabilityZones.1
However, given all of the obvious advantages of cloud computing, companies are slow in moving to the
cloud. Serious issues remain concerning security, availability, and governance - the control required to
conform to corporate policies. Nevertheless, a recent study by Forrester Research, Inc., found that
employees of manycompanies are movingsomeapplications and datatothecloud withoutmanagement
orIT departmentapproval.Forresterindicatesthatsuchsurreptitioususeofthecloudisfivetimesgreater
thanwhatITthinks.
There are three fundamental types of clouds – private, public, and hybrid. A private cloud is owned and
operated by a company for its own purposes. A public cloud is provided by a cloud service provider for
use by any of its subscribers on a pay-for-usage basis. A hybrid cloud is a private cloud that can reach
intoapubliccloudforadditionalcapacityorservices.
Many of the advantages of cloud computing can be achieved by a company with its own private cloud,
thus addressing the concerns surrounding public cloud computing. In fact, if a company(as many are) is
wellonits waytousing virtualization toconsolidate its data-center assets,it is nota greatstepforward to

HPCloudSystem Matrix
HP CloudSystem Matrix implements a private cloud. It provides an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
implementation in which computing resources can be dynamically assigned to applications on as-needed
basis.HPCloudSystemMatrixformstheunderpinninguponwhichHP’sothercloudservicesarebuilt.
Though based on HP’s BladeSystem, HP CloudSystem Matrix is a highly heterogeneous, multi-
hypervisor, multi-OS infrastructure that can take advantage of an organization’s current IT assets. It
supports not only HP Integrity and Proliant servers but also x86 servers from Dell and IBM. Supported
storage area networks (SANs) include HP products (XP, EVA, 3PAR) and EMC storage. Networking by
HP, Cisco, Brocade, and Alcatel-Lucent is supported. On the software side, Windows, Linux, and HP-UX
aresupportedaswellasVMware,Microsoft’sHyperV,andHPIntegrityVirtualMachinehypervisors.
Security- and compliance-monitoring spanning applications and virtual- and physical infrastructure are
providedbyArcSight.
Anapplicationisdefinedbyatemplatecalleda“CloudMap.”Itspecifiestheresourcesthatanapplication
needs, the relationships among the resources, and any policies that pertain to the provisioning of these
resources for the application. Cloud Maps, described later, are provided for many popular applications
suchasthosefromMicrosoftandSAP.
To run an application, all one needs to do is to specify the application template. HP CloudSystem will
search for the required resources and will assign them to the application. An application instance can be
provisionedandrunningwithinafewminutes.Iflaterontheapplicationrequires moreresources,itwillbe
assigned those additional resources. When the resources are no longer needed, they will be returned to
the resource pool. The use of resources by an application is metered and can be charged back to the
usingorganizationwithinthecompany.
Should there be a failure of a resource, such as a server or a storage device, failed resources can be
reallocated to operational resources with a single click via recovery scripts that have been preprepared
andtested.
A self-service infrastructure portal acts as a single pane of glass to monitor and to manage HP

 application monitoring and management over the application’s lifecycle, from provisioning to

 uptimeassurancewithsingle-clickrecovery.
HPCloudSystemEnterprise
HP CloudSystem Enterprise extends HP CloudSystem Matrix to the public cloud. HP CloudSystem
EnterprisesupportsIaaS,PaaS(PlatformasaService),andSaaS(SoftwareasaService)functionality.
HP CloudSystem Enterprise can “burst” private cloud services to one or more public clouds according to
policies set forth in an application’s Cloud Map. Multiple resource pools can be organized hierarchically
and can be managed according to corporate policies. Public cloud services may be called upon, for
instance, to provision additional compute, storage, or networking capacity on an as-needed basis.
Another use for bursting into a public cloud might be to distribute application services on a geographical
basissothatlocalcommunitiesofuserscanbeservedwithhigherqualitiesofservice.

The self-service portal provides a single-service view of all environments – private clouds, public clouds,
and the company’s traditional IT environment. An enhanced application/infrastructure lifecycle
managementfacilityisprovided.
HPCloudSystemServiceProvider
HP CloudSystem Service Provider builds upon HP CloudSystem Enterprise and supports service
providers who are providing applications to their users as Software as a Service. HP CloudSystem
ServiceProvidercanplaytheroleofapubliccloudorofahostedprivatecloudforserviceproviders.
The system portal aggregates and manages all of the services being provided by HP CloudSystem
Service Provider. In addition, unique customer portals are available to give each hosted service provider
itsownlook-and-feel.
HP CloudSystem Service Provider comes with a sampling of prepackaged services, including Microsoft
Exchange,MicrosoftSharePoint,HPVirtualRoom,HPAudioConference,andBusinessVoiceServices.
Cloud Bursting
Cloud bursting is the act of reaching out into other clouds for additional capacity or service offerings. HP
CloudSystemburstingsupportsbothlocalandpublicbursting.
Local bursting allows workload and services to be sent to other private clouds managed by a company.
Local bursting is used if the application contains highly sensitive data or if company policies prohibit the
useofapubliccloudforsecurityorcompliancereasons.
Public bursting allows applications running in a private cloud to reach out to public clouds to manage
uneven service demands or to access other functionality. These services are typically available to a
companyonapay-for-what-you-usebasis.Publicburstingissubjecttocompanypoliciesinthesameway
thatprivatecloudapplicationsaremanaged.
Also supported is dual bursting, in which services may be invoked in other private clouds as well as in
public clouds. Bursting may either be automatic or may require approval before workload distribution
proceeds. All cloud services in a bursting environment are managed by a single management portal by
HPCloudSystem.
In order for a public cloud to participate in CloudSystem bursting, HP must have developed a
CloudSystem bursting connector for that cloud. The bursting connector passes provision and service
requests tothepublic cloud.Ittranslates CloudSystem calls intocalls thatthecloudprovider understands
and converts the cloud’s responses to CloudSystem format. HP is in the process of creating bursting
connectorsforitsCloudAgileburstingpartnerswhoprovidecloudservices.

MatrixOperatingEnvironment
The Matrix Operating Environment (MOE) is a common management platform that automates
infrastructuremanagement,includingserver,storage, and network resources and corebusiness security-
and regulatory policies. It enables rapid provisioning of complex infrastructure services and the
adjustment of these services to meet changing business demands by enabling in minutes the rapid
design,provisioning,andmodificationofacomplexinfrastructure.
MOE is based on HP Insight Dynamics for real-time provisioning and on HP Insight Control for lifecycle
management,powermanagement,andhealthmonitoring.MOEprovidesthefollowingfunctionality:
 ProvisioninginfrastructureinminutesfrompredefinedCloudMapsforeachapplication.
 Optimization by measuring every five minutes key parameters such as CPU and network

HP Cloud Service Automation (CSA) provides automation tools to deploy and manage cloud computing
applications in heterogeneous and extensible cloud-computing environments. It ensures service levels
through application lifecycle management, patch management, service governance, and compliance.
CSA can grow and shrink allocated resources across private and public clouds to meet service-level
requirements; and it delivers security, governance, and compliance across applications and across
physical-andvirtualinfrastructures
